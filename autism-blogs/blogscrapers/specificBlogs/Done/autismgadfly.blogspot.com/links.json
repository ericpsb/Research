{"date": " June 12, 2016", "body": "\nAutism diagnoses started to soar in the 1990s and those new cases are now adults in their early twenties.\u00a0 Society and the media have noted the need for employers to hire those on the spectrum.\u00a0\u00a0 This has lead to major media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times publishing articles on how autism is an advantage in the workplace and how it can land you a job.\u00a0 here's.The New York times article extolling that Danish Godsend Specialisterne. here's the Wall Street Journal piece about how easily autism can land you a job.\u00a0 These articles are intriguing as they make one ponder why in spite of this alleged advantage we have reported unemployment rates for autistics at 80% or higher.\n\nFreud said that love and work are the cornerstones of our humanity.\u00a0 Finding a significant other more often than not has been a formidable hurdle for many on the spectrum.\u00a0 One has to wonder why major publications such as the WSJ and the New York times won't address the problems autistics have with that other cornerstone, l'amour.\n\nSince the major media outlets won't write about this issue, I guess it's up to your humble blogger with his piddling little blog hardly anyone wants to read.\u00a0 So, you're going to hear it right now.\u00a0 Autism is an asset and an advantage with women and autism can land you a hot girlfriend!\n\nAutistics have great attention to details since they've done so well on the embedded figures tests and have done such a great job in detecting patterns in Simon Baron-Cohen's experiments.\u00a0 They will notice how nice a woman's dress is and be willing to compliment her on it.\u00a0 They will notice redeeming physical features of a woman that neurotypical men won't even see and will be able to shower her with compliments that neurotypical men can't.\n\nThough autistics rarely have children it continues increase at huge rates, having a mere prevalence of 1 in 2500 in the 1960s to the rates of 1 in 68 we see today.\u00a0 The reason for this must be because autism has an evolutionary advantage due to our superior genes.\u00a0 If women mate with us instead of neurotypical men, we'll be able to give them superior offspring.\u00a0 Hell, ladies, your child with us might become the next Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, or Thomas Jefferson.\u00a0 Since the exact genetic transmission of autistic traits is obscure, your children with us may have all of the advantages of autism and none of the disadvantages.\n\nTemple Grandin has stated that at least half of the silicone valley has autism and that we've come up with every invention from the spear to the cellphone.\u00a0 That means that your potential suitor may be the next billionaire.\u00a0 He'll be able to ensure you live a life of ease and buy you a villa on the French Riviera.\n\nAutistics also have sensory issues.\u00a0 This means that the man will be more sensitive and attentive to the woman's needs. \u00a0 \n\nAutistics are also overly loyal as has been reported in the media.\u00a0 That along with prejudice against us from women who aren't aware of all of our advantages means there's a much lower (if not zero) probability that we'll commit adultery if you marry us.\u00a0 Though there have been reports that divorces are higher among parents of autistic children than in the general population, this means your marriage will be more stable and there won't be the problems of divorce that make neurotypical marriages a coin flip chance.\u00a0 This is aside from the fact that Michael John Carley is divorced and remarried and John Elder Robison has been twice divorced and is now on his third (and hopefully final) marriage.\u00a0 Of course these are high functioning outliers, so most of us will be stable and there won't likely be a problem of divorce.\n\nChances are most women won't land a neurotypical billionaire.\u00a0 One problem with one of these men is that they'd insist the woman sign a prenup if they were to marry them.\u00a0 Due to the autistic billionaire's poor social judgment problems, they won't know any better than to insist their wife sign a prenup and in the unlikely event the marriage ends in divorce, the money will be community property in most states and the newly single woman will land a few billion smackers after a quickie divorce in Reno.\u00a0 These social skills aren't deficient, they're merely different and they aren't a disadvantage, they confer an actual advantage on those who are autistic.\n\nAutistic men also have loud voices.\u00a0 This means that if they're trying to hail a cab in new york city or trying to get the attention of a waiter in a busy restaurant, this will be a huge advantage on dates. \u00a0 \n\nWhat about situations in which these different social skills can be a disadvantage.\u00a0 After all, an autistic person might be more argumentative with their girlfriend and start shouting at them.\u00a0 They might be embarrassed to take them to a party their neurotypical friends are having as the autistic man may say or do something socially inappropriate.\u00a0 This shouldn't be a problem.\u00a0 After all, some might argue that this would adversely affect them in an employment situation and that those who say autism is an asset in employment are mistaken.\u00a0 Ari Ne'eman offered a solution to this some years ago.\u00a0 All we have to do to eliminate autistic unemployment is to end social pleasantry as a criteria for hiring employees and evaluating their job performance.\u00a0 No reason why we can't do this in dating situations also.\u00a0 No matter how inappropriately the autistic man acts, the woman can just eliminate social pleasantry as a criteria for picking a boyfriend.\u00a0 If he tells her best friend how much weight she's gained recently, it does not matter.\n\nNow that I've written this article that the New York Times and Wall Street Journal won't write, I'll be waiting for dating services to open up for women seeking suitors, where all the candidates will be autistic men and they'll extol all of these virtues we have.\u00a0 Maybe we can get the socialistic government of Denmark to provide the start-up money for this endeavor.\u00a0 Or maybe the current governor of Delaware and their state legislature will provide an $800,000 grant for such an enterprise.\u00a0 Since they both did this with Specialisterne and Thorkill Sonn it's only fair they do it for dating too.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links":

{"date": " March 10, 2016", "body": "\nGoing back to the days of Cure Autism Now in the late 90's and early 2000's, neurodiversity proponents have protested research into the genetics of autism, claiming that it would result in a prenatal test that would lead to mass abortions of autistic fetuses, such as what takes place with Down's syndrome, spina bifida, and perhaps other conditions that are far easier to detect in utero.\n\nAmanda Baggs and Laura Tisoncik, proprietors of autistics.org, had on the main page of their website a cartoon depicting a trashcan with the letters CAN written on it with an abortion clinic building in the background with a crude drawing supposed to represent an aborted autistic fetus with the caption \"the real meaning of autism prevention\".\u00a0 Ari Ne'eman has stated that he fears genetic research because it could lead to genetic testing.\u00a0 John Robison in a speech to IMFAR expressed concern that so many autistics he knew worried about these tests, though he acknowledged the possibility that it was the furthest thing from the genetic researchers mind.\u00a0 Meg Evans (writing under the pseudonym Bonnie Ventura) predicted in 2005 that in ten years' time there would be a prenatal test for autism.\u00a0 She proved to be a poor prophet. \n\nYears later, Autism Speaks in collaboration with Google initiated the Mssng project to find missing autism genes and developed a database of autism genes which all researchers would access.\u00a0 This resulted in a flurry of protest on twitter and perhaps other social media.\u00a0 #notmissing hashtags popped up on neurodiversity tweets and John Elder Robison joined in the fray.\u00a0 Neurodiversity took offense to the notion that they could be missing and that Autism Speaks was somehow insulting them. \n\nWhat's interesting is in that all of the years that Neurodiversity has been ranting and raving against CAN and then Autism Speaks, I've never heard a peep out of them about the Simons Foundation or the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. \n\nJames Simons is a mathematician who applied his research findings to the stock market and created an extremely lucrative hedge fund that averaged more than thirty-five percent annual returns.\u00a0 This, at least in part, resulted in him accumulating a net worth of around 17 billion dollars, making him the 88th richest man in the United States according to the latest Forbes 400 listing.\u00a0 He has an autistic daughter named Audrey who I think is in her twenties now and is at the milder end of the spectrum (anyone is welcome to correct me in the comments section if I'm wrong about this). \n\nWith his huge wealth he created a foundation in his name to do research in education, health and other matters.\u00a0 This included something called the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (abbreviated SFARI).\u00a0 Though Autism Speaks is a far more prominent and well-known organization than SFARI, Simons is a larger funder of research than AS is. \n\nWhat is noteworthy is this story about SFARI's introducing the new genetic database which is certainly not dissimilar to the one that Autism Speaks created with Google's help and from neurodiversity's point of view could just as easily result in a prenatal test and abortion of autistic fetuses.\n\nAs can be seen\u00a0 from this ten year old article in the wall street journal Jim Simons gave geneticist Michael Wigler a nearly 14 million dollar research grant to find genetic causes of autism.\u00a0 They were also friendly, vacationing off the coast of Greenland together.\n\nWigler's (as well as colleague Jonathan Sebat's) research is interesting in that it seems to find that a fair amount of autism is caused not by genes that are adaptive and stay in the population, but in spontaneous mutations that are not inherited.\u00a0 This provides some evidence against the neurodiversity dictum that autistic genes stayed in the population because they offered some sort of advantage and that autism is a natural variation that has always stayed in the population, or that elimination of autism would result in a sort of genocide. \n\nSo, one has to ponder why neurodiversity is not at war with the Simons Foundation.\u00a0 Why aren't they calling out Jim Simons as a greedy tycoon who takes money away from autism communities, so that services, research on AAC, and other pet projects of ASAN aren't being done?\u00a0 This is a complaint that ASAN has lodged repeatedly against autism speaks. \n\nGadfly must concede that one of the differences between Autism Speaks and the Simons Foundation is that in order to obtain revenue, autism speaks must engage in advertising.\u00a0 Some of this advertising has been offensive to those in the ND movement.\u00a0 They were angry about Allison Singer's dumb remarks about driving herself and her daughter off a bridge, they were angry at Suzanne Wright's statements that autism families were not really living (resulting in Robison's resignation from their science advisory board), and they were horrified at the I am Autism video.\u00a0 The Simons Foundation is independently wealthy thanks to all of Jim's billions and they don't need to engage in this sort of publicity so they won't provoke the ire of ASAN, GRASP, and the rest of ND. \n\nOne of the problems with this line of thought though, is that genetic research, particularly databases which all scientists will have access to, regardless of whether it is funded by Autism Speaks, the Simons Foundation or anyone else will have the same result.\u00a0 If Autism Speaks research could result in prenatal testing, so could Simons'.\u00a0 If Autism Speaks are a bunch of ogres who are ripping off the autism community, then Mr. Simons is just as culpable. \n\nOr perhaps the real answer is that neurodiversity doesn't really care about the issues of genetics or prenatal selection.\u00a0 Perhaps they just have low self-esteem due to mental problems or this is just the type of people they are.\u00a0 Perhaps Autism Speaks' advertising only reminds them of what they hate in themselves. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.genomeweb.com/business-news/simons-foundations-genomic-autism-dataset-available-wuxi-nextcode-database",

{"date": " March 5, 2016", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\"Life's like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get\" were the famous words of wisdom pontificated by Forrest Gump.\u00a0 That's been true in my case also.\u00a0 Though I'm now sixty (a sexagenarian without the sex) my life in the autism world continues with interesting adventures.\u00a0 My latest one was an invitation a couple of months ago to participate in a panel discussion on autism at Stanford University sponsored by their chapter of Autism Speaks U, the university clubs that Autism Speaks sponsors.\n\nI was nervous and apprehensive about the trip as I don't do well in travel situations and I wanted to save money by taking the train from San Jose airport to Palo Alto, but ended up biting the bullet and taking a taxi.\u00a0 Also, nervous about getting to the hotel at night, and not knowing what to do with nearly an entire day to kill in beautiful downtown Palo Alto.\u00a0 I did manage to kill some time walking around the area near where Stanford university is and explored it. \u00a0 \n\nAnother reason I wanted to take the trip is I have cousins who live in nearby Berkeley and I could spend an additional night and day with them after I finished my business at Stanford.\u00a0 They were also interested in coming to hear me speak on the panel.\u00a0 They were very happy to make the nearly 40 mile commute from Berkeley to PA and take me back to their apartment with them, so I wouldn't have to spend the second night in a motel.\n\nThe person organizing the event asked me for recommendations for other panelists and I gave them Roger Kulp's name, but there was no way they could afford to pay his travel expenses and I'm not sure he wanted to do it, so he declined.\n\nThey also invited well-known superstar Steven Shore who also expressed an interest in doing it.\u00a0 Steve is well known on the conference circuit and is able to command high speaking fees, but he's willing to waive them for the right cause.\u00a0 However, his travel expenses were also prohibitively high for this student group who only has limited funds.\n\nSo, there were three panelists, myself included.\u00a0 The other two panelists included Melissa Collins-Porter who has an interesting documentary in the works, called Aging Out which deals with the bleak prospects that autistic individuals over the age of 21 face when they age out of the special education system and have to face the cruel world.\u00a0 Melissa's autistic son is 16, so she's someone who has a loved one who is imminently facing this scenario.\u00a0 You can see her on my right in the above photo.\u00a0 She sat at the end so she could access her computer more easily when it was her turn to show a trailer from her documentary in progress.\u00a0 You can see it from the link. \n\nThe third panelist was Nate Majors, a young (24 years) man with autism who engages in self-advocacy.  He's local to the Palo Alto area.\u00a0 His mom accompanied him to the panel.\u00a0 Nate is currently in an accounting internship at PG&E in San Francisco.\u00a0 He seemed to have a slight speech impediment, but is overall a pretty functional autistic.\u00a0 He's sitting on my left, a bit further away from me and Melissa. \n\nThey served some good pizza and bagels and I helped myself to a piece of pizza.\u00a0 It was a pretty good turnout, about 30 people showed up, mostly Stanford undergraduate students.\u00a0\n\nThey asked some interesting questions, including some stuff about the cure debate.\u00a0 Nate did not want a cure for himself.\u00a0 Melissa did not want a cure for her son, though she seemed to want to end his OCD symptomatology and some other problems, so she seemed to want to have it both ways.\u00a0 Wanting to have your cake and eat it too as my former psychoanalyst used to say.\u00a0 I gave my more nuanced view as of late, stating that though I longed for a cure for autism, I realized it was not a realistic goal in my lifetime and repeated what Andrew Solomon stated in \"Far From the Tree\" that it was sort of like a debate about intergalactic space travel.\u00a0\n\nThey also asked about what we felt people should know about autism and I stated I felt the media should know we are not all savants and we don't have these superior abilities that make us great with computers and will translate into a lucrative career and that we could not all multiply four digit numbers in our heads or knew whether a one-hundred digit number was prime or composite.\u00a0 That got a few guffaws from the audience.\u00a0 I also stated people should try to fix us up with dates and friends and this struck an amusing cord with the college students.\u00a0 Overall I seemed to elicit more reactions from the audience than the other two panelists.\u00a0\n\nAmusingly enough, one of the questions was from a quote of one of my favorite autism writers, John Elder Robison about how autism was both a gift and a disability and it was the fire that stoked creativity and also burned us and whether or not we agreed with him.\u00a0 A wry smile came to my face as the moderator asked this question.\u00a0 She had read Autism's Gadfly from time to time and that was how she had heard of me and wanted to invite me to be a panelist.\u00a0 I couldn't help wondering about the possibility that she had seen some of the scathing remarks I've leveled at Robison here from time to time and was trying to bait me.\u00a0 I tried to show some restraint, as I could easily get a bit carried away in any discussion about Mr. R or even a quote he had made.\u00a0 I stated that I did not agree with his quote and that autism was not a gift in most people but a horrible disability and 99.9% of us could not learn engineering without a college degree, start our own car repair business, get married three times, and write a best selling memoir.\u00a0 I again expressed skepticism of how Robison could possibly merit an autism diagnosis when he's stated that he no longer has any disability.\u00a0\n\nOverall, a good time was had by all.\u00a0 Though I did not completely agree with Melissa and Nate about a cure and neurodiversity, we established a rapport that evening and Nate expressed a desire to keep in touch with me.\u00a0\n\nI really detest traveling and flying on airplanes (particularly with the creation of the TSA in recent years) and that is one of the upsides of my lack of success as a writer and autism individual.\u00a0 However, success is a double edged sword.\u00a0 In order to get the word out, sell books, or whatever endeavor you want to do in the autism world, you have to travel, possibly all over the country or world, to become well-known.\u00a0 Temple Grandin, John Robison, and Steve Shore travel constantly to get their views out.\u00a0 So, I hope I will be afforded other opportunities like this in the future so I can get the word out about what a terrible movement neurodiversity is and that we need to do research to do things to help autistic people and eventually try to find a cure although that is not a realistic short term goal.\n\nI guess I can't count on too many opportunities like this in the foreseeable future, but I guess I'll have to wait and see what mysterious candy flavor comes up in Gump's metaphorical box.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sYTvi_Qj5XU/VtttsJtdHyI/AAAAAAAAAHU/tkHORc8q6Dk/s1600/melissa.jpg", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/757842605/aging-out-0", "http://blog.sfgate.com/lshumaker/2011/04/04/living-and-advocating-with-autism-nathaniel-majors-story/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2016/03/my-panel-participation-at-stanford.html", "title": "\nMy panel participation at Stanford \n"},
{"date": " May 31, 2016", "body": "\nWhen I first began writing this blog, I gave a response to an angry rant by one Michelle Dawson claiming that because I was opposed to neurodiversity-the idea that autism is a disorder and not a normal genetic variation or an alternative form of brain wiring-that I'm opposed to the idea of \"human rights\" for autistic people.\n\nRecently this phony baloney strawman issue has come to the fore again. \n\nThis was in response to an article written by a young woman on the autism spectrum who writes under the pen name of Gwendolyn Kansen.\u00a0 This article got a fair amount of traction on twitter and Facebook and recently appeared high in the google news search under \"autism\".\u00a0 Because Ms. Kansen's article made somewhat of an impact, some people in ND felt they should attack her.\u00a0 Though I don't agree with all of Ms. Kansen's article, she does make a few valid points.\u00a0 She gives a lot of examples of how autism can be extremely disabling and an intrinsic disorder, rather than something that can be accommodated for by society and cease to be disabling.\u00a0 For this reason, some individual in the neurodiversity movement who refuses to even sign an internet stage name has tried to refute Kansen's point, by repeatedly stating that this only means she opposes \"human rights\".\n\nI believe that all people (not just autistic people) have the right not to be discriminated against and treated with dignity.\u00a0 This does not mean that the American's with Disabilities act give those on the autism spectrum the right to behave however they please on a job, despite what Ari Ne'eman has stated about \"social architecture\" and overlooking social unpleasantries in the workplace.\n\nIn the case of McElwee the federal court of appeals ruled that overlooking autism when the individual who behaves badly on the job and makes untoward advances to women is not a reasonable accommodation under the ADA.\u00a0 \n\nNor can someone just ask for understanding on the job and expect to be accommodated when they are ill-suited for the profession.\n\nIn the case of wandering, it is not a violation of an individuals rights to protect them from drowning or being run over by a car as various members of the neurodiversity movement have suggested.\u00a0 Parents have a right to place their child under a conservatorship if they can't take care of themselves.\u00a0 It would be a violation of their right to be alive if they were not protected from wandering in spite of Neurodiversity's unsuccessful attempt to eliminate the wandering codes some years ago. \n\nI do agree that children have the right not be shocked at the Judge Rottenberg center though I suppose it's still legal in that state, though illegal in california where I live to do that.\u00a0 Hopefully the FDA or state legislatures elsewhere will take care of that.\n\nThough I can't argue about the strawman the author repeatedly says of Gwen Kansen (and others myself included) wanting to deliberately violate the rights of autistic people, let's examine some of the points they make. \n\nBecause Kansen and others point out that many autistic people have IQ's below 70, she does not mean that they don't have human rights, only that neurodiversity is violating their right, by speaking for them on the subject of a cure or other autism-related issues when they are ill-suited to do so due to having an intellectual disability.\u00a0 So if anyone is the human rights abusers it's ND. \n\nWhen Kansen writes about experiences she had with a bad boyfriend, she is not saying she is opposed to human rights, but only that autism has issues that are intrinsic to itself that can't be accommodated for. \n\nThe police did not have the right to \"summarily execute\" Kayden Clarke, but if he really did try to attack them with a knife, they did have a right to shoot him to save their own lives.\u00a0 If this is what really happened, then it's not a \"human rights\" violation as the author states. \n\nKansen also points out the case of Sky Walker, who was so severely disabled by his autism, he killed his own mother, but then the author of the rebutting article just turns this around and mentions the red herring of the disabilities mourning list of all the autistic people who were killed by others stating that she and I are opposed to autistics having the right not to be killed by their caretakers.\u00a0 Only a member of the ND movement would be capable of this sort of sophistry. \n\nI won't go into the other specific points, but this article again sums it up linking to another article stating that all of these problems autistics have could be solved if they are accommodated for and their \"human rights\" were not violated.\u00a0 I'm still waiting for the neurodiversity movement to be more specific about how i'm opposed to human rights, or more importantly to state how and why autistics could be accommodated for and how this would solve all of the problems and challenges that autistics have, as Ari Ne'eman, and other members of ND, including someone the author links to in their articles states that autism is only a disability because it has not been properly accommodated for and it would cease to be a disabling condition if this would happen. \n\nHowever, what about my human rights.\u00a0 Do I have the right not to be called all manner of names like \"asshole\", \"butt wipe\"\u00a0 \"turdball\" because I disagree with them publicly.\u00a0 Do I have the right not to have them write libelous statements about me, make fun of my disability and state that I would choose to have this handicap because all or most autistics want to remain autistic.\u00a0 Or stating that I'm like a jew who sympathized with the nazis during the holocaust.\u00a0 Or calling my mother bad names or stating that she's a threat to the autism community as one individual commented on Newsweek's site after they published an article profiling me. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nBefore neurodiversity uses the strawman of \"human rights\" again, I feel they should do a better job of respecting mine. \u00a0 \n\n\n",

{"date": " April 4, 2016", "body": "\nASAN has recently posted their 2014 tax return.\u00a0 Though ASAN started in 2006, they were not granted 501(c) tax exempt status until 2011.\u00a0 On reviewing their 2011 return we see that Ne'eman paid himself a salary of $40,000 a year for running ASAN.\n\nIn 2012 Ne'eman raised his own salary to $65,000 a year, a 62% increase, while the organization's revenues increased by only about half that percent.\u00a0 Interestingly enough, one of ASAN's and neurodiversity's talking points against autism speaks was the high compensation that some of the executives at AS received.\u00a0 In 2010, Autism Speaks' then president Mark Roithmayr was paid a salary of $400,000.\u00a0 He in fact had a five year contract for two million dollars.\u00a0 Neurodiversity and ASAN in particular made autism speaks out to be a bunch of greedy pigs who were taking money from the autism community by paying their president so generously.\u00a0 However, one has to look at the bigger picture.\u00a0 Roithmayr was paid $400,000 a year in 2010 out of more than 50 million dollars in revenue.\u00a0 In 2012, Ari Ne'eman was paid $65,000 a year out of about $375,000 in revenue.\u00a0 This means that Ne'eman's salary was nearly twenty times higher than Roithmayr's in ratio. \n\nIn 2013, Ne'eman's salary was $71,000 a year, though a more modest increase, it was still more than 10% in one year. \n\nAccording to the latest 2014 figures, neurodiversity has still been as profitable for Ne'eman as ever as his annual salary was $80,000 or $83,588.00 including all of his compensation. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThis means that his salary more than doubled in four years (or maybe technically less time than that).\u00a0 He's received an average annual salary increase of more than 25% a year since ASAN was granted non-profit status by the IRS.\n\nIn 2012, proportionately Ne'eman's most profitable year, about 17% of ASAN's revenues went to pay his salary alone.\u00a0 In 2014, ASAN's revenue was $765,282.00, so even though a lower proportion went to pay his salary in 2014, it was still more than 10% of the organization's total revenue.\u00a0 \n\nIf you look at one of their two accomplishments in terms of what the organization has done, trying to provide better health care options for autistics, you see that less money was spent on that than on Ne'eman's salary.\n\nOn public advocacy, they spent more than $360,000.\u00a0 I wonder if this includes airfare tickets to various autism speaks walks where it is known certain ASAN supporters go to harass parents who are trying to raise money to help their kids.\n\nWe see that more than a third of ASAN's revenue in 2014 was spent on employee salaries and other compensation.\n\nAre Autism Speaks the only ogres who are ripping off the autism community or is there a certain pot calling the kettle black?\n\nI wonder when congress will get some common sense and change the laws that make it so easy for people to start a charitable organization and get nonprofit status from the IRS and give themselves such huge compensation rather than helping those in need. \u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2014-990-ASAN.pdf"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2016/04/asans-2014-tax-forms-out-ari-neemans.html", "title": "\nASAN's 2014 tax forms out:  Ari Ne'eman's salary more than doubles in less than four years \n"},

when Bernard Rimland and Ruth Christ Sullivan decided that an advocacy organization was needed.\n\nI joined up with them in the early nineties, well before neurodiversity was invented or before almost anyone in the united states had even heard of Hans Asperger and there was such as thing as \"Asperger's Syndrome\".\u00a0 I went to one of their picnics and a couple of their board meetings that were open to the general public.\u00a0 I spoke on a panel in the very early nineties right around the time operation desert storm started in Iraq.\u00a0 There was a good thing about being involved in this organization and being able to go to some autism related meetings.\u00a0 I met my friend Jerry Newport shortly after that, after he'd seen Rainman and decided he was similar to a real life Raymond Babbit with his mathematical savant skills.\u00a0 In those days, autism organizations were dominated by parents and Jerry and I would be the only ones on the spectrum who attended the meetings.\u00a0 This made me feel a bit awkward, but the parents were always interested in my perspective.\n\nNot long after this, Jerry, some other people, and myself formed AGUA (Adult Gathering United Autistic) in 1993, an organization for autistic people to meet monthly and socialize--probably the first group of its kind ever.\u00a0 This organization would provide the inspiration for the group RASCAL in my novel, the Mu Rhythm Bluff.\u00a0 More significantly, the group provided the inspiration for the movie Mozart and the Whale.\u00a0 I went to some of ASA's conferences and met some nice people and had a few good times there.\u00a0 I would read their newsletter, The Advocate, when it came out.\u00a0 So to this day, I have some nice memories of ASA. \n\nAnother good thing about ASA was they included autistic voices in their perspectives.\u00a0 Temple Grandin served on the board of directors.\u00a0 She was followed by old school advocate Tom Mckean who disagreed with neurodiversity and favored a cure for autism.\u00a0 Some years later, when Stephen Shore arrived on the scene and began his ascent as conference mega superstar, he became a board member also.\u00a0 This made them immune to neurodiversity's hate mongering complaint that they've repeatedly leveled against autism speaks about there being no autistic board members prior to Robison's appointment to their science committee and Steve Shore and Valerie Paradiz's appointment to the board of directors. \u00a0 \n\nAs neurodiversity's tentacles and influence began to get a footing in the autism world, all that would begin to change.\u00a0 Red flags waved as the Autism Society of America endorsed Ari Ne'eman's appointment to the National Council on Disabilities, despite protests from The Age of Autism folks, Jon Shestack, and others like myself who loathed neurodiversity.\n\nNext they had Alex Plank as a keynote speaker at their annual conference.\u00a0 This is an individual who has stated that autism is a good thing.\u00a0 He bans anyone who disagrees with neurodiversity or levels any sort of criticism of him from his website, Wrongplanet.net.\u00a0 Even worse, when one of the members of Wrongplanet, William Freund, threatened to murder people, Plank did not report this to the authorities.\u00a0 Freund carried out his threat and murdered two innocent people before committing suicide.\u00a0 Another member of wrongplanet, Hans Petersen, murdered his dermatologist.\u00a0 Even though the relatives of the people Freund killed sued Plank, another member of wrongplanet threatened to go out and murder people with a gun and Plank did not delete the post and this person remains a member of WP in good standing.\u00a0 When I emailed Plank asking him to report this person to the authorities, my query was unanswered.\u00a0 I contacted the FBI and only then did Wrong Planet delete this person's post.\n\nAs you can see from the above screenshot photo, they're having their 2016 annual conference in New Orleans this summer and their keynote speaker is none other than the great Steve Silberman.\u00a0 The individual who stated that an autistic brain compared to a non-autistic brain was no more broken or different than a computer that had linux as its operating system rather than Windows.\u00a0 The man who stated that disability is part of the human experience and that we all became diaper wearers, so it was no big deal that some severely autistic children are incontinent.\n\nSilberman is to be accompanied by a panel of autistic people for a discussion accompanied by his keynote speech.\u00a0 I wonder what sort of autistics these people will be.\u00a0 Will they be people like Landon Bryce who admit they are self-diagnosed yet say autism should not be cured and that people who support autism speaks and a cure are eugenicists?\u00a0 Will they be people like Nick Walker who states the same thing but is completely functional and is able to work and get married and support a wife and a child?\u00a0 Or will they be people like Roger Kulp, who's intelligence is intact and verbal, yet who have suffered tremendously from their autism and want to let the world know so that we can pursue treatments and maybe *gasp* even a cure?\u00a0 My guess it will be more likely the former rather than the latter.\n\nApparently it is about the bottom line and almighty $$$$.\u00a0 Silberman's book made the NY Times Bestseller list and he's still widely known in the autism world and they apparently want money in their organization rather than doing the right thing. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nI believe an autism society should not support neurodiversity.\u00a0 They should say\u00a0 someday we hope we can have a cure and treatments for this disease and it will be a thing of the past.\u00a0 Someday we hope there won't be a need for conferences like this.\u00a0 That autism will no longer exist and defenseless children will no longer be crippled and sick.\n\nI suggest people boycott the conference this year or boycott ASA until they get their act together and stop supporting neurodiversity.\u00a0 Or, at the very least, walk out of the auditorium as Silberman and his merry band of mischief makers who claim to be autistic start giving their spiel.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links":

{"date": " January 7, 2016", "body": "\nA couple of days ago, the democratic party's leading contender, Hillary Clinton, announced a sweeping range of policy recommendations for autism spectrum disorders she says she'll attempt to implement if she's elected to the white house.\u00a0 She apparently had a conference call with Ari Ne'eman and a variety of other people.\u00a0 Interestingly enough, many of these recommendations reflect issues that Ne'eman's organization, ASAN, has tried to implement.\u00a0 I'd like to touch upon some of them. \n\nShe recommends a study to assess autism prevalence in adults similar to what the CDC does for eight-year-old children every two years under the Autism and developmentally disabilities monitoring network which was passed when the CARES act was still the combating autism act.\u00a0 The ADDM spends millions of dollars a year to produce these prevalence findings.\u00a0 They track areas, just in specified areas of the country and not the entire country.\u00a0 Why these specific areas are chosen is unclear.\u00a0 Every two years they track different counties and cities within the same state and often change the geographical areas, so the prevalence figures have little value.\u00a0 Also, it is unclear to Gadfly how the CDC prevalence monitoring helps any autistic children achieve better educational goals or occupational goals when they become adults.\u00a0 How are all these people served by the millions that is spent on these prevalence studies?\u00a0 The cost is particularly sensitive in that the majority of autistic can't work, can't get on disability and are either supported by their parents or live in abject poverty. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThe CDC searches special education schools and clinics where eight-year-old children are likely to present.\u00a0 They won't have this luxury in adults which makes studying the adult prevalence so much more difficult.\u00a0 Contrary to what the age of autism people and others who believe there's an autism epidemic that just happened in recent years in younger persons, this is the likely reason similar prevalence numbers haven't been found in older people.\u00a0 Or perhaps she wants to do something like the Brugha study whose methodology\u00a0was highly questionable.\u00a0 It was based on a modified version of Baron-Cohen's autism quotient survey which turned out to be a poor screen for autism.\u00a0 They then found only 19 people and on that made an \"educated guess\" that 1% of the entire adult British population had an autism spectrum disorder.\u00a0 Not to mention the fact that this screening tool is only designed for higher functioning autistics and not ones who are nonverbal or have an intellectual disability.\u00a0 Finding adult autism prevalence in adults is really like looking for a needle in a haystack.\u00a0 I don't believe it is money well spent when many autistics live in poverty and there's a shortage of funding for general services that help parents care for their autistic children. \n\nHillary Clinton wants to help find jobs for autistic people vis a vis legislation such as the American Disabilities Act and transition plans and the demonstration programs for which legislation has already been introduced by some members of congress.\u00a0 However, she neglects to mention how autistic people who are disabled by their condition would be amenable to be trained for various occupations to make them more employable.\u00a0 Even if taxpayer or private money were available, how could it be implemented.\u00a0 Most autistic people would have difficulty with schooling or learning a trade due to their disability.\u00a0 Of course, Clinton takes a card out of Laurent Mottron's bag of tricks, claiming they have all these talents and abilities that will make them marketable to employers while neglecting to cite any references or proof. \n\nThe Americans with Disabilities act only requires employers to give Reasonable accommodations to disabled employees.\u00a0 Tolerating tantruming, meltdowns and disruptive behavior that would occur at a job by a variety of autistic people are not reasonable accommodations. \u00a0 in one case a medical resident stating that acceptance and understanding of his asperger's was a reasonable accommodation did not prevail in federal court.\u00a0 As was\u00a0 the case of a man with an ASD whose request for acceptance of his loud voice and asking customers personal questions.\u00a0\n\nHillary Clinton also wants to legislate bullying out of existence.\u00a0 That's never going to happen.\u00a0 There are always going to be kids who bully other kids.\u00a0 It's a shame, but there's no easy and simplistic way you're going to be able to stop it.\u00a0 Of course, I agree that rather than the autistic child being segregated from their peers because of bullying, that the bullies should be segregated and sent to a reform school where they're locked up for their misdeeds.\u00a0 Of course, there's no more chance of that ever happening as there is of a cure for autism being found in my lifetime.\u00a0 Of course Mrs. Clinton takes advice from ASAN, so I suppose she doesn't want to do anything about Clay Adams, Phil Gluyas, Marc Rosen, and other neurodiversity proponents who bully and harass and libel me over the internet.\u00a0 How dare she listen to any suggestions from Ari Ne'eman who accepted membership dues and donations from these people who helped pay his $71,000 salary in 2013. \u00a0 \n\nMuch to neurodiversity's chagrin, one of the things that Mrs. Clinton did recommend was continuing projects like Autism Speaks Mssng campaign to search for genes that might figure in the etiology of autism.\u00a0\n\nHowever, she fails to give policy recommendations on many fronts.\u00a0 What of autistic people who can't find mates?\u00a0 What does Mrs. Clinton plan to do about that?\u00a0 What about the fact that the vast majority of autistics who have a seriously compromised ability to work are denied disability.\u00a0 If they get it at all, they have a protracted court battle that goes on for years.\u00a0 Why won't she mention this?\u00a0\n\nWorst of all, she neglected to mention one word about autism prevention or ultimately finding a cure for autism.\u00a0 It would seem Mrs. Clinton is another politician who unfortunately has been influenced by neurodiversity advocates.\u00a0\n\nAutism is not a political or legislative problem.\u00a0 It is a developmental disability.\u00a0 We need scientific funding and not politics to help solve the problems of autism.\u00a0\n\nWill Mrs. Clinton's policy recommendations fly?\u00a0 Gadfly doesn't think so.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links":

{"date": " January 21, 2016", "body": "\nThe hot new autism book that has recently come out is In a Different Key by Caren Zucker\u00a0 and John Donvan.\u00a0 It has some similarities to Steve Silberman's neurotribes in that they both give a lengthy description of the history of autism.\u00a0 Where they differ is that the latter portrays the neurodiversity in a sympathetic light, while the former treats it with some disdain.\n\nAbout ten pages of this nearly 600 page tome are devoted to Ari Ne'eman.\u00a0 Ne'eman published a piece trying to refute what the authors have to say about him and the ND movement. \n\nHe starts off his diatribe by playing the murder card, one of neurodiversity's dirtiest tricks, claiming that Donvan and Zuckerberg on page 142 of their book tried to justify the murder of an autistic boy.\u00a0 They never justified his murder, only stating what the man's defense attorney gave as the rationale that he had killed the boy to put him out of his misery, followed by a distorted logic while profoundly depressed.\u00a0 His lawyer argued for a temporary insanity defense.\u00a0 The jury didn't buy it and he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.\u00a0 The authors then go on to quote a woman who wrote an article where she only said that the father was not acting out of selfishness as she believed the prosecuting attorney had implied, but had snapped, though she realized this murder could never be justified.\u00a0 At no time do the authors defend the murder.\u00a0 Of course, anyone interested can go to page 142 of the book and judge for themselves.\n\nNe'eman writes how parents can never understand autism first hand because they don't experience what their kids do.\u00a0 I'm very curious how Ne'eman has experienced autism, how it has debilitated him in any way.\u00a0 I realize he's stated that he's attended special education at various times for unclear reasons.\u00a0 That he was bullied for being different and would scratch his face out of frustration til it bled.\u00a0 He's also stated that he has a sensitivity to velvet textures, has a face recognition deficit, and in a recent blog post commented on a sensitivity to static from a microphone.\u00a0 Other than that, I have no idea how his autism spectrum disorder has disabled him in any way or how he can claim to relate to the experiences of having autism that I, Roger Kulp, and others have who are truly debilitated by their condition.\u00a0 He seems evasive when he's asked about this by reporters as Donvan and Zucker correctly stated in their book. \u00a0 \n\nNext Ne'eman writes: \u00a0\u00a0 And far from being about blaming parents, the neurodiversity movement is\n about shifting the conversation to the real needs of autistic people \u2014 \nto the benefit of parents and autistic children and adults alike.\n\nIn fact, neurodiversity has always been about blaming the parents, going back to Jim Sinclair's Don't Mourn for Us speech where he castigates parents for wishing that they did not have an autistic child.\u00a0 Not to mention Marc Rosen's calling my mother overbearing.\u00a0 Some of the nastiest members of ND have stated that the reason for my autistic disability is that I had a mother who taught me to hate myself and calling her a witch and a yapping shrew.\u00a0 Not to mention one individual's statement in the comments section of the Newsweek profile about me that one of the greatest threats to the autism community was my mother.\u00a0 As far as I know, all of these individuals are members in good standing at ASAN and their membership dues helped pay Ne'eman's $71,000 annual salary in 2013. \n \nNe'eman also disputes Zucker and Donvan's statement that neurodiversity argues that autism is not essentially a disability, though this is something he's repeatedly stated over the years.\n\nIn an NPR interview in 2008, Ne'eman stated:\u00a0 We're disabled by society, What disables us is, for instance, \nan education system that's only designed to meet the needs of one kind \nof student, or societal prejudices which say that autistic people will \nnever be able to live in a community.\n\nThough Ne'eman does not explicitly state here that autism is not a disability, most people would take this statement to believe that he's saying autism is not essentially a disability, because Ne'eman implies that with acceptance and the proper accommodations autism would cease to be a disabling condition.\n\nAs older time readers of Gadfly remember, Ne'eman's words from several years ago, which I published after he denied on Lisa Jo Rudy's blog that he'd ever said autism wasn't a disability:\n\n\u00a0We see the world in a different way than our neurotypical peers \n(neurotypical is a word in the autistic community meaning those of the \nmajority neurology). This does not imply a defect, but merely a \ndifference \u2014 one that we have just the same right to as those of a \ndifferent race, nationality or religion.The belief was that anyone \nsociety labeled \"disabled\" could only go so far. Sadly, these \nmisconceptions had the potential to become self-fulfilling prophecies. \nWhen the expectation is that people of a certain type can only reach so \nfar, they are not provided with the same challenges and opportunities \nthat educators give mainstreamed students....\nIn the last paragraph Ne'eman writes:\n\nWe should recognize what diversity of neurology has contributed to the human race and what it can bring to the future. Difference is not disability and someday, I hope, the world will recognize that those who think in different ways should be welcomed.\n\nA reasonable person reading these words would seem to get the idea that Ne'eman is stating that autism essentially\u00a0 is not a disability. \n \nWe can also go back further in time to a statement Ne'eman wrote some years ago about whether or not Asperger's (which he's been diagnosed with rather than autism per se) is a disability:\n\n\u00a0I happened to stumble upon your entry on a Yahoo Search for \nAsperger's and I'm glad I did. As a teen with Asperger's, I strongly \nsuggest you tell your son as soon as possible. The fact is he is \ndifferent. What's more, this is not a bad thing. Any individual who \naccomplishes anything is different. It's his right and his requirement \nto know who he is, and what makes him different from those around him. \nFurthermore,Asperger's Syndrome is hardly what one would think of as a disability.\n I recommend you take a look at Norm Ledgin's \"Diagnosing Jefferson\", a \nwonderful book that suggests that one of the founders of our nation had \nAsperger's. As I and the book can attest, it is not in spite of but \nbecause of the characteristics that set us apart from others that \n\"Aspies\", as the popular nickname goes, have the ability to do great \nthings.The day will come when Asperger's will be recognized for what it truly is: a difference, not a disability,\n and in many ways an advantage. I think you owe it to your son to talk \nto him about who he is and help him succeed as that person, not pretend \n(or worse yet, force him to pretend) to be someone else. I'm somewhat \nnotably successful for my age and as a result I've occasionally been \nasked to speak to newly diagnosed \"Aspies\" and at a few conferences \nabout Asperger's and special education in general. One of the things \nI've always tried to stress is the vital importance of recognizing the \nadvantages of difference and not falling into the trap so many do that \ndifferent is defective.\n\nI haven't bothered to provide the links, but I think the one to the last statement about Asperger's is still there and can be found in the blog post where I first posted this.\u00a0 ASAN deleted the article on their web page in which the difference is not disability statement appeared at the time I first blogged about it and the senate was still considering Ne'eman's appointment to the national council on disabilities.\n \nBased on these statements, I would certainly concur with Donvan and Zucker that Ne'eman has stated that autism is not essentially a disability and this has been his belief all along.\n\nAre autistic behaviors considered by some to be pathologic adaptive in nature?\u00a0 Ne'eman writes:\n\nMany unusual autistic behaviors are important and adaptive in nature. \nHand flapping, rocking, and other forms of stimming serve as important \nmeans of emotional and sensory regulation for autistic\u00a0\n\nchildren.\u00a0\n\nThese behaviors cause attention to be drawn to the individual resulting in bullying and discrimination in employment.\u00a0 While I agree that the bullying and discrimination should not exist, we still have to conform to society, so in that sense the behaviors are maladaptive.\u00a0 My twiddling (self stim) has made my life miserable.\u00a0 It prevents me from getting things done during the day and is incapacitating.\u00a0 It is due to a serious organic brain impairment and I wish something could be done about it. \n\nI don't know anything about the run-in that Ne'eman had with Peter and Elizabeth Bell except for what I read in In a Different Key and what Ne'eman wrote about it in this article.\u00a0 However, I only hold Pete Bell in disdain for advocating for funding of Alex Plank's and Cubby Robison's Autism Talk TV when he was an executive at autism speaks, even though his son will likely never function at the level of Ne'eman, Plank, or Robison junior.\u00a0 If the Bells are still unhappy with the neurodiversity movement, I see them as part of the problem rather than the solution.\u00a0 \n \nAs the neurodiversity movement becomes more prominent, I do see them as a threat toward advancement in the science and research that could lead to a greater understanding and treatments that could help mitigate if not cure autism at some future date.\u00a0 I've now read Donvan's and Zucker's book and I'm glad they question the neurodiversity movement and I hope more in the media will continue to do so, since not too many people read my piddling Gadfly blog where I've been trying to take them on for years. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vox.com/2016/1/21/10801846/autism-in-a-different-key"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2016/01/ari-neemans-hyperbolic-take-of-in.html", "title": "\nAri Ne'eman's hyperbolic take of In a different Key \n"},
{"date": " February 12, 2016", "body": "\nFor the past few days, I've been a fan of John Donvan and Caren Zucker.\u00a0 I read their book, \"In a Different Key\" with enthusiasm.\u00a0 One of the best books on autism I'd read in a long time.\u00a0 Last night, I saw them speak at UCLA.\u00a0 I briefly chatted with John Donvan who thanked me for coming to see him and was flattered when he told he that he'd read my blog on numerous occasions. \n\nHowever they've written a take on what politicians should say about the a word that I find disillusioning.\n\nThey spoke about Hillary Clinton's mindless parroting about issues she ain't got a clue about.\u00a0 I've\u00a0 written about this previously\n\nThey tell politicians to avoid the cure word and listen to what neurodiversity has to say.\u00a0 They claim that many autistic people are offended by this word.\u00a0 But Donvan and Zucker don't seem to care, that neurodiversity is in reality a vocal minority who silence the voices of the true majority of those on the spectrum who can't speak for themselves or write a blog post refuting ND nonsense.\u00a0 I remain an outspoken opponent of the neurodiversity movement.\u00a0 There is no reason at all to listen to anything these people have to say and I hope they won't.\u00a0 I don't believe that a small constituency should be listened to because it's the most expedient thing to do. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThough I believe it's okay for politicians to say the cure word and say we should work for a cure, that they should use it sparingly.\u00a0 A cure is not on the horizon in the foreseeable future.\u00a0 Just as Clinton promised pie-in-the-sky in her policy directives that she has no understanding of, politicians should not promise an easy cure either.\u00a0 I remember about eleven years ago, I was at an unlocking autism conference and a congressman said we'd work for a cure for autism and find it in our lifetime.\u00a0 This was not much better or as bad as what Clinton did.\u00a0 So politicians should not make easy promises on the things i'd like to have happen either.\n\nWhile politicians may listen to neurodiversity because of the Ne'eman's family power and influence and the bullies who take of advantage of autistic people and their families who may not be functional enough or have the time or resources to refute them, I don't think any rational politician would use the word 'celebrate' to describe autism either.\u00a0 So i'm not sure why Donvan and Zucker would admonish politicians not to use this term.\n\nI agree that the vaccine argument has likely been refuted. Not so long ago, I suspect a majority of parents whose children had been diagnosed with autism believed it was due to vaccines.\u00a0 That number is probably smaller now, but it's likely as sizable number as those who believe in the neurodiversity movement and no more on the fringe.\u00a0 So I'm disappointed that Donvan and Zucker would tell people to listen to the neurodiversity movement and not listen to those who believe vaccines cause autism. Though I don't agree with the vaccine causes autism people, I believe at least they have good intentions and want to help their kids, unlike the hate mongers and mentally ill people who believe in neurodiversity.\n\nDonald Trump has been a proponent of the idea of an autism epidemic and the possibility that vaccines cause autism.\u00a0 One individual I know who believes vaccines cause autism has stated they planned to vote for Trump because they felt he was the only candidate who would adequately address the vaccine question.\u00a0 Trump's position on an autism epidemic and the possibility of vaccines causing autism has certainly not hurt his poll numbers and the number of delegates he's received for the republican convention so far, so I don't think that Donvan and Zucker are correct about that.\u00a0 \n\nAs far as seeking common ground and discord in the autism community over political disputes, that is inevitable.\u00a0 I have no common ground with these individuals in the neurodiversity movement who have bullied me, insulted my mom, libeled me on the internet, and believe I should live my life as a cripple, even though most of them are higher functioning and less impaired than I am (and that's something considering I'm most likely on the milder end of the functioning level)\u00a0 Donvan and Zucker are dreaming if rifts within the community are going to just go away.\n\nThe only point on which I partially agree (aside from politicians using the word cure sparingly and not making pie-in-the-sky promises) is we should not forget about autistic adults.\u00a0 However, claiming there are easy solutions for housing and other programs when the country is in debt and tax dollars for resources is scarce is not realistic.\u00a0 Claiming that there is some easy way that an autistic person can be trained for a job and not have workplace programs is indeed a grandiose promise.\n\nOf course, one solution for helping provide services for autistic children would be to amend the CARES act, so the ADDM would be done away with.\u00a0 This program costs millions of dollars which could go to services for people rather than generating meaningless prevalence numbers that don't accomplish anything. \n\n\u00a0Not surprisingly, Donvan and Zucker also fail to discuss the issues of autistics being denied disability who can't work and the monthly disability checks not being enough for a church mouse to live on let alone a human being.\n\nUnlike Donvan and Zucker, I hope politicians who don't have a clue about autism will STFU to be blunt.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no reason for Hillary or anyone else to listen to anything ASAN or any other neurodiversity organizations have to say.\u00a0 There is no reason for her or any other politician to mindlessly parrot talking points they have no clue about.\n\nIn\u00a0 probably every election since John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were running for president, there's been too much pandering to the populace to obtain votes rather than advocating for the right thing, not just in autism, but in all public policy issues.\u00a0 I don't believe it's productive for these two authors to encourage this practice.\u00a0 Up until now, I was an enthusiastic fan of Donvan and Zucker, but their most recent Washington Post article is disappointing indeed.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/here-is-the-conversation-candidates-should-be-having-about-autism/2016/02/11/19d208b0-cb49-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2016/02/donvan-and-zuckers-bizarre-take-on.html", "title": "\nDonvan and Zucker's bizarre take on the politics of autism \n"},

{"date": " December 26, 2015", "body": "\nI see that one of my favorite autism writers is at it again, trivializing the fact that some children on the autism spectrum engage in self-injury and are incontinent.\u00a0 In this article, Steve Silberman was asked about one blogger who criticized his book, because he left out any descriptions of autistics who were \"head-bangers\" and \"diaper-wearers\"If the Forbes magazine reporter is not misquoting him he states:\n\n\u00a0\u201cIs this really how we want to describe our fellow human beings, no \nmatter how many serious challenges they have in daily life? If we live \nlong enough, we all become \u2018diaper wearers\u2019 eventually,\u201d Silberman said.\n \u201cDisability is a part of the human experience.\u201d\n\nSince Silberman seems to take umbrage to the words \"head-bangers\" and \"diaper-wearers\", i'll refrain from using those terms and just make the more polite factual statements that there are persons on the autism spectrum who self-mutilate themselves and who are incontinent.\u00a0 I don't know if Leo Rosa and Mark Rimland, apparently the only more severe cases of autism that Silberman has ever encountered, engage in self-injury or are incontinent, but there are in fact some autistic people for whom this is a fact of life.\u00a0 Though I have no recollection of this, I was told by my parents that as a toddler I'd sometimes bang my head into a wall out of frustration.\u00a0 Though I don't do this now, I think this was before the age of five and I have no memory of this. \n \nMost persons with an interest in autism have not been involved in it as long as I have, so they have no memory of when Ivar Lovaas and his disciples would give powerful electric shocks to children who did this and justify it, by saying that they were saving the kids from chewing their fingers off or banging their head into a wall so hard that they would receive serious injuries and stating that kids who had to experience the discomfort of wearing a straight jacket could have the freedom from the restraint.\u00a0 Mr. Silberman, I know you did research on Lovaas and wrote of the historical shameful period when aversives were used, so you should know better.\u00a0 Some children need to be in helmets so they won't get injured banging their heads into walls.\u00a0 But I suppose Silberman and the rest of the neurodiversity crowd would just argue this is a reasonable accommodation so the head banger is just fine as long as he/she wears a helmet.\u00a0 I wonder if this does not interfere with their sleep or how they'll shower and shampoo so they don't get lice or something in their hair because the parents/caretaker does not dare take the helmet off for fear that the child will get a serious injury.\u00a0\n\nWhile it's true, we all have to wear diapers as infants and early toddlers, there are plenty of people who never have to wear diapers after this, no matter how old they are, like my paternal grandmother who lived to 105.\u00a0\n\nI don't know how disability has ever been a part of Silberman's human experience, unless he believes that his homosexuality was some sort of social disability prior to 1974 before the american psychiatric association removed it from the DSM when he was seventeen.\u00a0\n\nMr. Silberman, if you ever happen to read this, I just want to say if the reporter was not misquoting you, shame on you for saying this,\u00a0 Shame on you for trivializing this horrible disability you have no experience with.\u00a0 I know in the past you told me to be careful of what I write as you did not name drop Zuckerman and Gates as autistic and that was mere speculation of a reporter that was interviewing, and I've done my best to heed your warning, but it sure looks to me like the reporter was asking you this and quoting you directly.\n\nIt's bad enough that you've stated that the reason autistics can't work is that human resource offices aren't used to nonverbal people and won't give them a communication device, that autism versus neurotypicality is no different from a windows versus linux operating system, and the fact that you've stated mark rimland does not need a cure for his autism because of the love and acceptance of the community he lives in.\u00a0 However, now, in my esteemed opinion, you've hit an all-time low and I just want to tell you I feel this statement of yours is absolutely despicable if the reporter was not misquoting you and you should be ashamed of yourself.\u00a0 This is another reason why everyone should boycott your book or any other book you write in the future in spite of the reporter saying we should buy it.\u00a0 shame on you!

The phrase that stands out most prominently to me in the article is this:\n\n\u00a0In recent years, researchers have \ndetermined that most cases of autism are not rooted in rare de novo \nmutations but in very old genes that are shared widely in the general \npopulation while being concentrated more in certain families than \nothers.\u00a0\n\nSince Silberman neglected to cite any source for this, I'm curious where he got this information since it completely contradicts everything that I've read about autism genetic research that's taken place in the last eight years or so. \n \n\nJonathan Sebat for instance has published research showing a significant association between autism and de novo mutations.\u00a0 Dr. Sebat states that he expects that the actual cases of de novo mutations is in reality substantially higher than what he found since the techniques for identifying these genetic abnormalities are still not advanced enough to find spontaneous mutations on the genome that might be even smaller than those already identified.\n\nA study done in Israel several years ago showed that children of fathers over the age of forty were nearly six times as likely to have an autism spectrum disorder than the offspring of younger fathers.\u00a0 It was considered probable that this was the result of de novo mutations in the sperm of the older dads.\u00a0 \n\nA very recent study done at Cold Harbor Springs lab has suggested that probably half of all cases of autism are caused by rare de novo mutations on genes that have a particular vulnerability and that these are not old genes as Silberman claims, but are expunged rapidly from the population since autistic people rarely have children.\u00a0 Previous research done by this group showed that some of these de novo mutations were carried by the mothers who had a protective effect against autism but their children (usually boys) inherited them in an autosomal dominant fashion. \n\nThis is just a small sampling of articles that suggest rare de novo mutations not found in the general population are a significant factor in autism spectrum disorders. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThe Slate article was apparently excerpted from the Neurotribes book.\u00a0 It's been a while since I've read neurotribes and I can't recall if Silberman wrote this in the book or if he gave any references to any actual genetic studies that support his statement.\u00a0\u00a0 Since there's been so much science that contradicts what he says, I'm wondering if this research exists, could Silberman or anyone else cite any references since I can't seem to find any on the internet.\u00a0 Maybe there's something out there, but it would seem that Silberman has made statements on the genetics of autism that have no factual basis as was the case with his statements on Kanner's work.\u00a0 Even if there were such research, Silberman would have to explain why he said what he said in light of\u00a0 recent research that has found that a significant number of autism cases are the result of de novo mutations. \u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/09/the_neurodiversity_movement_autism_is_a_minority_group_neurotribes_excerpt.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2993504/", "http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=668208", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150922150236.htm"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2016/01/where-does-silberman-get-his-info-on.html", "title": "\nWhere does Silberman get his info on autism genetic research?\n"},

I've written about Roger's background in a previous post so I won't repeat the info here.\n\nI guess wanting autism speaks to stop supporting neurodiversity in a backhanded manner and taking such a cavalier attitude toward those of us on the spectrum who want a cure is too much to hope for.\n\nAddendum:\u00a0 I've just spoken to Steve Shore and he states that he's had a change of heart because Brian Kelly, the new chairman of the AS board is advocating for supports and services over a cure.\u00a0 Mr. Kelly took over as chairman of the board after Bob Wright resigned in May.\u00a0 Mr. Kelly\u00a0 has written about parents contacting him for the need for supports and services.\u00a0 Though I am not opposed to supports and services for people on the autism spectrum, I do believe that autism speaks should give more priority to scientific research with the aim of curing autism.\u00a0 If autism speaks has headed in a new direction, this is certainly a disappointment. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.autismspeaks.org/news/news-item/autism-speaks-welcomes-three-new-board-members", "https://www.autismspeaks.org/news/news-item/autism-speaks-co-founder-bob-wright-step-down-chairman"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2015/12/autism-speaks-appoints-autistic-board.html", "title": "\nAutism speaks appoints autistic board members, pro-cure autists again scorned. \n"},
{"date": " October 12, 2015", "body": "\nThe mass shooting in Oregon by Chris Harper Mercer and his mother's publicly writing about his autism diagnosis have stirred controversy in the autism community as to whether or not his autism was responsible for the mass murder of innocent people.\u00a0 A facebook page was created implying that numerous autistic people were shooters and that autism is associated with violent crime and murder.\u00a0 After a plethora of protests and petitions, Facebook removed the page.\u00a0 In response, there were a flurry of articles published on the internet by a list of authors that reads like a who's who list of some of the most prominent members of the neurodiversity movement, including Michael John Carley, Emily Willingham and the Autistic Self Advocacy Network and Matt Carey of the Left Brain Right Brain blog.\u00a0\u00a0 The common theme of these articles is that there is no association whatsoever between autism and violence. \n\nRenowned writer Andrew Solomon also weighed in, writing in a new york times article about autism shooters, asking why no one was suggesting diabetes and pattern baldness as causes of mass shootings if they were suggesting autism was one.\u00a0 See Gadfly's answer toward the end of the post. \u00a0 \n\nThis is nothing new.\u00a0 The Newgate shootings of Adam Lanza less than three years ago are still fresh in the minds of most people, particularly Lanza's diagnosis of Asperger's.\u00a0 Well-known neurodiversity advocate John Elder Robison was quick to write a response absolving autism for blaming murderous behavior.\u00a0 The IACC, which has had several members of the neurodiversity movement (and zero pro-cure autistics) serving on it since its inception also wrote an article disputing the association between autism and violence after the Lanza shootings. \n\nAside from the fact that all of these writers advocate neurodiversity, another common denominator in all these pieces is the nearly complete neglect to cite any scientific evidence that there is absolutely no association between autism and violent crime.\u00a0 The trivial exception to that being Carey's citing a study by\u00a0 Ghaziuddin and the studies by Mouridsen in Denmark purporting not to show an association between autism and violence.\u00a0 These were the three publications cited by the IACC's statement on the Sandyhook shooting.\n\nWhat does the actual literature show?\u00a0 One of the problems of Ghaziuddin's report was that he only did literature reviews of isolated cases and neglected to check court records to ascertain the relationship between autism and violence.\u00a0 This is an old paper nearly twenty-five years old.\u00a0 What do other more recent publications have to say? Only the abstract of Mouridsen's 2012 paper is available online and I have not been able to read the entire paper.\u00a0 One limitation of his 2008 paper is that it only includes convictions and not arrest data such as cases of people on the spectrum that were thrown out for lack of evidence, let alone killers who committed suicide.\n\nAre these writers correct that there is no general association between autism and violent crime, particularly murder?\u00a0 The short answer is probably yes, though it is still questionable (at least to Gadfly) how much is known about the prevalence of violence in autism spectrum disorders.\n\nHowever, even if there is no clear-cut association between autism and violence and the vast majority of autistic persons are not prone to violence, particularly murder, could there be a subset of those on the spectrum who are predisposed to violence and murder as a result of their brain dysfunction, including co-morbid mental conditions that appear in addition to the symptoms of the ASD?\u00a0 The answer to this question appears to be yes also.\n\nVarious case studies have been reported in the literature that gives suggestive evidence (though not specific proof of this).\u00a0 For example Baron-Cohen reported on a 21-year-old man who would take a knife to his 71-year-old girlfriend.\u00a0 Psychiatrist Donna Schwartz-Watts cites three case histories of individuals on the spectrum who committed murder.\u00a0 She concludes their illness was in fact related to their crimes.\u00a0 Newman and Ghaziuddin(author of the original 1991 study concluding there was no relationship between ASD's and crime), in the journal of autism and developmental disorders, stated that there was a relationship between some forms of autism with premorbid psychiatric conditions and certain violent crimes (I have not read this article, but the reports on it).\n\nPsychologist Matt Lerner writes about how theory of mind, impulsivity and other problems may in fact be related to violent crime in some (emphasis added) autistic individuals.\n\nThough the research in this area may have its limitations and not come to any definite conclusions, it would suggest that there is a small subset of persons on the autism spectrum who are predisposed to violent acts, including mass murder.\u00a0 Part of the reason for this may be comorbid psychiatric conditions such as schizoaffective disorder, depression, bipolar, and other things that accompany some of the many forms of autism.\n\nTo answer Andrew Solomon's question.\u00a0 Diabetes and pattern baldness are not brain conditions that affect behavior, autism is.\u00a0 There is no comorbidity with mental disorders documented in diabetes and pattern baldness the way there has been in autism.\u00a0 It's another neurodiversity comparison between apples and hurricanes. \u00a0 \n\nThe neurodiversity movement often try to separate comorbidity from autism, saying that the seizure disorders that accompany autism are separate from the autism itself.\u00a0 We should just regard this as epilepsy and not part of the individual's autism.\u00a0 Even if the research proves that some mass murderers have a form of autism with comorbidities, they will state that it is these comorbidities that are the culprit and not the autism per se.\u00a0 However, I believe when epilepsy and comorbidities exist they are all a part of one brain disorder with the autism being one symptom.\u00a0 I don't believe you can separate one from another.\u00a0 They are all part and parcel for the course.\u00a0 Therefore, I suspect it is likely that in a small number of cases (though not the vast majority) there is an association between murder and autism.\u00a0 I concede that further research may have to be done to completely validate that conclusion.\u00a0 However, I don't think it is helpful for members of the ND movement and others to claim there is no association whatsoever between autism and murder when at least some scientific evidence would seem to contradict them.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://journal.9med.net/html/qikan/sjbxyjsbx/mgjsbxyflxb/20059333/20080831180305745_214051.html", "http://www.jaapl.org/content/40/2/177.full"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2015/10/are-neurodiversiy-bloggers-giving.html", "title": "\nAre neurodiversity bloggers giving an accurate description of the association between autism and violence?\n"},

{"date": " November 27, 2013", "body": "\nI see that the Autistic Self Advocacy Network is at it again.\u00a0 They have recently written a letter urging sponsors of Autism Speaks to withdraw their support of the organization they loathe so much.\u00a0 \n\nTo support their position they use the same old and tired talking points that we've heard from them ad nauseum and not coming up with any new ones.\u00a0 For any of the uninitiated who happens to read this and\u00a0are far less jaded than myself, I'll briefly recap:\u00a0 \n\nAutism Speaks has no members of the autism spectrum on the advisory boards or in positions of power to influence their policy.\u00a0 Now that John Elder Robison has resigned from the science and treatment advisory boards, they are reemphasizing this point as Gadfly predicted they would.\nAutism Speaks primarily funds scientific research and only\u00a0spends\u00a04%\u00a0of their budget on \"community services\" (whatever this nebulous term means) \nAutism speaks engages in fund raising using offensive rhetoric.\u00a0\nAutism speaks somehow(I don't understand how) takes money away from communities with their fund raising drives\u00a0that could go to other things that ASAN regards as more useful than the stuff that Autism Speaks already spends money on.\n\nI've\u00a0previously discussed the issue that Autism Speaks' supporters are primarily parents\u00a0who are looking for help for their minor children and parents make decisions for their children and the fact that the 96% of funding on scientific research is a goal consistent with Autism Speaks' stated philosophy and that of their predecessor organizations, Cure Autism Now and the National Alliance of Autism Research.\u00a0 I'd like to address some\u00a0more specific points in this post.\n\nASAN implies that Autism Speaks holds a gun to people and forces them to give them money. and if they stopped doing this, then the communities would have more money for these vague services and objectives and Autism Speaks would have less money that is not being usefully spent.\u00a0 I don't understand this as Autism speaks is not the government and does not have the power to tax people.\u00a0 Their donations are only done on a voluntary basis.\u00a0 No one in these communities who feels money is being taken away from them has to give AS a dime.\u00a0 \n\nASAN has invoked their fellow ND, John Elder Robison's name in this protest letter.\u00a0 Interestingly enough John Robison has chastised me for what he called my unrelenting negativity and not proposing positive solutions to help persons with autism and their families.\u00a0 Isn't ASAN now doing the same thing Robison accused me of and isn't it ironic they are invoking his name in this letter?\u00a0 \n\nIf 100% of Autism Speaks capital (aside from administrative costs) should\u00a0be spent on \"community services\", then what\u00a0exactly are these services, how should they be funded and how can ASAN (or anyone else who wants them) make their case to the public that they should be funded and has ASAN adequately done this?\u00a0 I believe the answer is no.\u00a0 They have claimed\u00a0(at least\u00a0at one time) that autism wouldn't even be a disability if it were adequately accommodated.\u00a0 That if these accommodations were provided for, autism would go from being a disability to a mere \"difference\".\u00a0 Yet they have been thoroughly vague (at least in my opinion) as to how this can be accomplished.\u00a0 How the services they want to spend\u00a0money would do this and why we would have no need for scientific research to find treatments or a cure.\u00a0 \n\nASAN has every right to conduct walks and fundraisers to help raise money for these community services\u00a0\u00a0In this country where we have the free enterprise system, there is no reason they could not raise the millions that Autism speaks has if they could show compelling evidence that these were more beneficial.\u00a0 \nOther than their internship with Freddie Mac program, I don't see any evidence they have ever done this.\u00a0 They only want to tear down Autism Speaks and people who want a cure for autism\u00a0rather than offering their own constructive solutions and\u00a0raising the\u00a0needed capital and stating how autistic people can be helped.\u00a0 \n\nThey have succeeded to a large degree of the government hearing their voices.\u00a0 To date, they have four seats on the IACC as compared to the anti-vax movement's one seat and the zero seats held by pro-cure autistics since the IACC's inception.\u00a0 However, the IACC is largely window dressing and, for this reason, they\u00a0 haven't been able to get much accomplished by serving there.\u00a0 \n\nSo far\u00a0they have only seemed to want to take over Autism Speaks and their hard earned capital by infiltration.\u00a0 They have succeeded to a\u00a0degree by getting Robison in their organization and the\u00a0nearly half million dollar grant acquired by Laurent Mottron and company.\u00a0 The likely reason for this is due to their own ineptitude in acquiring this capital themselves.\u00a0 Another reason is that most of the people who donate money are parents of children who want a cure for their children and don't ascribe to ASAN's POV.\u00a0 There aren't enough people with sufficient\u00a0funds who would donate money to ASAN so they could accomplish these lofty goals.\u00a0 \n\nIn the same vein of Robison's words, I suggest instead of trying to tear down people they don't like that ASAN engage in constructive solutions such as being more specific about how autistic people can be helped, how they can be accommodated and how these accommodations could eliminate any need for biomedical research or a cure.\u00a0 They could do fundraising walks, give benefits and raise the capital in the same manner that other charities do.\u00a0 I won't hold my breath though.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticadvocacy.org/2014/01/2013-joint-letter-to-the-sponsors-of-autism-speaks/"], "link":

Facebook has since deleted this page.  If this page happened to start right after the Lanza shootings or before, Durbin-Westby does not mention this.\n\nI'm not sure who (if anybody) diagnosed Lanza with Asperger's but from various reports from his brother, friends of his mother and his parents' divorce records, there is credible evidence that Lanza was in fact diagnosed with Asperger's by a legitimate clinician.\u00a0 This is unlike the case of Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, Stephen Spielberg--those paragons of virtue from the point of view of the neurodiversity movement that cause them to state that it's okay to be autistic and no cure is needed or in fact would be a bad thing.\u00a0 Larry Arnold, my old friend from the ND movement, has stated on my facebook page that Lanza was in fact never diagnosed with Asperger's and it's all speculation.\u00a0 I'm waiting for Larry to come up with some documentation for that with bated breath.\u00a0 Once again, I'm appalled that neurodiversity does not want to take the bad with the good.\u00a0 They can have their cake and eat it too by claiming autism is a gift because all of these celebrities allegedly had it, but they don't want to include people like Adam Lanza or George Sodini in\u00a0 their brethren. I've written about this elsewhere also\u00a0 \n\nNo, I don't think one kid teasing another kid and some wingnuts who can easily log onto facebook represent credible sources.  \n\nAre these people who are proclaiming there is no link between autism and violence actually responding to someone or is this just hysterics in light of the tragic event and the possibly irrational fear that because Lanza allegedly had Asperger's this will give all people (myself included) with an autism spectrum disorder a \"bum rap\".\u00a0 If there is anyone (I mean credible person) in the media or elsewhere who has attempted to link autism and violence or claim that Lanza's Asperger's caused these kids to be killed before these people disavowed a link between autism and violence, I'd be interested in hearing about it.\n\nIn the meantime, I guess we can paraphrase that old saw from the NRA and say that autism doesn't murder people.\u00a0 People murder people.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nbc12.com/story/20386590/woman-with-aspergers-defends-the-condition#.UNMexT-8KTA.facebook"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/12/whos-claiming-theres-link-between.html", "title": "\nWho's claiming there's a link between autism and violence?\n"},
{"date": " January 20, 2013", "body": "\nI'm happy to report that the neuroscientist Dr. Manuel Casanova, who's done research involving minicolumns in the post mortem brains of autistic persons has has recently started a new blog  called cortical chauvinism, which should be some interesting stuff about neuroscience, particularly the neuroscience of autism.  The good doctor's first entry deals with the problems of extrapolating mice models of autism to humans, since the brains of the two species are so different.  Dr. Casanova has found that a unit of the brain called minicolumns-a vertical structure that contains 80 to 100 neurons working together- are more numerous in the postmortem autistic brains that he studied and also have less neurons in them and are narrower than in typical control brains.  He also found the insulation of the autistic minicolumns was not as well developed as in typical brains.  He has used the analogy of a broken shower curtain which means that certain neurotransmitters such as GABA can get through, abnormally exciting the neurons.  Interestingly, he found these in the prefrontal cortex, an area that Eric Courchesne found to be abnormally enlarged and have an abnormal number of neurons in some autistic brains.  Also these are part of the mirror neuron system that Dr. Marco Iacoboni has described.  He and other researchers have found abnormalities of these type of neurons in the autistic brains on functional MRIs.  \n\nCourchesne seemed to think that one of the problems of Casanova's research was that all of the postmortem brains were those of adults rather than small children.  Since the autistic brain undergoes developmental changes throughout the lifetime, this could limit the minicolumn findings.  Of course, there are a dearth of toddlers brains available for postmortem autopsy.  \n\nI asked Dr.Iacoboni if mirror neurons could exist on minicolumns, i.e. whether or not you could have a minicolumn with 60 to 80 mirror neurons on it.  He replied that we didn't know but probably not.  \n\nSo apparently, there are a lot more questions than answers.  \n\nThough some of the science on this new blog post and future posts that Dr. Casanova may write may be a bit out of my depth, I still find this a really intriguing new blog and I hope Dr. Casanova continues to write posts.  \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://corticalchauvinism.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2013/01/cool-new-blog-by-dr-manuel-casanova.html", "title": "\ncool new blog by Dr. Manuel Casanova \n"},

{"date": " January 23, 2013", "body": "\nI've just read an interesting article in that ironically named blog, The thinking person's guide to autism,\u00a0 that seems to stick up for the neurodiversity movement, which claims to be about human rights, but also states that autism is not a disordered way of being but a different way of being and whose numerous proponents have even stated on occasion that autism is not a disability.\n\nHer article is in response to  a piece written by Amy Lutz, questioning how well facilitated communication works as well as how much the neurodiversity movement truly represents autistic people.\u00a0 Most of Lutz's article is nothing new for those denizens of autism blogs who know well the arguments against neurodiversity and the story of Amanda Bagg's questionable if not improbable status as a true member of the autism spectrum.\u00a0 Ergo, the details of the article are not worth repeating here, though the interested reader can read the article I've linked to.\n\nMs. Rosa questions the reasons that Lutz would attack the ND movement.\u00a0 Conversely, I'd like to ponder the question of why the author defends the neurodiversity movement.\u00a0 Accordingly, I'd like to come up with what I think may be a plausible explanation for her behavior.\n\nDes Roches Rosa claims that Lutz was attacking disabled people for appearing less disabled than her offspring.\u00a0 This did not seem to be the case.\u00a0 Though she did not dispute that Amanda Baggs may be disabled, she points out Baggs unusual clinical history for an autism diagnosis and the questionable claim she was diagnosed with autism at age 14.\u00a0 This is certainly a legitimate talking point as Baggs, at least in the past, was a poster child for the ND movement.\u00a0 Also, she gives Ari Ne'eman as an example of one of these disabled persons.\u00a0 This is in spite of the fact that in the past i've documented that Ne'man has stated that he himself is not disabled.\u00a0 So I'm not sure who the author is referring to as disabled.\n\nMost interesting of all, she states that neurodiversity is not only the province of very high functioning (or not even disabled) autistics/Asperger's individuals, but for parents of relatively low functioning children as well.\u00a0 She gives herself and Kristina Chew as examples.\n\nThough I don't know a whole lot about Ms. Rosa, I am quite familiar with Ms. Chew, as I've read numerous blog entries of hers and have seen her on Good Morning America.\u00a0 This is a woman who has stated she opposes curing her son's autism, yet has placed him in ABA programs with the apparent goal of \"normalizing\" him.\u00a0 She has advocated for the IDEA law and has advocated for services on his behalf and seems to have a misunderstanding of the law's intent and the supreme court's decision in the Rowley case and insists her son receive the \"best\" services, though he is not legally entitled to these.\u00a0 She has also made the strangely inconsistent statement to me that she is satisfied with her son's functioning level.\u00a0 Not only does one wonder about an explanation for Rosa's defense of ND in general, but Ms. Chew's behavior in particular.\n\nAs a former consumer of psychoanalysis for more than ten years in my childhood, I believe I have the answer to these intriguing questions---Freudian defense mechanisms.\u00a0 These include reaction formation, denial, projection, etc.\u00a0 though I've written about this topic in the past, I believe a recap is in order.\n\nThe first of these defense mechanisms is denial.\u00a0 Diane Sawyer in the Good Morning America show that Ms. Chew was on aptly described neurodiversity as a beautiful way of justifying heartbreak.\u00a0 Chew and I suppose Des Roches Rosa are possibly in denial of having children who are impaired.\u00a0 They can't cope with the hurt and the pain so they use this as a psychological defense mechanism.\u00a0 This is to deny that there is anything wrong with their children.\u00a0 This goes with saying that autism is not a defect that needs to be cured, but that progress can be made and the child with the correct accommodations can function as well as a normal kid.\u00a0 This is a denial of reality but perhaps it makes these mothers feel better about their offspring.\u00a0 Others are displacement and projection, thus getting angry at anyone who wishes a cure for their child or who has something like the ransom notes thing that clinic in New York had.\u00a0 Most intriguing of all is reaction formation, taking something you hate and and claiming to love it.\u00a0 Instead of hating autism, they use this defense mechanism to celebrate it, to claim that Gates and Einstein were autistic and that autism is a great thing and not a bad thing and it can be worked with.\n\nPerhaps these defense mechanisms are why Chew makes the outlandish statements that she does and why Des Roches Rosa would stick up for a convoluted movement like neurodiversity.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2013/01/why-did-amy-sf-lutz-attack.html",

{"date": " September 19, 2012", "body": "\nI was interested to recently read about research that the media is implying could lead the way to finding drugs that can reverse or maybe cure autism.The above-linked article states that genetic mutations for certain proteins called neuroligins can cause autism.\u00a0 These are proteins that are necessary for synaptic transmission between neurons, or, to put it more simply, communication between brain cells.\u00a0 If this communication is disrupted, various problems could result.\u00a0 These might be described as autism.\n\nThe researchers inserted so-called \"knock in\" mutated genes in mice that lead to various motor impairments and lack of social behavior which could be considered an animal model for autism.\u00a0 They also used \"knock out\" mice (mice who have had the gene for neuroligin-3 knocked out) as well.\u00a0 The brains had abnormal synaptic connections and an excessive number of glutamate (a neurotransmitter-substance that communicates between brain cells) receptor\u00a0 \n\nWhat was most interesting is that when the researchers inserted neuroligin proteins in the brain, they were able to reverse this process and the brains of the mice normalized and their autistic symptoms disappeared.\u00a0 Roche pharmaceuticals, who apparently hopes to develop a drug to conquer autism, collaborated with these researchers in Switzerland. \n\nIntrigued by this research, I emailed Peter Scheiffele, one of the authors of this study, asking him to send me a .pdf file.\u00a0 Dr. Scheiffele kindly sent me a copy of his study.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMy lack of training as a scientist limited my understanding of\u00a0 the paper, but I believe I got the gist of it.\u00a0 Though it might hold promise for some persons with autism at some point, it seems to me the media may be hyping this study prematurely. \n\nVarious genes have been implicated in autism.\u00a0 Most cases of autism are probably polygenetic, i.e. involving interactions of several genes rather than just one.\u00a0 Also, environmental factors may contribute as well, interacting with the genes.\u00a0 The neuroligin mutation is just a single genetic mutation existing on the X chromosome and not on any of the other chromosomes.\u00a0 Genes on autosomes (the non sex chromosomes) have been found to be implicated in autism, so the neuroligin mutations are probably just a small percentage of possible casual factors for autism.\u00a0 Also, the authors only studied the neuroligin-3 protein (NL3).\u00a0 neuroligin-4 (NL4) has also been implicated in autism.\u00a0 There may be a number of X chromosome linked( including Fragile X) etiologies for autism.\u00a0 Females have two X chromosomes and males have one (their second sex chromosome is the Y chromosome) so this may be one of the reasons there's a 4:1 ratio of male autistics to females.\u00a0 If all autisms were caused by an X-linked mutation, it's likely the ratio of males to females would be much higher or autistic females would be nonexistent.\u00a0 Hemophilia and pattern baldness are examples of x-linked genetic conditions that are probably nearly non-existent in females.\u00a0 So, it is unlikely this research could be applied to all forms of autism.\n\nThe authors stated that in their mice models synaptic transmission was altered in in somatosensory cortex and hippocampus.\u00a0 They went on to say that the subcellular localization in living creatures of the NL3 protein was unknown.\n\nFor reasons not entirely clear to me, they only focused on the cerebellum and not on any other areas of the brain.\u00a0 Their rationale was that this was because one study had shown cerebellar activation was altered in autistic individuals and cerebellar lesions in animal models resulted in changes reminiscent of autism.\u00a0 This is in spite of the fact that other areas of the brain, i.e. the frontal lobes and limbic system (including the amygdala) have also been implicated in autism. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nWhether or not these mice who normally are incapable of speaking and modeling language, fine motor and other possible symptoms of autism are a valid animal model is questionable to me. \n\nIn addition to finding glutamatergic synapses altered, they also found GABAergic synapses were altered.\u00a0 GABA (along with norepinephrine) is one of the neurotransmitters that are used in cerebellar purkinje cells, which have been implicated in some autopsies of postmortem autistic brains (granular cells not being found to be as affected if I'm remembering correctly).\u00a0 Interestingly, GABA is the neurotransmitter implicated in the lack of inhibition that Dr. Manuel Casanova has found in his work showing abnormal minicolumns in the postmortem brains of some autistic adults.\u00a0 \n\nThey also found increased synaptic connections in the wiring of the cerebellar network. \u00a0\u00a0 \nThe rats were tested in a climbing ladder task and the mice with the NLG knock out mice were impaired.\n\nAs mentioned before, the next phase of the experiment was to reinsert the neuroligin proteins into the mice brains.\u00a0 These mice's brains were apparently restored to their normal synaptic functioning levels and the excess synapses were pruned.\u00a0 Whether this can ever be used as a legitimate autism treatment or prevention I don't know.\n\nWhat was noteworthy was that the abnormal synaptic pathophysiology of the NLG affected mice paralleled what has been found in fragile x mice and a mutation called Tsc2 which I'd never heard of.\n\nAt the end of the article the authors implied this research showed that the structural differences in the brains of persons with autism could be reversed after the brain has completely developed.\n\nI tried my best to give a take on this study with my limited education and knowledge, I apologize in advance for whatever factual errors or other problems there might be in this post; however, I do have an intense interest in this research, though perhaps a lack of ability to fully grasp it.\u00a0 \n\nI can't help hoping that research like this might someday be used to treat, prevent and even perhaps cure autism at some point in time, but I can't help thinking the ballyhoo of this study is just more media hype.\u00a0 \n\nAddendum:\u00a0 I've now downloaded the FTP program I'd used in the past on Windows XP on Windows 7 and figured out how to use it.\u00a0 I uploaded the .pdf of the paper to my stories website and tried to link to it on this post.\u00a0 However, it did not seem to load for some reason, not sure why.\u00a0 I'll see if I can provide a link to the paper at some point. \n\n", "outgoing_links":

ASAN researcher Stephen Kapp cites research obtained by a K. Doheny retrieved from web M.D., but neglects to cite a journal article.\u00a0 A search of Google scholar fails to find such research done by this individual.\u00a0 If anyone can come up with a more specific reference, of course, Gadfly will stand corrected. \u00a0 Fein et. al., in a typical scientific hedge, merely don't discount the possibility that there may be residual symptoms in the optimal outcome group, but stated that further study was necessary to elucidate on this.\u00a0 \n\nASAN also implies that these optimal outcome subjects felt suicidal yet neglects to present any evidence.\u00a0 They have also stated that these people are still autistic but just have the ability to pass for \"normal\" persons.\u00a0 This effort to pass they claim, leads to stress, anxiety, depression and even the possibility of suicide, yet they only provide speculation and no concrete evidence to back up these assertions.\n\nMost troubling of all (at least to yours truly) is their statement:\n\nAutistic people do not \u201crecover\u201d and the idea of \u201crecovery\u201d has been \nprofoundly damaging to the Autistic community, encouraging service \nproviders to emphasize normalcy above other more meaningful goals. \nFurthermore, by teaching Autistic children and adults that \u201crecovery\u201d \u2013 \npretending to be something we are not \u2013 is the \u201coptimal outcome\u201d they \ncan achieve, we send a profoundly damaging message to Autistic people, \nour families, and the public at large.

{"date": " March 23, 2012", "body": "\nI've just read an interesting post on one of my favorite autism blogs, \"M.J's\" Autism Jabberwocky. MJ writes about an article that appeared online in Science Daily. Cognitive neuroscience Nilli Lavie has claimed that her recent study has demonstrated that autistics have superior perceptual processing capacity. She goes further in claiming that these strengths can be capitalized on and help autistics in their life activities and possibly be the stepping stone into a lucrative career in the IT industry. She goes further to claim that the findings of her research may demonstrate why so many persons with autism are successful computer programmers, network administrators, etc.I haven't read the primary source, i.e. Lavie's actual article published in the journal of abnormal psychology, so I won't comment on the validity of her research or even whether or not it has the clinical applications that she's claiming. I'm still awaiting a single example of an autistic person who was helped by this type of research and any studies showing a benefit. This is particularly true of rogue physician and scientist Laurent Mottron who has made similar claims yet has provided no evidence of persons who have been helped by treatments based on this research, particularly an autist who made it in the IT biz. This is particularly germane given the fact this was the rationale given for Mottron's half a million dollar research grant from Autism Speaks.I am curious as to exactly how many individuals with a bonafide autism diagnosis actually have been successful in careers in IT. I'd be willing to bet dollars to doughnuts that though there may actually be some individuals who fit the bill, they are very few and far between. I still remember my unsuccessful attempts to get into this profession, but more about that later.One striking statement in the science daily article was that the numbers of autism diagnoses tripled in the silicone valley during the 1990s. The author of this article quotes Steve Silberman's wired piece as a source. As I said, I haven't read Lavie's article so I don't know if she herself wrote it to bolster her case and it's been a few years or more since I read Silberman's piece so I don't remember exactly what he said either. Even if there were significant increases in the rates of autism in the silicone valley, were they unique as compared to other parts of California. According to figures from the CDDS The answer would appear to be no. Though between July of 1992 and July of 2007 the number of autsitic clients the San Andreas regional center served increased from 213 to 1,798, a 8.4 fold increase, rates in some other parts of the state were no different or significantly larger. The Frank Lanterman center's number went from 209 to 1,962, a more than 9.3 fold increase. North Los Angeles Regional Center's numbers were 437 to 3,708-a fractionally greater increase than San Andreas. East Los Angeles, a relatively poor area with no IT industry went from 150 to 2,040 clients, a 13.6 fold increase. This is more than 1.5 times higher than San Andreas. Valley Mountain regional center went from 68 to 1,178 for a 17.3 fold increase or more than double San Andreas. It would appear, compared to other parts of the state the Silicone valley was hardly a bastion of growth due to IT genes or any other factor. I believe this sort of puts a gaping hole in the argument purported by those who want to use autism prevalence figures to argue for autism increases being caused by an aptitude for computer programming.I still remember my own failed attempts to become a computer programmer. I took a variety of computer programming courses on and off in the 1980's and 1990s. Though I did learn a bit, it was nowhere near enough to become a professional programmer. Unlike the autistics in Dr. Lavie's and Mottron's studies, I was unable to concentrate or pay attention to details at anywhere near the level of a neurotypical person. Though I worked intermittently in other professions, I was fired from multiple jobs and had to quit working early on in my life.Therefore, I don't think it's helpful for Drs. Lavie and Mottron to put up simplistic solutions to difficult problems such as that of the many autistics' inability to make a living.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/03/jabberwocky-of-day-autism-gives-higher.html", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120322100313.htm", "http://www.dds.ca.gov/Autism/docs/AutismReport_2007_Page11Addendum.pdf"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/03/does-autistics-higher-perceptual.html", "title": "\nDoes an autistic's higher perceptual capacity translate into a lucrative IT career?\n"},
{"date": " March 25, 2012", "body": "\nI read with interest (albeit admittedly with limited understand)the new article that demonstrates evidence for a genetic etiology for the abnormal brain growth and other anomalies in autism. Scientific American has published an overview of this work that's more understandable to the lay person (myself included) than the primary source, which I've also linked to above.One finding that I think at least some labs have replicated is abnormal brain growth in autism. Eric Courchesne recently published a study demonstrating abnormal brain growth in the prefrontal cortex of postmortem autistic subjects and finding autistic brains have 67% more neurons in this area than normal controls. I've written about this elsewhere.This study examined genetic pathways and defects in postmortem brains of both autistic children and adults as compared to age-matched controls.One of the striking findings of this work was the fact that the genetic defects and how they affected the brain were qualitatively different in the adult group than in children.The last sentence in the conclusion section of the article is particularly compelling: Further knowledge of the specific developmental neurobiological mechanisms behind the age-dependent anomalies reported here could point to distinct early developmental processes that lead to autism, uncover mechanisms that respond to early pathologies in the mature brain and suggest novel molecular targets for prevention strategies and treatment over the course of the disorder .This study may have relevance to two well-known tenets in the autism community: 1. Early intervention makes a difference in the outcome of autistic children. The earlier the treatment is started the better the prognosis. 2. One of the main arguments of the neurodiversity movement that the term \"prevention\" is in reality a codeword for abortion and that genetic research in autism will only lead to widespread termination of pregnancies involving autistic fetuses. The ND movement gives the oft-cited statistic of a more than 90% abortion rate of Down's syndrome children as evidence for this. There are probably a number of problems with this argument, but that may be the subject of a future gadfly blog post.Though the \"early intervention\" mantra is repeatedly chanted to parents of small autistic children by entrepeneurs financed by the IDEA law (ABA practitioners and others), to the best of my knowledge, no studies have been done linking age of intake to a more favorable prognosis or outcome. As I've written before, I underwent psychoanalysis beginning the late 1950s. This was the intervention of choice in those days. I went from nonverbal feces smearing to mildly impaired autistic during this time period. Was it the psychoanalysis that helped me? Have ABA and other more contemporary interventions been responsible for at least partial recovery of those with autism? I believe the differences between the postmortem brains in the children versus adults as well as different genetic pathways may account for recovery in some cases. Some persons who had certain types of genetic defects as children, may not have had the as adults. Perhaps the adults without certain deficiencies did not have genes that interfered with patterns repairing neurons etc. Perhaps that accounts for recoveries rather than early intervention. Though admittedly it is speculation, I don't believe this hypothesis is farfetched. ASAN and other neurodiversity organizations have repeatedly claimed that all research funded by Autism speaks, the Simons foundation, etc. has a goal of finding a way abort autistic fetuses. This includes fMRI studies and studies of TMS and mu wave suppression which do not appear to have any relevance to genetic research to a reasonable person. This paper may be the start of empirical evidence, that in fact, genetic research is our ace in the hole for preventing autism. No, not aborting the autistic fetus, but perhaps finding the genetic mechanisms prenatally that cause this brain overgrowth and possibly other problems the autistic may have. For this reason, I believe studies like this should be funded and it may have promising implications of being able to prevent the fetus from becoming autistic in the first place or even possibly helping those already born.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002592", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/23/autism-brain-growth-genes-defective_n_1375254.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/03/new-autism-genetic-brain-growth-study.html", "title": "\nNew autism genetic brain growth study may refute some urban legends\n"},
{"date": " February 15, 2012", "body": "\nIt was with interest that I read about a new study showing that autism affects motor skills. Claudia Hilton and John Constantino of the University of Washington studied many children with autism on standardized tests of motor performance. They found that motor skills were saliently lacking in the vast majority of children they studied.This relates to my own life as I have fairly bad motor impairments myself. I did not learn how to tie my shoes until age 8, and had great difficulty in performing this. Though I can print somewhat legibly with great effort, I still have a handwriting impairment and my scrawl looks very much like \"brain-damaged\" writing. I still remember in the early 1960s when I saw a variety of handwriting tutors and had to have my recess taken away for a brief time to find time to give me extra help in this area. I also had tutoring in perceptual motor skills designed to help these problems but to no avail. I have difficulty wrapping presents and other fine skilled movements. However, my ability to type is more than intact.I wondered if this was part of my autism as I had read about Stephen Wiltshire, Temple Grandin and others with extraordinary fine motor skills. To this day, I have never met a person, autistic or otherwise, who has a \"fine motor coordination problem\" as I have. I had read that autistic persons generally score higher on the performance part of the Wechsler IQ test than on the verbal portion. With myself, the opposite is true, where there is about a 40 point discrepancy between my relatively high verbal IQ and low performance IQ. Some studies, such as the ones done by the Mottron group and Uta Frith as well as others, show that at least some autistics have superior ability in the block design test on the Wechsler performance. I score in the retarded range on this. So, I have wondered if there was a subtype of autism involving poor motor skills. It would appear, from this study, that I'm not the only one.The authors of this study speculate that the brain processes that give rise to motor coordination and social skills are controlled by a common area. It's possible that the frontal lobes are a candidate as they mediate the mirror neuron areas which could be involved in social judgement. In a previous post I wrote about parallels in autism and frontotemporal dementia which included poor social skills. So, I have to wonder if this could be key to the etiology of my problems.Some of the motor and perceptual impairments I have also exist in adult patients with lesions of the right hemisphere of the parietal lobes called constructional apraxia. However, I might not have this as Eric Courchesne pointed out to me that adult lesions and developmental lesions might have different etiologies. When their research group did an MRI scan on me, they found I had hypoplasia of lobules VI and VII of the cerebellar vermis as compared to a normal control. This could explain my good typing motor coordination. Perhaps if the cerebellar damage occurs early enough it won't affect some of the autistics motor performance. However, in light of this recent study, I wonder if the cerebellum could be involved. Though, I'm not sure if it is involved in social judgement.What Courchesne told me may have been slightly contradicted in a study done in the 1970s by Ralph Maurer and Antonio Demasio showing parallels between autism and problems in adult neurology patients with frontal lobe and basal ganglia impairments.The basal ganglia are other brain areas that are involved in motor performance.The reticular formation is another. In 1964, Bernard Rimland speculated that this area may be involved in autism. I don't think there is any empirical evidence to back that up.It was somewhat of a relief to read about this study, as it means I may not be as atypical an autistic as I thought. Knowing about motor impairments may someday give me a clue to the etiology of my problems. I await further research.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencecodex.com/autism_affects_motor_skills_study_indicates-86111", "http://www.autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/02/interesting-parallels-between-ftd-and.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/02/study-finds-autism-affects-motor-skills.html", "title": "\nStudy finds autism affects motor skills\n"},
{"date": " February 10, 2012", "body": "\nIt was with interest that I read an article in today's L.A. times about frontotemporal dementia. The man described in the article had a variety of social judgment impairment problems. When he stood in line behind a tattooed woman he said loudly, \"Wow, that's a lot of tattoos.\" He would wander into property with no trespassing signs. This condition, also called 'Pick's disease', is similar to Alzheimer's in that it is caused by the buildup of proteins in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain resulting in the degeneration of neurons in these areas. Alzheimer's usually happens in the area of the hippocampus and surrounding areas where it affects memory. FTD happens in a different area of the brain, thusly producing different types of manifestations and symptoms.Upon looking at yet another website. It appears that some other symptoms can be inability to speak, echolalia and lack of emotional warmth.I can't help but seeing some of the parallels between this condition and autism. Of course, this may be superficial. Those who believe that mercury could be the cause of autism have tried to demonstrate that there are similarities between the symptoms of those two conditions. Others, such as Karin Nelson and Margaret Bauman, have disputed these showing there are differences as well.I have to wonder if what is known about FTD could open the door into resolving the mysteries of the etiology of autism. I'm interested in knowing exactly what have caused the myriad of problems and disability that I've had in my life.A variety of research has suggested that autism could be caused by problems in the frontal lobes of the brain, particularly the most recent autopsy study published by Courchesne, et. al. I wrote about this research and the relationship to my life about a few months ago. Also, the data from the mirror neuron research done by Marco Iacoboni, Mirella Depratto(sp?) and others have also suggested frontal lobe involvement. Based on other frontal lobe impairments this area of the brain could be considered a good candidate, as it is where Broca's area, which generates spontaneous speech is located. Also, the frontal lobes are responsible for executive functioning.I think the temporal lobes have been implicated in the etiology also but I'm not as familiar with this area. I do remember the Kluver-Bucy syndrome in monkeys whose temporal lobes were removed and the social problems and aggression it caused.A problem with this line of thinking is that developmental impairments may be different than adult impairments. I asked Eric Courchesne about this when I first met him back in 1989. At the time, their research showing the hypoplasia of lobules VI and VII of the cerebellar vermis was making news. If the cerebellum were responsible for the problems of autistics, I wondered why they would have intact motor systems much of the time. His answer was that if the damage occurred early enough, it would not affect the motor abilities of persons with autism. Developmental lesions were different than adult lesions.I have a bad handwriting and fine motor coordination problems, but my ability to type and do other types of motor activities is intact. These problems are sort of similar to the constructional apraxias of adults that have had lesions in the right hemisphere of the parietal lobe. A cerebellar impairment would not explain my ability to type fast unless what Courchesne said about the differences between developmental and adult lesions were true.After I read Marco Iacoboni's book, I contacted him and wondered why if mirror neurons were deficient in persons with autism, why didn't someone with Broca's aphasia from a stroke develop autistic-like behaviors. I wondered if it were because developmental lesions were different than adult lesions. He responded stating that this could possibly be the case and also that the frontal lobes were just one part of the mirror neuron system so this could be a reason as well.My disability has made it too difficult for me to apply myself and study neuroscience as extensively as I want to. Even if it didn't, I guess no one really knows exactly what causes autism.The article about the frontotemporal dementia in today's times was quite intriguing. I was interested in reading about Stuart Bryant's problems. There did seem to be some parallels with autism, though I suppose it may not provide a clue about my problems or what is wrong with myself.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-dementia-20120210,0,5574998.story", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001752/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/02/interesting-parallels-between-ftd-and.html", "title": "\ninteresting parallels between FTD and autism\n"},
{"date": " April 2, 2012", "body": "\nIronically, right around the time of April Fools day,the federal government announced the names of the new appointees to the public membership of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee. This is the agency that was created under the combating autism act where members of the general public, along with federal government members are appointed to give input and vote on autism policy. In the past(though I'm not certain about now) the Federal members outnumbered the public members. They voted on what they wanted, and I doubt the public members actually had much power to make meaningful contributions.Three of the appointees' names particularly stood out for me:1. Matthew Carey2. John Elder Robison3. (Last but certainly not least) Scott Robertson.The combating autism act was designed with the intent of actually curing and eradicating autism. I'd like to discuss the incredible incongruity of appointing these three individuals to this position.Nearly three years ago, I wrote a blog post explaining why I did not believe that members of the neurodiversity movement should be allowed to be heard by the IACC. This was in response to a post one of the three aforementioned appointees wrote.Now in what I hope was either an early April Fools joke or a nightmare from which I'll awake tomorrow morning, it's happened. We now have three individuals from this movement who are not only being heard by the IACC but are actually on the board themselves.Matt Carey, AKA \"Sullivan\", is at least a somewhat pro neurodiversity blogger who has a propensity to make numerous factual errors in posts that try to rebut those of us who have an intense dislike for the neurodiversity movement. He has gotten it wrong on special education law, gotten it wrong on whether or not Ari Ne'eman said that autism was not a disability and gotten it wrong about a certain individual who does not like ND, falsely claiming this person threatened Ne'eman with death. Carey has consistently stated the strawman that those of us who don't like neurodiversity are against civil and human rights. As this is one of their standard lines, I won't bother to comment on the absurdity of this. Carey has been very pro special ed and the IDEA law, yet apparently is against curing autism. He apparently believes the taxpayers should foot the bill for his son's disability which he is opposed to curing.John Robison is another individual who has stated there is no need for a cure for autism. To his credit, he has acknowledged that autism is a disability that needs research for remediation. Though quite wealthy, he has accepted funding from autism speaks for his son's and Alex Plank's autism talk TV, while most persons with autism are crippled and sick and languish in poverty. He has suggested studying geek success as a legitimate scientific endeavor. He seems to either not understand that a newborn has a nearly equal chance of being a boy or a girl or comes up with some strange theory that parents of autistic children are at least four times more likely to have a son as their firstborn and then an equal chance of either sex with subsequent children. Though he has not even completed the tenth grade in school, he serves on scientific advisory boards with M.D. and Ph.D. scientists. Most notable of all, his friend, Alex Plank, whom he has helped secure funding for, has stated that autism is a good thing. So, though Robison has stated that many facets of autism are disabling and need research for remediation, I wonder if we can judge him by the company he keeps.As I said before, last but not least is Scott Robertson, one of the top executives in the autistic self-advocacy network, second-in-command to Ari Ne'eman. Though ASAN has publically opposed the combating autism act, they apparently feel it is okay to be the beneficiaries of tax dollars paid for created out of a law that they disagree with. They have stated that curing autism (the purpose for which the combating autism act and the IACC which they now have a seat on was enacted) would be morally rephrensible. ASAN or their representatives have used murder of autistic children as a political tool, they have stated that autism and Asperger's are not disabilities, and they have implied that autistic people who are unable to hold jobs who disagree with what they are doing are welfare bums who in their words should be strangled to death and turned into cat food or taken out, lined up against a wall and be shot.To date, not a single person on the spectrum who favors curing autism has been appointed as a public member of the IACC.

{"date": " February 18, 2012", "body": "\nI've previously written about Ari Ne'eman, an individual in his early 20s who has never had paid employment. In spite of his total lack of experience working, he seems to feel qualified to give input on solving the problems of unemployment among persons with autism.As I mentioned before, one of Ne'eman's solutions was to eliminate social pleasantry as a hiring criteria or use it to evaluate an individual's work performance. Any individual who has spent even the briefest time in any workplace knows having good social skills is necessary to be and stay employed. No employer or fellow co-workers are going to overlook poor social skills and be patient with an autistic person who shouts at them, makes inappropriate comments or gropes women in the workplace. As John Robison pointed out in the comments section, no amount of legislation is ever going to change this.It seems that Mr. Ne'eman is at it again, giving a presentation at the autism works conference on how people with autism can get and keep jobs.It appears, in spite of my blog post, he has not given up on this idea. He presents a concept he refers to as \"social architecture\", borrowing from the Americans with Disabilities Act. The analogy he uses is the legal requirement that ramps be required for persons who use wheel chairs and in the same vein, autistics poor social skills can be accommodated in the workplace.However, this apples to hurricanes analogy indeed falls flat. Social skills aren't walking and mobility. There is no way that the autistics' faux pas can be accommodated for in the workplace as mentioned above. Ne'eman seems quite vague in how this can be done. He does not seem to provide any specific analogy for wheel chair ramps, because there isn't one. There is no treatment that can mitigate the persons social skills. All the wishful thinking in the world on Ne'eman's part isn't going to make society overlook them.Another issue, is that lack of social ability is probably not the largest factor in an autistics' inability to obtain employment. The impairments that prevented me from concentrating on work also lead to my termination from various positions. The fact that I and others like myself are too impaired to get adequate education and training for most jobs is yet another major issue. Ne'eman and other members of ASAN with virtually no work experience don't address these issues at all in their programs to help autistics find and keep jobs.Ne'eman is also developing a resume bank designed for college graduates on the spectrum. However, I wonder about the percentage of autistics who actually graduate college with a four year degree. I strongly suspect it's quite low. Even for those high-functioning enough to obtain this education, there may not be much on a resume that is of use as most of them are quite young and don't have much experience in the career they're trying to pursue. Ne'eman is approaching a variety of private firms and attempting to address the issues of social barriers---the only comment I have is good luck in that endeavor.Also, the mortgage company Freddie Mac has apparently entered into an agreement with ASAN to provide internships for those on the spectrum, Interestingly, Ne'eman is claiming these internships are paid positions, which seems odd as usually interns are people who volunteer in order to get experience.It's interesting the neurodiversity movement would pick an organization that with its encouragement of subprime interest loans to persons who could never afford houses likely helped caused the largest economic crisis since the great depression. This organization (along with its sister Fannie Mae)went broke and cost the taxpayers more than 170 billion bucks in a bailout that has never been paid back. Gee, ASAN, you sure now how to pick a winner. I suspect an association with Freddie mac would be a liability on someone's resume, not an asset as Ne'eman is claiming, though I suppose I might be wrong about that.As an individual on the spectrum who had great difficulty in the workplace, I resent Ne'eman discussing issues which he himself has no personal experience or knowlege. I don't believe it's productive for individuals to put up a conference offering simplistic solutions to real and hard problems.I wish Ne'eman would go out and get a real job and actually get some life experience and work experience before trying to propose remedies.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://dps.missouri.edu/Autism/2012AWNC/Ari_Ne%27eman.pdf", "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/04/opinion/fannie-mae-freddie-mac-and-the-financial-crisis.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/02/autism-in-workplace-neemans-at-it-again.html", "title": "\nautism in the workplace: Ne'eman's at it again\n"},
{"date": " January 2, 2012", "body": "\nI'm gratified to see Susan Senator and The age of autism are bringing attention to the problems of autism in adulthood which are largely ignored by the media. I wrote about this several years ago.One of the likely reasons for the dearth of coverage of adult autism is the reluctance to acknowledge the poor prognosis that most with this condition will have once they reach the milestone of their twenty-second birthday. This is the time when autistics age out of the special education system and can no longer get certain services.Ivar Lovaas' landmark study claimed that approximately half of the children in the treatment group achieved complete normalcy. These children were followed up in adolescence and had maintained their gains. However, Lovaas in his lifetime never published adult outcomes of these children though the oldest are now in their forties. We don't know what became of these children and how they fared later in life.Other pie-in-the-sky promises are made for autistics with social skills training, speech therapy and other services. The insurance mandates being passed in so many states that autism speaks lobbied for is attempting to fulfil these promises. AS even went so far as to claim these services would make the difference between kids having friends and not having friends.Ms. Senator, who wrote a book ironically entitled \"Making Peace With Autism\", now seems to have some trouble making peace with the fact that her son has aged out of this system and the obstacles she now faces as his mother. In spite of the fact that her son received multiple services under IDEA, he has not done well as an adult and Ms. Senator was compelled to put him in a home at age seventeen. Will others on the spectrum do as poorly or better than her son? Time will tell.Another reason is that not as many adults have been diagnosed as children. Some believe that this is because there were huge increases in autism that started in the 1980s and then took off in the 1990s. Others believe that autism is a much more popular diagnosis because it enables disabled children to get services and cultural shifts in thinking. This debate will probably never be resolved as doing prevalence studies in adults analogous to the ones done on children will never happen. One must remember the analogy about looking for a needle in a haystack. The reason the CDC was able to get nearly 1% prevalence figures in children was because they presented to special education services and such; this does not happen with adults. The Brugha study done in England attempted to address this problem, but likely had a variety of methodological flaws which makes it claims of finding a 1% prevalence in adults dubious.Now that the year is 2012 and the population of the birth cohorts in which a diagnosis was more common are coming of age. So we're going to see more problems that autistics face in adulthood come to the fore. Ari Ne'eman's no myths video will be shown to be a myth itself. Ne'eman and others like him won't be able to get away with painting a false rosy picture of autistics doing just fine in maturity.\u3000Perhaps this is the start of something new. Adults with autism won't be so invisible anymore. We will no longer regard autistics as Peter Pans who won't grow up. With this new publicity we'll be able to assess how really effective ABA and the IDEA law have been. I realize the insurance mandates are something new. The powers that be may use that as an excuse claim that all hope should not be abandoned.In the meantime, I hope that Senator's piece as well as the age of autism's coverage will generate even more publicity. Perhaps it's high time those of us who suffer from autism in adulthood get the coverage we deserve.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/tiger-mother-to-an-autistic-son/2011/12/20/gIQALGUTEP_story.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2012/01/washington-post-no-one-has-real-answers-they-didnt-then-and-they-dont-now.html", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/invisible.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/01/more-media-attention-to-autistic-adults.html", "title": "\nMore media attention to autistic adults in the future?\n"},

This is interesting in light of the fact that they have given rogue scientist laurent mottron a half million dollar grant when he has not only stated that the notion of curing autism is nonsensical but has gone even further, saying along with morton gernsbacher and michelle dawson that autism is a harmless condition. It is also strange in light of the fact that they have John Robison on their scientific advisory board, in spite of his questionable qualifications and Mr. Robison has referred to them, one Alex Plank and has talked to autism speaks and gotten them to cough up money for this individual's films. Mr. Plank has stated in the past that most autistics don't want to be cured and has stated that autism is a good thing in the title bar of his website, wrong planet. Plank partners with Robison's son.To digress, gadfly wonders if Ari Ne'eman and ASAN will vociferously protest the combating autism act as they have done in the past along with inconsistencies pointed out by autism's gadfly. As has been stated before on this blog, neurodiversity fought this law tooth and nail when it was first being debated in congress as a bill. After they lost that battle, they took the if you can't beat 'em, join 'em perspective so rampant in the neurodiversity movement. Katie Miller, Ari Ne'eman and other ND's presented their agenda before the IACC, claiming that individuals such as myself should be crippled and sick when it completely contradicted the intentions of the new law. This was not good enough for them. They were able to get ari ne'eman appointed to an actual seat on the IACC. The combating autism act specified that at least one individual on the spectrum would be a public member. Along with Ne'eman, conference superstar Stephen Shore serves in this capacity also. Shore, is an individual who is barely affected by his autism if at all. In addition to his prolific conference presentations, he has a doctorate, is an assistant professor and has published numerous books. He is also married. He opposes a cure for autism in spite of serving on a government board created for that specific purpose. To date, the number of pro-cure autistics who have been appointed as public members of the IACC is zero. Alex Plank and others may want to deny that we actually exist, but we are definitely out there. Gadfly wonders if the intent of this law and the creation of the IACC was in order to combat autism and find a cure, then why have there never been any pro cure autistics appointed but two anti-cure autistics. If neither bill passes congress, the CAA will be sunseted and cease to exist. Isn't this what Ari Ne'eman and ASAN wanted prior to 2007? Yet, if Ne'eman and company again take to the streets with placards, he will be depriving himself of one of his two government posts to get his agenda across. Is this what he wants? Only time will tell. Public members don't even have to attend meetings, they can just do a video phone-in thing on a website. What sense is there having an agency like this?Well, once again, folks, welcome to another circus sideshow without a tent. I will be interested in what Ne'eman and ASAN do about the reauthorization of the CAA.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2011/05/26/dont-let-the-sun-go-down-on-combating-autism-act/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/05/will-ari-neeman-oppose-combating-autism.html", "title": "\nWill Ari Ne'eman oppose the combating autism act this time around?\n"},
{"date": " May 28, 2011", "body": "\nIn answer to my question from my last post, the answer is yes. Ne'eman and ASAN have gone on record as opposing the reauthorization of the combating autism act which is now currently a bill that has been introduced in both houses of congress. Gadfly wonders why this is, since Ne'eman has accepted public membership on the interagency autism coordinating committee which was authorized as part of the combating autism act. Ordinarily, this would seem a strange inconsistency. As has been documented meticulously on numerous occasions on autism's gadfly, these sort of waffling, hypocritical and contradictory actions seem par for the course for Ne'eman and ASAN. If the combating autism act is indeed sunseted then Ne'eman will lose his coveted bully pulpit to preach his fire and brimstone neurodiversity homilies and call those who oppose him perpetrators of genocide as was done when economist Michael Ganz presented his cost/benefit analysis to the meeting that Mr. Ne'eman was in attendance of.If Ne'eman is so adamantly opposed to this law why would he not refuse his position with the IACC and refuse to be a beneficiary of a federal law and the tax dollars that go along with it?Ne'eman makes the dumbfounding statement:This legislation would keep in place a status quo without services, without consideration of the needs of adults and without inclusion of self-advocates. We urge Members of Congress to oppose any long term extension without needed program reforms.\u201dTo the contrary,the status quo is including Ne'eman, a self-advocate opposed to a cure and an at least one time proponent of the idea that autism and Asperger's are not disabilities. Though the combating autism act was designed to prevent and ultimately cure autism and the IACC was authorized by the CAA for that purpose, and provided that at least one person on the spectrum would serve on the IACC, to date, two anti-cure individuals (one of them Ne'eman) serve and to date not one pro-cure autistic has been appointed to the IACC or allowed any input on how government research should be funded. This also includes Stephen Shore (the other autistic IACC member) and John Robison (also opposed to curing autism) being able to make decisions on which government projects should be funded, though Shore's doctorate is in special ed and not in a scientific discipline and Robison never even completed high school. Not one pro-cure autistic, to my knowledge, has ever been allowed to review government studies, which should have, according to the law, as its intention to ultimately find a cure for autism.Ne'eman goes further to state:Many self-advocates also find the language of the act offensive and out of step with the mainstream of disability policy.If anyone is out of the mainstream of autism policy, it is Ne'eman and ASAN themselves, as most rational persons who are stakeholders believe autism is a disability and want it cured. If this were not the case, congress never would have passed the combating autism act in the first place and Bush would not have signed it into law. So far, the combating autism act has not done much good or helped anyone, let alone finding a cure for autism. My guess is it will be passed though. I would have been intrigued by Ne'eman's silence, given his appointment to the IACC. I guess that is no longer an issue and I now have the answer to the question of my previous post.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=147"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/05/ari-neeman-and-company-oppose-combating.html", "title": "\nAri Ne'eman and company oppose the combating autism act\n"},

About 2 minutes and 30 seconds or so into the video what this individual says is rather shocking. He states that the parents of low functioning autistic children wish their kids would 'drop dead'. I wonder why Ari Ne'eman has not complained to youtube or has not gone out of his way to disavow this video that his supporter made. Or does Ne'eman himself believe this? We have seen in the past that some supporters of neurodiversity whose blog was linked on the autism hub stated that parents of autistic children who support a cure for their children are like members of the ku klux klan who are forced to raise black children. When your humble blogger asked hub owner Dave Seidel about this, he refused to denounce that statement.We have also seen in the past that neurodiversity blogger \"the autistic bitch from hell\" calls autistics that she does not agree with who want a cure \"uncle toms\". She has also stated that those of us who have had trouble keeping a job due to our disability are lazy loafers who just want a government handout and won't take responsibility for our lives. Also she has stated that those of us who don't agree with her positions should either be taken out and shot or turned into catfood. This person has donated to ASAN. It is rumored that \"the autistic bitch from hell\" is in fact attorney Meg Evans who is secretary of Ne'eman's organization, ASAN one of the top people in the organization barely below Ne'eman himself in the chain of command.

{"date": " March 3, 2011", "body": "\nI see that Psychological Science has published a cool new article about mirror neurons for anyone who is interested in this subject as I am, I have linked to the article. The pace of research in this subject seems to be picking up.  There was some controversy about whether or not they existed in humans as well as in monkeys and birds and other animals, since direct experimentation on humans is obviously more difficult.  Of course, when neurosurgical procedures are done to help mitigate epilepsy and perhaps other conditions then experimentation is possible.  Apparently last year, a study along this line of thought has suggested that these neurons exist in humans also.  Prior to this there was indirect evidence that mirror neurons existed through functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.  One problem with this approach is that maybe like two-thirds of the neurons in these areas are not mirror neurons so if an entire brain area lights up or fails to light up on BOLD assessment then it is hard to distinguish effects from the other neurons.  Mirror neuron guru Marco Iacoboni has suggested mathematical modeling as a way around this problem.  Of course perhaps someday scanning will become more sophisticated and it will be possible to tease out the effects of individual cells in living humans. It also relates to autism as there are now probably more than 20 studies that have been done to assess mirror neuron dysfunction, in at least a limited pool of autism research subjects.  Of course, one of the problems with this approach, so rampant in autism research, is the use of higher functioning autistics rather than those more severely impaired who would not sit still in a scanner or be able to use a computer.  Out of all these studies, all but four of them have shown evidence of mirror neuron dysfunction in these individuals. Another interesting item is that there are some plans to study these neurons in rhesus monkeys based on Harlow's (and perhaps other persons') research showing autistic like behaviors in these monkeys when separated from their mothers at birth, such as rocking and eye contact impairments.  Going back as far back as about 1977 or 1978 I dreamed of using these monkeys as an animal model for autism when I still had my pipe dream of being a neuroscientist. I won't comment on it further as it might spoil it for anyone else who wants to read it, but this is a good pithy article that covers some of the stuff about mirror neurons and I recommend it as an interesting read.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2011/march-11/reflections-on-mirror-neurons.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/03/cool-new-piece-about-mirror-neurons.html", "title": "\ncool new piece about mirror neurons\n"},

Additionally, federal special education law does not have a precedent where people are required to have credentials or training.  This has been decided upon by the Supreme Court in the Shannon Carter case.  The Carter decision also set the precedent for a New York court decision Malkowitz v.

I still think of my own personal struggles in the workplace and my forced retirement at age 51 after years of effort. I was interested to see Grandin's figure of 3% employment among autistics. This is a far cry from Joseph of the natural variation blog's 30% rate of employment among autistics which he neglected to cite a source for and could not do so when I asked him. It is an even further cry from Joseph's assertion based on the UK prevalence study with questionable methodology that found 1% of the adult population in the UK in private households had autism and that they were employed in the same manner as non-handicapped people. I am still curious as to where Grandin gets this figure or where thereare any documentable figures or studies of employment rates among autistics anywhere. I have tried to find them myself on Google. Possibly due to my own ineptitude I was not able to find any. Of course if Grandin's figure is accurate I can take some solace in the fact that at various times in my life I was in the 97th percentile in terms of employability among ASD persons.Though her call for more autistics in the workplace is commendable, it is dubious that a company will lose out as she says or that autistics as a group (particularly when you look at the entire spectrum) will provide an asset to any company. Though I don't like saying it I believe it is the sad and unpleasant truth.I'm convinced that this group is one of the most untapped pools poolsof talent we have,\" said Best Buy's Webteam vice president Cindy HolkerAssuming this statement is true, I wonder where are the examples of all of the autistics who are employed by Best Buy and why we have not heard of them.People with mild autism or Asperger's syndrome are basically \"geeks,\" Grandin said. They have tremendous skills that can help corporations solve problems, grow sales and program a company's ways to greatness, she said.If this is true why does not Grandin give any examples besides Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. I believed that I have debunked the non-clinician Grandin's (who likely never met Gates) arguments in my essay undiagnosing Gates, Jefferson and Einstein, which the interested reader can link to from this blog. There is no evidence that Zuckerberg has autism and again this trivializes my horrible disability (and others' disability as well)Silicon Valley, Hollywood, corporate labs and IT departments are often \"loaded\" with well-paid individuals who live somewhere on the spectrum of autism, Grandin insisted.Many just haven't been diagnosed yet, she said, and so don't carry the label of the illness, which is typically characterized by heightened intellect, awkward social skills, black-and-white, literal reasoning, an intolerance of noise and the inability to read facial cues or body language.Again, no real examples, and one wonders why these people have not been diagnosed. Perhaps it is because they had no real impairments in their life that a legitimately diagnosed individual has had. So, they would not present to a doctor or psychologist for diagnosis and a comparison between these people and someone actually diagnosed with an ASD is likely not apt.Grandin emphasizes that social skills can be taught to ASD'ers in the workplace. I question the validity of this approach, given the consideration that voice volume and other behavioral quirks might not be easily controlled. Also, it assumes that life is not spontaneous and follows a script where every variable in the workplace can be accounted for. However, I do laud Grandin for acknowledging that social skills are necessary to obtain and maintain employment. This is in stark contrast to the never employed (excepting his patronage government job at the NDC) Ari Ne'eman, who has stated that an autistic's lack of social skills should be completely overlooked in the workplace.Gradin has assertedthat half of the silicone valley has something you would call Asperger's. I find it hard to believe she has even met one tenth of 1% of the people employed in the Silicone valley so I believe this is rather a stretch.Though Grandin's accomplishments and the obstacles she had to overcome to obtain them are laudable I do not believe that it is helpful for her to trivialize the employment problems of persons with autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.startribune.com/business/116500248.html", "http://www.indyweek.com/artery/archives/2011/02/21/half-of-silicon-valley-has-something-youd-call-aspergers-interview-with-temple-grandin"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/02/temple-grandin-autistics-asset-to.html", "title": "\nTemple Grandin: autistics asset to workplace?\n"},
{"date": " January 30, 2011", "body": "\nAn old acquaintance of mine sent me this interesting piece by economist and mutual fund manager, John Hussman, who has an autistic son and apparently moonlights as a genetic researcher with some other persons. The research involved genome wide sequencing of two different datasets, using a sophisticated computer algorithm that I don't really understand that studied what were called single nucleotide polymorphisms where there are normal variations in the genes of various people some of these can have risk alleles which are genes or a cluster of genes which can cause or predispose someone to conditions like Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, or autism.From what I understand of the article, they were saying that there are so many possible locations that could result in genes which cause alterations to proteins or instructions on how to construct neurons, etc., it is infeasible to examine them all by conventional methods. However, many of the SNP's that could cause autism might be in very close proximity to one other and the problem could be confounded by a large \"noise to signal ratio\". The researchers Hussman was associated with apparently used an algorithm which helped with the signal to noise ratio in finding candidate alleles that could cause or predispose someone to autism. Two different data sets, one from the University of Florida and another from the autism genetic resource exchange were used with the idea is that you might be able to find locations for the same candidate genes in two different data sets, then this might make a clearer picture for a possible genetic etiology of autism.I have written in the past about the simplistic statements that Simon Baron-Cohen and Temple Grandin and perhaps others have taken towards the genetics of autism in that perhaps there is only one or a few \"autism genes\" that have stayed in the population due to a protective effect and are responsible for every invention from the spear to the cell phone.As Hussman correctly states, the problem with this thinking is that instead of a few genes, there are probably hundreds of genes that operate in concert with each other which could have a small effect on many individuals or a large effect on a few individuals. But what was intriguing is that these hundreds of genes could operate on a common biological pathway, which might make an understanding of the etiology of autism clearer.With this computer algorithm, the researchers claim to have found a biologic pathway which could explain at least some aspects of autism. The biologic pathway regulates how axons and dendrites in a neuronal brain cell are formed and guides them to the appropriate places. For those who don't know, brain cells communicate with each other chemically and electronically by sending electrical pulses down what is called the axon of the cell. Then a chemical is released into a space called the synapse which is received by a dendrite of a neighboring brain cell. If something is amiss in genes that regulate this, then cells won't be able to communicate with each other properly and this lack of adequate transmission could cause the debilitating features of autism.Though admittedly I am far from a science expert, one problem with this research that I see is that autism is likely not 100% genetic, since though we have high concordance rates in identical twins, it is not 100%. Likewise, as I remember correctly some studies have shown fraternal twins have higher concordance rates than siblings who are not twins; it would be the same if autism were 100% genetic. So, there may be something else, besides abnormalities in single nucleotide polymorphisms such as some environment insult during the prenatal period that could cause a person to become autistic, though it is possible this pathway found by Hussman and the others might predispose a person to autism.I suppose Lorene Amet, a prolific commenter on autism's gadfly who has a doctorate in molecular biology can critique this research and correct me where I am going wrong if anywhere. Or possibly someone else better trained in science than I am.However, this research holds out hope, maybe not for me personally, but perhaps other persons who have yet to be born. If there is a common pathway influence by genetic mutations that results in abnormal cytoarchitecture can be found for many cases of autism, perhaps interventions could be done to prevent the person from becoming autistic in the first place and having to live with this disability. Hussman seems to imply this is the case.As I said, I wish I had more expertise on science so I could understand this stuff better and the possible implications it might have for helping or possibly even curing or preventing autism in the first place.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hussman.net/wmc/wmc110131.htm", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/01/has-holy-grail-molecular-pathway-for.html", "title": "\nhas holy grail molecular pathway for autism been identified?\n"},

Since they published his post on their blog, I also wonder if autism speaks is suggesting affirmative action as a remedy for helping autistic persons find jobs.This is interesting in light of the fact that autism speaks put on a dog and pony show suggesting how great it is that there are certain employers who hire persons with autism. I have written about this in a previous post. A notable fact is that autism speaks has suggested that employing autistic persons is a good idea, yet, as far as I know, they have never had a single paid autistic employee in their organization-not even as a minimum wage position with a job coach. I have to wonder, why autism speaks would be publishing Mr. Magro's post on such a subject in light of these circumstances. I also wonder why Mr. Magro would be writing about the virtues of affirmative action, yet not asking autism speaks to employ himself or some other deserving person with autism. I wonder if Mr. Magro is a believer in the concept of neurodiversity. This might help him get a job with autism speaks or perhaps encourage autism speaks to engage in some affirmative action and hire persons with autism in paid positions in their organization.Perhaps this sockpuppet of the ND movement should change their name from Autism Speaks to Autism Listens as this is what they seem to do 120% of the time that the ND behemoth speaks.When they found the \"I am autism\" video offensive, it was removed from the home page of their site.When neurodiversity wanted them to cough up cash to help them finance research that was aligned with their philosophy. Laurent Mottron, Isabelle Souleries and Michelle Dawson were given a half million dollar grant.When many adherents to the ND movement complained that there were no autistics on the board of directors or were placed in positions of power within the organization, they responded by appointing, John Robison to their science board. (Robison received an AS diagnosis at age 40). Robison, a high school dropout with no training or expertise in science or autism sits in a room with M.D. and Ph.D. scientists and decides what research AS will fund. It would seem the idea is that Robison can better represent the community of autistic persons in that he has experienced first hand what life is like for a person on the spectrum. I wonder how many persons with autism have been able to marry twice, father a son, get a $100,000 a year engineering job with no degree or formal training and write a best selling memoir. I know that I am not one of them. What have Robison's contributions to the field of autism research been so far? To date, he has seriously suggested studying geek success as a legitimate scientific endeavor.  He has lobbied and received funds for his own personal use when his son and his son's friend Alex Plank needed money to make films for their autism talk TV series, partially reimbursing Robison, the cash he laid out. Interestingly enough, the ND movement has offered solutions of their own to the problems of autistic persons in the workplace.  Ari Ne'eman a 21-year-old (at the time) who has never had paid employment of any kind has suggested eliminating social pleasantry as a criteria for hiring and receiving a good job evaluation.  Joseph of the natural variation blog has stated that in the near future, there would be a 70% rate of employment among persons with autism.  He projected that based on a supposed 30% rate of employment that currently exists but neglected to cite any reference for this figure or where it came from (assuming it came from someplace other than Joseph's imagination).  When I asked him, he was unable to produce a source for this figure.  Joseph then went even further claiming that unemployment was not a problem for autistic persons at all and they made in a living in the same manner as persons who were not handicapped.  He based this on a survey involving only 19 people with questionable methodology. I can be  reasonably certain that Mr. Magro is a 22-year-old with virtually no experience and probably limited qualifications for anything seeking employment in the worst economic times since the great depression.  This is certainly an arduous undertaking for someone without a disability let alone someone who has autism.  There are no easy solutions or quick fixes for an autistic person to make a living, other than trying very hard to amass qualifications, spending a lot of time applying for jobs.  It takes a great deal of work.  I know as I am an individual who spent more years than he or Ari Ne'eman have been alive doing just that.  I am proud that at least at one time I was able to work sporadically in spite of this horrific handicap.  I never looked for work in economic times like these though. If autism speaks does not want to practice what they preach and won't help Mr. Magro, I wish him the best of luck in finding employment.  Of course one solution for him, other than suggested in the previous paragraph might be for him to consult the ND movement and ask them to have a little chat with autism speaks.  Given AS's track with ND they'll probably listen.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2011/01/05/autisms-affirmative-action/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/01/is-autism-speaks-suggesting-affirmative.html", "title": "\nIs autism speaks suggesting affirmative action to help employ autistics?\n"},

I hope all gadfly readers had a good thanksgiving.A few regular readers of autism's gadfly may remember a post I wrote more than a year and a half ago plugging a book about complexity that my sister wrote and published. Well there is some more good news about Melanie's book. The phi beta kappa society has wisely decided to give her book an award. Our entire family is proud of Melanie.Simon Baron Cohen and Temple Grandin  (and perhaps Steve Silberman also) would have a field day about this autistic man's father, a pioneer in the field of computer engineering going back to the early 1950's and his sister, a Ph.D. computer scientist and artificial intelligence researcher. Maybe this proves how useful autism genes are to society, no matter that dad and sis got the good from the genes and I got the brunt of them.However, it is my mother's family who has a history of mental illness and learning disabilities and autism, so it is possible the genes from that side of the family contributed to my disease (that's right, disease, Laurent and Ari).Simon Baron-Cohen has speculated that the rise in autism may be partially because of assortive mating and the rise of the computer boon that engineers are more likely to meet and marry each other. I seem to remember I wrote a post about this on gadfly some time ago, but am having some trouble locating that post. If I do, I will go back in and edit this post.The point was is that Baron-Cohen wanted to do a study of how many male engineers were meeting and marrying female engineers, given that at one time it was not possible for these nerdy engineers to meet and marry and reproduce, creating all of these autistic genes and people. I wondered how SBC could explain the fact that my father, an engineer, and most the engineers and computer people he worked with in the 1950's and 1960s, during the computer's nascence were all married and none of their wives were engineers. Obviously these nerds were able to meet women and get married and this might be a flaw in this theory, as well as in Steve Silberman's theories and forthcoming book where it is quite possible that he will touch upon these issues.Well happy thanksgiving and kudos to my sister for winning that award.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.pbk.org/home/newsview.aspx?id=629", "http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/ethics/when-engineers-genes-collide"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/11/my-sisters-book-wins-award.html", "title": "\nmy sister's book wins an award\n"},

Apparently notoriety and commercial success as an author trumps scientific acumen as a qualification for making scientific decisions in both the public and private sectors. Likewise it also trumps federal law as someone who repeatedly engages in dialogue and activity undermining the noble cause of finding a way to prevent and cure autism as has been passed by the combating autism act.Of greatest concern to this blogger is the possibility that Robison may go to Washington hat in hand and ask for some taxpayer dollars for his own personal use and be given a handout by the federal government. We have seen Robison has done this in his capacity as an advisory board member of autism speaks. Apparently Autism Speaks has no scruples about this Robin Hood in reverse stuff. Neither Robison nor AS see any ethical lapse or conflict of interest in such things.With the federal government's track record, Gadfly can't help thinking that history could repeat itself.Along with Ari Ne'eman's participation in crafting autism public policy at taxpayer expense we see another fine example of our tax dollars at work.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/JohnElderRobison", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/science/overview/advisory_boards/scientific_advisory_board.php"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/10/mr-robison-goes-to-washington.html", "title": "\nMr. Robison goes to Washington\n"},

{"date": " September 28, 2010", "body": "\nNevada's republican candidate for the U.S. Senate has recently been mired in controversy for statements she has made about the new autism insurance mandates, using air quotes to describe autism and implying that perhaps these people don't deserve coverage or that autism is a trivial condition.Interestingly, secretary of health and human services Kathleen Sebelius has given her take on the matter Sebelius states:It is my understanding that Sharron Angle believes that there is a hoax, under the guise of autism, where you would include requests for treatments that may not even be required,\" said Sebelius, who was in Nevada promoting health care reform with Harry Reid.Sebelius pounded Angle's comments as \"insulting\" to parents and kids, adding: \"I don't know if there is anyplace in the country where the differences in the candidates are more stark than here.\"Autism's gadfly has questioned the value of these insurance mandates in the past, particularly covering ABA, an experimental treatment where the research has used punishment in order to get the results, in spite of the fact that these punishments have been outlawed in California, where I live and possibly other jurisdictions,  as well as the fact there have been no published adult outcomes though the federal government has funded this research to assess adult outcomes.Of greater concern, at least to this blogger, is is the strong statement by autism speaks is that these insurance mandates will make the difference between an autistic child having friends and not having friends.Aside from the problems of these insurance mandates and their dubious value it seems odd to your humble blogger that Sebelius would be making these statements in light of the fact she has appointed one Ari Ne'eman to the Interagency autism coordinating committee. Gadfly questions the constitutionality of the IACC and the fact that these appointments by the secretary of HHS would seem to violate the principles of checks and balances between the executive branch and legislative branch that this country was founded upon in that these appointments don't require confirmation by the senate and Sebelius is accountable to no one in making a controversial appointment. Speaking of quotes, air or otherwise, check out one statement by Sebelius appointee:The belief was that anyone society labeled\"disabled\" could only go so far. Sadly, these misconceptions had the potential to become self-fulfilling prophecies. When the expectation is that people of a certain type can only reach so far, they are not provided with the same challenges and opportunities that educators give mainstreamed students....Also another statement:We should recognize what diversity of neurology has contributed to the human race and what it can bring to the future. Difference is not disability and someday, I hope, the world will recognize that those who think in different ways should be welcomed.Regular readers of this blog will remember that after Ne'eman steadfastly denied that he had ever said autism was not a disability, Gadfly called Ne'eman out on these statements. He subsequently edited the essay changing the difference is not disability statement to difference only becomes disability when not accommodated for. Apparently dissatisfied with this rather pathetic attempt at damage control, Ne'eman and his ASAN cronies deleted the essay altogether from their web page.Another interesting statement from Ms. Sebelius' appointee:But if we are to demand equal legitimacy, if we are to assert that a \u201ccure\u201d is not only unnecessary and undesirable but also morally reprehensibleAgain, note the irony of the c word in quotes. Ms. Sebelius, I can't speak for whether some found Ms. Angle's comments insulting.  On the other hand, I find your appointment of Ari Ne'eman to a taxpayer funded body that mandates autism policy utterly offensive.  I find it strange that you would make these comments critical of Ms. Angle as if you really give a shit about persons on the spectrum, when you appoint someone who does not tell the truth about saying autism is not a disability and claiming that curing people of this affliction, which I presume mandated insurance would pay for if such cure existed, would be morally reprehensible.

{"date": " September 29, 2010", "body": "\nI see that Ari Ne'eman (as well as I presume the rest of the members of the autistic self advocacy network) have taken umbrage at republican senatorial candidate Sharron Angle's controversial remarks about autism and insurance mandates, where she implies that some persons may be faking autism. ASAN is now circulating an online petition urging Angle to apologize for her remarks. It seems to this blogger the majority of ASAN's advocacy activities are aimed at telling the world how easily offended they are and just trying to claim people should not be offensive rather than actually doing something to help disabled people function better in the world or fighting for abuse such as what happens at Judge Rotenberg center.  The Ransom notes campaign from a couple of years ago is the most well-known of these examples.  If everyone spent as much time crusading anytime a remark that they found offensive was said, no one would get any work done during the day and the world's activities would grind to a halt. Since Ari Ne'eman and ASAN insist that Angle apologize for remarks that they don't like how about if they apologize to me for remarks and activities that I find offensive. I find it offensive that they would state that curing autism is morally reprehensible.  That they would spend time on the Zacqhery Price case after saying that no criminal should get a free pass because of autism.  I am offended that they would claim they never said that autism was not a disability and after I produced Ne'eman's essay they would make a pathetic attempt at damage control and edit the essay, then admit it was a mistake to phrase things in the essay the way they did, then delete it from their site altogether.  I find it offensive that Ne'eman, (a 21-year-old kid at the time) had never worked in a job of any sort and would claim that the solution for reducing employment among autistics was to eliminate social pleasantry as a criteria for hiring and a good job evaluation.  This is particularly offensive after I have been fired something like 20 times, forced to resign from other jobs in more marginal situations and tried to make a living more years than Ne'eman has been alive.  I find it offensive that they would accept donations from the \"autistic bitch from hell\" who has stated that persons with autism whose views she does not agree with should be put to death and turned into cat food.  There is speculation that ABFH is in reality Meg Evans, one of the top executives of ASAN.  I find it offensive that they would accept donations from a vicious and cruel hatemonger like Clay Adams who can only try to win an argument with me by bringing back the Bettelheim era and stating my mother was responsible for all the problems in my life and making up bigoted statements mocking my disability and by extension all disabled people whom ASAN claims they want to have dignity.  As well as calling both me and my mother names just because he does not like the fact I take Ne'eman to task.   Ne'eman may not know about this since it happened before he was born but in 1980 the Ku Klux Klan endorsed Ronald Reagan's presidential candidacy and Reagan renounced the endorsement and refused to accept money from them.  I wonder why Ne'eman and ASAN don't do the same thing where ABFH and Clay Adams are concerned. I find it offensive that they would imply that there is a possibility that parents of autistic children who donate money to autism speaks are morally complicit with murder.  I find it offensive that they would imply that genetic research is used to find a way to abort autistic fetuses. I don't know how to do an online petition and I don't know how many signatures I would get.  But the various statements and actions of Ne'eman and his colleagues are just as offensive to me as Angle's statements about autism are to those who took umbrage at her remarks.  I suspect there are others besides me who find a lot of Ne'eman's and ASAN's remarks offensive.I suggest that ASAN write a public apology to me ( and anyone else they may have offended) on their websites before they start circulating petitions claiming someone who makes remarks offensive to them should apologize.

{"date": " July 19, 2010", "body": "\nAs has been written previously on autism's gadfly, this humble blogger has been interested in an answer to the question of why autism speaks would give Dr. Laurent Mottron a 3 year research grant amounting to nearly half a million dollars when he says that the ultimate goal of the organization that has given him this grant is nonsensical. and says that autism is not a brain disorder or a damaged brain but merely a difference. The grant was awarded in June 2008 and will expire in less than a year from now. Who wants to take bets that Monsieur Mottron will be asking for at least another half a million in June of 2011?One would think that being able to receive such a sizable grant from an organization whose stated goals and beliefs in autism are so different from the good doctor's own would be enough for him. However, this does not appear to be the case. If what Alan Griswold wrote on his blog and prints a letter he allegedly received from Mottron is truly from Mottron as he claims, then it would seem this paragon of virtue from the point of view of the neurodiversity movement wants much more than to renew his triannual 500K grant.Mottron allegedly writes:I see three alternative ways to change a damaging system/ideology: fight it directly, build something else which is more convincing, or lastly, become the head of this system, then change it. I would call the last one the gorbachevian position. Whereas I used the first two ways at various levels (specially in our clinical organization, and in various influences we have as policy makers in Quebec), I chose the third way for science.It would seem that Laurent Mottron would like to do something equivalent of a military coup of a third world nation and become its dictator. In fact, he may not mean autism speaks but the whole scientific establishment and its funding worldwide.I am curious as to what parents think, whose children risk death from elopement, can't speak, and bang their heads and self-injure themselves who went on walks and fundraisers for autism speaks would think if this man whose research subjects as a general rule have nothing in common with their children were to be in charge of the whole organization of autism speaks.How realistic is Dr. Mottron's ambition? What chance does he have of being able to take over autism speaks and/or influence scientific policy so every single scientist has a neurodiversity perspective? Given the fact our government has passed the combating autism act, stating that cure and prevention of autism are the law of the land and the Canadian government likely has a similar policy and most persons with an interest in autism regard the ND movement as nothing more than a fringe group with no more credibility than the flat earth society, it would seem Dr. Mottron does not have much chance of accomplishing this goal.Perhaps there is a reason for this. I am reminded of the word\"megalomania\". Though this is not a medical diagnosis of any sort, there are persons for whom this layterm is attributed to who have grandoise delusions. Is there evidence that Dr. Mottron could possibly have a state of mind that would lead him to believe that he had a chance of taking over autism speaks or in fact be in charge of all scientific research everywhere in the world? We have only to look at a wired magazine article that was written about Dr. Mottron, Michelle Dawson, a woman with autism who works in his research group, and Amanda Baggs. The article states:One of the leading researchers here is Laurent Mottron, 55, a psychiatrist specializing in autism. Mottron, who grew up in postwar France, had a tough childhood. His family had a history of schizophrenia and Tourette syndrome, and he probably has what today would be diagnosed as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.So we see there is a history of mental illness in Mottron's family which could possibly lead to a genetic predisposition to grandoise delusions. He also states that he possibly himself has attention deficit disorder.For those who are claiming that I am making a libelous statement about Dr. Mottron or even that I am engaging in an ad hominem attack against the doctor, I will clarify. This is not to say that Dr. Mottron necessarily has a mental condition that has caused him to believe that autism is not a defect of the brain but merely a difference and even that autism is a harmless condition. However, as a person who has an autism spectrum disorder, who can't work, has very limited social relations, let alone being able to marry, can't concentrate, can't get things done during the day and longs for an answer using science as to what caused this condition as well as the best available treatments, including a cure, I believe I have a right to answer some pertinent questions. Would a rational thinking person go to medical school and then graduate school obtain a ph.d., specialize in a certain disease and then say this condition is only a difference? I don't believe this is the case. Would someone capable of rational thought believe that they could become the head of an entire organization and then just change the organization's way of thinking? I believe I have the right to question the soundness of mind of a person who is receiving money in a process in which I am a stakeholder.Dr. Mottron's factotum, Michelle Dawson, has given me a simple explanation for why the group should accept funding from autism speaks and autism speaks should award them lucrative grants. \"Science isn't politics\". I must disagree with Ms. Dawson. Research scientists whether they work in autism, cancer research or other endeavors involving medical conditions do so because persons want to cure diseases. They are not funded so they can pay their mortgages and amuse themselves. The federal government is already involved with autism issues with just the creation and the passage of the CAA and the creation of the IACC alone. This in itself makes science a political issue. Therefore, as a stakeholder I have a right to question a researcher's political statements.In the same vein, I believe that I have a right to question a doctor's fitness to practice medicine and/or receive funding for scientific research based on a possible mental condition and/or state of mind which might influence the direction of their research when I am a stakeholder. It is in this spirit that this blog post is written, not to diagnosis him with any sort of mental disorder or soundness of mind which would cause him to have such irrational beliefs and statements, particularly from a medical doctor whose job is usually to alleviate suffering and provide remedies for conditions such as autism.In the meantime, as a psychiatrist, perhaps Dr. Mottron could look at himself objectively and think about the old saw, 'physician heal thyself'.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticaphorisms.blogspot.com/2009/09/laurent-mottrons-reply.html", "http://east.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/megalomaniac", "http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-03/ff_autism?currentPage=3"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/07/laurent-mottron-in-charge-of-autism.html", "title": "\nLaurent Mottron in charge of autism speaks?\n"},
{"date": " June 22, 2011", "body": "\nAnother study by the Simon Baron-Cohen research group has been getting some media attention today.  I read this media report this morning.  Curiosity piqued, I tried to find the primary source for this, but unfortunately it had been behind a pay wall.  In the comments section of my previous post, a reader asked me for my take on the study and stated that he/she was able to download it for free. I gave them my take from what I had read in the media reports before reading the actual study.  I was wondering if it were still behind the paywall.  Skeptical, I tried again, and sure enough, I was able to download the entire study and read it.  My comment was short and I feel the study deserves a post all its own.  Baron-Cohen in the past has made the bold statements and strong hypothesis that autism genes are responsible for so-called systemetizers and this is why autism has stayed in the general population in spite of the fact that autistics seldom have children.  He seems to have gone further and intimated that my suffering may be necessary to society. I have taken him to task for this elsewhere. Martine Roelfesema and Simon Baron-Cohen and a few other authors have recently published a study in JADD, suggesting that autism may be much more prevalent in areas of the Netherlands where a concentration of IT companies such as Philips and IBM are based.  They surveyed three different metropolitan areas of Holland and found prevalence rates 3-4 times as high in the area with high tech companies than in the other two cities.  They suggested that genes responsible for systematization may be responsible for this. Superficially, this study is interesting and makes good fodder for journalists looking for an intriguing story about autism and its alleged gifts.  However, on closer analysis and reading, it would appear the study has some limitations and possible flaws. While the CDC in the American prevalence studies have found great differences in prevalence in various parts of the country, it would appear that Arizona which has one of the highest prevalence rates does not have industries that would employ so-called systemetizers.  I don't know whether this is true in New Jersey or not. There are also great variations in prevalences in various parts of California according to past CDDS data.  Though the Silicone Valley has higher rates than rural parts of California it is substantially lower than in Los Angeles, which would refute Baron-Cohen and company's notion about there being a casual relationship between technology abilities in parents and autistic offspring. Variations in prevalence in Holland would be far less likely due to differences in income, population density, socioeconomic status as the country is far more homogeneous in its population than the U.S. Recruitment in the study was voluntary.  Only a bit more than half the schools who were asked to survey consented.  The response rate was substantially higher for the high prevalence group than the other two areas.   Weighting factors that I concede I don't understand were used to supposedly eliminate this bias, but I'm still skeptical.    The response rates from special ed schools was much higher than mainstream schools.  The age range of kids surveyed was 4-16.  In one of the two control communities, the prevalence rate was about the same in the older kids than in the younger kids.  In the other two communities it was much higher as later diagnosis was included.  This could have influenced the results of the study.  The diagnoses were not verified, though this may have been infeasible. Most germane of all, the Baron-Cohen group did not control for persons moving into the high prevalence area because of the possibility of better services, etc. so this might invalidate the findings.  There may be other issues in the study that I will think of and I might go in and edit this post later if I can think of them. This stuff also interests me, because, as regular readers of my blog know, my father was a pioneer in the computer industry, and I wondered if his genes somehow caused my autism.  However, there seems to be a more pertinent history from my mother's family than from my father's, as I had a very depressed maternal grandmother and her brother (my great uncle) was likely to have been an undiagnosed autistic in the very early 1900s.  Though neither my sister nor any of my first cousins on my mother's side have autism, there seems to be a high rate of dyslexia and ADHD amongst them, which would be far higher than the occurrence of chance. Baron-Cohen has also stated (though I can't recall exactly where) that it is possible that males who were good systematizers might have been unable to find a mate at one time and with the advent of the IT revolution and silicone valley this might no longer be a problem and two engineers and programmers would be likely to marry and produce an autistic offspring.  This does not jive with the personal experience of my father and the men whom he worked with going back to the early 1950s, before a big computer revolution and increase in autism prevalence.  My dad and I'm pretty sure all of these systemetizers he worked with were able to marry and produce children.  I'm pretty sure none of their wives were engineers or worked in the IT profession (this includes my mom of course) and with the exception of one individual from England who had a daughter who was either severely retarded or autistic, I don't think any of the other engineers and computer people dad worked with had children that were on the autistic spectrum. The currently published study is only phase I.  They state that phase II of the study which will in part address some of the issues I have discussed in this post are forthcoming.  I will await it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43497742/ns/health-mental_health/", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/06/baron-cohen-it-autism-prevelance-study.html", "title": "\nBaron-Cohen IT autism prevelance study: some comments\n"},
{"date": " April 8, 2010", "body": "\nI have been reading this gem from Sarah Pripas, ASAN board member, leader of ASAN's UCLA chapter and neurodiversity activist. One of the talking points that got my attention was:In the public policy arena, pro-neurodiversity organizations are, with our limited budgets, doing our best to improve disability policy. Here I feel compelled to speak about Autism Speaks, an organization which is worth tens of billions of dollars, yet has done comparatively little to address the practical needs of autistic people.A billion dollars seems like an unfathomable amount of money to me for a charitable organization to have let alone tens of billions of dollars. I realize that Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have this much cash on hand. I realize there might be some huge corporations that have this kind of money, but not very many I would think. Of course, I realize this is a drop in the bucket for what the federal government spends every year, on defense, entitlement programs, government employee's salaries, etc. But it did seem farfetched to me that autism speaks could conceivably have this kind of dough.In order to factcheck Ms. Pripas' assertion, I came across this webpage from the better business bureau which discusses the actual assets of AS as of the end of 2008.  It would seem to contradict Ms. Pripas' bold statement.  I will paste the figures from this webpage. For the year ended December 31, 2008, AS's program expenses were:Research36,586,500Awareness and other services19,363,917Total Program Expenses:$55,950,417 Back To Top Governance              Chief Executive : Mark Roithmayr, PresidentCompensation*:$400,413Highest Paid Executive: Geri Dawson, Chief Science OfficerCompensation*: $669,751Financial              The following information is based on AS's audited financial statements (consolidated) for the year ended December 31, 2008:Walk program and retail partners34,017,852Major gifts and other contributions25,812,625Special and community events8,199,054Government grants1,754,364Interest income318,038-->Total Income-->$70,101,933Total income$70,101,933Program expenses$55,950,417Fund raising expenses15,732,997Administrative expenses2,960,474Total expenses$74,643,888Expenses in Excess of Income(4,541,955)Beginning net assets14,269,556Ending net assets9,727,601Total liabilities19,883,915Total assets$29,611,516We see that in the year 2008 autism speaks earned a bit over 70 million and spent nearly 75 million incurring more liabilities than assets in that year.We see that at the end of 2008 they had nearly 30 million in assets against just under 20 million dollars in liabilities. as of December 2008, their net assets were less than 10 million dollars. Certainly a far cry from Pripas' tens of billions of dollars.  Where Ms. Pripas obtains her figures I have not one iota.  Ms. Pripas also neglects to take into account that her neurodiversity movement conned autism speaks into giving Laurent Mottron a grant that is worth approximately 5% of what were autism speaks' net assets as of about a year ago.  Of course AS may have become more healthy in the past year financially, but that seems implausible.  Certainly that they were ever worth tens of billions of dollars is a huge stretch to say the least.Anyone who read this post can correct me in the comments section if I am mistaken but I believe Ms. Pripas is at least on the board of ASAN as well as the leader of their UCLA chapter.  Though somewhat lower than Ari Ne'eman in stature, I think she does have a high executive position in the organization. Yet, this organization who has on its board of directors a person who would make such a gross misstatement of fact, certainly reflects on Ne'eman himself.  So perhaps the U.S. Senate could look at this and see just who Obama is proposing to the NDC.  Someone who has an axe to grind against an organization that is admittedly far from perfect, yet does have as its goal the curation of autism and wanting to help persons on the spectrum lead better lives until a cure is available.  Though I have bones of contention with their funding of Mottron, the autism in the workplace dog and pony show and other issues, they are certainly funding some scientific research that at some point will hopefully help handicapped persons with this condition better function in the world. So far, ASAN had produced nothing of importance.  Also, should an organization that would make such a huge clusterfuck in presenting their 'facts' be in control of disability policy in Washington?  I think not.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.asanla.blogspot.com/", "http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/human-services/autism-speaks-in-new-york-ny-1456", "http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/human-services/autism-speaks-in-new-york-ny-1456#"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/04/asan-board-members-strange-take-on.html", "title": "\nASAN board member's strange take on autism speaks\n"},
{"date": " March 30, 2010", "body": "\nWell autism's gadfly has now reached a milestone of sorts as I write my 200th post on this blog. As the hot topic of the anonymous senator(s) who have had the good common sense to put a hold on Ari Ne'eman's appointment gets hotter, I have a very good subject for my 200th post. I see a new facebook page urging Ne'eman's confirmation to the NDC has been created by some of his allies. These people are working, urging Ne'eman's confirmation to the NDC.Some character called Jeremy Block, one of the most prolific posters on this group, was nice enough to give me and my previous post on here about the senate hold on Ne'eman's appointment a mention and a link on the facebook page; I am glad because it makes me know I am making an impact regardless of the outcome of Ne'eman's appointment. This person stated that I undermined my own credibility because in one short segment of the post (and one post out of multiple posts dealing with Ne'eman's pending appointment) I mentioned Ne'eman's association with hatemongers Harry Williams and Clay Adams, stating that we could judge him by the company he keeps. Though I made a brief mention of these individuals Block claimed my post was about them rather than Ne'eman. Naturally Block had no arguments against the very solid evidence that I have provided that Ne'eman definitely at one time (and probably to this day) does not believe autism or Asperger's are disabilities yet desires to serve on a disabilities council. He has no argument about why someone who does not want people cured of their sickness when the combating autism act has been passed which has as its aim the curation of autism, should serve in any government post dealing with autism. He has no argument about why someone who has never worked and is so ignorant of the problems of persons on the spectrum have in the workplace that they say this can be solved by eliminating social pleasantry as a criteria for hiring should be on a government council that in part deals with policies to help disabled people obtain employment.Though I believe Ne'eman's association with vicious bullies is a legitimate talking point, this was just one minor point in the multiple arguments I have given against Ne'eman's confirmation and Block was trying to make out like I was making this the main argument.Even worse than Block were two individuals, Zoey Roberts and Chelsea Boon who weighed in. These young ladies only made comments attacking me and did not even bother to refute any of my facts arguing against Ne'eman's confirmation. Ms. Roberts stated that I was a known troublemaker and lumped me in with the infamous John Best. Ms. Boon stated that she did not feel sorry for me and that nothing I did was good enough for myself and I made no effort to self-improve.Since they saved me the trouble of having to readdress actual arguments favoring Ne'eman's appointment, given there is no legitimate argument for allowing Ne'eman to serve I will address their personal attacks briefly.Apparently Ms. Roberts' definition of a troublemaker is someone who actually has the temerity to refute the hatred and lies and propaganda that neurodiversity espouses regularly on the internet. If that makes me a troublemaker so be it. Apparently someone who expresses agreement with them is not a troublemaker only someone with an opposing viewpoint.Ms. Boon who has never met me, knows nothing about me has taken it upon herself to judge me and my character. She does not know how hard I tried to make a living for nearly 3 decades, what it was like being canned from jobs and having to start all over again, having the phony government intervention in the California state department of rehabilitation (which Ne'eman naively promotes) shaft me and all of the other abuse I had to endure. I can certainly say I tried very hard, took coursework in medical transcription, computer repair, programming in order to better myself. But making ad hominem and specious arguments out of ignorance is par for the course for neurodiversity. This is one of the main reasons I oppose Ne'eman's appointment. Contrary to Ms. Boon's baloney I have spent more years making an effort to improve myself and make a living than Ne'eman has been alive. Again, anyone who would make the absurd statement from a figurative ivory tower that the solution to autistic unemployment is to eliminate social pleasantry as a criteria for hiring certainly has no understanding of the problems in the workplace that someone like me faces. They are totally unsuited and unqualified for the top government position in disability policy guidance. I never asked Ms. Boon or anyone else to feel sorry for me and if she feels being able to make a living, not being celibate and having good motor coordination and not being forced to self-stimulate all the time and being able to get things done other than some blog posts I write is asking for too much that is her problem not mine.I see from looking at these profiles that two of these people are still students at a university. I suspect, like Ne'eman, they have only lived an ivory tower existence and are ignorant of the world of work, so I suppose their supporting Ne'eman is par for the course.Well congrats to autism's gadfly for the milestone 200th post!Addendum: Again I have written to senators Boxer and Feinstein, in light of these new developments, urging them to reject confirming Ne'eman to the post.Second Addendum: If anyone looks at the link to the ne'eman facebook page and is curious as to why the personal attacks, Ms. Roberts and Ms. Boon leveled against me are absent, the reason is that Mr. Block deleted them and then wrote the following to me:If the author is reading this, I am sorry you felt it necessary to write about me in such a negative way in your blog. ... See MoreI'm glad you care deeply about the issues you write about. If you are looking for some kind of argument escalation on the issue, you won't get it from me and it is my hope you will not get it from anyone else in this group.Yesterday at 8:25pmBut you can believe they were actually there at one time.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/gerald.newport?ref=mf#!/group.php?gid=108956302461753&ref=mf"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/03/200th-gadfly-post-ari-neeman-facebook.html", "title": "\n200th Gadfly post-Ari Ne'eman facebook support group\n"},
{"date": " May 4, 2010", "body": "\nIn the people throwing stones from houses made out of fragile glass department, I just read an interesting post from well known neurodiversity blogger Amanda Baggs. She talks about how two stellar individuals from the neurodiversity movement, Kowalski, and Sadder but wiser girl have closed down their blogs due to bullying. Amanda neglects to go into the specifics, but implies there was stalking and death threats. I am also reminded of Kevin Leitch, owner of the left brain/right brain blog who closed LB/RB for a brief time, when the infamous John Best spent time being his daughter's sockpuppet with a \"daddy please cure me\" thing, who is another example of an ND blogger who did something similar but not cited by Amanda. We have to wonder if the old cliche hate begets hate applies here.  The first time I had heard of Sadder but Wiser girl, she was writing about how much dissatisfaction she had with your humble blogger's beliefs that autism should be cured, nonverbal autistics should be able to speak.  She also went on to compare me to a Jew who helped the Nazis during the holocaust and claimed I was the type who would gladly jump in a crematorium.  Kowalski, one half of the Kowalski and Turner duo, wrote a blog post about how parents who support autism speaks and want a cure for autism are like members of the Ku Klux Klan who are forced to raise black children. Sadder but Wiser girl commented how much she agreed with K &T on this point, so in addition to believing that I am like a Jew who helps the nazis, she also believes that parents of autistic children who support autism speaks and want a cure for their children are like KKK members forced to raise black children.   Though Amanda is quite vague about the specifics, we have to wonder if whatever bullying these two August bloggers have received, alleged or otherwise, was maybe due to such harsh criticism of individuals who either want a better life or want to improve the life of their children.Amanda certainly knows about bullying.  She is one of the owners of the web page autistics.org who implied that the now defunct organization Cure Autism Now only had as their goal the development of a prenatal test so that autistic fetuses could be aborted with her nasty cartoon with the autistic fetus in a trashcan with the letters CAN written on it and the caption, \"The real meaning of autism prevention\".  Amanda has billed her organization as the real voice of autism. Neurodiversity complaining about bullying is absurd as the majority of them are incredible bullies themselves.  In addition to SBWG's comments about me, I have had my parents insulted, I have been mocked and ridiculed and libeled.  One nasty blogger even went so far as to write a libelous post claiming I was at an autism dinner and looked up Portia Iversen's dress and became so enamored, I immediately became a traitor to the autistic rights movement.  I have had people use me as a sock puppet and forge my name to saying certain things.  I have been cussed out and ridiculed by one stellar individual who also said that I should become the homosexual bed partner of another anti-ND blogger and go to a state where homosexuals can legally marry.  Phil Gluyas also created a blog Mitchell's gadfly, just directed to me where he and his friends would constantly insult me.  When he realized he could not shut me up, he finally closed down Mitchell's gadfly. I am proud to say in spite of all this abuse I have endured, I have not closed down autism's gadfly.  I am proud to be one of the few voices on the internet to speak out against this ugly cult called neurodiversity. It seems as if neurodiversity wants to dish it out they should be able to take it.  Just shows what a pathetic movement they really are.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=627"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/05/neurodiversity-hatemongers-dish-it-out.html", "title": "\nneurodiversity hatemongers dish it out can't take it\n"},
{"date": " March 17, 2010", "body": "\nWell more bad news on the autism advocacy front is that Ari Ne'eman is one step closer to clinching his nomination to the National Disabilities Council. His nomination has now been approved by a senate committee, who likely knows nothing about neurodiversity, and will go forward to the complete senate for a most likely inevitable confirmation. As I have written previously Ne'eman is being appointed to a council with the word Disabilities in it, though I have provided evidence that Ne'eman most likely does not even believe that autism or Asperger's (which he has) is a disability. I have previously written about the essay where Ne'eman changed the wording of his difference does not equal disability statement to difference is only disability when not accommodated for, which the interested reader can verify by following the preceding link. I expressed regrets that I did not take a screen shot of the original essay. One of my readers who does not like neurodiversity any more than I do sent me what he said was a screen shot of the essay as it originally appeared before Ne'eman edited it. I am not sure how to print this on blogger and I am not sure it is worth the effort and trouble to find out how and print this. What he also sent me was another example where Ne'eman stated that Asperger's syndrome, which he has, isn't a disability. Ne'eman stated:I happened to stumble upon your entry on a Yahoo Search for Asperger's and I'm glad I did. As a teen with Asperger's, I strongly suggest you tell your son as soon as possible. The fact is he is different. What's more, this is not a bad thing. Any individual who accomplishes anything is different. It's his right and his requirement to know who he is, and what makes him different from those around him. Furthermore,Asperger's Syndrome is hardly what one would think of as a disability. I recommend you take a look at Norm Ledgin's \"Diagnosing Jefferson\", a wonderful book that suggests that one of the founders of our nation had Asperger's. As I and the book can attest, it is not in spite of but because of the characteristics that set us apart from others that \"Aspies\", as the popular nickname goes, have the ability to do great things.The day will come when Asperger's will be recognized for what it truly is: a difference, not a disability, and in many ways an advantage. I think you owe it to your son to talk to him about who he is and help him succeed as that person, not pretend (or worse yet, force him to pretend) to be someone else. I'm somewhat notably successful for my age and as a result I've occasionally been asked to speak to newly diagnosed \"Aspies\" and at a few conferences about Asperger's and special education in general. One of the things I've always tried to stress is the vital importance of recognizing the advantages of difference and not falling into the trap so many do that different is defective.It is possible that one of the reasons that Ne'eman was appointed to this position by the Obama administration was his claim that he himself is a stakeholder as a disabled person as per his 'nothing about us without us' mantra. But Ne'eman has stated that he has Asperger's. In this statement which I have printed out and the link that I have provided, we see evidence that Ne'eman (at least at one time) did not even believe that Asperger's was a disability ergo not believing that he himself is a disabled person serving on the disabilities council, so why wouldn't it be deceptive advertising if he has presented himself as a disabled person before the U.S. Senate, claiming he deserves to be a stakeholder alongside nondisabled person on the council? One interesting sidenote is that Ne'eman trivializes the angst of autism spectrum disorders by claiming that Thomas Jefferson was one of us. I believe I have debunked that notion elsewhere. I have written both of my U.S. Senators urging them not to confirm Ne'eman to the post, but there is nothing else more that I can do. I suspect Ne'eman will be appointed and there is nothing I can do about it. It is very clear that Ne'eman has stated that he believes autism and Asperger's are not disabilities in the past. I think it is less likely he will be able to go into this post and edit it though as he was able to edit his essay after I called him out on it. He will now state that he believes autism is a disability for political reasons. What is more significant though is that Ne'eman will perpetuate the myth that autism is no great tragedy as he did in that PSA soundbite ironically titled 'No myths'. He will give quick fix simplistic solutions such as claiming that autistics can be fully employed if social pleasantry is eliminated as a criteria for hiring. As some of my readers know I have been trying to get on SSDI for nearly 3 years. If anyone at all takes Ne'eman (or anyone else from the warped ND movement for that matter) seriously. People in goverment won't see autism as a problem. This means we won't get the help we need. There are some persons who have never worked such as friends Roger Kulp and Stephanie Keil who receive SSI. What if someone had listened to Ne'eman or another like-minded member of the NDC. Is it possible these two individuals would have been denied their benefits and would have to live in even more extreme poverty than they do now? Will the NDC be able to influence the direction scientific research goes in? This means that genetic research in autism will not be funded if Ne'eman has his way, something that could help future generations of autistics. Does this mean we will lose a diminished capacity defense if someone commits what would be a crime for a typical person due to having autistic symptomatology. If Ne'eman preaches what he did in his equality means responsibility essay, then the answer is yes. Will our prisons and institutions be packed with even more ASD persons whose behavior they might not be able to help due to their disability. Of course, Ne'eman will say that Zackery (sp??) Price should get a free pass for some reason in spite of what he wrote in his essay. Though Ne'eman usually tries to be polite, does this mean that certain neurodiversity members such as the very nasty Harry Williams (AKA Socrates) and the nasty Marc Rosen who enjoys insulting my mother and trying to bring back the Bettelheim era as Clay Adams, Phil Gluyas and some of the more extreme vicious members of club ND have tried to do will be given a license to insult and abuse others. Will Ne'eman only try to maintain the failed status quo as he has in the past by supporting full federal funding of the IDEA? Does this mean same old, same old from NDC and other government bodies? Does this mean the end of medicaid waivers for those with autism if it is no longer considered a disability and Ne'eman's equality means responsibility mantra extends for people providing for their own medical care as well as not being given a free pass for criminal behavior?Only time will tell after Ne'eman's appointment is inevitably confirmed by the entire body of the U.S. Senate. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/03/senate-committee-approves-nominations-for-national-council-on-disability/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+LeftBrain%2FrightBrain+%28Left+Brain%2FRight+Brain%29", "http://www.parentdish.com/2005/09/26/aspergers-syndrome-how-do-you-tell-your-child-he-has/#comment", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/undiagnosing.html#Thomas%20Jefferson"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/03/ari-neemanone-step-closer-to.html", "title": "\nAri Ne'eman:One step closer to confirmation\n"},

He wrote a comment inquiring about this. He wrote another follow-up comment stating that a whopping 15 persons from ASAN showed up to demonstrate against the fundraiser according apparently to a twitter feed that ASAN has. However in what seems to me to be a strange take on the matter, ASAN member Marc Rosen called the protest a successWe can see one of them being rather antagonistic to Mr. Seinfeld:We see in a recent update from AS that they managed to raise 1.7 million dollars from this gala event, in spite of the 15 ASAN protestors.Anyone remember the old philosophical question about if a tree falls in the forest a thousand miles away from anyone does it make a sound?Addendum: I pointed out to ASAN's Marc Rosen that they were only 15 persons as opposed to the 1.7 million that AS manage to raise from this event and the lack of sound from a tree no one hears being analogous to how effective their protest was, as well as their inconsistencies in supporting Laurent Mottron when he accepted funding from AS, yet instead of protesting Dr. Mottron, they have lauded the research of he and his associates that the organization they protest fundraises. I believe this is an inconsistency. Rosen responded by stating that if I had nothing useful to say that he would delete my comments and that I should save it for my blog and overbearing mother.So we see, again ASAN is an organization like other ND proponents who are trying to bring back the Bettelheim era, having to stoop to insulting one's mother because they have nothing productive to say and can't refute anything I say. Marc Rosen is so typical of the ND movement, just engaging in censorship of anyone who posts a comment they disagree with.

{"date": " November 25, 2009", "body": "\nAs regular readers of this blog know, in my last post before this I wrote about ASAN's latest protest against Autism Speaks latest fundraiser in NYC, questioning on what impact they may or may n0t have had on AS. I also wrote about Marc Rosen's interesting take that ASAN's demonstration was a success. I commented on the inconsistencies of neurodiversity's claiming that no one should support autism speaks by donating money to them or in Jerry Seinfeld's case, performing as an entertainer for them to help them raise funds, yet having no problem at all accepting the half a million dollar grant that their scientific representative Laurent Mottron and his factotum Michelle Dawson received. Michelle Dawson's response to why she continued to work with the Mottron group and other AS funded researchers was \"science isn't politics\". I thought this was an absurd response. However, now, it seems quite sane compared to a response some character named \"Charles\" made on Marc Rosen's comments section in his blog or examiner article or whatever it was. Charles responds to my query as follows:We condemn Autism Speaks because of its overall position and actions. We -- neurodiversity/autistic rights advocates, or whatever you want to call us -- do not condemn 100% of what Autism Speaks does. To do so would be very difficult to defend and indicative of prejudice. No organization, not even the worst of them, is 100% bad. Acknowledging such is not hypocrisy or a conflict of interests. Any monies channeled through Autism Speaks never belonged to them in the first place. It's charity, grants, etc., raised on the backs of Autistic people, and as such, it is rightfully OURS to direct as we see fit. If Autism Speaks sometimes happens to direct some of that money to the right places, (which places are right is a separate issue), our position against Autism Speaks does not require that we condemn that. If Autism Speaks did not exist, those who deserve funding would still get it. Autism Speaks does not create money; they merely GATHER it.What does Charles mean by \"ours\"? Does he mean all autistic persons on the planet, myself included? Then does he have a right to speak for me? It sort of is reminiscent of Harold Doherty's concept of the royal we. Assuming there has been no increase in prevalence in autism and there are more autistic adults than children, we can still presume that perhaps as many of one-third of autistic persons have not reached their majority and legally their parents can make monetary and other decisions for them. Does this include them? Does this include nonverbal autistic adults such as John Belmonte who are not in a position to communicate how this money is spent, possibly others who may be under a conservatorship? However, since Alex Plank, Dawn Prince-Hughes, Michael John Carley and others have claimed that \"most autistics don't want to be cured\" when there is no evidence whatsoever to back up that contention, does Charles speak for all or most autistics or is he speaking for neurodiversity? Or perhaps more specifically he is speaking for ASAN. He seems to think that all of the millions of assets of autism speaks. Perhaps even the multimillion dollar fortune of Bob and Suzanne Wright themselves belongs to ND or maybe even just ASAN to spend as they see fit.One can even delve further into the matter by examining whether just because the word \"autistic\" is used in fundraising whether or not this even applies to persons like Ari Ne'eman, Marc Rosen or Charles.  Before there were changes in the diagnostic criteria for autism Ari Ne'eman would not have been diagnosed as having autism since he had no speech delay and was in fact able to name various types of dinosaurs at age two.  Had there been no change.  Ne'eman's diagnosis would still be ADHD.  Most of the parents and others who are involved with autism speaks have persons whose clinical picture is most likely different from Ne'eman's and other ASAN members.  They are persons who are (or were at one time) nonverbal.  Can't care for themselves and have problems that are not like probably most ND advocates.  In spite of Ne'eman's slogan, nothing about us without us, the things that AS fundraises are probably not about him and other ND's so perhaps an argument could be made that there is nothing wrong with it being done without him and his ilk.  So perhaps the collective \"ours\" does not even apply to Charles and whomever else he is referring to.I still remember the statement of one of my readers, Roger Kulp, who stated that Neurodiversity wanted to take over autism speaks by infiltration and a smile comes to my face. Is Charles recommending that neurodiversity engage in some sort of 1917 style Bolshevik revolution where there is a communist takeover of AS and they can just take the assets of autism speaks as the communist thugs in Russia did with the Czar's fortune? Does he believe that the federal government has a duty to seize the assets of autism speaks and give it to Ari Ne'eman and himself and others? Sort of like Robin Hood perhaps. The statement certainly smacks of communism and all of the atrocities that have happened in Lenin's or Stalin's Russia or other iron curtain countries, or in Red China, where everything belongs to \"the people\".Particularly intriguing is his statement that autism speaks does not create money, they gather it. Then aside from the U.S. government, who else creates money in the U.S. (excluding illegal counterfeiters of course)? This means Microsoft, IBM, Union oil and Bank of America and even the mom and pop grocery store down the street gather money. So, does this money just belong to the people who voluntarily did business with those places?The Wrights worked hard to obtain their capital and to build autism speaks as well as the mergers with CAN and NAAR. Even though there may have been misleading advertising on autism speaks' part to obtain the funds, as far as I can tell they did nothing illegal. All of the persons who donated money, went on walks or went to the Seinfeld/Springstein event did so voluntarily. Why does not autism speaks have the right to spend the money how they see fit? If anyone does not like how autism speaks spends their money, they don't have to donate or accept services provided by AS funds or a scientist does not have to accept funding from AS either. I doubt that Charles or any of his other collective \"ours\" whomever that might be has donated a dime to AS.Where does Charles (and possibly other ASAN members) get the idea that the money somehow belongs to a certain collective of persons, apparently as far as I can tell the ND movement and no one else? I wonder if any readers of autism's gadfly agree with Charles that the assets of autism speaks rightfully belong to neurodiversity or ASAN. In my opinion they do not. However, I welcome others opinion on the matter.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/11/do-autism-speaks-assets-belong-to.html", "title": "\nDo Autism Speaks' assets belong to neurodiversity or ASAN?\n"},
{"date": " August 26, 2009", "body": "\nI see from reading the latest entry in the the whose planet is it anyway blog that the autism bitch from hell is giving a shout out to an article written by Senator Dick Durbin, extolling the virtues of employing people with disabilities. Durbin,one of the senators who introduced the autism treatment acceleration act bill, also touches in large part on the employment problems of persons on the autism spectrum. He discusses an internship program for autistic persons that the McClean autism society started. While this effort may be laudable, I will await whether or not it results in fruition, i.e. enables the interns to obtain paid jobs anywhere. This may be equivalent to the lip service that autism speaks gives in their recent dog and pony show.Durbin, as is typical, rattles off the grim statistics of the high unemployment rate of persons with disabilities and how we typically will end up living in poverty. He seems to think the Americans with disabilities act will automatically solve the unemployment problems of those with disabilities. He then gives some statistics on how disabled people who did work did not have costly accommodations and took less sick leave off. He neglects to mention what jobs they were and what the disabilities of these people were.Most interestingly of all, Durbin delves into the problems specifically of autistics in the work place. He starts off by citing Pulitzer prize winner Tim Page who found out he had Asperger's syndrome well into adulthood. He then goes on to cite Nobel prize winner Vernon Smith as an example of someone with autism and how his autism enables him to think outside the box. There is no evidence whatsoever that Smith has an ASD of any kind. He has never been diagnosed by any clinician. He only decided well into his 60s, based on a self-administered test that he was on spectrum and diagnosed himself on this basis. No one it seems but your humble blogger has the temerity to question Smith's self- diagnosis.Durbin goes on to state that psychologists have noticed a high cluster of persons with Asperger's wherever there are high tech companies. He provides no evidence of this. Statistics from the California department of developmental services may in part dispute this. In the state's 21 regional centers, the San Andreas regional center, which serves the highly technical silicone valley to be 9th out of 21 in prevalence. Concentrations in Los Angeles are much higher than in the area of San Jose California or Sunnyvale California.Durbin then goes on to steal Michelle Dawson's and Tyler Cowen's thunder by posthumously diagnosing Alan Turing with autism.He then goes on to quote some statements that Vernon Smith has about the struggle for disability rights. As I am skeptical (to say the least) of Smith having a true disability of any kind, I don't believe he has the right to speak for me. Someone who was never able to get a ph.d., never went to a mainstream school until age 14 (excepting one private school from which I was expelled after a half a semester at age 12), who has struggled to work in medical transcription and other even more menial jobs, let alone become a college professor who can win a Nobel prize, I resent Smith talking about what it is like for people with disabilities and struggles for \"civil rights\" He has no idea what someone who is truly developmentally disabled (even relatively mildly like myself) has to go through.Durbin can pontificate until doomsday about the importance of hiring autistic people for jobs. But it is not helpful to imply that the only reason autistics can't make a living as well as nondisabled persons is due to discrimination, not giving them accommodations or lack of equal opportunity. While I don't deny that discrimination and some prejudice are a factor, a large part of the problem is that most (though I admit not all) persons on the spectrum are too disabled to learn highly skilled jobs that are in high demand. To become, doctors, lawyers, plumbers, etc. Though there are some computer programmers on the spectrum, it is a myth to claim that some sort of autism gene is responsible for great IT skills and that it is a given that most autistics could become highly paid computer specialists.As far as more menial jobs are concerned, a number of autistics may have trouble at those as well. Even if they did not have trouble at them, discrimination is an issue. If they don't like someone's behavior, it is not hard to find a replacement for them in the menial jobs in which there is a huge supply of a worker's pool and relatively low demand. This may suck, but it is certainly a reality and claiming that discrimination can just be wiped out easily is not a reality.This comes from someone who has an ASD with nearly 28 years of on and off experience in the workplace, having applied for hundreds of jobs, having a variety of different jobs, some for less than a week, a few for a couple of years or more. I have seen first hand from my own experiences how autism has impeded my ability to learn things and to acquire good skills for the job market. I have seen first hand how behavioral quirks I have had have lead to discrimination from employers and caused me to be fired.What are Durbin's true experiences with autism and other disabilities? One thing I wonder is the neglect of Senator Durbin to comment on how many disabled interns work in his office or how many paid staff members with disabilities he has working for him. As a United States Senator   Mr. Durbin most likely not only has interns who work for him but also paid staff members. The fact that he neglects to mention even one example of a disabled person in general or a person with autism in particular in his essay who is in his employ makes me believe that he is just like autism speaks in giving lip service to employing persons with autism. As is the case with autism speaks, Mr. Durbin seems to forget that charity begins at home.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2009/08/senator-dick-durbin-urges-employers-to.html", "http://jfactivist.typepad.com/jfactivist/2009/08/senator-durbin-speaks-on-ada-disability-employment-and-disability-rights-as-civil-rights.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/08/dick-durbins-quick-fix-for-autistic.html", "title": "\nDick Durbin's quick fix for autistic unemployment\n"},
{"date": " August 5, 2009", "body": "\nLast night, Tuesday at 8:00 p.m. Eastern daylight savings time, a man entered a gym in the vicinity of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. He walked into a room where a \"Latin impact\" aerobics class was being held. He turned out the lights and drew a gun out of his gym bag. He started shooting, killing three women and then killing himself. This story is already getting media attention. Apparently, the man was frustrated by the fact that he was 48 years old and had not had a girlfriend for a long time. In fact he kept a detailed online diary describing his frustrations and his plan to go out and kill some women at some point; apparently revenge for being rejected so much. Looking at the diary we see his occupation was a software designer, a job that Simon Baron-Cohen, Temple Grandin and others have claimed requires autistic traits. The same thing that Bill Gates who has been diagnosed with autism by some members of the ND community has done. Sodini had written:The biggest problem of all is not having relationships or friends, but not being able to achieve and acquire what I desire in those or many other areas,\" said an entry dated Sunday. \"Everthing stays the same regardless of the effert I put in. If I had control over my life then I would be happier. But for about the past 30 years, I have not.\"Sound familiar? Well, this is someone with computer skills and social impairments who was frustrated by celibacy. Perhaps neurodiversity could diagnose him with autism as they have diagnosed Bill Gates. I know, I've been there as have many others including David Miedzianik who has written about it. Of course, most persons who suffer from loneliness regardless of whether or not they are autistic will not go out on a shooting spree, but it is frustrating. This man was clearly deranged. He may or may not have had an autism spectrum disorder, but I feel in order to be fair neurodiversity should take the bad with the good. If they are going to preach about what a gift autism is and say that Bill Gates, Stephen Spielberg, Einstein, Jefferson, etc. prove that autism is such a gift because these individuals have or had it, why not say that Sodini may have been autistic also.Neurodiversity in fact has done the opposite. While I concede that in general persons with autism and/or Asperger's are for the most part law abiding citizens who are more likely to be victims of crimes rather than criminals themselves, there are a small subset of persons with autism spectrum disorders who do commit sometimes violent crimes as part of their disorder. This has been written about in the studies of Murrie and Barry-Walsh who wrote about some case studies of persons with Asperger's who had committed various crimes, such as sexual assault, arson, etc. and talked about the feasibility of an insanity defense of these people based on their diagnosis of Asperger's. Ari Ne'eman has used these studies to try to show that persons with autism do not commit crimes. We can see from his statements that Ne'eman has either never read the studies he quotes from or is deliberately misrepresenting them. I have written about this in a previous post.Neurodiversity claims to be about human rights. Apparently the main right that they fight for and feel people are violating, is their right not to hear autism being described as a bad thing, autistics being described as flawed or bad employees or being any sort of an affliction. They are abusive to me and other autistics who dare to publicly say they hate autism and wish there were a cure. But what about my right, to lead my life the way I want, to think and feel the way I want and my first amendment rights of free speech on the internet or elsewhere? It seems that ND wants to deprive me and others who feel as I do of those rights. Assuming that armchair diagnoses can be made of Bill Gates and others why not of George Sodini? Whose rights will ND violate next? The family members of those killed by Sodini who want to feel that autism is a bad thing because it may have indirectly killed their loved ones?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2009/08/05/2009-08-05_gunman_in_pittsburgh_gym_massacre_george_sodini_planned_shooting_for_months_his.html", "http://georgesodini.com/20090804.htm"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/08/will-neurodiversity-diagnose-george.html", "title": "\nWill neurodiversity diagnose George Sodini with autism?\n"},
{"date": " September 29, 2009", "body": "\nI should be working on my novel instead of this blog post. However, the writing and the research that has been required to write this novel has been very hard for me. It is about an autistic poker player. I would prefer not to go into more detail other than that. I have now written approximately 59,000 words which I am estimating is a little more than half a first draft. It has been very hard to apply myself and carry out this task. There is a good chance I will never get much further than what I have now.Since I was about 13 I dreamed of being a writer. I first attempted to write a novel at age 14. In spite of all my other impairments I was a pretty fast typist, especially for someone aged 14 in those days. I used a typewriter before personal computers and word processors were invented, which may seem like ancient history to some of my younger readers who might not even remember typewriters except as antiques. Because my brain dysfunction not only caused autism type symptoms but also caused perceptual motor and handwriting impairments, I learned how to type at a relatively young age, especially for the 1960s, so I was able to type parts of my first novel which dealt with two mentally retarded individuals, meeting and becoming friends and fighting a system that had wronged them. Writing a novel is quite an undertaking, especially for someone aged 14. It is an even greater undertaking for a 14-year-old who at the time had had practically no mainstream education at all, having been in special ed schools up until that time. I was never able to get very far into the novel and other attempts to write novels were failures. I did still dream of becoming a best selling novelist and using my disability as a selling point or gimmick to achieve that goal. This was again another pipe dream or castle made of sand (from the old Jimi Hendrix song).At about age 38, I had a friend who was a very prolific short story writer and when I told him about my frustrations at never having been able to write a novel he suggested I try short stories first. He was right. Short stories were easier, did not require as much research and seemed to be a potential novelist\u2019s baby steps. I ended up writing 16 short stories some of which I have on my websiteAt about age 45 I decided to make another attempt at writing a novel. I ended up finishing a first draft and then some rewriting, my first novel! The novel dealt with an autistic boy in an abusive special ed school and his parents dealing with the frustrating bureaucracies of the IDEA law and special education. I also met a free lance journalist who did stories for NPR stations. She felt this would be a good story for the show This American Life. Getting on this show would greatly increase my chances of getting the novel published and being able to utilize \"the gimmick\" that I had dreamed about. I was told my novel would probably need work after submitting it to some literary agents and getting rejected. This American Life decided not to include me on their radio show which was devastating. As I worked with various book doctors it became evident my potential bestseller would in fact have to be written over again from scratch!. My friend, Tamar Brott, was able to get another national radio show, studio 360, to do the story of my novel. The show was originally broadcast in late 2002, then about a year and a half ago Tamar's interview with me was recycled on a show which they did about autism You can listen to the show with the recycled interview here. I may be the only person in history who was told my novel was worthless and had to be written over who then a month later was broadcast reading it on an NPR show. I finally shelved the novel as a failed first novel.I wrote some more short stories, some more non-fiction including my article questioning the autism of Bill Gates and others. Now I am working on the second novel. Not sure how well it will ever go or whether I am capable of writing a novel ready for submission for publication. However, I do question some of the \u2018rules\u2019 of the book doctor who pronounced my first novel DOA. Certainly the rule about not using adverbs does not seem applicable or it would mean that Ian Fleming and John Steinbeck were bad fiction writers.Maybe someday I will devote more time to writing the novel than to blogging, but in the meantime I guess if I want to do a slightly easier endeavor I always have autism\u2019s gadfly.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/stories.html", "http://audio.wnyc.org/studio/studio032808a.mp3"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/09/i-should-be-working-on-my-novel-instead.html", "title": "\nI should be working on my novel instead of writing this blog post\n"},
{"date": " July 21, 2009", "body": "\nI am somewhat gratified to see that a best selling author, John Elder Robison, who wrote a memoir about his Asperger's syndrome, Look Me in the Eye, has taken an interest in my blog. He has taken an interest in the fact that I long for a cure for autism (admittedly something not likely to happen in my lifetime). Perhaps having a writer of a best selling memoir taking an interest in your blog means you are making an impact, maybe not.He discusses why I would not regard my autism as any sort of gift and would long for a cure as opposed to his view that though having an ASD has caused him some problems in his life, he does not wish for a cure but to be accepted as he is. He also feels his AS has given him some great gifts. He states that he has been a subject in research studies showing that he has similar neurologic abnormalities to people with much more severe autism, but admits he does not have the problems they have and concedes that is one reason why two people on the spectrum could have such differing viewpoints. In light of these facts, he states that he finds my desire for a cure reasonable, but hopes that I can agree that his desire to live as he is and seek acceptance rather than a cure is reasonable.Yes, I can agree John's take is reasonable for him. I have no desire to force a cure on him if he does not desire one. I see nothing wrong with him seeking acceptance. The problem is this contradicts what he said in his book, where in fact he goes much further than this. On page 5 of his book he states:Asperger's is not a disease there is no cure and there is no need for oneI also wonder since he does not seem to regard his AS as any sort of pathology why would he be a subject in a transmagnetic cranial stimulation experiment. After all, it seems that part of his motivation in being a research subject was there were some facets of his AS that he found disabling and he wanted to participate in the research that Dr. Lindsay Oberman and others are doing along these lines to help correct these deficits.Though I don't have Asperger's per se, I have a high functioning autism condition that is similar to it. Though, unlike person's with Asperger's I had a speech delay, I am physically clumsy and have a poor score on the performance part of the WAIS IQ test and a relatively high verbal score. So basically, he in the book is pushing his view on others that not only does he not need a cure but no one else with Asperger's or a disorder like it does either. So basically John is saying I should not tell him how to live his life, but others who have Asperger's who may be so gravely disabled by the condition (unlike John) that they can't work or find a mate are not diseased and should not be cured if there were an opportunity for a cure.However, John goes on to admit that not all persons with autism spectrum disorders (myself included naturally) will do as well as he does and others. He states that he wishes this issue were not as divisive and polarizing as it is and hopes that people can all get along. I do give him credit and applaud him for saying this. I do agree with this.I do feel that John did a rather superficial perspective on why perhaps I (or someone else whose autism has impacted their lives more than John's has) might have a different view than he does. He is married and has a kid. I have never been married and will likely never be married. He was able to make a good living in various businesses. I have only been able to barely eek out a living sporadically during an approximately 28 year period of my life and had to retire relatively young. John and I are about the same age 51 and 53 respectively. Yet he apparently did not decide that he had Asperger's until he was about 40, where apparently he had a friend who was a psychologist discussed it with him. Though I was not diagnosed with autism until my teens, my mother did ask the person who was my therapist in the 1960s if she thought I was autistic and she said no; so even in those days the possibility was explored. Of course, in 1958, when my parents first noticed something was very wrong with me, I was taken to a pediatric neurologist, who did not know what I had as very few persons had heard of autism in those days. I wonder if John's parents took him to be evaluated for something when he was 3 years old or even 8.I also was a veteran of special education schools for 8 years. I am rather vague on exactly what John's experiences were in special ed. I first got John's attention when I wrote a post stating my distaste for the fact that he and fellow anti-cure autist Stephen Shore were allowed to review research grants for autism funded with public taxpayer money when the official policy of the U.S.A. based on the Combating Autism Act was that research would be funded for the specific intent of curing and preventing autism. I questioned what qualifications he and Steve had for reviewing the research. I received some polite responses from him, both in the comments section of my blog and in one pleasant private email exchange he and I had.He stated that he had also had some experiences in some special ed after school programs in his youth. I will admit that I have not read John's book in its entirety, only parts of it. I sort of feel that I have no use for books where the person who is married and has kids and has a good job and then decides he is autistic well into adulthood. Another example of this is Michael John Carley who not only rejects a cure for himself but states that most autistics don't want a cure in his book Asperger's from the Inside Out. They have not likely shared my life's experiences, so they can't possibly know how rough I have had it due to my disability. So, I don't know what if anything John said in his book about his after school special ed experiences. One reader of gadfly emailed me privately that he had read John's book and he could not recall John ever mentioning anything about his special ed experiences in Look Me in The Eye and felt he would have mentioned this in the book if he in fact had any special ed experiences. I agreed with this. Of course, not having read the entire book, I don't think I can fairly comment on this any further.Also, it is unclear whether or not John was ever officially diagnosed with AS by a clinician before his book was published. My memory of the parts I did read was that he was diagnosed by the psychologist friend of his when he was about 40. However on his website he quotes what some reviewers say about his book. One interesting quote comes up from a library journal review of his book:First-time writer Robison diagnosed himself with Asperger's syndrome after receiving Tony Attwood\u2019s groundbreaking work on the subject from a therapist friend ten years ago.....So it is unclear to this blog writer whether or not Robison has a legitimate diagnosis of AS from a clinician. I certainly have been diagnosed as autistic by at least a few different clinicians. It is the basis for my being on my parent's medical plan as a disabled dependent and the basis for my persual of eligibility for social security disability insurance, which my lawyer is currently handling on a contingency basis.So, in sum my life experiences have been far different, I believe than that of persons like John and Michael Carley. This condition has indeed made my life difficult and this does form my opinion for a need for cure. Again, I will say, I am not trying to impose my view on adults like John who are of the age of consent. I am glad that John has called for civilized discourse in the cure debate. I am also very glad that he has been very polite to me in all of our exchanges over the internet so far and that what I had to write influenced a best selling author enough to make me a subject of one of his blog posts on his psychology today blog. I believe that though John is not a party that it is the neurodiversity, anti-cure people with their sharp rhetoric, constant abuse over the internet of autistics who don't share their viewpoint who have created the polarization of this issue or at least most of it. I hope that at least some of them will read John's post and take what he has to say to heart. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/my-life-aspergers/200907/why-cant-we-all-get-along", "http://www.johnrobison.com/theysay.asp"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/07/john-elder-robison-gives-his-take-on.html", "title": "\njohn elder robison gives his take on gadfly's views\n"},
{"date": " June 10, 2009", "body": "\nIt has been in the news lately that Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin who has a nephew with autism recently participated in a walk for autism speaks. Ms. Palin also has the distinction of being solidly pro-life as far as her political position on abortion goes. She has also given birth to a son with Down's syndrome rather than aborting him when he was still a fetus. According to Ari Ne'eman and other neurodiversity proponents, the peer review literature states that 90% of all pregnancies resulting in a Down's fetus are terminated by abortion. This means that Ms. Palin was in the 10% of mothers who carried her Down's child to term and did not abort him.One neurodiversity blogger, the autism bitch from hell in one of her posts went so far as to say that the only thing on autism speaks' agenda was developing a prenatal test with the intent of being able to abort autistic fetuses. This means that in reality the funding that AS provides to study mu wave rhythm suppression, research on functional magnetic resonance imaging studies and the other things are just a front. They are not really doing this, or somehow funding research on brain waves will ultimately result in finding a way to abort every single autistic fetus that comes along. Even more interesting is the fact that they have given nearly half a million dollars to neurodiversity ideologue Laurent Mottron. This must mean that somehow Mottron's research will lead to a prenatal test to detect autism. When I pointed out the absurdity of the post to her and pointed out that all she had to do was go to autism speaks website and see all of the studies that this organization funds where the connection between them and developing a prenatal test for autism is certainly difficult to understand, ABFH changed the wording of her post from \"the only thing on their agenda\" to \"their ultimate goal\".Considering Palin's pro life stance, the fact that she would be part of the one in ten mothers who carried her Down's baby to term and did not abort him, you would think she would be the darling of the neurodiversity movement. They should be chanting, \"The white house needs a new resident, in 2012 Palin for president\". But somehow ASAN and the other organizations are silent in their endorsement of Palin.I wonder how neurodiversitites explain Palin's involvement with autism speaks. This organization they claim has a goal of finding ways to deliberately abort autistic fetuses. Why then would a woman who solidly opposes abortion and did what ND's should love, i.e., keeping a Down's child baby would support autism speaks, the organization they hate so much? Does anyone else besides me see some irony here? Of course there is probably some explanation which eludes me. So far, when I wondered why Michelle Dawson would continue to work in the Mottron group and why she had not resigned in protest when she so clearly loathes autism speaks I have just heard the unbelievable statement from her that \"science isn't politics\". So I suppose ND's might have an explanation for the anti-abortion, Down's syndrome child mother, Sara Palin's involvement in this organization that they hate so much.I suspect though that this just yet another reason to just say no to neurodiversity\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/walk_events/west_fair_walk_2009_sarah_palin.php", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/neurodiv.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/sara-palin-autism-speaks-and.html", "title": "\nSarah Palin, Autism Speaks and neurodiversity: Some Irony?\n"},
{"date": " March 19, 2009", "body": "\nI see that as part of autism awareness month, the reviled (by the ND movement) autism speaks is pursuing massive fund raising involving several different organizations. For those, such as myself who regularly read the blogs on the autism hub we see that a few bloggers have urged a boycott of Lindt chocolates. The reason for this is that they have teamed up with autism speaks and are donating a portion of their proceeds on each sale of chocolate to AS. It would seem that Lindt is not alone in this endeavor. The following companies have also teamed up with AS in some capacity:Toys\"R\"Us, Inc., TJ Maxx, Modell's Sporting Goods, Build-A-Bear Workshop\u00ae, Discovery HealthI wonder if hub bloggers will start writing posts to boycott all of these pristine companies.  In the United States, Toys 'R' us is one of the biggest retailers of children's toys.  Wonder if their children will cry tears, when they are told, they will have to go without a toy for Christmas, because they are claiming that AS is deliberately trying to abort autistic fetuses and all the other nonsense they espouse. One wonders at what point, the ND's will have to wear barrels because every clothing manufacturer is teaming up with autism speaks.  What will happen when various grocery stores and restaurant chains start teaming up with autism speaks.  Will they go on a hunger strike, will they die of starvation?  I can't wait to see what happens. I don't know whether or not the true prevalence of autism is rising.  It is possible that the increase may be partially real because more men are becoming first time fathers at later ages.  There has been research showing an association between paternal age and the likelihood to father an autistic child.  There is also a temporal relationship between autism and the passage of special education legislation at least in the u.s.a. and possibly other countries as well.  Whatever the reasons more and more persons are being diagnosed with autism than ever before.  I don't know if the prevalence will rise to greater than 1/150 persons or not.The point is that the more persons diagnosed with autism, the more interest there will be in funding science that may lead to preventing autism in children and possibly finding a cure.  For that reason, more and more businesses will be teaming up with autism speaks and donating money to them, much to the chagrin of the neurodiverse.  Neurodiversity may claim they comprise a good portion of the autistic community or even the autism community.  In reality they are a fringe group whose view is out of the mainstream.  Most persons who are touched by autism support autism speaks' agenda of trying to find a cure and prevent this tragedy from happening to other children.  So, as more and more enterprises start teaming up with autism speaks, one wonders whether the crusade against Lindt chocolates will be expanded to these other enterprises.  How many consumer goods will the ND's deprive themselves of?  Only time will tell. However, one member of the ND movement, Michelle Dawson, apparently does not want to boycott autism speaks, at least not when money to fund research she is involved with is concerned.  Her mentor Laurent Mottron mentors post-doctoral fellow luc Keita who works on a grant from AS.  Also Michelle has coauthored at least one paper with Jocelyn Faubert, a scientist funded by AS.  .  I am baffled as to why Michelle would not consider this money tainted, why she would not resign from the Mottron lab in protest.  Yet, her fellow ND's still cherish, her and her writings.  Michelle is not considered a quisling (a term more than one ND proponent has called me) or a sellout.So I guess for all those reasons I will have to wait and see what and who the ND movement boycotts next.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2009/03/prweb2247744.htm"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/03/more-businesses-and-organizations-for.html", "title": "\nmore businesses and organizations for neurodiversity to boycott\n"},
{"date": " June 18, 2009", "body": "\nYet, still on the same subject that was started by the recently published study of Isabel Souleries, I have yet some new thoughts that have been on my mind. When I questioned the statement of Michelle Dawson that she hoped that the effect of her 2007 paper on Raven's vs. Wechsler would have the practical effect of autistic persons not being written off I was challenged by one of the most prolific commenters on this blog, Lorene Amet (AKA SM69). She asked me how I could say that since if the intelligence and capabilities of persons with autism were questioned this would influence the prognosis and the likelihood of success. This is sort of similar to the thesis of the Mottron group which states that their research will help prove how capable many autistics are by showing where their abilities lie. Lorene also questioned my statement that an autistic brain is diseased and/or defective. She seemed to think that nothing was wrong with the brains of persons with autism but only some peripheral physiology that affected their brains. I responded to her comment, but in retrospect I feel I could have given her a better response and my response was far from complete, so I would like to write about this now.The issues involved in Souleries, Dawson's, Boelte's etc. studies are whether or not intelligence in autistics has been underestimated. This might be due to the fact that the Wechsler is not a valid IQ test for testing autistics due to their unique way of being. The Raven's or some other instrument might be more valid. If so, then we can do a better job of teaching autistics and their overall prognosis might not be as poor.Part of the problem with the Souleries study was that the autistic participants, as measured by the Wechsler are reasonably intelligent on average to begin with.The average full scale IQ was 100.87 with a range of 85-121. The average verbal IQ was 99.20 with a range of 81-121 the average performance IQ was 102.8 with a range of 95-120. Therefore the majority of these subjects were likely of average or better intelligence to begin with.But let's dispense with all of this and get to the real nitty gritty. What if the Mottron group is correct in their assertions that intelligence in autistics has been underestimated. What if many if not most autistic people are truly intelligent? Aside from the obvious fact that it is quite possible the autistic with an IQ of greater than 100 will have a more favorable prognosis than one with an IQ of less than 70, lets just confine the question to higher functioning autistics, lets say those with a verbal IQ of 100 or higher. Or even some persons with autism who seem very intelligent to me based on my subjective perception of interacting with them on the internet without knowing how well they might do on a standardized test.At the risk of immodesty, I count myself in this category. I believe that I am an intelligent person. I am able to express my thoughts well and write a reasonably good blog post. At the age of 11 my reading ability was tested at a tenth grade level. This is in spite the of the fact that at this time I had never received a mainstream education of any kind. I also managed to graduate from college, something some neurotypicals have not been able to do. Yet, I had to give up working, I have had problems with funny movements, motor impairments, inability to completely care for myself and immense problems with social relationships and phobias. My voice is uncontrollably loud. Autism has made my life hard and has incapacitated me, except for being able to write some of these blog posts. This blog has actually given my mundane life some meaning.Moving onto other people, I see glimmers of intelligence of a number of my blog readers with autism. First there is Jake Crosby who spent a fair amount of time in self-contained special education classes. He probably was not able to receive the same educational opportunities as some other children who were not on the autism spectrum. At age 20 he currently attends Brandeis, a major university. He writes very articulate and thoughtful posts on the Age of Autism blog. This is to the chagrin of neurodiversity proponents who complain about autism speaks and other organizations they don't like not putting autistics in positions of power or allowing their voices to be heard. Yet when age of autism put this autistic individual on their editorial board at an extremely young age, they immediately cried \"token autistic\". Also condescending statements and attitudes towards Jake due to his age were at times expressed. Jake seems well read to me on a variety of autism issues and has shown intelligence to me. Roger Kulp, another one of my readers with autism, also seems to show a high level of intelligence based on some of the comments he has written on my blog and others. There is no question that this individual's intelligence is more than intact. Stephanie Lynn Keil is yet another example of this. In addition to this 21-year-old young woman being an extremely talented artist, she also has an IQ which may be in the genius or near genius level. In spite of spending much time in institutions during her childhood, she has managed to become educated enough to read psychiatric textbooks and understand them with great precision.I offer apologies in advance to any of the above-mentioned individuals if I made any factual errors about them or they were not happy about me mentioning them in a blog post.What do these three (four including me) intelligent individuals with autism have in common. We all hate our autism. We don't subscribe to the neurodiversity philosophy and wish we could be cured. Why must that be if we are so intelligent?In Jake's case, he got a poor grade on one of his history papers because he was too disorganized and lacked the executive function to cite references properly. His autism has made it difficult for him to plan and do things that he wants.Roger Kulp's behavior has regressed at various times in his life. He has not worked and has had to be on SSI. He has had problems with elopement and other problems with autism that have made his life difficult in spite of having an intact intelligence.Stephanie is also on SSI and has had problems with self-injury and other issues. She lived in institutions for a number of years but fortunately was able to live with her father at his house where I think she still lives.How can these persons have all these problems when they are intelligent, yet, according to Mottron and to others intelligence in autistics means a good prognosis and means we should not regard them as write-offs? Perhaps the answer is that intelligence does not necessarily mitigate the problems of autism in most persons with this affliction. A score on the Wechsler, the Ravens or any other standardized test, the ability to solve problems rapidly in an fMRI scanner probably does not correlate with the ability to pay the rent, have social relationships or control difficult behavior.Perhaps it is time to rethink our view of recognition of intelligence being a salvation for those on the spectrum who are high functioning (at least intelligence-wise).I hope none of the above individuals takes offense at my writing about them.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/is-intelligence-indicator-of-prognosis.html", "title": "\nIs intelligence an indicator of prognosis in high functioning autism?\n"},
{"date": " April 3, 2009", "body": "\nI just thought that I would have to comment on the new study that implicates the area of the brain known as the locus coeruleus with autism. The locus coeruleus is the source in the brain of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. The hypothesis originates from the fact that there is anecdotal evidence that when autistic children get fevers this mitigates their symptoms. The locus coeruleus is involved in fever. The authors go on to speculate that autism could just be due to dysregulation of the locus coeruleus and because of this it could make it easier to mitigate the symptoms of autism or possibly even find a way to reverse it. I have only read the article in science daily that I have linked to and the abstract of the study, so I can't comment on all of the specifics of the study. From what I have read though it sounds more like a hypothesis than the authors having any empirical evidence that the LC plays any role in autism. So, I won't hold my breath as far as any major breakthroughs in the treatment of autism as a result of this research. However, when reading things like this, it helps to give hope that someday, something can be done to mitigate or cure this horrible tragedy that afflicts so many persons. The authors go on to emphasize in the article that this does not mean something can be done for autism as a result of their research in one fell swoop (their words).If the prevalence of autism is really 1 in 150, then if this becomes more than a hypothesis and further research validates this as something that could help autism, then this would provide an incentive for drug companies to come up with some norepinephrine agonist (a drug that will create more norepinephrine in the brain presuming autism is caused by a dysregulation of this neurotransmitter) and much money would be made and autism at the very least would be as treatable as schizophrenia is currently with anti-psychotic medications even if the medications don't cure autism. This might make ABA as a therapy for autism just as obsolete as hydrotherapy is now for schizophrenia. Hydrotherapy was the treatment of choice for schizophrenia in the 1940s before anti-psychotic medications were developed and used for schizophrenics. Like ABA, its proponents touted hydrotherapy as the only scientifically proven treatment to ameliorate schizophrenia. I realize that these are just dreams now and it is unlikely such a medication or treatment for autism will be invented based on this research in the foreseeable future.I have emailed the lead author of the study Dr. Mehler and have asked him for a .pdf copy of the actual study itself so I will have more to read than just the science daily article and the abstract. If I get the actual paper I may edit this post or post a follow-up post.What is most interesting of all to me is that about 20 years ago, when I had my first MRI scan by Eric Courchesne's research group, I had a similar speculation that the etiology of autism might be caused by a dysfunction in the locus coeruleus and that norepinephrine might be involved in the etiology of autism. The dorsal tegmental bundle is a tract that comes from the locus coeruleus and is one of the two main tracts of neurons that spreads the neurotransmitter norepinephrine to the various areas of the brain that use this substance to generate chemical messages that control various functions of the brain. The axons of these fibers project to the neocortex, hippocampus and cerebellar cortex and medulla. The cerebellum has been implicated in autism and various studies have shown a loss of purkinje cells in the cerebellum of autistics as opposed to normal controls. Norepinephrine is one of the two neurotransmitters that are used by purkinje cells The other one is GABA (gamma amino butyric acid). Norepinephrine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. This might be the reason for the inability to control certain movements in autism and \"stimming\", lack of an inhibitory neurotransmitter. More evidence of the norepinephrine/stimming theory comes from the fact that some of the axons of the dorsal tegmental bundle terminate on the superior cerebellar peduncle, which is one of the three structures that attach the cerebellum to the rest of the brain. It has been found that stimulation of the superior cerebellar peduncles is reinforcing. Subsequent studies have found ablation of the locus coereulus did not abolish this reinforcing effect. I think it is possible that norepinephrine in the typical brain acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter and suppresses certain things in the superior cerebellar peduncle. If this system was dysregulated it could cause lack of inhibition causing autistics to self-stimulate in order to get this reinforcement.As I mentioned before, these fibers also travel through the hippocampus. This brain structure is responsible for short term memory. Persons who have had severe epileptic seizures have sometimes had this brain structure removed. These persons can no longer form short term memories and they constantly live in the past. I wrote a short story  that was inspired by this phenomena. Various studies have found abnormalities in the limbic systems of  persons with autism.  The hippocampus is part of the limbic system.  Also persons with autism often have extremely good memories.  Some of them are even savants with photographic memories.  It is possible that the lack of an inhibitory neurotransmitter such as norepinephrine could produce this effect, opening up structures that would be normally inhibited in a typical brain. I discussed this theory with Eric Courchesne at the time I was his research subject and he said it was an interesting theory that could possibly be valid, but only science would be able to tell.   I wondered if it would be possible to do an MRI scan of the cerebellar peduncles the way he had scanned the cerebellum and had found abnormalities in the cerebellar vermi of persons with autism.  He stated that such a study could not be done because the cerebellar peduncles were only a few millimeters and too small to be measured with MRI scanning and compared to typical controls.  Of course this was many years ago and things may have changed so it might be possible to do a structural MRI of this area of the brain now.  Of course, most studies nowadays seem to be doing functional MRI rather than structural. I wrote to Margaret Bauman, another autism researcher, and asked her if there was evidence of abnormalities in norepinephrine in autistic brains.  She stated that her research had not found any but it was possibly due to the measurement techniques they used. Dr. Bauman is one of the few persons to have done post mortem autopsies of the brains of persons with autism.  It would be good if post mortem autopsies could be done but the problem is autistics usually live out their natural lives and it has been only recently that persons have been diagnosed as autistic.  This does not mean that autistics over the age of 75 do not exist as the mercury militia and others insist, but only that they were never diagnosed.  If such persons near the end of their life could be found and will their brains to science, then perhaps we could find some real answers to autism and possibly even a cure someday.  Of course I realize this is not realistic anytime in the foreseeable future.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090401145312.htm", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/stories/luv.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/04/locus-coeruleus-and-autism.html", "title": "\nThe Locus Coeruleus and autism\n"},
{"date": " January 30, 2009", "body": "\nI wonder if most persons who have an autistic child or in fact a number of persons with autism themselves who might, for various reasons, not be inclined or be able to write about autism on the internet would regard autism as not being harmful. I also wonder whether autism researchers, such as my friend Matthew Belmonte, who has a brother who has never spoken would regard autism as harmless. Apparently, Laurent Mottron, Morton Gernsbacher and Michelle Dawson (her again)question the premise that autism is harmful. In the article I just linked to, they question this premise based on a variety of cognitive tests that research subjects in their lab and other labs have received. They seem to think that because the persons with autism whom they and various other researchers have tested have a superior score on the block design and other types of tests somehow shows that autism is not a harmful disability.One of the reasons I have linked to this article is because I was having a dialogue with one of my favorite individuals in the ND movement, someone who calls herself \"alyric\". As part of the dialogue I had noted that Michelle Dawson and her colleagues had pointed out in a journal article they did not believe autism was harmful. Alyric expressed disbelief and challenged me to produce documentation of the article, which I promptly did. Alyric claims that she is a big fan of Michelle's, so I am absolutely shocked that Alyric would be so ignorant of the published work that her idol and those she collaborates with have produced. I am equally shocked that Michelle Dawson would claim to have such great respect for this person who is unaware of her publications, but I suppose that is neither here nor there.The article goes on to imply that Nicholas Tessla, who was celibate, had autism. It gives a quote from Tessla questioning how many inventions came from married men. Interestingly enough,Thomas Edison one of the most prolific inventors of all time was married. So perhaps Mottron, et. al. should not be implying that Tessla was autistic or even that his autistic celibacy was a gift resulting in the ability to invent.It then ends with an autistic woman stealing Larry Arnold's well-known metaphor about the one-eyed man being king in the country of the blind. The authors imply that autism would not be harmful if society changed.I must respectfully disagree. I believe my autism that has impaired my ability to make a living, caused fine motor and perceptual problems (incidentally, I am one of those rare autistics who does poorly on the block design test), inability to have friendships and romantic relationships, causes me to self-stimulate throughout the day and not get things done (except some posts on this blog with a bit of effort), my phobias are harmful. Harold Doherty I am sure, regards the problems of his son Connor harmful. Josh Greenfield has written about his severely autistic son in a few books and how harmful he thought the boy's constant screaming, tantrums, inability to talk or take care of himself was. I wonder if the mother of Ashley Brock (the little girl whose autism caused her to drown because she was too impaired to be aware of the danger water posed for her) would regard autism as harmless. I really don't think so. I must respectfully disagree with Dr. Mottron and his two co-authors. It would be nice if society could be more accepting, I agree, but that is only a small part of the problem. Contrary to what those in the ND movement believe about me, I am not opposed to human rights for persons with disabilities. However, societal acceptance and the lack of rights (alleged or otherwise) do not constitute a lot of the problems that persons with autism have.I wonder if those persons at autism speaks who review grant proposals for research have read Dr. Mottron's piece. Since they provide funding to his laboratory, I can either conclude that they have not read the above article that I have linked to or they are asleep at the switch, indeed incompetent in regards to whom they decide to fund. I suspect there are many parents who try to raise money for autism speaks, through walks, solicitations of donations from their friends, etc. who would disagree with Dr. Mottron's view that autism is not harmful. I wonder how they would feel about this man receiving funding with their money. In their case, I suspect many of these parents have never read Dr. Mottron's treatise and never will. I wonder how the powers that be at autism speaks can explain themselves to these good people who have so much frustration over their child's disability. These people I suspect long for a cure, or at least a way that the behaviors and problems that their children have can be mitigated in order to not be harmful. I wonder what these people would think of Dr. Mottron's essay.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Gernsbacher_BBS_Commentary.pdf", "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edbio.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/01/autism-isnt-harmful.html", "title": "\nautism isn't harmful?\n"},
{"date": " January 23, 2009", "body": "\nI see that one of my favorite hatemongers and propagandists in the neurodiversity movement, someone who calls themselves the autism bitch from hell is at it again Her latest post is another propaganda effort with the tired cliche constantly purported by neurodiversity. She writes: Autism Speaks has never come close to being an anti-vaccine group. Its agenda consists of one thing only: Genetic research to develop a prenatal test to be used for routine abortion of autistic children.What is so absurd about this statement is that they fund the work of my friend Matthew Belmonte who does fMRI research as well as event related potential research. They also fund the work of a Dr. Pineda who does work in neurofeedback mirror neuron studies and mu wave suppression, no relation to genetics at all.In addition to this, they lobby for insurance bills in order to get insurance companies to pay for treatments such as ABA and speech therapy, again nothing to do with genetics.This new attempt at propaganda by this person who is too cowardly to sign their own name to their posts is truly pathetic. One can't help wondering if the reason ABFH posts anonymously is that she is perhaps afraid of a libel suit from AS, as they certainly would be on solid legal ground if they chose to pursue legal action against the ABFH for her nasty and defamatory statements.One only has to look at the grants section of the AS website to see how full of shit this person is. We see that AS funds the work of a UCLA scientist named Deanna Greene who studies socially driven attention in autistic children using fMRI imaging. We see they fund a kathleen meyer who studies sibling imitation intervention treatments. And the list goes on and on. We can see that there are many things that AS funds that have nothing to do with genetics, let alone the stupidity and the nastiness of claiming they are deliberately trying to find a way to abort autistic fetuses.Last but certainly not least they fund one of the idols of neurodiversity, Dr. Lauren Mottron who employs postdoctoral fellow Luc Keita who receives funding from AS. This lab also employs neurodiversity sidekick michelle dawson. ABFH recently wrote a post about Michael John Carley being a traitor, but she does not seem to feel the same way about michelle dawson who continues to work in the Mottron lab which solicits AS funding and won't resign in protest.However, there is one thing that ABFH does get right in her diatribe. The fact that autism speaks is now trying to cowtow to the mercury militia to get in their good graces. Actually, I feel that autism speaks should change their name to money talks based on their behavior. They have Sally Bernard on their board of directors who from what I have heard has a worth somewhere in the neighborhood of 350 million dollars. She is one of the founders of the mercury causes autism group SAFEMINDS and was one of the authors of the first journal article to claim that autism was a form of mercury poisoning. The anti-vax camp has tons of money and power behind it. Autism speaks certainly covets that additional capital. Also it is possible that Bob and Suzanne Wright are trying to overcome the rift with their daughter Katie, a militant anti-vax activist who constantly writes articles on the age of autism webpage, which endorses an \"autism epidemic caused by vaccine point of view\".ABFH goes on to say they have no hope of AS redeeming themselves in the eyes of the ND movement. This is probably true also, as ND is a weak and puny little movement, that looks much bigger than it really is because of the internet. They don't have the capital of the mercury militia. This is probably why they complain about no autistics on the board. They just want to get into that capital and want to try to change AS into an ND type organization. As they don't have the capital of Sallie Bernard and JB Handley they will have no hope of doing that.It is a shame that ABFH has to stoop to such ridiculous propaganda and anyone willing to check the facts will see how absurd her claims are.Addendum: I see that ABFH has changed the wording in her post from it's agenda consists of only one thing to its ultimate goal. This was her response to my comment on her blog and this post, since obviously they don't do one thing at AS. By using ultimate goal she can just claim they are more interested in that than in anything else, but it is still baloney as one can see from looking at the AS site and what it funds, certainly its ultimate goal is to find a cure for autism and to help kids in the now with academic and other issues.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2009/01/alison-tepper-singer-grows-up.html", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/science/research/grants/research_we_have_funded_fellowship_2008.php"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/01/autism-bitch-from-hell-neurodiversity.html", "title": "\nAutism Bitch from Hell: Neurodiversity Propagandist\n"},
{"date": " January 6, 2009", "body": "\nDavid Kirby, who became renowned for his book, Evidence of Harm, which tried to suggest that thimerosal, a preservative in vaccines was responsible for causing autism and a huge increase in autism prevalence in the 1990s is at it again. He has written an article on the Huffington Post stating that the IACC which came about when congress passed the combating autism act has made recommendations that millions of dollars be funded to see if a link between vaccines and autism can be found. This includes a controlled study of some sort comparing autism rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated children. Though I suppose there are some children who don't get vaccinated at all nowadays, they might be few and far between due to most states having laws requiring children receive a variety of vaccinations for school attendance.One thing that I am rather surprised at is the lack of commentary by members of the autism hub and others in the neurodiversity movement, since they seem to not only object to the lack of scientific evidence showing that vaccines cause autism but apparently are offended that anyone would imply that autistic people are somehow \"toxic\" in some way, but leave such bizarre reasoning to the neurodiverse. Since they don't seem to want to write about the problems with this, I suppose the onus falls on me, another disbeliever of the vaccines cause autism hypothesis.As regular readers of autism's gadfly know, I have written about what a joke the combating autism act and the IACC are. Though the combating autism act was written and designed to cure and prevent autism, the law stated that one of the members of the IACC must be autistic themselves. The person who was given this honor was published autistic author, prolific conference presenter and fast rising autistic superstar Stephen Shore--The Barack Obama of autism that everyone seems to like. However, Steve is opposed to a cure for autism yet is allowed to serve on the IACC. In addition, vaccine causes autism boosters Mark Blaxill and Lynn Redwood also serve on the IACC. This is likely the reason that vaccine research has been given top priority in spite of all of the evidence against it, with study after study refuting the connection and all of the believers, including Blaxill and Redwood claiming there is a government coverup or some other kind of conspiracy to withhold the truth from the people.Blaxill in one of his emails to me claimed that SAFEMINDS and other organizations had nowhere near the resources of the government to prove vaccines cause autism, so they could not fund studies to refute all the government studies. This is in spite of the fact that his fellow SAFEMINDS board member Sallie Bernard may have a net worth in the neighborhood of like 300 million dollars.I have also written about how hypocritical I believe ASAN and other neurodiversity sympathizers are to have attempted to hijack this law that they have made plain that they are opposed to for their own self-serving agendas.I was wondering if any of these fat cats, educated journalists, and others who are boosting the vaccine hypothesis would be willing to read my article showing the lack of correlation between thimerosal and autism prevalence increases between 1970 and 1990. I believe this article also refutes vaccines in general rather than thimerosal in particular hypothesis. Until anyone at all can refute what I wrote in my article and show where my reasoning is wrong, I will stand by my assertion that I have shown there is no way in the world that vaccines can account for huge rises in autism that took place in this time frame.If this vaccine stuff is funded this means millions of dollars that could go to more constructive research, such as funding my friend Matthew Belmonte, funding more postmortem autopsies of autistic brains, more MRI scans and more genetic studies to pin down the genetic etiology of autism. Also some environmental studies of something other than vaccines could be funded. This would mean a greater probability of autism being cured or preventable sooner rather than later. If more money is spent on vaccine research on top of all the money that has been flushed down the toilet already, it means our knowledge of the etiology of autism and ways that it could be cured or prevented will remain in the stone age.It would seem that the federal government, the combating autism act and the IACC have made a mockery of the noble goal of preventing and curing autism once again. Perhaps before the government flushes more money down the toilet they could consult with your humble blogger or show where his reasoning is wrong first.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/top-federal-autism-panel_b_155293.html", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/thimerosal.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/01/vaccine-debate-not-over-says-david.html", "title": "\nvaccine debate not over says David Kirby\n"},
{"date": " August 13, 2008", "body": "\nFor the very few people who have read my writings, they know that in the past I have written about the psychological defense mechanisms, first postulated by Sigmund Freud of denial and reaction formation. I have stated that I believe these defense mechanisms are responsible for the genesis of the neurodiversity movement. Here is a brief recap of those defense mechanisms: Denial is just that, denial. You are trying to convince yourself that the stark reality that is staring you in the face just is not true. This is what compels some (though not necessarily all) neurodiversity adherents to claim autism is not a defect but an alternative form of brain wiring.  This is why some of them imply that being autistic is no different than being gay versus being straight, no different than being left-handed versus right-handed etc.   The neurodiverse just can't deal with the fact that they or their offspring are defective or broken so they just deny it. Reaction formation is a bit more complicated. It stems from not being able to deal with feelings of something you hate. So you turn that something you hate into something you love. You can't deal with autism, you hate it. For those who watched the Good Morning America segment on neurodiversity, Diane Sawyer said it well,  neurodiversity is just a beautiful way of justifying heartbreak.  Therefore you try to turn it into something beautiful like Klare Estee Wolfhond (not sure i got her name right) saying that there is joy in autism and having a blog entitled joy of autism. This is why some persons claim that autism is a gift and should not be eradicated. This is why people claim that Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, etc. are/were autistic. For more details on why this reasoning is wrong, I again refer the reader to my essay on the subject, www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/undiagnosing.html on this subject.Another Freudian defense mechanism that I believe neurodiversity people sometimes use that I did not mention before is displacement. For example, what if you have a job and the boss is being mean to you? You want to tell your boss to fuck off or at the very least sing him your favorite song, Take this job and shove it, for those who remember the old johnny paycheck song.  But you're not wealthy, you can't afford to quit your job or be fired, even if the boss is a horse's ass.  However, you feel you are going to get a coronary or an ulcer if you have to hold your anger in.  You might have children.  You can yell at them, even spank them.  They are powerless to do anything about it.  You might start yelling at your kids because there are no consequences for yelling at them.  You are a big guy.  You can't punch out your boss without losing your job.  You might get drunk and get into a barroom brawl with someone smaller than you instead.  You are displacing your anger onto someone else.Many persons in the neurodiversity movement seem to be quite angry.  They are abusive to parents of autistic children who express a desire to cure them.  They sometimes call people names like nazi.  They are angry about their autism.  They have to displace it somewhere.  The organization Autism Speaks is a favorite whipping boy.  They accuse this organization of genocide.  They are constantly nasty to autism speaks and those who are involved in it.  They get angry at someone wishing for a cure for autism saying this is the way they are, that a cure would destroy them, when there is not an iota of scientific evidence to support that contention. Displacement, another neurodiversity defense mechanism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/undiagnosing.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/08/displacement-yet-another-neurodiversity.html", "title": "\nDisplacement: Yet another neurodiversity defense mechanism\n"},

She writes about how the Judge Rottenberg Center run by the notorious Matthew \"Dr. Hurt\" Israel is meeting with some persons in Israel and is trying to set up shop in that country because of threats of the state of Massachusetts and other places banning the use of the electric shocks and other aversives Dr. Israel uses to treat children.  The ABFH also stated that ASAN president Ari' Neeman was in Israel, trying to talk to the powers that be hoping that they would not allow the doctor whose name is coincidentally the same as the country's to hang out his shingle there.  The Judge Rottenberg Center was formally called the behavior research institute.  This is a rather ironic misnomer as Dr. Israel apparently has never submitted any of his work to peer review as far as I can tell.  In one of the issues of JADD they state that Dr. Israel was expelled from the autism society of america for practicing clinical psychology without a license.The Behavior research institute used to operate in northern Los Angeles near where i live.  However, they left California after the Hughes act was passed by the California state legislature in 1991 outlawing aversives in the state of California.  They left and went back east where for some mysterious reason, the use of aversives including extremely painful electric shocks on autistic children is still legal. What ABA enthusiasts won't tell desperate autistic parents looking for help for their kids is that the study by lovaas showing ABA as an effective treatment was entirely contingent upon aversives.  This was the key ingredient that made the difference in the alleged \"normal\" functioning that was produced in half of the children.  So ABA without aversives is being marketed dishonestly.  Unfortunately, this won't be part of the debate on JRC.  I think Lovaas also stopped using aversives in his research altogether after the Hughes act was passed.  If it were not passed, perhaps aversives would still be a component of ABA research in California. In the past ASAN has been involved, in my opinion, in some silly activities.  Like getting the ransom notes thing pulled, which did nothing to help autistic people.  I mean who cares if someone is saying as advertising we are taking your kid hostage and what a waste of time to put an effort into stopping this activity. Also ASAN is protesting the slur \"retard\"  used in the movie tropic thunder in a nonmalicious manner.  They also collaborated with neurodiversity proponent Kent Adams (AKA ChristSchool) to make a video protesting the use of the word in a nonmalicious manner.  This is in spite of the fact that Mr. Adams also produced a video Marty Murphy: House Autistic to criticize autistics who long for a cure.  This video was a bunch of malicious hate mongering crap and reduced ASAN's credibility.  Tropic Thunder is a huge box office success, so perhaps their relationship with Mr. Adams backfired on them.  I hope so.  Well the boycotts of the movie were ineffective in any event.I looked at ASAN's web page and did not find anything about Ari's trip to Israel or his efforts to stop expansion of the JRC.  I hope that ABFH is correct about this.  If true I am glad that ASAN is finally doing something useful for a change.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2008/08/judge-rotenberg-center-abroad.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/08/amazing-asan-may-actually-be-doing.html", "title": "\namazing, ASAN may actually be doing something useful\n"},
{"date": " August 2, 2008", "body": "\nWell here is an interesting new literary journal I happened across http://www.hyperlexiajournal.com/ This is a new literary journal that will start publication in October that is set up specifically to Celebrate autism. So we have that woman (I don't remember her exact name) who has the joy of autism blog. Also Liane Willey a female with alleged asperger's who was able to get a ph.d., marry and have children also feels that brain damage should be celebrated. Maybe John Best will blog about this with one of his usual rants. This will probably make him angry. Though there are a lot of things I don't agree on with Best, and don't agree with all of his tactics. One thing I do agree with him on is that it is time to stop celebrating brain damage. Yes, you read right, I believe that autism is brain damage. Some neurodiversity adherents seem to be offended by the term brain damage, even though they somehow acknowledge that autism is a disability and more than merely a \"difference\".Interestingly enough the hyperlexia journal says that the good and the bad should be celebrated. Why should bad things be celebrated. They also go on to state that the diversity of the human mind should be respected and any hateful submissions will be rejected.  This likely includes anyone that wishes to cure autism or believes that autism is any sort of deficiency. The maximum word count of submissions is small, 1500 words or less.  This does not give much leeway for most short stories, though I suppose a lot of poems fit this criteria.  Also some short essays.   I have written 23 short stories.  Not a single one of them has been published.  A few of my nonfiction essays have been published in a few places though but not very many.  I am always hoping to find places where, as a fledgling writer, I can submit pieces to.

{"date": " August 19, 2008", "body": "\nWell I see that yet another autism hub blogger, neurodiversity proponent has once again gone over the top. In a blog post entitled Don't Blame Autrism(sic) here, http://chaoticidealism.livejournal.com/48892.html she seems to imply that my problems with having been fired from multiple jobs and being forced to retire at a relatively young age, never having a girlfriend when I am over 50, fine motor coordination and perceptual motor problems that greatly impair my handwriting and ability to do other perceptual motor and fine motor tasks (excluding typing though) and my irrational phobia of birds, my uncontrollable self-stimulatory movements which have precluded me from having very many friends and have even gotten me into trouble with my neighbors as well as certain law enforcement agencies are not the result of having an autistic spectrum disorder. There is some other explanation for them and I am just using my autism as an excuse. We need to look at the problem she says and try to find solutions for them and stop blaming autism. Autism is just an excuse apparently. This apparently also goes for parents of autistic kids. I presume this includes very severely autistic children who cannot speak, bang their heads into walls and elope and sometimes get run over by cars and drown. Autism is not responsible for this, it is something else and all we have to do is look at the problem and come up with some sort of solution. She takes a shot at biomed claiming this causes an addiction to biomed for parents who I guess follow DAN protocols. Though I doubt these treatments are helpful myself, I can understand why a parent would want to do them for their child, she seems to think there is something wrong with this and this does not need to be done. There is another solution someplace.This thinking is not unique to her, it seems pretty pervasive throughout the adherents of the neurodiversity movement. Michelle Dawson seems to imply that the only reason autistics have bad outcomes is societal. If autistics were not discriminated against they would do as well as others. We also have Larry Arnold who makes analogies with a work of fiction, The Country of the Blind showing that autistics could function well if given the necessary accommodations. We have Ari Neeman and the rest of ASAN who claim they are opposed to a cure, a cure is not necessary because being anti-cure is not anti-progress. Their solution to the problem is to take umbrage at every perceived slight that happens to autistic people. Therefore the campaign against NYU's ransom notes ads and criticizing the film tropic thunder for using the word 'retard' in a non-malicious manner are somehow progress.I posted a comment to her asking her to please be more specific. Just how can these problems be solved. Similarly to the rest of her neurodiversity colleagues she neglected to give specific answers. However, there is some very good news for persons affected by autism who feel they suffer tremendously from their or their loved one's autism. All one has to do is go to the neurodiversity forums Aspies For Freedom and Wrongplanet.net and post exactly what the specific problem is. One of the other posters there will have a solution. I can't get over what wonderful news this is for parents, who have to pay many thousands of dollars for ABA treatments, DAN protocols, special Ed attornies to pursue claims under the IDEA that they feel will help their child with autism etc. All of this great expense and effort is absolutely unnecessary. Someone in one of these two forums will have the solution as to what to do. They will post it on the internet for you free of charge. No need for any of these expensive treatments. Autism speaks can now disband, they don't need to do walks to promote fundraising. This is just wonderful news :).It is such a shame that there was no internet, no aspies for freedom and no wrongplanet.net in the 1960s to guide my parents when they were looking so hard for a cure for me that was unnecessary. They would not have needed to pay for private special education schools, occupational therapists and expensive psychoanalysis. All they would have had to do was post on one of these two forums and one of the geniuses there would have come up for a solution to my problems for which autism was obviously not responsible for.This sort of thinking is why I have in my motto \"We Don't need no stinkin' neurodiversity\". This kind of dangerous thinking is why I urge people to just say no to neurodiversity here http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/neurodiv.html.I still remember the outrage at Michael Savage's comments about autism not being real and 90% of autistic kids being just brats and people using their autism as an excuse to collect government benefits.Is Chaotic Idealism's post so much different from Mr. Savage's? I don't think so.

Zach, put the following info on his web page: Zazzle: Well we have recieved letters in the past from um ah Autism Speaks in regards to prodcuts withtrademark violations so when our um content management staff came across this product they believed this shirt was in the um past correspondence with Autism Speaks but uh they did not specifically call on this product, this was a decision by an employee from content managment.[...]So apparently neurodiversity's latest cause celebre' turns out to be completely bogus.  Zach did offer an apology to autism speaks for trying to turn this into a figurative federal case with no evidence whatsoever that autism speaks had anything to do with this.  I am glad Zach acknowledged his error and I applaud him for that.  However, will Amanda Baggs apologize for using this as an excuse to villify the organization she detests so much?  Will autism bitch from hell print a retraction on her web page?  Last but not least, will Alex Plank put an update on wrongplanet.net Alex seems to have a tendency to come to erroneous assumptions without doing any fact checking, like his assumption that most autistics are like him and don't want to be cured.  I asked him publically how he came to that assumption but he still refuses to answer.  I hope that this will teach Alex not to do such a slip shod job of fact checking as his web page gets a considerable amount of traffic.  At some point such a shoddy job of managing a web page with thousands of subscribers may put him into legal jeopardy if he continues to engage in such irresponsible behavior.  I wonder if my new found friend, Emily, will write the retraction on her blog as she promised me, I hope so.  We will see if this is a lesson learned for those in the neurodiversity movement who have such an axe to grind?  Some will say that because the content manager of Zazzle sent Zach the letter he had every right to assume that the decision did come from autism speaks.  Well it seems in this instance common sense was thrown out the window.  It seems that many neurodiversity proponents are so bigoted they would not stop to think that assuming Zach's t-shirt did not violate any copyrights that maybe a huge multimillion dollar corporation would not deliberately threaten a bogus lawsuit against a small t-shirt salesperson.  This should seem obvious.  Of course I must take some cupability myself because I did not think of this until the following day, so I suppose I might have to put on my dunce cap and sit in the corner for half an hour too.

Somehow, I don't think these neurodiversity proponents have learned their lesson.  They will make one too many mistakes like this and will get into some sort of trouble, legally or otherwise somewhere along the line. I am reminded of the old Oriental proverb:  The dogs may bark but the caravan moves on.  I don't think most people interested in autism ever took the neurodiversity movement very seriously.  Hopefully this new faux pas will make them look all the sillier.  The caravan of autism speaks doing research in the hopes of finding a cure for this dreadful disorder will move on, in spite of all the barking dogs.  However, it would seem that this new episode in the neurodiversity movement versus autism speaks will prove that it's bark is worse than it's bite.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/06/neurodiversity-faux-pas-acknowledged.html", "title": "\nneurodiversity faux pas acknowledged: But will they learn their lesson\n"},
{"date": " June 12, 2008", "body": "\nJB Handley in his latest post on the age of autism website is claiming that he has documentation from the state of California showing a correlation between DTP vaccination rates between the early 1980s and 1990s and increasing prevalence of autism rates in the state of California.He presents his data here: http://www.putchildrenfirst.org/media/4.6.pdfHere is the data that I received from the state of California a couple of years ago when I asked about rates of DTP vaccination uptake: http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/dtpcoverage.xlsThis is supposed to be the same data from the same group of children who received four DTP shots before going to kindergarten.You can see the huge differences in the numbers however. Handley's data suggests that in children born during the early to mid 1980s the vaccination rates were very low, lower than 50% or about 50% in some cases.You can see in the data that I received from the state of California is quite different from JB Handley's showing these vaccination rates are at least 85% or higher in this same group of children. Perhaps there is an explanation for Handley's data being so different from mine, I don't know. Handley is suggesting that this data resulted in some sort of CDC cover-up because it would show a huge correlation between DTP vaccination rates and increases in autism.Of course one problem with Handley's assessment is autism prevalence increases are not just restricted to California but autism prevalence increased all over the United States. Prior to 1991 the DTP vaccine was the only thimerosal containing vaccine used in the United States. Therefore Handley would have to come up with figures showing increases in uptake nation wide. Surveys taken by the CDC contradict this notion here: http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/Simpson4SurveysAJPM2001.pdfOf course it is my word against Handley's a stanford graduate millionaire businessman, and me a humble autism sufferer, unemployed blogger who never did amount to much due to his disability. Handley neglects to explain why, if his figures are real and in fact did come from the state of California why there would not have been a decrease in pertussis rates in children of this age. Since it would presumably be no more than 1/150 children who were sensitive to the vaccines the pertussis decrease would have to have been of a much greater magnitude than the autism increase. If there is any evidence of a decrease in pertussis Handley does not show it. In fact pertussis during those years has been on a slight upswing nationwide shown here: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/dis-faqs.htm  This link also shows how dramatically pertussis decreased when the vaccine was introduced in the 1940's.  All of these things are completely inconsistent with Handley's data. Could it be Handley and his follows have some sort of interest  in this.  Generation rescue, the organization Handley started has the quick fix simplistic solution of curing autism through chelation.  At least in the past, they claimed that autism was just another name for mercury poisoning.  I do not know if Handley's letter from Dale Lorings to Diane Simpson is real or not.  Only that it is totally inconsistent with the data I received from the state of california, the lack of decrease in pertussis during this same period and the increases in autism prevalence throughout the u.s. in spite of slightly decreasing rates of uptake nationwide in the CDC survey that I linked to above. I think Handley should give a better explaination of his statistics.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.putchildrenfirst.org/media/4.6.pdf", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/dtpcoverage.xls", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/Simpson4SurveysAJPM2001.pdf", "http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/dis-faqs.htm"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/06/jb-handley-my-data-from-california-are.html", "title": "\nJB Handley my data from California are sure different from yours\n"},
{"date": " January 21, 2008", "body": "\nWhen I would write in my journal on my web page some people seemed to express a concern that they were not able to comment on my web page. The way my journal was set up on my web page I was not able to enable comments, though I did try with some reluctance. One of the reasons I decided to get this new blog, which I am still waiting to get my first comment on was so that all of these people who wanted to comment could have an opportunity to comment. Also, the blogspot blog on Jonathan's journal did not have the appearance of others and it did not have the archiving features and things like that.  I was new to blogging with comments after I got this blog and was concerned about not being able to delete comments if I thought they were over the line and attacking so I regretfully pushed for comment moderation as I have seen done on some other blogs that do this on a routine basis. I then wrote a comment under these conditions about Michelle Dawson seeming to ascribe a lot of ideas that I wrote in an article urging people to reject the concept of neurodiversity that I never expressed in the article. I also questioned why she and her research associates could not apply their concepts that autism is not a tragedy and autistics intelligence has been underestimated etc, clinically and show positive outcomes based on research harnessing all of these hidden abilities that they allege autistics have. Then she seemed to be concerned that I would censor her comments since I had the comment moderation on. I have now turned the moderation off so that I can encourage people to comment here. Michelle still does not want to seem to comment here though I have now made every effort to accommodate her.  She and her friend Jypsy are still saying things about me that are not true.Jypsy has asked me to provide an example of baseless comments she has made about me so I will accommodate her here but not on Michelle's TMOB board. She claims that I could not back up my claims that there were persons in the neurodiversity movement who claimed that most if not all people felt as they did. This is untrue. I only conceded that saying that the word consensus may have been a bad choice of words and that the use of the term all may have been a mistake. I only said \"a number\" of persons in my article. This could have multiple meanings. it could mean some it could mean many. Jypsy had asked me in public blogs and private emails to back up my statements with examples. I did give her a number of examples on more than one occasion which included the writings of Dawn Prince Hughes in her book Song of a Gorilla nation and John Robisson's book look me in the eye. I also gave her a number of examples of this way of thinking that was pervasive in the usenet newsgroup alt.support.autism that I used to post on several years ago. I only conceded that I may not have phrased things as well as I could and perhaps I should have said some or certain individuals rather than saying \"a number\" instead of saying all maybe i should have said they ascribe this to most people or in some cases all people. This would have been a more accurate statement and i hope this clarifies it. Jypsy's statement that I could not back up my assertions is absolutely false and a baseless statement.Michelle also is now claiming that I deliberately lied about jypsy's family. When I first started corresponding with Jypsy via email she told me about a son who was diagnosed with asperger's at age 9. Then on the TMOB comment board she stated her son was severely autistic at 3 and unable to speak. I thought at the time she was talking about the same person, so I asked her to explain these inconsitencies. Apparently Jypsy has four children and at least two sons who are different people both with different types of ASD's. I had no way of knowing this at the time. I never accused her of being a liar contrary to what Michelle is printing on the TMOB board.Jypsy seemed to think that I had a different definition of neurodiversity than Michelle and wanted to know what my take on it is. My take is not that it is a movement attempting to acquire human rights but in reality is claiming that autism and perhaps other neurologic conditions are not really disorders but a different way of brain wiring. They are claiming that there is no need to find a cure or even medicalize these conditions in any manner and if the right accommodations are made for these people it will solve everything. I hope this clarifies things for Jypsy.Michelle also seems to feel that I am being omniscient by stating that I believe that if people with Down's syndrome don't feel that they have a disorder and nothing is wrong with them are engaging in denial and reaction formation defense mechanisms. I only stated this as opinion and this is my assessment of the situation. I never stated it as absolute fact. This does seem to me to be the most likely explaination.If Michelle and others are concerned about censorship because they had no way to comment on my previous blog and I regretfully enabled comment moderation when i first got this blog, I have made every effort to accommodate them. They still want to seem to attack me on their own turf and not comment on this blog here even though they can freely comment here and have their comments printed here immediately without my approval.I find this concern about censorship most interesting as it seems to me if there is a huge pattern and history of internet censorship it has been practiced by those in the neurodiversity and anti-cure movements. This occurred on Jim Sinclair's ANI list where comments that autism was a disability or any sort of bad thing were not allowed and people would be first given a warning and then kicked off the list for a second offense. Amanda Baggs at autistics.org also engaged in this practice claiming that censorship just meant that the government would intercede and not allow anyone to print their own newspaper but they were not engaging in censorship as people could start their own lists or blogs. Well I have done that here. Also, I remember one person in the autism support usenet group, which she was only a participant and had no role in starting state that comments wanting to cure autism or labeling autism as an affliction were not welcome in \"autistic friendly space\" It seems to me a double standard is operating here. I suppose I will get a negative comment eventually from someone as I have just started this blog. I don't know if I will get one from Michelle or not though I have made every effort to accommodate her. Hopefully I will get some positive and supportive ones also.In the meantime it seems that a guy just can't win.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/01/still-waiting-for-comments-guy-cant-win.html", "title": "\nstill waiting for comments a guy can't win\n"},

They are among the many parents of autistic children whose tears for toasted snow will most likely not be fulfilled.  Many of these parents, including Dr. Chew and her husband insist that ABA be included in their autistic child's IEP-a treatment that promises a coin-flip probability of complete normalcy for the autistic child.  Naturally, they present no adult outcomes in the peer reviewed literature, only informally at conferences, where I am unable to look at their results.  I emailed Tristram Smith, Ivar Lovaas' heir apparent, asking him if he could email details of these conferences and if they would ever publish a study presenting adult outcomes.  I was told that they wanted to publish their adult outcomes but \"logistical problems\", whatever that means, prevented them from doing so, but he emailed me a power point file about the conference.  It turned out the file he emailed me just was a list of tests they gave the research subjects and nothing else.  My friend Stephen Shore suggested that I email Dr. Smith and ask him for something more, but I just did not have the inclination to do so.I still wonder why these logistical problems would prevent them from publishing in the peer reviewed literature in spite of the huge NIMH funding they have received specifically to study adult outcomes in the research subjecs that the wrote about in their 1987 study but not prevent them from making presentations at conferences.

I have dealt with this in my article \"Autism genetics: Is my suffering necessary to society\" at www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html .  I suggested that spontaneous mutations may have played a role rather than their being any advantage to any autism genes. I have just read the article in scientific american dealing with autism genetics.  They talk about a geneticist named Michael Wigler who has collaborated with Jonathan Sebat, one of the geneticists who showed that spontaneous mutations play a role in autism.  The article contains some other interesting things in addition to Wigler's assertation that spontaneous mutations play a role in autism.  He also states that females may carry the genes for autism which are then passed onto their children.  Wigler states that some damaged genes have a higher risk factors for males. These mutations can stay in the population and then die out after a few generations.  They, persist, however, because the female carriers have modifying genes that protect them from getting autism, but pass it on to their more vulnerable male offspring.  This is an intriguing idea.  Not only does it seem to provide further ammunition against the arguments of Grandin and Baron-Cohen but it would also refute the arguments of the persons who belive mercury poisoning causes autism and that the estrogen in girls provides a protective effect.  It would also refute the evidence of some of my female friends in the neurodiversity movement who insist that there is parity between autism in the sexes but that autism is underascertained in females for one reason or another.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/01/temple-grandin-simon-baron-cohen-theory.html", "title": "\nTemple Grandin Simon Baron Cohen theory of evolution redux\n"},

She is quit mistaken. I am for rights for handicapped people. I am for wheelchair access for handicapped people and I would probably be for the accommodations Ms. Dawson was not alloted for on her job, that she claims i am opposed to. I was even more shocked to find out that I want to prevent autistic people from trying to stop people from attending segretated special education schools. This seems strange in light of the fact that on my webpage and in usenet news groups and in other writings. I have presented some of the most anti-special ed opinions imaginable. I have favored abolition of the IDEA and I have stated that I am opposed to spending on ABA at taxpayer expense. I have also advocated mainstreaming and regular education for developmentally disabled persons whenever possible. I have also taken the ABA proponents to task on what I felt were their poorly done studies She and her friend janet norman bain (aka Jypsy) seem to be upset that I recently wrote an unfavorable piece about neurodiversity. Jypsy took me to task for saying that a consensus exists among a number of high functioning autistic persons feel that all autistic people feel the way they do. I conceded that perhaps this was a poor phrasing in an informal blog entry and perhaps I should have said a number of autistic persons seemed to think most (rather than all) shared their views. Consensus may have been a poor choice for a word.Ms. Dawson's arguments on her comment board are very typical of those who have this point of view. They want to put words in people's mouth without debating any of the facts. By trying to evade the issue of their problematic philosophy by making false statements about me claiming i am opposed to human rights and I want all autistic persons to cease to exist. It is interesting that if i felt that way i should have committed suicide by now rather than writing this blog entry. This is similar to the strawman arguments about cure and prevention really being code words for abortion.Does being against neurodiversity mean being against human rights for disabled people. No it certainly does not. It means I don't believe that autism is merely a different way of being, I wish there could be a cure for autism, and I don't believe in the viewpoint of Ms. Dawson and others that accommodations can be made for autistics and they will perform as well as others. Ms. Dawson does research apparently trying to show that autistic intelligence is underestimated because of discrimination and because instruments such as the Wechsler IQ test do not provide a valid measurement. Perhaps she has a good point and many autistic persons deemed cognitively impaired have hidden abilities that we never imagined, I really don't know.Ms. Dawson, unlike myself is aligned with Ph.D. academic researchers such as lauren mottron Morton Gernsbacher and others. She publishes work in peer reviewed journals such as JADD. It seems in her writings that she is a stickler for scientific rigor and the practice of peer review. I will never be in a position to do controlled studies and provide empirical evidence for any of my viewpoints, therefore Michelle has certain advantages that I don't have. If autistics really don't need a cure and they are capable of functioning ably in a society that allows them to use their hidden abilities that she suggests they have, I suggest that she and her colleagues start providing empirical evidence in the research literature for such. They have the opportunity to show that harnessing these abilities autistics were never known to have before will enable them to be successful in heterosexual relationships and marry, will enable them to complete college and graduate and professional schools and have satisfying careers. Will enable them to have good handwriting and motor coordination for those like me who have this impairment will be able to perform. They will cease to be disruptive in public places make untoward sexual advances towards people as one autistic person i know does, they won't bite themselves or engage in self-injurious behavior, etc. They can also provide the adult outcomes in the peer reviewed literature that lovaas and company have failed to provide in spite of being given NIMH funding to do so and have just presented these findings informally at conferences. I look forward to seeing Ms. Dawson's results in the peer reviewed literature.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/01/does-being-against-neurodiversity-mean.html", "title": "\nDoes being against neurodiversity mean being against human rights for the disabled?\n"},
{"date": " January 23, 2008", "body": "\nI have just received an email that on tonight's nightline, there is going to be a program claiming that autism has been underdiagnosed in girls. This has also been posted on the Age of Autism web page. The literature has consistently reported a 4:1 ratio of autism in boys as opposed to girls. The topic of tonight's nightline show is not a spanking brand new idea. This has been a topic that has been proposed many times, often by females with autism. They claim that the 4:1 ratio is a myth. That girls are more sociable than boys. They do a better job of hiding their autism. Or diagnostic substitution exists and they are diagnosed as something else. This was also proposed by Ivar Lovaas and Tristram Smith when Ralph Boyd criticized Lovaas' famous 1987 study claiming that it was not a representative sample of autistics and that the bias of having so many girls in Lovaas' control group as opposed to the experimental group could account for the results of his study. This is because autism in girls is often more severe than in boys. It seems strange to see this post on the Age of Autism's web page and in the email list that the organization unlocking autism has. The reason it is strange is because this view is usually espoused by some of their biggest detractors, the anti-curebie neurodiversity people. The neurodiversity group is often very critical of the mercury causes autism crowd because they want a cure for their disabled children with chelation therapy and other treatments of extremely dubious value. I believe these parents are well-intentioned though misguided.I suppose I am getting a little off-topic here, so back to the original topic at hand. One of the reasons this alleged argument is so interesting is that the neurodiversity proponents at times often seem to imply that they are representative of all autistics. Sometimes they speak for all autistics. This phenomena has been noted by Harold Doherty's The Royal We post at http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/ I notice that it would seem that an extremely disproportionate number, probably more than 50% of these people are of the female gender. One can look at the postings of neurodiversity people on the internet and see how many females there are. If the allegations that autism is more common in girls than previously thought is true then perhaps neurodiversity's proponents might be more representative of those on the autistic spectrum than I thought. If these people are mistaken, then the predominence of females in the neurodiversity movement would seem to me to be problematic if they claimed that they were any sort of \"real voice of autism\" as autistics.org implies. It would mean they were less representative of autistics, so that their experiences would not mirror a typical autistic person, who would in reality have an 80% probability of being a male.Though the internet seems to have a pervasive population of autistic females I know that in AGUA, the autism support group that I helped to start with Jerry Newport and some other people back in 1993 has at least a 10:1 ratio if not higher of males to females. This is greater than what is often presented in the literature. Though, some of the literature indicates that the ratio may be as high as 10:1 in the higher functioning groups as autistic females are often more severely afflicted than males as I mentioned previouslyThis is one thing that compels me not only to believe that neurodiversity is not a very representative sample of autistic people but that the arguments of Brenda Myles Smith and others who will appear on tonight's show are incorrect.Michael Wigler, a geneticist who was written about in this month's issue of scientific american has a theory that females have a protective mechanism that would often make them the carrier for genes that could account for autism, but be less likely to give them the condition themself. Therefore, they could pass the gene on to their offspring but not end up being autistic.Let's look at the diagnostic substitution argument that autistic females are often diagnosed as something else. I am curious as to what they are diagnosed as? Are they diagnosed having ADHD? Are they diagnosed as having dyslexia? What about stutterers? I suppose it is possible they will be more specific and answer the question on tonight's show, so I guess I will have to watch it to find out what the answer to that question is. After I watch the show, I may have to post an addendum to this post. However, this issue is of such great interest to me I could not curb my enthusiasm and had to post something about it today-before the show airs tonight. The problem with the diagnostic substitution argument is that not only has there been reported a 4:1 ratio of autistic boys to girls. The 4:1 ratio has also been reported in the above-named conditions as well. Here is one reference to the 4:1 ratio in stutterers http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1288304This would tend to negate the diagnostic substitution of argument of myles smith and others as this would mean there would be either parity in these other conditions between boys and girls or at least all of these undiagnosed girls with autism would end up being diagnosed as dyslexics, stutterers, etc. and the ratio would at least be substantially lower than 4:1 in these conditions.  If these autistic girls were being diagnosed with something else there would have to be some sort of zero sum effect.  The consistencies of ratios across conditions compels me to believe no such zero sum effect exists.  The next question is are dyslexia, ADHD, stuttering etc. underdiagnosed in girls also? How do the social arguments, ability to pass, less aggressive than boys arguments hold up for these conditions?  What substitute diagnosis are these people given?  This would also seem to negate that argument. How would female stutterers be able to hide their condition and pass for nonstutterers? Does this mean that reading problems in girls is not noticed. I am very curious to the answers to these questions?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/", "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1288304"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/01/is-autism-more-common-in-girls-than.html", "title": "\nIs Autism more common in girls than previously thought\n"},

I believe that both parents of autistic children and those who cling to a belief in neurodiversity should learn this prayer and repeat it to themselves and take it to heart in their own lives. For those of them who are either atheists or agnostics (this includes myself actually) the word God could be omitted and it could be called a saying instead of a prayer. Parents of autistic children cling to figurative opiates like ABA as a treatment that will make their children completely normal in spite of the evidence to the contrary. They cling to a belief that thimerosal causes autism, not because of any scientific evidence but rather because it gives them the hope that some sort of treatment could be found on the basis of this etiology. They lobby for flawed laws like IDEA because of the mistaken belief that their children will get some sort of benefit.Proponents of neurodiversity cling to the flawed notion that autistics need acceptance and not cure and that if society would only change to accommodate autistics, autism would not be a problem. The autism is still there and no problems are solved by this philosophy. Many parents of autistics and most persons who preach neurodiversity would be better off just accepting the things they cannot change. Whether the parents like it or not, their children will always be autistic, these treatments and flawed theories of etiology with the promise of a quick fix won't help them. They need to accept the things they cannot change. This does not mean all is lost, they might with certain types of teaching their children and being loving parents and raising their children to the best of their abilities, but be able to help their children achieve maybe more than they would without their parents trying to do the best for them, but it will take courage to apply this philosophy. It will take courage for those who believe in neurodiversity to stop bad mouthing parents and charity organizations run by people who only want a better life for their kids. It will take courage for the neurodiversity people to stop using psychologic defense mechanisms like denial and reaction formation and to just accept that their autism is really a medical (not social) disability and not just an alternative life-style or culture.Above all, these people need to have the wisdom to know the difference between what they can or cannot change. Though their autistic children may be able to get somewhat better and overcome some obstacles, they won't be able to function as well as the parents would like in most cases. I don't think I can comment on wisdom as it relates to neurodiversity as it would just make me too angry and I would be accused of trying to start a flame war with anyone who happens to read this post who thinks that autism is just a social disability and not a medical one and who thinks that autism research to look for a cure or at least help those as much as possible is wrong or immoral or does not need to be done, so i will let it go at that.Again, with the God part omitted for all of the non-believers out there.Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/03/serenity-prayer.html", "title": "\nThe serenity prayer\n"},
{"date": " April 9, 2008", "body": "\nLately, I have been reading the multiple blog entries by those in the neurodiversity camp protesting the subpoena of neurodiversity.com owner Kathleen Seidel, by one of the lawyers involved in anti-vaccine litigation for one of the members of the mercury militia. I was also reading a blog by someone who calls themselves Axinar who was blogging about this ongoing feud. I really have no comment on the subpoena one way or the other as I don't really know all the details as I do not know whether or not this attorney is really just trying to harass Ms. Seidel as some proponents of neurodiversity seem to believe. I have also been reading the famous John Best's vitriolically profane diatribes on the matter also. He seems to want nothing less than the electric chair for any member of neurodiversity.What I am more interested in commenting about is the irony of the whole situation. Those in the mercury militia and neurodiversity seem very much alike to me in many respects.Those who belong to the mercury militia, particularly people like Best, J.B. Handley and others who are part of the organization Generation Rescue have it all figured out, or at least so they think. The answer is really easy. Autism is just another name for mercury poisoning. Autistic people are not really permanently damaged, they just have too much mercury floating about in their brains from vaccines, pollution from coal burning plants dental amalgams or other mercury-containing sources. The solution we are told is easy. Autism is curable through a treatment called chelation where chemical agents bind to the mercury that is in the autistic's brain and removes it. When this occurs they are cured, problem solved. A vexing problem which scientists have been researching for a few decades has an easy answer that those working in these labs and receiving millions of dollars in taxpayer and private sector grants were apparently too moronic to think of. If we only listen to JB, and the rest of the generation rescue entourage. Autism will no longer be a problem, everyone with the condition will be cured by chelation.Those in neurodiversity have their own easy simple solution. Autism is not really a disability, at least not a medical one. It is only a societal disability in that society is too prejudiced to accommodate these people who are only just wired slightly differently. These same scientists, and organizations like autism speaks who are so despised by the mercury militia are equally abhorred by those who advocate neurodiversity. They are just wasting their time. If society would only make the necessary accommodations for these people, would stop being so bigoted and would only forget their genocidal ambitions to cure autism, autistic people would no longer be at a disadvantage. They would be able to do everything that the neurotypical can do, problem solved.These groups have much more in common then they ever dreamed of. This is why both opposing camps have so much animosity towards autism speaks and other neuroscientists and geneticists struggling so hard to find answers for this baffling disorder. What a bunch of cretins these geneticists and neuroscientists who are working their asses off for nothing are!! All this work and money flushed down the toilet. After all, two groups of people have these easy solutions that make their jobs and their grants utterly superfluous. one group says that if chelation is done all this is unnecessary. The other says, societal acceptance will solve everything. If either side is correct, these scientists will be out of a job.As the few regular readers of my writings and the few fans I do have know, I don't agree with either camp. But I can't help getting a kick of the irony of how similar the two organizations are.One organization spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on advertising in USA today and other newspapers just to convert lost souls who are first learning that their 3 year old child has this condition.Neurodiversity, as I have mentioned before, are not unlike christian missionaries, trying to find lost souls, disaffected by society to convert to their viewpoint.Is it possible that both groups manage to get members on one side or the other because both provide easy, albeit different, answers to this problem?I wonder who is wasting time, the geneticists and neuroscientists who are trying to find some real answers for autism, hoping that they can find a real cure once and for all or these two groups of people so diametrically opposed to each other but ironically enough so similar in so many respects.In some ways I envy the two groups. My life has been made so hard by this disability. I have had to accept many times that my tears for toasted snow of having a better life have not been answered. These two groups in their convictions know that things could be so much easier if only people would be converted to their positions. Autism would never be a problem for anyone.I feel though I must be realistic in assessing the situation. I do not believe there are quick fixes or easy answers to autism, so I am going to have to be frustrated. However, my frustration can be mitigated slightly by laughing at the humor of the similarities between these two warring entities.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/04/mercury-militia-versus-neurodiversity.html", "title": "\nMercury Militia versus Neurodiversity, an ironic war between two adversaries\n"},
{"date": " April 4, 2008", "body": "\nWrong Planet founder, Alex Plank, was recently interviewed and stated what is the point of view of at least some (if you are reading this Jypsy I am qualifying my statements with some so as not to be misleading) persons with autism spectrum disorders that all or at least most persons with autism do not want to be cured.  I am not sure where he gets that number unless it is the relatively small sample of persons who congregate on his web page out of all the autistics in the whole world most of whom are far more severely disabled than probably most of the denizens of wrong planet.net. Plank, is going to college doing well and has a girfriend.  I am 52, never had one, probably never will.  I suspect my other problems aside from the girl situation are more severe than his.  I must disagree with him.  I do want to be cured.  I also know of sue rubin, someone who calls herself droopy, tom mckean and others who want to be cured.  There are some others who I won't name as they may not want their privacy violated who also want a cure and reject the notion of neurodiversity. I am quite curious where Plank gets the idea that all or most don't want a cure.  Again, I will use the analogy that i used in my article, neurodiversity just say no, of the poller taking a poll in Biloxi, Mississippi and coming to the conclusion that at least 99% of all Americans want John McCain to be president of the United States, want to bring back a military draft, want to outlaw abortion and bring back prayer in the schools.  This is the type of reasoning Plank and the other persons who make this claim are using.One of the sad truths is that most of the autistics who do want a cure have never had an internet blog or have no way of posting on the internet and never will.  They don't have the education or functioning level or inclination to write blog posts or post comments on other people's blogs.  If Plank thinks that no one on the spectrum will rebut his claims he is sadly mistaken.  I am on record of saying I wish there could be a cure for autism.  Again, I urge anyone who is proposed by a neurodiversity adherent to just say no to neurodiversity. In the event that you happen to read this, Alex, perhaps you can tell me where you get your figure of \"most\" autistics not wanting to be cured.  Have you taken any sort of scientific poll of a cross section of autistics.  Even if you have.  What about all of the autistics who are unable to talk or communicate in any way?  How can they tell you, they want a cure?  My friend, neuroscientist Matthew Belmonte's brother has a very limited ability to communicate using facilited communcation.  He has communicated to Matthew  that he does not like his autism and wants to be cured.  You have to factor this in also, Alex.  I am still waiting to find out where this idea comes from, from at least some persons on the spectrum that most or all don't want a cure.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/04/damn-it-alex-some-of-us-want-to-be.html", "title": "\ndamn it, Alex, some of us want to be cured\n"},
{"date": " May 26, 2008", "body": "\nAn article about neurodiversity has just come out in New York magazine. I just finished reading it and I am pleased to announce that yours truly got a brief mention in the article and author Andrew Solomon quoted a sentence or two from my article \"Neurodiversity: Just Say No\" It was an interesting article and fairly well-balanced, though seems a slight bias towards the ND side of the story.I was not mentioned until close to the end of the article.  so  wondered if someone whose diagnosis would be autism (even high functioning) rather than asperger's syndrome would be mentioned.   I also wondered if any mention would be made of autistic adults who have tried to make a living and the problems that so often happens to those of us on the spectrum who are too disabled to be continually \"substantially and gainfully employed\". The reason I was concerned about this were that Mr. Solomon's shining examples were Ari neeman and Alex Plank, two individuals diagnosed with asperger's syndrome rather than autism, neither of whom, at least in my book, should be considered an adult. They are both under 21, are still developing college students and are not yet old or mature enough to have attempted to go out in the world and make a living at a serious job, so the problems that many of us on the spectrum have of holding down a job are really an abstraction to these two. Once they finish school and are adults, they will have to think about supporting themselves, which might be difficult for them if their asperger's significantly impairs them. It is not unthinkable, they might come around to my viewpoint, once they understand the real problems autistic adults face. I seem to remember also both of these individuals were diagnosed quite late in childhood. I also wonder if Alex Plank has ever been in a special education setting. I have been told by Michelle Dawson and Ari himself that he has been a special ed student. So I am still waiting to hear about someone who is an adult,  gone out in the world tried to make a living has an ASD disorder that involved a speech delay  and was a special ed student as I was who is a neurodiversity proponent.I was also reading the left brain/right brain blog's author Keven Leitch, who now seems to have come around to the prospect that a cure might not be so bad, but might actually not be necessary, though he gives no alternatives to a cure that might help an autistic. But Kev seems to say, he would not get in the way of a cure if there could be a cure. A long way from the \"we don't need no stinkin' cure\" motto of the autism hub that they apparently changed for some mysterious reason to something about acceptance of autistic people.Kathleen Seidel seems to say that she is not opposed to treatments being found for people with autism so she does not seem to think that autism is not all joy and beauty, so this may be another example of one neurodiversity proponent trying to have it both ways.Alex Plank, does make some sense in that he says that since there is no cure there is no point in arguing about it, but wants something done for the autistic people on this planet now whom with his alleged asperger's diagnosis i don't think he has much in common with. But we also have to think about the lives of children who will be born in the future and what we can do to ensure they will not have to suffer from all the hardships an ASD can bring. This is why the work of autism speaks and other organizations are so important.On the subject of autism speaks, i was very disappointed to again read Ari Neeman as being quoted that autism speaks is complicit in the murders of autistic children just because of one dumb remark one person associated with the organization made in a video. It is unfortunate this kind of demagoguery has to be used by these people to justify their otherwise unjustifiable position.Lenny Schaefer was saying don't write about these people, we don't need to give them publicity. Though I find neurodiversity as distasteful as Mr. Schaefer (though I don't agree with him on vaccines causing autism and the likelihood of a true rise of autism), I don't believe he is correct on this. Neurodiversity is no less of a fringe movement than people who believe the earth is flat and at some point, when they start getting more publicity people will see how silly their position truly is. I hope then at some point that parents of newly diagnosed children will reject this movement. I hope this will motivate people to find medical solutions to autism.I realize that Plank's point about we want something done for autistics who are here now may be well taken. It is true, that the scientific research that autism speaks funds may not provide beneficial treatments let alone cures for people with autism in our lifetime, though as I said in the previous paragraph we do have to think about future generations. However, what can be done for the autistic persons on this planet now? I wish I had some easy quick fix answers but I don't. However, I don't believe that ABA, poorly thought out laws like the IDEA and the IEPs (Idiotic Expectations Programs) are any answer. I also don't believe that acceptance, preaching neurodiversity provide any answers to autism either. Also societal acceptance certainly provide no answer to nonspeaking head-banging autistics whose problems neurodiversity proponents won't seem to acknowledge. Therefore I hope that people will reject this way of thinking. I also hope that pieces like those published in the New York Magazine will allow those to see for themselves what a misguided movement this is and will lead people to reject it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/05/neurodiversity-article-in-new-york.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity article in New York Magazine\n"},

{"date": " June 6, 2008", "body": "\nOne of the proposals that some neurodiversity advocates make in terms of what they believe to be necessary changes to looking at autism in a different light is rewriting the DSMIV-R, which I think soon will be the DSMV if it is not already.  The proposal is to eliminate autism entirely as a category in the psychiatric manual.  They believe it is insulting to pathologize autism in any way.  They use the analogy of homosexuality being considered a disorder in the 1960s and then being removed from the DSM.  I believe the analogies between the two are poor.  Homosexuality certainly does not cause the individual to be dysfunctional in society the way autism does.  I can't believe that even the staunchest neurodiversity advocate would claim that any autistic could function normally in society.  Be that as it may, perhaps changing the DSM in some other ways might not be such a bad idea. I was reading Michelle Dawson's TMOB comment board and was intrigued by the following comment from Michelle:E.g., Dr Shattuck trots out the common and stupefying premise that when autistics are bullied, this is evidence of autistics'--not bullies'-- inappropriate social behaviour. I nearly turned the radio off.Later Dr Shattuck also states that there should be criminal penalties for those who deliberately take advantage of developmentally disabled people. This is interesting, but there is no suggestion that bullies and harassers (etc.) and others who take advantage of autistics, etc., need treatment for their grossly inappropriate social behaviour. Instead, Dr Shattuck wants a lot of treatment for autistics who get bullied and taken advantage of, presumably so we become less autistic or not autistic at all (this being the purpose of autism treatment). Though Michelle and I have had our differences in the past and have locked figurative horns on some matters, I believe in this instance Michelle has some valid points.  However the argument Michelle seems to be espousing is treatment of autistics and non-treatment of bullies versus treatment of bullies and non-treatment of autistics.  However, why can't there be a third scenario where not only is autism considered a pathologic condition but so is bullying amongst children.  I don't believe there is any reason there has to be mutual exclusion from considering either one condition or the other pathologic.  One of the arguments against mainstreaming special education students is that they will be picked on by bullies in mainstream schools.  Of course it is never recommended that the bully be disciplined or sent to a special education school.  Also, people who espouse this argument have probably never been special education students themselves and don't know the same things that this eight year veteran of special education knows, that special ed students do bully each other at times. So my suggestion is this.  Not only do we keep autism as a DSM category but add bullying as well.  Though I am not sure what treatment would turn a bullier into a non-bully, assuming there was one and the criminal charges that Dr. Shattuck recommends, one of the conditions of sentencing could be that a bully is referred to a psychiatrist or appropriate doctor for treatment under the DSM.  Though such a treatment may be pie-in-the-sky dreaming, I believe it would be a good idea to add bullying into the DSM category so that this behavior can be considered pathologic and the consciousness of person's would be raised in terms of the problems that autistic children who are often bullied both in and out of mainstream schools have to endure. I have had to endure tremendous bullying, have been beaten up and even had my car vandalized as a high school teen.  Of course not all kids are like this.  There is no question that the most extreme bullies had some sort of psychiatric issues and would need help if such help were available.  Just as people arrested for DUI have to sometimes undergo counseling as a condition for their probation perhaps bullies could also. This does not mean of course that autistic persons should not be made less autistic or even non-autistic if the option is available.  Autism presents many challenges for the person outside of having to contend with bullies. Another needed change to the DSM in my opinion is either eliminating Asperger's syndrome alltogether or at least making it its own separate category and not considering it as part of the autism spectrum.  The Autism Self Advocacy Network is not called the Asperger's Self Advocacy Network.  Ari Neeman, the young stalwart who runs this organization never had a speech delay, one of the DSM indicators of autism.  He was not diagnosed with Asperger's until he was 12.  He is now 20 years old.  At the time Ari was 7, he would not have been diagnosable as autistic under the criteria which was in existence at that time.  This is probably also true for many other neurodiversity advocates who in some instance seem to want to speak for all autistics and protest a non-existent cure for autism.  I had a speech delay before the age of 3, so I guess according to DSM criteria I would be considered autistic rather than asperger's, though I suppose I have some commonality with Asperger's in that I am clumsy and score relatively well on the verbal portion of Wechsler IQ tests and poorly on the performance part.  The inclusion of Asperger's also gives the false perception that 1 out of 150 persons in the U.S. have conditions that are in any way analogous to people on the lower end of the spectrum (this could even include myself in comparison to many if not most neurodiversity adherents who claim to be autistic). For all of these reasons I recommend changing the DSM as soon as possible.  Include bullying, either exclude Asperger's or make it separate from autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/06/bullying-and-aspergers-some-needed.html", "title": "\nBullying and Aspergers: Some needed changes to the DSM\n"},
{"date": " May 27, 2008", "body": "\nI recently posted a comment on the left brain/right brain blog in response to blogger Kevin Leitch's comments that though he might not stand in the way of a cure, he was not sure it would be necessary as there might be some alternatives. As is so typical of those involved in the neurodiversity movement, he neglected to give any specifics. In response, I asked what alternatives are there. The only person who responded to my question and gave any answer was Joseph of the natural variation blog. He stated that we should study the successful adult outcomes and see what influenced them. I did respond to him, but one point that I did not but should have made in my response was that this might be a legitimate thing to do, however, if we could find what influenced the adult outcomes and modify the environment or diet or whatever factors might lead to these outcomes assuming they exist(which is questionable) and the person was able to live a normal (or typical for those who prefer that word) life why would they not be cured? I also asked that question of Kevin in my original post. It seems to me that Joe and Kev just want to have it both ways, which is not an uncommon phenomena for those who preach neurodiversity.Another person diagnosed me with clinical depression and suggested that i get some sort of treatment for this. I guess it is inconceivable to some that a person can be depressed because their autistic symptoms have so greatly impaired their life and made it so difficult.One of the most, in my opinion, interesting responses was from someone who calls herself alyric who accused me of making one big whine and saying my whining does not accomplish anything.If anyone holds the records for the most non-productive whining in the world it is those who are involved with neurodiversity. They take umbrage to someone using a ransom note metaphor concerning autism and spend their time complaining about something so silly and quashing this, pressuring the New York University person to pull these ads. They whine about a non-existent cure which even if it did exist, no one is proposing they be forced to take it against their will. It does not seem to occur to them these parents who wish their children could be cured have no interest in curing them, just their own children. They whine about organizations like autism speaks accusing them of bigotry and genocide. They whine about the direction tax payer funded research should take. Interestingly enough, I am pretty sure two of these whiners, Michelle Dawson and Mike Stanton have never paid a dime in American taxes yet feel they should have a say on how U.S. tax dollar research should be funded.They whine about the murders of autistic children like katie McCarron and blame anyone who wants a cure for those murders. Yet they shed no tears for children like Ashley Brock who recently drowned most likely due to being autistic. They shed no tears for the boy who was killed by a train in North Carolina due to being too autistic to know the danger.They whine about parents saying autism is any sort of deficiency or pathology or bad thing.They attempt to engage in petty censorship claiming that publically funded usenet newsgroups are \"autistic friendly space\" saying anyone who posts anything negative about autism is violating them. Steve D., one neurodiversity activitist, complains when someone posts a link to my article \"neurodiversity just say no\" in the autism speaks newsgroups because he is offended by it. Yet it is okay for them to post all sorts of things that undoubtedly offend other people.All I can say to Alyric and other neurodiversity proponents is, \"would you like some cheese with that whine?\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/05/would-you-like-some-cheese-with-that.html", "title": "\nwould you like some cheese with that whine department\n"},
{"date": " June 8, 2008", "body": "\nMany autism afficianados in the blogosphere have heard of the notorious John Best, the pontificator of angry invective about autism really being mercury poisoining and chelation being the cure. Also the pontificator of anti-neurodiversity diatribes, more drastic than yours truly, one of the few bloggers to have the audacity to write unfavorable things about that sacred cow to many, neurodiversity.I don't agree with Best about mercury causing autism and chelation being the cure.  I don't really approve of a lot of his harsh tactics either.  However I have to admit to sometimes taking a guilty pleasure of reading his blog and occasionally posting comments there to get the anger I have towards the neurodiversity movement out of my system as well as the fact the blog provides a sort of Three Stooges slapstick entertainment with all the back and forth bickering between Best, his entourage who usually post anonymously and may be Best themselves in some cases, and his neurodiversity detractors who often don't seem to want to turn the other cheek.Lately the controversy involving the hating autism blog has reached a pinnacle of sorts with someone posting the address of one of neurodiversity's poster children, the famous Amanda Baggs. Amanda has often been a subject of the hating autism blog as Best claims she is a fraud pretending to be autistic for some reason or another, though i don't know if Amanda is a fraud or not.I must agree that publishing her address and using this as a back-handed threat to be violent towards her was wrong and I would delete a post like that if it were ever posted on my blog.Though I don't know if Baggs and her friend Laura are autistic I do know that hate begets hate and that might be a factor in people's response to Amanda. On Autistics.org, the website of her friend Laura and herself is a nasty abortion type cartoon showing an aborted autistic fetus with CAN written on a trashcan in which the fetus is being deposited with the caption \"the real meaning of autism prevention\" For that reason, I was the second person to post a response to the blog thread Best started talking about their complaint to blogger about the threat. I must admit I do have some misgivings about my comment, because, as I said before, I don't think there was a justification for publishing Amanda's address and suggesting in any way someone commit a violent act upon her.John Best defends his bad behavior on his blog claiming that he knows that autism can be cured via chelation and that neurodiversity are engaging in lies and propaganda so that people will not know their children can be cured. However, another explaination for Mr. Best's behavior which has been given by some of his detractors is that his behavior indicates that he himself is somewhere on the autism spectrum, this is the reason for his obsessions and perservations and his cybertantrums.Neurodiversity proponents for the most part seem to claim that autistics need acceptance and not a cure. Michelle Dawson in her essay the misbehavior of behaviorists even suggests that a sister wanting to cure her brother of his autism which causes her to be kept awake all night, causes him to scratch her and destroy her property is some sort of intolerant bigot for wishing this.One must wonder if John Best is truly on the spectrum are neurodiversity advocates intolerant bigots for insulting him on his own blog, complaining about his actions to blogger and villifying him on their own blogs. And in the case of autism diva, Joseph of the natural variation blog and possibly some of the other neurodiversity blog owners banning him outright from particpating in the comments section of their blogs.  Could it be that these preachers of acceptance rather than cure are not accepting John Best, assuming there is any possibility at all that Best himself is one of their own, even if possibly having a \"forme fruste\" of the condition or a shadow syndrome of autism?I really wonder how any follower of neurodiversity can reconcile this. They should either acknowledge at least the possibility that Best is somewhere on the spectrum and accept him, not insult him, allow him to post in their blogs or perhaps they should re-examine some of the cognitive dissonance of their own philosophy.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/06/acceptance-of-john-best-dilemma-for.html", "title": "\nacceptance of John Best: A dilemma for neurodiversity\n"},
{"date": " May 29, 2008", "body": "\nToday I was reading an article in the Los Angeles times on how Cesarean sections are on the rise due to ob/gyn doctors being fearful of lawsuits and sometimes doing them unnecessarily. This has lead to premature delivery of babies who might be vulnerable to autism or other types of developmental disabilies. Don't get me wrong. I still believe that most of the perceived increase in autism is due to changes in special education law which have allowed persons to qualify for services such as ABA. This is in addition to changes in diagnostic criteria and the increasing recognition that persons of normal intelligence can be autistic.However, no one really knows for sure if more persons with autism spectrum disorders are being born then were 15 or more years ago. As there is no real biologic marker to determine whether or not someone is autistic it is mostly just guesswork. I believe it could be possible that there is a slight increase in autistic children being born, though not the huge increases that SAFE MINDS and other vaccine causes autism groups claim. One of the theories is that at least some of the cause of autism is due to increased paternal age of fathers of autistic children. I know that some people who blog on the internet such as Harold Doherty and John Best had their autistic sons when in their 40s. Also, ironically enough Donald Trump who recently became a father at age 61 said that he was going to not have his offspring receive a multitude of vaccinations at once to minimize the chances of the baby becoming autistic.It seems to me that premature birth is one of the factors that could cause a person to become autistic. Another irony is that Sally Bernard, one of the leaders of the vaccines causes autism movement had an autistic son who was a triplet, born prematurely. It is much more likely this is what caused her son's autism than mercury in vaccines. It seems that there might be a temporal relationship between cesarean sections and the rate of autism increases. Of course with my problems that won't be easy to research and I don't know if I am going to pursue that avenue. I have shown, I believe, there is no temporal relationship between autism and vaccines in my article \"Autism and Thimerosal is there really a correlation?\" http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/thimerosal.html  However, there is still a temporal relationship between changes in special education law and the commercialization of ABA treatments with their pie-in-the-sky claims of normalcy for nearly 50% of autistic children who undergo the 40 hour per week paradigm starting before they are age 36 months. I suspect, as I said before that this is a factor.However, the incidence of Cesarean sections and how much they have increased and whether or not this is a factor in some autism deserves some exploration. It could be the basis for scientific research into the etiology of at least some autism also.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/thimerosal.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/05/could-cesarean-sections-be-partly.html", "title": "\ncould Cesarean sections be partly responsible for autism increse\n"},
{"date": " June 9, 2008", "body": "\nAmongst some of my non-published writings, there is a 9,000 word essay that I wrote entitled Questionmark etiology: Ground Zero. This essay details the frustration I have had my entire life of wanting to know what caused my problems, more specifically my autism. I use the word \"problems\" rather than autism because this quest goes back to when I was 6 years old or younger before I had even heard of the term autism, let alone thinking i might have it or being diagnosed with it or being told of said diagnosis. This is not to be confused with a short fiction piece I wrote entitled \"question mark etiology\" at http://jonathans-stories.com/stories/qmark.html which deals with carpal tunnel syndrome and masturbation, two rather fascinating subjects in their own right (very big grin). This essay also deals with some of my experiences as the research subject of autism neuroscientist Eric Courchesne in some of his MRI studies. I have written a piece also which is on my web page, http://jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/corc.html which details some of those experiences also.I thought it might be interesting to summarize some of the points I wrote about in that essay which I wrote as a chapter of a non-fiction book I wrote a rough draft of. The Book's title is \"Crying for Toasted Snow\" because this is what I feel that parents of autistic children who expect their children to become typical kids through ABA, chelation and other treatments do. Complaining about things they cannot have.   I believe this is also true of those in the neurodiversity movement who have the pipe dream of complete societal acceptance of everything involving autism and this solving everything, enabling autistics to function in the same manner as NTs.  It comes from what is supposedly an old arab proverb, the discontended child cries for toasted snow. Also my essay on Bill Gates, Albert Einstein and Thomas Jefferson, http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/undiagnosing.html is one of the chapters of this book. In my essay, I write about how the fact I had \"problems\" was drilled into from age 5 and younger.  I was seeing a psychoanalyst at the time.  Psychoanalysis was the early intervention of choice for people with problems like mine in the late 1950s when I was 3 years old.  My psychoanalyst had a rather interesting theory about the etiology of my problems.  Since I had a sister who was 3 years younger than myself, she reasoned, at some point I must have seen her naked.  I noticed that she was missing something that I had- a penis.  She stated that I thought that my parents had cut off my sister's penis.  Therefore I was worried that mine would be cut off as well and this was one of the reasons for losing my speech before I was 3 years old and my feces smearing and self-stimulatory and other autistic behaviors.  This is referred to as castration anxiety in psychoanalysis.  There is also its corollary, penis envy in women who end up on the analyst's couch. Some years later, I was given a variety of psychologic tests including the Wechsler IQ test and the Bender-Gestalt test of visual motor perception.  I had abnormal scores on these and this was indicative of some type of brain-damage. In the summer of 1969 I saw the movie, \"A change of habit\" which dealt with an autistic child.  This was the first time I had heard of the word \"autistic\"  I was nearly 14 years old.  The girl in the movie was 3 years old and had no speech, just I was told that I had no speech by both my parents and my psychoanalyst.  I recovered my speech probably before I was 5.  I asked my mother if this could be what I was autistic.  My mother told me she had inquired about this possibility with some people and they rejected this notion.  Not long after that another psychiatrist I was seeing as a teenager, after I stopped seeing my psychoanalyst, decided along with my parents that I had autism.  But did labels like autism and brain damage tell me what specifically caused my problems, no.  What area of the brain was dysfunctional in my case?  What caused that dysfunction? In the late 1980's I read an article in the L.A. times that part of the autism puzzle may have been solved.  A researcher I had never heard of named Eric Courchesne had found in about 70% of autistics he had conducted MRI scans on had an area of the cerebellum that was smaller than in normal controls.  These were lobules VI and VII of a part of the cerebellum called the vermis.  I was absolutely intrigued.  I wanted to know if this could be what caused my problems, damage to this part of the cerebellum.  I contacted the Courchesne research lab.  They were happy to find an autistic with intact intelligence to be a research subject.  Nearly 20 years ago it was not thought there were anywhere near as many high functioning autistics of normal intelligence as there are today.  I had the scan and I was told that I had this abnormality also, or at least the sizes of my cerebellar vermis lobules VI and VII were of average size for an autistic.  The sizes of these lobules varied within the experimental group of autistics. I was pleased with this relevation, but still it was not enough.  I wanted to know more.  I had read some stuff about the brain and its functioning.  It seemed that it was very likely that autism was a problem involving the neurotransmitter norepinephrine.  Also, an area of the cerebellum called the superior cerebellar penducle on which synapses coming from the dorsal tegmental bundle came from occurred.  The dorsal tegmental bundle was one of the major brain tracts containing the neurotransmitter norepinephrine.  I had read about the work of brain researcher James Olds who found that electrical brain stimulation of certain parts of the brain were reinforcing and some of these brain areas were referred to as \"pleasure centers\".  I wondered if my self-stimulatory behaviors were due to something like this.  Research on rats had shown that stimulation of the superior cerebellar peduncle was reinforcing.  When the dorsal tegmental bundle was severed the rats continued to find stimluation to the superior cerebellar peduncle reinforcing.  Could it be that norepinephrine was an inhibotory neurotransmitter and suppressed the urges of the superior cerebellar peduncle?  This could be part of my problems.  The few post-mortem autopsies of autistic brains showed lowered purkinje cell counts in the cerebellums of autistic persons.  Norepinephrine and GABA are the only two neurotransmitters used by these neurons.  This would increase evidence of norepinephrine involvement in the etiology of autism.  I wondered could this be something worth looking into as an etiologic factor of autism and could MRI measurements of the superior cerebellar peduncles be taken in autistic subjects.  I asked Dr. Courchesne about this.  He said that it was an interesting theory.  He stated that the cerebellar peduncles were only a few millimeters and too small to make measurements of in comparison to normal controls.  I still think this is a hypothesis that might be worth pursuing and might be the cause of at least some autism.  More scientific research might enlighten us. Some years after I had my scan with the Courchesne lab.  I was reading an article by researcher Joseph Piven that he believed Courchesne did not adequately control for age and sex differences between the autistic subjects and the control MRI scans.  Due to budgetary limitations, the study that Courchesne published in the New England Journal of Medicine used hospital inpatients as controls.  It would be too costly to find controls of comparable age and sex and perform MRI scans on them.  Because the measurement techqniques were experimental there were no standard sizes of a cerebellar vermis for an adult man, adult woman, 12 year old boy, 10 year old girl, etc.  It was quite possible that the smaller measurements in the autistics could have been an artifact of their being younger than the adult controls who might naturally have larger cerebellar vermi.  This was a real disappointment.  Of course I was an adult at the time, so maybe my having a smaller part of the cerebellar vermis could still mean something in terms of the etiology of my problems. I am not sure, but i don't think that Courchesne's work has ever been replicated.  My friend neuroscientist Matthew Belmonte, a former graduate student and protege of Eric Courchesne disagreed.  He said there were several studies that replicated Courchesne's findings.  He cited some examples.  Most of these I have not read.  One of the examples he cited though was of a Japanese neuroscientist named Hashimoto who published a study in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders.  I read the Hashimoto study and from my understanding of it, it would contradict what Matthew said.  Hashimoto seemed to have measured the entire cerebellar vermis stating that it was abnormally small in autistic subjects.  However, Courchesne's work had concentrated on just lobules VI and VII.  There were ten lobules and only two of those ten were abnormally small in the autistic subjects.  In one subject there was a smaller lobule VIII, though this was the only exception.  So I don't think Hashimoto replicated Courchesne's work.  I guess I will have to become more well read in the autism literature before I can make more determinations. The final point is that my pursuits in finding out the exact etiology of my problems has been a tremendous disappoint.  At age 52 I don't really understand anymore than I did at age 6. I don't remember ever seeing my sister naked.  Of course for castration anxiety to be the cause of my problems I would have had to see her naked right after the time she had been delivered and was taken home from the hospital.  But so far, since I don't know what brain physiology mechanisms are involved, I can't help but wondering if maybe castration anxiety could actually be at the root of my problems, but I guess I will never know.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://jonathans-stories.com/stories/qmark.html", "http://jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/corc.html", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/undiagnosing.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/06/questionmark-etiology-ground-zero.html", "title": "\nQuestionmark Etiology: Ground Zero\n"},
{"date": " June 11, 2008", "body": "\nWell my friends at the age of autism website, with their quick fix solutions of vaccines being the etiology of autism and research in this area being the salvation for persons with autism are at it again.In one of their latest posts they laud actor Charlie Sheen who is trying to stop his ex-wife actress Denise Richards from vaccinating their daughters because of the evidence that vaccines cause autism. Sheen has stated he will sue if necessary to stop his ex-wife. The post goes on to further state that Charlie Sheen has done his homework in looking at the safety issues of the vaccination schedules. But has Mr. Sheen really done his homework or is this just another example of the mercury militia exploiting a poorly informed celebrity to further their misguided agenda.The age at which parents notice autism and the vaccines in question that would have caused autism are given before the age of 36 months. Their daughters are 4 and 3 years old. It is likely that if they were to get autism from a vaccination they would have gotten it by that age. It seems implausible that vaccinations given at this age would cause them to become autistic when given when they were 3 and 4 years old. Certainly his kids getting a DPT booster shot, which is given routinely at the age of 5, would not be an issue in their getting autism from a vaccine.The UK has had autism prevelance increases that are similar to those in the United States. Yet there has only been one thimerosal containing vaccine, DPT, that was used there. The only change made in the UK was earlier administration of the three vaccines. I don't remember the exact age when the three vaccines were given in the UK pre-change and post-change but I do know in both cases all three vaccines were given before the age of one. This would mean that even if what the mercury militia says is true, vaccines given after the age of 1 are inconsequential for getting autism. The celebrity couple's children are substantially older than that, so there is no way that those two children could get autism from vaccines.It is interesting to note that in my correspondence with Mark Geier, this supposed vaccine expert made a similar sort of error to Charlie Sheen. When I asked Dr. Geier how he explained the doubling of autism prevalence by birth years in the states regional center from 1970 to 1986 from 4/10,000 to 8/10,000 and then the increase from 12/10,000 in 1991 at a time when there was only one thimerosal containing vaccine he stated that uptake of DPT increased from 50% to 90% between 1970 and 1986 and that the number of shots increased from 3 to 5. It was never 3 shots before the age of 1. Geier provided no documentation for the increase in uptake. However, he does not explain why if there were such a huge increase in uptake why there was not along with the increase in autism there was not a corresponding decrease in pertussis which would have to have been of a much greater magnitude than the autism increase. Health records from various state agencies contradict this notion and show pertussis if anything was slightly on the rise during this time. Also the three to five shots argument is irrelevant because it would only be the three shots given before the age of one which would be relevant. The fifth shot is a booster shot given at age 5 which would be obviously inconsequential in causing autism. As far as I know this supposed vaccination expert who gives out such implausible facts is the only person to publish a study showing an association between thimerosal containing vaccines and autism, the rest of the literature refutes the association.From reading the age of autism website and reading the link they gave to the TMZ entertainment news about the actors conflicts over their children, it would appear that at least one of shots Mr. Sheen is trying to prevent his daughters from getting is the DPT booster shot given at age 5 which would prevent their daughters from getting whooping cough. There are probably other shots as well he is trying to deny his children that could result in otherwise preventable childhood diseases and illnesses for his offspring.It is sad enough that this poorly informed celebrity would endanger the welfare of his own daughters in such a manner. It is much worse that those who publish the age of autism website would exploit this tragedy in such a callous manner when it is clearly they and Mr. Sheen who are not doing their homework.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/06/more-absurd-nonsense-from-age-of-autism.html", "title": "\nMore absurd nonsense from age of autism website\n"},
{"date": " June 17, 2008", "body": "\nJoseph of the natural variation blog posed an interesting question to me in my previous post about autistic subway afficianado Darius McCollum. Is the reason the New York transit won't give the man a job due to incompetence or societal prejudice. I explained in my response, which interested readers can read in the comments section of my previous entry, that I believed it was neither.Joseph's question, however, gave me an incredible inspiration. The Autistic self-advocacy Network and other neurodiversity leaning organizations are always claiming to be promoting a better life for autistic people. How they did this by putting so much energy in the ransom notes campaign is beyond me. I really don't understand what the ransom notes campaign accomplished. It does not seem to me to have benefitted any person with autism in any way, found them a girlfriend or job or made them function better or made their life better in any way. It did nothing to ameliorate bullying of autistic children or give autistics a better image.What about them engaging in a more constructive activity? The one I have in mind is providing either some sort of legal defense fund for McCollum or finding a lawyer who could do probono work for McCollum in what will soon be his umpteenth criminal trial. Then, assuming an acquital or suspended sentence could be obtained, ASAN and other organizations could convince the New York Metro Authority to give Darius a job and show somehow that this man would be a dedicated worker and the City of New York would not have to worry about liability.Is this notion farfetched? After all, if memory serves me correctly Kathleen Seidel found an attorney on a pro bono basis to help her quash the subpoena directed against her (I guess any commenter can correct me if I am wrong about this) An attorney could be found for McCollum also. In one of the articles I read about him his parents were deeply in debt because of all the legal costs his train obsession had incured. Joseph could also do a statistical analysis, which he seems apt at, to show a mathematical model of why the city of New York would not have to worry about liability if McCollum were in their employ. They could engage in the same type of flier campaigns, phone calls, petitions and complaints that occurred during the ransom note campaign. If they would try to advocate on McCollum's behalf, let alone successfully enabling him to land a job rather than return to sing sing the neurodiversity people would earn some respect from me.I wonder what the probability of them advocating for McCollum is? I suspect they won't do it. Perhaps ASAN and other organizations care less about helping people then they do about their bruised egos. Their feelings are hurt because some people by implying autism needs a cure are saying they are less than perfect people. McCollum presents them with such an incredible opportunity though. It is much easier to engage in a smear campaign against the ransom notes, easier to bash and insult parents who may be misguided but have the best of intentions for their kids. Easier to insult organizations like Autism Speaks and claim they commit genocide, yet flock to Michelle Dawson's comment board and blog like flies to honey in spite of the fact that people in the lab she works in get funding from autism speaks and her boss Laurent Mottron participates in meetings with researchers that autism speaks sponsors and apparently tries to get funding from this organization that neurodiversity hates so much (I know because i met Dr. Mottron at one of those meetings).To be blunt I think organizations like ASAN and other neurodiversity proponents should put their money (figurative or literal) where their mouths are. Some of them point to the huge success of gay people in advocating for themselves, yet ignore the fact that the gay community is well financed and most persons with autism (a fact these neurodiversity people won't acknowledge) have very little money to offer to a cause. Yet they still believe they can change society to have a more accepting attitude of autistics and they can achieve the same kind of civil rights status.Well, ASAN members, GRASP members, wrong planet afficianados, ANI members and aspies for freedom and other neurodiversity groups, here's your chance. One of your own fellow aspies needs help. He needs it badly.

McCollum is a man who is alleged to have Asperger's symptom and is absolutely obsessed by trains, in particular the New York City transit system.  This is not the first time McCollum has been arrested.  He has comitted this same crime before multiple times and has even spent time in prison.  As a boy, McCollum grew up near one of the subway stations and would hang out there all the time and became friendly with a lot of the city's transit workers. They showed him the ropes and he managed to learn more about the New York subways than any person alive. He apparently could not get a job working for the New York transit system.  This was in spite of his intense desire to work there and considerable expertise.  Instead he chose to impersonate an employee instead doing the job as well as a real worker could until he was discovered and busted. Temple Grandin in one of her many simplistic notions about autism states that the OCD symptomatology of autistics is not a liability but is rather a gift. She states that problems autistics have with making a living can be easily solved. They can channel their obsessions into productive activities and be gainfully employed. The only real example that she gives is of herself and the fact that her obsession with livestock, cattle shoots and squeeze machines helped her to land her lucrative career as a slaughterhouse designer. She lauds her own success in her various books. In Emergence Labeled autistic she states that she shows that the behaviors of autism can be modified and controlled and that autistics can be a success. Many persons with autism no longer need to cry their tears of toasted snow because they are unable to make a living. In one article she wrote, she talks about a man who is obsessed with sliding doors and claims that this obsession could be channeled into helping this man with autism have a career in electronics.  She claims that an autistic man who would commit a faux pas by asking women, \"where are your earrings\" due to an obsession with jewelry could have this obsession channeled into a career as a jeweler.She gives an example of an autistic Ph.D. level mathematician who had not worked for years, because there were noise sensitivity issues that prevented him from being a math professor.  She states a research job would have been more appropriate.  If the research job is more appropriate then why couldn't he have gotten it?  Could it be that Grandin's ideas are just simplistic solutions for those who cry tears of toasted snow?  The prospective electronics specialist and jeweler are also conjecture on her part.  There is no evidence that obsessions can be successfully turned into careers so that a person with autism would never have to worry about being on the dole again. Darius McCollum is an example of someone whose obsession was not turned into a successful career.  According to Grandin's logic his obsession with trains, subways and the NYC transit system should have easily landed him a job.  This is particularly true in light of the fact that unlike the examples that Grandin gives in her conjecture of what could be turned into a career McCollum actually does have considerable expertise in the New York subway system.  His Asperger's however did not help a career in this field to pan out. News of McCollum's most recent arrest will not spark this issue to the forefront.  People will continue to cry their tears of toasted snow, thinking there are easy quick fix solutions to the problems of autistics that so many persons propose.  I believe the sad saga of Darius McCollum is  an example to show that at least one of these quick fix solutions is in fact bogus.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/06/darius-mccollum-busted-again.html", "title": "\nDarius McCollum busted again\n"},
{"date": " June 23, 2008", "body": "\nAs some people in the neurodiversity movement know, an individual named Zach is alleging that autism speaks contacted an internet service provider zazzle.com saying they would no longer allow him to post ads selling the t-shirts on their web site.  I posted something about this previously, in my last post about Amanda Baggs' grossly inconsistent behavior in crying \"censorship\" on zazzle's part when she herself advocates censorship of any comment that does not agree with what she believes in on ANI's mailing lists on some of autistic.org's lists, etc.Afterwards, I was wondering, could this story be real.  Autism speaks was being vilified by all of these neurodiversity afficianados without being allowed to tell their side of the story.  They were calling autistic speaks \"bullies\".  The veracity of the story seemed far fetched to me as it would not seem worth the while of autism speaks to actually try to engage in this type of behavior and considering all the bashing they get on the internet all of the time if they would really contact zazzle and give some sort of directive that zach's ads be pulled.  Zach claimed to have proof of this but as far as I could tell this \"proof\" only consisted of a letter he alleges Zazzle wrote him saying that they were contacted by autism speaks.   Clearly this guy has an ax to grind against autism speaks it certainly seemed conceivable he could be fabricating the whole thing.  Another explanation is that someone at Zazzle had an autistic child who they wanted a cure for their child and was offended by these t-shirts was just trying to get zach's goat and claimed that the directive came from autism speaks when it really did not.  Of course I realized it was possible that Zach might be telling the truth, though I had no way of verifying this as no one from autism speaks wanted to come forward and post their side of the story on the internet.I decided that in all fairness that I should contact autism speaks and find out what their version of the event was.  I talked to a woman in their communications department named Dana Marnay.  She stated that Zazzle felt that Zach was violating their terms of service policy for some reason and that autism speaks had nothing to do with this THEY IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM CONTACTED ZAZZLE PERIOD!  The decision to pull zach's t-shirt ads they said was entirely Zazzle's autism speaks had nothing to do with it whatsoever. I don't know whether Zach is lying about this or not and I don't know if the letter zazzle sent to him was a fabrication or not.  Assuming this letter is not an out and out fabrication on Zach's part, then maybe the representative of zazzle was lying when he told this young man that they were contacted by autism speaks. I know that I am not lying.  Those skeptics can call Dana Marnay at autism speaks at (212) 252-8584 and ask her themselves. Clearly Wrong Planet, autism bitch from hell, Ballasexistenz (AKA Amanda Baggs) just wanted to assume that this story of Zach's is true. If Zach or anyone else from the neurodiversity movement has proof that I am making this up or the communications lady at Autism Speaks is lying when she told me that autism speaks never ever contacted Zazzle, I say bring it on!!  Seems that now if Autism speaks really wanted to stifle the speech of the autistics who don't like them, they would very possibly have a legal basis for suing Zach for libel, I am pretty sure they won't do this.  If this story is also true, then Amanda should have no objection to Zazzle not allowing content on their sites that they don't deem fit just as Amanda feels she has that right. In the meantime for those old enough to remember the TV show from my youth To Tell The Truth that was on TV during the stone age:  Would the real bully please stand up!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/06/zach-t-shirt-saga-autism-speaks-side-of.html", "title": "\nThe Zach T-shirt saga: Autism speaks' side of the story\n"},

{"date": " June 21, 2008", "body": "\nWell that well known neurodiversity activist amanda Baggs is at it again.You can check out her latest blog entry: http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=542In this blog entry Amanda is criticizing autism speaks because they seem to want to protect their copyright infringement rights from those in the neurodiversity community who want to parody them.  Somehow Amanda and others find this objectionable and claim that this is because Autism speaks wants to stifle points of view of autism self-advocates who disagree with them. One thing I read that interested me was that Larry Arnold had acquired a domain name with autism speaks in it.  Larry, another well known neurodiversity who I understand takes umbrage of controls in autism studies who don't have autism being described as healthy.  He seems to think someone with autism is not unhealthy.  Why this is so baffles me.  He also claims that this site will be used for self-advocacy and not NT bashing.  Sometimes, though I wonder what the difference is.  From what I have seen of the neurodiversity movement it seems the vast majority of their activities is being abusive to parents who wish a cure for autistics and disagree with them, so I am not sure what the difference between the two is. More Germane and to the point is that Amanda may not be aware of the fact that autism speaks has a message board www.autismspeaks.org On this message board, they have a very loose comment moderation policy and only restrict people from using profane language.  NT parents are constantly bashed in this forum as is autismspeaks itself.  They don't seem to mind this.  Constantly neurodiversity advocates protest a non-existent cure that autismspeaks wishes to find.  The people who moderate the autism speaks message board don't seem to mind these activities by neurodiversity advocates at all. I think Amanda, who David Seidel has said in one of the posts does not read this message board, should be made aware of this.  I have sent Amanda an email explaining this.  She might find out about this blog entry also.  One person who answered her comments is this young man (about 21 I think) named beau who has autism and is a neurodiversity advocate who constantly writes anti-cure rhetoric and other negative things on this board, yet posts on Amanda's comments that Autism speaks stifles opinions from autistics who don't agree with them.  Seems very strange that he would say something like this since i dont think any of beau's posts have been censored on the autismspeaks board. Amanda on the other hand, has been very active in ANI, a neurodiversity organization which promoted internet censorship and would not allow people to make any comment that disagreed with them on their internet mailing list.  I seem to remember autistics.org had some sort of similar thing and Amanda said it was not censorship and defined censorship as something else.  I also saw that autism hub organizer Steve Dionne was apparently deeply offended that someone would link to my essay, neurodiversity just say no to their signature line in the autism speaks newsgroups and urged them to take it out of their signature line.  Also several years ago when I was reading and posting on the usenet newsgroup alt.support.autism, one person wrote that this was \"autistic friendly space\" and the autistics on the board took offense to anyone saying autism was an affliction that needed to be cured.  I realize Amanda may not know about the people allowed to voice their anti-autismspeaks opinions on the autismspeaks.org message board as she may not read it herself as Dave Seidel pointed out.  .  I wonder what Amanda would think of this. It seems to me that at least one neurodiversity proponent is throwing stones in a house made of fragile glass.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=542", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/06/neurodiversity-advocates-who-live-in.html", "title": "\nneurodiversity advocates who live in glass houses department\n"},
{"date": " July 10, 2008", "body": "\nI am still at ASA 2008 in Orlando, Florida using the hotel's computer. I was saddened to find out tonight from Susan Moreno who publishes the MAAP newsletter that my email pen pal Marla Comm recently passed away from breast cancer. Here again is a review of her book that I wrote about 9 months ago published on Jonathan's Journal where I used to do my blogging before moving it to Autism's Gadfly:Well, recently I finished reading the book Severe Autism Support Denied by Leonard Jayson and my e-mail pen pal, Marla Comm. The book is about Marla's life as an autistic woman in Montreal Canada and all of the hardships that she has to endure because of her autism.The Theme of this book is in stark contrast to the more upbeat stories from people like Jenny McCarthy and Christina Adams and Catherine Maurice and others that I wrote about in my previous journal entry. It shows the negative side of autism, even in those who are college educated and by many standards high functioning.Marla lives in Montreal Canada, got a bachelors degree in Math and has a small part-time job as a library assistant. She is too impaired to take care of household chores and other matters and needs support in these areas which she cannot get. Montreal is a very bad environment for her due to the cold weather and the political situation there. Marla is English speaking and because of her disability was unable to learn French. The French who dominate Montreal are trying to suceed from Canada and do not like the English, especially those who speak no French. This is sort of like living in a foreign country and makes Marla isolated and her life difficult. I read about Marla in the MAAP newsletter and started corresponding with her some years ago and we have continued this correspondence via email. Marla has very little money and sometimes has to eat junk food to survive. She also suffers from some of the motor coordination problems that I suffer from so I was very interested to read about that. Marla suffers from severe global burnout after years of struggling in the unsuitable setting of Montreal without any supports.The book has some technical deficiencies as Jayson is not a professional author butsomeone who penpalled with Marla as did I and some other people. Marla is not a professional author either and suffers from ADHD as a condition co-morbid with her autism and therefore has organizational problems. Because of this when Jayson asked her to proof his writing for organizational problems Marla said she could not find any. There are numerous repetitions in the book and the way some of the information is presented is disorganized. In spite of this I enjoyed reading this as the negative side of autism hits home with me.Unfortunately, this is the type of book, along with David Miedzianik's stuff and the more negative things that I wrote will not go very far and will be censored by the powers that be. Marla's story is a story that needs to be told. However, people really want to hear success stories and hear that their kids will grow up to be another temple grandin or stephen shore. Not a David Miedzianik, Marla Comm or Jonathan Mitchell.If you happen to read this journal entry and you are interested in reading some of the negativities and hardships that a person with autism has to endure, I recommend you order the book from amazon.She was among the few high functioning internet autistics who had the good sense to realize what a horrible disability autism is.   I first started corresponding with Marla by snail mail several years ago after first reading about her in the MAAP newsletter, then we exchanged e-mail.  She will be missed greatly.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/07/in-memorium-marla-comm-1956-2008.html", "title": "\nIn Memorium: Marla Comm 1956-2008\n"},
{"date": " June 30, 2008", "body": "\nIt seems that nowadays the chic activity among autism afficianados regardless of their stripes is bashing autism speaks, the microsoft of autism research funding. It does not matter where you lie on the autism political spectrum. If you're a member of the mercury militia you don't like them because they are not devoting enough funding to your pet projects or you feel that they are too dumb to realize autism is not really a genetic condition but rather a man made plague, probably by mercury, but in some cases of people who believe in an environmentally mediated increase in autism prevalence possibly something else. If you are someone who believes in the neurodiversity philosophy you don't like autism speaks because you believe that if they succeed in curing autism the person will be changed and they won't be the same person anymore, they will have a different brain. Or, like the mercury militia, you don't like genetic research, but your reasons are that you believe it will lead to a prenatal test where autistic fetuses will be aborted. Another reason you are unhappy is because they have no autistics who serve on any of the boards or have any position of power in the organization.But why should I miss out on all the fun, even if due to my beliefs I am totally on the fringe since I have a unique view that does not agree with either camp. Actually I prefer to think I am a metaphorical island where I am one of the few persons interested in autism who is not on the fringe, but that is neither here nor there as my buddy Joseph would say.I am like the high school kid who wants to join the in crowd or some enviable social clique. I want to join in the fun too, so here it is, surprise surprise to my readers who see I sometimes defend autism speaks because I like the idea of scientific research with the goal of curing or preventing autism. I am now going to come clean, I have some real problems with autism speaks, so I am going to join you in bashing them.It all goes back to the days of AS's predecessor, CAN, before they were gobbled up by autism speaks in the corporate merger common to both for profit businesses and charitable organizations. In the days of CAN and before I retired when I was employed and had more money to throw around, I used to donate money to CAN, $100 here and there. Also, I donated $100 to CAN's eastcoast counterpart NAAR, another organization that existed before AS existed and was also gobbled up by autism speaks. I have yet to donate money to AS and even if I had it I would not donate a dime to them. But getting back to the topic at hand. I discovered that CAN was not the organization that I envisioned. Sally Bernard, one of the mercury militia's leaders, used her considerable wealth to influence CAN and get them to elect her president of the organization. Then CAN started to fund studies that investigated the possibility that thimerosal caused autism. I knew that thimerosal had nothing to do with autism for reasons I have detailed in an essay that I wrote, http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/thimerosal.html where I showed there was a tripling in autism prevelance in the california DDS during a time when the thimerosal an infant received in vaccines was stable. So I was rather appalled that they would appoint Bernard to a position of huge power in their organization and would fund thimerosal. CAN also had bylaws in writing stating that they would only fund medical research. They then violated their own bylaws by funding some work Ivar Lovaas was doing. This is in spite of the fact that Lovaas has not published any adult outcomes from his 1987 study in spite of receiving funding from NIMH to do so. I stopped donating money to CAN after that.Not much later, CAN became extinct after they and NAAR were gobbled up by autism speaks. I hoped the direction that autism speaks would take would be different from CAN, I hoped they would not make some of the same boneheaded mistakes that CAN made, but they did not fail to disappoint me.Recently I found out that Luc Keita, a post-doctoral fellow that works in Dr. Laurent Mottron's lab receives funding from an autism speaks grant. Dr. Mottron also has a somewhat cozy relationship with autism speaks and attends their conferences, I know because I met him at one. Dr. Mottron also employs that well known activist in the anti-curebie movement Michelle Dawson. Michelle implies in one of her essays that anyone who would want a cure for a severely autistic boy who scratches his sister, damages the families property and keeps them all awake howling at night is somehow an intolerant bigot. Because I want to cure autism and wrote an essay detailing my suffering from autism she states that I want to deny autistic people, of which I am one, their civil rights. In spite of the fact that autism speaks plainly states they want a cure and prevention for autism, Dawson calls them a credible fund raising organization. Either she is a hypocrite or she believes that autistic people are write-offs who should have no rights whatsoever in spite of her rhetoric. What autism speaks does by funding the Mottron lab is in my opinion the equivalent to promoting a private in the army who makes propaganda broadcasts for the enemy during wartime to rank of general rather than court martialing him and prosecuting him for treason. If anyone feels that statement is inflammatory, so be it. Ms. Dawson seems to tell me that other scientists she has worked with have grants from AS. She encourages other scientists to get grants from AS regardless of whether or not they agree with the pro cure philosophy of AS. Dawson argues that science and politics are not intertwined. I disagree. In the case of autism speaks politics clearly begot scientific funding. Bob and Suzanne Wright worked hard to start this organization so their grandson would have an improbable shot of living a better life and not end up being crippled by autism for the rest of his life. The AS walks, the donations, etc. were all most likely begotten by people desiring a cure for autism, many, whom I suspect never heard of the ND movement and would probably be shocked that something like it could conceivably exist. Dawson's statements remind me of the 32-year-old trophy wife who marries the 67 year old billionaire and states that money and lust are not intertwined.Probably even more bizarre I found out that autism speaks includes on its advisory committees Morton Gernsbacher. A psychology professor in Wisconsin who has an autistic child and does research in autism and wrote an essay entitled autistics need acceptance not cure. Ironically enough she was on some review committees for CAN when it existed also. I am mystified by why Dr. Gernsbacher who believes that autism should be accepted rather than cured would serve on scientific advisory boards of organizations whose philosophies I would think would be anathema to her own. But the more important question is why would autism speaks have a relationship with someone like that. After all, we don't hire John Dillinger and Al Capone to be police officers or FBI agents. So yes, autism speaks is not a terribly bright organization given the fact they would have an affiliation with such people who undermine the efforts and desires of those of us who view autism as a horrific affliction and wish that it could be cured and prevented (not abortions of autistic fetuses but prevented by altering the genetic mutation so the child won't have to grow up as a cripple).Also, I agree with my pals in the neurodiversity movement. Autism Speaks should have autistic people on their boards or in positions of power, this is another reason I am not terribly fond of them. If a pro-cure autistic such as myself were on the board, they would not make the slip shod decisions of the NTs that run AS do that would actually fund a lab that employs michelle dawson, someone who gives aide and comfort to our enemy, autism The pro-cure autistics would have the intelligence not to allow an anti-cure person like Morton Gernsbacher to sit on their advisory committees. That is why they should not only put me on the board but allow me to run the whole show there. Anti-cure people would not be allowed to be involved with autism speaks, their funding would be discontinued as would the funding of any lab such as the Mottron lab who would employ such a person. anti-cure people would not be allowed to sit on scientific and advisory committees on an organization that has plainly said their main purpose is to seek a cure for autism. It would seem that these would be common sense decisions but apparently all common sense has been thrown out the window as far as the people who run AS are concerned.But I don't think the neurodiversity affcianados would be happy with pro-cure autistics serving on the board. They would just call us token autistics or house autistics or say we were on the take. There are some who would say, that the majority of autistics don't want to be cured so we are not truly representative. To the neurodiversity people I have this to say, autism speaks is a pro-cure organization, the people who started it, acquired charitable donations, who donated their money to this organization walked the 5 kilometers for autism etc. all likely want a cure. They don't agree with you. So why should they allow you to serve on the board of autism speaks? If you want, start your own charitable organization and raise money to help your own cause. Don't expect to be a trophy wife who marries a much older man out of convenience because there is ready made capital to be had. Do your own work. Or is it that your movement is really so impotent, that you really have no alternative to latching onto autism speaks and try to use their money to promote your misguided agenda?Zach Lassiter who has gained some celebrity through the t-shirt controversy absolutely had the right idea. I agree with his message that autism speaks does not speak for him and many other persons on the spectrum. These people have asperger's and not autism. They are speaking for people much more severely afflicted than you, so if autism speaks should go away, you should go away too. Go away neurodiversity asperger's people, you don't speak for me and you don't speak for autism speaks and there is no reason why you should. Zach if you happen to read this, thank you very much for your message that you printed on your t-shirt. If you want to make some money, Zach, maybe you could make another t-shirt and sell it to some pro cure people, particularly those involved with autism speaks and have the message on it:\"You don't speak for autism speaks, autism speaks speaks for itself, go away neurodiversity.\"In the same vein, Sally Bernard and her minions don't need to serve on the boards of autism speaks or CAN. Sally and Tom's net worth is 15 times larger than autism speaks' assets if I am not mistaken. Clearly they can afford to start their own organization, they already have with SAFE MINDS. They can acquire all the capital they need to pursue their misguided agenda.Well that is my bash of autism speaks and my take on things, I am glad I did not get left out of the party and I hope that all of those people who thought I was the only person left on the planet who liked autism speaks are happy.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/thimerosal.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/06/bashing-autism-speaks-my-turn.html", "title": "\nBashing Autism Speaks: My Turn\n"},

{"date": " July 13, 2008", "body": "\nI just got back from the national conference of the autism society of America last night.  It was in Orlando, Florida.  I had a pretty good time, got reacquainted with lots of old friends I had not seen in a while. It first started out with my sitting next to a woman named Enid on the plane.  She is an employee of Johnson Mayer who was doing a presentation for them on software for autistic children.  We struck up a conversation and I was interested to find out that she lived in Colorado at one time and worked with Bill Bernard, the son of the renowned Mercury Mom Sallie Bernard.I got to the conference and met my friend Stephen Shore, the autism conference phenomenon.  I also met my friend Adam who was there, whom I had not seen since we first met in person in Nashville, Tn at the ASA conference there in 2005.  He was 20 when we first met, now he is a more mature 23 and he did look a bit older and seemed to be able to talk better with more emotional maturity then when I remembered him.  He boasted about some sort of social pragmatics program that his speech therapist was doing with him which he seems to believed helped him.  Though I am nearly his dad's age, we chat on AOL all the time and sometimes on the phone and I feel that I know Adam very well in spite of the fact that I have only seen him in person a couple of times.  He lives in Miami so he was just a couple of hundred miles away from the conference.  I always bug him about certain girls and persuade him to try to get a job working at this local supermarket chain in Florida.  I have a sort of uncontrollable compulsion to talk about these same topics with him over and over again due to my autism.  He does not seem to mind too much and that makes me happy I can have a friend with whom I can do this and get away with this.  Very few neurotypical people would tolerate such behavior from me.  I also renewed my acquaintance with Cheri Cary, the president of ASA's San Diego chapter.  She has a severely autistic son who is age 10 and does not speak but uses an adaptive communicator.  I have never met her son.  This is always a problem with going to these conferences.  The autistics I meet are usually high functioning and I don't get to meet a very good sample of persons on the spectrum.  Unfortunately and ironically, the more severely autistic people are left at home with caretakers and are considered too handicapped to attend the conference.I also saw my friend Gail Fitzpatrick and her kids Bridget and Jan Rankowski.  Bridget is a tall attractive 19-year-old redhead, very friendly to everyone.  Jan gained a certain amount of notoriety a few years back because he was excluded from playing on a public playground some years ago due to behavior issues caused by Asperger's and his mother filed a lawsuit over it.  The lawsuit got national media coverage.  The suit is now over and Ms. Fitzpatrick and her children are glad to be out of the limelight.  Jan is now 13 and has a rather pleasant sense of humor that I enjoyed.  Bridget feels that she is somewhere on the spectrum also.  Though I wish to cure autism, they are among the people on the spectrum that I enjoy as well as others.  So much for neurodiversity's stereotype of me and other pro cure people about hating autistic people just because we hate autism in some individuals.  I still remember laughing out loud when i read in the newspaper about Jan telling the school principal about how obese she had become recently.  I never dreamed that a couple years later, I would get to meet Jan and his family and get to know them somewhat. The first keynote speaker was Dr. Robert Hedron of the MIND institute.  He gave a talk about the schtick of there being an autism epidemic.  Seems everyone who works at the MIND has a certain political position about autism's true prevalence rising in spite of the limited evidence of this fact.  Hedron also stated the completely fallacious position of autism's prevalence being thought of as 1/10,000 as recently as 1993.  Only one study has shown this and it was Treffert's study which was published in 1970.  The MIND institute seems to want some sort of media recognition in the way they play with the numbers.  Dr. Hedron also talked about the ongoing CHARGE study which tries to correlate certain things about autism and genetics as well as other activities by the MIND institute.  Temple Grandin still had not arrived, though she would be the final keynote speaker, she would not be at the conference until the next day. After Dr. Hedron's talk I again saw Steve Edelson who runs the ARI institute in San Diego and is one of the board members as well.  He seems to be Bernie Rimland's heir apparent.  He was always nice to me, in spite of the fact that I have always expressed cynicism about what ARI does and about the DAN protocol in general.  He was talking to James Adams, another member of ARI (on the board of directors) and when I saw her nametag, I did a double take, Lynn Redwood.  I introduced myself to Ms. Redwood and gushed a bit, due to her celebrity as being the ying to Sally Bernard's yang in terms of the most well known mercury moms prior to the Jenny McCarthy days (I also met Ms. McCarthy at another conference I went to, where my friend Stephen Shore presented but that's another story altogether).  I exchanged pleasentries with Ms. Redwood and she told me her son is 14 now.  I told her that I was interested in meeting a celebrity like her because I had read about her in David Kirby's book, Evidence of Harm.  She laughed at that and told me that now people would call her up and ask her if she really drank the wine that Kirby had mentioned her drinking in the book.  She said she had a listed phone number.  I told her about my essay that I wrote showing that there was no correlation between thimerosal administration tripling of prevalence of autism in the state's regional centers between 1970 and 1991.  She just sort of shrugged it off, claiming that the autism epidemic was not as simple as just thimerosal and there were many environmental factors that played a role.  This seems indicative of the shift that the mercury militia seems to be engaging in now that the evidence against their hypothesis is so overwhelming. I talked to James Adams and he seemed a nice man, geniunely interested in helping his teenaged autistic daughter with the studies on chelation that he is engaging in.  It had been many years since I had studied chemistry in school and did not do very well in it anyhow.  So, i asked him about the relationship between mercury and zinc as a mineral that occurs in the human body.  He explained to me that zinc and mercury were similar in terms of the number of electrons in their outer shells and how they were close to each other in the periodic table.  Therefore mercury could replace zinc in the body and cause adverse effects.  Dr. Adams was also interested in other heavy metals as well and was polite to me though I expressed cynicism in what they were doing. I asked Redwood, Adams and Edelson if they had ever heard of autism diva and they all said that they had.  So I guess when the diva was blogging, she got quite a reputation with the most outspoken advocates of the heavy metals hypothesis (other metals in addition to mercury).  I wished I knew more about the work they were doing so I could give a better evaluation of it and maybe debate some fine points with them.  Then again maybe it is just as well I did not know enough of the facts to debate. There was then a seminar about how learning affects the brain but that seminar was filled to capacity and the presenters said they would just give it again the next day for anyone who wanted it and they asked for volunteers to leave the room which was filled way to capacity in violation of Florida state fire regulation laws. Another seminar I went to was given by Dr. Bryan Jepson of thoughtful house.  The place that has acquired a bad reputation among some people because of Andy Wakefield's involvement with it.  He talked about the alleged autism epidemic.  How certain yeasts and minerals were associated with autism and brain function associated with autism and various treatments that could help in his opinion.  One of the things that stuck out in my mind during the lecture was that he stated that there had been a variety of studies trying to determine whether or not prevalence in autistic adults was the same as the 1/150 number that was considered the rate among children and none of them had found that rate.  He claimed that this was evidence for a true rise in autism prevalence.  Except for the Baird study that took place in North Dakota I was not aware of any such studies that took place like the ones that Jepson was describing.  After the lecture I asked him what studies those were.  He admitted that he could not really think of any but that I could look on SAFEMINDS website and perhaps they would have some.  This reduced his credibility in my eyes. Another lecture was not as interesting, about autism and driving that was given by Stephen Shore, the Debaudt's, Dennis and Brad.  I did not stay for the whole lecture but sort of wandered off and roamed the halls in my autistic hyperactive fashion.  Though the social interaction at the conference was good, most of the topics of the lectures left something to be desired.  IMFAR might be a better conference for this sort of thing and I might go there for my next conference if I go to another out of town conference again. I hooked up with my friend Adam later, and we roamed the halls of the exhibits.  I met Laura Apel, my editor at Exceptional Parent magazine who published my article on autism genetics and whether or not my suffering is necessary for society.  I was pleased to meet her.  I also went to the autism speaks booth.  I told them there was some concern about autistics not serving on any of the boards or in any positions of power.  They told me there were some sort of comittees forming within autism speaks that would include some autistic people.  They also recommended that if I wanted to get involved further with autism speaks that I might contact their los angeles office and they gave me the phone number.  My friend, Adam, might also be interested in getting a job with them and they gave him the number of the Miami office, near where he lives.  Who knows, maybe he and I can do something about the chief complaint that comes from some people on the spectrum about Autism Speaks not involving autistic people.  Of course, as I have said before on a number of occasions, those people would probably not be happy about pro-cure autistics serving on the boards or in positions of power. Later that evening Adam and I attended a reception for Autism Asperger Publishing Company headed by Keith and Brenda Myles.  I met Brenda and told her that I was skeptical of her anectodal claims that autism in females had been underreported.  She claimed that she had a journal article coming out soon which would show empirical evidence of this.  She invited me to read the article and send her comments.  I will be interested in this, because, as far as I know, there is nothing in the peer reviewed literature that substantiates this claim made by some female neurodiversity adherents. At this event I also got to see Valerie Paradiz and her son, Eli Wapner again after a year hiatus.  Valerie has a book in print about her son called Elijah's cup.  I did not read this whole book but from what I know about it, I probably would not care much for it as it seems to glorify Autism Network International and the rest of the neurodiversity movement.  Valerie is now on the board of directors of ASA.  She is another successful person, a college professor in New York, who claims to have somehow discovered that she has autism after her son's diagnosis.  This sort of thing bothers me because I feel it trivializes the great difficulties I have had in my life because of this disability which I consider to be a great affliction.  So, if you include both Stephen Shore and Valerie as persons with autism, ASA has two spectrum members on their board of directors, so maybe this will make those people who complain about autism speaks happy.  I suspect that most of the problems the vast majority of autistics face day to day are really an abstraction for Valerie, both because of her and the fact her son is tremendously high functioning in spite of having Asperger's syndrome. The saddest part of the evening at Keith and Brenda's party was seeing Sue Moreno who publishes the MAAP newsletter and has published some of my writings.  She has also published the writings of another like minded autistic named Marla Comm, who, like me, and unlike the neurodiversity crowd, really hates her autism and is tremendouly unhappy.  Marla would send me email sporadically and we would exchange pleasant emails.  I had not heard from Marla for a while and inquired about her with Sue.  Sue then told me the very devastating news that Marla had passed away from having a very aggressive form of breast cancer, which had killed her very rapidly.  I wrote about my sadness due to Marla's untimely demise in my previous post. I put on a happy face at the party and tried to have a good time in spite of this tragic news.  After the party, Adam took me back home in his car.  Due to his autism, he had a rather hard time finding the Gaylord Palms, the hotel where I was staying as well as where the conference was being held.  Finally we managed to find it. The next day I went to one of the more interesting lectures which was given by Dr. Katherine Rice of the CDC as well as two of her colleagues whose names i don't remember.  She is the person who wrote the CDC report last year, reporting a prevalence find of 1/150 individuals with autism among 8 year old children in various metropolitan areas of the United States.  After the lecture I asked Dr. Rice about what Bryan Jepson had said the previous day, asking her if there were studies that could possibly locate autistic adults at the same rates as children.  Then the question of environmental factors leading to an increase in autism rates could be ruled out.  She said that other than the Baird study done in South Dakota, there were really no such studies and they would be hard to do, because most of the 8 year old children presented in special education schools and clinical settings where most adults would not present.  She said that she might be interested in trying to find a population like this if funding could be done.  I asked her about my own theories about a temporal relationship between changes in special education legislation and increases in autism prevalence.  She said that this was one thing to consider but one of the problems with this was that the autism rates would have plateued but they did not plateau after the special ed legislation was enacted.  Then I asked about various environmental considerations and whether or not the higher rate in New Jersey could be attributed to environment or perhaps New Jersey having a high level of services.  She repeated what I knew already from reading the article last year, that the speculation about whether people moved to New Jersey to obtain better services was not really the case as most of the autistic children that were surveyed in New Jersey had already been born there.  As far as anything else being the cause of New Jersey's high prevelance rate or whether there was something in the environment mediating these increases in autism she gave what seemed to me the usual scientific hedge and shrug of the shoulders.  She gave me her card with an email address and invited me to correspond with her. Later that day I happened upon Lee Grossman who was the president of the Autism Society of America and talked with him for a while.  I was still thinking about the question that Michelle Dawson posed to Autism Speaks about the 1.5 million autistic people in the United States and where that figure came from.  He said he had not heard of Michelle but what might interest Michelle is that he claimed that it was Autism Society of America who originally came up with the 1.5 million figure.  This figure was arrived at when the prevalence of autism was thought to be about 1/250 persons and based on what was thought to be the population of the U.S. at that time.  Grossman admitted to me that this was a rough estimate and was not thought to be indicative of what the true number was.  It was a number to be given to the CDC and other governmental organizations to debate and ponder.  Then the other organizations like unlocking autism and autism speaks just borrowed the figure that was originally made by the autism society of america.  That was interesting.  I doubt it will satisfy Michelle's non-moribund curiosity. Finally Saturday, the last day of the conference arrived, and what most of the attendees were awaiting with baited breath, Temple Grandin being the keynote speaker of the day. Grandin's lecture was delivered in her usual monotonic style and her strange sounding voice.  Some of the topics were new and interesting, others were just a rehash for those familiar with Grandin's writing.  She again, talked about Einstein and Gates being autistic.  She seemed to have changed her tune from stereotyping the majority of autistics to be visual thinkers as she is.  She gave different types of thinkers, visual, nonverbal and the category that yours truly would most likely fall into, very verbal but bad at motor activities, drawing and the like.  She also showed some slides of her scanned brain compared with a normal control.  i don't remember what the exact findings were but it was a study done by Nancy Minshew and some other persons whose names I don't remember.  She talked about her squeeze machine.  People on the spectrum needing to pursue interests and studies to find jobs and plan for careers.  She also talked about how manners were pored into people during her youth in the 1950s and how times had changed. She showed an interesting slide, showing the Lone Ranger and Tonto, entertainment icons from her youth with a slide of Brittany Spears to show how the behavior of media personalities had changed over the years.  Another interesting thing I remember about her lecture was her not infrequent use of the politically incorrect term 'normal' that just about everyone else has now seemed to have abandoned.   I got to meet Grandin and shake hands with her.  She was very unfriendly and perfunctory.  I don't know if it was due to the fact that she knew who i was and remembered our phone conversation that took place about 16 years ago and the fact she might have known that I have written some unfavorable things about her in some of my writings.  Also, American Normal, the book by Lawrence Osborne quotes me as saying some unfavorable things about her.  Some of the things I did say, but Osborne was not entirely accurate in what he quoted me saying.   She asked me about what I was doing now, and I had told her that I had worked sporadically as a medical transcriptionist for a number of years, but due to difficulties in the job and being fired a lot I had retired for the time being in my early 50s.  Grandin's response was predictable.  She said that medical transcription from what she had heard from at least a couple of other people with autism who had tried the job was not a good occupation for an autistic person.  So much for being able to contradict some of Grandin's stereotypes as I thought I had before I left the profession.  Steve Edelson interjected and told Temple that I had written an article entited Neurodiversity just say no and I told her that while I wished there could be a cure for autism that I realized she favored a middle ground.  She wanted a cure or at least to do something about low functioning autistics, those who are mute and who engage in tantrums and self-mutilatory behaviors but she wanted to leave high functioning autism alone.   She then spent a bunch of time talking to my friend Adam, who recently finished college.  He wanted some advice on how to best find a job and a suitable career and Grandin gave him some suggestions about getting in the back door of a place, like for example one job that Adam had applied for was an evidence collector in a forensics lab.  Grandin suggested that he try to get his foot in the door by asking if he could volunteer, even if he had to clean glasses or something like that.  She talked about Katzenberg who started out in the mailroom and then became a media mogul with Stephen Spielberg at dreamworks. It was a fun conference, with good social interaction with some fun people, so for that reason I had a good time.  Though due to expense and lack of interesting lectures I probably won't be returning next year when the conference is held in the Chicago area or the year after when it is held in Dallas.  If I can ever afford it I might try to go to an IMFAR conference for my next autism \"field trip\".  My friend Matthew Belmonte has thought it would be a good idea to have a panel of autistic people talking there with me on a panel.  Also, I know my old pal Michelle Dawson goes to that one.  I might run into her there.  Now that would be interesting.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/07/back-from-asa-2008-my-adventures-in.html", "title": "\nBack from ASA 2008: My Adventures in autism\n"},
{"date": " July 29, 2008", "body": "\nIn the 4th century B.C. Aristotle stated that education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity.In November, 1975 president Gerald Ford signed the Education for all handicapped children act which later was to become the Individuals with disabilities education act with great reluctance. He stated that in spite of the fact the law had good intentions it would never be able to promise what it delivered and was unrealistically raising the expectations of the groups affected.Neither man could have possibly realized how prescient they were.I was a special education student for many years. Though I had left special education several years before the education for all handicapped children act was enacted into law, I am still interested in many of the issues and consequences of this law.I recently reread an article that appeared in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders about six years ago by attorney Myra Mandlawitz about the legal system's impact on educational programming for autistic children. This article has a bunch of interesting stuff.In Vorhees, one new jersey township it was stated that 40 hours a week of intensive one on one instruction was an expensive norm but this and other parental requests were consented to in order to avoid litigation.  It was expected that this level of service for the autistic children would continue year after year regardless of whether or not the child was making progress in the treatment.  The motivation for continuing the treatments seemed to be avoidance of litigation by parents.    One of the earliest supreme court cases regarding special ed was the Rowley case which took place in the early 1980s. it was stated by the supreme court that an \"appropriate\" education did not mean \"best\". It did not mean that school districts could only offer a jalopy level of education but were under no obligation to offer a rolls royce quality of education either. If there are two programs that yield the same result, the school district may opt for the less costly of the two.In the Burlington case, the supreme court ruled that parents may be reimbursed for money paid out of their own pockets for special ed programs provided that school's IEP was found to be inappropriate and the program the parents chose conferred benefits. The Rowley standard is used.The next case was the Shannon Carter case in which the supreme court ruled that parents could be reimbursed for educational services by the school district if they sent their child to a private school even if the services were conducted by noncredentialed teachers or uncertified personnel. This decision was made in 1994 and is of great interest, because it paved the way for commercialization of ABA programs. The next court case after this was Malkentzos vs. DeBueno.  The school district argued that because the parents used uncertified college students as therapists for the autistic child's ABA program that they were not under obligation to pay for the treatment, but because of the Carter decision they did not prevail and the court ruled that ABA or any other autism intervention (one not requiring licensure under other laws) need not be done by credentialed persons.  Because of this decision, there was no need for anyone operating an ABA program for autistic children to hire anyone with any particular qualifications. Many of the Lovaas therapists are now college students or even teenagers not old enough to legally buy a six pack. We can start to see a pattern here that was started shortly before the mid 1990s, which paved the way for persons to have an incentive to get an autism diagnosis because of the availability of this therapy. The study published in 1987 by Dr. Lovaas alleged that nearly 50% of autistic children could have completely normal functioning if 40 hours a week of this therapy was done. Of course Lovaas' study was dependent on the use hitting children and possibly other aversives. Aversives were outlawed in California in 1991 and possibly some other jurisdictions as well, but the method was still marketed and promoted albeit dishonestly.One interesting case that was talked about in the article was a mother who tried a variety of alternative biomed treatments for her son in addition Lovaas-style ABA. The alternative treatments were certain diets involving only white food. At other times the mother administered electric shock in order to kill any parasites or yeast that she thought her son might have. Also bowel cleansing and liver stimulation treatments were used that had been recommended by a naturopathic doctor. (the article does not say if this was a DAN doctor or DAN protocol or not). The child regressed academically. The mother claimed that it was due to the discontinuation of the child's lovaas therapy, while the school district claimed that it was the naturopathic treatments as well as the child's insufficient diet. The hearing officer did not rule in either party's favor but ordered that the child receive testing and evaluation at a local children's hospital. In thinking about the school districts willingness to cave in to parents' demands for treatments in order to avoid litigation in the Vorhees township, it must be remembered that New Jersey has the highest prevalance rate of autism of any place in the country. One interesting study might be to assess the litiginous of parents in New Jersey and the number of lawsuits that occur there as opposed to someplace like lets say Alabama where the prevalence rates for autism are substantially lower.  Some people have suggested that parents move to New Jersey in order to obtain better services for their kids in great numbers because they have more comprehensive ABA and other special ed services there.  The 2007 report published by the CDC suggests against this, claiming that the majority of autistic children receiving services in New Jersey were born there.  It does not rule out children within New Jersey moving to other school districts though or the likelihood of litigation in New Jersey and possibly other factors. Furthermore we seem to see a pattern here between a variety of special education law supreme court decisions that would make it easier for parents to obtain certain types of treatment for their children throughout the 1990s and a corresponding increase in autism diagnoses.  One must wonder if this temporal relationship can be cause and effect.  So far no one has shown any environmental reason for increases in autism diagnoses in spite of the insistence upon it by the folks at the Age of Autism webpage and other places.  Much time and energy has been spent trying to see whether or not vaccines are responsible for an autism increase with one study after another showing that vaccines had nothing to do with this.  James Gurney at the university of Minnesota published a paper showing a huge increase in autism diagnoses in correspondence to changes in federal and Minnesota state special education laws.  Perhaps it is time for more study on the relationship between changes in the legal system and increases in autism diagnoses'  Food for thought.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/07/legal-system-and-idea-impact-on-autism.html", "title": "\nlegal system and IDEA impact on autism\n"},
{"date": " July 28, 2008", "body": "\nCelibacy is a real problem for many autistic males. You don't get to hear about it much because the powers that be only publicizes writings of successful autistics like Stephen Shore who can get married and Temple Grandin, a female who claims to be celibate by choice. The problems of the invisible autistic adult are ignored and people act like autistics remain peter pans. Most of the internet autistics do not write much about this problem. Trust me, it is there, it exists. The interested reader can search for David Miedzianik in google and find some interesting things on this topic. Prior to about 1991 or 1992 David was possibly only one of the two persons in the world on the autistic spectrum who had written published autobiographies of any kind. The only other person being Temple Grandin, a female autistic, who wrote the work with an assistant author. Except for some minor editing David's work is really his, but he never got very far. His is a very sad saga indeed which I may blog about at some point in time.I am over 50 years old, somewhat overweight and have no job. My prospects for finding romantic bliss are not too promising. However, who says we autistics have no sense of humor? What a rotten stereotype some people seem to make about us. Therefore, I can show that I have a sense of humor and can make some light out of a bad situation, so here are a few interesting quotes and quipsabout sex  as they could pertain to autism that I encountered some time ago that put a smile on my face. Hopefully they will put a smile on yours too.First there is the story of the autistic adult virgin who went on a date and thought he was going to have sex. He asked his date if she brought any protection and she nodded and pulled out a switchblade.Lord Chesterfield on sex: The pleasure is momentary, the position ridiculous and the expense damnable.Disraeli on marriage: Every woman should marry but no man.Here's a good one from the late George Carlin: The celibate autistic can always remember that sex has its consequences. When Hitler's mother spread her legs out that night, she prevented about 15 million other people from spreading their legs.Truman Capote on Masturbation: The good thing about masturbation is you don't have to get dressed up for it.Woody Allen on Masturbation: Don't knock it, at least it's sex with someone you love.Or the one about the autistic guy who was only capable of concrete thought. His dad told him about the birds and the bees. He ended up going steady with a woodpecker until he was 21.Charles Bukowski: A man can go without sex for 70 years, but he can die in a week without a bowel movement.Well that's enough, have a nice day all :)\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/07/humorous-quotes-to-take-sting-out-of.html", "title": "\nhumorous quote(s) to take sting out of celibacy.\n"},
{"date": " August 7, 2008", "body": "\nYes, your eyes are not playing tricks on you. This is a statistic that Asperger's author William Stillman says he believes will happen. Actually he says In fact, I\u2019m going to predict that within five to ten years, the rate in the United States will jump to 1 in 10 children. He states this in his blog post http://www.basilandspice.com/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=1070760&categoryId=181865 . Stillman seems to think that autism is some sort of new stage in human evolution and that this is a preordained plan from God as far as I can tell. He has written a book called Autism and the God Connection which I have not read but now may have to try to read as well as his other books, since he is a writer with such an interesting perspective. He says that he has a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome. He seems to take an interest in the entire autism spectrum, though Asperger's syndrome in the cases of many people who claim to have it is very different from classic autism, which I had as a very small child, where I could not speak at age 3. So even if 10% of all children born around 2005 or so, are not autistic by 2013 they will be by 2018.I am going to try really hard to remember this prediction and write about it in 5 years and then in 10 years, if I am still alive at that time and able to write about it.Stillman makes this video in which he claims that increases in autism prevalence are analogous to evolution. He compares the evolution of homo sapiens from homo erectus, neanderthal man and more primitive forms of humans that apparently took thousands of years, to the increases in autism that have only taken place in the last 20 years (I guess I should say alleged increases). He also makes the common error of stating that the prevalence rate for autism in 1990 was 1 in 10,000 to show how much autism has been increasing. Going back to studies done in the United States in the early 1980s and the Lotter study done in England in 1966, prevalence rates for autism were 4/10,000. The 1 in 10,000 figure comes from a study published around 1970 by Darold Treffert in the days when very few people had heard of autism and certainly no one would have even thought that people of normal intelligence could claim to have autism. Certainly Stillman himself would not have been thought of as autistic during the time this study was done. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only published epidemiologic study that has a prevalence figure that is this low.Stillman is not the only person to make this mistake or use this statistic to make a supposed autism epidemic or increase look worse than it really is. Jenny McCarthy on television did the same thing, though she gives the 1/10,000 date as 1983. Dr. Robert Hedron, who is in charge of the MIND institute used this statistic also at ASA 2008 when he was one of the keynote speakers. He gave the year 1993 when the prevalence was still supposedly 1/10,000.Like many neurodiversity adherents Stillman seems to find virtues in autism, saying they need less words to speak and aren't into competition and aggression.Though Stillman seems to think that autism is the next step in a positive evolution, he does not seem to deny that autism can be a problem for some and that autistics need some sort of help. In fact, he has a consulting service in which he charges $100 for phone consultations. He won't do email consultations for ethical reasons, but for some reason thinks that talking to parents on the phone for $100 is somehow ethical. He won't accept payment from parents directly but apparently from school districts and other providers. Stillman states that he has a bachelors in education. Other than that, I am not exactly sure what his qualifications are to make these consultations and charge $100 an hour except that he is a guy who has published a few books and claims to have asperger's syndrome.  If this web site is accurate, http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/55/11/1323, Stillman does not even have a diagnosis of an ASD by a trained clinician, he is self-diagnosed as Asperger's, yet he can get books published and apparently can make judgements over the phone about kids he has never met. He will only do the consultations in one hour increments which I presume means that he won't charge $117 for a 70 minute consultation, but will either charge $200 for it or insist on a full two hours. I suppose because of the supreme court's decision in the Shannon Carter case which said that parents can legally have school districts reimburse them for programs in their IEPs that use non credentialed personnel means that Stillman can do this and have school districts reimburse him for these consultations.In spite of claiming that at least a one hundred dollar one hour consultation is needed Stillman claims in one article he wrote, http://www.williamstillman.com/archive/autism-a-new-cultural-competency.html that all he needs is ten minutes with an autistic child to tell his parents exactly what they need. This seems to be a record for omniscience among autism clinicians credentialed or otherwise.I may have to spend more time reading this guy's web page and articles to glean more interesting insights from this absolutely fascinating spectrumite and autism author. I may have to revise this blog post or at least add to it if and when I find more interesting tidbits of info.I realize I will have to be patient to wait five, maybe ten years to see if Stillman's incredible prediction comes true. I remember one parent of an autistic child I met at a conference about four and a half years ago who stated that because thimerosal had largely been taken out of vaccinations that the autism rate in the California state regional centers would go down to about 4/10,000 by about 2007. Certainly that prediction did not come to pass. I think I can wait and see if Stillman's prediction comes true.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.basilandspice.com/display/ShowJournal?moduleId=1070760&categoryId=181865", "http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/55/11/1323", "http://www.williamstillman.com/archive/autism-a-new-cultural-competency.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/08/autism-prevalence-1-in-10-children.html", "title": "\nautism prevalence 1 in 10 children by2013,  2018 at latest???!!!\n"},
{"date": " August 8, 2008", "body": "\nA past figure for autism prevalence that is sometimes bandied about is the famous 1 in 10,000 prevalence that, at least in some instances, those who state this figure, claim that this is a recent prevalence figure for autism. In the latest post in Dad of Cameron's blog, http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=191#commentspediatrician Jay Gordon gives a 1-2/10,000 figure of autism in the 1980s. As I have mentioned in a couple of previous posts Dr. Bob Hedron who heads the MIND institute claimed in his ASA presentation that the 1 in 10,000 figure was the autism prevalence as recently as 1993. As those who read my previous post will remember autism author and consultant Bill Stillman cited a 1/10,000 figure  for 1990. also David Kirby author of the book trying to demonstrate that autism may be caused by vaccines entitled evidence of harm claimed the prevalence was 1/10,000 in 1987 http://www.evidenceofharm.com/ Well, there seem to be others that claim this.The observant reader will remember in my last post about Bill Stillman and his use of this number, I stated that this figure, from what I knew about it, came from a study done by Darold Treffert that was published in 1970.I have looked at an interesting article on Dr. Treffert's web page about this study and some other issues in the field of autism here: http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant_syndrome/savant_articles/autistic_disorderApparently Treffert's study originally found a prevalence of more than 3/10,000 of autism rather than the 1-2/10,000 number that is often preached by those who claim we are in the midst of an autism \"epidemic\" as if it were gospel. So where does this 1-2/10,000 number come from?In the study, Dr. Treffert did a survey between 1962-1967 of what was then called childhood schizophrenia. Though the term autism has been in existence as a noun since 1943 (it has been in existence as an adjective since 1911) it was never added to the diagnostic nomenclature of the DSM until 1980. Dr. Treffert divided the children into three different groups. The first group had classic Kanner type autism, which I think was the type that was originally defined by Kanner in 1943. The second group had non-classical autism. These children would probably be labeled PDD/NOS nowadays. The third group was \"probable autistic features with organicity\". One must remember that at the time this survey was carried out in the 1960s, it was believed in large part that classic autism had an emotional etiology rather than an organic one, which is probably the reason for the third group in Treffert's study. Approximately 25% of these children were part of the first group with the classic Kanner's autism. This is what probably accounts for the 1/10,000 figure that is quoted by these people. But is this 1/10,000 figure really rational? One would have to say no, because attitudes about autism diagnostic criteria have clearly changed. The 2007 CDC study which accounts for the famous quoted 1/150 prevalence included all parts of the spectrum, autism, PDD/NOS, Asperger's, etc. It is also possible that children with problems like CDD and Rett's which nowadays might be counted as separate disorders from autism were also counted.Since Treffert was collecting the data from his study between the years 1962-1967 and the study was published in 1970, I am not sure where the years 1987 from Kirby, 1990 From Stillman and 1993 from Bob Hedron and the 1980's 1-2/10,000 figure  that Dr. Jay Gordon cites come from. This still remains a mystery.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=191#comments", "http://www.evidenceofharm.com/", "http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant_syndrome/savant_articles/autistic_disorder"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/08/1-in-10000-really.html", "title": "\n1 in 10,000? really?\n"},

Dr. Sowell writes about late talking children. These children have this trait in common with autistic children at age 3, yet end up being able to talk and have none of the social or other problems in common with autism. The most famous example of this, of course was Albert Einstein.Dr. Sowell states in his article that he believes many of the children diagnosed as autistic are in reality just late talkers and are not autistic. He also talks about autism and late talking child researcher Stephen Camarata at Vanderbilt University. Many of the parents of late talking children that Dr. Camarata comes into contact with have been told to get a diagnosis of autism for their children in order to be eligible for government services including speech therapy. Dr. Sowell speculates that this may be the possible reason for the huge increases in autism prevalence that are being reported. He also talks about research done by Ellen Winter of Boston College who finds among children who score very high on standardized IQ tests, huge obsessional interests and the desire to be alone and isolated. Interestingly, these are characteristics that have commonality with autism spectrum disorders, particularly asperger's syndrome.Dr. Sowell correctly (at least in this blogger's humble opinion) states that the parents and these children need to be spared the trauma of these misdiagnoses. Much money will be spent on unnecessary treatments and the children may suffer needless emotional issues.It seems to me that this very interesting article has many implications for many of the issues that have been bandied time and again in the autism community.Sowell has written about Albert Einstein, the favorite role model of various neurodiversity afficianados, who, at least in some instances, want to make autism into some sort of romantic thing. Since Einstein followed many of the same patterns of the late talking children that Sowell writes about, this is one of the number of things to suggest he may not have been autistic after all. Therefore using Einstein as one of the arguments against trying to cure autism has no bearing. Also, the notion expressed by some neurodiversity adherents that autistics can do just fine when they are older loses its credibility because of this. These late talkers who are likely not really autistic will only end up being a gun with blanks when used as ammunition by the neurodiversity community for promoting their misguided agenda.Dr. Winters research also may suggest that some persons who are diagnosed as having Asperger's symptom, may be engaging in just normal manifestiations that are a commonality in certain children without disabilities but merely have high IQs. It seems for this reason a diagnosis of Asperger's should be marked \"fragile, handle with care\". Perhaps many of these so-called aspies who often flock to neurodiversity are not really on the autism spectrum at all. What about persons at the other end of the extreme from neurodiversity, for example those who advocate treatments such as chelation and/or ABA as the salvation of those with autism? What can these late talking misdiagnosed children mean for their misguided agenda? Thomas Insel who heads the NIMH has recently given the greenlight for a controlled study involving chelation of autistic children. Is there a logical reason to do a controlled study on chelation? Study after study has shown no association between mercury and autism. The studies which show an association may have certain problems, such as the Geier's use of the VAERS database to support their findings. In this database people have entered that their children became Wonder Woman or The Incredible Hulk from vaccines and it was accepted. The fact that Mark Geier seems to have conflicts of interest in that he has filed patents for Lupron as an autism treatments and I think a couple of other patents? The fact that in his correspondence to me he claimed the reason for increased prevalence of autism in California between birth years 1970 and 1990 in spite of the fact there was only one thimerosal containing vaccine was in part due to increasing uptake of the DTP vaccination. Yet Dr. Geier cannot explain the absence of a pertussis decrease which would have had to have been of a much huger magnitude than the corresponding autism increase. He also claimed the number of shots had increased from 3 to 5. Yet this man who claims he is an expert on vaccines should know that the fifth shot is a booster shot given at age 5, which would be inconsequential for a child getting autism. Also the results of the Palmer study, which tries to show a relationship between the percentage of kids with autism and how close they live to coal burning plants in Texas are questionable. Though I have not read the study, Michelle Dawson on her comment board claims that there were only four years of exposure to the coal plants that were studied, yet the numbers include children from ages 3 to 18. Also Palmer does not control for children moving into the districts and presumes they were all born in the school districts where the coal producing plants were. If there is any legitimate association between any other heavy metals and autism I am unaware of it. There does not seem to be any evidence for trying chelation. Yet, the demand by parents is so great for easy quick fix solutions for autism they are willing to try anything. Some of these parents claim that this has produced miraculous recoveries for their autistic children. Assuming that Dr. Sowell is correct is it possible that some of the children who underwent chelation were not autistic in the first place. Perhaps they were just late talkers. This would negate any success claimed from chelation, either for the study that Dr. Insel has given the thumbs up for, any study to be done in the future or any parent who follows this and other DAN protocol treatments who claims a \"recovered\" child. In at least some cases, it is quite possible their child was a late talker. Of course, the solution touted is controlled studies. Ivar Lovaas' 1987 study is touted as scientific evidence for the efficacy of ABA because the control groups and the experimental groups were supposedly identical at intake. Yet, there were problems with this study. The experimental and control subjects were not randomly assigned and there are huge discrepancies between the two groups. There is a ratio of autistic males to autistic females of 4:1 that is consistently found on average in various studies. The ratio of boys to girls in the experimental group in Lovaas 1987 was about this. There was near parity between the two sexes in the control group. Most of the literature shows that girls are often more severely autistic than boys, particularly in the low functioning groups. This would seem to negate the credibility of Lovaas 1987. It was also revealed that one of the 19 controls in Lovaas' study had Rett syndrome, a very unique autism subtype that is found almost exclusively in girls, so this person would likely have had a poor prognosis regardless of what treatment was done. This girl was reported in another study that Lovaas published on the ineffectiveness of ABA in Rett's. There were two other girls in the Rett's study, one of whom lived inNorway. The other two girls were both identified as being in the Lovaas Young Autism project that was going on at UCLA at the time. They both underwent 10 hours a week of ABA, the same amount of ABA that was given to all 19 subjects in control group one of Lovaas' 1987 study. So, a very germane question is were there one or two girls with Rett syndrome in the Lovaas control group. If only one of the girls but not the other was in the control group, this opens up other questions. What other types of research was lovaas doing at the time. What other studies did he do where subjects were receiving ten hours a week of ABA and not 40 hours a week?Also, the results of Lovaas' study were highly dependent on the use of physical aversives, such as hitting and electric shocks and food deprivation. The Hughes act of 1991 outlawed the use of aversives in the state of California where I live and where Lovaas did his research. This means that ABA without aversives is marketed dishonestly by special educators. It also means that the science of ABA is incompatible with U.S. special education law that offers ABA as post and parcel of a \"free and appropriate\" education for autistic children at least in California and other jurisdictions where aversives are banned.Probably a good number of parents of autistic children report recoveries or at least fantastic results due to ABA therapies with their children. Is it possible that at least some of the positive outcomes of children who undergo this therapy is due to the fact that they are not really autistic but are late talkers?If there is someway to control for this confounding variable that may result in reports of favorable prognoses for autistic children and the pie-in-the-sky claims of certain neurodiversity adherents it should be done. Dr. Sowell in the article claimed though he is an economist and not a psychiatrist, psychologist or chelationist said that because of this he could produce high rates of recovery for autism. These are indeed points to ponder.What about people who really are autistic rather than late talkers. Is it possible for them to recover, at least partially? The answer would seem to be yes and yours truly would seem to be an example of that phenomenon.In 1958 when I was three years old the intervention of choice was psychoanalysis. No one who preaches the Bettleheim gospel is taken seriously nowadays. Yet during the first year I underwent psychoanalysis in the late 1950's, I went from being a severely nonverbal autistic to being verbal, having normal intelligence and to a large extent recovering, though definitely not 100%. My psychoanalyst took full credit for my partial recovery claiming it was totally because of her treatment.Hopefully late talkers and spontaneously recovering autistics will be taken into account before ABA, chelation and neurodiversity are taken seriously.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZDZiZmYyNWNmMWJhNWM5Y2M5OWZkMmIzM2I5YTU3M2I=&w=MA"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/07/will-real-autistic-please-stand-up.html", "title": "\nWill The Real Autistic Please Stand Up\n"},
{"date": " August 10, 2008", "body": "\nI have just found out about an interesting activity that Autism Speaks may be involved in. Unlike many persons in the autism community I have defended Autism Speaks' when I felt they were being unjustly attacked by neurodiversity proponents and those in the \"mercury militia\". I am also a supporter of the scientific research that Autism Speaks funds (well probably most of it) and the desire to find a cure for autism and prevent children from becoming autistic. I might even donate some money to them if my financial situation ever improves. In the past I have donated money to CAN before they got gobbled up by AS, but not AS itself since they have existed.However, when I feel they have done something wrong or even if there is a possibility of wrong doing,  I will write about it in Autism's gadfly. As the few regular readers of this blog know, I have done this previously when I found out the lab that Michelle Dawson works in received funding from AS. Also, when I found out that Morton Gernsbacher was a guest reviewer on their scientific advisory board I wrote about this too.  These individuals have been consistently involved in activities counterproductive to finding a cure and preventing autism and I felt that this should be brought to attention.Well here I go again.  I am still intrigued by \"$100 buck an hour phone consultation\" Bill Stillman whom I have written about in the last two blog entries.  I have still been reading some past blog posts of his http://www.williamstillman.com/blog.html and I found out that he has written a document that he is claiming will be included in a community school kit that autism speaks has just come out with.  Here is the link for info about the school kit that Stillman was talking about  http://www.autismspeaks.org/press/school_community_tool_kit.php  On reading this link, I can't find anything specifically about Stillman.  It just states that there is an appendix which includes certain articles.  So, I am not positive that they are including any advice from this individual or not. Autism speaks seems to be broadening the scope of the purpose that they were first intended for, i.e. providing funding for scientific research.  Most likely due to parental pressure to do something for children in the here and now, they have expanded their scope to scholastic problems.  I have somewhat mixed feelings about this.  I believe that this organization should just stick to scientific research and not be a multipurpose organization and have message boards and social networking boards like the one they are apparently now in the process of developing.  I think this new internet page on their website is supposed to be an autistic myspace of sorts.  Of course, if there was something that could be done in the here and now for children, I would be for it, ergo the mixed feelings.  However, I am really skeptical that a community tool kit would provide any answers for people trying to mitigate the problems that autistic children have in various school situations.  Even if something could be done, it would probably be better done by other organizations.  AS would probably be  better off just spending all of its resources on scientific research to find a cure and prevention of autism as soon as possible. This sort of thing is not unprecedented.  Before the existence of AS, CAN had in its bylaws that they would only provide funding for research into the biology of autism.  They violated their own bylaws by funding one of Lovaas' studies and also some stuff that Lovaas' proteges Laura Schriebman and Bob Koegel were doing.  This is in spite of the fact that Lovaas has received considerable NIMH funding and yet has never submitted any adult outcomes of the children in his 1987 study to peer review.  This was one of the criticisms I had of CAN when it existed.  Interestingly enough, Dov Shestack, whose parents founded CAN,underwent ABA. At the age of 16, he cannot speak.  I would think they of all people would not want to fund ABA as it would appear that this intervention was not very helpful to their son.  I don't know if autism speaks has any relationship with Stillman or not or whether they included anything that he wrote in their school community tool kit.  However, even the possibility of this is troubling to me.  This is a person who charges $100 an hour just to talk to people on the phone about kids he never met.  Other than an undergraduate degree in education, having published a few books and diagnosing himself with Asperger's I am not sure what qualifications he has.   He also apparently charges for in person consultations, though he says the person must inquire about the fees.  He has claimed that he can tell exactly what an autistic person needs after only spending ten minutes with them.  He claims that he is certain that autism prevalence will be 1 in 10 persons by the year 2018 at the latest.  He seems to think autism is some sort of positive stage in evolution and that it is being directed by divine providence. I thought that it was crazy that AS would fund a lab that employs Michelle Dawson and allow Morton Gernsbacher who writes articles saying autism should be accepted and not be cured and that there are severely autistic people who have made great contributions to arts and the sciences would be a guest scientific advisor and review research grants.  I thought it was bizarre of autism speaks to publish John Michael Carley's piece, articles of understanding.  Carley, is someone who found out that he had Asperger's at 36, just decided he had Asperger's after his son was diagnosed with an ASD and was able to make a good living and support a family and is another example of one of those \"autistics\" who has the gall to speak for me and claim that most autistics don't want to be cured.  But if AS is really including things that Stillman wrote in a community school kit, this pales in comparison.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.williamstillman.com/blog.html", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/press/school_community_tool_kit.php"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/08/possible-faux-pas-by-autism-speaks.html", "title": "\nPossible faux pas by autism speaks\n"},
{"date": " July 18, 2008", "body": "\nI was interested to read this post on age of autism http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/07/autism-speaks-t.html#more and this post on John Best's hating autism blog. http://www.hatingautism.blogspot.com/ As the readers of autism's gadfly will remember, some time ago, I wrote a post about the irony about the war between the mercury militia and the neurodiversity movement when the groups were so strikingly similar in certain respects. At the risk of immodesty it looks like I may have been prescient.All the more delicious is the irony of the well known adversarial relationship between John Best and Amanda Baggs.As par for the course of absurd statements that seem to appear from time to time on age of autism is Handley first stating that because gene therapy involves single genes and autism genetics is multifactorial that this makes it unlikely that gene therapy will be able to do anything for autistic people in the foreseeable future.  Be that as it may, Handley then goes on to use the apples versus oranges comparison of autism and down's syndrome that the neurodiversity people make with the questionable statistic of the 90% abortion rate of down's fetuses that neurodiversity afficianados spout like whales.  He then goes on to contradict himself and make the ill-informed statement that Down's syndrome involves a single gene.  JB you might be interested to know that Down's does not involve one gene, it involves an abnormality of an entire chromosome, namely three 21st chromosomes instead of two.  This is so different from multigenetic etiologies, it is not an apt comparison.  If autism involves multiple genes instead of one chromosome this makes the idea of prenatal screening anytime in the foreseeable future pretty far fetched.  Like your detractors in the neurodiversity movement you don't seem to realize this. Interestingly enough, one of Handley's commenters on the age of autism blog disputed the 90% stastic about Down's syndrome that he and the neurodiversity people quote religiously, giving some evidence it was more like 62%.  So how many autistic fetuses would really be aborted?One can go to http://www.autistics.org/ and see that the people there had this same idea a long time ago when they look at the cartoon about CAN.I guess Amanda and her friends there have no plans to sue the mercury militia people for ripping off their idea.I seem to remember there was some research on Fragile X recently that would dispute the ideas of these two fringe organizations. Wish I knew more so I could comment, but the irony of the war gets sweeter and sweeter. Course no reason why amino acids in a gene's or multiple gene's DNA could not be rearranged somehow to avoid certain mutations that could predispose one to autism. Course admittedly that is a long way off but neither of these two groups don't want to acknowledge this idea. There is also the idea that some sort of diet could be developed for an infant vulnerable to autism due to a genetic metabolic error. This is what happens in phenylketonuria, where a diet free of tyrosine can prevent retardation in an infant. I seem to remember some babies with phenylketonuria have been considered autistic.Maybe someday I will be able to do more research to dispute the idea, but my autism is too severe for that right now.However, once again I can have a good laugh at the ironies of this ongoing war between the two groups to inject a little humor into my somewhat difficult life.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/07/autism-speaks-t.html#more", "http://www.hatingautism.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autistics.org/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/07/jb-handley-and-john-best-pull-rabbit.html", "title": "\nJB Handley and John Best pull a rabbit out of Neurodiversity's hat\n"},
{"date": " August 11, 2008", "body": "\nAbout 18 years ago, I was absolutely intrigued to read a column in the Advocate, the ASA's newsletter by Temple Grandin describing an autistic man named David Miedzianik who had written a published autobiography. Up until that time, I had never heard of anyone besides Temple herself who had written an autobiography or memoir. I had already read Temple's book, but it did not completely resonate with me. Part of the reason being our different genders. I was interested in the types of problems an autistic male had, particularly the problems with celibacy that seem to befall so many of us.Grandin gave David's address and said that he was interested in hearing from readers. I wrote him, telling him I was another male on the spectrum and I was interested in obtaining his autobiography and reading it. He wrote me back telling me where in England I could get it and it would cost about 7 or 8 pounds (about 10 or 11 dollars). I was not sure how to send away for his book on an international basis. He included a phone number and I phoned him. We talked. He had a strange accent and manner of speaking but I was able to understand him. He agreed to send me his book and I sent him twenty dollars through the mail. He sent me the autobiography along with a long poem he had written entitled \"I hope some Lass Will Want Me After Reading This\" As soon as I had read the title of his poem I knew I had found a kindred spirit!I read the introduction by Elizabeth Newsome, the university of Nottingham professor who had asked David to write the book. Written in about 1986 or 1987 she commented that as far as she knew David's book was the only one of its kind other than Temple Grandin's book which had been written with the help of an assistant writer. David's book was written entirely by himself. When David first submitted it to Dr. Newsome he asked her to correct it. Except for some minor punctuation and adding a few paragraphs she did not find it necessary to do so. Also, Dr. Newsome commented on what I thought was the germane fact that David was a member of the majority gender among those on the spectrum and cited the figure of as high as a 10:1 ratio of males to females in the higher functioning autism groups.When I first started reading David's book it did not interest me greatly. It was just minutae about David's relatives and did not seem germane to anything particular in my life. After dragging for a bit the book started to hit home. David talked about taking piano lessons and having to stop due to poor coordination. This hit home with me because of my own motor coordination problems. He also wrote about bullying he experienced in school. He described a ritual that occurred in British schools in the 1960s called the first year clip where older boys would hit younger boys about the ears and he thought he got it more than anyone.He also talks about how he would get dizzy in movie theatres and this lead to his having to go to mental hospitals at various times during his life. David also talked about being fired from various jobs. The longest he had one job was for six weeks stacking pallets in a bakery.Most compelling of all was David's description of the constant rejection he received from women. This is a subject that is rarely talked about in autism circles, though I suspect it is a very common problem among adult autistic males. As far as I know, David and myself are the only ones on the spectrum who have written about this subject. If there are others I would certainly be interested in knowing about them.He writes about a nurse he met on a political march whom he was interested in but the interested was unrequited. He would put ads in singles magazines and then the girls would write back and ask him what job he had. They would find out he was unemployed and that would end his prospects. He writes about a girl named Amanda (not Baggs) whom he is attracted to. She makes it plain she has no romantic interest in him. David sums up his book:Living is more or less a constant bore. If it were not for the writing I think I would haveEnded it all but the writing has given me reason to carry on.David goes on to write about a couple of suicide attempts. First he takes an overdose of medications he was prescribed to control his behavior, but they only made him very tired. Another time he drank a bottle of Fairy Liquid (this British dishwashing soap) but only made him sick and did not kill him.I would talk on the phone with David and he would sometimes repeat himself \"when are you going to get us to America\". I would get excited that David wrote this autobiography and told him that he was the only autistic male in the world who had written about his life's experiences and that he should be famous and an important person. (This was at least a couple years prior to Tom Mckean's book coming out, Sean Barron's and several years before Steve Shore wrote his book). I thought it unfair Grandin got so much attention and he got nothing. Uta Frith wrote both about Temple and David in her book Autism: Explaining the Enigma. She gave Temple's full name and cited her book as a reference in the bibliography. She did not give David's last name and did not cite his book in the bibliography. \"All my life I've gotten the dirty end of the stick\" David would reply when I pointed this out to him.I wanted to help David and I suggested that he write to Bernard Rimland and tell him about himself. David wrote to Rimland and the ARI and he just got a form letter and was sent some vitamins and magnesium supplements. I then suggested that David write to Oliver Sacks. David took my suggestion and wrote to Sacks' who responded by saying that David's poetry showed strong emotion but did not take an interest in David. I published a positive review of David's book in \"The Momentum\" which was the newsletter of the Los Angeles chapter of the ASA. After this whenever I talked to him on the phone he would ask, \"Can you get us some write-ups?\" and would say this over and over again.At one point it seemed that David had finally gotten a break as a producer of British plays had taken an interest in turning his autobiography into a London stage play. David was excited because people came from all over the world for London theatre.Eventually David would correct me when I went on perseverating about the fact that he and Grandin were the only persons in the world to have written an autobiography. He told me about someone I had never heard of named Donna Williams who had written an autistic autobiography. Actually the term could be changed to autiebiographies. I think it was Larry Arnold who first started using this term, which I ended up using too, many years later. Donna had been one of the numerous persons with autism, including myself, who had read about David in various autism newsletters in the days before the internet. She had also accepted David's invitation to correspond with him. I told David that I felt he could still take solace in the fact that he was still the only male autiebiographer.In April of 1992 I took a trip to England in part to visit David. After a few days in London I took a three-hour train ride on British railway from London to Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England. David lived in Rotherham which was very close to Sheffield. I was met by David and his friend of the family Marjorie who was in her late 70s. I would stay with Marjorie and her husband. David and his mum could not put me up because she was very ill from Parkinson's disease. David shook my hand tentatively. He seemed shy about meeting me at first and then showed me the outline of the tentative stageplay that was in the works based on his life. David showed me his copy of Donna's book, Nobody Nowhere, which had not yet been published in the United States. David gave me the book and told me I could read it as he had already read it and was not any longer interested in having it. This meant I would be getting a jump on most of the American reading population and would be able to read Nobody Nowhere before most of them did.David had also taped a British national television program featuring Donna. He played it and we both watched with interest. I looked over at David who sat there stoically watching it. I could see the pain on his face as his aspirations to get notoriety from his book had again been trumped by another.I was interested to note that David made similar stimmy motions to myself with hand flapping and rocking. I was between jobs at the time and intended to look for another job when I got back to the U.S. David would say, \"there's a job for you\" as soon as we would pass a construction site. Sometimes he would pick his nose and say, \"stinkinman and robin\" over and over. Another repetitive and compulsive phrase that he would say was, \"take your autistic tablets\".Now that David had met me and he wanted to get out of the house due to his mother being so sick, David asked me if he could visit me in the U.S. for about a month. This seemed a long time and i was reluctant, but i finally said yes. I was a little concerned about David's behavior but felt it would be okay.My friend, Jerry Newport, who also had an autistic spectrum disorder and I had met at various autism meetings in Los Angeles came with me to pick David up from the airport. This would make it easier for me to get out of the car and go into the terminal and find David while Jerry would drive my car around the terminal. Jerry had read David's book and was also interested in meeting this VIP from England. David would sleep on my couch. David decided to call Temple Grandin now that he was in the U.S. He told me that sometimes she was busy and would not return his phone calls. The phone rang and I answered it. Temple was at the other end of the line asking for David. Temple and I spoke briefly but then I put David on the line and he talked with her also. I suspected that normally she might not return the call, but she was surprised David was in the U.S. and decided to call.I told David that while he was in the United States I would do what I could to get publicity for his writings. Jerry knew a reporter from a local Long Beach newspaper. This reporter phoned and was interested in talking with David. David was normally very slow moving due to being placed on Haldol to control his behavior. However, I was startled at how fast David moved when I told him a reporter was at the other end of the line to talk with him. The reporter asked David a few questions and hung up. We never heard back from him, apparently he had lost interest. I also took David to some lectures and meetings that the local Los Angeles chapter of the autism society offered. David sold a couple of the books that he had brought with him.I was wondering if maybe Eric Courchesne could do something to help David. I had been a research subject in a few of the studies that Courchesne's lab had done. They were in San Diego, a two hour drive from Los Angeles. I also thought David might be interested in seeing what San Diego, a popular Southern California tourist attraction was like. Courchesne was a well-known autism researcher and possibly influential in the field of autism and might be able to drum up some publicity for David.I phoned the lab and talked to Jean Townsend, one of Courchesne's associates at the time, and she said we could come visit her in the lab. We drove the two hours down to the lab and met Jean. She had heard of Elizabeth Newsome and was interested in David's book and we gave a copy of one of his books to the lab.David then met Courchesne and I explained to him about David being the only autistic male in the world to have written a memoir of any kind. Alan Lincoln, who also worked with Courchesne at the time, did a short research project with both of us as subjects. We also had a videotaped interview.I knew that now was as good a time as any to broach the subject of helping David with Dr. Courchesne. Courchesne replied, \"There are some people coming over from Japan who are interested in autism and I will tell them about the book when they arrive.\" Strike 3 or maybe 4 or 5! It now seemed futile to try to do anything else further to help publicize David's book.After David got back from England, he had another setback. The stageplay fell through and it seemed the producer had turned out to be more of a wannabe than a legitimate producer in the world of London theatre. David had travelled to London numerous times at his own expense to meet with this man to assist in the development of the play, so this had been a big disappointment. David's mother also died at this time.After this, David would travel constantly, staying with our mutual friend Kathy Lissner-Grant who lived in Denver and who had also taken an interest in him and would put him up annually. When she got tired of putting him up, he ended up staying in a hostel. He also had an aunt in Canada whom he would sometimes stay with. He had a terrible time in England with constant problems with neighbors and social workers being meddlesome now that his mother was deceased, thinking David incapable of looking after his own affairs. On occasions they would even go as far as recommending some sort of institutionalized living arrangement for David such as the British equivalent of a group home. It seemed that his motto should have been have autism will travel.About 8 years ago, David came and visited me again and stayed for three and a half weeks. This was the last time I saw him in person. David had started getting a bit more publicity. He had a mention in Tony Attwood's book which was a huge commercial success as an Asperger's book. He had also been written about in Francesca Happe's and Uta Frith's book Autism and Asperger Syndrome. He was still unhappy and not really satisfied with the way his writings were going and not able to sell much of them still in spite of the slightly increased publicity. David's frustration about his lack of success with women continued. He even went so far as to write a post on a usenet newsgroup demanding a girlfriend.David would ask Kathy, his aunt and myself to put him up. But we knew he would just want to stay in our homes constantly if we acquiesced, so David sort of wore out his welcome with all of us, but he would still travel to the U.S. and stay in either a hostel or hotel. Eventually the Immigration service in the U.S. found out that David had stayed many more days in the U.S. than his visa would allow and he was not allowed entry into the U.S. and transported back to England the last time he tried to come to this country. He tried to get his visa renewed but to no avail. As far as I know he still travels to London and sometimes takes a ferry to France to avoid all of the problems he has in Rotherham with his social workers and neighbors.He would also advertise for a girlfriend on the internet after the drastic step of demanding one on the usenet did not help him. David seems to fit the autistic stereotype of lacking theory of mind. He fails to understand the point of view of others. He does not understand why people would tire of letting him stay in their homes. He does not understand why advertising for a girlfriend on a web page or demanding a girlfriend in the usenet newsgroup will not yield him results.Though David was a trendsetter as the second person to publish an \"autiebiography\" of any sort and the first male to do so, many others have now filled this void. Those include Tom Mckean Stephen Shore, Sean Barron, Daniel Tammet and others. David still lives in complete obscurity a forgotten landmark on the autism map. Most of the published memoirs of autistic people show success stories. Could it be that people don't want to know what the true prognosis is for most autistics rather than these few exceptions to the rule? David himself summed it up nicely in a usenet post:The reason I have done badly with the stuff I write is that I give a very good picture of what it is like to be autistic. Temple Grandin sells so many books because she is hinting that autistic people can grow up to be a Ph.D. I am hinting that autistic people may end up in a Sorry mess and people do not like that. Temple Grandin's books are true for her, but not for the vast majority of people with autism. My poems really give a much more accurate picture of what being an autistic adult is like. Her stuff gives the idea that things are OK with autistic people when they're not. This is dangerous as people read this stuff and think that things are Ok and autistic kids will grow up to be Ph.D.'s. Then the next thing is that nothing gets done for us and we have to suffer all the more. This is very dangerous stuff, these books, and they do no favors to people who are really suffering with autism and things end up not being done when they need to be done. In about ten years' time when people's kids are not Ph.D's people will be asking for their money back from this stuff. Well, maybe not, but you can see what I mean. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/08/have-autism-will-travel-sad-saga-of.html", "title": "\nHave Autism Will Travel: The Sad Saga of David Miedzianik\n"},
{"date": " August 14, 2008", "body": "\nI see that my friend Steve Edelson, who took over the ARI after Bernie Rimland passed away is promoting secretin as an effective autism treatment over at http://www.ageofautism.com/. I have met Steve at a couple of the national ASA conferences. He was very nice to me and I like him personally, but I still question a lot of positions and treatments that ARI proposes. He bills secretin as one of the most promising autism treatments ever.Secretin is a hormone that appears in the GI tract and is involved in aiding the process of digestion. It also appears in the brain. As Steve points out, there are studies showing that it appears in parts of the cerebellum and hippocampus and limbic system, areas that have been implicated in the etiology of autism.Steve cites the initial anecdotal evidence of the effectiveness of secretin in this boy named Parker Beck, and the uncontrolled subjective observations of this boy's improvement. He then mentions a pharmaceutical company which got the rights to the patent of synthetic secretin, which was cheaper to make than the secretin which was extracted from the duodenum of pigs. For some reason, I don't understand, Steve implies that somehow the molecules of the secretin extracted from pigs is somehow different from the kind that can be synthesized in a lab. Maybe someone with more erudition in chemistry than I have can explain to me why the organic secretin would be vastly different than the synthetic variety in its alleged effects on autism. The drug company did some studies using these two different subjective autism rating scales and determined that secretin was not effective overall. Yet when a subset of high functioning autistics were assessed it was found that they had made statistically significant improvements on one of the ratings but not on the other. Steve goes on to define the statistically significant changes on only one but not both of the rating scales as having \"improved dramatically\".He then goes on to make the claim that the owner of the pharmaceutical company had a conference telephone call with the company's stockholders claiming that several of the children in the experimental group went from autistic to normal (italics added). How 'normal' was assessed in this alleged phone call I have no idea. As far as I can tell the only measures used in this drug company's study were two autism rating scales. No standardized tests were used to assess the children after the porcine (from pigs) secretin was used, no reports of scholastic placement, and certainly no adult outcomes, how they fared in jobs, heterosexual relations, etc.Finally Steve tries to show the need for further research on secretin. He cites a study done by Janet Kern in Texas who found that about a quarter of the autistic children in an experimental group who received the porcine (non-synthetic) form of secretin improved in some of their behaviors, in terms of throwing less tantrums and having an improved vocabulary. The only children in Kern's study for whom the secretin seemed to be effective were those with GI problems. Secretin was no different than a placebo for autistic children without GI problems.It is interesting to note that Kern in a more recent study on heavy metals in the etiology of autism has collaborated with ARI board member James Adams, so it would appear she has some sort of connection to Steve Edelson himself.Though Steve calls for more research to be done on secretin he neglects to address in his piece the fact that numerous controlled studies have been done showing secretin to be ineffective as an autism treatment.In a study done by Sandler, et. al in the New England Journal of Medicine a comparison was made between 28 children with autism injected with the synthetic version of secretin and 28 controls. The authors noted no difference between the two groups.Another study published by Chez in the annals of neurology also showed that secretin was ineffective as an autism treatment.A review showing 15 studies showing secretin to be an ineffective treatment are reviewed here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15590241?dopt=AbstractSo far as I know, besides Kern's study, the only other published report of secretin being an effective autism treatment was produced by someone named Hvorth published in an obscure publication entitled the journal for the association of academic minority physicians. This study was an uncontrolled study involving only three children.Steve Edelson really fails to address or mention or critique any of these studies that refute the evidence that secretin may be a worthwhile autism treatment and that further research into secretin as one of the most promising autism treatments should be pursued. As far as I can tell his only criticism of these studies is that they used synthetic secretin rather than the porcine secretin that was extracted from pig intestines. He does not mention why the porcine version would be more effective than the synthetic version or chemically what the difference is. Even in Kern's porcine secretin study, a very small minority of the children improved and only those with GI problems. Out of all the persons with autism in the world, what percentage have these GI problems. Steve does not address this point.  Another possible reason that synthetic secretin is used rather than the porcine version is that introducing a substance from a pig could cause the human immune system to have an adverse reaction.  Though I will admit I am not an expert in this, it seems to me that it would make sense that because the human immune system would treat this as some sort of foreign agent, treatment with the pig secretin could be harmful to autistic children.   Is it possible that after reading this article on the age of autism web page, some parent whose autistic child does not have a GI problem may end up seeking secretin as a treatment.  Parents of autistic children are desperate people and easily exploited, so this does present a problem for me.  There seems to me no evidence that secretin is a legitimate treatment for autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15590241?dopt=Abstract"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/08/is-secretin-effective-treatment-for.html", "title": "\nIs Secretin an effective treatment for autism?\n"},
{"date": " August 19, 2008", "body": "\nMark Twain once said that the reports of his death were grossly exaggerated. Twain's words certainly ring true for proponents of various autism theories and treatments. After years of studies of refuting thimerosal and vaccines as a cause of autism, this hypothesis is still not allowed to rest in peace and is kept alive by those who believe in it.Another treatment, Secretin, which ten years ago was one of the flavors of the month as an autism remedy seemed to be in abeyance over the past couple of years or so. Recently ARI director, Steven Edelson, who took over after autism icon Bernard Rimland passed away has writen an editorial on ARI's website trying to revive interest in this treatment as a line of autism research: http://www.autism.com/treatable/drug/secretin_org.htm. As regular readers of autism's gadfly will remember, I posted about this a couple of postings ago.I emailed Dr. Edelson and pointed out that I had responded to his editorial, which the age of autism webpage had linked to. He seemed rather upset and felt that I had not been entirely honest or perhaps had not read the editorial carefully. He felt I should apologize to him and the readers of this blog.Though I did not entirely agree with him he may have had some valid points. I said that he had stated that secretin was one of the most promising treatments ever. He said that he only felt that more research needed to be done to see whether or not this would be an effective treatment. Though the title of his editorial inferred that secretin was a promising treatment. He said that it had the potential to be one of the most effective treatments for autism without using the word 'ever' This did confuse me and maybe I was mistaken about that, but he did seem to me to think that there was more than just a need to do research and this might be a viable treatment. I also commented on Janet Kern whom he had stated had shown evidence that secretin was an effective treatment for autism. I had discovered that she had collaborated with James Adams, a member of the board of directors of ARI and she might have a connection with Edelson. He seemed to think I was implying something dishonest was afoot. He did admit to me that ARI had funded at least one study that Kern had done and that they had every right to do so. I agree. However, connections between a funder and a fundee need to be known as the parties may not necessarily be disinterested parties, this is just my opinion. I don't know what Dr. Kern's interest, financial and otherwise at the current time might be in Secretin or who else if anyone besides ARI funds her research. However, one thing I was able to find on the internet was that according to journalist Arthur Allen, Victoria Beck (the person whose son was the first anecdotal report of a person helped by secretin) and Bernard Rimland sold the patent for secretin to the drug company Repligen, who was first seeking out FDA approval for its use in treatment of autism and schizophrenia for one million dollars and about $700,000 of this went into ARI's coffers: http://www.salon.com/health/log/1999/12/09/secretin/print.html this same article states that after the one company that manufactured porcine secretin stopped producing it supplies dried up and secretin was being sold at prices as high as $15,000/vial. ARI does have the right to fund whom they want, I agree and Dr. Kern's findings have been published in the journal of autism and developmental disorders where the interested reader can judge for themselves the validity of her findings. I will have more to say about her findings later and I will apologize if there was any misunderstanding. Still, this is not the end of the story. There is still more stuff about this controversial substance.Another thing I did not understand in the last post was that Steve was commenting on the fact that most if not all of the multiple studies that had refuted the evidence of secretin as a promising autism treatment had only used one dose of secretin and there was a need for more multiple dose studies before the final verdict on secretin was in. This was in addition to his statement that porcine (organic secretin extracted from pig intestines) was different chemically than the human synthetic secretin that was used in some though not all of the studies that refuted secretin.I found one article and an abstract of another article on the internet in which multiple doses of secretin were administered: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/107/5/e71http://www.jrnldbp.com/pt/re/jdbp/abstract.00008480-200306000-00020.htm;jsessionid=LrmPTLSJpyP0TpGMC8v02p3Vnr19ChYRnvcSmBnv3Pmvwsx2mb86!-1124491571!181195628!8091!-1?nav=referenceAs far as I could tell Steve had not read these articles. He said that he would try to go to the research library the following morning and write an updated editorial for ARI and let me read it first. I still have not heard back from him. He also told me about someone named Cindy Schneider who had done a study showing that in a higher dose than usually given secretin had shown some results in persons with autism. As far as I could tell, from looking at the web, back issues of ARI's newsletter on the web and doing a pubmed search, this lady had never actually published her findings in a peer reviewed journal but rather had just presented them informally at a conference. If Steve or someone else will ever show me where Cindy Schneider has published in a peer reviewed journal, I will write an update.I decided to do a bit more research. I read the article by Sandler which appeared in NEJM many years ago, He did acknowledge that his study used synthetic secretin rather than porcine secretin and the fact he only used a single dose, and that further work was needed to elucidate this. On doing my research I found that there had been studies by someone named Crist which appeared in a GI journal showing that the two different secretins have similar modes of action and effects in the body in spite of the fact that they have slightly different molecular structures, differing by two amino acids. It was conceded that this difference in molecular structure might mean they had different effects, but there was no evidence to show this.One of the problems I have with the single dose thing is that the anecdotal reports of Parker Beck's improvement, the uncontrolled study involving three children published by Horvath, and Janet Kern's study showing improvement in a small percentage of the children in her study all involved a single dose of secretin. Therefore, this might preclude the argument that research with more than one dose of secretin is necessary. There have been studies showing secretin in mutliple doses is inefficacious, but more on that later.In Kern's study the only children for whom secretin seemed to have any benefit were for those who had chronic diarrhea. What percentage of kids with autism who have chronic diarrhea is unknown. In one study, Karin Nelson even refuted that there was any relationship between GI symptoms and autism. Though, I think there are other studies that refute that. Apparently the relationship between autism and GI symptoms is not clear. Therefore, this would seem to dispute Steve's contention that secretin really has any potential for the vast majority of autistic persons. In his editorial he neglects to state that this might have potential only for a small subset of autism and in his comments on Kern's study, he does not mention the fact that the subset of children who had improved were unique in that they had chronic diarrhea and that Kern conceded secretin would only be helpful for a small percentage of those on the spectrum.Also there was a report by someone named Sturmey who reported on the 15 controlled studies all of which had found secretin to be ineffective in the treatment of autism. I could not find this report on the shelves at the UCLA biomed library.However I did find another report that had been published about a year earlier in 2004by Barbara Esch and James Carr on the research literature on secretin and autism. This was published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders. They talk about multidose secretin studies. In one of the studies done by Roberts which I think I linked to earlier, Steve E. claimed that the dosage was too low to get any positive results. He stated that Schneider, who I mentioned earlier had failed to get the same results from her work. But then got positive results after administering a higher dose, which was a single dose that Steve said he objected to before. As I mentioned before, I don't think Cindy Schneider's work has ever been published in a peer reviewed journal.Also Sponheim et. al. have done a study involving multiple doses of secretin, I think I linked to the abstract of this study. These dosages were higher per kg of body weight than other studies involving secretin which would answer steve's concerns about dosages in the Roberts multidose secretin study.Another issue that is addressed in this paper is that it is not known whether secretin crosses the blood-brain barrier in humans, though there is some suggestion that it might as there was a study showing it crossed the BB barrier in mice. However, if it were found that secretin did not cross the blood-brain barrier in humans this would probably negate its use as an autism treatment.Another issue, that I mentioned in the previous post is that continued injections of porcine secretin may be dangerous because of an immunologic response to pig matter. Also, there is the question of those who promote multidose secretin as a treatment for autism, showing there is no danger. Secretin is currently used in single doses as an adjunct in GI procedures. I think this is the only use that has been approved by the FDA so far. It is not known whether multiple injections of even human synthetic secretin would not be dangerous to autistic children.For these reasons I think caution should be exercised.Though Steve seems to be implying that more research is needed to determine whether or not secretin is effective, i am not sure if he feels that way about the DAN protocol. If any of the DAN protocol (aside from the megavitamins which I think were published in some places) has been published in the peer reviewed literature, I am not sure what it is. Steve claims that 20% of all autistics that undergo the DAN protocol can become recovered. He uses the analogy of someone being hit by a car, and then undergoing physical therapy, and then just maybe walking with a slight limp so that you would never know they had an accident. He says that this is different from a cure, but seems to imply that these 20% responders can function pretty much normally in any way though may have some subtle differences.I don't think any studies on secretin have been published in the past few years. If Steve can stop interest from waning and ARI or someone else funds more studies I will await the results. Though it does not seem to me based on what has been published that secretin has any promise whatsoever. As said before, there is certainly no evidence suggesting it has promise for any autistic person other than those who have chronic diarrhea.There may be more updates in autism's gadfly about the fascinating saga of secretin so stay tuned.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autism.com/treatable/drug/secretin_org.htm", "http://www.salon.com/health/log/1999/12/09/secretin/print.html", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/107/5/e71", "http://www.jrnldbp.com/pt/re/jdbp/abstract.00008480-200306000-00020.htm;jsessionid=LrmPTLSJpyP0TpGMC8v02p3Vnr19ChYRnvcSmBnv3Pmvwsx2mb86!-1124491571!181195628!8091!-1?nav=reference"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/08/secretin-controversy-continues.html", "title": "\nSecretin: The Controversy Continues\n"},
{"date": " August 22, 2008", "body": "\nToday I read a blog entry by Zach Lassiter whose claim to fame was the Zazzle t-shirt fiasco where autism speaks was wrongly accused of trying to block his t-shirt that was unflattering to them. He writes aboutproblems with his work. One of the things he writes about is the fact that his employer knows about his autism spectrum disorder. Yet disclosure of his disability has not seemed to have helped this young man with his work problems. Disclosure of a diagnosis is given as a solution to the problems of employment for persons on the autistic spectrum. I tried this one time in the past and it still resulted in my getting fired from a job. Michelle Dawson also did this with her employer Canada Post and apparently it cost her the job she had with them and I think she has been litigating this for a number of years. Also, I know of one computer programmer whose disclosure did not help. Another person whom I knew who worked in a public sector job whose autism caused them serious anger management problems and social judgment impairments. Because of poor social judgement he used the computer for unauthorized uses, had numerous angry fights with the boss and was transferred to a mail room position within the organization where he had no access to an email account or computer. The pressures he experienced finally forced him to resign. Had he been employed in the private sector he would have been fired. They were aware of his diagnosis when he was hired. Disclosure did not help him.Among the many simplistic answers given by neurodiversity proponents is one ND person who claims that if people did not get the idea that autistics were toxic waste dumps and people did not get the impression that autistics were bad, then employers would hire them and they would not have problems in the workplace. This solution is akin to disclosure. It is one of the simplistic solutions that neurodiversity people offer that makes their movement so dangerous.What if someone were to apply for a job and tell the prospective employer that they had an ASD. What are the chances they would be hired? The interviewer would realize that if the person feels a need to disclose their disability there must be something wrong with them. One argument made for disclosure is that some autistics may have sensory problems, like certain bright lights affecting them, or certain perfumes or other things with a distinct odor that co-workers might use that would be a bother to the autistic employee. What are the chances of the whole office accommodating them? Also, if the accommodation were minor and did not put too much of a burden on the company, it is possible the person could just say, they might like to work in a room without bright lights. Assuming the autistic person's deficits were so mild that they had no other liabilities, then this might be all that is necessary without telling them about the specific diagnosis of autism.If the person with autism has trouble concentrating and makes an above average amount of errors, who would think that the employer would make accommodations for this just because the person has autism? This is certainly not realistic. What if it was a job for which is usually not the forte of an autist, for example sales jobs where there is a lot of social interaction and behavioral issues involved. If they are not competent at this job due to autism, is it realistic to think this will be overlooked when disclosure is done?What if the person in spite of their autism was just as competent or even more competent at doing the job as the NT? They might ace all of the pre-employment tests. Certain idiosyncracies that they have might not come out in the wash right away. Their problems might not be terribly overt at first blush. Then they are hired to do the job. They are an incredibly good worker. Perhaps the best worker in their office. But they talk in a very loud voice. They demonstrate poor social skills when engaging in small talk with their co-workers. They might make \"stimmy\" movements. They might flap their hands, make strange facial grimaces and scowl at people who might become frightened thinking they were angry. Would knowing this person has autism save them from being fired? I believe the answer is no. The employer might be too polite to tell the person they are being fired for their behavior. They might come up with a completely bogus excuse, for example claiming they are running a productivity study on the employer and then falsifying the study and claiming they are much too slow. This happened to me at one of the jobs I was fired from. If the person has problems with executive functioning and does not shower properly or have proper hygeiene, will their foul B.O. be tolerated just because they have autism, again, no.These things should be common sense to anyone in the autism field or to any person who knows anything about what happens in the workplace to autistic people. Those not on the spectrum have never walked a millimeter in my shoes let alone a mile. They have no notion of what happens to us in the workplace and how hard these things are. Some of these people can only give \"an ivory tower\" analysis of the situation.Disclosure is still given as a quick fix simplistic answer. It misleads persons with autism and their loved ones that there is an easy way out. Some of these might be very mildly 22 year old autistic kids (at nearly 53 i consider someone 22 a kid) who have never been in the workforce and whose relatives are not autistic so they don't understand. They will think it is okay to disclose their diagnosis. They think it will not matter to the employers. They are mistaken. This is a dangerous mode of thought.I admit I have no alternative to disclosure as an easier answer for those on the spectrum, but for those who are old enough to remember the old Hannah Green story, autistic persons were never promised a rose garden.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.aspieweb.net/work-is-not-good-aspergers-autis"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/08/disclosure-in-workplace-for-autists-is.html", "title": "\nDisclosure in the workplace for autists, is it helpful?\n"},
{"date": " August 28, 2008", "body": "\nI just read an interesting entry inDonna Williams blog just now.  I have never been a fan of Donna Williams.  I read Nobody Nowhere many years ago, a brief time before it was published in the U.S.A.  I obtained a copy published in England from David Miedzianik in the early 1990s.  I did not feel the book was very well written and had a hard time understanding how it became a best seller.  I was also skeptical that Donna really had autism.  Her symptomatology sounded far more like a multiple personality disorder such as was in the book Sybil, popular back in the early 1970s. I was very pleased to read some very good common sense notions of hers on neurodiversity that I agree with.  Though I am not sure if she agrees with everything that I believe about neurodiversity I totally agree with the following statement:I think the ND idea is also based on the presumption that others are NT, or neuro-typical, which I don\u2019t believe.  Non-spectrum people are really diverse in their own right and all humans are atypical in some way.  When I sit with those fixated on so called NT stereotypes, the stereotypes are represented by movie characters and celebrities in gossip magazines but don\u2019t actually hold up in a large percentage of general society.  Yet is one self isolates on the presumptions of a THEM and US reality, soon enough the stereotypes become unchallenged, presumed realities.  And built into the term NT is a supremist view that all great advancements in society were only and ever due to those who were Neurodiverse.  Well Hitler was also pretty atypical, so was Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao.  It\u2019s a matter of who one chooses as one\u2019s icons.  And one could be fairly typical yet out of need, accident or default, have a remarkable discovery, invention, innovation which even surprises themselves.  So I think the political camps are very populist, at times supremist in their stance, and I just don\u2019t do wars.This is a very profound statement and I thank Donna very much for making it (thanks if you happen to read this, Donna). Especially enlightened was the Hitler metaphor.  Hitler's behavior could have been considered autistic.  He certainly was a loner in his youth, high school dropout, outcast from society.  Yet he does not make the neurodiversity list along with Albert Einstein, Bill Gates and Thomas Jefferson.  I wonder why? Also, are any two brains exactly alike?  Therefore there is diversity among NTs as well as among individual autistics.  If the hypothetical cure for autism could happen would it mean that everyone would be the same, one size fits all, no.  Absolutely not, we would still have real neurodiversity.  Not the scam and the cult that so many embrace as their opiate.I hope to see more good statements from Donna Williams, particularly about the neurodiversity movement.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.donnawilliams.net/2008/08/28/autism-smorgasbord-in-manchester-and-sheffield/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/08/donna-williams-profound-comments-on.html", "title": "\nDonna Williams profound comments on neurodiversity\n"},
{"date": " August 14, 2008", "body": "\nThe repeated use of the word 'retard' in the recently released movie, Tropic Thunder, has created a figurative hornet's nest amongst the developmentally disabled community. Autistics in the neurodiversity groups and the parents in the pro-cure camp with whom they are usually at loggerheads with have found a common cause celebre'. Some have gone so far as saying that the word retard, should not be used in art in any context. Certain persons have called for having the scenes from the movie cut that use this foul slur. One person has even gone so far to say that Ben Stiller should donate money to the special Olympics as compensation.Even the infamous John Best has entered the fray. Instead of referring to those he disagrees with as neuronitwits or neuroinsane, he has now started to call them retards. He seems to think he has found a more effective way of baiting those he has so much contempt for.Because of all of this, I have a rather shocking confession to make to all of the readers of autism's gadfly. 14-1/2 years ago I wrote a short story entitled \"Mr. Twiddle\". This story uses the word 'retard' multiple times. Also the expression RETARDS 'R' US in red bold faced letters was also used in the story.  The story is on my jonathans stories website: http://www.jonathans-stories.com/stories/twix.html for the interested reader.  The story deals with the problems of a high functioning autistic boy and whether or not he can be mainstreamed in regular school, I won't go into the rest of the story as some reader of autism's gadfly may actually give a shit and want to read it and I would not want to ruin it for them.  The point is, my use of the word retard was done as an art form to show how nasty and cruel typical children can be to those with developmental disabilities.  I realize the situation with Tropic Thunder is different and the word retard is not used with this type of literary device in mind, though I don't think Ben Stiller was trying to defame the developmentally disabled in any way.  However, some of these people feel the word retard should not be used in any context.  I beg to differ.  I believe that sometimes literary devices like this are necessary to prove a point.  If I had used the expression, 'geek' or even 'autistic geek' for example it would not have been as powerful a device in the story. A number of persons have read it and though a few did not seem to care for the story.  I did get some positive reactions from a number of people. No one has yet objected to my use of the R word in the story.  One of those readers of Mr. Twiddle was from someone in the neurodiversity movement calling (I think herself) Ventura who has a fiction web page.  She emailed me and wrote me that she liked my story very much and wanted to publish it on her page even though she realized I had a low opinion of the neurodiversity movement.  I said that sure I would be happy to have her publish it if she wanted, I am willing to have a civil relationship with persons in the neurodiversity movement and others even though we may disagree on some things.  So this is another shocking confession I have to make, I agreed to have someone from the neurodiversity movement publish a story on their web page.  She did not seem to mind that I used the expression retard in the story.  I would think if this were offensive, she of all people would have objected.  A few others have emailed me telling me they enjoyed the story.  These were people on the spectrum, some of whom I think at the very least had a neurodiversity leaning.  So one has to wonder why if using retard in any context should be verbotten then why were they not offended. I submitted the story to about 9 or 10 magazines and every single one of them rejected the story.  However, I did get some positive reactions from a couple of the rejectors.  I sent the story to one publication, Glimmer Train Stories, which is considered pretty top tier in the short fiction publication world.  The editor wrote on the rejection slip, \"quite a moving piece, enjoyed it thank you\".  The Michigan Quarterly Review was having a special issue devoted to disabilities.  I suspect these people would not have wanted a story that defamed disabled people in any way or would not have made any positive comments.  Though they also took a pass on the story, they said that the way that I presented the cultural attitudes towards the autistic were compelling but in my writing I should pay attention to characterization of my characters as well as how a story unfolds from beginning to end. All of these things compel me to believe that there are at the very least exceptions to the rule where certain words can be used in a certain context as part of an art form.  The use of the word nigger in Huckleberry Finn and the fact that this book is used with great frequency in high school and college literature classes in spite of the N word is one example.  The novel The Catcher in the Rye uses flit as a pejorative term for a homosexual, but apparently gay rights groups are not trying to remove this classic from the bookshelves at Borders' and Barnes and Noble.

{"date": " September 1, 2008", "body": "\nA recent article appeared in the Modesto Bee talking about an 11-year-old boy named Effie Linares who has been given as yet another anecdotal example of ABA's efficacy as an autism intervention. The boy is shown in the article smiling with three of his good friends. A seemingly happy boy untouched by the misery of autism that affects children in many instances causing suffering. The article talks about how he is mainstreamed in a fifth grade class in a regular school.But is this really a success story? The article does not really give a clear before and after picture of the boy's functioning level, other than talking about how at one time he went ballistic when other people touched his Disney videos which at age 11 he no longer does. But what proof is there that natural maturity just caused him to outgrow this behavior and there was no casual relationship between the 40 hour per week Lovaas treatment and an end to this behavior? Also, the article states that he was mainstreamed since the age of 5. It is possible he was always quite high functioning relative to other autistic children. We can't really tell anything from the article.Lovaas claimed in 1987 that nearly half of his best outcome subjects in the experimental group had completely normal functioning, in other words, no one would possibly know that they were autistic or had ever been autistic. Is this the case for Effie? The answer would appear to be no from a read of the article. He still has a shadow that aides him in his class so the mainstreaming is not 100% and does not jibe with the Lovaas best outcome subjects who had no aides or shadows. Effie's father also has to work the night shift in order to volunteer in the school to help out his son. To me, this does not sound like normal functioning or a complete success story. Effie's teacher also states that he says and does things that show he is different to the other kids, so it would seem that this boy is not indistinguishable from his peers. The article neglects to talk about his academic performance in relation to the other children in his class.Most pertinent of all, what will happen when Effie becomes an adult? Will he be able to hold down a job, date women? As an autistic adult who by most standards is very high functioning, I have had no success in finding a girlfriend and though I worked sporadically for nearly 28 years, I finally gave up the ghost it was so difficult and I had such a hard time in the work place. I have written in the past about the lack of acknowledgement of the existence of autistic adults and how we are not Peter Pans. Someday we will grow up and have all of the issues of adulthood to contend with, just like Neurotypical persons. Of course no one is thinking of what might happen to Effie and other success stories when they become adults. No adult outcomes, have ever been published in the peer reviewed literature of autistic children who have undergone ABA. The informal presentations at conferences, while seemingly a shoddy standard of science, have been used to claim successful adult outcomes and provide cost-benefit analyses of ABA as a treatment.Even as far as anecdotal success of ABA as an autism treatment, the oldest success story that I am aware of is that of Drew Crowder written about in the book Autism from Tragedy to Triumph. He is in college when we last hear about Drew. I have yet to hear of any adult success stories even though the children in the 1987 study are now probably about 40, some possibly older.The playwright Bertolt Brecht said that those who laugh have not been told the terrible news. Though this is something that parents of autistic children don't like to think about, the the stark reality is there.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.modbee.com/local/v-print/story/413437.html", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/invisible.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/09/effie-linares-lovaas-success-story.html", "title": "\nEffie Linares, Lovaas success story?\n"},
{"date": " September 10, 2008", "body": "\nI have just sent the following email to the IACC as per their request for input by September 19:Hello, I am a high functioning autistic male who wants a cure for autism.  I am responding to your requests for information by September 19 as per your request.  I was wondering if the lauren Mottron lab receives funding by the NIMH and under the combating autism act?  If so I believe their funding should be discontinued as they have at least one person who undermines the nobel effort to find a cure for autism.  This person has written an essay implying that people who want to cure autism are intolerant bigots.  Also there is an autism researcher named Morton Gernsbacher who wrote an essay, autistics need acceptance and not cure and makes unfounded statements that severely autistic people have made great contributions to the arts and sciences.  I was hoping that her funding would also be discontinued and that she will no longer be allowed to peer review scientific articles that have been funded under the combating autism act. Also, I believe that Mark Blaxill's and Lynne Redwood's membership on the IACC should be discontinued as these two cling to the disproven hypothesis that thimerosal causes autism and will only impede advances into finding a cure for this disorder, much thanks.  I realize this will probably be about as effective as writing a letter to Santa Claus but at least I was able to get my frustration over people who I believe are undermining a cure off my chest.  I might at some point write the IACC about ideas I have for research rather than trying to do something about certain individuals who I feel undermine the effort to prevent and cure autism.  Some people may feel I am engaging in a personal attack or being vindictive but this is not the case.  Though I have not worked in a while I have paid probably more in taxes than the vast majority of those on the autistic spectrum (this of course excludes neurodiversity \"asperger's persons\" who decided well into adulthood that they had an ASD after finding out their child had an ASD) so I feel that I have a right to give some input on these individuals.  I have really suffered as a result of my ASD and if people think I am a bad person for writing this letter to the IACC and posting this publically and naming certain individuals in my email so be it.   \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-letter-to-interagency-autism_10.html", "title": "\nMy letter to the interagency autism coordinating committee\n"},

{"date": " September 11, 2008", "body": "\nAs most persons interested in autism know, yet another study has shown that MMR vaccinations have no relation to autism. The purpose of these studies which undoubtedly involve the expenditure of funds and time seems to be in order to convince parents to go ahead and vaccinate their kids.  This money could be spent on doing legitimate scientific work that could prevent and cure autism, or even help pay for job training programs or housing for autistics.The latest study is nothing new. Many studies before this have shown evidence that not only does MMR have nothing to do with autism but thimerosal in vaccines and mercury don't either. Yet what is the point of doing study after study. There is clearly nothing that will convince a good number of parents that their offspring's autism was not caused by vaccines. We only have a vicious circle that in my opinion accomplishes nothing. In fact, in order to determine that there was no relationship between thimerosal and autism all one has to do is look at the 2003 update of the california report on the prevalence of autism showing that between birth years 1970 and 1990 when there was only one thimerosal containing vaccination prevalence of autism tripled. I have written about this.Various explanations were given when I asked the persons pushing the vaccine hypothesis about this. Sally Bernard claimed that due to new laws mandating vaccination for school attendance caused a huge increase in uptake of the DPT vax. Mark Geier also made this same claim to me and added that at one time there were only three shots given to a child and then the number increased to five. The problem with this is that there would have had to have been a corresponding decrease in whooping cough over the same time period which would have been of a much greater magnitude than the corresponding autism increase. No more than three shots were ever given to a child before the age of 1. In UK where autism increases have paralleled those of the U.S., they have only had DPT as a thimerosal containing vaccine yet, only accelerated the schedule giving children shots at earlier ages during infancy. The fifth shot is a booster shot given to children at age 5 which obviously is inconsequential for causing autism.One of the most interesting explanations was given to me by Boyd Haley who claimed that there were a number of thimerosal containing products such as ophthalmic solutions and other things besides vaccines that increased from 1970 to 1990. Yet, as far as I know, SAFEMINDS and the other mercury causes autism groups have never shown any data of thimerosal containing products besides vaccines.Haley also told me in his correspondence with me that he could be convinced that there was no relationship between autism and thimerosal if a study were to be done comparing autism rates in vaccinated versus nonvaccinated children showing they had comparable numbers of children with the condition. It would seem that this argument is somewhat of an ace in the hole for those who believe that vaccines cause autism, they won't be convinced until such a study is done.About five years ago during a brief series of email correspondences that I had with Mark Blaxill, he claimed that there were problems with all of the studies done. He stated part of the problem that SAFEMINDS had in trying to dispute the data against their position was that they had nowhere near the resources of the government and ergo had an uphill battle. Mark Blaxill along with SAFEMINDS colleague Lynn Redwood currently serve on the IACC which controls funding and research directions in autism. They still cling to this thimerosal hypothesis which means this will be direction research is headed in part. The fact that these people are chosen to partly run the show most likely means that research into the etiology of autism that could result in finding a cause or even a cure will be greatly hampered.Yet, how valid is this limited resources argument of Blaxill's?  If I am not mistaken his fellow mercury militia members Tom and Sally Bernard have a net worth of upwards $300 million. Rick Rollens when I met him boasted to me how he raised $40 million dollars for autism research by founding the MIND institute largely at California taxpayer's expense. Autism speaks I don't think have assets totalling more than about $20 million. I am not sure of these figures but even if you want to give a more conservative estimate that the MIND institute and autism speaks have combined assets of about $100 million then this still might be less than a third of the Bernard family's total assets. Anyone can correct me about any of these figures if I am wrong or grossly overestimating the Bernard's wealth.Sally Bernard, if you read this, I am going to be a bit blunt. I think you should either put up or shut up. I think you and your husband Tom should fund that study of vaccinated versus nonvaccinated children and present the results to peer review. I am not talking about a journal like medical hypothesis where you published your autism novel form of mercury poisoning all those years ago, nor all of the amateurs including yourself who were involved in writing this and providing the data. I am talking about a real controlled study with hired professional scientists published in a much less speculative journal than medical hypothesis.  I think you can afford to fund such a study.  In the event that you can show much lower rates of autism in nonvaccinated children, all the power to you.  If not, then maybe this issue can be settled once and for all.  Perhaps you and Tom could pick up the tab for this study.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/thimerosal.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/09/vaccinated-versus-nonvaccinated-maybe.html", "title": "\nVaccinated versus Nonvaccinated: Maybe Tom and Sally Can Pick up the Tab\n"},

I posted to them about the errors of their ways just politely telling them they should be accepting of john best and not vilify him since neurodiversity is supposed to be about compassion and acceptance. It would seem it is very possible that John Best is on the autism spectrum. I told them they were being inconsistent in their philosophy if they did not accept him as one of their own. That in order to be consistent with their philosophy they should just be accepting of him. Dave Seidel countered with some stuff about how I was wrong. Someone else was asking why I am a person who is opposed to neurodiversity would be posting on wrongplanet. I told them I was just trying to show them the errors of their ways and that forums that preach to the choir are boring.Someone named Harry Brown then went on to claim that he has tried to be helpful to me in the past suggesting ways that I could work and get my writings published. Interesting I have never seen those posts. I have only just seen some nasty, angry comments about me that he has made on wrongplanet. What is more bizarre is that harry brown claimed he thought that my essay about undiagnosing gates, einstein and jefferson was not very good. He basically called it a high school essay, crap, said I was crass and superficial etc. Yet he seems to think my writing is good enough to be published if he has offered me help in getting my writings published in the past. That seems very strange to me. Mr. Williams seems very angry and often makes abusive posts from what I have seen. It saddens me he has to embrace a flawed ideology like neurodiversity just so he can feel better about himself.I tried to post a follow-up to Seidel's and William's nonsense and then was notified that I had been banned from the forum.I said nothing rude or nasty to anyone. I was very polite. It just seems that wrongplanet.net wants to engage in censorship. Some of the members it would seem complained to someone and got me banned from the forum. As is typical, in the neurodiversity movement, they are intolerant of anyone who disagrees with them. When I have deleted some posts here by people who were very abusive towards me, harassing me, trying to bait me, etc. They have cried censorship, etc. Once again neurodiversity seems to throw stones from a house made of extremely fragile glass.I guess there is no point in anyone trying to post on wrong planet who disagrees with anything they have to say as they are clearly intolerant and have no interest in having a dialogue with anyone.

{"date": " August 11, 2008", "body": "\nWell, I see that neurodiversity has a new cause celebre'. The use of the nasty slur 'retard' in this new movie that is coming out called Tropic Thunder. Ironically enough, Christ School, the producer of the hate film using the term 'house autistic' to describe autistics who want a cure, has made this new video trying to show what an awful term retard is. I am not sure what context retard is being used in this movie, but from what I have been able to gather at the very worst it is just an issue of poor taste among those who have produced the movie. There was no deliberate attempt to insult people with developmental disabilities by the people who have produced this movie as far as I can tell. If someone can show me evidence to the contrary, I will certainly stand corrected and I will denounce those who made tropic thunder as well. I would certainly never condone someone calling developmentally disabled people retards as a form of malice. I have been called this term many times in my relatively long life. If this is not the case however, the same argument could be made for banning The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in high school and college literature classes and from public libraries or possibly even from private book stores because it uses the word nigger multiple times. For some reason, I don't see the NAACP and other similar organizations trying to ban this book. Certainly the context Samuel Clemens was using this word in was not to demean black people.If one goes back to my previous post showing Christ School's house autistic film one can see that there is no question that this gentleman's goal is nothing short of being abusive and insulting to those who disagree with him about a cure for autism. The term 'house autistic' is unquestionably used as a slur with malice being the only purpose. When I posted a link to this individual's hateful video, he posted a bunch of vitriolic and abusive invective towards me in the comments section and threatened me with physical violence. Though I don't know how to link to this post and Mr. Christ School's comments, the interested reader can go back on autism's gadfly and see them. Normally I would delete such viscious and personal attacks but I kept them intact so that people who give a shit can judge the neurodiversity movement in general and the autism hub and ASAN in particular by the company they keep. The fact that ASAN would have such an association with an individual like this and promote a video like this only diminishes their credibility. It is certainly hypocritical of ASAN and Christ School to produce a film trying to show what a hateful expression 'retard' is, yet find it okay to call me and Marty Murphy \"house autistics\". I really don't understand why calling people with autism who desire a cure house autistic is any different from calling a black person a nigger or a developmentally disabled person a retard. Perhaps someone can explain that to me.What is ironic is that Christ School tries to imply that I and others like me are house autistics and he and other neurodiversity adherents are field autistics. He implies that the reason I state that I want a cure for autism is to somehow please parents of autistic children and other neurotypicals and that I am somehow trying to ingratiate myself with these people. It should not even be necessary to comment on such absurd baloney but here goes anyway. I have certainly not advocated the status quo in any of my writings. I have called for abolition of the IDEA, constantly criticized ABA, certain types of occupational therapy which I underwent as a child to help my fine motor and perceptual motor problems. Criticized generation rescue, safe minds and other groups who have claimed that vaccines cause autism. You can also see the posts about my questioning the 1/10,000 number espoused by groups claiming there is an \"autism epidemic\" Whatever parent or NT groups interested in autism that I am cowtowing to is certainly a mystery to me. I wonder what field autistic Christ school and his other field autistic pals in the neurodiversity movement know about the real problems that a lot of us face. Christ School apparently only found out he had Asperger's as an adult when his son was diagnosed as autistic. He is able to apparently make a good living, make these videos which I am too low functioning to make and get married and support a child. I doubt he spent a minute of his life in a special education school and that goes for the majority of those in the ND movement. What do these \"field autistics\" really know about autism from the inside out?Again ASAN is claiming to be doing something for autistic people. They and other disability groups have succeeded in getting part of the trailer of this movie that uses the term retard killed. When this movie comes out, there will be more urges to boycott it. But what will this accomplish? Recently a young woman sent an email both to me and my mom asking us how she could help her autistic son, who is finishing up kindergarten, breaking crayons, getting in trouble in his kindergarten for talking out in class and other behavioral problems. and all the problems she has to face as a mother of even a high functioning autistic child. How is this latest crusade by ASAN and other groups accomplishing anything to help someone like this. How did the absurd ransom notes campaign last year, help anyone with autism, except for helping Ari Neeman and some other \"field autistics\" satisfy their egos? Ari Neeman says that he is opposed to curing autism. He says that does not mean he is opposed to progress. How is this progress and how is an association with someone like Christ School who spits out vicious hate making progress?\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/08/retard-vs-house-autistic-and-more.html", "title": "\nretard vs. house autistic and more nonesense from the neurodiversity movement\n"},
{"date": " September 15, 2008", "body": "\nToday I read an interesting piece in the Los Angeles times about the relatively new high school exit exam that has been mandatory in california for a bit of time now.  2008 was the first year that special ed students were required to take it alongside their nonhandicapped peers. In spite of the pie-in-the-sky promises of the IDEA, ABA for autistic children etc., it came as no surprise that only 53.8% of those special ed students passed the exam while 46.2% failed.  So nearly half of all children in the california high school classes of 2008 who receive special ed services won't be receiving their diplomas.  By comparison 93.6% of non-handicapped high schoolers passed the exam. Sid Wolinsky from Disability Rights Advocates who tried to exempt special ed kids from the exam was quoted as saying that the psychologic damage to these children is horrific.  Dozens of parents of these children offered Wolinsky sworn declarations of their children's depression from failure of the exam.  It must be noted that the California state law only applies to public schools and private school students are exempt.  It was the class of 2006 who was first required to take this test.  Special education students were exempt in 2006 and 2007. State supt of public instruction, Jack O'Connell who sponsored the exit exam bill for then governor Gray Davis was quoted as saying that exempting special ed students from the exit exam was not helping them and setting them up for failure in the workplace. One of the reasons for passage of the Education for all handicapped act in 1975 (later to become the individuals with disabilities education act when it was reauthorized in 1991) was that if handicapped students were to receive educational opportunities, that this would help them succeed in the workplace and welfare, SSI, etc. would be greatly decreased for those handicapped children who received IEPs under this law.  Someone named Jacobson also did a cost benefit analysis of ABA for autistic children stating the exorbitant costs of ABA therapy were greatly exceeded by the costs of a life on the dole and claimed that ABA was saving autistic children from life on the dole.  The quality of science in this analyses was typically very bad, as no adult outcomes have been published in the peer reviewed literature for ABA.  Jacobson only used an informal presentation at a conference to prove ABA's efficacy in preparing adult autistics for the workplace. The IDEA has now been in existence for over 30 years, spending on special education increased 60 fold in less than a 30 year period.  One has to wonder if the nearly half of special ed students who failed the exit exam won't have significant problems in the workforce starting at age 22 when they are aged out of special ed services.  Perhaps it is time for reexamination of the IDEA and whether or not this law should be abolished.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/09/nearly-half-of-california-special-ed.html", "title": "\nnearly half of california special ed students fail high school exit exam\n"},
{"date": " October 1, 2008", "body": "\nRecently the IACC(interagency autism coordinating committee) has asked for ideas on the direction autism research should take from the general public with a vested interest in autism. Various blogs that are linked by the neurodiversity autism hub have commented on this and have urged persons to file requests.The autism self-advocacy network has not failed to miss the beat. They have made multiple requests to the IACC and how they should pursue an autism agenda that mirrors the same tired cliches propagated again and again by the ND movement. Not doing research with the intent of curing or preventing autism, not referring to autism as \"devastating\", or as a \"burden\". Also, they note the fact that only 1% of the NIMH's budget goes for services to help autistic persons and believe that this should be rectified.In one of the most bizarre statements they write:Right now, our interventions merely force autistic children to learn, think, behave, and communicate like non-autistic children. Instead, they should be taught how to learn, think, behave, and communicate like autistic children, so that they can maximize their capabilities.Along with ASAN president, Ari Neeman, this ND agenda is signed by some other persons as well including the author of the Joy of Autism blog Estee Klar-Wolfond.If I am not mistaken, Ms. Klar-Wolfond is a Canadian citizen not living in the United States who I am fairly certain has never paid a dime in American taxes. Yet she seems to think for some odd reason that she has a right to make suggestions to the IACC, which is a U.S. government agency created with American tax dollars. Last year, I wrote about two other members of the neurodiversity movement, Michelle Dawson and Mike Stanton who also were writing letters trying to influence the direction of NIMH autism research totally funded with public sector dollars, in spite of the fact that it is very unlikely either has paid any American taxes, yet they feel they have as much right as I have as an American taxpayer to make suggestions for directions U.S. taxpayer funded autism research should take.I would like to comment on some of these points. First, they seem to think there is something wrong with the fact that 99% of NIMH's budget does not go to these services they so covet. I think there is something wrong with it also, but only because instead of 99% of spending on medical research the NIMH's budget should be 100% funding of medical research. What Ari Neeman and his pals don't seem to understand is that this is the purpose of the NIH and NIMH. You notice the h stands for health. This is because being autistic is being in poor health. Someone who has autism has a disease, a disorder, etc, though I am not sure everyone in the ND movement understands this. This is why the NIH and NIMH were set up to fund medical research and not services. The reason scientific research is funded in autism is the hope to find more effective treatments including prevention and even a possible cure. Some persons in the ND movement seem to think this research is funded so scientists can pay their mortgages and amuse themselves. They should be lobbying congress for services if this is the direction they want autism funding to take, but not under the combating autism act.You notice the italicized statement about not making autistic children nonautistic but allowing them to function as autistic people so they can maximize their capabilities. Such incredible oxymorons seem to be par for the course for the ND movement. If they function like autistic people this means having language problems, self-stimulatory problems, inability to relate to people, etc. The only solution is for them to function as non-autistic obviously. The ND movement can't have it both ways no matter how hard they try. If they were able to function properly, they would be cured, they would no longer be autistic. Of course the ND movement fails to understand this.What is most interesting of all, the ND movement seems to want to take advantage of a law that they don't like. We can see examples of this here and here We see by the second example that the CAA was originally drafted by Cure Autism Now, the favorite whipping boy of the neurodiversity movement before they were gobbled up by Autism Speaks. This seems ironic that neurodiversity is clearly opposed to the intentions of this law, which are to prevent and cure autism, yet they want to take advantage of one of its provisions. Seems hypocrisy is pretty rampant in the ND movement. The main reason is that the neurodiversity movement is really very small and weak. The persons involved in it have limited capital and lobbying power. The internet gives the illusion that the ND movement is stronger and more powerful than it really is. This prevents them for being able to pursue their deranged agenda on their own and having to hijack the money that was set aside for something they oppose and for them to try to use it for something other than its intended purpose.This is aside from the fact that the IACC is pretty much a colossal joke. They have one person on the autism spectrum, Stephen Shore, who serves on the committee that was created for the purpose of curing and preventing autism, yet he himself is opposed to a cure for autism. They also have Mark Blaxill and Lyndell Redwood, who cling to the disproven hypothesis that vaccines cause autism, guiding the direction that research takes. Not that I think a cure for autism will be a reality in the foreseeable future even if the funding bodies did not make so many blunders, but having people like these three on the IACC does not bode well for future research.This complete hypocrisy of the ND movement is among the many reasons that I urge people to just say no to neurodiversity\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://asansouthwestohio.blogspot.com/2008/10/asan-coalition-comments-on-iacc-draft.html", "http://www.rettdevil.org/combatingthecombatingact.html", "http://www.aspiesforfreedom.com/showthread.php?tid=4370", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/neurodiv.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/10/neurodiversity-hypocrites-attempt-to.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity hypocrites attempt to hijack IACC and CAA\n"},
{"date": " November 14, 2008", "body": "\nThere is now some good news among persons who are interested in free access to peer reviewed journal articles that report the results of autism research.Autism speaks has announced a new policy  They now have a policy where all researchers who receive funding from them have to put the resulting publications into pubmed central online archive within 12 months of publication.  Access to these articles is free.  This is a good deal for those who do not live near a biomed library like UCLA who otherwise might have trouble obtaining journal articles like these.  Normally these articles can be purchased over the internet by interested parties, but the cost is often like $30 or more per article, which seems to me to be pretty steep just for a journal article.  This will help disseminate information to those persons who are interested in autism and the research findings of those who receive funding for research from autism speaks.  Autism speaks says they are the first nonprofit organization to implement such a policy.  these articles are available at www.pubmedcentral.gov for those who are interested in these forthcoming articles as well as other free articles that are available. I wish everyone from the government on down (or up depending on your point of view) would institute this policy.  I live near UCLA so I can obtain a lot of these articles if need be.  Of course it is always a hassle to xerox them and it costs like 15 cents per page at UCLA and you have to purchase this card to use in the machines.   Due to my perceptual motor problems, I sometimes have trouble lining up the pages properly and it takes several attempts for me to xerox some of the article pages and get everything on the page. UCLA used to have the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders on their shelf in the biomed library which I would browse on a regular basis.  At one time, this publication came out four times a year.  Due to the increased interest in autism research, the JADD now publishes something like eight times a year.  UCLA no longer seems to have it on their shelves and this is a disappointment to me.  My disability and other commitments make it hard for me to keep up with as much research as I would like to keep up with.  Hopefully someday that will change and I will have more juicy tidbits to add to this blog.  I think now UCLA has JADD and some other journals available online and maybe some day i will investigate and become a more regular reader of JADD and then some of the other journal articles. Though admittedly autism speaks is a less than perfect organization, I applaud them for instituting this policy.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/press/free_access_to_research_findings.php", "http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/11/autism-speaks-ensures-journal-articles.html", "title": "\nautism speaks ensures journal articles of research they fund are available\n"},
{"date": " October 29, 2008", "body": "\nI was very interested to read the following excerpt from an email that I received from the Florida chapter of autism speaks:                                   Walk Team News Congratulations to David McKibbin (a young man with ASD) for starting the first Palm Beach County Student Club for Autism Speaks at Bak Middle School of the Arts. Recently we spent a day at the school talking to students about autism and how student involvement can change the lives of everyone at the school.  Meet David at the Kick-off Luncheon on December 3.  The Bak Student Club for Autism Speaks has already started their fund raising efforts by selling candy during lunch. We want to spotlight you and your team fund raising efforts!  Send your fund raising story to palmbeach@autismspeaks.org  and see it in an upcoming email blast.So it would seem that contrary to what some persons in the neurodiversity movement believe there are some persons with autism who do support what autism speaks does and their research.  These proponents of neurodiversity give persons the misguided idea that the vast majority of persons on the autistic spectrum think exactly as they do.  Though some of the criticisms that certain people make about autism speaks may possibly be justified, such as the fact they are like a big corporate entity that spends money on salaries, jets and other frills that could be going to autism research, they are a good organization in some respects in that they fund research that will hopefully someday lead to a cure for this dreaded disease or if that is not possible at least prevention.  Prevention, not abortion, meaning that the person will have a shot at a better life.  This is yet another example where neurodiversity is mistaken about at least some autistic persons not wanting a cure. Some of them may claim that as a middle school student, David Mckibbin may be too young to know any better and may have been fed propaganda or been indoctrinated by his parents.  However, one must remember 14-year-old Kelly Beck who made the nasty website NT speaks and when autism speaks threatened legal action she was forced to close it down.  In fact, she did not even want her parents to know about it as I recall. Hopefully, to the chagrin of the ND movement, there will be more student clubs like this and more and more autistics who have the good sense to promote research leading to curation and prevention.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["mailto:palmbeach@autismspeaks.org"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/10/autistic-middle-school-student-starts.html", "title": "\nautistic middle school student starts school club for autism speaks\n"},
{"date": " November 22, 2008", "body": "\nOne of the ongoing activities that autism advocates (people trying to fight for certain perceived benefits for autistic people not michelle dawson's rather ironic use of the term) have been engaged in as of late is seeking insurance coverage for various treatments that are related to autism.  These include ABA, speech therapy and occupational therapy.  One of the impetuses for these treatments is that even though under the IDEA parents of autistic children are in a position to obtain these treatments at the expense of local school districts, the options are not always tenable.  School districts, for obvious reasons are often recalcitrant about paying for these treatments and in special ed law, as in other areas of law, the statement \"free and appropriate\" education is open to interpretation. One of the problems with pursuing legal recourse against school districts is the landmark supreme court decision in the Rowley case in which it was determined that appropriate did not necessarily mean best.  There are certain parents who don't understand this concept.  One of the more prominent of these is blogger Kristina Chew of the autismvox blog.  She has consistently stated how she believes that she is entitled to the best educational opportunities for her son at taxpayer expense, even though the supreme court has nixed this option.  Sometimes special education lawyers advise the parents whom they represent to never use the word \"best\" when asking for services from the school districts for their children.  This might make it hard for a parent, for example, to receive 40 hours a week of ABA for their child, because less hours might be deemed appropriate.  Then when the coin flip probability of complete normalcy that has been promised with this treatment is not obtained for the child by the time they are 7 years old, then the behaviorist excuse of not enough hours can be employed.  Also this is not to mention the problem of costly law suits and having to pay an attorney thousands of dollars up front in some instances for the dream of normalcy and the child becoming a productive member of society not having to live in the dole as an adult and being able to function in society.  Nor to mention the conflicts the parents have to go through with the school district and the work of having to have an IEP.  Often, it is the well-to-do that have these options available for them, having both the money and sophistication to employ legal counsel to pursue their agenda, and the less affluent being left out in the cold. One perceived way to circumvent this misery is for medical insurance to pay for these treatments instead.  There would be no IEPs, no costly attorneys (or at least in less instances).  All the parent with medical insurance has to do is file a claim with the insurance company and come up with a percentage co-payment.  If they belong to an HMO such as kaiser permanente, they could have tens of thousands of dollars in ABA therapy paid for nearly in full. Autism speaks and other organizations have made a push to have coverage for autistic children.  There have been pushes in Virginia, south Carolina and Pennsylvania for at least limited insurance coverage for these treatments for autistic children, that until very recently insurance companies would not pay for because the treatments were either considered experimental or educational rather than medical. As I have written in the past, the efficacy of ABA is dubious.  Even though Lovaas and his disciples such as Tristram Smith have been given top priority NIMH funding to study adult outcomes in the children in their famous 1987 study, they have yet to publish these though they have presented data informally at conferences claiming some sort of effective adult outcomes.  But still there is no evidence that children who undergo 40 hours a week of ABA will be able to be gainfully employed or be successful as adults. Ditto for speech therapy and occupational therapy.  I was a nonverbal autistic in the late 1950s who fully recovered my speech with the only intervention being psychoanalysis.  Even if an autistic child who undergoes speech therapy recovers their speech this does not necessarily mean there was a causal relationship between the speech therapy and the child talking by the time they are five years old so the financing of these treatments via insurance may not accomplish much. What is most worrisome of all to me is that autism may be considered a pre-existing condition by insurance companies and HMO's such as Kaiser who often cherry pick patients based on lack of pre-existing conditions.  Until recently autism would not be considered a pre-existing condition.  A parent who wants to get medical insurance for their autistic child to treat conditions not related to their autism would not have a problem getting the insurance.  But what if this insurance legislation is passed in a lot of states.  What if the cap on treatments becomes higher than $50,000 after even more intensive lobbying by autism speaks and other advocacy organizations?  Does this mean that Kaiser and other HMOs will start excluding families from coverage due to having an autistic child?  Does this mean that if an autistic child gets leukemia, Crohn's disease or needs orthopedic surgery of some sort they will not be able to receive treatment? The answer would seem to me to be yes.  Would this mean that parents of the children would be excluded from medical coverage as well.  This might mean that if the parent had a treatable medical condition they might not be able to get insurance because of their child's pre-existing  condition of autism. For this reason it seems that this insurance lobbying is not only more tears of toasted snow being cried by the parents of the children but also could provide great harm if the children are not able to have medical treatment that they need that is unrelated to their autism if they need for it to be covered by insurance.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/11/insurance-coverage-salvation-or-harm.html", "title": "\nInsurance coverage: salvation or harm for autistics?\n"},
{"date": " December 6, 2008", "body": "\nI have just finished reading the book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. He is a writer who often writes for the New Yorker and he has a rather interesting perspective on success. In his book, he states that success is not necessarily due to innate talents or gifts but rather to both effort and serendipitous opportunity. Neurodiversity proponent Frank Klein once said that autism equals genius and greatness.  I would link to Klein's webpage for all those neurodiversity doubting thomases, but his web page seems to have been taken down some time ago.  Thomas Edison said that genius was 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration. Gladwell in large part espouses the latter view. He demonstrates in his book how usually to achieve a great level of proficiency in any given area approximately 10,000 hours of practice is needed. This is in any field of endeavor, including computer programming, fiction writing, basketball playing, etc. This equates to 3 hours of practice a day for 7 days a week for ten years. As some people know, I have written An essay in which I question the autism of Bill Gates and other people.  Some persons in the autism community seem to believe that Bill Gates is autistic. I wrote a variety of facts about Gates.  Gladwell presented some more interesting facts.  When Gates was in the seventh grade, his parents enrolled him in Lakeside School, a very Tony private school in the Seattle area.  The parents of the school's students raised enough money to buy a computer terminal at the school.  The students at Gates' school started a computer club.  This was in the late 1960s during which time very few schools, including universities, had computer clubs yet Bill Gates got to join one at age 13.    Time sharing computers were a very new thing and at this age Gates got a jump on just about everyone else.  Another parent at Gates school worked at the school had a firm that sold time sharing to companies and was able to get Gates and other students at the school free computer time in exchange for testing software.  Gates become obsessed with this machine and would often spend as much as thirty hours a week working on the computer.  Gates mother wondered why it was hard for Gates to get up in the morning.  In my essay I wrote about Jactatio Capitus, a neurologic condition in which people rock in a manner reminiscent of autistic people, yet it does not impair their functioning the way autism does.  It is often caused or exacerbated by sleep deprivation.  Then someone who knew Bill Gates got a call from TRW asking for people who had experience programming the type of main frame that he was working on at the time,  The supply for such people in those days was short as luck would have it.  With the consent of the Lakeside school Gates was able to pursue an independent study program as an adolescent working for TRW on this computer.  All of these extraordinary opportunities which would not conceivably be available to more than a handful of people in the entire world in those days gave Bill Gates gobs of free time to practice computer programming and get in the 10,000 hours that Gladwell writes about.  Although Gates undoubtedly has some intelligence and talent, serendipitous opportunites quite clearly played a role in Gates being able to acquire computer skills.  Gates conceded in an interview with Gladwell that if there were even 50 teenagers in the entire world who had the opportunity to gain the type of training and experience that was offered to him he would have been surprised. No one can really dispute that at least in large part extraordinary luck played a part in Gates' acquiring the knowledge that he did.  Not to mention the fact that he was able to make friends with Paul Allen who also attended the Lakewood school and also acquire the same type of knowledge that Gates did.  As my psychoanalyst used to say, \"two heads are better than one\" so that was all the more strength for the fledgling microsoft when Allen helped Gates with the new startup in the mid 1970s. To those who claim that Gates is autistic and that his success proves that autistic people can succeed, I saw, read Gladwell and look at these facts.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/undiagnosing.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/12/more-interesting-stuff-about-bill-gates.html", "title": "\nmore interesting stuff about Bill Gates\n"},

{"date": " December 14, 2008", "body": "\nAs many people with more than a cursory interest in autism know, autism speaks has recently appointed two new members to their board of directors.  If I remember correctly, one of these two board members is the parent of an autistic child.  Neither of these two board members is autistic themselves.  This has generated some controversy in the autism blogosphere as it asks the interesting question of why autism speaks has never had an autistic board member. It is felt by some that they largely ignore the people they serve by not having one of those people on their board of directors.  Some of these people have answered the question themselves.  For example David Andrews has stated that it is because AS's goal is to eradicate autistic people.  Other people have given similar answers.  In what is a great irony, the neurodiversity movement, the main detractors of autism speaks, have complained about the name of this organization and states that it does not speak for autism.  Yet, these individuals with their omnescience, propose to get inside the heads of the AS leadership and speak for them without consulting to them personally about what the answer is to this question.  The controversy continues unabated.  Two bloggers who are parents of autistic children, Lisa Jo Rudy and Kristina Chew have posted this question on their blogs.  The latest to enter the fray is another parent of an autistic child and special education teacher and published author Mike Stanton, who asks, \"Will Autism speaks ever speak for us?\"  Apparently he is asking is there some way we can get neurodiversity members involved in autism speaks, take over their hard earned capital and use it for our own purposes which totally disagrees with AS.  These marriages of convenience do happen.  After all, Anna Nicole Smith had a billion reasons for marrying that oil tycoon who was 61 years her senior.  My friend from Norway, Ivar, (not Ivar Lovaas but an ND with the same first name) says that he posted something to autism's gadfly about how he felt money should not influence policy towards autism.  Apparently his post got lost somehow as I never saw it.   Well Ivar, if you read this, it is the sad truth.  In the United States, we do not have the socialist policies that Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Sweeden embrace  We have a capitalistic society here and those who manage to get on top, have power and can run the show.  That may or may not be fair but that is just the way it is. Though in the days when I was employed and had more money I donated money to CAN and NAAR on occasions before AS was created, I have never donated money to AS and probably would not for a variety of reasons even if I could afford to.  I have never worked for autism speaks and have no involvement with them.  I have no idea why none of their board members has autism but I realize it is an interesting question.  I am just curious about the motives of those who usually ask this question. In light of these facts I must ask the members of the neurodiversity crowd a question in response to their question about why there are no board members with autism at AS.  Why haven't any of you called autism speaks or emailed them and asked them why they have no members with autism on their board.  Perhaps they will give you an answer.  Why can't their side of the story be told? During the time when Zach Lassiter was claiming that AS was trying to prevent him from selling a t-shirt with a critical message about them emblazoned on it, I questioned the validity of the claim.  It seemed far fetched to me that a multimillion dollar charitable organization would take time to harass a small time t-shirt entrepeneur.  I called autism speaks and they referred me to a woman named Dana Marnand sp?? who is their communications director.  I was told that Zazzle who marketed Zach's t shirts felt that Zach was violating their terms of service and Zazzle unilaterally decided to discontinue Zach's t-shirt advertisement on their web site and autism speaks had nothing to do with it.  When I challenged the various members of ND who were using this as an excuse to bash autism speaks to prove me wrong they were not able to do so.  It turned out that neurodiversity's cause celebre of the month was completely bogus. I also emailed the research department at Autism Speaks, complaining about the fact that they fund the Lauren Mottron lab who employs Michelle Dawson, an anti-cure propagandist.  They responded that research grants were carefully reviewed.  Though I was not happy with their response they did give me a response and were polite and helpful. If the members of the ND movement who ask this question are really interested in an answer why don't they just contact AS and ask them and find out what their answer is for themselves.  Or maybe they don't want an answer to this question.  Maybe they just want to use this as an excuse to vent their anger.  Perhaps this is a thinly veiled marriage proposal, hoping that somehow they can acquire the millions of dollars of ready made capital so they can more easily pursue their own agenda.  If neither one of those scenarios are true why don't these people just ask AS why they have appointed no board members with autism.  I suspect they would get an answer of some sort.  Even if they don't it won't hurt to ask  What is the harm in asking?  Or maybe ND has some ulterior motive for asking this question on the internet without contacting autism speaks and getting their side of the story?\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/12/neurodiversity-members-should-contact.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity members should contact autism speaks about no asd board members\n"},
{"date": " December 10, 2008", "body": "\nLately, there has been some controversy concerning the fact that not a single person on the autism spectrum is on the board of autism speaks or has no position of power there.  Ordinarily I would agree that this is a legitimate beef.  It would be good if someone on the spectrum could add some input and I feel at least some persons on the spectrum (myself included at the risk of sounding arrogant) who are in favor of AS's stated goal of curing and preventing autism might make good candidates for board members.  Besides myself, some possible choices would be this lady who calls herself Droopy, who is nonverbal, but is very articulate using a keyboard.  Another good possible choice would be Tom Mckean.  Also Marty Murphy is another possible candidate. However Lisa Jo Rudy of the autism about blog seems to have some other persons in mind.  She suggests Temple Grandin, Stephen Shore, Ari Neeman, John Michael Carley and Michelle Dawson.  Not a single one of these five persons is in favor of curing autism yet for some reason that is beyond my comprehension Rudy seems to feel that these five should be considered for an organization who is in favor of curation and prevention when all of them have publicly stated they are adamantly opposed to this notion. Two of the five have asperger's rather than autism and would not even have been diagnosable as autistic during their childhood based on the diagnostic criteria that was extant during that time.  Shore already serves on the IACC for some strange reason I can't fathom when he is against a cure for autism yet the IACC was created out of the combating autism act which states curation and prevention are goals. Michelle Dawson, works in the laboratory of Laurent Mottron which receives funding from autism speaks in spite of the fact that in some of her writings she makes it quite plain how much she despises this organization, yet she continues to work in this lab and has not resigned in protest. Should members of the Ku Klux Klan be appointed to serve as board members of the NAACP.  How about if the DNC just to be fair puts five republicans on their board of directors, after all the fact that they are all democrats must be unfair to the republicans. It seems to me that most if not all of the people who complain about no autistics on the board of autism speaks are those with a neurodiversity agenda who are opposed to a cure and prevention and seem concerned that research funded by AS will someday lead to selective abortions of autistic fetuses. Could these people have an ulterior motive for serving on this board.  It seems there is a pattern among at least some persons in the ND movement to attempt to hijack the capital of others who have worked hard to earn it.  Bob Wright worked very hard to acquire the capital for AS so his grandson might have a slim chance of a decent life that the ND people want to seem to deny his grandson in the unlikely event a cure or at least some other treatment from AS's scientific research were found in our lifetime.  Ditto for the persons who donated money to AS and organized the walks and walked so that their children and relatives could have a chance of a better life but have been called eugenecists by people who seem to think they should serve on their board.    Michelle Dawson has advocated that scientists who do not agree with the agenda of AS apply for research grants there.  Ari Neeman and others in the ASAN have urged persons to request things from the IACC which grew out of the combating autism act a law which they made very plain that they did not like and which they attempted to prevent congress from passing.  Yet they want to take advantage of this law they don't like. It is quite possible that the ND movement just wants to take over the large capital of AS, as they are a movement whose numbers are too small to raise sufficient capital to start their own organization and fund raising efforts. When I suggested that as a person on the spectrum who wants a cure for autism that I should be on the board and that if i were running the show the funding the lauren mottron lab receives from AS would be discontinued since they employ Michelle Dawson  this nasty neurodiversity hatemonger who calls themselves alyric who is apparently a pal of Dawson's berated me saying that what i was doing was malicious spite and made the nasty and abusive personal attack that my minder did not teach me any manners. I think it is likely that an AS board member who agreed with the cure philosophy who was autistic would be called a token autistic and a house autistic and would result in the ND anticure movement starting yet another internet war on top of all the others they seem to have a proclivity to start. Ms. Rudy's suggestions for board members clearly baffle me and I hope that if there is an AS board member on the spectrum  they will not be drawn from the ND crowd.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/12/lisa-jo-rudys-strange-choices-for.html", "title": "\nLisa Jo Rudy's strange choices for the autism speaks board\n"},
{"date": " December 16, 2008", "body": "\nI have just encountered a rather interesting article about temple Grandin online.   It would seem that perhaps Grandin has spent a tad too much time at her livestock job once again and is recycling the waste products that the denizens of her slaughter houses produce.  Grandin makes the unsubstantiated claim that reported cases of severe autism have gone up while the higher functioning cases and Asperger's have been stable.  The 2003 California report produced by the state regional center seems to contradict that fact.  They have found great increases in the reported IQs on average of their clients, suggesting that perhaps the reported rise in autism cases is at least partly due to greater awareness that people of normal and above average intelligence can have autism.  She then goes on to say that it is the quirky and odd children who get tormented by school bullies but not the overtly handicapped children.  Apparently she never went to the schools I went to, where as an overtly handicapped autistic child I was severely tormented.  The article reports that Temple speaks from personal experience as she was diagnosed with Asperger's.  This is in spite of the fact that what mainly differentiates Asperger's from high functioning autism is the fact there is no speech delay in the former but there is in the latter.  The article goes on to state that Temple had a speech delay and could not talk until she was 3.  I don't know if Grandin told the reporter that she was diagnosed as asperger's or whether this is misreporting and/or ignorance on the reporter's part. Next Grandin is quoted as saying that \"everyone with autism is detail oriented\" as if she knows every single autistic person.  Stereotypes  like the ones she used to make about all autistics being visual thinkers are common for her.  She seems to think all autistics fall into her unique mode of being when she has only met a fraction of all of the autistics in the world.   Grandin once more goes into her tired cliches of channeling obsessions into careers, saying if a kid wants to draw trains let him do so as it might lead to a career in graphic design or a career in the railroad industry.  It is such juicy irony that she would pick the railroad industry after all the mishaps of Darius McCollum who was obsessed with trains and became an expert on the New York Transit system after befriending some of the people who worked there during his childhood.  Instead of a job as a train driver, McCollum has spent a good portion of his life cooling his heels in prison for taking trains for joyrides due to his obsession.  Grandin then pulls a rabbit out of neurodiversity's hat, claiming that kids who have the potential to be computer programmers end up being dishwashers because society tells them they can't do it. Grandin goes on to say that the problems of autistic children could be mitigated in school if all school children were forced to wear uniforms, then the autistic people who don't wear fashionable clothes would have an easier time of things.  She claims that in some countries such as the Phillipines she has seen first hand how school uniforms help autistic children.  Welcome to the military! thanks Temperamental.  I wonder how American school children who would certainly be culturally different than children in third world nations would feel about this.  What if they found out they were forced to wear uniforms because of autistic children.  I can't help thinking the retribution that would take place against autistic children in schools would make the bullying they currently have to endure look like a love fest. Grandin then continues to branch out her expertise from livestock facility design into the economic state of the U.S. currently, talking about the recession and the bailout making the bizarre claim that the wall street bankers should have been engineers and how they failed to see the big picture. I believe that Grandin presents some dangerous propaganda with her simple quick fixes not only for autistic children but even the U.S. Economy. Recently an anonymous poster in another blog post i made commented on how the same autistics who can get the name recognition, e.g. temple, donna williams, stephen shore, lianne willey, etc. are constantly recycled (apparently in the same manner of the waste products of the cattle that Grandin works with).  Though I am an agnostic and practially an atheist I will say metaphorically, God protect us from recycled autistics like Temple.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thirteen.org/newsandpublicaffairs/encouraging-talent-in-kids-with-aspergers"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/12/more-cattle-manure-from-temple.html", "title": "\nMore cattle manure from Temple\n"},
{"date": " December 31, 2008", "body": "\nHello to all regular readers (counting on the fingers of one hand with the pinky amputated :)) of autism's gadfly. I would like to start off wishing my friends and foes alike in the autism blogosphere a happy and prosperous new year and hope everyone will have a fruitful 2009.Now that this is the last day of 2008, I would like to contemplate the year past. This has been a rather interesting year for yours truly. Autism's gadfly is almost one year old as I started this blog sometime in January 2008, though I don't recall the exact date, so in that regard 2008 was a unique year with a turning point for me. I blogged prior to this on Jonathan's Journals which was a page on my Jonathan's stories site . There was no commenting and it did not have the same look as blogger blogs so I decided to get a separate site for my blogging. Also, at the beginning of 2008 I wrote an article urging people to reject neurodiversity. This created some angry responses from those who believe in this (in my opinion) flawed philosophy. Soon after this, I moved my blogging here and have had interesting exchanges with these people since. This blog is rather unique in that unlike other blogs it does not preach to the choir in comments and gets mostly negative responses from neurodiversity people. Canadian blogger Harold Doherty, who, for good reason, shares the contempt that I have for the neurodiversity movement, gave my article a shout-out. He then wrote a piece later endorsing autism's gadfly. I appreciate this in light of the fact that he is a big booster of ABA and I have been somewhat critical of this approach to treating and educating children with autism. I think Harold was thankful for my perspective on the ND though as this movement really trivializes the very serious behavioral and cognitive impairments of his son connor. This goes for other parents as well. I have continued to write blog posts against neurodiversity in this blog. I have wanted to devote more time to other topics, but the outrageous behavior of so many in this movement has prompted me to write perhaps a bit more about them than I should. Then an article in New York magazine came out about this movement and I was given a brief mention and had a bit of my article quoted.  Kathleen Seidel has taken credit for my mention.  She also states that she told the author of this piece about John Best and Lenny Schaffer, two other neurodiversity detractors and they were mentioned in the article.  Though neurodiversity provides some aggravation for me, I will try not to worry about them too much.  I remember the Arab proverb the dogs may bark but the caravan moves on. 2008 has been a watershed year for me in another way in that this is the first year since 1979 that I have not attempted to work and make a living.  As some people who read my writings know, though I worked sporadically (probably working for longer periods than I was unemployed) from about September of 1979 to my last failed attempt in late June 2007. The problems in the workforce became so severe I was forced to retire.  I have not given up hope of maybe someday being able to work again, but it won't be easy especially in this economy. Another landmark of my 2008 was taking some courses in web design at santa monica college.  I took an introductory web class where we learned some frontpage and html.  Then I took another class in XHTML and I learned how to build some web pages by hand coding.  Tim Boucher who built my jonathans stories web page became too busy with his other projects to offer me the uncompensated technical assistance that he was so generous in doing for me over the years.  (thanks for your help, Tim, if you happen to read this).  I was plugging my novel in progress \"The School of Hard Knocks\" on the national radio show, studio 360, and Tim heard the show and built the page for me.  I then managed to learn enough about XHTML and FTPing documents to web pages that I can now post my own articles and links on my web page.  This may seem like a small accomplishment, but I am still grateful for it.  I also, last fall, took a course in scripting, part javascript and part asp.net with visualbasic.net.  I have not currently enrolled in any more courses but I might again at some point and hope to maybe learn more about web development and perhaps other things.I have shelved \"The school of hard knocks\".  The nonfiction book that I have written a first draft of and have worked on and off on has also been gathering mothballs.  However, one of the ten chapters, my article about Gates, Einstein and Jefferson, is on my jonathans-stories site which I don't think I need to link to and the interested reader can find.  I also have written some other excerpts from the book here on autism's gadfly and perhaps other places on my web site as well.  I have been working on a novel about an autistic poker player and some of his adventures on and off for a while and i am hoping with some research to do some more work on it at some point.My disability has made it quite difficult for me to apply myself and do the things I want to do, so though I can't help but having some hope (as irrational as that may be) the prognosis for the future may not be good and I can't help being a bit depressed. Though 2008 was a bad year in some respects, it was a relatively good year(as good as I could have) in some others.  I am going to look forward to 2009 and perhaps I can see if perhaps I can't have some interesting adventures with this blog, in other writings and perhaps even some web related stuff and maybe some other matters as well.  At the end of Gone with the Wind Scarlet O'hara said tomorrow will be another day.  Well I suppose tomorrow will be another year and perhaps I can make some progress.  Again, a happy new year to all.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/neurodiv.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/12/gadflys-new-years-ramblings.html", "title": "\nGadfly's new years ramblings\n"},
{"date": " January 7, 2009", "body": "\nWell I see pop psychology icon Simon Baron-Cohen is at it again. In a recent article He states his concern about the development of a prenatal test for autism, claiming that it is not very far off in the distant future and claiming there is some relationship between math skills and autism and that if we had a prenatal test and autistic fetuses were aborted we might be depriving the world of math skills or certain gifts. Previously I wrote about SB's nonsense in my essay about autism genetics and whether my suffering is necessary to society. In this piece he states that there is an increased incidence among autistics in the relatives of mathematicians than in the general population.  I know that Baron-Cohen did some sort of study about autism being more prevalent in the family of engineers than in the general population but I am not aware of any empirical evidence that included mathematicians that he has produced.  Interestingly enough my father is an engineer.  However, on my mother's side of the family there is a family history of depression ADHD and possibly other things connected to autism.  Also, my mother feels that her uncle was probably autistic based on his family history, though a child born prior to 1900 would not have had a diagnosis, so it is very possible at least some of the genes for my autism may come from mom's side of the family. Also, I wonder about physicists which is a profession somewhat related to mathematics, computers and engineering in terms of aptitude.  If Baron-Cohen's reasoning is true, then physicists must also be included under this rubric.  I wonder how SBC would explain the fact that my brother-in-law is a Ph.D. physicist, his father is a physicist as his his younger brother.  I am fairly certain there is no family history of autism in my brother-in-law's family and thankfully neither of my nephews has autism.  SBC certainly has some explaining to do in this regard if he feels that preserving autism is necessary to society because of these genes. Further, Baron-Cohen, does not explain the fact that in the majority of cases autism is a disorder involving multiplex genetic etiology, the interaction of many different genes on may different chromosomes being associated with autism.  Most of these genes are autosomal, i.e. not the X or Y sex genes.  Autism is also X-linked for example Fragile X may account for like 5% of all cases of diagnosed autism.  Also one must consider based on the fact that the concordance rate for autism is not 100% in identical twins as well as the fact that the concordance is higher in fraternal twins than in siblings who share exactly the same genetic makeup that there must be something else operating other than genetics in the etiology of autism.  It is true we have a prenatal test for Down's syndrome which involves an abnormality of one chromosome but due to the fact that autism is not exclusively genetic, involves many different types of genotypes producing a similar though maybe not an entirely identical phenotype it is not an apt comparison.  Therefore, I really question his five year timeline that he presents in the article. It is possible that at some point in time a prenatal test will be developed for Fragile X before other types of genetic disorders that could cause autism.  But considering the severity of most persons with Fragile X, if Fragile X fetuses are aborted, would this be aborting math skills?  Again, there is no basis for SB's reasoning. From my correspondence with autism researcher Matthew Belmonte, who at one time was a postdoctoral fellow working in SBC's lab, I think Baron-Cohen has read my essay in which I questioned the premises that he makes about genetics as well as Temple Grandin.  I did not seem to change his mind. Interestingly enough, Matthew Belmonte also got a grant from CAN while working in this lab.  In one correspondence I had with SBC he seemed to think that some persons with autism should be cured if their autism was severe enough and he said that he supported CAN and their research funding. As many people know, SBC has also written an essay questioning whether or not high functioning autism is really a disability.  He consulted with alleged autistic David Andrews on this essay and others whose functioning level would be much greater than mine.  I resent SBC claiming that what I have is not necessarily a disability.  If he had an autism spectrum disorder that is as severe as mine is, he never would have been able to get married, go to graduate school, get his doctorate or write or publish his books or have a platform for the exposure of his warped and uninformed opinions.To sum up, it seems quite improbable that there will be a post-natal test that can reliably tell whether or not a person will become autistic anytime in the foreseeable future.  It is most likely many decades off.  Also, for the reasons I have given above it is unlikely it would affect math skills or any other positive traits, even in the unlikely event that even a portion of most types of autism could be detected in utero.I am sick and tired of SB's BS but I suspect I will have to hear more of it in the future, but hopefully someday I can apply myself better and find as good factual information as possible to dispute it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7736196.stm", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/01/more-of-sbs-bs.html", "title": "\nMore of SB's BS\n"},

{"date": " January 9, 2009", "body": "\nA recent study that has just been published by Dr. Irva Hertz-Piccioto is making headlines in the media and is getting a fair amount of coverage in the autism blogosphere. It is another attempt by the MIND institute to show that the increases in autism admissions to the state of California regional centers are not due to increased awareness, loosening of diagnostic criteria or people immigrating to the state of California to get their superior autism services. It is not so dissimilar to the study that her colleague Bob Byrd came out with several years ago. I must concede I have not read the study, which just came out in a journal called Epidemiology recently so perhaps I can't totally comment on the design of the study. However it appears that neurologist Stephen Novella has read this study and is commenting on it in his blog.Though Dr. Hertz-Piccioto has stated to the media that it is time to start looking for something in the environment, she does not appear to use the word environment in the actual study itself. She apparently uses the word artifacts. What artifacts might these be? Since Dr. Hertz-Piccioto is a professional epidemiologist, if there has been an increase in something in the environment that took place starting in the late 1980s to the present, then I suggest she look for it, study it, show how it relates to autism and publish it in a peer reviewed journal. Some of the candidates that she mentions to the media are pesticides and heavy metals. Both of those seem farfetched to me, since most of the biggest increases in the California prevalence numbers have come from urban areas rather than rural areas. It seems more likely that exposure to pesticides would be a problem in rural areas, so if anything it would seem there is a negative correlation between autism increases and pesticides. Also in light of Margaret Bauman's published study on the differences in the type of symptoms and neurologic brain impairments between autism and mercury poisoning as well as other heavy metals this seems to be farfetched also. The CHARGE study and the MARBLES study have been going on in California for many years. As far as I know they have not isolated anything in the environment that is shown to be associated with autism increases.One of the people who founded the MIND institute almost entirely on the state of California Taxpayer's dime is Rick Rollens. This is a man who insists that his son, an extremely low functioning autistic, was somehow poisoned by vaccines and has a known association and friendship with SAFEMINDS and possibly other vaccine groups. Also the head of the MIND institute Robert Hedron, when I heard him speak at the ASA national convention in Florida last summer quoted the 1 in 10,000 prevalence of autism as a 1994 figure. Actually it only comes from one study done by Darrold Treffert that was published in 1970. I wrote about this in another gadfly post it would seem that it is possible the MIND institute is quite biased and has serious conflicts of interest in that at least one of the persons who helped create it has some sort of relationship with people who are litigating against vaccine companies on the premise that their children's autism were caused by vaccines. They are basing part of their evidence on a supposed temporal relationship between vaccines and a great increase in autism numbers. I do not know if Rick Rollens is one of the actual litigants, but he is mentioned in David Kirby's book evidence of harm as having an association with these people. I have met Mr. Rollens who angrily insisted that his son's autism was caused by vaccines. As a California taxpayer with autism, the MIND institute's studies and ready access to the media are troublesome to me.Perhaps there is another artifact that caused this great rise in autism numbers though, namely special education. Just as there were large increases in autism in the early 1990s when more vaccines were added to the mandatory schedule, the IDEA (formerly the education for all handicapped act) was passed and was amended including autism as a disability in 1991. Coincidence? Perhaps so, but one must keep in mind that there are several studies that now refute the autism vaccine connection. To the best of my knowledge there are no studies refuting changes in special education legislation, making it easier for those with an autism diagnosis to obtain services as being responsible for the rise in autism diagnoses. Also, the Shannon Carter decision by the supreme court in 1994 paved the way for taxpayer money being able to legally pay for uncredentialed personnel to work with autistic children. This decision was a precedence for the decision in the Malkowitz case which paved the way for uncredentialed people to administer Lovaas ABA.Though, as far as I know, as I said before, no studies refute the special education hypothesis, there is one peer reviewed publication by James Gurney in Minnesota suggesting a temporal relationship between changes in special education law both Minnesota state law and federal law and increases in autism prevalence in this state.Gurney's study, the lack of evidence for vaccines or any other environmental cause of autism prevalence increases, I feel, suggest that perhaps it is time that Hertz-Piccioto and other epidemiologists perhaps change their focus and look for this as at least a partially responsible culprit.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=454#more-454", "http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/157/7/622"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/01/dr-hertz-piccioto-perhaps-special.html", "title": "\nDr. Hertz-Piccioto: Perhaps special education is the artifact you are looking for\n"},
{"date": " January 11, 2009", "body": "\nOne of the tenets of the neurodiversity movement is that autism is not at all a disease or horrific handicap, but just an alternative form of brainwiring. Some members of the ND movement concede that autism is a disability. However, on closer scrutiny, it would seem that they differ between the medical model of disability versus the social model of disability. This implies that if only society would change and be more accepting of autistics and/or accommodate their unique way of being, they would not be failures or have poor outcomes.Until recently, any scientific evidence for this tenet of ND seemed to be saliently lacking. About a year and a half ago, some cognitive scientists in Canada published a study which suggests that intelligence in autism has been underestimated due to the fact they are given the wrong test, namely the Wechsler IQ test. Another test, the Raven\u2019s progressive matrices, they say, is a more valid test. Some autistics who did poorly on the Wechsler scored substantially higher, in some instances much higher, on the Raven\u2019s matrices. Two groups of autistics (one children\u2019s group and an adult group) were compared with two non-autistic control groups. It was found that the difference in the test scores of the controls between the Wechsler and on the Raven\u2019s was negligible.In my own particular case, I am not sure if I have ever taken the Raven\u2019s matrices or how well I would do on this test. The Wechsler is composed of two different tests, verbal and performance. Each of these two tests in turn is composed of six subtests which I have varying abilities in. I score above average on vocabulary, superior in general knowledge, arithmetic and a test of abstract reasoning called similarities. On the comprehension subtest which has to do with social skills I do not do as well. On some of the subtests of the performance test I score about average on a few others I score in the severely retarded range. Interestingly, one of the subtests I do poorly in is the block design test in which many autistics excel in. As part of my brain damage I have perceptual motor problems which impair my fine motor coordination, handwriting and ability to put together puzzles.The study, has one of neurodiversity/autism hub\u2019s own bloggers as the lead author, Michelle Dawson. The results of the study has prompted a few neurodiversity proponents to give this study a shout-out claiming that autistics are not really stupid or retarded (in the cases of autistics who score in the retarded range on certain tests of intelligence) .Autism Diva writes:So they test a \"retarded\" autistic using the wrong tests and then expect them to be retarded for the rest of their lives, shove them in the retarded bin and forget about them, not find their talents and use them so they can be \"successful\" in a different way. Alyric writes:One of the participants scored the bottom of the bottom on every test except for the Raven at which he excelled. No question this person was and is severely impaired absolutely no question about it. But what are we to do with the equally undeniable fact that this person also excelled on the premier test of fluid intelligence? There\u2019s a very big question mark, right there along with all the particularly autistic people, maybe people like you. Alyric then goes on to state that perhaps if the special ed system had the results of Dawson\u2019s findings, I would have been able to be mainstreamed as a child and that I should be grateful for Dawson\u2019s research because it could help people like me and possibly autistics could function normally or at least better in society based on Dawson\u2019s findings. Since my scores on the Wechsler are so different than those of Dawson\u2019s research subjects it shows that she (Alyric) does not understand my situation.Joseph writes: I can tell you for a fact that Michelle\u2019s work is being cited by parents in situations where the school system is underestimating the cognitive potential of autistic children. I won\u2019t give details but it is.The researchers themselves also give implications of their findings to the media:Lauren Mottron writes:If we label those children as below-normal in intelligence that is how they\u2019re treated. The challenge is to coax that spark into the kind of intelligence that manifests itself in practice.Dawson herself writes:I hope this paper will have the practical effect of making it less likely that autisics will be written off, as autistics are so routinely written off by autism advocates in Canada and elsewhere.Let us look at the aspects of the study itself: One of the questions is, are the subjects truly representative of autistics who might be classified as intellectually retarded? First off, Dawson excluded any autistic who had a known genetic problem and only included persons with idiopathic autism whose only diagnosis would be autism rather than asperger\u2019s. This means that persons with fragile X, tuberous sclerosis, etc. were excluded. This could mean as many as 10% of all persons diagnosed as autistic, most of whom might actually fall in that retarded range. Also, the group of autistic children is comprised of 35 males and 3 females- a 12 to 1 ratio. The adult group of 11 males and 2 females is a 6:1 ratio. The ratio of males to females in the general population of autistics is 4:1. As noted by Boyd in his critique of Lovaas (1987) sexual inequivalencies in autism research are relevant because there is research showing that female autistics as a group are often substantially more severely autistic than males. Therefore, it would appear that Dawson\u2019s sample excluded a substantial number of subjects who might be classified as low functioning.The composition of the control groups is also interesting. In the children it is mostly males. The adult control group consists entirely of males. The study says they were recruited from an advertisement in a local newspaper. I wonder if it is possible that this newspaper is Dr. Mottron\u2019s favorite French Canadian porno rag. If there is any reason for excluding females in one of the control groups and having very few in the others it is not given. Therefore, the comparisons between autistic subjects and controls is not representative of either group. as it is questionable how people picked at random from a newspaper ad would be exclusively males.The scores on the Wechsler are not reported in a traditional sense, i.e. below 70 being retarded above 100 being above average, but rather as percentiles. Individual scores are not given on the Wechsler IQ or any of the subtests. The autistic adult group on the average scored at about the 50th percentile on the Wecshler, so clearly as an average range they were not retarded at all, so applying the statements of the study to the adult group is certainly misleading. The group of autistic children\u2019s average percentile was 31st in the verbal portion of the Wechsler and 26th in the performance. When expressed as percentiles it would seem that this is a disparity between 50th percentile, but, as Dawson states herself in the study, this is in the low average range rather than a retarded average. The percentile in the verbal IQ this might mean an IQ in the low 90s on average as opposed to an average IQ of 100, so on average, this was clearly a higher functioning sample than one who would be composed of many members testing at a level of mental retardation. The stated average percentile of 31st is also misleading when looking at Dawson\u2019s graph of the average of the subtests in the verbal portion of the Wechsler. The Verbal Wechsler is composed of six subtests. For some reason Dawson either excluded the digit span test from the graph or it was not given to the subjects. On two of the other five subtests we see that the average score in the comprehension subtest is below 20th percentile and the vocabulary is also on the low side. Yet on the other three subtests, which measure academic skills, similarities, general knowledge and arithmetic, we see that the average percentile is around 40th, showing that as a group these autistics were nearly average in IQ if we just included the results of these tests. In the block design test, the average was 60th percentile with other subtests of the performance section of the Wechsler being substantially lower. I have mostly focused on the verbal section rather than the performance section because I feel it is more relevant for assessing the children\u2019s academic potential. Also the very low average on the comprehension test is relevant to this discussion but more about that later.When we look at Dawson\u2019s graph on figure 3 of the study we see that 10 of the 38 children scored 50 or more percentile points on the Raven\u2019s than on the Wechsler, only about 25%. Five of the 38 children had scores that were as high or higher on the Wechsler than on the Raven\u2019s matrices. The remaining 23 children scored higher on their Raven\u2019s percentile than the Wechsler, but in a number of cases it was only fractionally higher, e.g. 30th percentile as opposed to 25th percentile or 70th percentile as opposed to 65th percentile, showing no significant increase in intelligence in one test versus another. It is possible those children could have had a headache or not been feeling well the day they took the Wechsler, than on the day they took the Raven\u2019s and this could account for the small disparity in some of the cases.As I said before, even if Dawson wants to claim that the Raven\u2019s as a measure of fluid intelligence shows that autistics have the potential for good outcomes outside of negative societal constraints, she will have the explain the poor results on the comprehension subtest as it applies to society. The low average on this test indicates that these autistics would do poorly in social situations, not know what appropriate action to take in certain instances and would apply to them negatively in school and job and other situations. For this reason the results of the comprehension subtest in some aspects may be more valid an indicator of their functioning level than either the Raven\u2019s or Wechsler as a whole.Even assuming I am somehow mistaken and what I believe to be Dawson's questionable science is sound, the question is, how can the knowledge that autistics do well on tests of fluid intelligence be applied so that they can have better outcomes, how can the educational situation be modified so that the autistics will receive a better education with this knowledge that we have? As is typical, the neurodiversity movement fails miserably in addressing this issue.Neurodiversity seems fond of spreading stereotypes and urban legends about persons with autism that have no basis in reality. I believe their claim that the results of Dawson\u2019s research showing that autistic people who function at a retarded level have the potential to perform normally is one of them and yet another of the pieces of propaganda that they stoop to in order to promote their misguided agenda.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticIntelligence_PS_2007.pdf"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/01/michelle-dawsons-research-intelligent.html", "title": "\nMichelle Dawson's research: Intelligent Autistics or Neurodiversity Propaganda?\n"},
{"date": " January 26, 2009", "body": "\nI have been reading some stuff posted by Michelle Dawson on the leftbrain/rightbrain and on her TMOB board and I would like to offer some corrections and errors on my part that Michelle points out. First off I would like to change my statement in the post about whether or not Michelle's work has been replicated.  I am still not clear on whether or not Hayashi is a replication of Michelle's work or not.  I have to concede I only read the abstract.  I have not read the whole study.  Based on reading the abstract it would seem that this was not in fact a replication but a different kind of study.  I will have to read the entire study before making that definite determination.  I should have said so in my previous post, I did not, I regrettably made that error.  Michelle claims that I have misrepresented what the study is but she has not commented on whether or not Hayashi used the Wechsler as well as the Raven's.  I would like to say I should have phrased my post on this subject better, and conceded that reading the abstract is not the same as reading the study.  That is true as Michelle pointed out.  I will attempt to locate the entire study that Joseph referred me to and will write in this post whether or not I was wrong. Also, I apparently did not understand that the digit span test was not included in the newer edition of the Wechsler that Michelle used in her study.  The references I cited were dated and apparently the Wechsler had not been revised at that time, so that is the explanation for the digit span not being used.  I did not understand this, I apologize for that.  However, I would still be curious as to how the percentiles stack up if the older version of the WISC were used with the digit span as autistics have been shown to score high on this test so I believe it to be a relevant issue as if the older Wechsler were given and a comparison with the Raven's were made it might provide some more significant information.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/01/some-corrections-on-my-postings-about.html", "title": "\nSome corrections on my postings about Michelle Dawson\n"},
{"date": " January 20, 2009", "body": "\nWell it seems once again some hatemongers and dishonest people from the ND movement are using me as a punching bag to use the Freudian defense mechanism of displacement due to their own hatred of themselves. Out of the clear blue sky someone mentioned me as someone who is a collaborator and traitor of some sort and added the nice personal insult that I was somehow not clever enough to make money at what I was doing unlike someone else who the post was originally about, but this person who, i did not know about until the other day seems to be thoroughly intoxicated with hatred and bitterness:Totally agree with that, and suggest that the SECOND most notorious collaborator is Jonathon Mitchell, who fortunately, doesn't have the wit to make any money at selling out as MJC has.This person goes on with more of a barrage of insults and an outright lie:You're \"number two\" all right, a whole pile of it!The \"Quisling\" part comes in because he's best buds with JBJr and Doherty, and for his anti-autistic comments on LB/RB.AND, the mere fact that he's inept and ineffective doesn't take anything away from his status as a traitor. And then there is the topper of not only stooping to bringing my mother into the mix but stating something that is an outright deliberate lie and fabrication on his part:He admitted on his blog that he learned his attitude about autism being a \"horrible tragedy\" at his mother's knee, and refuses to consider any other point of view.Before going on with the rest of the blog post. Let me say this now, this is an outright lie on clay adam's part. I never admitted on my blog that I learned about autism being a horrible tragedy from my mother. This person who calls themselves Ivar one time asked about my mother and her attitudes. I sort of knew what he was leading up to and should have rejected this comment but I chose to take the moral high road and answer him telling him my mother was still alive and had a similar attitude about a cure that I did. Then Ivar made a comment which I rejected stating that I had learned this from my mother's knee. I never in any way shape or form said that I had learned any of this from my parents. Clay Adams is an out and out liar. But many in the ND movement are not above the fray of ethical or honest behavior it would seem. I learned to hate autism and wish for a cure, from having to suffer from years of rejection, years of having to be addicted to self-stimulatory behaviors and not being able to attend regular school or make a living or have any sort of a near normal life that many if not most of the neurodiversity proponents enjoy and take for granted and a multitude of other disabilities and problems that are too lengthy to mention in this already long post.Adams then goes on to imply that anyone who disagrees with the neurodiversity philosophy is not welcome to comment about it on another blog other than their own, engaging in the well known censorship that neurodiversity has seemed to advocate since its inception:Jon M. doesn't just stay on his blog, but takes it on the road to infest other people's blogs.Then, David Andrews, someone who says they are autistic and has a masters degree in educational psychology somehow weighs in on my character Andrews main claim to fame is helping to encourage Simon Baron Cohen write that absolutely inane article claiming that high functioning autism should not be considered a disability. Andrews also seems to enjoy engaging in abusive insults:I get the feeling that Jon Mitchell hasn't really learned much from his degree studies. Nor from life, really. Like... so he wanted to go into brain research but his autism has kept him from that? BOLLOCKS!Other people's reaction to the diagnosis, or his own behaviour (regardless of the autism), may have done. His unwillingness to learn, too. They fuck your chances of getting on pretty badly. Other people's prejudices are one of the biggest pbstacles for autistics or any other 'differents'. Pity he can't see that... I guess he didn't listen too well in his social psychology lectures.I in turn made the correct response that andrews just happened to decide he was autistic well into adulthood, never went to special schools, was able to get married and never had problems of the magnitude that I have had in my life so he can't possibly judge me, he responded with all of these great words of wisdom:Oh dear, Jonny boy, what an ignorant assuming piece of shit you really are, eh?\"David, it does not matter whether i listened in my social psych classes or not.\" Yes, it does. You'd know more about the influence of other people's prejudices and their effects on the everyday lives of those subjected to them. Dipshit.\"I am not an M.ED. pending or distinguished, but I have learned about autism from the inside out, the real world, unlike you, who just learned from books,\" Learned from real life, inside out. There sems to have been as suspicion of autism when I was younger, but not much was done about it. Very nearly ended up in a special school but - if you are a product of special education - I'm glad I didn't fucking go! LoL! I know more about autism than you'll ever fucking know, tosspot! LoL And yes, I was able to get married... not all that rare, actually! And I was diagnosed by two psychiatrists in the UK as an adult back in 1997. Get your fucking facts straight, and contend with being an idiot. My god... this is why you only have a Bachelor's degree.Now we know the REAL Jonathan Mitchell, don't we? Hates anyone on the spectrum who did a shitload better than he feels he did.Self-sorrowing arsehole.i think all you deserve is insults when you can't get your bloody facts right. and i can tell you now, you were way out of bloody line.pity you didn't learn to get your facts right when you did your degree. plus, on insults and abuse, you're nobody to talk.so STFU.no wonder you can't get work.it ends here, this does.One has to wonder about what \"latrine lips\" Andrews says about the suspicion of autism. Why wasn't anything done? Perhaps it was because his autism was nowhere nearly as severe as mine. If he never had to go to special ed schools, he was able to get married and have a daughter. He could not possibly know what life is like for a typical autistic person. He knows nothing about autism from the inside out. As far as my only getting a bachelors, then according to Andrews convoluted logic, then why was he only able to get a masters and not a doctorate. Something must be terribly wrong with him also. He has to personally attack me, the fact that I am currently unemployed and all of the other things and Clay Adams has to bring my mother into the mix and intentionally lie about what I said on my blog. Andrews parents certainly would have done something if his autism was significant enough to warrant a diagnosis when he was younger which he did not receive. Andrews by his own admission was not diagnosed until 1997 which would have been when he was over 30. So I stand by my statement that the problems of autistics are really an abstraction to him. Furthermore, as far as I can tell Andrews was diagnosed with asperger's not autism, whereas I had a speech delay as a child so his condition is really different from mine and the others who have autism.If I am as truly inept and ineffective as Clay Adams claims, then I wonder why I managed to get noticed by him and clearly get under his skin so much. Perhaps I have been effective and adept in putting at least one misguided member of the ND movement in their place who has to respond with such blatantly hostility and lies about what I said in my blog.I truly feel sorry for Clay Adams and David Andrews. I feel sorry for Andrews' daughter that she has a father who would stoop to such nastiness and obscene language. I feel sorry for any potential client/patient in Finland that Andrews would see.The entire exchange can be read hereI am thankful though, in my blogging to expose neurodiversity as the terrible philosophy that it is that these two individuals can allow us to judge the entire ND movement by the delightful company they keep.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2009/01/carley-fighting-autism.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/01/more-lies-and-hatred-from.html", "title": "\nmore lies and hatred from neurodiversity\n"},

The article is here Though I may have beaten this issue to death somewhat lately, I was interested to find out that this was not just a conference abstract but an article that was actually available online, and I have just read the entire article and found it interesting. Testing was done on a group of autistic children and children with other disorders as well as typical controls. The autistic group scored higher on the Raven's than on the Wechsler. However, the high scores were just specific to the lower functioning group (lower functioning being defined as having a full scale IQ of less than 85) who scored about 20 IQ points higher on the Raven's than on the Wechsler. There was no difference between the two tests in the group of higher functioning autistics. I won't comment further but I just thought that everyone who, like myself, has an interest in the work the Mottron lab has done on intelligence in the Ravens versus Wechsler might like to read this article.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.springerlink.com/content/5803h01478m6t560/fulltext.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/01/another-article-on-wechsler-and-ravens.html", "title": "\nAnother article on Wechsler and Raven's with autism\n"},
{"date": " February 6, 2009", "body": "\nToday I attended a rather interesting lecture by autism researcher Nancy Minshew. Dr. Minshew is a professor of psychiatry and neurology at the University of Pittsburgh and is one of the people currently doing research into the neurophysiology of autism. She talked about autism being \"synapseopathy\". I guess that might mean lack of connections between synapses. Also she talked about autism being a disconnection syndrome, various areas of the brain being disconnected from each other. What, of course, was most interesting about this idea was that she stated that it had implications for someday making good interventions a reality for autistic people. She stated that one of the most interesting questions to her about autism was the heterogeneity between autistic persons. She used the book about social skills co-written by Temple Grandin and Sean Barron as an example of this phenomena. She read the blurbs on the flap of the book, one from Grandin and one from Barron. She contrasted the differences between these two persons with autism. Temple had no emotion in her blurb, just approached social situations logically, whereas Sean was the opposite.She discussed the fact since autism seemed to result in a problem of migration of neurons to various places during fetal development that this suggested that the mercury/vaccines causes autism people were mistaken. She quoted a toxicologist who worked at the CDC who had an autistic son stating that he had studied this and the evidence of toxicological factors and this showed that autism was not caused by anything toxicological. She then gave Paul Offit's book a plug. She also plugged a book that has just come out by someone named Andrew Zimmerman, though I don't remember the name of the book or she never gave it.One interesting anecdote that she discussed was how rules could override concepts in autistic individuals. She talked of a story about an autistic boy who was an eagle scout trained in first aide who liked to ice skate. One day he went ice skating with his mother and then skated a bit too fast and knocked his mother over who became unconscious. Though the boy was trained in first aide, someone else ended up administering it to her and not her son. After she was administered the first aide and taken to the hospital the boy's mother inquired as to why he had not given her first aide since he was an Eagle scout and had been trained and given a first aide badge. His reply was, \"my first aide badge expired\".She talked about some studies of amygdala-cortical interactions.One interesting thing that she talked about was functioning in Broca's and Wernicke's areas in autistics versus normal controls. Broca's area is the part of the brain in the frontal lobe that is involved in expressive speech. Persons who have lesions in this area as adults become aphasic and are not able to speak. Wernicke's area is in the temporal lobe of the brain and it involves receptive language or the ability to understand language and adults with lesions in this area have trouble understanding language. Minshew talked about a study in which the autistic group had less activation in Broca's than the normal control group whereas they had more activation in Wernicke's area. These results are consistent with poorer comprehension of complex sentences yet good reading and spelling ability among autistics. What I found most interesting about this study is perhaps this could be the reason that autistics do not always develop expressive speech. Perhaps there is some dysfunction in Broca's area that is analogous to adult aphasics. This would contradict what Eric Courchesne told me years ago when I was his research subject in some MRI scans and event related potential studies. He claimed that studying Broca's area would probably not be fruitful in autistics as developmental lesions were different than adult lesions. When I first asked him about why if autistics have damaged cerebellums they have no obvious motor impairments this was along the lines of his explanation that because the damage to the cerebellum was early enough there were not the same types of motor impairments that took place when an adult had damage to the cerebellum.I don't remember much more about the lecture but overall a very interesting lecture.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/02/interesting-lecture-by-nancy-minshew.html", "title": "\nan interesting lecture by Nancy Minshew\n"},
{"date": " February 5, 2009", "body": "\nThe neurodiversity movement has consistently voiced their opposition to a cure for autism. One of the arguments that adults with autism or the parents of autistic children who believe in neurodiversity can make is that it is none of my business or anyone else's if they don't want to accept a cure. Or even though (and I concede the point) it is improbable a cure will be found in our lifetime, that anyone should want to change them or wish a desire to change them. Or an organization like autism speaks would just be a front for coming up for a way to find a test in order to deliberately abort autistic fetuses. Autism speaks is not really interested in funding work not related to finding a way to abort autistic fetuses such as the work of people like Jaime Pineda or Lindsay Oberman to study neurofeedback or mu wave suppression, that is only a front to cover up their desire and \"ultimate goal\" (ABFH's words) to find a way to abort those fetuses. They can argue \"It is our own body, it is our children's body it is our own life, our their lives what right do you have to tell us we need to change ourselves or our children?\"The problem with this logic is they are affecting other people. They are not only affecting autistic people, such as myself, who wish for a cure for autism or parents of autistic children who would like to change their children by curing them if possible, they are also affecting persons who are not autistic nor have autistic family members. How can that be? you ask. Well the answer is in tax dollars for autism services. No one can deny that autism imposes a heavy burden on the taxpayers, though this is something that the neurodiversity people do not like hearing, but it is an indisputable fact.Most germane of all, these examples apply to some of the proponents of the ND movement. One of the most well known examples of this is Amanda Baggs who has constantly advocated for neurodiversity, saying she does not wish a cure for her condition. Yet Ms. Baggs feels it is just fine to ask the taxpayers to subsidize her SSI checks and the section 8 public housing she receives in a subsidized apartment in Burlington, Vermont. Also, one must remember Frank Klein, whose website has been taken down. Klein would promote the idea that Einstein was autistic and claim that autism equaled genius and greatness. Yet he himself was not enough of a genius to be capable of maintaining any substantial and gainful employment and was living (and probably still is) on the dole.Another example, besides SSI and section 8 housing is adult medicaid waivers for autistic persons. Ari Neeman, president of autism self-advocacy Network, has become a very public figure in the autism self-advocacy movement in this past year. He has preached that autistics should not be cured, yet this involvement of his organization and obtaining these medicaid waivers for autistic people is one accomplishment he seems proud of. Never mind the cost to the taxpayers. When asked what should be done about autistic people who can't speak, self-mutilate themselves, smear feces on walls, etc, Neeman responded with the copout, being anti-cure does not mean being anti-progress.One of the most costly programs for autistic children is the IDEA which guarantees \"a free and appropriate education\" at taxpayer expense. We see that one parent of a moderate to severely autistic child, Kristina Chew has given this program a shout out. When the law was first enacted the federal government made a provision that they would pay a maximum of 40% of the costs to the local school districts. They have never paid nearly this amount. Ms. Chew states that she advocates the full 40% funding in the article to which I have linked. This would involve billions of dollars of taxpayer money.Yet, Ms. Chew appeared on national television stating that she had no desire to change her autistic child.   I remember reading that she drugs her son with dangerous anti-psychotic medications but still does not want to change him and feels that the taxpayers should pick up the tab at the cost of billions to society for the IDEA.The neurodiversity movement might argue in response to this, that because of societal attitudes and prejudice these taxpayers subsidies are necessary.  That they would not be necessary if society would change and autistics could function at a level that would not require them to need excess tax supports.  However, what is society to do about the nontalking, self-injurious behavior, meltdowns, lack of social relationships, motor coordination problems, and impaired ability to concentrate and to engage in goal related activity due to problems in executive functioning.  These have nothing to do with society.  The only thing they can come up with is Nee'man's copout.  This was their response to millions of television viewers. So, I say, this is not moral this is not right.  I do not believe that Baggs, Klein, Ne'eman and Chew have a right to these attitudes and to pontificate them while advocating, and in the case of the medicare waivers, bringing about, taxpayer provided services for people for being on the spectrum.  They are certainly hurting others with this attitude.  Persons who subsidize these programs certainly have a right to say they want cures for autism to be found.  I believe if these people really practice what they preach, they should stop asking for government handouts.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=29", "http://autism.change.org/blog/view/17_billion_for_special_education", "http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/Story?id=5033594&page=2"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/02/neurodiversity-we-dont-want-to-change.html", "title": "\nneurodiversity: We don't want to change but we want your Tax $$$\n"},
{"date": " February 17, 2009", "body": "\nEarlier today I was reading a post about vocational rehabilitation services by Dora Raymaker who blogs for change.org along with Kristina Chew. This reminded me of my own lousy experiences with the California State Department of Vocational Rehabilitation. In 1985 I was unemployed, not skilled in anything except being able to type very rapidly.  Due to my severe fine motor coordination problems that made handwriting and printing very difficult for me, I learned how to type at a fairly young age, so I had that skill.  My terminations from jobs were starting to pile up, though I still did not yet qualify for the Guiness Book of Records as I do now.  I felt that I was at the end of the line, I would have no choice but to get a job for a handicapped person.  My mother called the Los Angeles chapter of the Autism Society of America to ask for their advice.  In those days, autistics as high functioning as myself were still considered quite an anomaly, so they said that they really had no programs to help someone whose autism was as mild as mine.  They suggested the California State Department of Rehabilitation.  I had the requisite evaluations by a primary care physician and a psychiatrist to qualify for the services.  I met with a voc rehab counselor who suggested I learn word processing and medical transcription due to my ability to type.  In those days, word processing was still considered sort of a novelty and had not even quite made typewriters obsolete yet.  Word star was the DOS based software of choice and sort of the hot ticket program.  Word perfect may have been in its infancy (version 5.1 had still not been written) and not as popular as it became later.  Microsoft had not yet written Word. They sent me to a school that was part of the local school district of a middle sized town which is a  city in the Los Angeles area.  This was an adult program.  They also provided the funding for a separate word processing class, so that I would be attending this office skills school for part of the day to learn office skills and medical transcription.  When I was met by the person who ran the school, she stated that she felt I was not ready to learn word processing and informed my rehab counselor of this.  My rehab counselor solely based on her recommendation immediately discontinued the funding for my word processing class that the state had set aside.  They put me in another much cheaper word processing class that the school had to offer.  The voc rehab counselor claimed that it was the same as the more expensive class but the teacher would give more attention to the students.  Also, the class met in the late afternoon, so basically I would be going to this school, the entire day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  The word processing class was done on these cheap crummy Apple IIE computers (not on a DOS based computer) and the word processing packages that we were to learn were these very obscure programs that had been written only to run on an Apple IIE and were not word star or one of the other marketable stand alone word processing packages that were in use in the mid 1980s and which in those days were in huge demand by employers due to the short supply of persons who were familiar with the packages.  Word star would be taught as part of the class later, but it turned out we were expected to learn this on our own and the teacher did not even know word star!  This was so crazy that I asked my rehab counselor if I could drop the class and he acknowledged it was my option.  I ended up paying about $400 for a private word star class out of my own pocket. It gets even worse with the office skills medical transcription part of the course which I did not drop.  After learning some rudimentary office skills, they gave me these medical transcription exercises with a limited workbook which was published in 1967 and was nearly 20 years obsolete.  I found out later that medical transcription terminology changes all the time.  I was expected to learn everything on my own.  I did the exercises out of the book during the class with the teacher not giving me any assistance.  She knew nothing about medical transcription yet was paid by this city's school district and got money from the State of California voc rehab department to teach this class.  She deliberately avoided correcting my exercises.  After I finally finished the exercises in the book, she told me that she knew of an opportunity where I could do an internship in a hospital, but I would have to wait to get a certificate.  She stated that I was unable to get my certificate as I had not done the exercises correctly.  I then complained to my rehab counselor and got her to start correcting some exercises. But this class was so awful the teacher was so awful, I applied for jobs on my own and found someone who was willing to give me training in medical transcription based on what little I had learned in this course.  I was paid on production and my earnings came out to about $1.50 an hour when I was first working for this person in 1986.  I was fired from some medical transcription jobs doing hospital medical transcription the most difficult type of transcriptions, but then finally got some jobs doing clinic based and workers' comp reports which were easier to do but still required knowledge of medical terminology.  I was able to work for various places for indefinite periods of time.  I finally got a job doing most kinds of hospital reports as an independent contractor and made a semi-decent living for a brief period of time.  When that job ended I had other problems and was forced to retire in my early 50s as I have written before.When I was still doing medical transcription (albeit as not a great transcriptionist) I thought about what Temple Grandin said about Medical transcription being an unsuitable profession for a person on the spectrum.  She based this assessment on just one other person (whom I was acquainted with also) who had failed in her endeavor to become an autistic medical transcriptionist due to sound sensitivity issues.  I felt a certain satisfaction in having proved Grandin wrong.  When I stopped doing medical transcription, however, I never dreamed I would end up meeting Temple in person at the 2008 ASA conference in Orlando, Florida and tell her what had happened to me and Temple again repeating what she said in her writings about the unsuitability of transcription as an occupation for a person on the spectrum.  Well, I suppose life does have its little ironies. I still think of this bad experience I had with vocational rehabilitation.  I will never know whether or not this internship in the hospital was on the level or if the teacher was lying to me.  I suspect the latter though.  Though I was able to work in medical transcription sporadically in spite of the way voc rehab treated me, I was never good enough in it to steadily keep jobs or continue working in it, as the field changed. Some persons whom I met have suggested that I give them another try.  They say that it was over 20 years ago, that they may have changed and turned over a new leaf and may give decent classes, but I don't think so.  I still remember the old saw once bitten twice shy.  Most other persons whom I have spoken with who went to California's department of rehabilitation concurred with me and did not feel they were helpful and would only recommend it to their worst enemies.  Perhaps some persons may have or may have had better experiences with them than I did, but I still don't recommend them and I am as skeptical about voc rehab programs being another quick fix that is promoted for autism.  All I can say is let the disabled consumer beware.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.change.org/blog/view/money_alone_is_not_enough_for_successful_services"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/02/voc-rehab-let-disabled-consumer-beware.html", "title": "\nVoc Rehab: Let the disabled consumer beware\n"},

{"date": " December 22, 2008", "body": "\nCalifornia is the golden state, Florida the sunshine state and Texas the Lone star state, New Jersey is the Garden State. Perhaps New Jersey should change its name from the Garden State to the special education largess state. It would appear that this state has a pretty excessive amount of spending on the education, speech therapy, etc. of children with autism, according to an article in today's new york times . The article states that the costs of educating an autistic child range from $30,000 to $150,000 a year with the cost of educating a typical child in New Jersey approximately $10,000 a year. The costs of educating an autistic child in New Jersey are even more expensive than educating children with other disabilities such as mental retardation without autism. Half of autistic children receive out of district placements whereas about 22% with mental retardation are placed out of district. The out of district placements are far more expensive. The students often receive expensive speech and occupational therapy costing from $65 to $90/hour.Some school districts that have enough classified students to have their own programs end up attracting more autistic students such as the Cherry Hill school district in South Jersey. \"When Districts have good programs they become magnets\" Charles Lange, director of special services, for the Cherry Hill district, was quoted as saying in the article.The article quotes the costs of educating one severely autistic child as $200,000 a year placement in a residential school.The 1 in 150 prevalence figure that is oftcited for autism comes from the study that the CDC did two years ago. They studied several states and this figure was not universal for each state but was an average of several states with Alabama being well below the average and New Jersey being well above the average of 1 in 150 in autism prevalence.Those who believe there has been a real autism increase due to some environmental factor cite the differences in pollutants between alabama and new jersey as the cause but provide no real evidence. As far as I know, no one has shown that vaccination rates are higher in New Jersey than in other states.Those who may not believe the increase is real would argue that perhaps due to services or more money being spent on special education students in New Jersey, that the state is attractive to those out of state who will move to New Jersey seeking services. The findings of the CDC study argued against this showing that the majority of children with autism in New Jersey were born in the state.However, the CDC study does not control for differences in service level of various school districts within the state and persons within the state moving to another district and obtaining a coveted autism diagnosis due to the huge amount of money  some school districts in this state are willing to spend on special education students. Perhaps, this largess is an explanation for the high prevalence of autism in New Jersey.One must question what all of this spending on special education accomplishes. As I have written before there are no adult outcomes published from the children who supposedly achieved normal functioning in Lovaas (1987). What good does speech therapy and occupational therapy do? How do these children fare as adults? As far as I know, there are no employment figures showing reduced unemployment among autistics or a casual relationship or even a correlation between special education spending, early intervention and improved outcomes of autistic children. Various researchers such as Peter Szatzmari and Eaves and Ho have shown that in some cases autistic children end up having very good outcomes regardless of what intervention is done. If someone improved while getting  special education services there may not even be a casual relationship.   One also must remember the questionable cost-benefit analyses of Jacobsen et al based on Lovaas 1987, which erroneously assumes that interest rates and the rate of inflation will remain stable for decades. Also, the cost-benefit analyses don't take into consideration that punishments such as hitting children and electric shocks were the effective ingredient in Lovaas (1987)  In states such as California, where I live, aversives have been outlawed, so the findings of Lovaas 1987 would not be applicable to the type of ABA these states would do without aversives. Regular readers of autism's gadfly will also recall that I wrote a piece about half of special ed students failing the high school exit exam .Also, an article appeared in the atlantic journal constitution some years ago by Andrew Mollison (sorry could not find it online or would link it but did read it when it came out in 2002) Showed that since the inception of the IDEA that disabled students were failing to make overall gains in test scores and that almost a third of them ended up as high school drop outs.  Mollison further reported that only 28% of states reported average scores of the disabled children improved in any way.   The then time assistant secretary of the u.s. department of education, Robert Pasternack, stated that the longer the amount of time a student spent in special ed, the bigger the gap in test scores between them and the regular ed. students. Given the above facts one has to wonder whether all of the money the state of New Jersey spends on special ed is money well spent.  One also wonders if New Jersey is not a haven for special educators, speech therapists, etc. looking for a quick buck at the expense of children diagnosed as autistic and whether this diagnosis does indeed follow the dollar sign in New Jersey.    Perhaps this huge spending on special education that the state of New Jersey engages in are part of special education being one of the great autism ripoffs, that I hope to write about someday in Autism's gadfly.  Of course, doing the requisite research is hard for me due to my disability.  I have started to do it and then I came across this very fascinating article in the New York times and it was the inspiration for this blog piece.  Perhaps a study should be done showing how many ABA therapists, speech and occupational therapists have moved to New Jersey from other states.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E7DE163AF93BA35751C0A9629C8B63&sec=health"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2008/12/new-jersey-special-education-largess.html", "title": "\nNew Jersey: The special education largess state?\n"},
{"date": " February 23, 2009", "body": "\nI have just read another interesting piece about the neurodiversity movement. This piece was good in that it seemed to give a well balanced perspective, showing both the pros and the cons of neurodiversity. One of the more interesting things was the article cited a study that was recently published in the  journal dyslexia showing that persons with autism and related disabilities who believed in the neurodiversity movement had greater self-esteem and academic aspirations than those autistics that did not believe in the ND philosophy. This is what the article states verbatim:According to recent research, people with autism who accept the neurodiversity platform have more self-esteem, and have more academic and career ambition that those who see autism as a medical condition with its array of disadvantages. In one study, students with autism who held the latter view more often applied for special assistance and monetary allowance through disabled students programs.The abstract of this study is hereAs regular readers of my blog could possibly surmise, this statement hits home with me as I am one of those on the autistic spectrum who finds neurodiversity about as appealing as poison ivy or hemorrhoids. I also have very low self-esteem.I have not read the actual article in Dyslexia myself, but I did read the abstract which was provided as a reference at the end of the blog piece I linked to. Therefore, I suppose I cannot completely comment on the specifics of the study and the findings. I do feel this whole idea raises some interesting concepts and questions which I would like to elucidate on.Is there a casual relationship between adopting a neurodiverse way of thinking and having an improved self-esteem, having greater chance of success academically, financially in romance etc. than an autistic with a negative point of view such as myself. The results of this research could be interpreted as such by someone who wants to put a positive spin in favor of the ND movement. This could be an argument in favor of neurodiversity.But when one looks at the typical proponent of neurodiversity we see that the majority of them seem to be females. This is in spite of the literature stating there is a 4:1 ratio of males to females. This ratio is somewhat controversial among some who claim that autism is underestimated in females, but to date, as far as I know, no empirical evidence has ever given this hypothesis any credibility. The neurodiversity persons are also for the most part much higher functioning than many others with autism including myself. Some of them can graduate college, hold down jobs and get married. One must wonder if these are a representative sample of autism. So this is equivalent to the age-old question of which came first, the chicken or the egg. Does neurodiversity result in higher self-esteem and possible success or is it that really the people who believe in ND are generally much higher functioning and would have greater career aspirations and would not be as inclined to need help from a disability office. This is in addition to the ND autistics being a very unrepresentative sample of most of those with autism.How would John Best's son or Harold Doherty's son stack up in this. Sam Best and Connor Doherty would probably not function at the level to have the same career aspirations as most ND autistics and would more likely require more financial assistance due to being lower functioning.Michelle Dawson has told me at one time that she was not unlike myself, that she longed for a cure for autism. At the time her self-esteem was low and she was not in good psychological shape. But since adopting her current way of thinking, she has done much better psychologically. Apparently a change in her attitude now makes her more happy about having a neurologic condition that causes her to self-mutilate herself. Why a person would not want to be cured of this I have no idea, but Michelle is an adult in control of her faculties and is only hurting herself, so if she wishes to remain this way, I am certainly not going to stop her.But one wonders if this attitude is helpful, or if deep down Michelle and other autistics really feel another way subconsciously. It was Sigmund Freud who postulated the concept of psychologic defense mechanisms I believe this provides the explanation for the higher self-esteem of those who believe in neurodiversity.Denial is one such defense mechanisms that the ND use. Denial means that they filter out those ideas that are unpleasant to them, such as autism being a defect. They can't deal with it, so they just deny this reality. This is why ASAN engaged in their campaign against the ransom notes for example. They could not deal with autism being a deficiency , so they just denied that fact.Another defense mechanism used widely by those in the ND movement is reaction formation turning something you truly hate into something you love. Therefore, the ND will say that autism equals genius and greatness and that Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin and others had autism. This explains michelle's attitudes. It explains why Kristina Chew would claim that she is satisfied with the functioning level of her autistic child, yet drugs him with dangerous psychiatric medication due to his functioning being so impaired. It explains why Estee Klar-Wolfhond would turn something she hates into something she takes joy in, ergo \"the joy of autism\" as a blog title. Ms. Chew and Ms. Wolfhond are parents who tried ABA on their children, lured by the pie-in-the-sky promise of a coin flip probability of complete normalcy after a few years of treatment. When the pie-in-the-sky promise in reality turned out to be shit-from-the-sewer, these ladies embraced neurodiversity in disillusionment. They needed this philosophy to help their self-esteem to help them deal with their handicapped children.Ergo, perhaps the results of this study are not all they seem.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://brainblogger.com/2009/02/23/autism-no-need-for-a-cure/", "http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121634494/abstract", "http://samvak.tripod.com/personalitydisorders21.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/02/does-neurodiversity-help-autistics-with.html", "title": "\nDoes Neurodiversity help autistics with self-esteem?\n"},

She seems to think gifted children should get more funding because they are bored and unchallenged in school. One good thing about the article was the last sentence which stated that if the autistic boy's gifted sister got the education she needed at taxpayer expense, she might find a cure for autism. At least this author does not adhere to a neurodiversity philosophy.The question is, should either the gifted or the challenged person receive extra funding, I believe the answer is no in both cases.If the author of the article would like to have a special gifted education for her daughter, let her pay for it out of her own pocket. Why should the taxpayer's foot the bill? The gifted child can clearly do the work and has an easier path than most. Richard Nixon came from a poor family, always went to public schools and received scholarships to ivy league schools, though he could not afford to live away from home, so attended Whittier college instead. He went on to graduate third in his class at Duke law school. Bill Clinton also came from a family of modest means, yet managed to become a Rhoades scholar and went on to Yale law school and became president of the United States. The daughter of friends of my parents also went to public school, but then went on to do well and attend yale university and later get a doctorate in english literature. If this girl is bored in a nongifted program, perhaps the girl's mother could encourage her to learn things on her own and acquire a broader education by going to the library.Of more salient interest is whether the state should pay the extra costs of special education for her autistic son at all. Is the IDEA a good law or just a travesty? It costs taxpayers billions of dollars, jams courts with parents who litigate for all the pie-in-the-sky promises that this law has to offer and drains their finances. It discriminates against the poor who cannot afford to pay attorneys to help them navigate through the maze of complex special ed law. Only the relatively wealthy are benefited by IDEA with the more impoverished parents of disabled kids getting the short end of the stick.Does this law really help kids live better lives? Will it improve their outcome after age 21 when they are aged out of the program? If there are any statistics, controlled studies or facts that demonstrate this I am certainly not aware of them.I only know of the other side of the coin about an article some years ago in the Atlanta Journal Constitution stating that the more years children spent in special education, the lower their achievement was academically. Also not long ago I wrote about half of california special ed students failing the high school exit exam.Ivar Lovaas published the famous 1987 study claiming that half of all autistics he treated with ABA functioned at a completely normal level and were indistinguishable from their peers. In effect, he claimed that he could cure autism in half of all cases. This study is used as evidence in special education lawsuits in order to obtain this costly treatment to students at taxpayer expense. Yet, the study employed aversives which are now outlawed in California where I live and probably other jurisdictions. Lovaas also distinguished between clinic based and work group ABA, the former consisting of many more hours and better trained personnel. His study employed clinic based ABA. As far as I know, there is nothing in the law that prevents a parent from suing for work group ABA or compromising with a school district so that the costly and unpleasant litigation can be avoided by both sides and having the school district pay for less hours and lesser trained personnel than were used in the 1987 study.Most germane of all, there are no published adult outcomes of the children whom Lovaas treated. They are now in their late 30's and early 40's and we have no idea what happened to them or how they did occupationally or whether they functioned at a completely normal level as adults. Lovaas has never published these results in a peer reviewed journal. Perhaps the reason for this is that the outcomes were actually less than stellar.On an interesting sidenote, I also wrote an essay about the irony of the Lovaas institute for early intervention and the social security office being located on the same floor of the same building in West Los Angeles. I submitted this essay to the Newsweek My Turn column. I never heard back from them. They only publish 1 in 200 essays they receive. Unlike the lady who authored this latest piece, mine did not make the cut. Instead, I published it on my web page The question still needs to be asked. Are the recipients of Lovaas' interventions today, the SSI collectors of tomorrow? There is certainly no evidence that the answer is not yes. Perhaps after making a visit to Lovaas' office in west L.A. they will go back to the same floor of the same building to apply for social security disability.Perhaps it is really time to rethink the whole IDEA law. I believe it is time to abolish it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.newsweek.com/id/186960", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/lovaas.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/03/my-turn-is-special-education-money-well.html", "title": "\nMy Turn: Is special education money well spent\n"},

Jake writes about a study that apparently tries to show that neurodiversity results in greater self-esteem for persons not only with autism but other developmental disabilities as well. I wrote about this same study very recently .I only read the abstract of the study and not the actual study itself, so I did not feel that it would be appropriate for me to comment on its methodology.   Unlike myself, Jake has done his homework.  He has read the entire study and gives a very interesting critique of its methodology.  One of the critiques was that only a small percentage of the study's subjects had an autism spectrum disorder and others had other types of developmental disabilities.  Of course I am not sure how relevant that is because the concept of ND could be applied to disabilities other than autism. Jake does take to task the fact that the study only apparently concentrated on career ambitions rather than actual success in careers itself.  He also cites the influence that neurodiversity proponents such as Kathleen Seidel and Camille Clark (AKA autism diva) have on doctors such as Paul Offit and possibly others as well. One interesting thing that caught my eye in Jake's piece was the fact that apparently this study included strokes as a category of neurodiversity.  I wonder if anyone who becomes aphasic or paralyzed from a stroke would just consider themselves as having a different form of brain wiring.  This would also be inconsistent with what some neurodiversity autistics have said about comparing autism to conditions such as Parkinson's disease.  That autism is something that you are born with so it is part of your intrinsic brain wiring, so I am not sure anyone else would consider stroke victims as having a form of neurodiversity other than the authors of this study.I won't go into the rest of Jake's article as it would spoil it for anyone else who may want to read it. Again, the age of autism is a webpage that gets far more readership than mine, so although I disagree with many of things they publish there I am glad that they have Jake as a contributor and that he is willing to have the chutzpah to take on the ND movement.  Something very few pro-cure autistics have unless they are willing to be called quisling and house autistics and all of the other abusive terms they use to insult anyone who disagrees with their point of view. Unlike, their excuse to bash autism speaks because they have no autistics on their board of directors, they cannot use this with the age of autism folks who are willing to have at least one autistic person as a contributor and in a position of some power in their organization.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/03/the-age-of-neurodiversity.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/03/jake-crosby-strikes-again.html", "title": "\nJake Crosby Strikes again\n"},
{"date": " March 6, 2009", "body": "\nKevin Leitch who writes for the leftbrain/right brain blog has just given his take on the IACC's strategic plan He seems to think there are some good things about it and some bad things.I have a couple of problems with him giving a take. First off, he lives in England and it is unlikely he has ever paid a dollar in American taxes. I wonder why it is anyone's business who has never paid taxes in the U.S.A. what a program created at taxpayer expense does . He is not the only one to do this. A couple of years ago Mike Stanton and Michelle Dawson(two other non-Americans) contacted the NIMH and gave their take on the direction that autism research should go in. I wrote about this when it happened but don't have the link handy. Estee Klar-Wolfhond (another non-American) also seems to think that she has a right to suggest what the IACC does in a letter she wrote to them with Ari Nee'man and some other persons.I wrote about this in a previous gadfly post The second problem I have is that apparently the NDs seem to think they should take an interest in this law, though this law was clearly passed with the intention of curing and preventing autism, something they have consistently opposed.As far as I am concerned no person who preaches a neurodiversity anti-cure philosophy has any business critiquing the IACC. If they are American taxpayers then they can write congress and attempt to have the combating autism act abolished. They then could suggest to congress that research and tax dollars be spent on the autism concerns that they are interested in. I agree they have a right to do this and try to have legislation passed that will pursue their agenda. If they have never paid any taxes in the U.S.A. as is likely the case with Kev Leitch, Michelle Dawson, Mike Stanton and Estee Klar-Wolfhond then I don't believe the CAA or the IACC is any of their business nor is any publically funded American autism research undertaking.One of the concerns that Kev has is about the intent of the plan to prevent autism. He seems to think it is a bad idea to prevent children from becoming crippled and sick as his daughter is. I find it very hard to believe if there had been a way for his daughter to live without being handicapped that he would not want this.Kev also seems confused as to whether or not the plan has the intent of curing autism. This should not be an issue. The IACC grew out of the combating autism act which was lobbied by Cure Autism now. There should be no question that the intent of the IACC strategic plan is to cure autism. The CAA said that one autistic person had to be appointed as one of the voting public members of the IACC. An unfortunate choice was made in appointing Stephen Shore, a member of the neurodiversity movement who opposes a cure for autism. Other than that one exception it is a pretty safe bet that every other public member and government member of the IACC is in favor of curing autism and is just as disgusted with the ND point of view as I am. This should be obvious to him, but it apparently is not.Joseph of the natural variation blog comments on this post and puts in his $.02. He writes:Preventing autism is something that people outside of the autism communities see as a positive. It does nothing for those of us in the autism communities. I\u2019m sure even the anti-vaxers don\u2019t care a whole lot about prevention. For those of us in the autistic community it\u2019s even somewhat offensive.Of course no one would oppose prevention of viral-cased or chemically-caused brain damage with a phenotype that presents as autism, as RAJ\u2019s strawman attempts to suggest. I am, however, completely opposed to any type of \u201cprevention\u201d that involves genetic screening and abortion.The anti-vaxers are certainly in favor of prevention, as it is their belief that taking thimerosal out of the vaccines and changing the vaccine schedule will prevent children from becoming autistic in the first place.Joseph once again trots out the tired cliches of the ND movement. It would seem he has either not read the wording in the IACC strategic plan or does not understand its meaning.He speaks of the \"autism community\" implying that people who believe in ND comprise the entire autism community but not autism speaks or most people with an interest in autism who do want to cure and prevent autism. We see this pattern of ND's trying to speak for all or most autistics or people interested in autism, when they are the ones out of the mainstream of the true autism community and are nothing but a fringe group. He also implies that prevention means abortion when it means nothing of the sort. The IACC's plan is here Here is the text that they write about prevention:It is critical for research to identify the methods and approaches that can be used to prevent the challenges and disabilities of ASD. Additionally, if one views ASD as a biological disorder triggered in genetically susceptible people by environmental factors, then prevention can include prevention of new cases of ASD through the identification and elimination of environmental causes. What is essential for ASD research is to develop the state of knowledge to a level similar to what is now available in fields such as cardiology. No longer do we need to wait for someone to suffer a heart attack before providing life-saving treatments. Rather, early interventions are applied upon the detection of risk factors so as to preempt these more serious consequences. Having sound research on the risk factors and the environmental triggers for ASD ultimately may allow us to achieve the goal of prevention: preventing the development of the disorder in some people at risk or reducing the degree of severity in those affected.with the talk of environmental causes and the comparisons with knowledge of cardiology, I don't see how prevention in this context can possibly be construed as genetic screenings for abortion. Leave it to the neurodiverse to misrepresent the facts.On a sidenote the CAA and the IACC seem to be a joke in that they would appoint Steve Shore an anti-cure autistic to a board created with taxpayer dollars with the intent of curing autism. Also, the appointment of Lynn Redwood and Mark Blaxill to the board in spite of the overwhelming evidence that vaccines don't cause autism is a travesty.Perhaps it is time for the private sector to take over as it would seem public sector funding may be keeping us in the stone age as far as advances in finding cures and prevention for autism are concerned. Of course, Autism Speaks, the main private sector funding body is probably a less than perfect organization, but I guess that will have to wait for a future post.Addendum to post: I see that Michelle Dawson is questioning my veracity on her TMOB comment board, denying that she has contacted the NIMH in any way trying to influence the direction of autism research in the USA. In my post of October 1, I stated that she and Mike Stanton had written letters to the NIMH.  I may have phrased this badly and had a memory lapse involving what had happened more than a year and a half earlier.  What I was referring to was a petition that was circulated by the autism hub a little over two years ago. Mike Stanton wrote about it on his blog in a post here. This was the instance that I was referring to in my post and what I wrote on Jonathan's journal on January 8,2007. Mike provided a link to the petition, unfortunately it is broken, so I cannot prove that Michelle Dawson was one of the people signing the petition. However, I would not make this up. A petition is a letter, so though Michelle Dawson never wrote a letter that was separate from the petition per se, she still contacted the NIMH by signing that petition to the best of my recollection.  If Michelle can produce the petition and prove to me that she never signed it I will stand corrected. Otherwise I still stand by my allegation that she has tried to influence the direction of research financed with American tax dollars by signing this petition.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1941", "http://www.iacc.hhs.gov/reports/2009/iacc-strategic-plan-for-aqutism-spectrum-disorder-research-jan26.shtml", "http://mikestanton.wordpress.com/2007/01/08/letter-to-america/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/03/kevin-leitch-gives-take-on-iacc.html", "title": "\nKevin Leitch gives take on IACC strategic plan\n"},
{"date": " March 7, 2009", "body": "\nI see once again Kristina Chew is railing for her son's educational future, by demanding that he receive \"the best\" level of education that can be offered. In the days when Chew was blogging on autism vox she also trotted out this fallacious argument that her son was entitled to \"the best\" (her words) education that could be obtained for him.Legally this is a fallacious argument. In the Rowley case in 1982 the supreme court determined that the words \"free and appropriate education\" did not mean \"best\" It is described on this website Here is some of the wording :The Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeals' decision, finding that the IDEA (then known as the EHA - Education Handicapped Act) did not require schools to proportionally maximize the potential of handicapped children. Rather, the Court said, Congress had more modest goals in mind. The Supreme Court relied upon the text and legislative history of the statute to find that Congressional intent was only to provide a \"basic floor of opportunity\" to students with disabilities by providing them access to public education, as opposed to addressing the quality of education received once in school.[10] The Court stated:By passing the Act, Congress sought primarily to make public education available to handicapped children. But in seeking to provide such access to public education, Congress did not impose upon the States any greater substantive educational standard than would be necessary to make such access meaningful \u2026Thus, the intent of the Act was more to open the door of public education to handicapped children on appropriate terms than to guarantee any particular level of education once inside.[11] So we see that Kristina Chew is asking the school district for something that she is not legally entitled to receive under special education law. What is surprising is that this is one of the most famous examples of case law that was decided by the supreme court. One wonders about the quality of special ed attorneys Ms. Chew has and what sort of advice they are giving her in terms of pursuing an education for her son and what she should say in IEP meetings. Because of the Rowley decision back in 1982 special education lawyers often advise their clients not to use the word \"best\" because of the Rowley decision. I don't know what sort of services her son Charlie receives, but one reason they may be less than satisfactory is that Ms. Chew exercises such bad judgment from a legal standpoint.What is most surprising of all is that in the days when she was blogging on autism vox prior to her moving over to change.org, she would often trot out this same fallacious argument. Time and time again I posted comments on her blog advising her that she was factually incorrect about the law and advising her of what the law under IDEA really is. In spite of this she never seemed to listen and now is posting this same nonsense again in her latest post.This is a woman who has claimed to me that she is satisfied with the functioning level of her son and that she has no desire to cure him. She claimed on national television that she was not suffering or heartbroken because of her son's condition. This is in spite of the fact that she has used ABA on her son, a treatment that purports to cure nearly 50% of all autistics. She has given her son dangerous psychiatric medications to control his behavior. In one recent blog entry she talked about the possibility of her son having to live in a residential placement. For this reason I suppose nothing she says should surprise me as is the case with most neurodiversity proponents.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_bottom_line_vs_the_best_education", "http://www.blogger.com/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/03/kristina-chew-just-doesnt-get-message.html", "title": "\nKristina Chew just doesn't get the message\n"},
{"date": " March 10, 2009", "body": "\nI was interested to read an article in the los angeles times today about the California state department of managed care declining to force insurers to pay for behavioral therapy for autistic children in spite of the fact that they are saying that insurers must pay for speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. The article quotes behavioral therapy as being quite expensive, costing as much as $70,000/year. The legal argument for requiring insurers to pay for autism care is a law called the Mental Health Parity Act, which requires insurers to treat mental conditions the same as medical conditions. I do not believe that this law would cover behavioral therapy ,as the mental conditions that are treated under this law are quite different from behavioral therapy for reasons I will outline in this blog post.The insurers argue that they are not required to pay for behavioral therapy because it is an educational service and not a medical condition. They also argue that this would drive up insurance premiums though studies from other states have found increases to be minimal. I suspect one problem with these studies is that the states which provide insurance for behavioral therapy have only recently done so and it is too early to measure effects that it would have on insurance costs.The article quotes ABA advocate Gina Green as saying some studies show that 47% of children are able to enter school with no further interventions and few if any symptoms of the condition. The only study that I know of that fits that description is Lovaas (1987) in which aversives (now illegal in the state of California) where used and in which there are no adult outcomes published, though they have been given NIMH money to study these and publish the results which they have not done.One of the differences between speech therapy/occupational therapy and behavior therapy is that speech therapists and occupational therapists are required to be licensed in California and are regulated by state agencies. Such is not true of ABA therapists. There are no licensing requirements for ABA therapists, no training requirements. Many behavioral therapists are college students, taking courses for credit in college in exchange for coming to people's homes and doing in home ABA, some of them are not even old enough to legally buy a six pack of beer. There is no state regulation of ABA therapists and they are accountable to no one.  I presume the treatments covered by the mental health parity act, are done by physicians( mostly psychiatrists) who are licensed and regulated by the state. Therefore it is my belief that the mental health parity act may not be a legally valid argument for forcing insurers to cover behavioral therapy.The precedent for no credentialing requirements for ABA therapists has its origin in special education case law. The Shannon Carter decision by the U.S. supreme court said that under IDEA parents could be reimbursed by the local education authority for private school education, even if the teachers in the private school are not credentialed. The Carter decision paved the way for the case of Malkentzos v. DeBuono which decided that uncredentialed Lovaas therapists could use behavioral therapy on autistic children. So under the IDEA there is a legal basis for the lack of credentialing and regulation of ABA therapists.However, the IDEA is not the mental health parity act. I feel that under the latter law, the former law would not be applicable and insurers should not have to pay for uncredentialed, unlicensed and unregulated ABA therapists.Parents have the legal right to pursue ABA therapy at taxpayer expense under IDEA. One of the problems with this is that the school districts will do what they can to avoid paying for the possible $70,000 a year treatment. Thus, parents will have to hire a lawyer and possibly pay a retainer of thousands of dollars, spend multiple time fighting the school district and even have the possibility of losing their case. If insurance covered this treatment this would not be a problem for the parents. This is why autism speaks unfortunately has successfully lobbied several states to enact legislation forcing insurance to pay for these treatments. This is why there is this movement in California.Another problem that I have written about in another gadfly post is that once insurance starts covering multiple autism treatments, autism will be looked at as a pre-existing condition.  This means that if an autistic child has leukemia, needs heart surgery, they may not be able to get insurers to insure them or their families if they change medical insurance and have had insurance pay for an autism treatment. Hopefully, the effort for insurance to pay for these treatments, particularly behavioral therapy, will not come to fruition in California, but with the resources of autism speaks as well as other powerful lobbies behind the people pushing for these changes, I am not terribly optimistic.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-autism10-2009mar10,0,7333027.story"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/03/should-insurers-be-required-to-pay-for.html", "title": "\nShould insurers be required to pay for behavior therapy for autism\n"},
{"date": " March 18, 2009", "body": "\nI have just read another work of jake crosby .  At some point, I may not publicize his individual essays as he certainly does not need my help given the relatively large circulation at age of autism and thankfully they are publishing even more of his essays; therefore it might be hard to keep up. But once again, he writes of the struggles of a high functioning autistic, the fact he only got a C on one of his college term papers because his autism impairs his ability to multitask. I realize this is trivial in comparison to the problems of the connor dohertys, russell rollens, dov shestacks and john belmontes, who barring an improbable miracle, will never be able to dream of going to a university like Brandeis that Jake attends and never be able to take care of themselves or live independent lives  or be able to communicate at anything but the most rudimentary level.  I am thankful to Jake for both letting us know about how flawed a concept neurodiversity is in a forum that will get good exposure and for the final line of his essay discussing about the antipathy that society has towards those of us on the spectrum and our delegation to the figurative wood pile.One thing that I would like to elaborate on and slightly take Jake to task for is not being specific enough. What I mean by this is that often the problems of persons at the less severe end of the spectrum such as Jake and myself are not acknowledged. I agree with Harold Doherty when he criticizes the NDs who want to speak for all autistics, including his son whose problems are far more severe than theirs. However, this does not mean that those of us at the upper end don't suffer. I agree barely passing a history term paper might seem trivial compared to other issues that befall certain autistics on the spectrum, but it still hurts me (and apparently Jake also) that we can't do as well at things as those without a disability.Joseph (one of the more prominent ND bloggers) has apparently felt that I am making a big deal about my mediocre academic performance in college claiming that I should be content with being average. This is in spite of the fact that I nearly flunked out of college, my ambitions to go to graduate school did not pan out, so I could not be an autism researcher like Matthew Belmonte or Lindsay Oberman and the others, he and the rest of the ND crowd just want to trivialize that. Yet Joseph in one of his old posts comes up with some figures projecting a 70% employment rate for all autistics at some future point. When there will be a 70% employment rate for autistics, I am not sure and Joseph not surprisingly is quite vague about the timeline. Also I am not sure where Joseph gets this figure, other than the fact that maybe 70% of autistics diagnosed today are not intellectually retarded and then a tacit assumption that all autistics without retardation will be able to work. Then Joseph goes on with the disclaimer that he is not claiming all nonretarded autistics will be able to work. So I am mystified where Joseph comes up with this figure. So, he seems to think I complain about nothing, yet my problems have impaired me from making a living and I have not been employed for some time, so according to Joseph's projections I am in the bottom 30th percentile.Temple Grandin has a similar attitude about mildly versus severely autistic persons. She favors a cure for those on the severe end of the spectrum, but apparently wants to preserve autism in mildly autistic people, because she believes that autism genes are responsible for invention and creativity.Simon Baron Cohen also wrote an essay claiming that high functioning autism should not be considered a disability as opposed to low functioning autism. The demarcation between functioning levels is not made clear by SBC. I notice he consulted David Andrews for this essay, someone who stoops to the nastiest insults and most abusive language you could imagine towards anyone who dares to disagree with his view on autism.  Andrews' participation in this essay should certainly diminish its credibility. SBC also takes a view about autism genes being advantageous in society that is similar to Grandins. I have refuted their reasoning in this essay.So don't forget those of us with mild autism.  Even if our problems are not as bad as Connor Doherty's and John Belmonte's, they are still bad enough.  The inability to do well academically and in employment and in romantic relationships does make life hard for at least some of us.  This is a fact that should not be forgotten.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/03/a-glimpse-inside-aspergers-syndrome.html#more", "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/11/debunking-costs-of-autism.html", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/03/jake-crosby-takes-nds-to-task-again.html", "title": "\njake crosby takes NDs to task again\n"},

My sister is a professor of computer science at Portland State University. I am reading her book now, still not quite finished with the book, I am about two-thirds of the way through it. I must confess it is somewhat technical and because of my disability and the generally difficult time I am going through I am having some trouble understanding all of it. I thought I would write about it in spite of this fact. Her book deals with the subject of complexity or how simple interactions among a myraid of individuals or indivual things can produce complex systems, such as how ants forage for food, how neurons in the brain interact to produce consciousness, etc. Scientists are very good at predicting simple things, like the velocity at which a bullet travels from a gun and the impact that it can have by simple equations. Other phenomena, such as weather prediction, the stock market, are much harder to predict because they involve the complex interactions of many entities. Melanie's book details how scientists study this phenomena.Melanie also talks about research she has done in trying to teach computers how to be more human like by teaching them analogies, such as if abc___> abe what would fgh_____> be, things like that, except somewhat more complex type of analogies.She also gives historical background on various physicists and mathematicians going back to the 17th century to near the present day, Isaac Newton to John Von Neuman.What is especially interesting to me is the implications it could have for possibly studying the brain and maybe helping to find some real answers to autism and related neurologic conditions.Another reason that I thought I would post about this is that two of the looniest looney tunes in the neurodiversity movement, Phil Gluyas and Clay Adams, have claimed that the reason that I long for a prevention and cure for autism is that I had a terrible mother who taught me to hate myself. They went on to say abusive and derogatory things about my mother in various forums. I realize that no rational person would take either of these two wingnuts seriously. However, after seeing what my sister accomplished and the book that she has written, if anything this should suggest my mother was exemplary in raising a child who has become the eminent scientist that my sister is.Portland and Los Angeles are about a thousand miles away from each other so I don't get to see my sister and her family very often. My sister is married and has two sons. My brother-in-law is a ph.d. physicist, his younger brother is also a ph.d. physicist as is their father. Neither of my nephews has autism and I am fairly certain there is no family history of autism in my brother-in-law's family. This provides evidence against the absurd arguments of Temple Grandin and Simon Baron-Cohen that autism should not be eradicated because it is responsible for the genes that produce these scientists as well as their equally absurd claims that autism is necessary for invention and civilization. I discuss this in more detail in in an essay I wrote\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Complexity-Guided-Tour-Melanie-Mitchell/dp/0195124413/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1237993056&sr=8-1", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/03/my-sisters-book.html", "title": "\nMy sister's book\n"},
{"date": " March 29, 2009", "body": "\nI have just read an interesting piece about Jenny McCarthy . These are some stories that her ex-husband are claiming about some rather salacious sexual exploits that Ms. McCarthy was involved in. As most persons interested in autism know, Jenny McCarthy has a son with this ex who has been diagnosed as autistic (the son not the ex). She has embraced biomed treatments and the rather notorious generation rescue run by the litigation happy J.B. Handley. She is now claiming that chelation and other biomed treatments have cured her son as well as other questionable allegations.Though I despise the neurodiversity movement, I do agree with them that McCarthy is doing harm and giving parents false hope. However, I do believe she is a mother who has the best intentions and wants to help her child and other children. She does seem to provoke the ire of the neurodiversity movement and autism diva once called her Jenny McDumbbell. Since ND's often want to engage in personal attacks I suspect they may use this article as further ammo.On an interesting side note I met Jenny McCarthy at a DAN conference. DAN conferences are not something I would normally attend and I would probably never go to one again, but Stephen Shore who is a friend of mine was presenting at one relatively close to where I live, so I checked it out. McCarthy had stated on the Larry King show that she had never met any autistic adults. Steve, a girl named Kelly, and myself were the first adults with autism that McCarthy met. When I pointed that out to her, her response was \"you guys are awesome\".Also interesting is the last line of the article with John Asher, McCarthy's ex, making the comment that having an autistic child either brings the parents closer together or pulls them apart. It would seem that he is implying that their son's autism is responsible for their divorce- I kinda suspect that's going to rattle the cage of ND just a smidgen.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/mccarthys%20ex%20reveals%20bedroom%20secrets_1098891"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/03/jenny-mccarthy-more-ammo-for-angry.html", "title": "\njenny mccarthy: more ammo for angry neurodiversitites?\n"},
{"date": " April 8, 2009", "body": "\nYet another story that I am surprised that Estee Klar-Wolfhond will not blog about in her joy of autism blog. A storyabout a man with autism hitting a baby. The 28-year-old man hit the baby who was six months old and left a bruise on its head. When questioned, the man acknowledged that he needed help and hoped to get it. Yet, when asked why he hit the baby he exclaimed, \"it was an accident, don't worry about it.\" Yet one has to wonder how a man could hit a 6 month old baby by accident.The man's mother was shopping with her son in a K-mart in Wichita Kansas when this happened and says she cannot keep complete control of him and was worried about the baby being harmed. Apparently the baby had a bruise and other than that was not seriously harmed. She states that he has harmed children before.The mother acknowledged that her son did not get much help growing up. Naturally this lead to an autism expert claiming that autistics do these things because they don't get early intervention, using this tragedy as an opportunity to get behind the figurative bully pulpit and preach the mantra of early intervention being some sort of solution to the problems of autistics.  This was followed by a shameless plug for this autism expert's special education school in Wichita.  Of course, there is no proof any intervention in this man's childhood would have curbed his violent tendencies. The baby's mother contacted a prosecutor in the Wichita city attorney's office. She was told charges would not be pressed against the man because of his inability to know right from wrong.The boy's mother has asked for possible solutions to her son's problem with hitting children. She stated in the article, \"what am I supposed to do, lock him up, shoot him?  I wish society would give me an answer.\"  I wonder if anyone from the neurodiversity movement could give the mother  an answer, since they seem to believe autism needs to be accepted rather than cured or prevented.  They don't want autism speaks to fund science that would find a cure or even better treatments for someone like this, or find a way to prevent the man from becoming autistic in the first place.   Chaotic idealism would just state that the mother needs to write a post on wrongplanet or aspies for freedom and one of the experts at either of these two pristine web sites would offer her a solution.Ari Neeman would just say that being anti-cure is not being anti-progress and not to worry.Somehow I wonder if either of these solutions would cut it or if someone from the ND movement has some answer that would help this man and his mother.  Or do they still want to say this behavior should be accepted and not be cured or prevented? Also, I am waiting for all of these exploitive special educators to offer proof that their schools and interventions would prevent something like this from happening.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kwch.com/Global/story.asp?S=10146186&nav=menu486_2_2"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/04/autistic-man-hits-baby.html", "title": "\nautistic man hits baby\n"},
{"date": " April 13, 2009", "body": "\nOne of the hottest areas of brain research today is that in the field of mirror neurons. Neuroscientist Marco Iacoboni has written a book on that subject entitled \"Mirroring People\". Your humble blogger has just finished this book. Mirror neurons are neurons that fire not only when a person is doing a motor action but also when the motor action is being viewed or a sound associated with the motor action is being heard. One of the most interesting things about mirror neurons (at least to your humble blogger) is that there is strong evidence that they are involved in the etiology of autism.Mirror neurons were discovered by accident in a laboratory in Italy. Neuroscientists were doing research on neuron firing in the motor cortex and premotor cortex area of macaque monkeys, particularly in the area called F5 in the frontal lobe. When one of the researchers was eating something or picking something up to grasp it, the neuron fired. The neurons also fired on hearing the sound of an action. Intrigued, the researchers ruled out all of the possibilities other than the neuron was firing upon viewing the action or hearing the sound.  Therefore, it seemed that these neurons had to do with imitation of an action or learning an action.For obvious reasons, the experiments involving the implanting of electrodes in single neurons that had been done on the monkeys could not be done on human beings (at least not ethically). However, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, which measures the level of blood flow to certain areas of the brain, experiments can be done on human subjects to see if certain areas of the brain are activated when doing a given task or viewing a picture or face. It was shown that both during movements and viewing of pictures of the movement the areas of the human brain that were analogous to those of the monkeys in the experiments were active. This suggested that human beings have mirror neurons as well.The area F5 on the macaque monkey motor cortex is equivalent to Broca's area in the human brain. Broca's area is the center that is responsible for expressive speech. The ability to imitate it would seem comes from mirror neurons. As most interested in autism know, one of the cardinal symptoms of autism is a speech delay before age three. There are studies going back to the 1950's showing that autistics have deficits in imitation. Research was also done showing that mirror neurons played a factor in the emotion of empathy as well as the ability to make friends. In experiments done in which children were asked to imitate facial expressions, the part of the brain near broca's area was measured by blood oxygen uptake using fMRI. It was found that there was a correlation between activity in these brain levels and the number of friends and playdates these children had (Pfeifer, et. al. 2008) .For these reasons it was speculated that mirror neurons might play a role in the etiology of autism. At about this time Vilayanur Ramachandran and Lindsay Oberman at the University of California at San Diego were doing research on what is called mu wave suppression in autistic children.  Mu waves are a form of brain waves, which are electrical impulses which eminate from the brain that are reflective of activity (or inactivity) in various parts of the brain.  Mu waves are suppressed in typical people both when they move parts of their own body and observe movement of those same body parts in other people, analogous to the mirror neuron firing in the monkeys that I discussed previously. The research of Ramachandran and Oberman found that when autistics moved their own body parts, their mu waves were suppressed. However, upon observing the motions of other people or a hand on a video, the autistics had no mu wave suppression. One of the limitations of this work was that all 9 of the autistic subjects were high functioning males. They acknowleged the limitations in their paper, emphasizing they were not sure whether or not these findings could be generalized to lower functioning autistics and female autistics. However, this is a problem that often occurs in autism research. Compliance is needed by the subjects in order to study brain waves or brain activity measured by an fMRI. The lower functioning autistics would not be compliant and would move around and this would cause artifacts in the measurements, making the findings worthless. Though autistic males outnumber autistic females by about 4 to 1, the ratio may be as high as 10:1 in the higher functioning groups. Ergo, in many research studies we see a biased sample of research subjects as opposed to the entire population of autistics.Mirella Dapretto (who happens to be Dr. Iacoboni's wife) has also done a study comparing activity of subjects with high functioning autism in an area of the brain called the pars opercularis (which is a part of broca's area) in which mirror neurons exist to normal controls matched for approximate age and sex (again all of the autistic subjects were high functioning males). She found significantly greater activity in this area for the autistics. Additionally she found negative correlations between the activity levels and the severity of the autism as measured by the ADOS diagnostic scale.One of the findings on autopsies of autistic brains has been abnormalities of the limbic system which controls emotion in which exist the hippocampus and amygdala. I seem to remember autopsies have shown differences in the amygdalas of autistics as opposed to normal controls. An area of the brain called the insula connects the pars opercularis (and maybe the rest of Broca's area also) to the limbic system. A variety of researchers besides these have also done experiments showing of a mirror neuron dysfunction in autistics. So there is strong evidence suggesting that there is a dysfunction in the pathways between the pars opercularis and limbic system connected by the insula.There is also a mirror neuron system in the parietal lobe of the brain as well as the frontal lobe. Riitta Hari has done research using a technology magnoelectroencephalogram which picks up tiny magnetic activity in various brain areas with Asperger's subjects. She asked them to imitate simple movements of the mouth and face while using this technology and measured the activity. Her research demonstrated abnormally slow communication between the mirror neurons in the frontal lobes and mirror neurons in the parietal lobes of these subjects. It was speculated that this faulty wiring might be responsible for the social deficits of people with Asperger's.There are also gender differences in mu wave rhythms of the mirror neuron system I have to admit I have not actually read this study but I have linked to the abstract. If anyone is interested I guess they can pursue the matter further. I believe this may be relevant in light of the high male to female ratio found in autistics.Anne Corwin, another of the infamous neurodiversity rogues and author of the existence is wonderful blog gives her take on mirror neurons.  She trots out the traditional \"different not broken\" neurodiversity homily in her essay.  The interested reader can read the link. I am not sure what to make of this research.  Prior to this research a lot of the emphasis in autistic neuroanatomy was on the cerebellum and the limbic system.  The insula connecting the the pars opercularis and the limbic system could give an explaination for the limbic system involvement in autism.  However, what of the cerebellar abnormalities that have been found in autistics in various studies, albeit with mixed results.  What role do the mirror neurons located in the frontal and parietal lobes play?  Also, why don't people with Broca's aphasia from CVAs exhibit the same behavioral characteristics as autistics since part of their mirror neuron system has been damaged also.  As I have mentioned in previous blog posts, Eric Courchesne (and Matthew Belmonte also) have told me that developmental lesions are different than adult lesions.  When I speculated to Courchesne that because of the speech motor output problems of autistics perhaps autism could be either a problem in Broca's area or the connections between Broca's and Wernicke's area (Wernicke's area in the temporal lobe is responsible for the reception of language as opposed to the expresison of language of Broca's), he replied that because of the differences in developmental and adult lesions this might not be a fruitful area of research.  The recent findings of evidence of a dysfunction in the mirror neuron system of autistics would not seem to bear out Courchesne's contention.If anyone with more expertise in neuroscience than I have happens to read this, I would certain welcome comments and speculations from them.  I know that irrational hope makes me think that mirror neurons may be the holy grail of autism work rather than yet another seeming dead end street.  I just wish that mirror neuron research could lead to more effective treatments or even possibly the cure that neurodiversitites such as Anne Corwin detest so much.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=mirroring+people&x=14&y=26", "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2361218", "http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/1726/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/04/mirror-neuron-minutae.html", "title": "\nmirror neuron minutae\n"},
{"date": " April 16, 2009", "body": "\nI see that the neurodiversity movement has come out with a new public service announcement film:The film shows four members of the neurodiversity movement with their pollyannish statements about how autism is not a tragedy, they are not empty shells and that it is okay to be autistic. The film features four different individuals who state that they are autistic. I will give my take on these four individuals not in the order of their appearance. The first person in the film whom I will comment on is an apparently nonverbal autistic who only communicates using a communication computer. His name is Jacob Pratt. I am giving my take on Jacob first because I agree with his statement that he is autistic secondarily and a person first and that he should be treated with respect. However, what is truly ironic about this statement is that it contradicts one of the tenets of the ND movement that autism is who they are. Their brain is hardwired from birth and if a cure were ever found for autism, it would kill them in the sense it would completely change their entire brain and turn them into another person. Research on the etiology of autism has probably not yet advanced to the point that it completely disproves this allegation; however, as is typical, the neurodiversitites have no proof for this completely speculative idea. It certainly contradicts my experience as having my ability to read intact, yet I have perceptual motor deficits that impair my ability to handwrite and put puzzles together. There is a 40 point discrepancy between my scores on the verbal IQ test and the performance IQ test. This suggests that part of my brain is intact and part of it is impaired, so I can give that take from my own personal experience if no one else's.The second person in the video is a young man named Ben Liske who can't possibly be older than 12 years old. He states that at this young age he is a mathematician, musician and scholar and that with the right supports he can do anything anyone else can but not in the same way. Given the fact he is not yet an adult and has not even attempted to make a living, this is certainly a premature statement. If neurodiversity has a different way that anyone with autism can do things as well as anyone else, I am sure that Harold Doherty, JB Handley and other parents who long for a cure for their children would embrace these with open arms. Naturally they give no solutions other than Ari Nee'man's automaton \"being anti-cure is not being anti-progress\". More about Neeman later.The third person they have on this video is Deena Gassner, a person with alleged autism who is so high functioning that she was able to get married, have a child and become a licensed clinical social worker. I have first hand experience with Deena as I have met her in person at a couple of different national ASA conferences. She does not seem to be autistic to me and what impairments she has or what would lead any physician or clinical psychologist to diagnose her as autistic is beyond me.Last, but certainly not least is ASAN president Ari Nee'man who uses the \"royal we\" that Harold Doherty has written about in his blog: \"our lives are not tragedies\" \"The national conversation about autism is happening without us\". Nee'man is someone who was born in approximately 1987 and was not diagnosed with Asperger's (not classic autism with a speech delay) until he was 12 years old. Apparently, before that time, he was thought of as having ADHD. He certainly has nothing in common with people with severe autism such as Dov Shestack, Connor Doherty, and John Belmonte. John Belmonte, the brother of brain researcher Matthew Belmonte, cannot speak and barring a miracle will have to live in a group home under 24/7 supervision for the rest of his life. Nee'man's empty platitudes offer no solutions to someone like this. He has no solution to the fact that I have to be unemployed and celibate, that I can't wrap presents at Christmas time or have handwriting that is only semi-legible that is a strain to get out. He has no solutions to the fact that I cannot interact with people, have few friends and cannot help making funny movements in public and drawing attention to myself or the multitude of other problems that make my life hard. All he wants to do is speak for everyone on the autistic spectrum, including those of us like myself who had a speech delay at age 3 and are high functioning autistic rather than asperger's.I would also like to comment on Nee'man's completely fallacious statement that the national conversation about autism is happening without him and others of his ilk. In 2006 when congress was debating the combating autism act Nee'man and his friends literally protested with placards. Yet when this law was passed he and the rest of the neurodiversity hypocrites embraced this law and immediately went to the IACC with all sorts of suggestions. The IACC had no problem apparently listening to their agenda. In spite of the fact the only purpose of the CAA and the IACC's creation was to cure and prevent autism. Therefore, I believe Nee'man and the other neurodiversitites are being given a free pass to which they are not entitled.If neurodiversitites have a solution to the problems of autistic people, then they should state them on their web pages instead of wasting time, making such superficial vacuous videos. They have provided no evidence that their quick fix solutions to the problems of autism are anything other than myths. I must agree with Nee'man's statement at the end of the video that it is time to leave old stereotypes behind. It is a shame that Ari cannot practice what he preaches.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/04/more-mythology-from-neurodiversity.html", "title": "\nMore mythology from neurodiversity\n"},
{"date": " April 18, 2009", "body": "\nI have just gotten an e-mail from a new organization that has formed called the autism science foundation. This organization seems to be very similar to autism speaks, except obviously it will be much smaller. There are some differences. The organization is being started by Allison Tepper-Singer who was featured in the infamous video in which she stated that she contemplated driving off a bridge with her autistic child in the car.   She will be the president of the organization.  Also Tepper-Singer recently resigned from her position at Autism Speaks due to the fact that she does not believe that vaccines are a causative agent in autism. Given the fact that Sally Bernard is on the board of directors of AS and the wish to appease parents who cling to the misguided belief that vaccines cause autism, AS has started to fund projects that seek out a connection between autism and vaccines. Tepper-Singer in her email emphasizes the fact that the autism science foundation will not fund research related to vaccines and conceded that the evidence has exonerated vaccines as a cause of autism. She has started with organization with Karen London who along with her husband, psychiatrist Eric London started NAAR (National alliance for autism research) which along with CAN (cure autism now) merged with autism speaks about four years ago. Also Paul Offit who wrote the book false prophets of autism, which goes into the work showing vaccines do not cause autism is also on the board of directors. For these reasons it seems there is a good chance that it will remain a \"pro-vax\" organization. However, one never knows what pressure from the many parents of autistic children who insist their child became autistic because of a vaccine will influence this fledgling organization at some point. Also on ASF's board of directors:Michael Lewis, attorney, mediator and grandfather of a child with autism. ASF\u2019s Scientific Advisory Board, still in formation, includes Dr. Emanuel DiCicco-Bloom (UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School; past program chair of the International Society for Autism Research); Dr. Ami Klin (Yale Child Study Center); Dr. Harold Koplewicz (NYU Child Study Center); Dr. Sharon Humiston (University of Rochester); Dr. Eric London (NYS Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities and co-founder of NAAR); Dr. Catherine Lord (University of Michigan); and Dr. Matthew State (Yale Medical School).It will be interesting to see how and to what extent this new organization becomes another whipping boy for the ND movement.  I still remember the pre-autism speaks days when there was just CAN and NAAR.  CAN and by extension Jon Shestack and Portia Iverson got the brunt of the ND criticism and abuse, including autistics.org's infamous and tasteless abortion cartoon.  NAAR generated some protests but not to the same extent as CAN. The organization is small, just starting out and clearly does not have the capital and resources of autism speaks, so it will remain to be seen how long they last and what sort of influence they have.  Of course, one possible small advantage that they have is Tepper-Singer's seat on the IACC.  With Singer tendering her resignation from AS, autism speaks has no representation on the IACC.  Ironically enough, the neurodiversity movement, with Stephen Shore at the helm and who is another one of the public members ,has more representation on the IACC than AS itself, in spite of the fact Jon and Portia are on the board of directors of AS and it was CAN who originally lobbied for the combating autism act, whose only intention was to find ways to prevent and cure autism. One other thing, on perusal of ASF's web site, that I am unclear on, is the extent that they will do lobbying of government agencies in the manner that AS has done.  If they do, given that they are small and just starting out they will not likely have the same influence.  I am a believer in the old saw of too many cooks spoil the broth.  It is just better if these organizations fund scientific research that will lead to advances in the understanding of causes of autism and its possible treatments, assuming prevention and cure may not be realistic goals in the foreseeable future.Personally I am glad this second organization was created.  Having one monopoly like Autism Speaks leads to an organization that will get less good things done.  I don't feel that autism speaks should be the only game in town.  Also, there are alternative organizations to go to for scientists who need funding.  Also, their emphasis on vaccines not causing autism is welcome.  Vaccine research has just been one dead end after another and has nothing promising to offer.Time will tell what the future bodes for the autism science foundation.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/04/rival-to-autism-speaks.html", "title": "\nA rival to Autism speaks?\n"},
{"date": " April 14, 2009", "body": "\nI see that my friends from the autistic self-advocacy network are at it again. This is the organization that was famous for pressuring the autism clinic in New York to eliminate the ransom notes campaign for the language that they perceived to be insulting. Also, they are well known for the statement that Ari Neeman, their president, made on the Good Morning America television show, \"being anti-cure is not being anti-progress\". Though it is puzzling to this blogger how eliminating the ransom notes was any sort of progress that could be substituted for a cure. More on that later though.In this instance, a lady named Meg Evans who states that she is autistic, yet is high functioning enough to be married takes umbrage at the language used on the Cincinnati Marathon web site that is used to raise funds for autism. Ms Evans states:On your front page, promoting the Run/Walk for Autism, there is a comparison of autism to cancer, diabetes, and AIDS, which misleadingly causes people to view autism as a disease that their family members are at risk of catchingShe further goes on:In fact, autism is a developmental condition, not a disease; it does not make anyone sick or kill anyone, and it cannot be acquired from contact with autistic people. Comparing autism to deadly diseases such as AIDS can cause uninformed people to shun autistic individuals out of a groundless fear that they or their family members will somehow catch autism. For the same reason, autism should not be characterized as an \"epidemic,\" which is a term that usually refers to an outbreak of contagious disease.Let's view each of these statements in context. On perusal of the run for autism organizer's web site we see that the only comparisons made to Cancer, diabetes and AIDS are the citing of the CDC's 1/150 prevalence number for autism and stating that autism is more common than these other conditions. I am not sure that this is saying the conditions are analogous. As far as someone \"catching autism\", the only one of three conditions cited that someone can get with contact with another human being is AIDS. AIDS can only be transmitted through sex or a blood transfusion, it is not like transmitting a cold or a sore throat, so we see a very specious comparison on the part of Ms. Evans. Even if there was a comparison of autism with AIDS in the fact that they both could be considered medical conditions, certainly no one in their right mind would read this statement and conclude that someone could catch autism.Ms Evans also goes on to state that autism is not a disease and that autism should not be viewed as an epidemic, because the term epidemic is used to connote outbreaks of infectious conditions.My dictionary defines disease: A condition of the living animal or plant body or one of its parts that impairs the performance of a vital function. The fact that autistics often can't make a living, in the more severe cases, can't speak, can't fend for themselves, have uncontrollable behavior that causes them to get into trouble or self-mutilate certain is the impairment of a vital function, so i must respectfully disagree with Ms. Evans' definition of disease.My dictionary defines epidemic: 1. affecting or tending to affect many individuals within a population community or region at the same time. excessively prevalent. I do not know if the prevalence of autism is actually increasing or not. As is the case of neurodiversitites, I do believe that at least part of the increase is due to more people actually being diagnosed than were diagnosed before and not necessarily a real increase in the numbers; however, that is neither here nor there. The point is, that an epidemic can be used to refer to an increase in any phenomena, not necessarily a medical condition.Autistic people are largely unemployed. The problem of celibacy and loneliness does exist for many of us. There are problems with housing, self-mutilation, phobias and academic performances. How, this current crusade of Ms. Evans' How Ari Neeman's pro-progress, anti-cure metaphors are helping anyone with autism is beyond me. I won't attempt to speak for most or all autistics as many neurodiversitites seem to have an inclination to do. However, many of us do suffer, many of us have the problems stated above, myself included. This is in addition to the perceptual motor deficits that I have (which I realize not all autistic people have) which makes it practically impossible for me to handwrite and wrap presents at Christmas time. How does the absurd claim that statements saying that autism is more common than AIDS, cancer or diabetes lead anyone to believe that autism could be contagious help anyone with autism?What of Ms. Evans' statements that autism does not kill anyone. In my own personal case, I demonstrated poor social judgment at age 17 and let a friend without a driver's license drive my car while we were drunk. He crashed the car into a wall and I went through the windshield and was injured but did not die. I could have died at age 17. What about Ashley Brock who died of accidental drowning due to her autism? There was also a boy who was run over by a train in North Carolina. Also, I don't recall the name but there is an autistic man who killed his mother. This has recently received some media attention.  It could certainly be argued that this woman would be alive today if her son had not had autism. There was also an article in a recent Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders about a 10 year old autistic girl who threw her six month old baby sibling out a window and killed them.  Certainly Ms. Evans' arguments that autism can't kill or have the potential to kill are fallacious. When we look at the t-shirt on the web site that Ms. Evans links to, we see the moving message on it:  Because I love someone with autism.  So the organizers of these fund raisers are certainly not trying to offend people.  They are only raising money out of love for their children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews.  Neurodiversitites seem to have some trouble realizing this.Once again ASAN's statements and actions truly baffle me.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://asansouthwestohio.blogspot.com/2009/04/opposing-alarmist-rhetoric.html", "http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ747962&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ747962"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/04/more-nonsense-from-asan.html", "title": "\nMore nonsense from ASAN\n"},
{"date": " April 20, 2009", "body": "\nSince last Friday I see that the favorite organization of a lot of people, everyone from the neurodiversitites to the mercury militants to the biomed treatment advocates has once again engaged in superficial showmanship with their new program autism in the workplace. AS starts off stating how dire the problem of lack of even semi-gainful employment is for autists:Unemployment and underemployment remain challenges for people with autism and other disabilities. A 2004 Louis Harris Poll found that only 38% of individuals with a disability were employed, as compared to 78% of those who did not have a disability. It is estimated that more than a quarter of adults with a disability live in poverty, and more than seventy-five percent earn less than $20,000 per year (Bowe, 2006).Then we see some interesting videos of persons with autism in the workforce, trying to show autistic employees in a positive light. Of interest is that I am acquainted with one of the participants, Stephen Wise. Steve lives in Los Angeles and we would run into each other from time to time at AGUA (Adult Gathering United Autistic) meetings. This is an organization that I helped create along with Jerry Newport and I am one of the charter members. AGUA has now been in existence for 16 years. A movie, Mozart, and the Whale was made that was inspired by some events that happened at AGUA. The character, Gregory in the movie was inspired by your humble blogger.It is my belief that these videos and this new crusade by AS is nothing but a horse and pony show. Steve's job was obtained for him through the Jay Nolan center not AS.  I am pretty certain autism speaks had nothing to do with securing employment for any of the other people in these videos. If anyone can provide me with evidence to the contrary I stand corrected. This would seem like exploitation on the part of AS.I should be somewhat surprised that the angry neurodiversitites who detest AS so much have not written about this on any of their blogs.  But what is so typical of them is that they miss the forest for the trees. Somehow it gets under their skin that there is no person on the autism spectrum on the board of directors. They seem to go even further implying that one of their own should be appointed to that coveted position, someone completely hostile to the goals of prevention and cure that AS has. But what is really more important, one person who would have an unpaid position of influence helping to run the show behind autism or perhaps the organization actually doing something to help people find jobs or even employing them in their own organization for paid jobs? I believe that the latter is a far more important priority than the former.Does AS itself have anything to say in the manner? We see here the following statement on the part of the autism in the workplace webpage:Autism Speaks provides internships to adults with autism in its offices, and also outsources work to companies that employ people with autism. The organization is currently exploring the creation of employment opportunities, as well.Well in the opinion of this blogger that does not cut it at all.  Internships mean an unpaid position.  At the very least they could employ someone with autism to be a file clerk in their office and give them extra help in doing the job so that they would not be fired.  In fact, one of those persons could even be me.  I do not believe that it is ethical for AS to have started this program until they finished actually exploring the creation of those employment opportunities for people on the spectrum but actually created them as well and then had the person(s) complete a 3 to 6 month probationary period on the job and then put a video about these people and not ready made autism workers for their own exploitive ends.  At the risk of repeating myself, I believe that autism speaks should just be an organization that funds scientific research with the intent of curing and preventing autism.  Engaging in lobbying, advocacy and awareness as well means that too many cooks spoil the broth.  The organization tries to do too much at once does not get enough done and it won't hasten a cure and/or prevention for autism being found.  Of course, something like this autism in the workplace campaign had it been done in a proper and ethical manner as I stated above would be an exception to that rule the way I see it. I find it interesting that in spite of all of these activities autism speaks is basically a charitable organization.  I believe that they should actively recruit persons with autism to work directly for their organization as paid employees, not interns, not contractors.  Being that they are a charitable organization perhaps autism speaks should remember the old saying: \"Charity begins at home\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/press/autism_in_the_workplace.php", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/community/family_services/autism_in_the_workplace.php"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/04/autism-in-workplace-hypocrisy-from.html", "title": "\nAutism in the workplace: hypocrisy from autism speaks\n"},
{"date": " April 23, 2009", "body": "\nLindsay Oberman is a ph.d. brain scientist with an interest in doing research on mu wave suppression in autistic children. Mu waves are electroencephalographic signals that are abnormal in some instances in persons with autism. I have discussed this work in a previous post so I won't go into all the details of Dr. Oberman's work.Dr. Oberman also writes a blog sponspored by Psychology Today magazine in which she posts entries from time to time. She wrote a blog piece which I responded to and just now Dr. Oberman has responded to my response. I was somewhat disillusioned what seemed to me to be her somewhat positive take on the neurodiversity movement in her post and wrote a comment on her blog.I am an autistic man who wants to be cured, though I don't feel it is probable that there would be a cure in my lifetime. However, if your work on mu wave suppression could lead to an autistic person being able to control their mu waves and this helping them to function better even in leiu of a cure I would certainly be in favor of that. What is ironic about one anti-cure autistic, Michelle Dawson, is that she works with a group that receives funding from autism speaks and has not resigned from the group in protest. None of these autistics who are against a cure for autism seem to mind money coming from an organization where the people raising the money, organizing the walks, etc. most likely long for a cure.Dr. Oberman replied with the following after captioning her post that she respectfully disagreed with me:believe that we will find a \"cure\" or atleast much more effective treatments for autism in the next 10-20 years. There are many very hard working and dedicated scientists whose line of research is just that. My line of research however, is much less \"controversial\". I do not claim that there should or should not be a \"cure\" but rather to understand the mechanisms that lead to one person to develop autism while another does not. What processes develop differently in the brain of someone with autism compared to someone without. This is my main interest and though with this knowledge, we can also begin to develop more effective treatments aiming at the cause rather than the symptoms, it also provides a better understanding as to why one person develops autism and another does not, which is important information in and of itself.I feel this is a good way of looking at things, so I suppose she does not totally subscribe to a neurodiversity point of view. What is of most interest is her optimistic statement which seems to me to be implying that some major breakthrough could happen as soon as ten years from now. Of course I guess I will find out if I am still living in ten years from now and even still living in twenty years from now which is a distinct possibility though not a guarantee set in stone. There is an old Danish proverb Death does not blow a trumpet.What intrigued me about this saying is that when I first became a research subject for Eric Courchesne's group and just before I had my first MRI scan, I met Rachel Courchesne who was his wife at the time. I asked her if she felt that the research they were doing could at some point perhaps translate into better treatments for persons with autism even if not a cure. She stated that she believed that in 20 years, there was a good chance the research they were doing could translate into better treatments. A similar timeline to Dr. Oberman's but not quite as optimistic as her ten year leeway. Ms. Courchesne made this statement to me in April, 1989 exactly twenty years ago. Twenty years and much more diagnoses of autism later, this prediction did not come to fruition. ABA is still the treatment of choice, gaining huge ground in the U.S.A., particularly since the 1991 legislation adding autism as an eligible category to receive services under IDEA. There do not seem to be any advances at all.I concede it is certainly possible that if in theory autistic persons could learn to control their mu waves with neuro/biofeedback perhaps some autistics could be helped immensely from this treatment. The problem with Dr. Oberman's work per se, is that her recent study only had 9 subjects, all of whom were males and all of whom were at least moderately high functioning. It is likely she had to exclude fairly low functioning persons from her work, because they would not have the necessary compliance to sit still and have valid brain wave measurements taken. Dr. Oberman did the right thing and conceded the limitations of her study in her paper, acknowledging the work might not be applicable to female autistics or lower functioning male autistics.I wonder if Oberman's prediction will come true. I guess in ten years' time if I am still alive and I still have this blog I can write about it again. Time will tell.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://blogs.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-autism-spectrum/200901/new-day"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/04/dr-lindsay-obermans-interesting.html", "title": "\nDr. Lindsay Oberman's interesting timeline\n"},
{"date": " April 27, 2009", "body": "\nI see that the neurodiversity movement continues to get even more media attention with the latest article about them in Salon magazine by Elizabeth Svoboda. My pain and suffering naturally are ignored by the media as well as the far greater pain and suffering of persons much more severely autistic than myself such as Russell Rollens, Dov Shestack, Connor Doherty and John Belmonte-most of these individuals have an extremely poor prognosis and will probably have to spend their entire life in a group home or other type of institutional setting at some point. It is not likely they will ever be able to write about their suffering from autism in a blog post the way the ND's can. Svoboda talks about the comparisons that neurodiversity organizations such as Jim Sinclair's ANI make with curing autism to curing homosexuality or left-handedness. Autism is clearly a dysfunction or disorder, though these two conditions are not. Many neurodiversity proponents themselves try to have it both ways and claim that autism is really a disability. (though sometimes the definition of disability is different than some people might think-a social disability as opposed to a medical disability), though I don't think anyone would say that left-handedness or homosexuality are disabilities that impair a person's life.So far this article has received 50 something responses from various readers. Some of these responders are of the neurodiversity movement. Once again, we see the same old tired cliches and completely disproven inane arguments that are so typical of neurodiversitites.Here are some examples:a person named D. Robert writes:She forgets that the largest Autism-oriented societies not only ignoreso-called high-functioning autistics and peopls with Asperger's syndrome, theyactively seek to silence them. \"Autism Speaks\", for example, refuses to allowany autistic person to speak; quite a funny situationAssuming there really were a directive from autism speaks to stifle the voices of any autistic person alleged or otherwise, how can they possibly do this. Do they have the power to use mind altering drugs on any autistic person that criticizes them? Do they have complete control of the internet so they can delete the blog posts of \"The autistic bitch from hell\" who at one point made the absurd claim that they only thing on autism speak's agenda is developing a test for prenatal abortions. When autism's gadfly called this gal on the carpet, she even changed her statement from only thing on agenda to ultimate goal, substituting one absurdity for another. Considering all the anti autism speaks' rhetoric on the internet and at ASA national conferences that I have attended, Autism Speaks must be doing a very poor job of silencing these people if this were the case.Neurodiversity Grand Dame Kathleen Seidel does not fail to weigh in:The spectre of neurodiversity activists bent on \"hampering children fromacquiring the skills they need to interact with the world\" is a strawman.Although there is certainly a wide range of opinion regarding the appropriatemeans to go about educating and caring for autistic children, and regardingthe meaning and/or desirability of pursuing a goal of \"cure\" or\"indistinguishability,\" I know of no one opposed to providing autisticchildren and adults with the services and supports they need to overcomespecific impediments and health problems, minimize maladaptive behavior, andachieve their fullest potential and personal satisfaction.Interesting thing about this statement, if anyone is producing a scarecrow it is Seidel. As far as I can tell she mostly writes criticisms of anti-vax  and fringe treatment things which I concede may be commendable, but what does it do for any autistic child? How has anything Kathleen Seidel written or done helped any child with autism overcome any impediments, health problems, maladaptive behavior or achieve their full potential. Nothing. She offers no alternatives for research on genetics and neuroscience that will lead to prevention and cure of this devastating disability. So yeah, Kathleen Seidel (or Dave) if you happen to read this, it is total baloney, by buying the domain name neurodiversity.com and advocating this misguided philosophy you are undermining the efforts of parents, scientists and others who seek real answers, so you are hampering autistic children from making progress. If you have any alternatives to research for a cure or prevention to be blunt, I suggest you put up or shut up.Someone who calls themselves \"the kitti\" offers these words of wisdom:\"We don't want to be cured, we want to be understood and given assistance\"does NOT equal \"we want your kids to bang their heads on the floor and eattheir own shit forever.\"I do not know of any neurodiversity advocate who endorses NO support orspecial assistance for people on the autism spectrum, or doesn't want kids tomake progress in life. But by sinking so much money and energy into cure,cure, cure, cure, cure -- what brain difference has anyone ever been able to\"cure,\" no matter how much people wanted it? -- it means that millions of usare not getting the help we need, especially adults and lower-income parents.And it's not just \"high functioning\" people who aren't interested in cure.Check out Amanda Baggs' blog, Ballastexistenz. She argues passionately againstcure, and she is nonspeaking. The overwhelming obsession with \"cure\" istantamount to telling autistic kids the world would be a better place withoutthem. Do you really want to go there?The notion of ND's not wanting kids to bang their heads on the floor and eat shit forever was addressed in my comment about Seidel.The comments about Amanda Baggs are equally absurd. Baggs is not a low functioning autistic. Some have even alleged she is not autistic at all. She at one time, was able to speak quite normally, go to schools for gifted children and attend a college at age 14. Comparing her to Connor Doherty or John Belmonte, etc. is absurd.Someone called silenced weighs in with the old Einstein Cliche:On the other hand, we don't want to cure Einstein from being Einstein.There's a lot of evidence to suggest that Einstein was on the spectrum. Hissocial limitations and inclinations towards mechanical objects and numbersgave him the extreme focus and perseverance and immunity to social opinion andeven his own job prospects that he needed to do the work that he did.We shouldn't try to over-cure high-functioning autistics or we could end upwith no Einsteins at all.These are misrepresentations of ND's about Einstein that are par for the course. Einstein had few if any social limitations. He had numerous friends was married twice and after his second wife died had multiple extramarital trysts. For those who want to say that it was because Einstein was a famous scientist, one of these marriages occurred before that and in adolescence Einstein had a romantic relationship with Marie Wintler. The interested reader can read my article on the subjectAlex Plank/Wrong Planet squeeze Katie Miller also weighs in, giving a comment on Kristina Chew's blog:In fact, we do so much work advocating for safe and helpful treatments and services. Why do people over-generalize? How can they call us mind-blind when they are the ones not listening to the words we explicitly say?My dear Katie: I listen to the words NDs say all the time, the calling me Joseph Goeble's, my mother being called a witch, domineering. Being cussed out by David Andrews who has the gall to call himself a psychologist who helps autistic people. It is you who are mindblind my dear. You seem to think that safe and helpful treatments and services are talking about how offended you are by the ransom notes campaign, or by the nonmalicious use of the word \"retard\" in the movie tropic thunder. How these things are helpful, I don't know. I am still waiting for a single example of an ND person advocating for any services, treatments, etc. instead of starting cyberwars on the internet or taking the \"you huht my widdle feelings\" approach.These sort of things are par for the course for the neurodiversitites. The same tired, cliched arguments that are so easy to refute. Andrew Solomon in his New York magazine article quoted Lenny Shafer as pleading to not write about ND or give it publicity. I respectfully disagree with Mr. Shafer. I say, do write about them, give them all the publicity in the world. They will use the same old tired cliches, people will see how ridiculous they are and they will look ludicrous and people won't take them seriously. However, I do wish they would write about me also and the other autistics who want to speak about the pain and suffering that this affliction has caused us and yet, unlike so many others on the spectrum are high functioning enough to do so.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/27/autistic_culture/index.html", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/undiagnosing.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/04/neurodiversitites-bizarre-responses-to.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversitites bizarre responses to Elizabeth Svoboda\n"},
{"date": " April 30, 2009", "body": "\nMuch media attention has been given to some recent studies on the genetics of autismshowing some abnormalities on chromosome 5. Whether this is a major breakthrough in autism or just some other studies that have provoked some hype and hustle is open to question.What is not surprising to this blogger is that Kev Leitch of left brain/right brain and founder of the neurodiversity autism hub has used these media reports to further a neurodiversity political agenda. However a number of Kev's contentions (and possibly by extension other neurodiversitites) are premature and unwarranted. Right off the bat, Kev makes an error and states that the article quotes the scientist as saying that if we could remove this variant as much as 25% of autism would disappear. Actually the number was 15%.Using the 25% number (rather than the 15%) Kev then goes on to ask the question 25% of what, the individual? Autism's more disabling aspects? 25% of the population of autistics? Kev then goes on further stating that it is time for some sort of bioethics debate. That members of \"the autistic community\" should have a \"respectful debate\" with the scientific community on how this new technology should be used. By autistic community Kev obviously means neurodiversitites, since this does not include me nor probably the vast majority of persons on the autism spectrum who are too impaired to comment on write a blog post on this subject. Once again we have the phenomenon of the \"royal we\" that Harold Doherty so frequently writes about. Also when used by a neurodiversitite the term respectful debate has to be one of the biggest oxymorons in history. Though there are exceptions to the rule, neurodiversitites rarely treat anyone with respect. It is always, insult, attack, be abusive and \"you are using this technology to try to destroy me\" nonsense. As I have written before, neurodiversity is an ideology that is only driven by hatred as well as the two Freudian defense mechanisms of denial and reaction formation. They rarely want a respectful debate.This is the age old propaganda of neurodiversity, genetic research on autism is only done with the intent of finding a way to abort autistic fetuses. What Kev and other ND's fail to understand is that genetic research is done with the intent of finding a way from preventing someone from becoming crippled and sick. Autism is a disease and a disorder regardless of ND denial. (I won't use the term disability anymore because I know that Janet Bain and other NDs will counteract that argument). If something could be done to manipulate the gene in utero in theory autism could be prevented and the individual would lead a healthy existence and not be incapacitated. This is the reason for genetic research. Or to perhaps find a way to cure autism if that is possible, but not for abortion.In fact all Kev has to do is read what Dr. Hakonarson, the principal investigator has to say in the article I linked to which will answer his question:With the new discovery, the hope is to identify children having these variants at birth or even in utero so intervention can begin early, Hakonarson says. Eventually, he says, the goal would be to create specific treatments to correct the gene variant.all Kev had to do was read this one paragraph in this article and it would have answered all of his questions.Of course Kev acts like this is something new. That these few studies have somehow elucidated some breakthrough which could cause such a great understanding of the genetics of all ASD's that the chance of aborting an autistic fetus or changing 15-25% of an individual's personality and makeup are really on the horizon. But is it new? For years, the mutation that causes fragile X has been known. Also known are forms of autism that can sometimes be transmitted via autosomal dominance in the case of tuberous sclerosis. Many other genetic etiologies are known. The genetic etiologies have probably been known for at least 10% of all ASD's for quite a while. So far the technology does not exist to either treat these individuals, abort them as fetuses or change their personalities.Kev is not the first to be confused on this issue. Temple Grandin and Simon Baron-Cohen have also proposed that autism genes confer some sort of advantage to a person or even genius. This is in spite of the fact that in all of the genetic studies that have been done on autism, there have been findings on X chromosomes, also autosomes on many different chromosomes. An abnormality on chromosome 22 which causes DiGeorge syndrome often is associated with autism. Abnormalities on chromosome 15 and many others have been found as well. There is no evidence that any specific autism gene is responsible for a person being a great inventor or saving civilization as Grandin and SBC often claim. I have written an essay debunking this notionRecently I went to a lecture that Dan Geschwind gave at UCLA. He is one of the people who apparently was involved in these new genetic studies. He seemed to state that one of the problems with research on genetics in autism was the fact that the sample sizes were far too small and because autism had many different genetic etiologies that they could not get a great deal of homogeneity. But with larger samples and more money spent on research it might be possible to get more homogeneity where we might be able to find a single genetic deficiency in a fair proportion of persons with autism. This could lead to better treatments or even prevention (again not abortion).Therefore for all of these reasons I think Kev's claims are quite premature and it will most likely be quite some time before a real debate is needed for ethical issues. However, I have no qualms about funding genetic research if at some point it will help us understand this horrific disability and lead to treatments, even possibly cures and preventions and I brook no quarters there.Ari Neeman and his merry band of crusaders at ASAN have called for a moratorium on genetic research until the issues that Kev brings up are resolved.Neurodiversity claims to be about human rights for all people regardless of their neurologic makeup. Well, how about the right to treatment or the right to have something prevent you from becoming crippled and sick in the first place?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20090428/gene-variants-hold-new-clues-to-autism", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2244", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/04/left-brainright-brain-is-probably.html", "title": "\nLeft brain/right brain is probably jumping the gun\n"},
{"date": " May 7, 2009", "body": "\nI see that the state of California Department of Developmental services hasa new autism report out. The media is putting their usual phony baloney spin on it. We see that the autism caseload has increased twelve fold in 20 years between 1987 and 2007. These reports are nothing new there have been two california reports previous to this, one in 1989 which the media made a big deal of and the 2003 one showing the prevalence of autism in the CDDS's regional centers by birth year.These data are used to justify the claims that there is an autism epidemic. Persons such as JB Handley, Mark Geir, Mark Blaxill and Rick Rollens have used this data to promote their crusades that autism is caused by too much mercury and/or vaccines and to promote treatments of dubious value such as chelation and Lupron therapy. Dan Olmstead and David Kirby have used this data to pursue their journalist endeavors though neither has a dog in the fight (i.e. an autistic child of their own or an ASD)On an interesting note, Rick Rollens stated that it was ironic that this report came out right at the time the state regional center was facing a $100 million budget cut in July. Is this really ironic, I wonder?-but more about that later.Perhaps a less superficial look at the data than the San Jose mercury and others present are in order.The report starts off with the following caveat:Note to Readers:The information presented in this report is purely descriptive and should not be used to draw scientifically valid conclusions about the incidence or prevalence of ASD in California. Numbers of people with ASD described in this report reflect point-in-time counts and do not constitute formal epidemiological measures of incidence or prevalence. The information contained in this report is limited by factors such as case finding, accuracy of diagnosis, hand entry, and possible error, by case workers of large amounts of information onto state forms. Finally, it is important to note that entry into and exit from California\u2019s developmental services system is voluntary. This may further alter the data presented herein relative to the actual population of persons with ASD in California.This caveat is invariably ignored by the media and by the sky is falling chicken little amateur epidemiologists who insist this proves their pet theory of a sudden environmental rise of autism.Looking at the graph we see the rate of growth was not constant. The largest increase in growth took place between 1997 and 2002 and then while autism admissions continued to grow in the regional center the rate of growth slowed substantially, showing that if there is an autism epidemic it has slowed for some reason and if the pattern continues the growth may plateau at some point in time. This means the growth has been slower since the last report came out at the end of 2003.There are 21 regional centers in the CDDS which serve various areas of California. The rate of growth is not similar between the various centers. We see by far the largest growth in the two Los Angeles area regional centers, the Lanterman regional center and the Westside regional center. We see that the growth rates are much slower in the various regional centers in rural parts of Northern California. This would have to mean there was something in the environment that was introduced in Los Angeles in the late 1980s that did not exist in the early 1980s but would have gotten worse starting in the late 1980s to the late 1990s and then was decreased in the late 1990s. These would not have existed in Northern California. For those folks who believe this is legit epidemiologic data such as maybe the age of autism web page or the above named individuals, they have their chance. Were vaccine rates different in Northern California than in Los Angeles. This would also seem to rule out the pesticides that some people thought were causing an epidemic of autism as they would be more likely to be used in Northern California than in Los Angeles. They can try to find patterns and trends. If there were such a pattern or trend I would think the MIND institute which seems to insist there is an epidemic of autism would have found it. I wonder why they haven't?On another interesting note, at one time Simon Baron Cohen and others proposed that autism prevelance increases were due to selective mating between computer geeks. He and some other people, at least at one time, seemed to think there were correlations between places that had a lot of IT activity and autism. The data in this report would seem to refute that notion. The San Andreas regional center which serves the silicon valley with more IT companies and other engineering concerns such as Apple and Intel ranked 9th in growth rates over the past 20 years, well behind the growth rates of Los Angeles.Looking at the growth in autism clients based on age we see that the number of people between the ages of 15 and 19 was less than a thousand in the year 2000 but more than 4,000 in the year 2007. If autism rates were really rising, this would mean that there was some new form of autism that had its onset at about age 10 or older that started in the year 2000. I wonder if anyone has an explanation for this phenomena.An interesting item in this report is a comment on the gender ratio between male and female autistics:Gender RatioThe ratio of males to females with autism in the DDS system is 4.6 to 1. This pattern occurred for all ethnicities and for all types of residence status. The preponderance of males with autism compared to females occurred across all regional centers and in all counties in California. This finding is consistent across the scientific literature. For instance, in his review of over 30 studies, Fombonne in 2003 found that the mean gender ratio of boys to girls was 4.3 to 1. Volkmar (2006) reported a ratio of 3.5 to 1, while the CDC (2007) reported a ratio for ASD ranging from 3.4 to 1 to 6.5 to 1 across 14 states studied.This gender ratio has shown a steady increase over the past 20 years. The rate rose from 3.4 to 1 in 1987 to 4.6 to 1 in 2007.There has been one school of thought that this seemingly scientifically proved premise is false. There are just as many or more female autistics as there are males, but because of the fact that girls are more social than boys and might have other factors that would preclude their diagnosis, autism in girls has been underestimated. The state regional centers are wrong, these August autism researchers who have published this data are wrong and the CDC, which showed various ratios across 14 states is wrong. This usually comes from neurodiversity proponents who are often very disproportionally female in terms of what seems to be the number of the ratio in the general population of autistics based on this study when I have questioned whether these people are a true representative of autistic people. This was also an explanation given by Ivar Lovaas and Tristram Smith for the inequalities in their experimental group and control groups of the M:F ratio. However, the people who claim this have not yet offered any scientific evidence to the best of my knowledge. They would also have to explain why similar ratios have been found in other developmental disabilities such as ADHD, dyslexia and stuttering in which the social factors would not matter as much.Also there have been changes in the cognitive levels of persons with autism. In 1987 about 80% of the autistic regional center clients had intellectual retardation. This number is down to about 35%. These numbers also parallel findings in the literature by researchers such as Eric Fombonne who have shown rates of retardation in autistic people comparable to the regional center clients. Also the regional center show a linear correlation between increased ratios of male to female autistics and lack of intellectual retardation. This means that the proportion of autistic females who have intellectual retardation is greater than that for males. This further diminishes evidence for the arguments that so many female neurodiversitites are in any way a representative sample of persons with autism.One of the arguments for those who believe there is a true rise in autism may be that the kids are coming into the regional center at younger ages and the children younger than 6 may not be able to have their intelligence tested in the same way. The fact these numbers have not diminished over time and nonretarded autistics seem to be on the rise would refute these arguments. So those who believe there is some environmental factor that has caused an increase in autism admissions to the regional centers would have to explain why this would just be an increase in persons with milder forms of autism and not the entire spectrum.It seems that a lot of these trends, the sex ratios, the ethnicity of autism (which I have not discussed here because I really don't find it relevant to anything), the increase in nonretarded autistics, the increasing numbers were given in the two previous reports that were done at taxpayer expense. These reports really present no new information. I really don't understand what it is supposed to accomplish.One possible explanation is that now that the regional centers are facing budget cuts due to the state of california now being in such dire straights, both due to the recession and to laws that require two-thirds of the state legislature to pass a budget and increased spending and many other factors was this report had a political agenda. Rick Rollens who has a severely autistic child started the MIND institute. He was a secretary in the state legislature at one time and has political influence. He lobbied the state legislature to do the MIND study some years back that was of questionable value and cost one million dollars to do. This study has yet to be published in a peer reviewed journal and most likely never will be. Perhaps this old worn out news and the media spin that has been put on it, was to try to take money from other programs in California and put it in the regional centers. Of course, this is totally speculation but one wonders about the timing.As a (at least at one time) taxpayer in the state of California, this concerns me greatly. Persons such as Mark Blaxill who have never lived in California and have not paid a dime in California state income, property or sales taxes can exploit this data for their own means. I don't think this is fair.I have a second cousin who works for the state of California who is being furloughed (sp??) from his job two days a month, just so California won't go completely bankrupt in these hard economic times. This has cut his salary by 10% while he struggles to support himself, a wife and a son. Governor Schwarzenegger has called for a special election on May 19 for a vote on ballot measures which he claims will help the state remain solvent if they are passed. This special election will probably cost California taxpayers considerable amounts of money and even assuming they are passed one wonders if they will give results in savings for California. I wonder how much it cost to prepare this report with the same trite and redundant information that was published in the previous two reports. The state of California is not putting on its thinking cap and we California residents lose. I had to be a victim of the shitty services of the state of California voc rehab department back in the mid 1980s. Perhaps this money could be better spent on vocational training for autistic people than putting out these inane reports which accomplish nothing.I take this back. This report will only give further ammunition to David Kirby and Dan Olmstead to make money off the backs of autistic people to claim it proves there is some sort of \"autism epidemic\". It will allow Mark Blaxill to give his proof that there is a true rise in autism prevalence. It will allow whiny crybaby neurodiversitites to cry \"foul\". You have insulted me by claiming that I am an epidemic, are train wrecks or toxic waste dumps. This will give them an excuse to project their anger in their new blog posts. To insult persons like me who just wish that a future generation of children can have a happier childhood than I had and a better life than I have had. So I suppose this report and the accompanying media hype will accomplish something.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dds.cahwnet.gov/Autism/docs/AutismReport_2007.pdf", "http://www.californiahealthline.org/Articles/2009/5/7/Californias-Regional-Centers-See-Big-Jump-in-Clients-With-Autism.aspx"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/05/new-california-autism-report-more-tax.html", "title": "\nnew california autism report: more tax $$$$ wasted!\n"},
{"date": " May 10, 2009", "body": "\nI have written the following letter to my congressman:Mr. Congressman:I am an individual with autism in my early 50s who has lost multiple jobs and is in the process of applying for social security disability insurance. I long for a cure and a way to prevent people from becoming autistic in the first place if this is possible.The reason I write you today is that I am concerned that the Combating Autism Act which congress passed in 2006 is not being applied in the spirit in which the law was originally intended. The purpose of the law and the subsequent creation of the interagency autism coordinating committee was solely to suggest ways that research dollars could be spent with the only intended purpose of finding ways to cure and prevent autism. This is not happening. There is currently a group called the Autistic Self-advocacy Network that often lobbies their agenda before the IACC. They subscribe to a philosophy called neurodiversity, which states that autism should not be looked upon as a disorder that needs preventing or curing, but as an alternative form of brain wiring. They have lobbied the government for a moratorium on genetic research. They also lobby for studies on vocational training community housing as opposed to institutionalization and even more trivial things such as the the nonmalicious use of slurs in movies or this ransom notes campaign in which language offensive to them is used. Genetic research may be our 'ace in the hole' for someday preventing this horrible tragedy to other children and enabling them not to become crippled and sick with autism.When congress was debating passage of the combating autism act a few years ago, these people protested the law and tried to prevent it from passing congress. After it was passed, they unfortunately took advantage of a law that they don't believe in to present their agenda to the government. I do not believe this organization should be allowed to present an agenda before the IACC. It is not fair to the organizations such as Cure Autism Now (which since passage of the CAA has merged with autism speaks) who lobbied for this law and other private citizens who long for a cure and prevention of this horrible affliction to allow the autistic self-advocacy network a voice at the table or anyone else who is using this law for other than its intended purpose of finding ways to cure and prevent autism.I was wondering if you could take some sort of action to prevent these people and others like them from testifying before the IACC. Or perhaps you could introduce legislation amending the CAA so that they would not be allowed a voice in the process.Also the combating autism act stated that one of the public members appointed to the IACC must be an individual with autism.  Stephen Shore, the current public member with autism, is opposed to a cure for autism.  I was wondering if when his term expires or possibly even sooner if you could instead appoint a pro-cure autistic as a public member.  Your help in these matters would be greatly appreciated. If any other american citizens happen to read this and they agree with me on this, I urge them to contact their congressman also and to try to do something about ASAN's actions and hypocrisy.   I have started with my congressman and I may also write my U.S. Senators and president Obama as well.  I realize this is probably about as effective as writing a letter to Santa Claus but at least I feel that I tried my best to do something in spite of the fact this blog does not get a large amount of traffic. To the \"Autistic bitch from hell\" and my other neurodiversity detractors. I have now written something else, so perhaps you can go ahead and once again make a donation to ASAN in my name. if you think your childish response to my letter to newsweek as well as John Best's and Jake Crosby's letters will discourage me from my activism you are sadly mistaken. Hopefully we can mobilize enough pro cure people to do something about your misguided agenda and if you keep your word you will have to keep donating to ASAN until you go broke.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/05/letter-to-my-congressman.html", "title": "\nA letter to my congressman\n"},
{"date": " May 9, 2009", "body": "\nWell autism's gadfly and hating autism and the age of autism blogs have decided that because of an upcoming newsweek article which will probably be favorable towards the ND movement,  that we believe that our side of the story should be told. I see that in response to this one of my favorite neurodiversity propagandists and hatemongers, the \"autistic bitch from hell\" is at it again. She calls me and Jake Crosby and John Best Ignoramuses and trolls in response to our blog posts asking our side be told.  She even goes on to state that John Best made a death threat against Ari Nee'man. This is a lie. Best only wrote a headline saying \"ask newsweek to kill ari nee'man\". He was not literally saying he would murder ari or even that someone should \"off\" ari. Best only meant this in the metaphorical sense that newsweek should not run ari's piece without allowing us who disagree to tell our side of the story. I want to emphasize that I am not defending a lot of Best's behavior. I do agree he goes quite overboard sometimes and I have suggested to him that he should tone down his rhetoric. I do understand why he has so much anger and contempt for these people and I certainly don't blame him for that. He has a son who can't speak and will probably have to be institutionalized when he is too old to take care of him and this is something no parent wants to do.These people seem to think we are being ridiculous in responding to an as yet unpublished piece. I do not agree. I believe a proactive fight against the ND movement is necessary. I feel that this should be nipped in the bud or at least our side can be told as well.  Only ND's would think this unreasonable. She also comments on how few people read our websites. Somehow I suspect that the traffic at age of autism far exceeds her blog.We see that the \"autistic bitch from hell\" has been confused before She was writing her usual misinformed propaganda against autism speaks.  She could not even get her most rudimentary facts correct.  She stated that the only thing on autism speaks agenda was finding a way to abort autistic fetuses.  After I pointed out how ridiculous she was when anyone could go to AS web page and see all the research they do which has nothing to do with developing a genetic test, she was so embarrassed by her faux pas that she changed the wording of her post from \"only thing on their agenda\" to \"ultimate goal\". She states that people should donate money to ASAN in response to our posts, claiming this is an effective way to ignore us because we are trolls.  Funny thing is she is responding, again she is confused. She claims that we are haters.  Yes, I am a hater, I hate autism and everything about it and I long for a cure and way to prevent it happening to other children so they won't be crippled and sick for life.  I do not hate the people who are afflicted with autism.  ABFH and other neurodiversitites are intoxicated with hate.  They stoop to insults and name calling and abuse. They call me a troll because I want to take a proactive stance against ND's absolutely inane agenda and I feel that my side of the story should be told.  She can't even refute any of our arguments with facts and has to resort to this personal attack and name calling.  It truly saddens me that since they have no arguments at all that refute my positions, jake crosby's positions and John Best's positions that they have to engage in such behavior.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2009/05/turning-trolls-into-stone.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/05/yet-more-vindictiveness-from.html", "title": "\nyet more vindictiveness from neurodiversity\n"},
{"date": " May 4, 2009", "body": "\nToday I had an interesting talk with my lawyer. As a few readers of this blog and the previous blog I had, Jonathan's journal on myother website may remember, a couple of years ago when I retired from paid work, I filed a claim for social security disability insurance. I had somewhat of a shock (no pun intended for those involved in autism long enough to remember Dr. Lovaas' old ways) to find that the main headquarters of the Lovaas Institute for Early Intervention was located in the same building on the same floor just down the hall from my local social security office! I wrote an essay about this irony. This was in about June of 2007. I had tests by a psychologist and then was turned down in October. I got a lawyer and filed an appeal, a year and a half later i have my hearing before an administrative law judge coming up. I figured there was a good chance i would not be awarded the money and that I could just walk away from this albatross that had been hanging over my head for two years. My lawyer wanted to see me in his office on Friday, but i could not see him until today (Monday). He informed me that he wanted me to take some vocational testing and have my former employer write some sort of letter.He told me that two years is nothing and that he was still working on a case going back to 1986. Also still working on someone's case for the past 12 years!. He talked me into appealing though I am now aghast that the process really goes this long. He might die or I might die before my appeals are exhausted.After a claimant is turned down by SSA and then loses at the level of a hearing before an administrative law judge, then there is a court of appeal in virginia where written statements are submitted. After this there is a federal district court to which the case can be appealed. Then there is what is called the 9th circuit court which is the highest federal court of appeal in the state of california that is just below the united states supreme court. I had wondered if any of these cases went before the u.s. supreme court. I'm no lawyer but from what I understood the supreme court is very selective about which cases they will hear. My attorney said that yes, the supreme court did hear these cases sometimes. He himself had never argued a case before the supreme court but that a friend of his who also practiced the same kind of law had. For someone who was an alcoholic, who could no longer work because of cirrhosis of the liver.I might do some more research on social security disability law and maybe edit this blog post with some relevant links but that is not easy for me due to my being handicapped. I guess this case did not take up a really significant part of my life except now it is because of the imminence of my hearing before the ad law judge.Guess I will be involved with this for longer than i thought. I guess I will have to try to practice some healthy eating habits and exercise more so that I can live long enough to exhaust all of my appeals.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/lovaas.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/05/interesting-talk-with-my-lawyer.html", "title": "\nAn interesting talk with my lawyer\n"},
{"date": " May 12, 2009", "body": "\nOne of the tenets of club ND (or at least some of its members) is that genetic research into autism is a bad thing because it would lead to prenatal abortions of autistics at some point.  In fact, the Autism Self-advocacy network has called for a moratorium on all genetic research just for this reason.  They have cited peer reviewed publications showing that the rate of abortions of Down's syndrome fetuses runs between 80-90%.  Therefore, they project that the same thing could happen with autism.  Some members of club ND (\"the autistic bitch from hell\" is one of the best known examples)  have stated that Autism Speaks which has a collaboration with the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange is seeking ways to be able to deliberately abort autistic fetuses. The technology to abort autistic fetuses does not yet exist.  There is no evidence that it will exist anytime in the foreseeable future.  This is particularly true for all cases of autism.  It is unlikely there could ever be a universal pre-natal autism test as so many conditions are labeled as autistic with a variety of different genes and genetic etiologies involved.  Some are due to autosomal dominance such as tuberous sclerosis.  Others are x-linked such as fragile X.  Others are associated with findings on chromosome 22 as is the case of the condition DiGeorge syndrome which is not uncommonly associated with autism.  Some cases are due to multiplex factors, i.e. the interaction of many different genes.Abortion for not only Down's syndrome fetuses but typically developing fetuses is a reality.  Ever since the supreme court's decision in Roe vs. Wade.  States have had a right to legalize abortion on demand.  If there is a state in the USA where abortion is illegal, I am not aware of it. I wonder how neurodiversitites feel about abortion.  I know that one, Joel Smith, has taken a completely pro-life stance.  There may be others as well.  Frank Klein has told me he is pro choice regarding abortions with the exception of the nonexistent abortions of autistic fetuses.  Though the question of abortion of autistics seems to be perpetually on the mind of the \"autistic bitch from hell\", I notice she has endorsed the Obama candidacy over McCain.  This would seem to increase the likelihood that she is pro-choice as far as abortion is concerned (excluding autistic fetus abortions which do not yet exist). Therefore, I wonder about other neurodiversitites.  Are they in favor of abortion under any circumstance (barring rape and endangerment to the mother's life which likely account for the smallest percent of abortions)  Do they favor keeping Roe vs. Wade intact and having Obama or any other president only appoint supreme court justices who will do so? If the answer is no, then why hasn't ABFH supported the McCain Palin candidacy rather than Obama when it was McCain who is pro life.  Why hasn't ASAN lobbied for outlawing abortion and having Roe v. Wade overturned? If the answer is yes.  Then why does a typical fetus who was conceived due to parents' poor judgement in using birth control improperly or not at all have less right to live than an autistic fetus or a Down's fetus.  If a law was passed outlawing abortions of only developmentally disabled fetuses, would this not be a violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment? Just wondering.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/05/pro-choice-neurodiversitites-possible.html", "title": "\npro-choice neurodiversitites, a possible dillema\n"},
{"date": " May 5, 2009", "body": "\nThe rumor mill has it that there is a forthcoming newsweek article written by ASAN president Ari Neeman. It is supposed to be published in a couple of weeks. I do not know if this rumor is true or not, but I did hear it from someone whom I consider a reliable source. John Best has also heard this rumor and has blogged about it. If in fact this article is published undoubtedly Ari will spew fourth the usually neurodiversity propaganda about there being nothing wrong with a person being autistic and if society would not put constraints on them they would do just fine.  I believe it is not fair for newsweek not to give me or some other pro-cure autistic equal time to refute Nee'man's nonsense.  Any person who feels the same way about the inanity of the neurodiversity movement that I do, I urge them to drop newsweek a line at letters@newsweek.com to tell them how they feel.  Or to urge them to either give one of us equal time or to kill the article.  I have written the following letter to newsweek myself:Dear Editors of Newsweek: I am a man in my early 50s with an autism spectrum disorder who heard a rumor that you are going to run an article written by Autistic Self-Advocacy Network President Ari Nee'man.Mr. Nee'man holds a point of view called neurodiversity which states that autism is not a disease or disorder but merely a neurologic difference.  He states that autism should not be cured and his organization has called for a moratorium on all genetic research claiming it will result in abortions of prenatal autistic fetuses.  Mr. Nee'man has Asperger's which was not diagnosed until the age of 12, prior to this time he had an ADHD diagnosis.  He is age 21 so the fact he had an autism spectrum diagnosis relatively late in life suggest to me that he is not a representative person with autism. I had a speech delay at age 3.  Because I am a generation older than Mr. Neeman I did not receive a diagnosis until adolescence but only because autism was not well known in those days.I believe that autism is a horrible disability.  I have no job and have had to apply for social security disability insurance to help make ends meet.  I think Mr. Neeman represents a very bad view of autism.In all fairness I believe you should allow me or some other individual with an ASD equal time in your magazine.  I feel that an absolutely one-sided view of autism should not be given.  Either that or you should not run the article. Thanks for your consideration,Jonathan Mitchell, an individual with autism. When Nee'man and Kristina Chew presented their nonsense on Good Morning America sometime last year, I wrote ABC a letter asking them for equal time.  They never answered my email and certainly did not grant me equal time on GMA.  So I am not anticipating that Newsweek will do what is right and what is fair either.  However, if enough people protest what ND is doing and ask that our view not be silenced perhaps someday the other side of this story about what a horrific tragedy autism is can be told.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://hatingautism.blogspot.com/2009/05/ask-newsweek-to-kill-ari-neeman.html", "mailto:letters@newsweek.com"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/05/asking-newsweek-magazine-for-equal-time.html", "title": "\nasking newsweek magazine for equal time\n"},
{"date": " May 16, 2009", "body": "\nWell, the newsweek article about Ari Nee'man that i warned everyone about is now out. It was just as I suspected. It starts off with a typical yellow journalism headline Erasing AutismScientists are closing in on the genes linked to autism. So why is Ari Ne'eman so worried? in spite of the fact that this has nothing to do with the gist of the article. The article quotes the questionable genetic research that found a genetic variant that occurred in both autism and in the general population, even though it was a variant that autistic people had more in common. It was not likely to be the major breakthrough in genetic research that the media ballyhooed it to be. Certainly there is no genetic test in the foreseeable future that will allow people to abort autistic fetuses. Certainly the comparison with Down's syndrome is not apt, as Down's syndrome is a very different type of disability than autism, with some Down's persons having much shorter life expectancies and a variety of health problems and congenital heart defects that can go with it. (though admittedly not all Down's persons).Interestingly enough, the article describes Nee'man as a master networker in spite of the fact that one of the cardinal symptoms of ASD's is an impaired ability to relate to people.I was also curious about the qualitative aspects of Nee'man's disorder as compared to mine and others who are on the spectrum. The article describes Ari at 2-1/2 in a dinosaur museum exhibit announcing, \"that's a pterodactyl\" At 2-1/2 I could hardly speak at all let alone say something this sophisticated. According to my parents and psychoanalyst I did not recover my speech until I was about four years old. So it would seem Nee'man never had a speech delay and at age 6 based on the criteria that was in existence in those days it is unlikely Nee'man would have been able to get any sort of ASD diagnosis. Therefore, the fact that he can represent autistic people is questionable.The article goes on to state that autism is not a medical mystery to be solved. So basically in effect they are saying no medical research should be done, even though this is the best hope for future generations of children who are sick or who may be born who become sick, though it may not offer anything that can be of tangible help in the foreseeable future. But we have to think about the future and hope that someday medical research can be done that will enable children on the spectrum to live better lives.Nee'man is quoted in the article:and he is pushing to make this happen for everyone on the spectrum. They should also be listened to. \"We're having a nation-al conversation about autism without the voices of people who should be at the center of that conversation,\" he says.So here we have an example of what blogger Harold Doherty terms \"the royal we\". Though Nee'man attempts to speak for all autistics. He does not speak for me. Someone who actually had a speech delay at age 2-1/2. Certainly he does not speak for Conor Doherty, nor other autistics far more severe than even Harold Doherty's son such as Sam Best or John Belmonte who can't even speak and aren't even capable of refuting Nee'man's nonsense. What is even stranger is that Nee'man is implying that he is not given a voice, even though the federal government allows Nee'man to illegally present his agenda before the interagency autism coordinating committee which grew out of the combating autism act which Nee'man and his friends fought tooth and nail when congress was debating its passage.The article quotes Nee'man as not being opposed to genetic research outright, even though ASAN's webpage has called for a moratorium on all genetic research in autism.The article then ends with a plug for the horrific no myths video that for some reason that is beyond my comprehension the Dan Moreno foundation financed.On a more positive note, even though Nee'man stated that the conversation is happening without us. He did not say that most autistics don't want to be cured. So the article was not quite as bad as I imagined it would be. I have already written a letter to newsweek I am not sure it is worth writing another one to them. The ND's of course will have a field day with this article and will plug it as giving some credibility to their agenda.One final thing I want to comment on is when I complained about the lack of equal time for people such as Jake Crosby, and myself who disagree with ASAN and wish there could be a cure for autism is the absurdity of the ND response. Some persons claimed that because Jenny McCarthy got exposure on Larry King and Ophrah, the NDs should get equal time and compared our complaints to that. However, there is one big difference. Jenny McCarthy is not autistic. She has not suffered first hand from this disorder day to day for most of her life the way those of us who on the spectrum who disagree with ASAN have. She is about 37 years old and autism was certainly an abstraction to Ms. McCarthy for the first 30 years of her life. Perhaps some day we will be able to have our say. I certainly hope so.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.newsweek.com/id/197813/page/1"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/05/ari-neeman-newsweek-article-out.html", "title": "\nAri nee'man newsweek article out\n"},
{"date": " May 20, 2009", "body": "\nI am still reeling over the responses of some members of the neurodiversity movement to my simple and factual statements that there are some persons with autism who behave in totally inappropriate ways, sometimes violently or making untoward sexual overtures towards people. I have talked about Kev's response to my post on Lisa Jo Rudy's blog in my previous blog entry on here. On Zach Lassiter's blog in response to Lassiter's reprint of my comment well known neurodiversitite blogger the \"autism bitch from hell\" had these words of wisdom to say:As for the grossly offensive comment that you first chose to reprint (and that I highly doubt you\u2019d have reprinted if the subject of the discussion had been any other minority group), I won\u2019t repeat any of its false and bigoted insinuations. Instead, I\u2019ll simply point out that research studies have established that autistics have no higher rate of committing violent acts or violent crimes than the general population (Murrie, Warren, Kristiansson, & Dietz, 2002; Barry-Walsh & Mullen, 2004).Scientific studies have not found that autistic persons are more likely to commit violent acts or violent crimes than non-autistic persons despite some media sensationalism of isolated cases of violence (Murrie, Warren, Kristiansson, & Dietz, 2002; Barry-Walsh & Mullen, 2004). Ari Nee'man has also cited these two studies that abfh talked about in this post to show that autistic persons usually don't commit violence.as previously noted on autism's gadfly ABFH has, in the past, either completely neglected to do any fact checking of her allegations or is outright deliberately misrepresenting factual information in her ND tirades. Also, one wonders about Mr. Nee'man's credibility given his ND bias.One of the most persistent criticisms that ND detractors Harold Doherty and the infamous John Best, both parents of severely autistic sons, have leveled against the neurodiversity movement is that Asperger's syndrome should not necessarily be included under the broad general rubric of autism. Now that I have read both the Barry-Walsh et. al. study and the Murrie et al. study this certainly rings true. Though both ABFH and Nee'man use the word autism to describe these two studies both of these studies deal specifically with cases of Asperger's syndrome and not autism. Here we have the first instance of misrepresentation of the two studies.So these two still don't cite any studies that deal with the entire autism spectrum and crime/violence. While we see that these studies don't deal with autism let's see if they show any evidence of whether or not persons with Asperger's are more prone to violence. The Barry-Walsh study does not appear to be online but I went to the UCLA biomed library and copied it there. the abstract of the study is online The study does not specifically address the question of whether persons with AS are more prone to violence than people in the general population, but rather it gives 5 case histories of persons with AS who have run afoul of the law and how their Asperger's caused them to commit these crimes and whether or not an insanity defense can be considered. The first case history is a man who committed arson who had a an obsession with fires. He set fire to a hedge and damaged property and he was considered fit to plead and received no jail time. Another case was a man with AS who had stalked and harassed professionals who had been involved in his treatment that he became obsessed with. He was found fit to be tried, was convicted but received no jail time. The third case was another man charged with arson. There was a radio station which played music he liked to listen to. When a religious station interfered with the frequency of the other station, he set fire to the radio station. He had no regrets for his actions and was puzzled why a fuss was being made.Another man assaulted his father, again this assault was precipitated when his father reprimanded him for setting fire to the lawn. He was not found unfit to be tried but the charges were dropped.The final case was a man who was a sex offender who would go to children and put his arms around them and say he wanted to take them somewhere and do naughty things with them. He also made an untoward sexual advance and then assaulted the person who rebuffed him. Some forensic experts tried to claim he was unfit to plead but the court did not buy this. He was conditionally discharged with court ordered treatment.Rather than showing no association between autism/Asperger's or violence as Nee'man and ABFH assert, the authors actually go on to state that it was aspects of their Asperger's that caused these five individuals to commit the crimes that they did and also none of the individuals expressed remorse at the crimes. None of these individuals was deemed unfit to plead. The authors go on with legal ramifications of the possibility of an insanity defense for persons with asperger's who might commit crimes in the future.The Murrie et al study is online for anyone interested enough to read it. They report case histories such as Baron-Cohen's report of a 21-year-old man who had a pathologic desire to stab his 71-year-old \"girlfriend\". They described other case reports of AS persons committing sex crimes and arson. Murrie then becomes similar to Barry-Walsh in that it describes six case histories of persons with AS who commit violence or crimes.Though no evidence of lack of violence among AS persons that ABFH and Nee'man puport are in Barry-Walsh, upon closely scrutiny of Murrie, we see that he reports a study by Ghaziuddin published in a 1991 issue of the journal of autism and developmental disorders in which the author perused various journal articles concerning AS and on this basis concluded that the rate of violence among AS persons was low, approximately 2.7%. This was a questionable methodology as it just relied on case reports in the literature and not actually going through police records or court documents or other records of crimes or violent acts that might have been committed by persons with AS. Also, the criteria for violence and for a diagnosis of asperger's that the author imposed were quite strict and according to a study Kohn (1998) if the authors had used a more inclusive criteria the number in their actual study may have risen to 20%.As is similar to Barry-Walsh, Murrie explores the possibility that these individuals amoral acts were a direct result of asperger's and these persons also saw nothing wrong with their actions.One issue of interest is that some of the crimes were thought to be due to sexual frustration.Murrie observes that clinicians working with Asperger's patient should be cognizant of the fact that social impairments coupled with the desire for sexual attachments could lead to illegal behavior in some of these individuals.Other than the mention of Ghauziuddin's study, with its questionable methodology, mentioned in Murrie, in no way shape or form do either of these two journal articles show any empirical evidence that persons with asperger's let alone all autism spectrum disorders are less prone to violence or to commit crimes. It would appear that both abfh and Nee'man have either not read the two studies they talk about or they are deliberately misrepresenting the facts. I don't see how there can be either conclusion other than these two options after reading the studies myself and reviewing the evidence.I am not saying that this shows that persons with autism or asperger's will as a general rule commit crimes or are sexually abusive-though I am sure the ND's will find a way to misconstrue this blog piece. The majority of persons on the autism spectrum are most likely law abiding and would not do the deeds of the case studies that are mentioned in these two pieces. However, my original contention was that there is indeed a subset of ASD persons who do commit these acts and this should be dealt with either by trying to find a cure or some other means. As far as I can tell ND again offers no solutions whatsoever or maybe they are just saying that autism acceptance means that these behaviors are okay and anyone who wants these behaviors dealt with is some sort of bigot because they want something done about them.I don't think it is helpful for ABFH and Nee'man to confuse asperger's syndrome with the entire spectrum of autism and I believe it is even less helpful for them to misrepresent the two studies that they discuss on the internet.References:Barry-Walsh JB et al.(2004) Forensic Aspects of Asperger's SyndromeThe Journal of Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology vol 15 no 1 96-107Baron-Cohen S.

{"date": " May 19, 2009", "body": "\nI have decided to make a belated response (better late than never) to Kev Leitch'sabsurd post defending the neurodiversity movement. First off, I am glad that Kev says he has a great deal of respect for me. I am not glad that he has chosen to misrepresent what I posted on Lisa Jo Rudy's autism about site, where he claims I equate autism with sexual abuse. This is totally untrue. I just stated that there are some individuals with autism who make untoward sexual advances towards woman due to their autism and that this presents a problem and asking why this behavior should be accepted. I never said that all autistics sexual abused people, just things I have seen from first hand experience, like a almost nonverbal man who acosted a job coach in an organization which many years ago i was on the board of directors of. Also, one member of our AGUA support group who would often make untoward advances towards females who would come to meetings, kissing them or touching them in inappropriate manners. He was asked to either come to the meetings with an aide in attendance or leave AGUA because of this behavior. He chose to do the latter.  I also did a post about an autistic man hitting a baby some time ago.  Why should this behavior be accepted under the ND rubric. I also see that the \"autistic bitch from hell\" who is perpetually confused about most everything involved in autism claiming on zach lassiter's blog that I am some sort of bigot for stating the truth and quoting some obscure study claiming the majority of persons with autism don't commit violent crimes in an attempt to obsfucate the truth.  Undoubtedly the people who did these behaviors did so because they had autism, no matter how much spin the ND's want to put on the matter.Since Kev has now instituted a registration policy for commenting on left brain/right brain which makes it more of a hassle to comment, and, on top of that, he has banned Harold Doherty and Billy Cresp (Lurker) just because they have made polite anti-ND commentary that Kev does not agree with, I am not going to refute his nonsense on the comment section of his blog.  I will do my best to do so here. First he tries to claim that anti-ND does not mean anti-parent but only cites ND parents as examples.  However, ND is basically anti-parent towards parents who wish to cure their children.  Parents are constantly insulted, called names and told they don't really love their children.  My own mother has been insulted by various NDs on various occasions.  It is not an inaccurate statement to claim that NDs are basically trying to bring back the Bettleheim era. So basically if you are an anti-cure parent or parent like janet bain (jypsy) who would just say \"no thank you\" to a cure if one were available then you are fine.  But want to cure your kid and incur the wrath of hell from ND's. He also says that the cure at all costs is a north american phenomena.  Well just a little over 200 years ago having a country which was the only country that did not have a king or a similar monarchy where if you said something the king did not agree with he would chop your head off was also a phenomena exclusively the province of the USA.  Perhaps our forefathers revolted against Kev's forefathers for a reason if the UK is such a backward place that they would actually embrace an ND philosophy. He then goes on to claim that NDs want to treat their kids by talking about GI problems and other comorbidities saying that because parents want to treat those and not treat the autism that means that somehow they are helping the kids.  Well when we say anti-treatment we mean the autism, the self-stimulatory behaviors, inability to do things, social problems, not speaking, self-mutiliation etc.  That is what we mean by ND parents not wanting to treat their kids, so the point still stands.  Kev then goes on to talk about his daughter receiving PECS and speech therapy.  So, does this mean that he wants his daughter to only partially talk and not have her speech problems cured?  What sort of nonsense is this?  Why wouldn't he want his daughter fully cured of her language impairments with speech therapy if he is using it, makes no sense at all. He goes on to deny that ND's are intoxicated with hate because of a few anti-vax people who happened to be abusive to him on some occasions.  So basically Kev's argments against ND's like David Andrews calling me \"mitchell-shite\" cussing me out and Cubed Demon and Phil Gluyas calling me Joseph Goebels and Harry Williams (AKA socrates) calling me lord haha and taking cheap shots at my celibacy and Clay Adams and Phil Gluyas saying abusive things about my mother is okay because two wrongs make a right.  That is basically the gist of his argument. He tries to deny that ND's with autism are different than the sons of harold doherty and john best.  He just claims that there is progress for these kids that won't stop and basically the only difference is that maybe conor doherty and sam best will grow up to be functioning adults who can function at the level of Ari Nee'man or the \"autistic bitch from hell\" who claims to be autistic.  But realistically what is the chance of that.  What is the prognosis of 13 year old kids who can't speak or have cognitive levels way below their age ever functioning at that level.  Come on, Kev, be real! Kev then tries to justify Harold Doherty's \"royal we\" phenomena by claiming because ND's are autistic that they can best share in the experience of someone like Harold Doherty's son or John Best's son whose problems are far more severe than theirs.  Well, unlike most ND's, I went to special education schools, I have had problems with celibacy, unemployment anhd the like, I had a diagnosis of autism in the 1970s.  Also, I am a male and a very disproportionate number of autistic ND's are females.  So, I have these problems and I long for a cure and I totally reject neurodiversity, but not much chance of my voice being heard in newsweek or good morning america to refute any of Nee'man's nonsense.  At one time, I was told that I was very severely autistic, no speech at age 3, smearing feces on the wall, the whole works.  I partially recovered, but far from 100%.  So maybe I have more of a kinship the the Conor Doherty's and Sam Best's of the autism world but maybe not.  But certainly ND's who are predominantly female, never were in special ed a minute of their life.  Never had after school tutoring for their handwriting and perceptual motor impairments have no common ground with the severely autistic people, so Kev's argument is really specious. Again, Kev wants to claim that ND's are not spewing hate filled rhetoric towards parents.  But that is pure baloney.  They try to bring back the Bettleheim era back by insulting people's mothers and they are constantly abusive to anyone who does not agree with their absurd agenda.  They even play the murder card blaming us for Katie McCarron's murder as well as possibly the murder of others as some of them have done.  If people did not want a cure Katie McCarron would be alive they claim.  Their main current spokesman, Ari Nee'man has even stooped to stating that autism speaks is morally complicit with murder. One wonders if Left brain/right brain's name should be changed to no brain.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2351"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/05/left-brain-right-brain-or-no-brain.html", "title": "\nLeft brain, right brain, or no brain?\n"},
{"date": " May 21, 2009", "body": "\nI recently finished reading an interesting book called Boy alone: a brother's memoir. The book is about a severely autistic man, Noah Greenfeld, written by his slightly older brother, Karl. It deals with the hardships of life with the severely autistic younger brother and some of the adventures of the boy and his brother and what family life was like growing up. There is also a time magazine article that provides excerpts from the book.Interestingly, three books have already been written about the boy by his father, Josh Greenfeld. The first of these \"A child called Noah\" was published in about 1970. Two sequels followed and then we no longer heard about what happened to Noah.The Greenfeld's lived in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. I grew up in nearby Brentwood and as a teenager I frequently would spend time in the Pacific Palisades as I had a few friends there. Karl would write about anecdotes in that part of L.A. so this resonated with me as I know the areas well that Karl speaks of in the book. (a bit more about Karl's anecdotes later)Karl Greenfeld in his follow-up repeats a lot of the same things that are in his father's books. He talks about the same hardships. The most interesting part is Noah's early experiences of being a pioneering patient of Ivar Lovaas when Lovaas' research on behavior modification (now called ABA) on autistic children was still in its early stages. He repeats the episode of Noah's food deprivation that was suggested by Lovaas in order to see if that was the \"fix\" that would get the nonverbal Noah to speak. It backfired with Noah upchucking bile. Karl did not mention what his father wrote in one of the previous book about Lovaas trying to talk Josh (the dad) into trying the food deprivation program again. Also, Greenfeld, sr. and Lovaas became somewhat friendly and went to see one of the famed boxing matches between Joe Frazier and Mohammed Ali. Lovaas was frank and stated that only one in 20 persons with autism make it out of their condition and that most autistics become nowhere near normal. Certainly this is a far cry from his claims in the January 1974 issue of psychology today where he claimed that he could make autistic kids very nearly normal as well as in the famed 1987 study where nearly half of the children in the experimental group were allegedly cured of their autism. Also in those days, in addition to food deprivation, Lovaas used harsh aversives such as spanking and electric shocks. He stated that the operant condition was based on fear and that he did not think Noah was afraid of anything or he would use \"his stinger\" on Noah the following day. Noah apparently was hit but not shocked.By the time Noah is 5 or 6 years old he is no longer a client of Lovaas. Lovaas now states that he has done all he can for Noah and that he is concentrating his research work on younger children. Noah still smears feces, scratches when approached and is completely nonverbal. Karl describes him as one of the children who \"flunked Lovaas\" which was a popular term among some parents of autistic children. Karl gives Jon Shestack and Portia Iverson's son, Dov, as another example of someone who flunked Lovaas.Noah's story does not get any better, Noah gets older, harder to deal with and the family has to contemplate institutionalization for him. Josh Greenfeld wonders why more money can't go into figuring out what the hell is wrong with Noah. Noah certainly becomes another example of an autistic disenfranchised by the neurodiversitites many of whom have asperger's. Later, not knowing where he can go Noah is sent to a placed called the behavior modification institute. In Josh Greenfeld's last book the place is called the operant conditioning center. In this place Noah is spanked, scratched and abused and then finally his parents take him out of the place.There is little doubt that the names operant conditioning center and behavior modification institute are pseudonyms for the behavior research institute which would later be named the Judge Rottenberg Center, which to this day draws controversy for its very harsh methods of shocks and spankings for dealing with autistic children. Its director Matthew Israel has never submitted his methods to any form of peer review and in one piece that I read in JADD it stated that he was expelled from the autism society of America for practicing clinical psychology without a license. The Behavior Research Institute left California in the early 1990s at about the same time the Hughes act, which outlawed aversives in California, was enacted.After leaving the behavior modification institute, Noah is institutionalized in the Fairview Mental Hospital in nearby Orange County, California. He spends many years there, still unable to speak or toilet himself. Eventually the Greenfeld's buy a house where Noah can live and hire a succession of caretakers, most of whom don't work out and one who even bites Noah and probably sexually assaults him. Karl also believes that in one residence where Noah lived he was sexually assaulted by a higher functioning autist.The book also details Karl's teenage adventures in the Pacific Palisades which I discussed above and talks about his chronic drug abuse and his eventually ending up in rehab. I won't go into the rest of the book as it might spoil it for anyone who might be interested in reading it.I enjoyed all three Noah books and the fourth one published by the son. After the first three had been published, I wondered if an autism book like this one could be published Nowadays. Attitudes towards autism have changed and we now realize the disorder exists in many more persons of normal intelligence than we realize. On one side we have the success stories of autistic children who recovered such as Christina Adams' memoir, a real boy and Catherine Maurice's story Let me hear your voice. On the other side, we have the books written by and about High functioning autistics claiming that autism is some sort of gift or the next step in evolution. I was rather surprised that Karl's book could be published given these circumstances of the drive for only feel good autism books and none of the harsh realities that some persons with autism must face.One wonders about Noah's flunking Lovaas. Was he in the 1987 study? If yes, was he in the experimental or lower treatment control group? Lovaas carried out his study between the years 1970 and 1987 so it is possible that Noah was one of the first subjects. Assignment of persons to the experimental and control groups in Lovaas (1987) was a function of therapist availability. Persons living near to UCLA had more therapists available and received the 40 hours per week of therapy. Those in the control group lived far away from UCLA so there was not the same therapist availability. They only received 10 hours a week of ABA and not 40 hours a week of ABA. Lovaas claimed that his original intent was to assign persons to experimental groups and control groups randomly. He was not able to do this because of parent protests. There was a high ratio of males to females in the experimental group. The ratio of boys to girls was about even in the control group. Noah lived in the Pacific Palisades, approximately 7 or 8 miles from UCLA. He was also a male. So if he were a part of Lovaas 1987 it would be much more likely that he would have been in the experimental group. If he was not a Lovaas subject as part of the 1987 study in 1970 when he first started Lovaas at about the age of 4, what other studies was Lovaas doing that included Noah and why wasn't Noah included in the 1987 study?These questions are interesting in light of the fact that though Lovaas received money from the NIMH to study the adult outcomes of his 1987 study's research subject he has not published them in the literature. We don't know how the supposedly cured half of the experimental group fared as adults (they are now in their late 30s and early 40s as is Noah).This also rings true in the published memoirs of parents such as Adams and Maurice. We don't know how they fared or will fare as adults. The oldest person that I know of who underwent Lovaas treatment who had a positive write-up was Drew Crowder who is mentioned in the book autism from tragedy to triumph. He was 18 at the time and doing well in college and he wrote a short piece at the end of his mother's book. In addition to Lovaas' neglect to publish his adult outcomes we don't see any parents or persons with autism publishing memoirs stating how much ABA helped them become functioning adults.Is Noah (who flunked Lovaas) who lived in institutions most of his adult life and now lives in a supervised home, unable to speak or toilet himself a typical example of a Lovaas adult outcome. I wonder.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Boy-Alone-Karl-Taro-Greenfeld/dp/0061136662/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242922591&sr=8-1", "http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1898322-2,00.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/05/noah-greenfeld-flunked-lovaas.html", "title": "\nNoah Greenfeld flunked Lovaas\n"},
{"date": " May 31, 2009", "body": "\nI see that Phil Gluyas one of my favorite members of the neurodiversity movement and author of the blog Mitchell's Gadfly, which is just a nonstop abuse fest of yours truly has given me an award as one of the three most horrible autistic spectrum persons of 2009. He also gives an award to Jake Crosby and one to someone named Joe Skipsey whom I have never heard of.He also has other categories, most horrible autistic parent, most horrible autistic medical professional. He also has an award for great autism spectrum person and great autism spectrum parent and great medical professional.I am particularly intrigued by his three choices for best parents of autistic children. His first choice Kevin Leitch is very interesting. This is a man who has a nonverbal autistic child and says that if there were a cure for autism, he would cure her only if she asked him to. Otherwise he would not accept a cure for her. Now, I wonder how is an autistic child who can't speak going to ask someone for a cure? David Andrews is another one who got an award. This is a man who had a child, got divorced and does not even live with his child. Also, this is someone who does nothing but use the most profane language imaginable when someone on the internet he does not like or does not agree with tries to engage him in dialogue. He also calls people abusive names in addition to abusive language. He has taken the cheapest shots at the disability of yours truly imaginable. One can only wonder what sort of a father a man who behaves in such a manner can be. He has also given the third award to Kristina Chew. A woman who has said on national television that she would not cure her son of his autism if a cure were available. Yet this same woman insists on asking the taxpayers for as much money as she can for her son as a direct result of the condition that she would refuse to cure him of. Also she asks for the best services possible under the IDEA law which she is not entitled to according to the u.s. supreme court's decision in the Rowley case. Ms. Chew hurts her own cause by publicly blogging saying she should get the best services. This is something her local school district could use against her in legal proceedings. If her son is not getting the services that she feels he needs and she desires for him perhaps she can only blame herself. Also, Ms. Chew gives her son dangerous psychiatric medications. She says that his autism is just fine but apparently wants to put him in a medication straight jacket due to these behaviors. Also psychiatric medications can be quite harmful and cause tardive dyskinesia so these drugs may cause permanent damage to her son as an adult.One of his choices for the greatest autistic person is Albert Einstein, someone who clearly was not autistic. I have written an essay disputing what Gluyas and other people say about Einstein's autism.Phil says that he won't give himself an award so I would like to return the favor and give him an award. Actually this will be the second award that I have given Gluyas since he has already been given the award of being the first person who has been banned from commenting on autism's gadfly. That is quite an honor as I have to be pushed pretty hard to actually ban someone from commenting here. There is only one other person that I have completely banned from posting comments here other than Gluyas.I would like to give Phil a second award. I give him the award of being the most helpful person to the cause of crusading against neurodiversity and showing the whole world why we don't need no stinkin' neurodiversity. Phil's obnoxious behavior, insults and assinine remarks that he puts all over the internet are showing how ludicrous the whole neurodiversity movement is and are showing the whole world how much on the fringe this movement completely is. Gluyas helps make people who believe the world is flat seem sane by comparison. The fact that he is still a member of the autism hub in good standing makes the hub look bad and by virtue the entire neurodiversity movement look bad.However, one suspects that no person could really be that idiotic in real life. I think it may all be an act. I suspect that Gluyas is really a pro-cure autistic who just wants to make the neurodiversity movement look bad. He couldn't be doing a better job. I am truly envious. Here I have an anti-ND blog and Phil is putting me to shame. Therefore I am proud to give Phil his well-deserved award of the person who is being most helpful at making the ND movement look bad.Correction to the above post:  I have been advised by Kevin Leitch that I was incorrect about his daughter's age, so I have deleted the part where I incorrectly state her age.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.philsworld.com.au/as/awards.htm", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/undiagnosing.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/05/phil-gluyas-gives-and-receives-award.html", "title": "\nPhil Gluyas gives and receives an award\n"},
{"date": " May 23, 2009", "body": "\nMost of us have heard the old saw if at first you don't succeed, well try try again. That seems to be what the well-known autism blog Left Brain/Right Brain is doing. After a very lame attempt on the part of the main author of the blog, Kevin Leitch, to justify the absurdity known as \"neurodiversity\", we see that his partner, someone who calls themselves \"Sullivan\", is trying to help save face. Like Leitch, Sullivan, also falls flat on his/her face in trying to justify this movement which has claims that autism is not a disorder or disease but just a different way of being.Sullivan starts out with the copout argument that neurodiverse just means different types of thinking and different types of brains. Sullivan starts out with the obvious that no two brains are exactly alike. Then goes on to try to distinguish this idea from being neurodiverse to the movement known as neurodiversity.He then states the tired cliche of so many involved in this movement that there is no set definition of neurodiversity and no organization. The first part of the statement may be true, there may not be any set definition of neurodiversity and different people have different takes, but there are some commonalities, like claiming a cure for autism would be bad and that the efforts of autism speaks and other similar organizations are thinly veiled attempts at eugenics. There are a number of organizations that subscribe to this philosophy such as GRASP and ASAN, though there may not be one organization. One of my readers, Marius Filipis (sp??), put it well: that pretending that it does not exist fools no one and that even though there may not be one brand of communism you can have Marxists and Maoists who may not agree on everything but have some underlying similarities.Sullivan then goes on to make this galling and outright hypocritical statement:And, just as we need to respect each other even though we come from diverse gender, racial, ethnic, cultural, and other backgrounds, we need to respect each other even though we think in different ways.That\u2019s not so hard a concept, is itSince when have neurodiversitites treated anyone with respect. They have cussed me out calling me \"mitchell-shite\", called me Joseph Goebels, insulted my mother calling her domineering and a witch. They have blamed Katie Mccaron's murder on those of us who want a cure. Ari Nee'man, now ND's very young but high profile spokesperson has not been above the fray stating that autism speaks was somehow morally complicit with McCarron's murder due to a temporal relationship between Allison Tepper-Singer's melodramatic statements about sometimes wishing she could drive off a bridge with her daughter and the murder of 4-year-old mcccarron by her obviously deranged mother. My friend brain researcher Matthew Belmonte has received emails from ND's calling him a nazi. When I had insults hurled at me out of the clear blue sky in the comments section of the whose planet is it anyway blog and I just did not feel like turning the other cheek that day, I was somehow accused of provoking this fight in order to deliberately generate traffic to my blog! There have been other episodes of rudeness and condescension towards me from other NDs. No, ND's who are respectful are the exception and not the rule.Sullivan continues with the old ND canard of criticising those of us who oppose the ND movement because someplace along the line we got the idea that they were saying autism is not really a disability when they mean nothing of the kind.Perhaps we did get this idea from someplace and that was from the originator of the term neurodiversity Judith Singer.Ms. Singer states on her website:Coming from this multi-layered background I want to encourage the development of new 'ways of seeing\" that depathologise AS as much as possible, which is why I pioneered the idea that AS should be seen as a neurological minority rather than as a \"disability\". But I have now come to the conclusion that balance requires us to acknowledge that that not all is for the best in this brave new world that the \"neuroscience revolution\" delineates.So yes, the originator of the term did see at least some forms of autism as not being a disability and perhaps that is where we got this idea that current ND proponents are claiming are a strawman.Sullivan then goes on to say that neurodiversity is about \"human rights\", another weary cliche. Those of us who want a cure for autism are certainly in favor of human rights and dignity for autistics. Many of us do realize that in spite of our desire, a cure for autism will probably not be in the cards in the foreseeable future. In the meantime, i think most \"curebies\" want to accommodate persons with autistics, help them in any way we can, though it is my personal belief that these options are quite limited. The desire for help and accommodations and the desire to fund a cure should not be mutually exclusive.How about the right not to be abused when we are trying to surf the web in peace?  How about the right for an autistic child to be treated or even cured when these options become available?  How about the right to do the research in neuroscience and genetics so these options will become available as soon as possible?  It seems to me if anyone is violating the human rights of those of us involved in autism it is people on the ND side.  I suppose another of the LB/RB's team of authors will make another excuse for neurodiversity. Well if at first you don't succeed.......... well you know the rest.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2374", "http://www.neurodiversity.com.au/lightdark.htm"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/05/left-brainright-brain-tries-again.html", "title": "\nLeft Brain/Right Brain: tries again\n"},
{"date": " May 27, 2009", "body": "\nI see that \"Sullivan\" one of the members of the left brain/right brain team is at it again. This time they are giving some reasons why the organization generation rescue should not be allowed to be on the IACC.In the more pot calling the kettle black department autism's gadfly must post its reasons why it does not believe that Sullivan and other neurodiversitites have any business being heard by the IACC.1) The combating autism act which the IACC grew out of was passed to preventand cure autismMembers of the neurodiversity movement have consistently opposed a cure for autism, claiming that a person can do just fine without a cure for autism, yet provide no empirical evidence of this whatsoever. There can be no way that an autistic person can ever function in society without problems unless they are completely cured. No palliative half-baked measures will solve this problem. There is the old saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure so if we could do research to prevent a child from becoming autistic in the first place that would be even better. ND's solutions of societal acceptance and accommodations just does not cut it in the real world. Ari Ne'eman and the ASAN have attempted to put their agenda before the IACC. This is in spite of the fact that while the combating autism act was passed, they and many other pro neurodiversity organizations protested this law before it was passed in congress and urged congress  not to pass it. I believe it may be illegal for Ari and friends to present their agenda before the IACC. I have written to my congressman but have received no response. I phoned his office and was told they were preparing a response. I will write a blog post if I ever get a response.2) They already have representation on the IACCAutism conference superstar Stephen Shore with all of his autism activities spreads himself even more thin by serving as one of the public board members. Shore has consistently opposed a cure for autism in spite of the fact that this defeats the whole purpose of passage of the combating autism act.3) Foreign nonAmerican taxpaying ND's are encouraged by the autism hub to write about the IACCKev Leitch has posted about the IACC on left brain/right brain though he lives in England and has likely never paid a dime in American taxes and the IACC plans on how to spend tax dollars. Petitions arguing for an ND agenda have been circulated by NDs. A number of persons signing the petition were foreigners who undoubtedly never paid any American taxes. I don't know if \"Sullivan\" is an American taxpayer or not, but he/she writes about this on a web page hosted by a UK ISP.4) They are anti-science in terms of promoting science that will cure and prevent autismASAN has called on a moratorium on genetic research in autism until the question of whether or not autistic fetuses would be aborted or not. This is in spite of the fact that at least some ND's are pro-choice in terms of parents who do not use proper birth control aborting the fetus and never endorsing pro-life political candidacies of McCain-Palin and trying to outlaw abortion and trying to get the supreme court to overturn Roe vs. Wade. They seem to believe that a fetus conceived by improper birth control has less right to live than a fetus with Down's or autism. As one of my readers \"Mayfly\" put it very well, they value the child's disability over his/her humanity. They don't want any science done that will cure autism because of the unfounded and speculative statement that to eliminate the autism from a person is to kill the person or change them into a different person because that is who they are.5) They are rudeThey have called me Mitchell-shite, Joseph Goebels and have called autism scientists Nazis.  They have insulted my mother just because I don't agree with their agenda.  If they were allowed to sit on IACC seats or continued to be allowed to present before the IACC they would just be shouting at people, being abusive to them and try to detract from getting any real work done that would help cure and prevent autism.  Which was the only purpose of the IACC since it grew out of the combating autism act. For these five reasons, I don't believe that members of the neurodiversity movement should be allowed to present any agenda before the IACC or have any say before the IACC whatsoever.  If they are American citizens and taxpayers they do have a right to try to repeal the CAA and to lobby congress for efforts to promote their agenda, but not through the CAA or by extension the IACC. Of course this is aside from the point of the utility of the combating autism act.  Government programs such as the war on cancer that was a product of the Nixon administration so long ago have probably not done a whole lot to end cancer and we still have people who die from cancer every year.  It would seem that the IACC will probably not accomplish anything for autistic people.  Hopefully Autism speaks and the autism science foundation can provide funding for good research that will in some point in time cure and prevent autism.  I certainly hope so.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2383"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/05/why-neurodiversity-should-not-be-heard.html", "title": "\nwhy neurodiversity should not be heard by the IACC\n"},
{"date": " June 4, 2009", "body": "\nI see that autism media darling and pop psychology icon Simon Baron-Cohen has yet another article in forbes concerning his work The article in part talks about Baron-Cohen's theories about autism being found proportionately more in families where the fathers are engineers and scientists and that assortive mating may be at work to produce autistic children. Baron-Cohen still seems to hold onto the theory that persons who are computer engineers can now meet their wife who works in a likewise profession and this is what may be in part what is causing the increase in autism. This is in spite of the fact that he contradicts himself within the same article stating that a lot of the increase is a result of increased awareness and better detection. He also goes on with the same old completely unscientific assertion that getting rid of autism would rid the genes for mathematics and engineering and that if we cured autism the world would be deprived of engineers and scientists. This is in spite of the research that was done in Israel not long ago suggesting some cases of autism could be caused by de novo mutations in older fathers with defective sperm. Also the research of Jonathan Sebat would seem to prove him wrong as well. Though I am loathe to use him as an example, Laurent Mottron, whom I wrote about in my previous post, has done some research suggesting that de novo mutations of some genes play a role in autism. As far as I know, there is no evidence from a peer reviewed publication which supports the assertion of SBC (as well as Temple Grandin) that genes for autism have stayed in the population due to evolutionary advantage or because they made good engineers or scientists. Not long ago I wrote an essay debunking Baron-Cohen's and Grandin's notion. These two individuals, one of whom is not autistic and the other who is not afflicted as badly as I am seem to think my suffering is necessary to society, a notion I take umbrage to.Baron-Cohen, who has researched these talents in fathers of autistic children, is now trying to do research on the mothers of the children to try to give some credence to this seemingly wacky theory he has. He wanted to use MIT as a laboratory to test these theories. Fortunately they had the good common sense to turn him down.There are a few things I have thought of just now that i did not think about before that are pertinent to this issue. I thought I would write about them in this blog post. I have been to a variety of autism gatherings and conferences and have met many parents. It is true that a few of the fathers that I met or fathers of autistic persons that I did meet (including my own father) were either engineers or physicists. Of course these were a minority of the fathers. Others had various occupations including dentist, lawyer, physician, food service industry, fire inspector, UPS delivery man, accountant, etc. So obviously being a physicist and engineer is not a requisite to being a parent of an autistic. I have met numerous mothers as well. Not a single one of them was a physicist or an engineer or worked in a related field. Interestingly enough my own sister who is the mother of two sons is a Ph.D. computer scientist. Her husband is a Ph.D. physicist as are his brother and his father. Neither of my nephews has autism and as far as I know there is no family history of autism in my brother-in-law's family. (I realize this data is anecdotal).I also wonder why a computer engineer would end up necessarily marrying someone who worked in the same occupation. My father, who was one of the earliest computer engineers met my mother at a party through mutual friends. My mother never worked in the IT field. My father's old boss, met his wife while they were both graduate students. His wife was pursuing a masters degree in romance languages in the humanities. One programmer my father worked with married a woman with a degree in English literature who never worked in an IT profession either.Though the Forbes article does not go into Baron-Cohen's \"geeks get lucky\" theories about computer people being socially inept and only being able to meet their wife only after more women went into the profession, I believe my examples disprove this. After all, my father worked with many men who were engineers and programmers during the nascence of computers in the 1950s and 1960s. Most of them were married and apparently they had no trouble finding a spouse.Also though MIT did not want SBC using their campus as a proving grounds, he could also look at the latest California autism report for some data. I wrote about this in a previous gadfly post He would see in looking at the growth rate of autism in the 21 California regional centers of the state department of developmental services, the San Andreas regional center, which serves the Silicon Valley, a bastion of IT workers, was 9th in growth out of 21, well behind the regional centers in the Los Angeles area with far less engineers per capita.In my last post, I questioned why Autism speaks would give half a million dollars to someone like Laurent Mottron. Now, in the same vein, I wonder why SBC gets any funding at all. Why anyone would take this man seriously. Yet he seems to get funding for his research, peer review approval for publication in various journal articles and attention of the media. As is the case with Mottron, I guess I will have to be mystified.Well soapbox mode off now.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0622/simon-baron-cohen-autism-ideas-opinions_2.html", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/sbs-bs-redux-department.html", "title": "\nSB's BS redux department\n"},
{"date": " June 2, 2009", "body": "\nI see that by looking at autism speaks' website that the good Dr. Laurent Mottron has received a grant in 2008 for three years for $448,827. That is nearly half a million dollars. It is just about $150,000 a year. Seems like a lot of money to me. I realize that some of the good doctor's research involves fMRI brain scans which I know are quite expensive. However, one wonders if this is money well spent on the part of autism speaks. How consistent is this funding with the stated goals of autism speaks considering what Dr. Mottron has said in the past?A look at the home page of AS' web page gives their stated goals:We are dedicated to funding global biomedical research into the causes, prevention, treatments, and cure for autism;Looking at an old post from Harold Doherty's blog we see that it would appear that Dr. Mottron feels that one of the main goals of an organization from which he has received nearly half a million dollars is nonsensical. One wonders why he was given this money if that is the case. One wonders what many people who went on walks for autism speaks with autistic children, thinking that the dollars they raised for research would go to help finding a cure for autism would think if they knew this man received so much of their money.AS goes further in stating some of their goals:Autism Speaks aims to bring the autism community together as one strong voice to urge the government and private sector to listen to our concerns and take action to address this urgent global health crisis (emphasis added). They seem to think that autism is an urgent health crisis.What does Laurent Mottron think of autism?:I think that autism is an example of a variation that has to be respected, first at an ethical level, but which does not have scientifically the status of a disease.From wired magazine on Dr. Mottron:From that day forward, he decided to challenge the disease model underlying most autism research. \"I wanted to go as far as I could to show that their perception \u2014 their brains \u2014 are totally different.\" Not damaged. Not dysfunctional. Just different.It would certainly appear that Dr. Mottron does not believe that autism is a global health crisis, that autism is not a disorder disease or possibly even disability but merely \"a difference\".Again it seems strange to me that an organization would give someone who had such different beliefs from their own a half a million dollars or close to it. One possible explanation is that autism speaks was somehow compelled to believe that Mottron's work could have some practical applications at some point in time as we see from the description of the last paragraph that discusses his funding:A more complete understanding of autistic individuals' strength in perception and visual reasoning may have important implications with respect to selecting and creating parenting, teaching, and workplace strategies that leverage these abilities.If this statement is accurate then perhaps the persons who donated this money to autism speaks believing that all of the research went to finding a cure, prevention and people who like them believe autism is an urgent global health crisis might be getting some bang for the half million bucks they gave to this man.  However, one wonders how the fact that at least some autistics do well on the block design subtest on the Wechsler, do well on certain other perceptual tests or memory tasks would help make parenting the child less challenging, would make it easier for a child to be taught academics and would make it easier for an autistic person to obtain and keep employment.  I am very skeptical about this.  One of the problems with Mottron's research is the subject pool is limited in that they are high functioning autistics rather than lower functioning.  He also uses a more proportionate amount of male autism research subjects versus females than are found in the general population of autistics.  Therefore, assuming any of his work had any practical applications he would have to acknowledge these limitations.  I realize, of course that this problem is not unique to Dr. Mottron but to a lot of autism research in general.  Research involving EEGs and functional MRI scanning necessitate a cooperative subject who will not make movements during the study and create artifacts that would interfere with obtaining legitimate data.  In Lindsay Oberman's mu wave suppression studies all the autistic subjects were high functioning males and this was likely the reason.  Dr. Oberman did acknowledge the limitations of her work in the body of the study.  Lower functioning autistics would likely not be compliant or be suitable research subjects for many of the autism studies that are currently funded. Assuming the statements from Mottron and AS that his work could have these practical applications one must wonder if there is not a trade off between autistic strengths and weaknesses.  For example, even if autistics do well on the block design test of the Wechsler they do poorly on the comprehension subtest.  This probably reflects a lack of social skills deficit that might be the result of mirror neuron damage.  This would certainly impair someone in the workplace who might throw a tantrum or tell the boss to fuck off.  This would get them into trouble with peers and social relationships or with teachers and impede the ability to learn in school just as much as Mottron's potential application of the enhanced perceptional abilities could potentially enhance these abilities.  Therefore rather than the research of the Mottron group being used to enhance strengths in these settings, the concomitant weakness of the autistic could in actuality produce a zero sum result. Dr. Mottron and his sidekick Michelle Dawson are now the darlings of the neurodiversity movement for the above stated reasons.  This is in spite of the fact that neurodiversity proponents have consistently maligned autism speaks claiming they are deliberately trying to find a test to abort autistic fetuses.  They have urged a boycott of Lindt Chocolates and possibly other organizations that help raise money for autism speaks.  However, they are not bothered by the fact that their idols are not above accepting half a million dollars from this organization they detest so much.  One of the main tenets of neurodiversity is that the brain of the autistic is not damaged or defective just different.  They even seem to believe that societal accommodations could solve a lot of autistics problems.  However, if Mottron had even a single example of an autistic person who was able to perform as well in school as a typical child, be parented as easily as a typical child or be as competitive in employment as a typical child without curing the brain difference they would be shouting about it from the rooftops.  There would be one post after another in the autism hub about it.  I have yet to see these posts, ergo, one must conclude that Mottron's work has not yet yielded any practical applications.  I am a cynic and will only believe it when I see it. I emailed autism speaks, asking them why they would award such large funding to a man like this, whose goals are so clearly different from their own expressed goals;  A man whose goals I must surmise are very different from people who donate money to AS and participate in their walks, the majority I would suspect have not even heard of the good Dr. Mottron.  They only replied that they had a formal review process in which each researcher's proposal was viewed on its merit.  One wonders what the merit is of Dr. Mottron's proposals given these statements, but I guess I will have to be mystified.  I will also await and see if any of the practical applications Mottron claims his work has will come to fruition.  I won't hold my breath too long though.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/science/research/grants/research_we_have_funded_basic_clinical_2008.php", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2008/10/mysterious-dr-m-notion-of-curing-autism.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/why-would-autism-speaks-give-laurent.html", "title": "\nWhy would autism speaks give Laurent Mottron half a million dollars?\n"},
{"date": " June 14, 2009", "body": "\nAs regular readers of my blog know, I am a rather pessimistic person as far as what I regard the prognosis to be for most persons on the autistic spectrum. I am also very cynical about all of the money that is being spent with the intent of helping persons with autism, particularly when they are children. Of course in the more severe cases of autism, the kids, while aged out of the educational system under IDEA at 22, they still have money spent on them in institutions and group homes.A few readers of this blog have commented on how I am always a critic, how my posts are always angry and I talk about what cannot be done for persons on the spectrum. I should offer some sort of solutions to the problems of autistics they say.What these people say may be valid, but part of the problem is that I don't really have much to offer in the way of any solutions or ideas that will really help autistics function in society. I do not believe that autism is treatable let alone curable. But is it better to spend money on treatments of dubious value such as various DAN protocols, ABA, speech and occupational therapy whose results are questionable, at least to me? Or is it better just to accept the sad truth and just say that while persons can try to educate their autistic loved ones to the extent they can be educated, to try to help set up some sort of supports, other than that perhaps nothing really can be done that greatly improve the future of those on the spectrum. I have brooked no quarters that I long for a cure and I long for scientific research on the neurology and genetics of autism that at some point of time will point to legitimate treatments that will help autistic children, hopefully cure them and in the very best case scenario prevent them from becoming autistic in the first place.It has been pointed out to me by some that these goals are very far off and not likely to happen in the foreseeable future. I will not be cured of my autism I have been told and it is quite possible no one else born in the last 6 years or so will be either. I must agree with these statements. It is true that the research that is funded by the federal government and by autism speaks and other entities has no short term practical applications. We can't just think in the long term. Autistic people need help and suggestions NOW. Last night an inspiration hit me and I have an idea how money might be better spent to help persons.Before I state my idea I would like to comment on how money is spent on autism. We have the DAN practitioners that charge a great deal of money. Some of them I have remembered reading have hung out their shingles without clinical training or license of any kind. A few of them who are licensed physicians have been disciplined by their state medical boards, giving the DAN protocols a rather unsavory odor. The lack of peer review and evidence of DAN's successful outcome has not been daunting to most desperate parents. the secretin saga is one of the most flagrant and indeed saddest examples. Thousands of dollars are spent on ABA and some parents have taken out second or third mortgages on their homes to pay for this treatment that gives a promise of a coin-flip probability of complete recovery or cure for their children. The lack of published adult outcomes, the questionable methodologies of Lovaas (1987) have not deterred parents from trying to obtain this treatment for their children. Also, a great deal of money is spent on speech therapy, occupational therapy and other treatments of dubious value.The Individuals with Disabilities Education act was passed in the mid 1970s with the intent of helping persons who are handicapped get the \"free and appropriate education in the least restrictive environment\" that they deserve. About 60 billion dollars a year is spent on special education, a 60 fold increase since the law was passed. This figure probably does not include attorney fees for special education litigation by both the parents and the school districts and the jamming of our court systems.The IDEA in fact has generated a variety of supreme court decisions. The Shannon Carter case is of particular relevance as it paved the way for any person regardless of their license, credentials or lack of to hang out their shingle and be an autism practitioner. This is why ABA is usually done by college students most of whom have no license, qualifications or credentials and are not even old enough to legally buy a six pack. While there is board certification for ABA specialists, it is not done by the government as is the certification of doctors, dentists and psychologists. There are no government licenses or regulations and the BCBAs are accountable to no one but themselves.Not only can special ed students be taught by uncredentialed teachers at taxpayer expense due to this decision, but apparently any aspie who was either self-diagnosed late in life or has a questionable diagnosis well into adulthood only after their own children were diagnosed with an ASD can apparently set up shop and charge desperate parents what the market will bear. I have been told that Michael John Carley who appears to have no formal training or qualifications is a paid consultant of some sort by the NYC school district. (Mr. Carley or anyone else can correct me if I heard wrong) Valerie Paradiz who also wrote about about her son and managed to receive some sort of diagnosis well into adulthood has hung out her shingle as an autism consultant and set up her own autism school. Ms. Paradiz is a Ph.D. in English literature with no formal training of any kind in autism whatsoever. Last but not least is William Stillman whom I have written about previously who self-diagnosed himself with Asperger's well into adulthood, has no qualifications whatsoever except a bachelors in education yet charges parents $100 an hour for phone consultations, though he is too ethical to charge for email consultations.  He claims he can know exactly what an autistic child needs after spending ten minutes with him/her. Are all these billions of dollars on autism well spent?  I do not believe they are, so I offer an alternative.  Instead of spending money on DAN protocols, special education, ABA,  attorney's fees, etc.  how about upon after receiving a diagnosis of autism at 3 or whatever age, the parents consult with a financial advisor.  Instead the money can placed in the hands of someone (hopefully not a Bernie Madoff type) who will invest it wisely for the child.  It might even be able to be invested in a tax deferred IRA type of account.  A smart financial advisor would be paid approximately 1% of the portfolio which would be plenty of incentive to get good returns on the investment.  The stock market though risky apparently generates returns of about 10% a year on average over the long haul.  There are probably mutual funds that are less risky but could generate a fairly decent return over the long run.  There might even be commodities that the savvy financial wizard could invest the money in. Upon turning 22, the age which they would be normally aged out of special ed services in the USA, they could receive this account and it would become liquid.  If they are too severely autistic to manage the money, a parent or other relative could be a trustee or executor of the money.  If they are mildly autistic, they could likely become wealthy, possibly even multimillionaires if the portfolio was invested wisely, even with a conservative financial advisor.  If they are lonely, plenty of people would want to be their friends.  If they are horny males unhappy about their celibacy they will have the means to hire hookers.  They won't have to worry about being fired left and right from jobs because they won't have to work.  They also won't have to go to the trouble of applying and litigating for SSI.  I do not believe the fact they never received ABA, chelation, DAN protocols, speech or occupational therapy etc. would make a difference in their lives or contribute to their being recovered from autism or being able to function better.  Therefore I believe my idea is the best that can be done for persons with autism over the short term until cure and prevention are found. Though I grew up in the 1960s before we had IDEA, ABA and the various autism treatments.  My parents spent enough money on psychotherapy for me with various therapists to buy a huge building.  This was in addition to the private special ed schools I attended that in those days were not financed at taxpayer expense.  Also don't forget the tutoring I had for my perceptual motor problems and fine motor coordination and handwriting impairments that did not help me at all.  Quite a bit of money was spent on that.  My parents could have spent a fraction of that money on McDonald's stock in my name in the late 1950s when MCDonald's made their IPO and I would be a multimillionaire now.  Or the money could have been invested in more conservative things and I still would have made out well.  I would not have had to endure the humiliation of trying to make a living and being fired so much. So for the readers of Gadfly who have complained I have no positive constructive solutions to offer, here is mine.  If you have something better to suggest than the above, I welcome them.  Good luck.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/better-way-to-spend-money-to-help.html", "title": "\nA better way to spend money to help autistics?\n"},
{"date": " June 15, 2009", "body": "\nLooking at the age of autism blog, I see that Simon Baron Cohen, that paragon of virtue of scientific rigor, is at it again. He is calling for a study on the prevalence of autism in adults stating:I agree we need a good prevalence study of ADULTS with autism spectrum conditions, and I haven't seen a study like this!Anne Dachel, the author of the piece featuring SBC, makes the claim that because no one has done a prevalence study showing similar numbers of adult autistics with the 1/150 prevalence that has been cited for children in the CDC's two year old study that this somehow proves that this increase is real-that it was caused by vaccines or something else in the environment. If this environmental trigger could be identified future cases of most autism could be prevented. This could even lead to a cure for autism. There are a number of problems with this argument but since AoA has a well-known reputation for censoring comments that are not in agreement with their rather narrow view of autism, I will write a blog post here instead.Actually I agree on the need for a good study on this issue IF FEASIBLE (with the emphasis being on if feasible) some time ago I wrote an article on this subject.  However, I had another reason for trying to find the so called \"hidden horde\" of autistic adults besides from settling the question of whether or not there has been a true increase in autism prevalence.  One other reason is that if we could locate autism in older people (let's say people over the age of 70) then we could perhaps persuade them to will their brains to science so postmortem autopsies could be done.  To date, there have probably been less than three dozen autistic brains autopsied or at least studies involving cell counts in various nuclei or whether an autistic amygdala or cerebellum is different from an age and sex matched control have been few and far between.  There are not really any adequate animal models of autism since animals can't speak or interact socially the way humans can.  Also, since animals can't handwrite we can't know whether or not they have fine motor coordination problems similar to what I have.  MRI's and fMRI's are very limited given the current state of the art in what they can resolve.  Also, studies involving fMRI's and event related potentials of the type that Dr. Lindsay Oberman and company do on mu wave suppression are quite limited in that they can only be done on a subset of persons with autism, usually high functioning males as the lower functioning autistics would not sit still for the studies and artifacts would confound the readings so that valid results would not be able to be obtained.    It is quite possible that post mortem autopsies are our 'ace in the hole'.  This could likely help us uncover the etiology of autism.  For example we know a great deal about the etiology of Parkinson's disease in part because persons with Parkinson's die from the disease so postmortem tissue is available for autopsy. I met pediatric neurologist Margaret Bauman and asked her why we did not know as much about the etiology of autism as that of Parkinson's and If enough brains for autopsy were available would it be possible to have that same knowledge for autism.  She agreed with me and explained that a large part of the problem was that persons with autism lived out their lives.  In fact the persons first diagnosed by Leo Kanner are probably about 75 years old now, so given current life expectancies in the USA, we are not going to be able to find persons whose brains are available for postmortem autopsies very easily.  If it were possible to find older people with autism in the same prevalence numbers that we have for children, this might be a possible solution to this dead end street for research. There is a problem with this approach here which I will outline. First of all, it could be argued that the burden of proof should be on those people who claim there is an epidemic of autism and in fact predicate various biomed treatments on just that premise.  Not to mention the AoA folks and others have urged the government to spend money on \"fishing expeditions\" to prove that vaccines cause autism with study after study producing the same negative results.  Perhaps they can show somehow that these adults with autism in the same prevalence numbers do not exist. In fact, Mark Blaxill, one of the staffers at AoA, has attempted to do just that.  He has cited two different studies.  One by Nylander that was done in Sweden in which searches of psychiatric hospitals were done and the adults with autism were not found.  Another study was done by someone named Bard in South Dakota in which a group of persons with autism was followed into adulthood and then upon looking for more persons with autism it was found that they missed only one or two persons with autism.  Blaxill claims that these two studies are irrefutable proof that there is no \"hidden horde\" of adult autistics. Last year at the ASA national conference I heard a speech by Bryan Jepson, practitioner at The Thoughtful House in Texas which uses various biomed treatments.  Dr. Jepson is also author of the book Changing the Course of autism.  He had claimed in his lecture that there were several studies done in the USA that had tried to find autism in adults with the same numbers as children, but none of them had done so.  I was fairly certain that no study besides the Bard study had ever attempted to answer such a question (excluding the Nylander study which was done in Sweden) so after the lecture I asked Dr. Jepson which studies they were.  He immediately clammed up and basically said he was not sure but the studies had been done and that Mark Blaxill was a good person to consult on the matter.  So basically the attempts to study this question have been very limited.  There is a probable reason for this which I will go into later.First, there are some problems with Blaxill's conclusions.  When I was in email correspondence with Blaxill five and a half years ago he cited these two studies to me.  Blaxill also stated that one point of evidence for an autism epidemic was that the increases in autism were geographically specific to various parts of the world.  There had only been increased prevalence in the USA and the UK but not other geographies.  This would be inconsistent with using a study done in Sweden since it is the geography that Blaxill is claiming is irrelevant.  One also wonders what the probability is of an autistic adult presenting at a psychiatric hospital especially if they are higher functioning.  One can look for gold in a salt mine but not have much chance of finding it.  So I don't think the Nylander study really proves anything.  The Bard study is also problematic in that it only covered a very rural part of South Dakota.  Looking for high autism rates in rural rather than urban areas has certainly been shown to be problematic.  This is borne out by the fact that the oft-cited 1/150 CDC study was an average between various parts of the USA.  The rates in New Jersey were much higher than the rates in Alabama.  Also, the various California reports have shown much higher rates of autism in Los Angeles than in rural areas of Northern California.  From this I conclude the question of whether or not autism exists in the same rates in adults as it does in people born in the late 1980s and later has never really been studied satisfactorily at all. One wonders about the feasibility of doing these sort of studies.  Most have heard the old saw about looking for a needle in a haystack.  This analogy might be applicable here.  In the two CDC studies done showing high prevalences of autism in children in certain ages one reason such high prevalence rates were found was that the CDC has legal power to force people to comply with surveys.  Most of the children found in the study with the average 1/150 prevalence were found in special education settings.  Because of the IDEA law, special education students will be motivated to get an autism diagnosis because of services, therefore this makes children much easier to find.  The California report seems to show that persons with autism are becoming much higher functioning as measured by IQ tests with the percentage of those with retardation and seizure disorders decreasing greatly.  I seem to remember Fombonne has found similar things in his studies (someone correct me if I am wrong). Persons over the age of 22 are aged out of the special ed services and after that point are either considered as recovered or as write-offs.  So, where are these adults going to be found?  How can Baron-Cohen or any other autism researcher do such a study and find the adults in the same number.  Particularly the many higher functioning autistics and those with Asperger's syndrome and mild PDD's who were counted as \"autistic\" in the CDC prevalence studies?  They will certainly not present to special ed settings as most of the CDC's 1/150 did.  They will not likely be found in group homes at the same rate as in special ed settings.  Since there was no IDEA when some of them were in school, they might not be able to be found or not found.  So, it might be difficult to prove or disprove the hypothesis that autistic adults don't exist in the same number as children.  Also, since they are not eligible for special education services, there won't be a lobby for federal funding of such a study and the CDC might not be motivated to do it.  This does not mean they are not out there and that they don't exist.  I know that I exist. I know that my friend Russell who I knew as a kid existed.  I know that the kids I was in special ed with in the early 1960s, some of whom today would likely be diagnosed as autistic existed. I say the onus to prove that these people exist should not be on me.  It should be on Anne Dachel, Mark Blaxill and others who think the way they do to prove that they don't exist.  I wish them luck in that regard, but for the above reasons I don't think they will ever be able to deliver. On the other hand if anyone does have an idea of how these people could be located so we could persuade them to will their brains to science so the autopsies that might prove to be so useful could be done I would certainly welcome those.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/06/prof-simon-baron-cohen-expands-comments.html", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/hidden-horde.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/where-are-all-those-darn-adults-with.html", "title": "\nWhere are all those darn adults with autism?\n"},
{"date": " June 11, 2009", "body": "\nI see that Kevin Leitch's assistant, \"Sullivan\" is at it again This time he is taking news that is a month old and distorting a number of the facts involving the efforts of John Best, Jake Crosby, and myself on taking a proactive stance by attempting to combat the neurodiversity propaganda article that newsweek published last month, featuring Ari Ne'eman.Sullivan gets many of the facts incorrect naturally. One thing he does get correct is that it is Stephen Shore was the one who \"leaked\" the information about the article. However, he did not leak it to Jake or Best, he told me about it. Ari sent me an email asking me how I found out about the article after John Best and myself had blogged about it in advance of its publication. As a common courtesy I emailed him about Steve telling me about the article. Steve Shore and Jake Crosby had nothing to do with Best's blog post. I am the guilty party here. I have no regrets though. I emailed Best telling him that I had heard the rumor of the article featuring Mr. Ne'eman or being written by him published in newsweek. I suggested he might want to write an angry blog post about it at some point in time. Though I don't agree with Best on a variety of issues, nor do I condone a lot of his tactics, I do find his blog humorous and I enjoy at least some of the shots he takes at the neurodiversitites, who have not only trivialized my horrible disability but have not infrequently been tremendously abusive to me because I happen to be a spectrumite who publicly wishes for a cure for my autism.I was not expecting Best to write a piece before the fact, I figured he might wait until after the newsweek article was published. To my surprise, I saw his article with the inflammatory headline \"Ask Newsweek to Kill Ari Ne'eman\". I read the article and decided maybe I should get in on the act. Certainly a proactive stance against this movement which trivializes the pain and suffering of so many is warranted. I also wrote a blog piece in advance. I knew that Age of Autism had a much larger readership than my piddling gadfly blog. Because I have given his work a shoutout, Jake has emailed me expressing his appreciation. Though we don't agree on a number of issues, Jake and I have become email pen pals. (hopefully Jake won't mind my writing about that). I suggested that he might want to also write newsweek a letter and maybe write an age of autism post, which he was glad to do as he feels the same way about ND as I do. So, it is incorrect to say that Jake was influenced either by John Best or Steven Shore.Sullivan also promotes the neurodiversity lie that there was a death threat against Ne'eman. John Best only wrote an inflammatory headline suggesting that the article be killed. He also wrote a comment stating though he was not advocating anyone go out and shoot Ari he stated that he believed that Ari Ne'eman's actions were a capital offense and that he hoped that Ari would be prosecuted, convicted and executed. I agree this statement was over the top, but it certainly did not constitute a death threat. There is little question that he did this to provoke and inflame neurodiversitites, knowing they would lie about it and help publicize his post. They played into his hands perfectly and helped publicize the post.The article also goes on to state that Ari Ne'eman does in fact believe that autism is a disability and that Jake was mistaken when he stated that Ari was saying autism was not a disability. However, Ne'eman was on national television with the caption \"There is nothing wrong with us\". He was also featured in New York Magazine where the author stated that neurodiversity believed autism was not a disability, but an alternative way of existence. It seems interesting to me that whenever someone criticizes the ND movement and states they believe autism is not a disability, they always come out and show proof of how wrong we are. Janet Bain's macro which she has kept saved for months or a couple of years which she displays all the people who state on the internet that autism is a disability who have ND leanings is particularly provocative in this regard. Yet, they never bothered to correct the record as far as the good morning america show was concerned, nor what Andrew Solomon said in New York magazine or any other thing that in any way gives them any positive publicity. I wonder why that is.An article written by Ne'eman about two and a half years ago might also give someone the idea that he does not regard autism as a disability.Ne'eman writes:We see the world in a different way than our neurotypical peers (neurotypical is a word in the autistic community meaning those of the majority neurology). This does not imply a defect, but merely a difference \u2014 one that we have just the same right to as those of a different race, nationality or religion.The belief was that anyone society labeled \"disabled\" could only go so far. Sadly, these misconceptions had the potential to become self-fulfilling prophecies. When the expectation is that people of a certain type can only reach so far, they are not provided with the same challenges and opportunities that educators give mainstreamed students.Particularly telling is Ne'eman's last paragraph:We should recognize what diversity of neurology has contributed to the human race and what it can bring to the future. Difference is not disability and someday, I hope, the world will recognize that those who think in different ways should be welcomedOne would certainly get the idea from this article that \"Sullivan\" apparently has not read that Ne'eman does not consider autism a disability. Sullivan also trots out the tired canard that wanting to refute what ND says by those of us who wish we could be cured of our autism is violating human rights.  Has Jake been asked by Sullivan if he is against accommodations or all the other things Sullivan alleges that Jake is opposed to? I think not. Also, there is the absurdity of Sullivan's statement that because Jenny McCarthy gets so much exposure in the media that we already have the equal time that we so desperately covet.  Though I am not sure what Jake's POV on this is, Sullivan might be surprised to find out that I believe Jenny McCarthy's point of view is also closer to Ne'eman's than is my own.  They are not dissimilar in that they both offer easy quick fixes for autism.  McCarthy's statement that it is all vaccines or some other known element in the environment and the fact that her son was allegedly cured of his autism means that everything is okay.  Likewise, Ne'eman states that because autism is a difference and not a disability, that once societal accommodations are made, everything is okay, autistics can do just as well as anyone else.  This view was reinforced in the Marino foundation's no myths video.  No, I want equal time to say, that things are not going to be rosy.  We need to do research on science and the genetic research that Ne'eman wants stopped, so that maybe someday small children and other children yet to be born won't have to live as cripples.  I realize it is too late for me, but that does not mean we should give up the fight to find a cure and a way to prevent this tragedy.  I have a very different message than Ms. McCarthy to be sure.We can also read one of the comments to the post by some character named Robin Henley who reports she has had \"run-ins\" with Jake.  She takes the condescending attitude towards Jake that so many ND's whose cages this young man has managed to rattle due to his age.  She states that Jake should be devoting more time to his studies and having fun rather than taking on the sophisticated issues of ND versus cure or even versus the AoA agenda that Jake helps promote.  Yet, Ne'eman is not much older than Jake.  He is also still in college.  Why isn't Ne'eman supposed to be just concentrating on studies and having fun rather than tackling on the sophisticated issues of autism self-advocacy that an immature youth such as himself takes on?  Seems to me quite a double standard. I believe I do have an interesting perspective to offer to Newsweek.  I do believe that what I (or even Jake or some other pro-cure autist would have to say) would be enlightening to them and their readers and I hope that someday the opportunity is given to myself or someone equally or more deserving than yours truly.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2479", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=2"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/left-brain-right-brain-no-brain-at-it.html", "title": "\nLeft brain, right brain, no brain at it again\n"},
{"date": " June 17, 2009", "body": "\nIn a follow-up to my previous post I would like to pose the question about some things that I find rather ironic. Ever since its inception, the organization autism speaks has been the favorite whipping boy of the ND anticure movement. They have all expressed their contempt towards the organization. They have claimed the organization is deliberately trying to find ways to abort autistic fetuses, they have claimed that their goal of curation would only destroy autistic people by turning them into different persons. Some of them have claimed some sort of responsibility for the murder of Katie McCarron and possibly others with autism. This was likely based on the admittedly dumb remark made by Allison Tepper Singer where she fantasized about driving her car off a bridge with her daughter in it. To borrow from Richard Nixon Ms. Tepper Singer gave neurodiversity the sword and they thrusted it with relish.Another absolutely bizarre complaint about autism speaks frequently made by ND proponents yet no one else is the absence of an autistic member of the board of directors. One wonders how they would feel about a pro-cure autistic being on that board. Would he/she receive the usual nasty neurodiversitite slur of being a house autistic or token autistic or quisling. If only an anti-cure rather than a pro-cure autistic should be appointed to the board of directors then one wonders why people should be appointed to the board of directors of an organization whose goals they totally oppose. I also wonder why not having an autistic member on the board of directors is a more important concern to club ND than the fact that as far as I can tell autism speaks does not have a single paid employee with autism working in their organization, not even as a minimum wage file clerk with a job coach. Autism speaks apparently spends money on huge executive salaries, private jets and possibly some other frills, yet can't help one of the many persons with autism who are unemployed make a living. This phenomena is especially intriguing in light of the autism in the workplace horse and pony show that AS puts on where they highlight employed (or in some cases semi-employed) persons with autism, talking about how urgent the problem of autistic unemployment is and how great these others were employing some autistic people. Apparently they take the attitude, it's fine if autistics work someplace else, but we don't want these incompetent, badly behaved people (from their point of view, not mine) screwing up our organization. How typical for those in neurodiversityland to miss the forest for the trees.Clay Adams, one of the most cruel neurodiversity cyberbullies and hatemongers, is apparently dumbfounded that I could be a pro cure autistic and write posts on this blog to this effect.  I must be a paid shill for generation rescue or autism speaks, there can be no other explanation for my behavior he has claimed. I must confess here that once in my life I did accept a free meal from autism speaks when my friend Matthew Belmonte who has his research funded by AS was in town and I met with him, Portia Iverson and some other people. Interestingly enough, I sat across the table at this dinner from the eminent Dr. Laurent Mottron whom I will write more about below. Dr. Mottron and I had a chat, he seemed somewhat intrigued by me and I discussed my job problems with him and he was curious why i was fired from various jobs and I told him about some of the issues I had; of course this is neither here nor there. I also was a research subject of Eric Courchesne's and received a small amount of money from his group for participating as his subject. I think some of this research may have been funded by CAN, the predecessor of AS. Now that I have declared these possible conflicts of interest, I will go on record that other than these trivial exceptions I have never received a dime from autism speaks or any other pro cure organization ever. I have never received a single dime from any of the posts that I have written in this blog.Paradoxically, one of the things that seemed to inflame Mr. Adams the most about me was that I had the temerity to criticize his idol, Michelle Dawson. He stated that he wanted to give me a black eye for this. Why is this a paradox? Well Michelle Dawson works in the group that Dr. Mottron heads who was at this autism speaks dinner and conference in Los Angeles, because he happens to be a recipient of this funding. According to the AS website in 2008 he was awarded a grant of nearly half a million dollars. For some reason Adams was concerned that I was on the payroll of AS or some other likeminded organization, but apparently had no qualms about Dawson's involvement with this organization. I am still baffled by this paradox.I wondered if Michelle Dawson had any involvement in any of the autism speaks funded projects that the Mottron group conducts. Yesterday I had my answer when I found out about the new study that Dr. Isabelle Soulieres recently published. Michelle Dawson was indeed a coauthor. This study was partially funded by Autism speaks!I wrote in the previous post about how the Mottron group may be putting a rather disingenuous spin with the media on this research so I won't repeat all of that here. However, I would like to print one additional statement that Dr. Soulieres made to the media about the implications of her newly published and completely unreplicated study.I hope the finding will convince people that autistics have a higher intellectual potential,\" said lead author Isabelle Soulieres, a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard who completed this experiment in Montreal. \"That way, people will expect more and give them more opportunities to learnI see that Estee Klar-Wolfhond, author of the Joy of autism blog, has given this study a shoutout in her latest post.  How soon will other neurodiversity autism speaks haters follow suit?  Since this study has just come out I suspect there will be more takes and more spins on this study and the absolutely unproven allegations that the results could help autistics learn better or function better in society.  How soon will it be before Soulieres, et. al. means that finding a treatment, cure or prevention will be absolutely superfluous according to the ND spinmeisters?  I suspect we will be seeing more from them in this vein. One only has to wonder how people who urge a boycott of Lindt Chocolate, Toys 'R' Us and other companies that help donate money to autism speaks can reconcile the fact that their idols Mottron and Dawson have accepted so much money from this organization?  How will they be able to reconcile their boycotts yet ignore the fact the organization they loathe so much has paid to help them spew out their propaganda that autism is not a disease but only an alternative way of being and that with the right accommodations they can do anything a nonautistic person can do.  The Soulieres study will likely be used as evidence of this, as was Dawson (2007) when it first came out. I can only wonder about these things and see what happens but I reckon only time will tell.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/has-autism-speaks-picked-up-tab-for.html", "title": "\nHas autism speaks picked up the tab for neurodiversity propaganda?\n"},
{"date": " June 16, 2009", "body": "\nIn yet another study that has come from a disciple of Dr. Laurent Mottron, Isabelle Souli\u00e8res, we see that Dr. Mottron is once again giving his $.02 to the media. Mottron makes the very optimistic statement:\"This study builds on our previous findings and should help educators capitalize on the intellectual abilities of autistics,\" says senior researcher Laurent Mottron, the new Marcel & Rolande Gosselin Research Chair in Autism Cognitive Neuroscience of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and psychiatry professor. \"The limits of autistics should constantly be pushed and their educational materials should never be simplified.\"I emailed Dr. Soulie'res, asking her for a .pdf copy of the study and she was nice enough to promptly reply with a copy of the study. I have done my best to read the study though I did not understand a lot of it.   I am curious as to how this study which shows a subset of persons with autism to be significantly faster at processing questions on the Raven's matrices than typical controls can be utilized as a real world application which would allow persons to use the results to help autistics learn or function better in society, which it seems to me what Dr. Mottron is implying. He and his sidekick Michelle Dawson also coauthored the article, though Soulieres was the lead author.On perusal of both the statement to the media, the abstract of the study and in fact the study itself there seem to be problems with this interpretation. First we see the initial sentence of both the abstract and the actual study itself which may serve as a potential red flag:Recent behavioral investigations have revealed that autistics perform more proficiently on Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) than would be predicted by their Wechsler intelligence scores. The study cites Dawson(2007) as evidence for this assertion in which huge differences were found between the scores of autistics on the Wechsler IQ test as opposed to much higher scores on the Raven's matrices. After the study was published Dawson seemed to think her findings should influence all public policy towards autism with the statement:I hope this paper will have the practical effect of making it less likely that autisics will be written off, as autistics are so routinely written off by autism advocates in Canada and elsewhere.Souleries also cites a study done by Hayashi showing that persons with Asperger's who were matched with typical controls on Wechsler IQ outscored them on the Raven's. The problem with this interpretation was that Souleries only included persons with speech delay and problems in her paper  who would have an autism diagnosis and excluded those with Asperger's so Hayashi would most likely not apply. Another problem is that a study Boelte(2009) has largely failed to replicate Dawson(2007) so the question is still open as to the superior of Raven's scores versus Wechsler in autistics. Though Boelte found that some autistics scored higher on the Raven's than the Wechsler, the effect was much less pronounced than the one found by Dawson. It was also limited to lower functioning autistics (meaning those with an IQ of less than 85). The subject pool used by Boelte was also different than those by Dawson-they were a lower functioning group. Had Boelte used a group more similar to Dawson's the effect of Wechsler's versus Raven's would likely be negligible. In contrast to Dawson's pollyannish statement Boelte makes a more guarded statement: in conclusion, the claim that intelligence has been underestimated in autism seems somewhat premature.\u201dKim Bodner who works in Nancy Minshew's group has also studied this question with high functioning autistics. She has found no significant difference in the scores of HFAs in the Raven's vs. Wechsler. I think her work has only been confined to a limited group of autistics, only high functioning ones. Also, I don't think her work has yet been published in a peer reviewed journal, but so far has only been presented as an IMFAR poster. I think her study will be published either at the end of 2009 or the beginning of 2010. While there is a subset of persons on the autistic spectrum who score substantially higher on the Raven's than on the Wechsler it would appear to be mostly confined to lower functioning autistics who would not necessarily even be in the majority of all autistics. Further studies by the Mottron group, Boelte, Minshew's group and others may shed more light on this question. In the latest study there is about a 6:1 ratio of male versus female autistics as opposed to the 4:1 ratio found in the general population. Souleries does not acknolwedge any limitations in this work. Of note, the autistics were also of normal intelligence with IQs of about 100, so whether or not these findings are applicable to lower functioning autistics is in question. Since they were matched with the typical controls they were different than at least some of the subjects in Dawson (1987) who had lower Wechsler IQs overall than typically matched controls. It is possible that the lower functioning subjects in Dawson (2007) would have to be excluded from the Souleries study due to the fact they would make too many head movements, creating artifacts on the fMRI scans. Another germane issue is the lack of discrepancy between the performance IQ scores and the verbal IQ scores of the subjects, an average of about 99 on the verbal portion of the Wechsler and about 103 on the perfomance. This might indicate these autistics were less impaired than other persons with autism such as myself who have a 40 point discrepancy between the two tests. My verbal IQ has been tested in about the low 120s and my performance IQ in the low 80s. I am good in arithmetic, general knowledge, similarities, high average on vocabulary and below average in comprehension. On the performance test I score in the severely retarded range in both the block design and the object assembly test (which entails putting together puzzles) which I have great difficulty in due to my perceptual motor problems. There are probably also examples of a number of autistic persons who have the opposite profile, relatively high scores on the performance test as compared to verbal IQ. I wonder if this research could be applicable to myself or those on the spectrum who conversely have a discrepancy with a substantially higher performance than verbal IQ. In at least one paragraph of her paper Souleries is more cautious about the interpretations of her work than coauthor Mottron: Although theresponse time advantage for difficult RSPM problems weobserved may reflect an underlying processing advantagein reasoning mechanisms enjoyed by autistics, additionalstudies directed at this specific question will be requiredto fully explore this possibility. In the last paragraph of the study unfortunately she makes a statement similar to Mottron's about how this work could be applied in the real world to help persons with autism. Not just the study's subjects who are clearly not an extremely representative sample of autistics, but all autistics, as she does not seem to acknowledge the limitations of this study due to the characteristics of the experimental group. On a more positive note, in spite of problems with the interpretations the author's claim have real world applications, some of the things in the study were quite fascinating (at least to me). Dr. Souleries talked about how faster processing times may have reflected the lack of neural connections in autistics that had been cited by other studies in various brain areas, resulting in compensatory mechanisms in other areas: Regarding possible developmental mechanisms leadingto the atypical autistic activity patterns seen in our study,clues may be found in recent studies of white mattermicrostructure [Barnea-Goraly et al., 2004; Courchesne etal., 2001; Herbert et al., 2004; Ke et al., 2008; Keller et al.,2007] and functional connectivity differences in autism[Just et al., 2004]. In autistics, Just et al., have observedreduced functional connectivity between frontal and parietalcortex in a variety of tasks, including sentence comprehension[Just et al., 2004; Kana et al., 2006], n-backworking memory tasks [Koshino et al., 2005, 2008] andresponse inhibition tasks [Kana et al., 2007]. Similarly,reduced functional connectivity between early visual areas(BA17) and inferior frontal cortex was found in autisticsduring a visuomotor coordination task [Villalobos et al.,2005], but this decrease was concomitant with increasedfunctional connectivity between the thalamus and its frontaltargets [Mizuno et al., 2006]. Given existing reports ofatypical connectivity in autism, there are several availableexplanations for our findings.One possibility, based on proposals advanced by Just etal. [2004], is that increased use of occipital brain regions inautistics reflects compensatory activity arising from anatypical neurodevelopmental trajectory, based on significantcommunication restrictions between prefrontal andoccipital regions. In this scheme, inefficiencies in engagingprefrontal mechanisms could result in the development ofcompensatory strategies and processing mechanisms moreheavily reliant on occipital and posterior parietal corticalregions. These compensatory mechanisms would have tobe as effective in supporting reasoning as the more typicalmechanisms relying on prefrontal function.......So even though I find Mottron's statement to the media to be offensive, this study, I must concede, may not actually be useless.  It may actually give some clues to how the brain in at least a subset of persons with autism functions and processes information.  The compensatory mechanisms of the occipital lobes in persons with autism as opposed to the deficient connections in the frontoparietal areas of autism that have been reported.  These findings also seem to be consistent with the mirror neuron hypothesis that Marco Iacobonni and Mirella Dapretto have pushed as an etiology in autism.  It may be similar to a blind person who has compensated hearing and can be prodigious in music or reports of deaf people being able to see more easily out of the corner of their eyes.  Whether it could actually have any applications for even a subset of autistics developing compensatory mechanisms could be used in the real world is another question, however.   So, Dr. Mottron, I would like to ask you.  What is the basis of this research, given all of its limitations, being able to help all autistics in educational and other achievements?  What difference will it make in their lives?  If you are going to make such sweeping statements to the media, why can't you be more specific?  I really wonder what the answer to these questions are.   \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122456693/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0", "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-06/uom-sfa061609.php"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/dr-mottron-how-can-dr-souleries-new.html", "title": "\nDr. Mottron, how can Dr. Souleries new study help educators capitalize on autistic's abilities?\n"},
{"date": " June 20, 2009", "body": "\nI see that by looking at john Elder Robison's blog that he has been picked as part of a panel to review research grants for autism that are paid with federal tax dollars.  Robison has written a book \"Look me in the Eye\" concerning his conclusion well into adulthood that he has Asperger's syndrome.  In the book he states that no cure is necessary for autism spectrum disorders.  It also shows him pictured with fellow, anti-cure autistic Stephen Shore, the sole member of the IACC on the autistic spectrum.  Shore was also part of this panel that reviewed grants for autism research subsidized by federal tax dollars. It seemed strange to me that the Combating Autism Act was passed by congress, which was lobbied by CAN (the predecessor of Autism Speaks) and other pro-cure groups.  The only intent of the act was to find ways to cure and prevent autism.  The IACC grew out of the combating autism act which would make decisions on how to best dispense research dollars on projects that would find ways to cure and prevent autism.  The law stated that one of the public board member of the IACC had to be on the autistic spectrum.  Because of his prolific conference appearances, Shore came recommended to serve on the panel in spite of the fact he has publicly opposed a cure for autism.  This seemed strange to me.  It also seemed strange to me that neurodiversity proponents like Ari Ne'eman and Katie Miller would be allowed to testify before the IACC on the taxpayer's dime about how terrible a cure for autism would be and how they have some quick solutions.  Now, the story gets uglier by the minute.  We see Robison, someone who was married, had a kid, worked successfully for many years and did not find out he had Asperger's well into adulthood being chosen to be on a panel with Shore that reviews research grants to be applied to autistics such as myself and others.   Probably 99.9% of us are far lower functioning than they are and at least some of us would like a cure. The Combating autism act and the IACC and the federal government program that reviews how research dollars subsidized by tax dollars taken from us by force that decides who and what get funded, and by anti-cure autistics.  Well another fine example of our tax dollars at work.  *Sigh*.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://jerobison.blogspot.com/2009/06/autism-review-is-done.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/anticure-autistics-review-taxpayer.html", "title": "\nAnticure autistics review taxpayer subsidized research grants for autism\n"},
{"date": " March 28, 2012", "body": "\nAs originally reported on the autism jabberwocky blog, The Los Angeles software company, Square One, is in the process of trying to help three different autistic people find employment as software testers. They have a pilot program in which these three people will be trained.This has been reported in a business week article.The article starts out with the annoying stereotype of all autistic people having intellectual superpowers and having savant skills and memorizing train tables and having Jerry Newport type calendar skills where they can tell you the day of the week you were born on.Square One's efforts, however, are not unprecedented. The Danish company Specialisterne has also trained autistic people to be software testers. Another company in Chicago, Aspiritech, has employed persons with autism to test smartphone applications.The difference lies in the fact that in socialist Denmark, which enjoys high revenue from Northern sea oil drilling, the funds were provided for this company. It is improbable that the U.S. government would fund an upstart like this. Aspiritech is currently a nonprofit company.Square one aspires to be the first company to make a profit from the labor of exclusively ASD software testers. Is anything wrong with this? After all, it's the American way we're told. This is what happens in a capitalistic society such as the U.S.A.However, CEO Chad Hahn states:A lot of software testing is done overseas by workers in India. The case Hahn makes is that his software testers will work for $15 to $20 an hour\u2014pay comparable to, or even lower than, that of software testers in India, but right here in the U.S. After all, he points out, people with autism don\u2019t have a lot of alternatives\u2014when they do find work, it\u2019s usually bagging groceries or sweeping hospital floors at the minimum wage.When Hahn was asked if he sees this as exploitive the article states:he doesn\u2019t see it that way. For one thing, he says, Indian software testers aren\u2019t exactly sweatshop labor; they make about $25 an hour. And if paying less makes the company able to hire the developmentally disabled in the first place, he doesn\u2019t see a problem with it.\u201cI haven\u2019t had one parent of an autistic child come to me and say this isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d he says. \u201cThey say, \u2018This is a way for my child to make more money than they would have made otherwise, and allow them to be more independent.\u2019 They worry, what is my child going to do when I\u2019m gone? And this is kind of a way out.\u201dThe comparison between Indian software testers and American autistics who do the same thing is moot. The standard of living in India is lower than in the U.S. The Indian making $25/hour can probably live like the $75-100/hour American.It's these kind of bigoted stereotypes and attitudes that it's okay to exploit people that help make things worse for those of us on the spectrum.As a person on the spectrum with no intellectual superpowers or savant skills, I find the stereotypes from the article offensive.The article stated that Hahn's wife does some sort of work with developmentally disabled people. Are the Hahns doing this out of the goodness of their hearts, or do they see some easy way to make money off the backs of those less fortunate than themselves?I wonder how much they understand about the problems of the developmentally disabled in the workplace. Are non-handicapped employees going to put up with bad behavior and social skills. Or maybe this is a test of Ari Ne'eman's theory that social skills in the workplace don't matter.Time will tell if this plan pans out for Square One.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/03/jabberwocky-of-day-businessweek-on.html", "http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-27/outsourcing-to-the-autistic-rather-than-to-india"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/03/software-company-stereotypes-those-with.html", "title": "\nSoftware company stereotypes those with autism and says it's okay to exploit them\n"},

{"date": " June 23, 2009", "body": "\nIn the special education law case of Forest Grove school district vs. T.A. the supreme court has rendered a verdict The question before the supreme court was whether or not school districts were legally obligated to pay private school tuition even if no alternative had been tried with the public schools. The student ,T.A., had attended a private residential school costing more than $60,000 per year. The issue at hand was a 1997 amendment to the IDEA stating that parents could enroll their children in private schools on the taxpayer's dime if the public schools did not offer a free and appropriate education in a timely manner. The supreme court ruled in a 6-3 decision that school districts are obligated to pay for private school even if no special ed services were ever rendered.For some strange reason T.A. was not identified as having ADHD and learning disabilities until well in adolescence. It was during his junior year in high school that his parents had taken him out of the public school in which he had apparently never received special education services in elementary, middle school, and well into his high school education. I have to wonder why the parents had not noticed there was something wrong with their son until he was a teenager and then apparently decided to send him to this residential school at a cost of more than $5,000/month.The New York times article goes on to state that the City of New York filed a friend of the court brief supporting the Forest Grove school district in Oregon. The amount of money that NYC spends on private school tuition for disabled children has jumped from 53 million to 89 million in only two years. I wonder how much more it will jump in New York and in other cities because of the supreme court's decision.David Souter, a more rational head on the U.S. Supreme court and one of the three dissenters of the ruling ,stated the implications well:\u201cSpecial education can be immensely expensive, amounting to tens of billions of dollars annually and as much as 20 percent of public schools\u2019 general operating budgets,\u201d Justice Souter wrote. \u201cGiven the burden of private school placement, it makes good sense to require parents to try to devise a satisfactory alternative within the public schools.\u201dIn light of the supreme court's decision in the Shannon Carter case saying that taxpayers were required to pick up the tab for uncredentialed personnel teaching disabled children, one has to think about the implications. It will only mean private special education schools of dubious value will be an even bigger growth industry than ever before.Apparently anyone who decides they have autism or Asperger's syndrome well into adulthood can start their own private school or become a consultant without licensing or credentialing of any kind. one example of this phenomena is valerie paradiz formerly an instructor at Bard College and author of the book, Elijah's cup, dealing with her son's asperger's syndrome then her own realization well into adulthood that she herself was on the spectrum in spite of being a college professor and a one time wife and mother. Ms. Paradiz has a Ph.D. in English literature with no training or formal credentials whatsoever in the field of autism or autism education. This did not stop her from pursuing a career as an autism consultant and apparently opening up her own private special ed school for persons on the autism spectrum. How many more Valerie Paradizs and $100 an hour phone consultation William Stillmans will come out of the woodwork with this new decision?The Carter decision also set the precedent for a New York court decision Malkowitz v. DeBuono which paved the way for uncredentialed, untrained Lovaas/ABA therapists to practice at taxpayer expense.These court decisions paved the way for allowing ABA to become a cottage industry, at least in the USA, allowing 20-year-old college students with no training, experience whatsoever to come to people's homes and be Lovaas therapists.Because of this decision and T.A.'s parents' decision to wait until he was well into adolescence to send him to this exorbitantly expensive private school, he will probably have the taxpayers picking up the tab for all sorts of special ed goodies until he is aged out of the system at 21 or 22. How many other kids will this affect? Again, I do question what difference these private schools will make in their lives as well as the very expensive ABA therapies. How much will it really help them? Perhaps the money would be better spent using a suggestion I made in a previous gadfly postI wonder how much money will be lost in property tax revenues from the various cities. How much will the education of regular education students suffer? Will this mean that houses get burglarized and burned down because there is no money left in municipality's budgets for police and fire protection after they are decimated with all the children who will be able to more easily attend private special ed schools on the taxpayer's dime? Then, if IDEA is ever fully funded with the federal government picking up 40% of the costs we have to wonder where all the money for federal expenditures will come from after they end up applying for social security and section 8 housing as adults after these private schools have not helped them function better in society at all.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/education/23special.html?ref=education", "http://www.valerieparadiz.com/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/supreme-court-allows-special-educators.html", "title": "\nsupreme court allows special educators to gouge families\n"},
{"date": " June 23, 2009", "body": "\nI see that the NIMH hasfunded a new study on the use of transmagnetic stimulation in conjunction with ABA. TMS as it is called is the use of a tool that generates a magnetic field around a given brain area that will either knock it out or enhance it. It can be used to assess function in the area depending on what affects it has. It also has interest as a possible therapeutic tool for conditions such as depression and autism. I do not think I have to explain what ABA is to most of my readers. The grant from the NIMH is $900,000 given to researcher Manual Casanova. Casanova has done research on minicolumns which are groups of brain cells that are abnormally small in autism. The small minicolumns are believed to result in lack of inhibition of certain actions. Using TMS Casanova believes that he can artificially stimulate these inhibitory activities that the small minicolumns are not able to produce. Apparently some believe that this technique used in conjunction with ABA will produce some sort of results in autism.One of the problems that I have with this is that Lovaas(the most celebrated of ABA practitioners and researchers) has already received quite a bit of money from the NIMH to study the adult outcomes of the participants of his subjects in his renowned 1987 study where he alleges a coin-flip probability of normal functioning in nearly half of the autistic children who as research subjects received 40 hours a week of ABA. I don't know how much money the NIMH awarded him to study these as yet still unpublished adult outcomes; however, this current study is running a tab of approximately $900,000. I don't feel that the taxpayers should foot the bill for more research into ABA therapy  until we get the true story of what happened to those supposedly recovered autistic adults who are now in their late 30's, early 40's. Did they graduate college, did they become physicians, lawyers, dentists or engineers? Did they marry? Did their improved IQ scores remain stable? According to what little I have been able to gauge from my correspondence with Lovaas heir-apparent Tristram Smith, there were other psychologic tests administered to these subjects as adults as well.Another problem is apparently only a pilot study has been done with TMS in which Casanova has gotten some results in a small group of autistic children. We still don't know what its effects are or lack of them is in autistic with just the TMS alone and no ABA other than these very preliminary findings. Of course, in a well-designed study we might be able to get an idea of which treatment affected what change.Confounding variables were also dealt with in Lovaas(1987). What was found, however, is of chagrin to most behaviorists. Lovaas' work found that the active ingredient in ABA was the contingent use of aversives, such as hitting, slaps, water in the face and even in some cases electric shock. Without the aversives Lovaas (1987) would not have its marketing points and ABA never would have been able to achieve its current status as a cottage industry. This is in spite of the fact that the Hughes act outlawed aversives on developmentally disabled children in 1991. Therefore in jurisdictions such as my home state of California where aversives are a no-no, ABA is dishonestly marketed. Lovaas claimed in a rebuttal to his detractors written about 8 years ago or so that he had found new methods that made the use of aversives obsolete. If this is the case, to the best of my knowledge, he has never presented any evidence of this in a peer reviewed journal-the same fate that has become of his apparently NIMH funded aborted study of the adult outcomes of these children.Transcranial magnetic stimulation may or may not be a state of the art treatment that will produce pie-in-the-sky rather than shit-from-the-sewer results in persons with autism. Interestingly enough, John Elder Robison, who wrote the bestseller Look Me in the Eye has gotten into the act This is in spite of the fact that on page 5 of his book he states that Asperger's is not a disease but a different way of being. He went on to state there was no cure and no need for one. Yet now he seems to feel the need to be a guinea pig in TMS research stating:\"I knew how much I had struggled as a young person - not knowing, being called 'retard' or 'freak.' This might help young people.\"A possible complication from TMS is that it can induce seizure disorders.  But supposedly, technology has improved and people have learned how to use this effectively enough to avoid giving someone a seizure. Though this might be a good line of research at some point in time, one problem I have is that not enough is known about the etiology of the brain dysfunction responsible for ASD's.  I suppose if Dr. Casanova were available to me he could explain the rationale to me based on what is known of the neurophysiology of autism aside from the work he has done on minicolumns.  It may be that the autistic brain has various things wrong with it in various regions spread out diffusely within the brain.  There may be an elaborate mirror neuron system with a variety of connections and it might be hard to find anything that is wrong.  I guess Dr. Casanova being the recipient of the grant may have to show some evidence that this is a promising line of research and possible treatment of autism.  Of course the same cannot be said of Dr. Lovaas and his cronies.  If the work is replicated by a researcher besides Dr. Casanova perhaps studies could be made of TMS in lieu of ABA rather than as an adjunct with ABA.  As regular gadfly readers (of which I know there are not very many)I am a cynic when it comes to anything in autism research or the new autism treatments that come up not infrequently as variable flavors of the month.  This work may or may not yield some promise for autistic people, but it may not generate anything other than a bitter harvest for years or decades to come.  Also work in neurofeedback such as what Jaime Pineda and Lindsay Oberman and their ilk are doing may also be promising avenues.   This work may generate figurative diamonds in the rough at some point in time.  Much work needs to be done though.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://php.louisville.edu/advancement/ocm/news/release.php?relid=1199", "http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/family/articles/2009/06/08/magnetic_stimulation_helps_researchers_trigger_responses_in_autistic_brain/?page=1"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/gadflys-take-on-new-abatms-study.html", "title": "\nGadfly's take on new ABA+TMS study\n"},
{"date": " July 8, 2009", "body": "\nOne of the hottest issues on the burner in regards to autism is health insurance reform. The heavily capitalized organization Autism Speaks has been in the forefront in this venture. Regular readers of gadfly have seen my previous post regarding health insurance reform in which claims were made that this would help autistic become \"functioning adults\" and the citing of the nearly 50% recovery rate reported in Lovaas(1987). This is in spite of the fact that Lovaas and company have been paid handsomely by their ability to use NIMH funding as a proverbial ATM machine and get funding to publish the adult outcomes of their subjects in a peer review journal and the fact that they have failed to do so. We also have the phony/baloney cost-benefit analysis presented by Jacobson et. al. claiming that the potential earnings of autistic kids and their ability to be kept off the dole will far exceed the costs of ABA. The informal presentations of the adult outcomes at a conference were presented as evidence. No matter they either did not pass peer review or the outcomes were actually less than stellar so they were not published.  No matter the absurdity of Jacobson and company assuming that interest rates will remain constant for decades and an inflation rate of zero for decades in their extremely sophomoric analysis. Not to mention the fact this assumes the 40 hour a week regimen with aversives that have been outlawed in many jurisdictions, along with clinic based ABA, as opposed to the workshop based ABA that is often used involving less hours, and lesser trained personnel that are paid for at taxpayer expense under IDEA. Lovaas(1987) used the clinic based ABA with highly trained personnel and the 40 hour a week setup for the experimental treatment group.I realize I am rehasing some old issues I have written about before but it relates to the latest abominable campaign by the petty propagandists who run the show at Autism Speaks. I have already written about the despicable dog and pony show put on by autism speaks in terms of trying to encourage employers to hire autistics, yet not employing a single person with autism in their organization not even as a minimum wage file clerk with a job coach.Sigmund Freud said to love and to work are the cornerstones of our humanity. So, it should certainly not be surprising that autism speaks has filled in the second half of the equation trivializing the horror of this terrible disability that presents autistics from having not only being deprived of their humanity by often not being able to work, given the high unemployment rates for autistics and others who are disabled, but also claiming that their insurance reform crusade is some sort of easy quick fix to ensure that autistics will have friends if the treatments of choice are paid for with health insurance. The following video has recently been produced by autism speaks:In this brief clip, we see a boy with autism who apparently received treatments that were covered by insurance being invited to play a game of soccer by a neurotypical child and being accepted. We see a second boy with autism, who did not have the insurance coverage enabling him to get help, being rejected by peers.My question to Autism speaks is Where's the beef? I have ofcited the problems with Lovaas(1987) and the groundless claims that have been made for it. But Lovaas (1987) only deals with IQ score tests and the ability to complete a normal first grade and subjective impressions by school teachers as the dependent variables being studied. There is no empirical evidence that this treatment enabled autistic children to better able to make friends or acquire a boyfriend or girlfriend. How can speech therapy enable a person to acquire friends. I am a formally nonverbal autistic who recovered his speech, yet the recovery of my speech has not enabled me to have successful relationships with people. I remain largely friendless and celibate. I also underwent perceptual motor training in the 1960s which might be comparable to some of the occupational therapy that these insurance reform crusades are trying to get the insurance companies to cough up the payment for. Not only were these worthless in helping my handwriting, fine motor and perceptual motor impairments, they did nothing to help me in my social life either.So, really, how can any of these therapies help a child make friends and be accepted by peers. My inability to love and work due to my autism has stripped me of my humanity that Freud wrote about over a hundred years ago. Autism speaks in their zeal to provide a quick fix has trivialized my lack of humanity as well with this demagogic campaign and video. The capital behind this organization and others, and the other lobbies are so powerful, they will likely get the insurance reform they want. Not only in the legislatures of all 50 states but with the federal government as well, closing any loopholes. The results will  wreak financial havoc on Blue Cross, Kaiser and other hapless health care providers when the plethora of families affected by autism are fueled with the false hope that this video gives, not to mention the lower quality of health care we will receive because these insurers have to pay for autism therapies.  The cost of health care insurance in the U.S.A., which unlike other countries has no national health coverage ,will undoubtedly skyrocket even more, considering how much it is increased, considering as many as 1/150 children may be receiving these treatments once they are mandated.   I think of not only all the women that have rejected me and how unfriendly they were to me, I also think how hard it was for me as a child, constantly getting into conflicts with other kids my age, being teased and picked on, being rebuffed and being kicked out of their homes because they found my behavior and autism so offensive and they were so prejudiced against me.  So, according to autism speaks' latest propaganda campaign, had these \"evidenced based\" therapies been available in my childhood, had I done these interventions instead of undergoing psychoanalysis, and my parents' medical insurance had paid for them, I would not have been rejected.  I would have just been fine.  Instead of the arguments and other kids kicking me out of their houses, I would have been invited on playdates.  I would not have been rejected and rebuffed by peers.  How comforting it must be for parents and their children to know, these \"evidenced based\" therapies will ensure that they will not only have to worry about unemployment, but will have a ton of friends and girlfriends to take to their regular high school prom.  They can make their six figure income, marry their high school sweetheart they took to the prom and live happily ever after.  Perhaps I sound bitter in this post because I am. Well maybe after all these insurance bills are passed and the millions upon millions of dollars of reimbursement that will be coughed up for all of these \"evidence based\" treatments are paid for, maybe we will see some studies or peer reviewed evidence actually showing that at least some of these autistic children were able to lead a normal social lives.  If not, perhaps autism speaks will have even more reduced credibility.  No one will probably even noticed that they gave Laurent Mottron, a medical doctor who states that autism is not harmful and is no dysfunction and is only a difference and posthumously diagnosed one historical figure he could not have possibly met since he was born after this person's death  half a million bucks to do research showing how well high functioning autistics can do on various tests and tasks.  But if these insurance paid treatments don't work, perhaps some people will take notice.  Perhaps, there will be more internal strife in this organization than we are now witnessing with the resignations of Allison Tepper Singer and Eric London.  Perhaps AS will end up losing their donations.  They might have to sell their Lear jet, cut Mark Rothmeier's (sp???) salary by a few hundred thousand dollars and perhaps cut out some other frills. Of course, I might be wrong, we might be seeing some autistic kids getting married young, winning popularity contests and being elected presidents of their student body. Let the chips fall where they may.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/07/will-insurance-reform-legislation-help.html", "title": "\nWill Insurance reform legislation help autistics' social lives?\n"},
{"date": " July 14, 2009", "body": "\nI see that the neurodiversity movement has picked up another proponent in George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen. He has recently written a rather interesting essay which gives the neurodiversity movement a rather enthusiastic shout-out. It is curious exactly what interest Dr. Cowen has in autism. One notable fact is that he was a colleague of economics nobel prize winner Vernon Smith, who has claimed to have Asperger's syndrome. They both, at one time, were on the faculty of George Mason. Other than that, the reason of Cowen's interest in autism in general and neurodiversity in particular is something that I really don't understand.Cowen starts off in his essay by comparing negative attitudes towards autistics to racist discourse that at one time was present in universities. I find this quite ironic in light of the frequently hateful rhetoric that most ND proponents seem to espouse such as the insults of my mother by Clay Adams and Phil Gluyas, the condescending cheap shots about my special education experiences from the late but not great \"Alyric\", also a rather nasty post by the well known neurodiversity blogger \"Autism bitch from hell\" who suggests that all persons on the autistic spectrum who don't happen to agree with her enlightened view of autism should be strangled to death and turned into cat food. Not to mention David Andrew's profane diatribes against any person on the spectrum he happens to disagree with. The comparisons to Nazis and eugenicists that are often made by various ND proponents, etc. He goes to talk about an essay which details the costs of autism to society stating how offensive he and some persons on the autism spectrum find this.Cowen goes on to write:A lot of people at colleges are aware of dealing with autism (and Asperger's syndrome; I will refer generally to the autism spectrum) in their \"special needs\" programs. The more complex reality is that there is a lot more autism in higher education than most of us realize. It's not just \"special needs\" students but also our valedictorians, our faculty members, and yes \u2014 sometimes \u2014 our administrators.As a former alumnae of \"special needs\" program and someone who was not my class valedictorian, never was a university faculty member or college administrator, I must wonder about the basis of such a bold statement.He gives Temple Grandin, his colleague Vernon Smith and Richard Borcherds, an award winning mathematician, as examples of these. He goes on to acknowledge that he does not believe there has been an epidemic of autism but that there has always been a high stable rate of autism, another belief perpetuated by club ND. He states that there are probably more than a million autistic adults out there. Assuming that there are more than a million autistic adults, then 3 out a million seems to be the exception rather than the rule as Cowen implies.Grandin may in fact be an exception to that rule. She has presented with autistic symptoms at age 3, unable to speak and went from feces smearing severely autistic to Ph.D. in animal science and professor at U of Colorado. Kudos to her.Vernon Smith claimed in an interview in 2005 (at the age of 78) that he had Asperger's syndrome or at least symptoms of it. He expressed inability with social situations (in spite of the fact he was able to marry and produce children) and the ability to zone in and out. Yet, claimed that his AS was a virtue because it helped him to concentrate and produce great economic works. On reading his memoir which is available in Google books, it is unclear if he was in fact ever diagnosed with AS by a clinician. If he was, there is no mention of it in his autobiography. It would seem strange that if he were in fact diagnosed he would not have mentioned it in his interview and in his book. Apparently in the 1990s at the age of 68, Smith feeling he might have ADD underwent some psychologic testing, the circumstances are rather vague. Smith then takes Baron-Cohen's autism quotient test and based on those scores surmises he might have symptoms of Asperger's. As far as I can tell there is no other basis for Smith's having an ASD.Richard Borcherds, however, presents a somewhat different story. At a somewhat younger age than Smith (38) he decided that based on problems with social situations, lack of friends and an inability to talk normally on the telephone that there was a possibility he had Asperger's syndrome. Based on consults with Simon Baron-Cohen and his colleague Sally Wheelwright and some testing, there is some speculation as to whether or not Borcherds does in fact have Asperger's. Histories were also obtained from his parents. Baron-Cohen writes about this in his book, The Essential Difference. I am also not sure whether or not either Baron-Cohen or Wheelwright are in fact clinical psychologists qualified to make a legitimate diagnosis. I think it is quite possible they are merely cognitive psychologists who do research and neither has any formal training as a clinician. I will stand corrected if anyone who may happen to read this gives evidence to the contrary. Though there is a more detailed assessment of Borcherds than there apparently was of Smith, it is still unclear whether in fact Borcherds is on the autism spectrum. Baron-Cohen writes:One might question whether Richard Borcherds really merits a diagnosis at all, given how well adapted he is. Certainly he is not currently severe enough in his symptoms to warrant a diagnosis in adulthood, as his symptoms are not interfering with his daily functioning. In the jargon of the diagnostic criteria, he is not \"suffering any impairment in his daily life\"........So, at least two of the three examples of ASD academics are rather suspect to say the least.He then goes on to rehash the Michelle Dawson/Laurent Mottron arguments of the autistics who according to studies have superior pitch, are not as easily fooled by optical illusions as NT's, better at solving certain puzzles and are better at recognizing certain patterns, etc. Of course Cowen fails to acknolwedge, as do both Dawson and Mottron, the limitations of these studies in that the research subjects in these studies are often a much higher ratio of male to female autistics than given in the general population of autistics, have relatively normal IQ scores and are quite high functioning as compared to many other autistics. Due to the fact that autistics may move around and artifacts caused by their inability to sit still in an MRI scan or while having an EEG reading may limit the research to certain subjects, these limitations should always be acknowledged; unfortunately they are not. Also, what real life applications an ability to interpret patterns, musical pitch, and an inability to be fooled by optical illusions has is beyond my comprehension and sophistication to understand. Perhaps Dr. Cowen could explain how these autistics might not be impaired in other areas and how an inability not to be fooled by an optical illusion would enable the autistic to become a college professor or administrator in a major university.To his credit though, Cowen does acknowledge that there are at least some autistics who can't hold jobs and are truly impaired by their disabilities. Dr. Cowen should know I am one of these people. I could not even cut it as a medical transcriptionist so i had to retire. I am not ever going to get a Ph.D. degree and be a college professor.Dr. Cowen: Unlike Dr. Borcherds, I suffer from multiple impairments in my daily life. I have a defective f***ed up brain. . Your essay does not benefit me and the neurodiversity stereotypes you present in your essay only do harm.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://chronicle.com/article/Autism-as-Academic-Paradigm/47033/", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2006/02/autistic-uncle-toms.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/07/neurodiverse-economist.html", "title": "\nA neurodiverse economist\n"},
{"date": " July 13, 2009", "body": "\nI see that neurodiversity ideologue and frequent Laurent Mottron/Michelle Dawson collaborator Morton Gernsbacher has a neurodiversity op-ed piece that she wrote. Not only does she have this piece but yet another piece out that deals with a similar theme. The first piece talks about how people might load a dishwasher with cutlery facing up rather than facing down. They would load it face up to clean what would become the dirtiest parts perhaps due to a germ phobia. They might load it face down due to a  phobia of being cut. She also talks about analogies of which drawers people put their underwear in etc. She then goes on to talk about the interpretations of various brain scanning studies. The gist of her argument in the first piece is that the interpretations are subjective and that the brain studies might be measuring dysfunctions versus differences or compensations versus enhancements. It is all a matter of interpretation. The apparent insinuation can then be applied to persons with autism and other neurologic conditions. The reason that they might get different results on an fMRI scan than a typical person is not because autism is a disorder or a disease but that autism might merely only be a difference. One interesting example that she gives is a functional MRI study comparing how Americans and Japanese process faces. The two groups used different areas of the brain and modes of mechanisms to process the faces. This was due to cultural differences between the two groups and not due to a brain dysfunction among either American nor Japanese face processors.In the second piece, she talks about how differences in brain imaging studies have shown how Women can have cortical thickening as opposed to men and in this case it can be considered merely a difference. However cortical thickening amongst autistics as compared to neurotypical controls is a dysfunction rather than a difference. The articles are trying to show that autism is not necessarily a disorder just because the brains appear different or function information differently.One of the problems with the analogy of the second article that I see is that the techniques for measuring the brain with structural and functional MRIs are still too limited and primitive to detect anything other than superficial differences. Gernsbacher seems to conveniently forget this fact in her analogy. Does the fact that women and men have differences in cortical thickening and the autistics and nonautistics have similar differences show that autism versus nonautism is no more of a dysfunction of being a man versus a woman.  Do the fMRI studies on face processing show a difference between autistis versus nonautistists is similar to differences between an American versus a Japanese? No, not really. Magnetic resonance imaging can measure some limited structural differences in the brain or which brain areas blood oxygen may flow to when doing certain tasks. However, they don't show how individual neurons work or which of them might be missing.  They don't show differences in synapses or synaptic functioning that might account for the disabling factors of autism versus nonautism. They don't show a possible dysfunction in the sodium-potassium pumps in the neurons of autistics versus nonautistics. It is quite possible that at the deepest levels in autistic brains there are ionic differences in the functioning of neurons due to abnormalities of how much sodium versus potassium is in a neuron. The state of the art currently does not allow such comparisons to be made between autistic and nonautistic controls. It does not even allow the assessment of such things in living organisms period.It is possible that this may be where Gernsbacher's analogy really falls flat. You could see the same differences in men vs. women as in autistics vs. nonautistics, but they could be there for different reasons.  What if it were possible to scan for differences in individual neurons? Perhaps we would see no differences between men and women. Nor differences in the sodium-potassium pumps, blood-brain barrier functioning, etc. We might very well see these differences in autistics versus nonautistic controls. So, yes, in spite of the fact that superficial MRI scanning might find similar things in two groups prototypical versus nonprotypical they could mean very different things.I also find Gernsbacher's analogies ironic in light of the fact of Isabelle Souliere's (someone whom Gernsbacher has collaborated with in the past) recent study showing the faster processing in the occipital lobes of autistics versus nonautistic controls. Souliere's was interpreting the findings that autistics were somehow superior in this endeavor and she put her own disingenuous spin with the media on her findings stating that she hoped it would not make persons underestimate educational potential in persons with autism. So, Gernsbacher and other Mottron/Dawson collaborators might not practice what they preach. On one hand it is just individual differences, on the other hand, it means that autistics in some respects are actually superior to neurotypicals. Sorry, my dear Morton Ann, but you can't have it both ways.On a sidenote I once emailed Morton Gernsbacher asking about her essay stating in the title that autistics need acceptance and not cure. Though she may have never received funding from CAN or autism speaks, she has served them in an advisory capacity and has peer reviewed journal articles and research grants with them. I wondered why she would do this if she did not approve of a cure. She wrote me back a very nice/polite letter stating about how it was the duty of scientists to peer review and do editorial work of their colleagues and that she had not chosen the title of her article but that the media outlet who published her article had chosen the title with acceptance versus cure. In this article she claimed that persons with severe autism had made great contributions to the arts and science, yet neglected to give any specific examples.  When I wrote Dr. Gernsbacher a follow-up email, querying what person with severe rather than mild autism could have possibly made great contributions to the arts and sciences she did not answer my email as she had previously the last one.  I wonder why. Well all I can say is that Gernsbacher's editorials and the double standards that she and her colleagues have of applying interpretations to their own research trying to show how smart autistic people are and how great autism is must be another example of convoluted neurodiversity logic.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2134", "http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2112"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/07/interesting-op-ed-pieces-from-morton.html", "title": "\ninteresting op-ed pieces from Morton Gernsbacher\n"},
{"date": " July 23, 2009", "body": "\nI have just read the recent study done on neurofeedback of mu rhythms in autistic children by UCSD scientist Jaime Pineda. The preceding link is a .pdf file that I uploaded to my stories webpage in case anyone is interested in reading the study in its entirety.Mu rhythms are a brain wave that is an electrical signal indicative of activity of certain areas of the brain. These areas are located in the frontal lobe and some parts of the parietal lobe. Of interest these brain rhythms are thought to be associated with mirror neuron function. Mirror neurons are a really hot topic in autism brain research right now. One area in which mirror neurons have been found in monkeys is equivalent to Broca's area in humans, which is the area of the brain responsible for expressive speech. It is quite possible that a dysfunction in the mirror neurons in this area could be responsible for the speech delays associated with autism. I have written about this previouslyMirror neurons are a group of neurons that fire, not only when movements are being made but when movements are being observed. In experiments done with monkeys, these brain cells fired both when movement was being done and when movement was being observed by an experimenter, e.g. both when the monkey grasped a peanut and when the monkey observed the experimenter grasping a peanut. In experiments done with autistic children blood would flow to areas of the brain associated with mirror neurons when they were doing movements but not when they were observing movements made. This was not the case in normal controls whose blood flowed to the brain areas both while executing movements and watching movements. Lindsay Oberman (Who at one time was a graduate student in Pineda's lab) did an experiment showing that mu rhythms were suppressed in typical children both when they made hand motions and when they observed the hand motions of others. Autistic children's mu waves were suppressed when making motions but not when watching others' motions.If it were possible to train an autistic child through feedback, e.g. a tone or a picture that presented itself in a certain way, to suppress the mu rhythms, this could affect the functioning of mirror neurons and thus improve behavior and enable the child to function better. This paper deals with this question.In this paper, there were actually two different studies done. There were autistic children that were put in both experimental groups and a placebo control group. The experimental subjects were able to learn how to suppress their mu rhythms and the placebo group received a sham training protocol. Prior to this there had been studies of neurofeedback done on autistics but in one the controls were not considered adequate as they lacked a placebo treatment and were aware of test conditions. Other studies have just shown improvement with single subjects and had no controls. This study may be the first randomized group study using experimental groups and control groups to assess the efficacy of neurofeedback in autism. The autistic experimental subjects were able to learn how to suppress their mu rhythms. This was associated with improvement on an autism treatment scale as opposed to the control group as well as greater attention. The ATEC test( autism treatment scale) measured speech language, sociability, sensory cognitive awareness. The experimental group did far better than the placebo group who did not learn how to control their mu rhythms. Imitation behavior was also tested. Slight improvements were seen in both the experimental and control groups but there was no significant difference between the two. So apparently the mu wave suppression training does not affect imitative behaviors which are sometimes a problem with those who have autism.I believe that this may actually be a promising treatment for at least some autistic people, though probably a lot more experimental work has to be done. One of the problems, as is the case with many autism studies, is that the subjects were for the most part high functioning with overall IQs above 80. In the first study, they were all male subjects. However, in the second study there were 19 subjects, 16 males and 3 females which is fairly close (albeit on the high side)to what the ratio of persons with ASD's is in the general population of autistic persons. In fact, it may actually be lower than the ratio of fairly high functioning autistics, which has been reported to be as high as 10 to 1. Another problem with this study was that there is no way of knowing whether the improvements were due to learning how to suppress the mu rhythms or whether or not some compensatory mechanism was developed. In Mirella Depratto's fMRI mirror neuron study involving autistics, she found that autistic subjects were able to equally imitate facial expressions as well as the typical controls. However, when testing for blood flow to the inferior frontal gyrus the controls would have a high flow of blood oxygen to the inferior frontal gyrus while imitating the facial expressions but the autistics did not have blood flow to these areas. This suggested not only dysfunctions in the inferior frontal gyrus area but that at least some autistics can develop compensatory brain mechanisms in order to imitate facial expressions. Of course, from what I have read, there are some autistics, who have an impaired ability to imitate. The hypothesis for this, of course is that mirror neuron function is impaired. It is not known how long these effects last and Dr. Pineda is continuing research into this line.I am also interested in TMS as a promising treatment but have not yet done enough research in it to write about it. It is very possible that these could be promising avenues of treatment in at least some persons with ASD's At some point maybe I will write a post about TMS stay tuned!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/Pineda_RASD_76.pdf"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/07/jaime-pinedas-neurofeedback-study.html", "title": "\nJaime Pineda's neurofeedback study\n"},
{"date": " July 29, 2009", "body": "\nWell, I could not wait and I went out and saw the movie Adam. It was an interesting movie though I was not overly enthused about it. However, there were some points that hit home. The man with Asperger's has a romantic relationship with an NT woman in the movie. This is something that society sometimes has prejudicial attitudes against. For example, David Miedzianik whom I have previously written about expresses his desire to have a girlfriend in his autobiography. Uta Frith in her book, Autism, Explaining the enigma, quotes what David says but adds the adjective 'normal' in front of girlfriend, a word that David never uses. It has to be remembered this is a movie and not real life. There are problems in this relationship and the two sometimes have conflicts. The Asperger's character also mentions certain celebrities having diagnoses of autism, which as many of my readers know, I have attempted to debunk. The girl's father also does not approve of the relationship due to the Asperger's character's sometimes poor social judgment. I wrote about a similar concept in a short story I wrote some years ago, Guess who Isn't coming to lunch. I can't help but think that maybe the screenwriter read my short story, but probably not. The short story was in part inspired by my friend Jerry Newport who in turn was one of the two people inspired by the other Asperger's love story, Mozart and the Whale. However, the two characters in Mozart and the Whale both had Asperger's and \"Adam\" deals with a mixed marriage type of relationship (though the two characters are not married). Also, the movie gives a shameless plug for Lianne Wiley's book \"Pretending to be Normal\" Though I have not read this book, it is yet another autism spectrum book that I don't feel has much to offer me. The author is a female (10 to 1 ratio of males to females among both AS and HFA), has a husband and children as well as a doctorate degree. This is someone who does not seem terribly impaired to me from what I know about her, so with memoirs like these, you really don't know how much a celibate, not successful, hardly ever gainfully employed autistic male fares or can get insights about them.The character in the movie also had a pretty good job compared to most on the spectrum-electronics engineer. However, he is let go from this job and then his girlfriend gives him a book on getting employment for asperger's, which I think was another actual book that Jessica Kingsley published and not some fictional book for the movie. The being fired certainly hits home with me and I suspect some other persons on the spectrum as well. The character had disclosed his disability to the employer, so, at least in the movie, disclosure did not work. I don't believe it works too well in real life either.I wonder if there will be other autism and asperger's movies. There probably will be someday but it seems that in proportion to the popularity of autism (as well as Asperger's) that has become pervasive there is a surprising dearth of them.I am not sure I should say anything else about the movie as it would ruin it for anyone who might want to see it. I still wish that autism with a speech delay (which is what I had as a toddler) and Asperger's were treated as separate disorders in the DSM and in other places. Then Ari Ne'eman and the rest of the NDs who may have AS but never had a speech delay won't try to speak for me.Well, not a complete waste of money and good part of an afternoon, but I guess you can go see the movie and judge for yourself.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/stories/lunch.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/07/saw-movie-adam.html", "title": "\nSaw the movie Adam\n"},
{"date": " August 4, 2009", "body": "\nI have read an interesting story about some persons with an autistic child who were given a hard time by their neighbors. They filed complaints claiming that the child may have been a menace of some sort and he might come out with his father's firearm. The father, a commercial airline pilot, is required to have a firearm as part of his work due to 9/11 and part of the homeland security act. They tried to get a court injunction to get these neighbors to stay on their driveway. They called 911 on the people when the man stepped out to talk to another father about his autistic son being picked on by another boy in the neighborhood. They have reported these parents to child protective services. They called the airline where the father worked and complained about him. All of these complaints were unsubstantiated and dropped.The solution to this problem was to post a sign on the street warning people that there was an autistic child in the neighborhood. I am not sure what this is supposed to accomplish. Apparently, there was a lot of notoriety revolving around the case and all the people in the neighborhood know that he is autistic. It seems that having the sign in the neighborhood would be bad for the child and the family as there would be a certain stigma attached to it. How having a sign there would benefit the child, the neighbors or anyone else who may happen to drive or walk on that street in an apparently isolated residential area is beyond me.One devil's advocate argument that could be made is that autistic children often have problems with elopement. Some of them have drowned or been run over by cars, etc. But sometimes typical children play in the street also. I know of one typical child in my neighborhood who was hit by a car at age 4. I also remember from my youth signs, saying \"children at play\" on one or two streets. Certainly a sign like this could be put up rather than the sign singling out the autistic child and the same result would occur.However, there may be something I am missing. Perhaps there is some other reason to warn people about an autistic person. If that is the case why stop at having a sign in the child's neighborhood. Why not require the child (or possibly even adult) to wear a sign around their neck saying, \"Caution, I am autistic (or Asperger's), I may do something bad\". They are not going to just be confined to their neighborhood. They will end up going out into the world. Regardless of whether they just stay on the street where they live or go out to places, autism will cause them and the people around them some sort of problems. Prejudicial attitudes won't be just confined to one's own neighborhood. So what of the idea that autistics should be required to wear a sign around their neck at all times. After all at one time people with leprosy had to wear a warning sign and shout \"unclean\" when approaching persons not afflicted with the disease. Diabetics and epileptics wear medic-alert bracelets to warn people. Of course Leprosy, epilepsy and diabetes are quite different from autism since Leprosy is an infectious disease which was contagious (and at one time incurable) and diabetics can go into an insulin-induced coma and persons with epilepsy can have seizures and be rendered unconscious.Disclosure is given as a quick fix solution to some of the problems of autistics, claiming that for the autistic who wants to make a living and not be fired or have problems with the employer that they should be upfront with their employer (or prospective employer) about the disability and then there won't be problems on the job. As this has not been the case with me, Stephanie Keil or Michelle Dawson (all three of us have lost jobs in spite of disclosure) and others that I know, I really don't think disclosure works. If we teach acceptance, the NT world will learn to tolerate differences and autism won't be a problem, at least according to neurodiversity. In fact, I remember something autism diva wrote someplace (though I don't have the link handy) that neurodiversity was about getting people like Rick Rollens to stop calling autistics \"train wrecks\" or \"toxic waste dumps\" and Jon Shestack to stop saying they are \"empty shells\", then employers will be more inclined to hire persons with autism.I sort of worry about what might happen in light of this neighborhood sign. I can't think of how humiliating and degrading it would be if autistic children (and adults) were required to wear some sort of sign around their necks. Simple solutions to hard problems like autism are always tempting; however, I hope that neither I nor anyone else will ever be forced to wear a sign around our neck.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-3565-Autism--Parenting-Examiner~y2009m8d2-Neighbors-cruel-discrimination-against-autistic-child"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/08/should-autistics-wear-sign-around-their.html", "title": "\nShould autistics wear a sign around their necks?\n"},
{"date": " July 25, 2009", "body": "\nAt least some readers of this blog will remember some time ago that I wrote a post about a young lady who calls herself sadder but wiser girl this gal who did not like my writings that were unfavorable to the ND movement and she accused me of among other things being like a jew who was helping nazis kill other jews. After I wrote the blog post that I linked to a reader of autism's gadfly e-mailed me privately and told me this girl was only 15 years old. I had not bothered to look at her profile on the website at the time I wrote the post. This was in spite of its availability. So, at the time, I did not know how young she was.Persons familiar with the sad saga and hardball tactics of club ND know the story of Kelly Beckham a 14-year-old girl who made a website called NT speaks in which she borrowed from the graphics of Autism Speaks webpage. AS threatened her with a lawsuit and because she did not want her parents to find out what she had done she deleted the website. AS dropped the threats of the lawsuit when they found out how young the girl was. This kid became a cause celebre' of the neurodiversity movement who used this as an excuse to call AS an oppressive bully.Ari Ne'eman is now at the age 21, probably the most visible and prominent spokesperson for neurodiversity. We see that Ne'eman was preaching the neurodiversity party line going back to when he was in high school.Last, but certainly far from least we see a rather interesting video of a cute 7-year-old autistic boy named Darby who discusses how much he detests a cure for autism.We see the young lad, interviewed by someone (presumably his father), giving him what seems like some deliberate teleprompted queues that are designed as rather demagogic propaganda to help promote the neurodiversity movement.I wonder if anyone sees a pattern here. I am reminded of an old song that was popular in my youth in the early 1970s by the group Crosby, Stills and Nash \"Teach Your Children Well\" For those who don't remember this song, here is the video:Perhaps this could be neurodiversity's theme song. This is one of the hardball techniques that are used by the cyberbullies and hatemongers in the ND movement to generate their hateful propaganda and lies. Those who read my piece on my stories website urging persons to reject neurodiversity remember that I stated that neurodiversites behave like Christian missionaries trying to convert people to club ND who will use it as a tempting escape valve. Neurodiversity seems to have an idea who the best pickings are. Very small children, the younger the better. Have the adolescent girls, sadder but wiser girl and Kelly Beckham really have enough life experience to know better? They have never been out in the world or tried to hold down a job with their disability. They don't have the same experience to know these things that I have in my 50s. They are young and impressionable. Even the now adult (albeit young adult) Ari Ne'eman has never worked a job a day in his life. Yet he seems to feel that he is qualified to use his influence to lobby the government with public policy suggestions to help autistics work or get voc rehab without curing them. What would a 7 year old child know about any of these things. Where could he possibly have gotten ideas like these? What life experience has he had? He has not yet reached adolescence where celibacy, often the bane of autistic males, would play a role. There can be no question at all that ND went for these people because they are most vulnerable. Perhaps having a cute 7 year old child on a video talking about how bad a cure for autism would be would seem somehow charming. In the warped minds of persons who believe in neurodiversity, this could be used as a propaganda tool to help convert those and get more internet war mongers on their side.It is not just children that are seen as vulnerable, but also adults that seem to have a lesser intelligence also. I have a friend with an ASD who has difficulties with expressive and receptive language. Some ND's befriended him hoping to convert him to their belief. They did for a while and he went around saying that he did not want to be cured. Then, finally, when he saw how bad his disability was, he was thankfully intelligent enough to see what a scam ND is. He decided he wanted a cure. These people no longer wanted to be his friends when they found they had no further use for him. This person is intelligent. To someone who does not know him well, the way he talks and has difficulty understanding things that are spoken to him would make him seem less intelligent than he really is. This is likely why ND tried to proselytize him.These are the methods that ND bullies use. These people are very poor role models for children. They behave badly, they are rude, and in the case of one individual I can think of, they use gross profanity. As I have mentioned in some previous posts, \"the autism bitch from hell\" wants those of us with autism who wish to be cured strangled to death and turned into cat food. I wonder if the parents of these children feel these are people who are a good influence. I believe not.I suppose, some of the members of the neurodiversity movement are old enough to remember the old Crosby Stills and Nash song. Therefore they believe they can win their puny little internet wars by teaching their children well.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/71/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/07/neurodiversity-teach-your-children-well.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity: Teach Your Children Well\n"},
{"date": " June 26, 2009", "body": "\nI have just seen that New Jersey is the 14th state in the union to pass mandatory insurance coverage for therapies for autistic persons up to the age of 21. This is an interesting video on that subject:Very sad. One person paying three quarters of a million for therapy. One person remortgaging their house three times. One of the assembly speakers Joan Voss, whose son has Asperger's, makes the guarantee that with this bill parents will be able to purchase therapies that will allow all autistic children to be functioning adults as she alleges her son has. Bob Wright, who started autism speaks, also has a few things to say on the matter. At the end of the video the statement is made that these therapies will allow autistics to become functioning adults. Where is the proof? What person with autism became a \"functioning adult\" whatever that nebulous term means through any therapy? To quote the old 1980's television commercial, where's the beef? Adult autistics are ignored and are invisible. I have written about this in my essay The invisible autistic adult. At the time I wrote it some years ago, I was not aware that the children in Lovaas (1987) were adults-currently in their late 30s, early 40s. But I did ask about the adult outcomes. As I have written before, Lovaas and company have been paid at taxpayer expense to research and publish on these adult outcomes. To this day they still haven't. So one wonders if this insurance reform will really produce \"functioning adults\" Course that term could have a variety of semantic interpretations. Noah Greenfeld, one of Lovaas' first research subjects, may be a functioning adult, but his functioning is quite low and he will remain in institutional care the rest of his life. I think of the money my parents paid for my treatments. particularly the sensorimotor training I had which did nothing to improve my fine motor coordination, handwriting problems and perceptual motor impairments in spite of the usual claims of amelioration that were made to my folks.I also wonder about the harm of these insurance reform bills. I currently have medical coverage on my parent's plan as a disabled dependent. I will lose that coverage when my parents who are in their 80s are deceased. Even if I inherit enough money or by some miracle I will be able to make a good living someday and purchase my own medical insurance, will I be allowed coverage after this law has been passed? After all this means that autism will be a pre-existing condition. Will parents with autistic child who don't have insurance be able to purchase it with their child's pre-existing condition. What if an autistic child needs a liver transplant or some other very expensive treatment? Also, this is not to mention how much health insurance rates and health costs, already prohibitively expensive for some with insurance rates rising will continue to rise. Does this mean others will have to pay more for their non-autism related treatments. I can only wonder.In any event, I found this video interesting. Perhaps you will too.

{"date": " July 30, 2009", "body": "\nWell, I guess it's that time of year again. In accordance with the combating autism act, the IACC is asking for input from U.S. citizens. It's time for Gadfly to do his civic duty as an American citizen and adult with autism and offer his thoughts.The form was very bureaucratic and difficult as is typical for the government in general and the IACC in particular. So I will just go into the gist of what my suggestions were. I realize that this was probably about as effective as writing a letter to Santa Claus but I did it anyhow. Also, the IACC and the combating autism act have been a pretty big joke since their inception and I am not terribly optimistic about this act being able to produce research or other things that will help persons with autism.I stated that I was concerned about how the IACC allows certain members of the neurodiversity movement, namely Ari Ne'eman and Katie Miller to testify before its committee. They are naturally testifying against a cure for autism and research that could result in prevention of someone becoming autistic. This defeats the entire purpose of the combating autism act. I suggested that they and others like them not be allowed to testify or give their thoughts. Members of the neurodiversity movement protested this law and then hypocritically embraced it after it passed and found they had a soapbox on which to present their platform to the government. I wrote about this previouslyI also wrote that I believed that at least one person on the spectrum who is in favor of a cure and prevention of autism be appointed as a public member of the IACC. The combating autism act stated that at least one public member would have to be on the spectrum. Currently that person is Stephen Shore, an autistic who opposes curing and preventing autism. I said that I did not believe that Stephen should be a public member of the IACC because he disagrees with the principles of the combating autism act.I wrote about my concern that both Shore and John Robison are allowed to review grants for research that is publically funded. Both of these individuals have expressed opposition to a cure for at least some ASD's. Also, I don't believe either of them has the necessary qualifications to review this research. I believe that people should be chosen on their merit rather than on their ability to get a lot of autism conference speaking engagements or their ability to write a commercially successful memoir.I wrote about discontinuing research on vaccines as I believe there is no proof that vaccines cause autism and so far there is evidence that they don't. Also if you read the 2003 california report the tripling of prevalence between 1970 and 1990 does not correspond with an increase in the vaccination schedule. So there is not even a correlation let alone proof of causation. I have written more about this elsewhereI also urged them that if Morton Ann Gernsbacher is receiving federal funding for her research that this funding be discontinued immediately. This is someone who has written that autism is not harmfulI also voiced concern about the lack of published adult outcomes in Lovaas' 1987 research.  This is in spite of the NIMH funding that Lovaas received to publish these adult outcomes. I suggested that funding for ABA be discontinued until these outcomes have been published in a peer reviewed journal.I also wrote about what could be done in addition to not what should be done.  I suggested using Rhesus monkeys as an animal model of autism in light of the research done by Harry Harlow in which he isolated the rhesus monkeys and they showed traits similar to autism, such as rocking and self-mutilatory behaviors.  I suggested that elderly persons with autism be found and be persuaded to will their brains to science.  Also, suggested that research on norepinephrine as a causative basis of autism be funded, as the dorsal tegmental bundle which is the main norepinephrine tract in the brain travels through parts of the brain that have been implicated in autism such as the cerebellum and hippocampus. I also suggested job training program for adolescents and young adults on the spectrum. Of course, I won't hold my breath for too long waiting for the IACC to enact any of my suggestions.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/thimerosal.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/07/gadfly-gives-his-input-to-iacc.html", "title": "\nGadfly gives his input to IACC\n"},
{"date": " August 10, 2009", "body": "\nI have just come across a new interesting online petition from some people who apparently don't like autism speaks. The petition is entitled. Autism Speaks is a Joke.You might realize the code to eventually be able to abort autistic births for the sake of health care costs but i say it's still barbaric. We are not puzzlepeices nor a reason to be cured. Cureing should be reserved for bad things. There is nothing bad about Autism it makes us special, smarter, proof of great things... etc. How dare anyone would assume different. How normal do you have to be to live in this world? Such a company will unleash murder of anyone who isn't functioning like a person should and that died out with Hitler years ago. Do we want to be the next abu dhabi injustice?!Be careful how you put things across or it could backfire!!On another part of the site the petition is explained.We the undersigned beg you to reconsider your idea of how to deal with or talk about Autism/economy. Please make abortion illigal just in case and keep an eye on how word spreads.Interestingly enough these people say that cures should only be for bad things. They claim that not being able to make a living, meeting your significant other, not being able to speak, not being able to get a decent education in a regular school setting, behaving in disruptive fashion, having self-injurious behaviors that can permanently cripple a person, being at risk for being run over by a car or killed, having phobias, having uncontrollable self-stimulations, not being able to engage in goal directed activities, having motor impairments that prevent you from being able to handwrite properly, not having friends and in some cases being violent, in some cases committing crimes is not a bad thing.They also state the old cliche about autism making someone superior instead of handicapped.It would seem that in this person's case autism did not make them smarter.  Check out the rhetoric, particularly the spelling of 'illegal'. If this is an example of of someone who was made smarter or superior by autism, I would hate to see someone for whom autism was not a gift from God. I would think in addition to wanting a cure for autism whoever wrote this petition would want a cure for illiteracy as well since they do not seem terribly literate from what they wrote on the petition.It is old propaganda, the abortion shtick and the equating those of us who wish a cure to being nazis. And the old reaction-formation induced assertion that autism is great, a gift that makes people superior instead of handicapped. So far, they have 5 signatures, they want 1,000, so only 995 to go until they reach their goal.Though I do not agree with the body of the petition, I do agree with the title. Autism speaks is a joke. They have given a grant of half a million dollars recently to the infamous Laurent Mottron, a medical doctor who doubles as a researcher and states that autism is not harmful, it is not a dysfunction but merely a difference and states that curing autism is nonsensical and instead of trying to find ways to help persons with autism uses the huge amount of research funding he receives to prove how smart and how great autistic people are. Though his research subjects are most likely made up of mostly very high functioning persons with autism. Given that this man and his sidekicks, Morton Gernsbacher and Michelle Dawson, are the darlings of the ND movement, I would think they would be delighted with AS rather than rebuking them. I think AS has $20 million in assets designated for scientific funding. So, 2.5% of their funding goes to a neurodiversity concern. Autism speaks also funds research into thimerosal in spite of all the evidence against it causing autism, has Sally Bernard on their board of directors, spends tons of money on advertising claiming that if insurance reform is implemented this will enable autistic children to have playdates and friends, has a campaign encouraging people to hire autistics as employees in the workplace, yet not employing a single person with autism in their organization, not even as a minimum wage file clerk, and apparently has collaborated with William Stillman in their school package, a self-diagnosed Asperger's person, who claims that autism was created by divine providence and without any formal qualifications and credentials, charges $100 an hour for a phone consultation for an autistic child. Stillman also states that in 5-10 years the autism prevalence will be 1/10. Their president, Mark Rothmeier, not long ago stated that autism affected 1.5 million children. After Michelle Dawson pointed out this error using data culled from the epidemiological literature on autism as well as recent U.S. population statistics, the word children was edited out of the article. To borrow from Richard Nixon, AS gave Dawson the sword and she stuck it in and twisted it with relish.Indeed a great title for a petition! So sad that the body of the petition was such cliched nonsense written by someone not terribly literate who would have the actual audacity to claim that autism makes people superior and/or gifted.  Of course this might have been someone quite young who wrote this, as we see from one post I recently wrote that for certain reasons, neurodiversity attempts to proselytize those who are as young and naive as possible.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/autism-speaks-is-a-joke"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/08/new-interesting-petition-from.html", "title": "\na new interesting petition from neurodiversity\n"},
{"date": " August 12, 2009", "body": "\nIn what would seem to be a rather weary if not cliched genre, I see that yet another person with Asperger's, not diagnosed until very late in life has joined the August company of John Elder Robison, Liane Wiley, Michael John Carley in penning a memoir describing what it is like to have Asperger's. As is the case with his three predecessors, Tim Page is also someone atypical of someone with an autism spectrum disorder in that he has been a hugely successful music critic and a pulitzer prize winning writer. Though I concede one can't judge a book by its cover (another cliche I admit) I don't think I will be reading this book, as I don't think he is someone I can resonate with, whom if he can be a pulitzer prize winning writer, most likely does not have problems of the magnitude of mine. I can still remember in the pre-Asperger's days when Temple Grandin and David Miedzianik were the only two persons in the world with ASD's who had written autobiographical books.  Robison has spoken for all persons with Asperger's saying a cure is not needed under any circumstance. Michael Carley has gone a bit further than Robison stating the old neurodiversity piece of propaganda that most persons on the autism spectrum don't wish a cure. Most troublesome of all, at least at one time, Wiley stated that autism should be celebrated on her web page, though I think she may have changed that. Tragically, her book was given a shameless plug in the movie Adam. I still wonder if there will ever be a person on the spectrum who will write a memoir about how adverse their life is. How they went to special ed schools, and were unable to work or find a romantic relationship. I know this sounds familiar, but personally I probably would not have an interest in writing a complete memoir. I did write a short (nonpublished) nonfiction book about some of my takes in autism which consisted of 10 chapters. One of the chapters is my essay in which I attempt to refute the diagnosis of various persons claimed to be autistic, so I suppose I could claim my book is one-tenth self-published. The rest of the book would need major overhaul to be of publishable quality and I sort of crashed and burned on the project. Even if I had a book ready for submission anyplace, I don't think I would have much of a chance of having it published.A few years ago Page wrote an essay of his own about his Asperger's and childhood which was published in the New Yorker.  In this essay he describes a rather tumultuous childhood with discipline problems in school, poor grades and having some children bully him.  This was apparently a regular mainstream school.  Page then describes his ascension to adulthood becoming a successful writer and editor of various periodicals.  He is vague in the essay as to how he so easily made the transition from troubled child to successful adult.  He is told by someone in the year 2000 (well in his 40s) that he has Asperger's syndrome.  He is vague as to whether he was actually diagnosed by a clinician. To Page's credit, he admits that others with AS are not as fortunate as he is and some of them end up institutionalized or were transients near where he lived in New York.Though he does not state an opinion about the neurodiversity movement, he does mention its existence as well as discuss Aspies for Freedom as one example of some people who regard AS as a difference not needing a cure. I do not know if Mr. Page is married as are his three predecessor memoirists in this fast growing genre. Well, I think I will pass on Page's book, but I suppose not everyone will feel the way I do.  I don't know how successful Carley's and Wiley's books were, but I know Robison's was a best seller.  I suppose there must be people who want to read about successful persons with Asperger's since the genre seems to keep growing exponentially.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Play-Growing-Undiagnosed-Aspergers/dp/0385525621/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1250087496&sr=1-1", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/undiagnosing.html", "http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/08/20/070820fa_fact_page"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/08/yet-another-adult-aspergers-memoir.html", "title": "\nYet another adult Asperger's memoir\n"},

Previously about two years ago (or maybe a year and a half ago) Ne'eman and others lead a protest to have the famous ransom notes campaign ended.  They were successful in this end.  Interestingly, well-known ND blogger autism bitch from hell joined in the fray.  This is a woman who apparently finds humor in saying that autistic persons such as myself who desire a cure should be strangled to death and turned into cat food, yet somehow finds a sign saying that autism is as bad as being kidnapped offensive, go figure.   The issue was quickly resolved, as Amy Wallace, the president of the chapter, wrote an apology letter to club 166 and the sign was removed.  ND rejoiced in this great victory. This sign was not even exactly like the ransom notes campaign which stated that autistic children were being held hostage.  The sign just said if children were kidnapped it would be an emergency but did not say the autistic children were being kidnapped.A victory for ND?  Yes, I agree, it was.  However, more importantly was this a victory for autistic persons and their families?  I do not believe it was.  If I remember correctly club 166's son is 9 years old-still not old enough to have faced all of the challenges that autism will impose when the person on the spectrum reaches adolescence and adulthood.  What does club 166 really know about the adolescence angst of rejection? What does he know of being fired from multiple jobs and not being able to make a living.  These scenarios for his son \"buddy boy\" when he is older are certainly not implausible.  How will having get rid of this billboard help \"buddy boy\" to have a decent life, with friends, a decent education, a job.  How will it make a difference in his life.  Will he be able to function in society properly?  Will he be able to have hobbies and do the things he wants? I will admit, I don't know anything about buddy boy's clinical picture, so I will talk about something more generic.  What of even relatively high functioning (mildly) autistic children, who can't even get through kindergarten and get in trouble for breaking crayons and not being able to pay attention to the teacher, only to have to repeat kindergarten?  I know of one case of this, as the mother of a boy who had this recently happen to her son had written me and my mother about this.  I met this boy.  He is 6, has mild problems compared to many autistic children.  I wonder though about his self-esteem at having to repeat kindergarten.  How will this help high functioning people who have trouble managing their affairs, paying their bills, having independent living skills.  How will it help them behaviorally if they can't keep quiet in a movie theatre and disturb other patrons?  I know of one autistic child who did this.  How will it help one person who was kicked out of our autism group because he could not control untoward sexual advances towards persons who came to the meeting?These are all relatively mild cases of autism that I have talked about above.  What of the severely autistic persons, those who can't speak, and pound their heads into cement.  How will removing this billboard help them? If neurodiversity is really about human rights and dignity, if it is about helping autistics achieve their full potential and this is the best they can do I believe it is rather pathetic. Is this a victory for autistic people.  I believe not.  We have had a quick resolution to the problem of the sign, but now what?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/08/quick-resolution.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/08/quick-resolution-but-now-what.html", "title": "\nA quick resolution, but now what?\n"},
{"date": " August 16, 2009", "body": "\nOne of the arguments that the neurodiversity movement makes against curing autism or against spending money on research with the intent of curing autism rather than curing AIDS or cancer is that AIDS and cancer and other normally fatal diseases kill people. They state that autism is okay because autism does not kill people it would seem once again neurodiversity gets it wrong.Many members of the neurodiversity movement expressed outrage when Katie McCarron was sensely murdered by her mother and I agree with them rightfully so. However, they basically blamed autism speaks and indirectly blamed people (myself included) who wanted a cure for autism for Katie's horrible murder. I wonder if any tears will be shed by ND for Ryan Barrett who will not live to see his 15th birthday because of autism. Somehow I don't think so. I will admit one exception to this general rule was Ari Ne'eman expressing condolences at Ashley Brock's drowning in a comment on Ginger Taylor's Adventures in autism blog. Other than that, I don't know of a single example where a member of the ND community was not outraged by the senseless death of an autistic child who was killed by their autism per se, rather than being murdered by a disturbed parent or caretaker.Though a tragedy like this makes me guffaw even more at the ND movement, I will resist the temptation to blame neurodiversity for Ryan Barrett's untimely demise. I don't want to lower myself to their level.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wten.com/Global/story.asp?S=10930462"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/08/neurodiversity-refuted-once-more.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity refuted once more\n"},
{"date": " September 21, 2009", "body": "\nAutism speaks, the behemoth autism organization which appears to be a figurative jack of all trades and a master of none has yet engaged in some more dilettantism and has now added to their Felix the Cat bag of tricks and items something new. They now seem to be accepting non-fiction pieces for possible publication on their website. I just finished reading one rather moving piece about a young boy with autism who has an interesting obsession with garage doors. My interest was piqued by the fact that at the bottom of the piece it stated that autism speaks was accepting personal stories about autism. I have debated whether I should write a piece and submit it to them. They were vague about the submission format but I presume someone could submit a word rich text file as an attachment and they would have no problem opening it.However, this is an organization that on occasion has offended my sensibilities due to their funding Laurent Mottron and possibly other neurodiversity concerns, theirautism in the workplace dog and pony show which does not include employing any autistics in their organization and other reasons. So should I become an apostate and submit an article to them. After all, the pickings seem to be slim in terms of where a non-fiction writer such as myself who wishes to break out of the blogosphere can submit an article. I did have my piece on autism genetics and suffering published on Exceptional Parents' magazine website. The autism spectrum quarterly rejected my submissions claiming they were more into self-help type things and my theoretical and academic questions about ASD's were not within the genre they would accept. Trying to compete with Tim Page and submitting a piece to the New Yorker would seem out of the question for this fledgling, nobody writer. I did submit my essay exploring the irony about the fact that the headquarters for the Lovaas Institute for Early Intervention is located in the same building on the same floor as the social security office in West Los Angeles to the Newsweek my turn column. I never heard back from them so I can presume my essay was one of the 199 out of 200 submissions that they get which did not make the cut. So I have to wonder if it would be ethical to submit a piece to AS due to my misgivings about them.Laurent Mottron seems to have forsaken his principles in soliciting money and accepting approximately half a million dollars from an organization whose main goal he says is \"nonsensical\". His sidekick, Michelle Dawson, who on more than one occasion has expressed her contempt for autism speaks and the persons who donate money to them, also seems to have forsaken her principles in that she has not resigned from the Mottron group in protest. When asked about this her only dumbfounding reply was \"science isn't politics\". If these two august individuals can swallow their pride maybe I should also, but I am not sure I want to be attempted by submitting an article to AS.One other issue that is germane is whether or not personal experiences with autism just include those of parents of autistics or persons with ASD's themselves. AS was not specific in addressing this issue. The first essay they have published was written by a parent of an autistic and not an autistic themselves. As many people have correctly pointed out autism speaks may not be interested in hearing what high functioning autistics themselves have to say. One of neurodiversity's banes of contention has been their neglect to appoint a person on the spectrum to the board of directors the way other autism organizations have. So I am not sure they would publish an essay written by an autistic themselves in addition to a parent's essay or a special educator's or other professionalsTo any neurodiversity proponents who happen to read this: Here is your chance to get your views about autism out. You are always trying to convince curebies of your way of thinking. Michelle Dawson and Laurent Mottron and Isabelle Souleries have no qualms of accepting this tainted money. Perhaps you people should have no qualms either.I have not made the decision 100% myself in this dilemma but probably the best course for me is to resist temptation. I may just have to be content to be a self-published writer on this humble blog.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/community/ownwords/intheirownwords_rlevine.php", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/lovaas.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/09/autism-speaks-accepting-nonfiction.html", "title": "\nautism speaks accepting nonfiction submissions\n"},
{"date": " August 24, 2009", "body": "\nI have been reading the latest blog entry of \"Orac\", a cancer surgeon who occasionally writes about autism and the anti-vaccination movement and seems to have a neurodiversity following. I could not resist making a comment there when I felt that he was trivializing the hardships that persons with mild autism like myself have endured in their life. I won't post my comment here but I guess anyone interested can read it on the respectful insolence blog.Orac writes: it is disturbing that she views autism as so frightening. The main reason it's frightening is because that's the message in the media and the anti-vaccine movement: that autism is terrifying, that it \"steals the child's soul\" (that's what Jenny McCarthy's co-author has said); that it is beyond hope. While there's no doubt that raising a child with severe autism is an incredible challenge, the image of autism many parents have is that it is all like the most severe cases, when it is not. As the term \"autism spectrum disorders\" implies, it's a spectrum, from the very mild to the very severe.So, it would appear that Orac would believe that a mild case of autism such as I have is nothing to be frightened of. He does not understand what it is like not to have romantic relationships, not to be able to make a living, having had to attend special education schools, having been fired from multiple jobs, having phobias, having an uncontrollable addiction to self-stimulatory behaviors and having a perceptual motor impairment that prevents people from being able to handwrite very well or do other activities. He seems to believe that the prognosis for those with autism, particularly the mild cases, is not hopeless, but I must disagree. Aside from the severe cases, people are afraid of autism because it is a problem, it makes lives of those and their loved ones quite difficult. I agree that it is a noble goal that he disputes the anti-vaccine crowd and speaks out against the biomed quackery and I commend him for it. As far as I can tell, Orac has no personal experience with autism whatsoever. He seems to have some unrealistic ideas about autism that come from having listened to the mistruths of so many members of the ND movement who read and comment on his blog. But there is another side to this story and I believe that Orac should listen to persons on the spectrum who are not neurodiverse. I hope that he will read my comments and at least think about them.Of course, various neurodiversity spinmeisters who read his blog tried to refute what I said. One person named Pablo did not understand how I would complain about ND on one hand and also complain about being in special ed on the other. He has the false belief that ND is in favor of equal rights for persons with autism and want them to be educated with mainstream students. Pablo obviously does not know about Ari Ne'eman's and ASAN's activities in lobbying for full federal funding of the horrible IDEA law. This law helps parents pay for special education schools. So exactly the opposite is true. ND tries to lobby for special ed, at least some of them.Another response from someone called Clare:Ummm... since many of the self-same advocates are themselves mildly autistic, I think they are very well aware of the hardships... That said, I think you misinterpret Orac's point, which is that blanket characterizations of autism as a \"frightening\" condition are likely to dissuade parents from seeking realistic and effective medical advice (and interventions as and where appropriate), and instead drive them towards \"therapies\" that are ineffective and frankly dangerous My dear Clare: I am very skeptical of the autism of many of those in the ND movement. Most of them allegedly have Asperger's and did not have the speech delay I had as a toddler. Even the one's claiming Asperger's I question whether they really are on the spectrum and I know many of them never went to special ed schools, were able to get married and in some cases make a good living. I don't believe most of them have had experiences like mine. If research could go ahead unimpeded then perhaps we could find real effective treatments or even a cure. But the ND's that Clare defends don't want this. They want to stop science research that will find the genetic and neurologic etiologies of autism that will lead to real treatments. Unless it is Laurent Mottron's research just done on high functioning autistics that just tries to prove how smart or how great autistics are. Until real answers are found many parents will become desperate and try quick fixes that might be dangerous and are of dubious value. The ND movement just helps propagate this by preventing legitimate treatments and cures from being found.One person calling themselves Calli Arcale challenged me to tell Temple Grandin what I said, even though my problems are more severe than Grandin's. She (or he) also goes on to state that if certain people engage in fear mongering against autism, then people will spend money on chelation and other ineffective biomed treatments. They state that autism is manageable so, they can just do these manageable treatments rather than the biomed/DAN type treatments. I do not agree that autism is manageable. I do not believe there are any effective treatments and the prognosis for most persons with autism, even mild autism, is poor.She goes on to state:People get the idea that autistic people are monsters, and then they don't want to spend money to help them. They want to lock them away where they will not hurt the general public. That's what was done with autistic people a century ago. People were so afraid that they decided that these people were not really people, and that it would be okay to take away their rights to life, liberty, property, and self-determination.jonathan, I think making \"neurodiversity\" a movement a la feminism has some of the same dangers that feminism itself has -- that is, it runs the risk of becoming a parody of its goal. That doesn't mean it's always wrong, nor does it mean that the basic idea isn't sound. Feminists are definitely known to go overboard; but women do deserve equal rights to men. Neurodiversity could eventually go too far as well; but that doesn't mean autistic people (and depressed people, and addicted people, and so on) aren't every bit as worthy as \"normal\" people.You say that neurodiversity has had the opposite effect, that it has increased stigma -- could you elaborate, please? I'm not aware of any instances of this happening, especially since very people in the general public are even aware of the movement. (They're more aware of Age of Autism and such.)Needless to say there are persons with autism who hit babies and commit crimes and even kill people as a direct result of their autism. That is not to say the majority of persons with autism are like that. But autism being a dangerous condition in at least some cases is certainly a reality. If anyone makes autistics look like absolute monsters it is those in the neurodiversity movement. From being sweared at by David Andrews, from having Clay Adams and Phil Gluyas insult my mother and write insulting name calling comments which I never post on here, and going to other blogs and ridiculing me and from the abusive and condescending remarks I had to endure from Alyric before she passed away. Not to mention the fact they teach teenage kids like sadder but wiser girl that people like me are like Jews who help Nazis murder other Jews and Ari Ne'eman claiming autism speaks is morally complicit with murder and the autism bitch from hell saying that persons like myself should be strangled to death and turned into cat food. This is the stigma that is created towards autistic people. This is one reason why I blog critical posts of neurodiversity. I feel they make us all look like monsters when most of us are not like that at all. With increased media coverage, particularly of Ari Ne'eman, there has been much greater awareness of neurodiversity and this will probably continue.Comparing the woman's lib movement to ND is absurd. ND is not about equal rights. It is about denying persons the right to treatment and cures that might exist. It is about spreading propaganda like the autism no myths video staring Ari Ne'eman who claims that the prognosis for persons with autism is just fine when nothing is further from the truth.So Orac and his ND followers get it wrong.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/bad_bad_bad_autism_advice_in_the_washing.php"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/08/orac-and-his-neurodiversity-followers.html", "title": "\nOrac and his neurodiversity followers get it wrong\n"},
{"date": " September 8, 2009", "body": "\nToday, I finally had my SSDI hearing. I was told by my lawyer it will take about 3 months before I receive the ruling from the judge. As I have mentioned in previous posts, I have waited nearly 2 years to have this hearing, having filed the appeal in December of 2007. My hearing was originally scheduled on May 19, but my lawyer was not notified a vocational expert would be testifying on behalf of the government and did not have the correct files to cross-examine her with, so my hearing was postponed until today, September 8.It was rather predictable with the judge asking me questions about the various positions I was fired from. Of course he did not want to hear about all the jobs I had been fired from previous to 1994, so I was only allowed to testify as to the 3 jobs that I was fired from since 1994 (excluding the job I was partially fired from and was forced to resign from because things were so bad there). Naturally he wanted to know why I was able to work at a couple of jobs for a fairly substantial long time since 1994 why I could not go out and try again. I told him the truth, that with my disability, I would always be limited in the job market and would risk being fired or having problems on the job and I was sick of struggling and believed I was entitled to SSDI. He asked me about my self-stimulatory behaviors. I explained them to him. He commented on the fact that I was not doing them at that moment. I told him that I had some control over it to a limited extent, but did not do it all the time. I think the judge was rather cynical and felt I appeared \"normal\" to him.There was a vocational expert there who testified in favor of the government as well as a medical expert who was a licensed psychologist who testified over the telephone and was heard through a phone speaker.The vocational expert basically stated that even though I could no longer do medical transcription that she believed I could do some more menial job such as janitorial work or doing packaging or being a washing machine loader in a dry cleaners. Of course these vocational experts don\u2019t take into account that at any job like that which I would apply to I would have to explain why I left medical transcription and would have to think up some sort of excuse or tell them the truth about my disability which would automatically forfeit my chances of getting that job. It is also quite likely I would have impairments in these jobs as well. Even if I didn\u2019t, once my self-stimulatory behaviors, loud voice and other problems came out in the wash, they would find some excuse for firing me.My lawyer asked me questions about how I got along with supervisors in the workplace and if I was sensitive to criticism when the errors I made in my work were criticized. I spoke of the one incident where my assistant supervisor at one job while reprimanding me about a mistake told me that this is why I had such a bad reputation with certain doctors and I got angry and got into an argument with her.The medical expert (who never met me or saw me in person) testified about my autism and how it would affect my sociability and dysthymia and depression that I was stated to have. Her opinion was entered into the record.One interesting part of my lawyer\u2019s arguments were my scores on the block design subtest on the Wechsler IQ test. This is a test where a diagram of some colored blocks is shown to a testing subject and they are asked to duplicate the diagram. Because of my perceptual motor impairments due to my brain damage, I do very poorly on this test. It was argued that this could be a contributing factor to my impairments in making a living. The psychologist countered that it would probably impair my ability in drafting or architectural type of professions, but not in typing or as a medical transcriptionist. This is an accurate statement on the part of the psychologist. Though I made an excessive amount of errors in various transcribing jobs that I had, it was due to lack of concentration and autistic \"zone-outs\" rather than my perceptual motor impairments.I am atypical from apparently some other autistics in this regard. There are apparently some research studies that have shown that autistics do well in the block design test. Of course these are just some studies that were limited to using certain research subjects and cannot be applied to all autistics.I am happy that it is finally over after waiting for so long. Of course because the hearing is over does not mean the case is over. Because I was able to work at some jobs at a barely acceptable level and my condition basically has stayed the same and has not deteriorated since 1994, I certainly don\u2019t have an absolutely solid case for being able to get social security disability benefits. There are, however, certain precedents in the law where in certain cases there were favorable rulings for claimants in various court cases due to being fired chronically from jobs, so I do have a legal basis for claiming benefits and/or early retirement.From what I have read, about two-thirds of the people who apply for SSDI are turned down as I was. I still remember two years ago when I first applied for it being struck by the irony that the headquarters for the Lovaas Institute for early intervention was located just down the hall on the same floor of the building that houses the social security office near where I live. I have written about this previously Trying to get social security benefits after having been turned down is an arduous undertaking often taking years.It is quite possible that the reason I was turned down and am having difficulty is because I did work in the past. Basically it is not out of the question that I am being punished from having tried to spare the government the burden of supporting me (aside from the fact I have put thousands of dollars into social security already). I sometimes wonder if I had just applied for this in my 20s before I first attempted to work would I have been saving myself a lot of aggravation. In fact, I think parents of autistic children apply for benefits for their children. Hypothetically maybe this could have been done for me. The problem of course was that I grew up in the Bettelheim generation/era and there was not the same understanding. This was in addition to being very high functioning so my parents would not have known the poor prognosis for my outcome.Do I regret that I tried my best to fight this thing for nearly 28 years? No, absolutely not. I am glad that I had the courage to try hard to work in spite of all of the adversity, the constant firings and the insults I took at times from supervisors and co-workers. Not to mention the tons of interviews where I had to come up with good explanations for my unstable work record, why I got a bachelors in psychology and never did anything with it, the problems of having to fill out job applications with a severe handwriting impairment, the crap I had to put up with from the california state dept of rehabilitation, etc. I was not a complete failure and I was somewhat self supporting from ages 24 to 51. But we all have our breaking point and I have reached mine. I really wish that I could work. I am truly one of the last people in the world who would apply for either SSI or SSDI unless there was a very good reason. But sometimes you just have to call it quits. Of course there is a good chance I will never receive a dime of this money at least until I am eligible for minimum retirement benefits at age 62. If you lose at this level, then there is a written appeal, then after that district court, if you lose there it can be appealed to the federal government circuit court of appeals. One or two of these cases a year are even heard in the supreme court. It is improbable my case will get as far as the supreme court. This means that my fight against the government will likely drag on for many years. So it goes.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/lovaas.html", "http://www.frontiernet.net/~lindaf1/SOCIALSECURITYDISABILITYNIGHTMARE.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/09/my-ssdi-hearing-at-last.html", "title": "\nMy SSDI hearing at last!\n"},
{"date": " September 24, 2009", "body": "\nI was very pleased to see that a member of the neurodiversity movement, Alan Griswold, has shown some good common sense, a rarity for any of them. Alan writes the autistic aphorisms blog. Though I don't agree with a lot of what he says, I find the stuff he writes interesting and I have provided a link to his blog on autism's gadfly.As those who read autism blogs are well aware, autism speaks has come out with a new and controversial video extolling the negatives of autism. Predictably, those who have a neurodiversity perspective are incensed about the video and are trying to get it removed as they did with the ransom note ad and the kidnapping sign that the York Pennsylvania chapter of the autism society posted along a highway.Alan has written an open letter to Laurent Mottron urging him to decline receiving further funding from autism speaks. He has not written a similar open letter to Michelle Dawson, however, I left a comment on his blog urging him to do so. This would make good sense as it would seem that the need for funding of research has trumped the moral principles of both Dr. Mottron and his sidekick Michelle Dawson. When I asked Ms. Dawson about why she would not resign from the Mottron group in protest her explanation was \"science isn't politics\". I have been very curious as to why autism speaks would give Dr. Mottron half a million dollars when he has stated that curing autism is nonsensical and that autism isn't harmful and that autism is not a dysfunction but merely a difference. This certainly is not the point of view of autism speaks, judging by the current video they have made.Though I disagree with Alan on many topics, I do agree with him that ceasing to accept funding from autism speaks would be the honorable thing for Dr. Mottron to do, as he clearly does not agree with the agenda of this organization. It would also be the honorable and ethical thing for Michelle Dawson to resign from the Mottron group since she has stated that she believes autism speaks wishes a very short future for those with autism. Given the fact that she makes such a big deal about ethics, it would increase her credibility even further if she were to discontinue working with Mottron, Jocelyn Faber, Isabelle Souleries and other AS funded researchers until they cease to get funding from AS. Also Michelle has recently been posting deragatory things about the new controversial video on her TMOB comment board. I won't link to these, but I have a link to her comment board on my blog and the interested reader can link and read what she is saying about the new video.I am glad Alan has written that open letter and posted the problem with the Mottron group accepting funding from AS. If Dr. Mottron discontinued to accept or receive funding from AS then the money could go to sane scientists who have the common sense to realize that autism is harmful and how much a cure is needed.I won't hold my breath waiting for either Mottron to quit accepting funding or Michelle to resign though.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticaphorisms.blogspot.com/2009/09/open-letter-to-laurent-mottron.html", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2008/06/epidemiology-of-autism-speaks.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/09/good-common-sense-from-member-of.html", "title": "\ngood common sense from a member of neurodiversity\n"},
{"date": " September 28, 2009", "body": "\nI see from reading Alan Griswold's autistic aphorisms blog and the infamous \"execute pro-cure autistics and turn them into cat food\" autism bitch from hell's blog that Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer of autism speaks, has written a canned response to the various pro-neurodiversity anti-cure proponents who took umbrage to autism speaks' I am autism video:Thank you very much for sending me your letter and telling me about your perspective and feelings regarding the \u201cI Am Autism\u201d video. I understand and respect your perspective and I am truly sorry that the film offended you. The video was not intended to reflect Autism Speaks broader viewpoint or attitude toward persons with autism spectrum disorder. Rather, it was created by two fathers of children with autism \u2013 Billy Mann, a Grammy-nominated songwriter, music producer and Autism Speaks board member, and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, an Academy award-nominated film director. It is based on a personal poem written by Mr. Mann. It is an intensely personal expression by these two fathers. It was their hope that the piece would inspire other voices and artists in the autism community. It has greatly offended some people, however, and we have removed it from our website.Again, thank you for writing to me and sharing your thoughts. You can rest assured that I will continue to advocate for a respectful and compassionate attitude and support for persons with autism spectrum disorder.While Geri Dawson's statement that AS removed the video from their website may not have been an outright and deliberate lie as they did kowtow to the ND fringe and removed it from their home page, the statement was not factually accurate as they still have the video on a more obscure place on the webpage. Both ABFH and Janet Norman-Bain have called Dr. Dawson on this fact.Geri Dawson and autism speaks have nothing to apologize for in making this video. Drastic videos showing what a horrific disability autism is are certainly necessary to generate funding so that research can be done that will cure or at least find a way to mitigate this horrific disability at some point in time. Instead of trying to dissassociate AS in general from the videos and just attribute this to the two filmmakers only makes AS and Geri Dawson look obsequious and reduces their credibility as a fundraising organization which claims that they are looking for a cure. There is no need to mollify these people. Certainly persons such as ABFH who suggest executing me and turning me into catfood is a good idea are not even worth trying to have a respectful dialogue with. Her offense at this video should be taken with a pillar not a grain of salt.Unfortunately this letter only kowtows to this fringe cult who don't want autistics and others with related disorders to have a shot of living a decent life and want the pain and suffering that autism causes to continue. While I realize it might be impolitic of her to tell Alan Griswold, ABFH and others to fuck off this is the attitude that they should take.Another alternative would have been the type of response Jon Shestack gave me when I first met him in the pre autism speaks days when his CAN was neurodiversity's favorite whipping boy. I pointed out to him that there were some people with autism that did not like what he was doing. He replied: \"Their problems are nowhere near as severe as my son's are and if they don't like what I am doing, too bad.\" I realize this response might be considered impolitic also, but certainly it is the attitude that autism speaks should take and yes, Geraldine Dawson should have just said, 'too bad' if you don't like our video.Or perhaps the most diplomatic and politic response would be that autism is a serious problem for at least some, even if the mild ASD's that ND's or their relatives have in many cases that they can respect the rights of others to pursue fund raising the way the other side sees fit whose problems are far more serious than theirs are.Anyone who can read between the lines can see what a disingenuous snow job Dawson's canned response was. In addition to the inaccuracy of her statement that the video had been removed from AS' website, certainly this video reflects the overall view of autism speaks as well as likely most of the relatives of autistic persons who go on walks for AS or donate money to them. There is no reason for AS to soften the tone of their message of what a horrific disability this is ,nor to worry about offending persons in the fringe cult of ND. A respectful and compassionate attitude towards those with autism is not taking an ND perspective but acknowledging the harsh realities of autism, the fact that it is a disease, a disorder and not merely a difference and funding scientific research that might enable them to live better lives and maybe even ultimately find a cure.Addendum: Clay Adams was kind enough to point out to me that I originally misspelled kowtow as cowtow, an error true, but I suspect a common one. Though I appreciate Clay bringing the error to my attention, I usually won't publish his comments on autism's gadfly.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/09/autism-speaks-cowtows-to-neurodiversity.html", "title": "\nAutism speaks kowtows to neurodiversity\n"},
{"date": " September 22, 2009", "body": "\nHere is a studythat has recently been done in England finding a prevalence rate of 1% of adults with autism, suggesting that there has never been an increase in prevalence of autism as many have suggested. I did not read the whole study in detail but did surface read it, and it seemed that they surveyed a variety of people all over England. There was about a 9:1 ratio of males to females rather than the usual 4:1 ratio and this may have been because of the sampling size, I am not sure. I tried to read it in detail, but my disability made it hard for me to comprehend the entire thing and have all of it sink in. I was debating whether or not to blog about it, but I have decided to anyhow in spite of my concentration problems. This may not be the survey or study to end all survey/studies and I am sure this won't convince the age of autism folks as well as others who believe in an \"epidemic\" of autism involving huge increases (I don't think anything will ever convince them), but it may give some evidence that there has always been a high and stable rate of autism and disprove that vaccines or something else in the environment caused an autism explosion in the late 1980's, early 1990s.The environmental hypothesis has appeal among its adherents, however, due to the fact that it provides the possibility of finding a single cause for most ASD's and with the cause, the treatment or possibly even cure can be found.One of the arguments that those who have this point of view is that there are no comparable numbers of adults with autism. Even though this survey may not prove that conclusively, I think it is the first published survey of its kind that has been done trying to get an assessment of what the prevalence of autism is in older populations. To date, as far as I know, the other side has never done such as study.Mark Blaxill has given the arguments that a study done by Bard et. al. in a rural part of North Dakota in which they tried to find additional persons with autism diagnoses after the prevalence of a certain sample was obtained in the cohort's childhood, they failed to find any new cases. The problem with this one study was that it was done in a rural area where the prevalence rates for autism are low. If numbers of autistic persons has actually increased it has been in urban areas. For example in the 2007 CDC survey much higher rates were found in New Jersey than in Alabama. In California's regional centers, the autism prevalence is much higher in Los Angeles than in rural parts of Northern California. Some might argue that this is due to more pollutants being found in urban parts of california or a higher rate of pollution in New Jersey than in Alabama. Be that as it may, so far no one has found any pollutant in the environment that has caused this increase. If vaccination rates are much higher in New Jersey than in Alabama and much higher in Los Angeles than in rural parts of Northern California, I have yet to see evidence of this.Another piece of evidence that Blaxill gave was a study done by Nylander in Sweden where the author searched for persons with autism in psychiatric hospitals and found low prevalences there. Aside from the fact that autistic adults may not be inclined to present in psychiatric hospitals in great numbers, particularly if they are pretty high functioning, we see some inconsistencies in Blaxill's reasoning. In some personal correspondence that he and I engaged in about six years ago he stated that the evidence for a true epidemic of autism was that the increases were geographically specific, only taking place in the USA and UK and not other parts of the world. So, it would seem strange that he would cite a study in an area he had deemed geographically irrelevant.So, I suggest that the age of autism folks or one of their allies does their own study, refuting the recent British survey showing that the prevalence rate of autism in persons born in 1986 and earlier is in fact lower than in the younger cohorts.I was skeptical that finding the autistic adults was feasible, since they are not likely to present to special education services and regional centers and such.I am glad that studies are finally being undertaken to find the so-called hidden horde of autistic adults. I have written about the reasons previouslyI apologize to readers of autism's gadfly that I was not able to read and understand the study in more detail. Hopefully more work will be done in this area and we can determine whether or not the prevalence rate is the same in older populations than in younger.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/publications/mental%20health/mental%20health%20surveys/Autism_Spectrum_Disorders_in_adults_living_in_households_throughout_England_Report_from_the_Adult_Psychiatric_Morbidity_Survey_2007.pdf", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/hidden-horde.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/09/has-autisms-hidden-horde-been-found-in.html", "title": "\nHas autism's hidden horde been found in England?\n"},
{"date": " September 28, 2009", "body": "\nDoing medical transcription was what I did before I stopped working because it was too difficult. Medical transcription is the job of transcribing doctor\u2019s dictation into medical records. For example when you go to the hospital, there is a record that the hospital is legally required to keep called a discharge summary. This tells about what happened when you were in the hospital, all the tests you took, your condition, etc. Or when you have surgery, a record called an operative report is required. Also sometimes histories and physicals, where the doctor tells about the history of your illness and your results on physical examinations. There are also other types of medical transcriptions including clinic things and workers' comp reports which are easier than the hospital transcription.In 1985 I was unemployed and having a hard time making a living. It was recommended that I undergo training with the state of California department of rehabilitation which is designed to help disabled people find work. They recommended that due to my typing ability I go into medical transcription. I was treated very badly by the department of rehabilitation I have written about this elsewhere and it does not need repeating here In spite of what these bastards/bitches did, I was able to find an entry level gig in medical transcription. It was as an independent contractor doing hospital transcription for a transcription service.I was paid on production (standard way of paying transcriptionists) a low rate $.06/line, a line being 65 characters. I probably made about $1.50 an hour when I was first doing it.In addition to male transcriptionists being a very small minority, the work was incredibly difficult. It involved having to know tens of thousands of arcane medical words and phrases and knowing how to spell them properly. Some of the doctors were from foreign countries and had accents that were horrifically hard to understand. Even some American doctors would slur their words, mumble and often be unintelligible. I knew I had an uphill battle if I were to be able to be a hospital transcriptionists, but all my life I have worked hard and given everything my damndest in spite of this horrific disability.The pay was solely on production, though the work was not uniform. For example a person could make a substantially higher rate of pay from much longer reports than from shorter reports or if the doctor dictating the report was clear and easier to understand than other doctors. Some of the jobs were independent contract rather than being an employee, so you had to pay double the social security tax, there was no workers\u2019 comp insurance and no paid vacations. Most ironic of all there were no benefits, so a person doing work indispensable to the medical profession sometimes had no employer provided medical insurance. There were other expenses that I had to incur later on, but more about that later.The work at my first gig slowed down and then I tried to find some other things and I was fired from some places but managed to find a few places that would allow me to work for them. I was tired of making a poverty wage, so I tried to find something better, in spite of my lack of experience. I was fired again from various places. I had no idea how people were able to transcribe these unintelligible doctors and do this job correctly. Eventually I found a medical group which was clinic work and somewhat easier than the hospital stuff. There was an Indian doctor there who I had a hard time with and he insisted the other transcriptionist there do his work. I had some trouble with a few other doctors and got fired from there after about a year and a half. I had various other jobs and came very close to giving up the ghost.After a succession of jobs I acquired an independent contract job doing hospital work, though fortunately no operative reports in which my experience was limited. I worked at home for the first time rather than in an office and I had to provide my own reference books. All of the necessary references books cost between $400-500. On top of this I had to put an additional telephone land line in my home and pay for it and I obtained the work through a device called a C phone. I had to rent this from the people I contracted for, for about $30 a month. The other option was to buy one new for $800. I had to do this work through the telephone lines and no toll free number was provided by the hospital. Fortunately it was still feasible to do this work as the hospital was a toll free number from where I lived. After being fired from this job, then reinstated, I learned I was required to buy my own C phone as supposedly the people I worked for could not legally rent one to me as I was an independent contractor.Used, this was about $500. I had no idea where I could have obtained one more cheaply. I was able to do more lines at this job than at the others I had and my gross pay was probably $15-16 an hour or maybe more on good runs. Of course you had to deduct about 5% of that for the additional social security tax I was forced to pay as a legally self-employed person. Eventually this gig ended when Kaiser Permanente (I did the transcription for one of the chains of hospital this HMO giant has) acquired a new \"health connect\" system which cut our work by about 50% or more. I was not able to find another job and keep it.As my regular readers know I have retired and for the past two years since I have retired I have been trying to qualify for SSDI which I am not likely to ever receive. C phones have become largely obsolete and transcription is now received through digitized .wav files. This meant that I was stuck with a $500 investment that I could not recoup anything on. I did try to sell my reference books on Craig\u2019s list for a while but had no success.I remember hearing about how Temple Grandin was claiming that medical transcription was among one of the bad jobs for an autistic person because of hearing sensitivity issues. I had to laugh at that, because albeit not perfect it was a good job for me, because I could do all the work without having to interact with others most of the time, especially when I worked at home. The joke was on me when I met Grandin last year at the 2008 ASA conference in Orlando, Florida and told her what my former profession was and how it had not completely worked out, and she reiterated her old saw about how I had entered a bad profession for an autistic person.Of course, one can look at the perspective of the glass being half full. I did work a good portion of the time although it was difficult, but I did better at this than anything else and this did allow me to work for a period of time, although not until I would be old enough to receive retirement social security.Though retirement has its nice aspects, I do miss working a bit. Working certainly helps people with self-esteem and self-worth. Lately I have been trying to pass the time by writing a novel. Actually I should be working on the novel instead of this blog post. However, I will post more about this in the future, maybe tomorrow, stay tuned.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/09/sometimes-i-still-think-about-medical.html", "title": "\nSometimes I still think about medical transcription\n"},
{"date": " October 1, 2009", "body": "\nTo Anyone It May Concern:I am a person with a neurologic impairment that presents with autistic symptoms, such as self-stimulatory behaviors and impairments in the social sphere who has a fine motor coordination impairment and perceptual motor impairment. This greatly impairs my ability to handwrite and put together puzzles and do other types of motor activities. I also had trouble learning how to tie my shoes which I was not able to do at all until I was about 8 years old. To this day, I still have trouble tying a knot very tightly and the laces in my tennis shoes often become loose and have to be retied. Also, my gross motor coordination is probably below average in that I have never been very athletic, but it is not as bad as my fine motor coordination.On psychological testing, I score approximately 40 points higher on my verbal Wechsler IQ than on my performance IQ. On two of the subtests of the Wechsler performance, the object assembly and block design tests, I score in the severely retarded range. This is contrary to the findings of Uta Frith and other autism researchers who have found that a number of persons diagnosed with autism score in the superior range in the block design test.I also have an abnormal score on the Bender-Gestalt test, making many more errors than a non-handicapped person. At one time, this test was considered definitive evidence that I have a brain dysfunction.Alan Lincoln, a psychologist who used to work with Eric Courchesne, suggested this meant that I had Asperger's syndrome rather than classic autism as persons with Asperger's have been noted to be clumsy. One problem with this is that I had a speech delay at about age 2-1/2 (or perhaps younger), and Asperger's and regular autism are usually differentiated from each other by lack of speech delay in the former.I think a good number of persons with autism have good manual dexterity and have no trouble putting together puzzles. In fact some persons diagnosed with autism have extraordinary talents for drawing. Two examples of this are Stephen Wiltshire and the lesser known Stephanie Lynn Keil.At one time I have been classified as \"fine motor coordination problem\". I was also told that I have a perceptual problem. In my readings (which may be limited) I have never really come across a diagnosis like this, except occasionally for case reports of persons with Tourette's syndrome or ADHD who had problems with handwriting or fine motor coordination.I have also heard of something called nonverbal learning disability. I am not sure if this applies to my symptoms or not.In my readings of perceptual problems, they have always seemed to apply to persons with dyslexia or perhaps other types of reading difficulties. I have never read about perceptual problems applying to fine motor coordination skills or abilities to put puzzles together or do block designs correctly.I was wondering if anyone knows about autistics with fine motor coordination problems or problems with block design test, if there is anything in the academic literature that has been published about this or if anyone can tell me more about perceptual problems that don't affect reading ability but affect the ability to put together puzzles etc.If anyone has some information about this I would appreciate it if they could post a comment here or send me email.Much thanks,Jon Mitchell\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/10/wanted-info-on-fine-motor-coordination.html", "title": "\nwanted, info on fine motor coordination and low score on block design test, etc.\n"},
{"date": " September 29, 2009", "body": "\nI recently came across an interesting piece about some autistics in the workplace. These always hit home with me because of the tremendous employment problems that I have had as well as the simplistic quick fixes that are given by so many, such as disclosure and Temple Grandin's things about mentors.I see that neurodiversity's lead spokesperson, Ari Ne'eman has decided to give his $.02 worth when he was interviewed by the author of this article.Ne'eman states:Aside from communication barriers, other challenges can impede autistic workers, such as sensory sensitivity to fluorescent lights or inability to understand directions for a job, said Ari Ne\u2019eman, a 21-year-old with autism who grew up in East Brunswick and founded The Autistic Self Advocacy Network.even more intriguing statement from Ne'eman:Social pleasantry should be eliminated as criteria for hiring and a good job evaluation, Ne\u2019eman said.For those who don't know, Ne'eman is a 21 (maybe 22) year old kid who has never had a job of any kind or made a dollar in his life from working-at least he acknowledged this the last time I had contact with him and discussed this issue, though I realize this may have changed. Even if Ne'eman's situation has changed (which I doubt), he still has essentially no actual work experience.As a person on the spectrum (autism not Asperger's syndrome unlike Ne'eman) who has been fired from nearly 20 jobs, yet who did manage to work sporadically for more years than Ne'eman has been alive, I resent him trying to give input on the autistics in the workplace. Never having worked, he knows nothing of the problems that people with disabilities face in the workplace. He is totally ignorant of anything involving working for a paycheck and making a living.Apparently from these statements we see that Ne'eman feels that it is okay for an employee to behave on the job in any manner in which they choose if they have autism. Interestingly enough this does not jive at all with his previous statements that insanity defenses should be done away with for people on the spectrum charged with crimes as this will cause them not to have equality with NTs.Ne'eman wrote:If Asperger\u2019s is a justifiable excuse for criminal action, what right do we have to demand an equal place in a society of law-abiding human beings? When a college student caught engaging in arson suddenly claims Asperger\u2019s so as to avoid being held accountable for his actions, what does it say about all other law abiding autistics? Someone working in a customer service or waitressing job should just be able to tell the customer to \"fuck off\" if they are autistic or Asperger's and feel like doing this. If the employer were to fire them, they would be a bigot, violating this autistic person's civil rights.Well, as one of my favorite human beings, Clay Adams, would say, wish in one hand, shit in the other and see which one fills up first. Ne'eman and the ND movement are dreaming if they think this is ever going to happen. That society will accommodate people with autism no matter how they behave and how offensive their behavior is.Even more intriguing than Ne'eman's inconsistent statements saying ASD'ers should be culpable for crimes they have committed is that these statements about social unpleasantries being overlooked are totally inconsistent with previous statements he has made on this same subject in the past, which come from the previous link:If Asperger\u2019s means an inability to help breaking the law, all of us are incapable of avoiding lawbreaking. As someone who hopes to work in law eventually, I am not too keen on the message this sends to my future prospective employers. \u201cAsperger\u2019s autistics,\u201d says this argument, \u201care a risk to your workplace environment. They could go off at any moment- it\u2019s just who they are.\u201dNe'eman, who has commented that because of Allison Tepper Singer's admittedly dumb remark, that this caused a bunch of parents of autistic children to go out and murder their children and that autism speaks is morally complicit with murder, certainly knows about making a faux pas. Perhaps he is worried that when he actually goes out into the world and tries to support himself that he might get into trouble due to some sort of social skill impairment his Asperger's causes him. Perhaps this is why he is so concerned about employer's judging employees by their social pleasantries.Of course the ND philosopy on John Best (a possible spectrumite) is not consistent with this. John Best's caustic speech and blog posts towards the ND's he despises so much are not overlooked by Ari Ne'eman and the others. Virtually all of them have banned him from their blogs, constantly vilify him and never overlook his mean behavior. Perhaps the ND's should practice what they preach. If that were the case Best's lack of social pleasantry in his posts would be overlooked and all of the ND bloggers would welcome him with open arms rather than banning him.But these sort of inconsistencies and crapolla are par for the course for ND.

{"date": " October 14, 2009", "body": "\nOne of the controversies that the neurodiversity movement has brought to the forefront in the past is the question of why autism speaks' board of directors does not include someone on the spectrum themselves. They feel that the name of the organization is ironic in that it disenfranchises those with autism for that reason.When various persons, mostly neurodiversity believing persons on the spectrum, complained about this, I suggested that they contact autism speaks and ask them why there were no board members with autism. At the time, as far as I knew, AS had never been contacted and asked this question. Janet Norman Bain (AKA Jypsy) wrote a comment on autism's gadfly stating that she had in fact sent AS email asking them the question, and had only received a curt form email thanking her for sending them the email and had never directly received a reply. Michelle Dawson also stated that she had asked officials at autism speaks the question and they had just stated they were happy without any board members on the spectrum. Michelle then seemed to imply that I was giving inaccurate information, though I had no way of knowing either Jypsy or Michelle had asked this question.Mike Stanton took my advice and sent an email asking autism speaks this question. Apparently they never answered him either. Both Jypsy and Mike seemed to think the onus was on me to dig up the answer because I had blogged about it. I respectfully disagreed, but told them that I occasionally ran into Jon Shestack and Portia Iversen at certain autism-related things and although I did not know them very well, if I ever saw them again I would ask, but not go out of my way to find out. I told them if I ever got a response that I would post it here on autism's gadfly.I recently wrote a post about one spectrumite who seemed he might be a candidate for the board of directors of AS in the foreseeable future. As luck would have it, Jon Shestack read this blog entry and weighed in about the question of persons with autism (at least those with an ND perspective) serving on the board. In case Mike and Jypsy have not read the comment by Mr. Shestack, I feel that I should print it here in order to keep my promise to them. Given that Mr. Shestack is a member of the board himself, what he said may be of interest:I recognize that ND folks has real issues. Humiliations and unfairnesses abound. But they help no one by going on the board of mainstream autism organizations. These organizations are set up to help people who are fundamentally different. Who are for the most part dependent on others. Who can not get married, communicate, or perform useful work unaided.What the mainstream autism organizations need is to make sure that actual parents and siblings, people with firsthand exposure to the disorder and who also have real credentials as activists are represented in the decision making process, particularly the scientific funding process. AS and Simons run the risk of becoming like NIH, institutional echo chambers where new ideas get drowned out by the old voices.The ND activists have no desire to foster research and they should stay away from organizations where that is the main goal. But they do seem very concerned with rights and perception, and I feel that they have had a great influence in these areas very quickly. It would be great to see the ND community coalesce and concentrate on those issues and not muddy the waters and inflict emotional hurt on those families that are desperately searching for a cure and a better life for their children.I disagreed with Jon's statement about the ND's not being interested in scientific research and pointed out the nearly half million dollar grant that AS had recently given Laurent Mottron and the persons who work with him. Though I agreed it would be a laudable goal for ND just to concentrate on human rights and dignity for persons with autism and not inflict abuse on families wishing for a cure and a better life for autistic children I pointed out to him that this is quite unrealistic.Other than these two points of contention, this seemed like quite a good response to me. It also seemed quite a magnanimous response on his part, considering in the days before Allison Tepper Singer this man (and possibly his wife) has received more vilification than any other autism figure. He has been called a Nazi, Hitler incarnate and autism diva once called him \"a spoiled Hollywood type\".One of the reasons that ND may have expressed an interest in a position on the AS board is they believe this will give them some power. Roger Kulp seemed to think that ND was trying to take over autism speaks by infiltration. As far as Roger's notion being accurate and whether or not Mike Carley would be able to sway AS to an ND agenda, Mr. Shestack again gave his input.As for the notion that the ND people will take over As through infiltration, surely you jest. I founded CAN and the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange, and helped get the children's health act passed and am on the executive committee of AS and I have had a minimal bordering on nonexistent effect on its policy.As for being a member of the AS board, membership for Mr Carley will not advance the ND position or Mr Carley personally. Though he will certainly be asked to fundraise.Though I realize that this does not give an out and out answer to the question of why there are no autistics on the board of directors of autism speaks, it does partially answer it I believe. If others in power at AS feel the same way as Mr. Shestack does then perhaps, they feel that having an autistic (at least one with an ND perspective) does not help their organization as they have different goals and he feels these people aren't helping themselves either.It would also seem that being on the board of directors does not wield the power that persons who have asked about that seem to think it does. Jonathan Shestack is certainly in a position to know as well or better than anyone else. Instead an ND board member on the spectrum would be asked to engage in what would probably be to them the drudgery of having to get money into the organization and not reaping what they perceive as the benefits. So ND again might be careful what they wish for.This is the best response to this question I have been able to get so far. If any other breakthroughs are made I will post about them on autism's gadfly. I hope Jon Shestack won't mind my bringing attention to him in this post and printing out his comments from another post.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/10/as-board-member-gives-take-about.html", "title": "\nAS board member gives take about autistics on the board\n"},

{"date": " October 5, 2009", "body": "\nOne of the many complaints that neurodiversity proponents have about their favorite organization, autism speaks, is their apparent belief that AS disenfranchises those with autism in that no members of the board of directors are actually on the spectrum themselves.For some reason that remains a mystery to your humble blogger it is more important to these people to have someone serve as board of director of an organization to whose goals they have overt hostility than it is for autism speaks to employ someone with autism in their organization. I am not sure what the unemployment rate is among persons with autism, but it is a good guess that it is mighty high. I have previously written about the autism and the workplace promotion (which I won't link to) done by autism speaks in spite of the salient absence of a paid autistic employee in their group.One of the arguments made for putting a spectrumite on the board of directors of AS is that other autism organizations have persons on the spectrum in position of power. For example one of the board members of ASA is Valerie Paradiz, a Ph.D. in German literature, a former college professor, published author of a memoir and now an autism consultant and lecturer. She makes the claim (which I am skeptical of) that she herself is on the spectrum. I am mystified how this person gives a voice to someone like Dov Shestack or John Belmonte or any other non-speaking person with autism who requires round-the-clock care. Or even for someone on the spectrum relatively high functioning such as myself.It seems as though persons with autism who believe in an neurodiversity perspective may have cause to celebrate. It would seem that one of their own, Michael John Carley, who like Dr. Paradiz has a published memoir and is an autism lecturer (though not sure if he is a consultant) seems to have quite a friendly relationship with autism speaks. He has had AS president, Mark Roithmayr give his book a shout-out. He and former autism speaks executive, Allison Tepper Singer exchanged some articles of understanding in which they publicly exchanged views.Given the controversy over the recent \"I am autism\" video. Carley has weighed in with his perspective. A neurodiversity blogger, Sarah, a cat in a dog's world, hasgiven her take on Carley's perspective. We see from reading this that though Carley has never met Bob or Suzanne Wright he has met their grandson. So, there seems to be a friendship between Carley and some persons in AS. (though Tepper-Singer is no longer with the organization). Carley has tried to talk up autism speaks. He has disingenuously claimed that they are talking less about a cure. Sarah correctly called him on this.One place where Carley did hit the nail on the head was his assertion that certain individuals were jealous of the Wright's financial situation. Now this is probably the real reason ND wants an autistic person on the board-particularly an autistic who shares their perspective. They can't acquire the capital for their activities, so by getting on the board of autism speaks, they will be in a better position to acquire it for their own ends.Carley talks about how the research autism speaks will have some sort of global benefit. This is in spite of the fact that he has spoken for all autistics preaching the familiar \"acceptance not cure\" mantra on radio interviews. In his book \"Asperger's from the Inside out\" Carley has claimed that there is a universal feeling among those on the spectrum that they should not be cured. Naturally he neglected to consult either Roger Kulp or myself or any other pro-cure autistic.Carley who was able to get married, have children, work in a decent paying job and likely never spent a day of his life in a special education school, did not find out he had AS until age 36. Only after his son was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. This is the reason I only read bits and portions of his book and not the entire book. I do not feel he has anything to offer to me about information about the spectrum on a personal level.For these reasons, it concerns me that he actually has a shot of being the first person claiming to be on the spectrum who will gain one of the coveted board of directors positions at autism speaks.One would think that neurodiversity would be celebrating and dancing in the street that one of their own has a realistic shot of getting that big score, one of their own, being on the board. Apparently not. Sarah has certainly called him to task. The much nastier ND, \"the autistic bitch from hell\" has not minced her own words and has referred to Carley as a \"curebie suckup\" and a \"quisling\", slurs that the ND community has called your humble blogger in the past.Carley's ND detractors rightfully see him as someone who may have an ulterior motive in being involved with a pro-cure organization when Carley himself has said that a cure should not be found. Carley, an author, and autism lecturer, it would seem, makes a good portion of his living on the backs of persons with Asperger's and autism. He sees what a good idea it is to get involved with this organization. Amazing, Sarah, ABFH and I all agree on something! So, apparently Carley's appointment to the board won't shut up the ND lobbyists who so adamantly insist that one of their own be appointed to the board of directors.Carley's behavior may be, however, what it takes to get one of their own on the board. Here you have it ND's, one of your own may soon be on the board of autism speaks. He will lobby for acceptance rather than cure in the board meetings.

{"date": " October 25, 2009", "body": "\nGadfly has come back after a brief hiatus. I have found an interesting piece about bullying of an autistic that I thought I might weigh in on.Whenever I state my views about neurodiversity, stating that I long for a cure (though I concede it is unlikely it will be found in my lifetime), disputing their social model of disability, refuting their lies such as that Vernon Smith and Richard Borcherds were ever diagnosed as being on the spectrum by clinicians, their claims that autistic people can do just fine with the right supports and Ari Ne'eman's claims in the despicable No Myths video that the prognosis for most persons on the spectrum is not poor, etc, the response from neurodiversity is quite predictable. I am bombarded by the strawman that because I am opposed to these notions that I am against human rights for persons with autism, that neurodiversity is nothing more than the idea that autistic lives are worthwhile and they are entitled to  certain human rights.Interestingly enough, though bullying is often a problem for those on the spectrum, at least during childhood and adolescence, myself included, I seldom hear anything about it from members of the ND movement. I usually hear the arguments about how vaccines don't cause autism, there has never been an autism epidemic, and how hateful it is for those to claim that they could possibly be \"toxic\". I also hear about what a horrible organization autism speaks is, what a horrible person Jon Shestack is for wanting to cure his son, who can't speak or dress himself or do anything without an aide.How about bullying or other human rights violations that persons with autism have to endure? As the old lady in the Wendy's television commercial would say, \"Where's the beef?\"Patrick Fuglei's case is an example of this. A boy who had no friends and is so anxious to fit in, he does not mind other kids calling him \"retard\". He has such poor social judgment that when students have told him he should tell a pretty girl how much he would like to see her naked he will do it. When taunted by other kids that he had a vagina, he was challenged to prove them wrong. He accepted the challenge, dropping his pants, showing them he had no vagina, right in the middle of the playground. This is really no different than rearranging the furniture in a blind person's home when you think about it. His parents attempted to mainstream him hoping that he could have a normal life as possible and be in a school with his non handicapped peers, but this did not work out. The teasing and taunts got so bad he had to leave the school (with the very ironic name of Hellgate) . He will be attending a special ed school for autistic persons in another state where his grandparents live. Seems sad that a kid like this has to live in a different state from his parents because his human rights have been ignored by everyone including those in the neurodiversity movement.The article also states that Patrick wishes to be \"normal\". Apparently he is another autistic, who missed the neurodiversity polls in which they claimed most don't want to be cured.This article does hit home with me. I had to end up going to a school outside of my school district because I was receiving so much bullying and harassment from other kids. This was after I left special school. Of course, it is a myth that special ed kids are not picked on by other special ed kids, so Patrick may be disappointed at his special ed placement.One reason that the ND's don't care is that many of them are bullies themselves. It would seem anyone on the spectrum who desires a cure incurs their wrath and becomes a target. I have been the victim of internet bullying among a number of members of the autism hub which represents blogs where the neurodiversity bloggers congregate. Parents are bullied by the august bloggers Kowalski and Turner. I have written about these two unsavory characters previously. I have been told by Dave Seidel, one of the hub administrators, that membership in the hub requires consensus among all the bloggers in the hub. Therefore we can judge them by the company they keep. It would seem the hub denizens not only do not care about bullying but rather promote it.I realize that it is possible that many of them were bullied themselves. This is probably not an uncommon phenomena. They were bullied and projected their anger onto others more vulnerable so they became bullies themselves.If Ari Ne'eman, Dave Seidel, or Michelle Dawson or any other ND who claims their movement is about human rights happens to read this, how about Pat Fuglei, what about his human rights?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.missoulian.com/news/local/article_2ca0d8f8-c129-11de-b225-001cc4c03286.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/10/does-neurodiversity-give-s-about.html", "title": "\nDoes neurodiversity give a s*** about Patrick Fuglei?\n"},
{"date": " December 1, 2009", "body": "\nI see the never employed 21-year-old Ari Ne'eman is at it again. Ari Ne'eman seems to once again offer his expertise on the subject of employment, something he knows of not one iota, never having been employed in his life. I've previously written about Ne'eman's trying to make himself out to be an expert in this subject of which he does not know from shoe polish. The media exposure happy Ne'eman gave an interview to a New Jersey newspaper in which he offered his own input on the workplace. Not as anything more than an ivory tower observer, let alone someone (myself) who has had many years of experience in the workplace experiencing these problems first hand that happens to those on the spectrum. Now, Mr. Ne'eman is offering his $.02 worth (and even this price tag is being exceedingly generous to Ne'eman) by giving testimony before the EEOC.Ne'eman starts off by stating that all autism spectrum disorders should be included under the EEOC's rubric. This is not surprising in that Ne'eman having had speech at age 2-3 and knowing the names of various dinosaurs, would have never had an autism diagnosis based on criteria which was not extant until about 1994. He would still have to say he had Attention deficit disorder and be a crusader for the rights of this group instead.He also talks about a clause in the law that is a 'regarded from' aspect of the disability and states that things like a data entry person being dismissed from their job for not looking the person in the eye be something that is inclusive among autistics. What Ne'eman in his youthful naivete' fails to grasp is that an employer is not going to outright admit to terminating a person's employment because they did not look the employer in the eye. They will come up with an excuse that no matter how bogus will basically be impossible to prove in a court of law or the EEOC or anywhere else where a terminated autistic employee will desire to redress a grievance against a discriminating employer. I know this for a fact because I was fired from a data entry job where a productivity study was falsified against me. Naturally this individual would not come right out and say that he was firing me for being a peculiar person. It would have been certainly infeasible if not impossible for me to disprove this contention and claim that I was being discriminated against.Secondly Ne'eman claims that 30% of companies are offering these personality tests which are irrelevant to performance of a job in question and that due to a person with autism giving undesirable answers they are screened out from a job from which they are qualified. Interestingly, I have had hundreds of job interviews (as opposed to Ari's likely zero) and I can't recall one instance in which I was administered one of these so-called personality tests. I suppose it is possible things could have changed drastically from where 0 to 30% of companies would give these tests in the few years that I have been out of the job market but that seems unlikely to me. What Ne'eman won't acknowledge is the fact that though discrimination exists and is indeed a factor in autistic employment, impairment is a much more poignant issue. The fact that a person with autism actually has a disability that incapacitates their ability to learn and do a job certainly does not jibe with Ne'eman's \"being anti-cure isn't being anti-progress\" mantra. However, Ne'eman wishes to deny me and others the cure that would enable us to be employable. If I had been an extremely good medical transcriptionist, plumber, computer programmer, etc, I would have had no problem keeping a job. It is true I would have faced some discrimination but I would not have been forced out of the workplace at a relatively young age. This is likely true for most if not all persons on the autistic spectrum.I personally have little faith in the ADA or the EEOC in being able to do anything to help autistics secure employment. But Ne'eman's big government intervention policies help him conveniently avoid the issues of an autistic person actually not being able to work aside from discrimination. I do not believe that these federal laws that supposedly protect disabled individuals in the workplace are enforceable. This goes along with my nearly 28 years of experience of having actually worked with this handicap, being fired from multiple jobs and having applied for many many more.Ari Ne'eman I know you read this blog and I would appreciate it if you and ASAN would do us all a favor and not try to talk about work related issues until you have actually gone out into the world and worked as an employee yourself.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://asansouthwestohio.blogspot.com/2009/12/employment-discrimination-testimony.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/12/ari-neeman-testifies-before-eeoc.html", "title": "\nAri Ne'eman testifies before the EEOC\n"},
{"date": " November 10, 2009", "body": "\nI have seen that a new study has come out documenting handwriting problems in autistic children. I have had great difficulties with handwriting and printing. Contrary to some published reports of autistic children having superior scores on the block design subtest of the Wechsler performance IQ test, I score in the far subnormal range on this.Also, some persons with autism do have very superior fine motor coordination skills such as Stephen Wiltshire and the lesser known Stephanie Lynn Keil who is also a talented artist.I had to have extra help one on one tutoring for handwriting for years as a small child. I remember one tutor could only tutor me during recess or the school felt it was the only time they could give me the extra help. While the other kids enjoyed a recess break, I had to spend time being tutored in handwriting.I later went to after school to a place where they claimed their educational methods remediated perceptual impairments that caused my handwriting problems (as well as perceptual problems that caused dyslexia which I don't have). This was another example of a pie-in-the-sky special education promise that turned out in reality to be shit-from-the-sewer. They did not help at all.I recently wrote a blog post inquiring about fine motor coordination problems. The diagnosis given to me before the autism diagnosis was \"fine motor coordination problem\".The article states that they got a standard score on the perceptual part of an IQ test. I don't know if this means they had normal scores in block design, etc.So I am still interested in reading about handwriting and motor impairments in autistic children. I guess this shows that while autistics may have some symptoms in common that not all of them are alike and different conditions are labeled \"autism\".I am not sure there is anyway I will ever be able to know exactly how my brain was damaged and what the neuroanatomical correlates are that cause the self-stimulatory movements and handwriting problems and all else that is wrong with me.Still interested in reading this article and finding out about handwriting problems in others.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ajc.com/health/content/shared-auto/healthnews/auti/632844.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/11/handwriting-problems-in-autistic.html", "title": "\nhandwriting problems in autistic children\n"},
{"date": " October 26, 2009", "body": "\nI see that the pharmaceutical company Pfizer has started a new autism unit devoted to trying to find drug treatments or possibly even a cure for autism. Diane Stephenson one of the Pfizer research associates who has started this unit has an autistic nephew who at age 23 has never spoken a word. She also has another younger nephew and niece who have autism, who are the children of another sibling of hers. This has motivated her to do research to find help for these individuals as well as others on the spectrum.I found the following quote from the article particularly interesting:\"Everyone wants a cure,\"(emphasis added) said Stephenson, who has worked at the Groton labs for six years. \"I felt there was something I could do.\"Apparently Ms. Stephenson has never heard of the neurodiversity movement. I wonder what this scientist who has a 23 year old autistic nephew who is completely nonverbal would say, if she discovered there is a cult of individuals who are opposed to curing autism. A cult who believes that to cure someone of this disease is stripping them of their humanity. Who teach 16 year old kids that wanting your loved ones to have the ability to speak who don't have it is \"disgusting drivel\". Who claim that parents of autistic children who want a cure for their children are like members of the Ku Klux Klan who are forced to raise black children. I wonder what Ms. Stephenson's reaction would be if she found out that a half million dollar grant was given by the major private sector funder of autism research to a man claiming the goal of curing autism is nonsensical, who also said that autism is not a dysfunction or disorder but merely a difference and has written that autism isn't harmful.What would Ms. Stephenson think if she found out, an eminent experimental psychologist who gets extensive funding from the government has written that her nonverbal nephew needs acceptance and not a cure and that this psychologist claimed personal experience with autism by having a son with the condition. Unlike Ms. Stephenson's nonverbal nephew at 23, the psychologist's son is a high school senior at age 12.I wonder what the Pfizer scientist would think if she found out that a 21-year-old kid with virtually no life experience was claiming that it was a myth that her nonverbal nephew had no hope and no future.I can't imagine what her reaction (0r her nephew's) would be if she found out there was a group of people who claim the reason that some autistic people wish a cure for their condition is because their mother taught them to hate themselves.Well, there is an old saying, ignorance is bliss.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.courant.com/community/groton/hc-ap-ct-fea-pfizer-autismoct25,0,3266887.story", "http://www.autistics.org/library/acceptance.html", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2009/04/autisms-gadfly-does-some-neurodiversity.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/10/everyone-wants-cure-for-autism.html", "title": "\nEveryone wants a cure for autism?\n"},
{"date": " November 30, 2009", "body": "\nI see that Stephanie Lynn Keil of the grand illusion blog has written a new post about how she disagrees with neurodiversity and believes that a cure for autism would be a good thing.  I applaud Stephanie for doing this because as we find a growing number of persons on the spectrum who say they desire a cure we are disputing the neurodiversity contention espoused by Mike Carley, Dawn Prince-Hughes, Harry Williams (Socrates), Alex Plank and  others that \"most autistics don't want to be cured\".  Stephanie also shows great courage in signing (what I am pretty certain at least) her real name to a post stating that she wishes there could be a cure for autism.  From my own personal experience (and I suspect Stephanie can attest to this also) anyone on the spectrum who is both high functioning and courageous enough to refute the ND line is vilified, bullied and harassed.  Neurodiversity also has a \"psychologist\" (masters degree level) David Andrews who will start swearing at anyone who refutes the ND line in a blog comment.  He delights in calling them \"shite\" or \"tosspot\" or any of the other vulgar names he can think of.  It is quite frightening to me that this individual is allowed to work with autistic persons in any sort of clinical setup. Neurodiversity not only operates by abusive name-calling but by disingenuous spin as well.  It is understandable that any pro-cure autistic might be frightened of incurring the wrath of these vicious hatemongers and would not dare publicly state on the internet that they wish to be cured of this condition.  One other problem is that many of persons afflicted are too impaired to blog and refute neurodiversity's nonsense.  For example, Jon Shestack, father of Dov Shestack states that his son wants to be cured.  However, Dov is nonverbal and probably incapable of refuting NDs nonsense or participating in their skewed polls.  The same is true of John Belmonte, brother of autism brain researcher Matthew Belmonte.  John B. in his 40s, has never spoken, but he has a limited ability to communicate using either FC or some sort of augmented communication or both.  He has stated to his brother that he wishes to be cured of his autism. What of the ND pollsters who state that their \"scientific polls\" prove that most autistics don't want to be cured.  That autism speaks and other procure organizations wish to force a cure on those who don't want one (let alone the phony arguments about eugenic abortions)? I could have gone to Wasilla, Alaska and taken a poll there on who the American people wished to be president of the United States in the 2008 election.  I could have additionally gone to Biloxi, Mississippi and gotten additional poll numbers.  It is likely that at least 99% of the poll participants would have stated they supported the McCain-Palin ticket (which lost).  My poll would have been as scientific as neurodiversity's poll on whether or not autistics desire a cure.Thank you, Stephanie, for publicly stating your convictions and not allowing ND to get away with their disingenuous spin.  However, be prepared for a barrage of insults including the term \"house autistic\".

{"date": " November 4, 2009", "body": "\nI see that Joseph of the autism natural variation blog has decided based on one published report based on the statuses of only 19 people that adults with autism don't have problems with employment nor with marriage.Whatever comments you want to make on the merits or lack of merits in the recent NHS report on autistic adults, the fact of the matter was it was only based on 19 people, count 'em 19. The authors of the reports extrapolated this number 19 to the greater population claiming that 1% of adults in the UK in private households have autism. However this was just a guess based on mathematical projections.I will concede I don't know as much about math and statistics as Joseph (having just had one elementary statistics course in a community college more than 30 years ago). However, I find it hard to believe that 19 persons even comes close to a statistically significant number on which to predicate employment and marriage trends in a country of millions of adults where supposedly 1% of them have autism.In the past Joseph presented some statistic saying that 25% of autistics were employed. As far as I can tell he neglects to mention any source or reference or link for this statistic in any post on his blog. He then goes on to trot out the argument because at one time 70% of autistics were thought to have intellectual retardation and now according to some CDDS data which I don't fully understand because now 70% of the clients in the CDDS with autism are nonretarded, this translates into a 70% employment rate among autistics at some point in time. Never mind that Joseph does not adjust for changing age of entry of autistics into the CDDS with children coming into the system in much greater numbers at age 3 than in the past, making their intelligence more difficult to assess, which would confound the 70% rate of nonretardation, making Joseph's statistic here questionable.In one statement Joseph goes even further:In any case, it would seem that adult autistics who live in private households across the UK are largely productive individuals who contribute to the economy in a manner similar to their non-autistic peers.So Joseph seems to imply that autistic persons are making just as much money as an NT. While engaging in quantitative numbers of employment based on only 19 cases out of at least hundreds of thousands, he neglects to take qualitative matters into consideration, such as the fact the NT is much more likely to be a doctor or lawyer rather than a ditchdigger and vice-versa and dwarfing the employed autist's income. He neglects to take into account job coaches which cost money. Nor the possibility the autistic person is more likely to be a part-time rather than full-time employee than the NT.So again, we have ND trivialization of an autistics inability to get married or make a living.I see that one of my favorite hatemongers, the autistic bitch from hell is at it again . Now she is giving Joseph's employment pronouncements a shout-out with no critical thinking. She is also complaining about the fact that a Danish software company has helped some persons on the spectrum get jobs, claiming that this is segregation in the workplace. She compares alleged segregation in the workplace with the mandatory segregation of blacks and whites in the public school systems at one time. I should not even have to comment on why this is a patently absurd comparison, but here goes anyways. There are no laws segregating autistics and nonautistics in the workplace. This company is just helping out people who need jobs who might have trouble getting them otherwise, not necessarily because they are bad employees but due to some prejudice perhaps. This is not the same as a law saying that autists cannot work alongside typical people. There is no such law and the ABFH knows this.What is more bizarre is the fact she would complain about segregation of autistics in the workplace, yet she supports segregation in the schools of autistic children from their nonhandicapped peers. She has donated money to ASAN and has supported this organization. This is in spite of the fact that Ari Ne'eman and his ASAN cronies have been supporters of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and have lobbied congress to mandate full federal funding of this law. Thanks to this law, many parents of autistic children have been able to get the tuition at taxpayer expense to send their kids to segregated special ed schools, so typical children won't have to be offended or disgusted by having autistic children included in classrooms with them. I was in schools like this for 8 years of my life. I suspect that ABFH never spent a day of her life in a special ed setting, which is probably the case for the majority of ND's. Why she would complain about fabricated segregation in the workplace but donate money to an organization that supports a law that helps segregate autistic children from their nonhandicapped peers makes no sense to me. However, nothing ABFH does or says makes sense to me. What can you expect from a woman who says that autistics who don't agree with her should be put to death and turned into cat food.Well that is some ND Potpourri, stay tuned for some more, I am sure there will be some.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/10/unemployment-among-adult-autistics-in.html", "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/11/marriage-among-autistics-or-why-nhs.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2009/10/segregated-workplaces.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2006/02/autistic-uncle-toms.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/11/some-neurodiversity-potpourri.html", "title": "\nSome neurodiversity Potpourri\n"},
{"date": " December 23, 2009", "body": "\nI see the left brain right brain no brain blog is at it again with attempts at damage control when autism's gadfly exposed Ari Ne'eman for being appointed to the national council on disabilities when he has stated in the past that he does not believe that autism is a disability. In the original essay from which I quoted Ne'eman stated the words \"difference is not disability\". I won't bother linking to the essay because it has now been changed and I have linked to it and quoted the essay as it originally stood in my previous post and the interested reader can see these. In the changed essay Ne'eman wrote that difference is only disability when it is not accommodated for.  Sullivan quoted this changed statement and neglected to acknowledge that the essay was later edited.  He did not bother to quote the original essay.  Even with the changed essay I disagree with Sullivan's statements that this is different from saying that autism is not a disability.  Even in the changed essay Ne'eman is still implying this, though giving himself some leeway.   Though Ne'eman's changed statement really does not change the fact that he is still stating that autism is not a disability, at least given the standard definition of disability, Sullivan is trying to claim that those of us who are unhappy about Ne'eman's appointment to the council are misquoting what he said. I suppose I should have taken a screen shot of Ne'eman's original essay to show that Sullivan and other Ne'eman supporters are really being dishonest in stating that Ne'eman never stated that autism was not a disability.The origin of Ne'eman editing the essay where he originally wrote difference is not disability probably goes back to another pathetic attempt at damage control on Sullivan's part where Sullivan made tons of factual errors and neglected to do the necessary research that Ne'eman in fact had said that autism is not a disability. It was autism's gadfly who did the research showing Ne'eman in the past had written in an essay the words \"difference is not disability\" and had in fact stated that autism is not a disability. Ne'eman then stated:As for the comment made about my Jewish Week article, I don\u2019t recall saying at any point there that autism wasn\u2019t a disability \u2013 only that it was not a disease, something I think exemplifies the neurodiversity position much better. I did seem to imply it though with the phrase \u201cdifference is not disability\u201d. Though the phrase is technically true, I shouldn\u2019t have phrased it that way. I was wrong to do so \u2013 and if that is the worst mistake I\u2019ve made or ever will make in print, I\u2019ll count myself lucky. Fortunately, I have years of advocacy work and public statements that show my work in the Disability Rights movement as a person with a disability.So at the very least Ne'eman does admit to having made an error in the original article. He then went back and edited the original article to give himself some wiggle room.Having quoted the pertinent phrases of the article as it originally stood as I have done in my previous post where I talked about my take on Ne'eman's nomination to the council, I stand by my statement that the context in which \"difference isn't disability\" Ne'eman was stating unequivocally that he (at least at the time) did not believe that autism is a disability. His statement that he never said autism was not a disability certainly is not true and there is no doubt of this. Sullivan and the other ND's can put all the spin on it they want but I don't believe there is any other way that Ne'eman's comments can be construed. It is irrelevant that he has lent his time and efforts to legislation and organizations that have used the term 'disability'.The only thing that Sullivan does get right in this piece is that the efforts on my part and others who don't want Ne'eman appointed to the council will most likely be futile. Nominations to the NDC are most likely routinely confirmed as they would not generate enough controversy or have enough people complain. These are probably not like nominations to the supreme court where a controversial candidate gets scrutiny and enough people would complain to their senators and they would be blackballed in the case of Robert Bjork and nearly blackballed in the case of Clarence Thomas.If a nomination to the NDC were in the same league as a nomination to the supreme court, I can't help thinking of the grilling that Ne'eman would be getting in a subcommittee of the senate about his previous statements.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3910"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/12/sullivan-gets-it-wrong-on-ari-neeman.html", "title": "\nSullivan gets it wrong on Ari Ne'eman again\n"},

So, now we have someone who has stated the position that certain people think autism speaks is morally complicit with murder and seems to have given this statement credibility. We also have the appointment of a 21-year-old who has never been employed in any capacity who gives input on employment. Most stupefying of all is that Ne'eman is being appointed to a council on disabilities even though he himself does not believe that autism is a disability. Ne'eman has written:We see the world in a different way than our neurotypical peers (neurotypical is a word in the autistic community meaning those of the majority neurology). This does not imply a defect, but merely a difference \u2014 one that we have just the same right to as those of a different race, nationality or religion.The belief was that anyone society labeled \"disabled\" could only go so far. Sadly, these misconceptions had the potential to become self-fulfilling prophecies. When the expectation is that people of a certain type can only reach so far, they are not provided with the same challenges and opportunities that educators give mainstreamed students....In the last paragraph Ne'eman writes:We should recognize what diversity of neurology has contributed to the human race and what it can bring to the future. Difference is not disability and someday, I hope, the world will recognize that those who think in different ways should be welcomed.Of course if anyone wants to argue semantics, Ne'eman does say in that essay that disability comes from society's attitudes, so in essence he could be claiming the old Larry Arnold argument that he considers himself disabled from the social model rather than the medical model. However, still this shows to me that he has a different definition of disability than the mainstream, including what I suspect is the federal government's.This appointment of an inexperienced 21-year-old who has these views that I regard as harmful is of concern to me. I am not sure if these nominations have to be confirmed by congress or not. I would consider writing my congressman though he never responded to my question of the legality of allowing Ne'eman and Katie Miller to testify before the IACC so seems pointless to write him again. I may write a letter to President Obama telling him how much this appointment concerns me.Addendum: I decided to call my congressman's office. I was told that these appointments are confirmed by the senate and not by the house. I have written (by email) both senators Boxer and Feinstein, urging them to reject Ne'eman's confirmation to the council. I also left a phone message with Boxer's office. I got a message from Feinstein's office saying the lines were busy, but I guess the email may be enough. Of course, these appointments are probably routinely confirmed in most cases, so there is little chance enough people would complain and we could get the senate to reject Ne'eman's confirmation. But I urge anyone who feels as I do who is an American citizen to contact their senators and urge them not to confirm Ne'eman's appointment.I have also contacted the white house and left a message for president Obama that I disapproved of this nomination and felt he should reconsider.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts-121609", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=2"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/12/obama-appoints-ari-neeman-to-national.html", "title": "\nObama appoints Ari Ne'eman to National Council on disabilities\n"},
{"date": " February 10, 2010", "body": "\nNow that I have recently once again come out of retirement from being a research subject in autism studies because of my involvement with Dan Kennedy in Ralph Adolphs' lab at Cal tech, I thought I would discuss a somewhat dated op-ed piece written by famed neurodiversity idealogue Morton Gernsbacher.This was written in April of 2007 when Michelle Dawson's journal article (of which Gernsbacher was one of the secondary authors) comparing autistic individuals scores on the Wechsler IQ test versus Raven's matrices was published. Though Michelle Dawson's highest formal education is a high school diploma, she works with Gernsbacher and Laurent Mottron as an autism researcher. What makes Michelle unique is that she herself has autism and does research in autism. Gernsbacher in this editorial gives a shout-out for the need for more autism researchers with autism and seems to imply that the dearth of autistic autism researchers is not due to an autistic person's impaired ability to get a doctorate and become a scientist but rather because of societal constraints put on those with autism.This hits home with me as I had the goal of becoming a physiological psychologist or neuroscientist or possibly a neuropsychologist at the time I was a college undergraduate in the 1970s. My lack of fine motor skills which precluded me from doing stereotactic surgery on animals, my mediocre grade point average (which neurodiversity hatemonger David Andrews relishes mocking me over) prevented me from obtaining this goal. It was a huge disappointment in my life that I could not be a brain researcher and find a cure for myself (my ambition at the time albeit admittedly an unrealistic one), my impairments were what prevented me from attaining this goal, not societal constraints.I agree with some of Gernsbacher's sentiments that it would indeed be nice if there were autistic autism researchers. Of course I would hope that they would do research with the intent of finding the etiology of autistic impairments rather than having a neurodiversity ideology. However, there are numerous flaws in her arguments.She extols the aptitudes of numerous autistic individuals stating why she feels they might be good candidates as autism researchers. I agree with her characterization of Michelle Dawson as a polished writer and a scrupulous thinker. I have no reason to doubt Michelle Dawson's autism. However, she mentions Amanda Baggs, who as many people know has a questionable diagnosis. She lauds Amanda Bagg's writing style, her voracious reading and analytical skills. Yet one wonders how someone who goes out of their way to post youtube videos showing that she is so impaired that she can't even boil water could possibly be an autism researcher.She also cites Joseph of the natural variation blog as an autistic critical thinker. Yet Joseph has admitted in the past that he has never had a formal autism assessment and diagnosis, but only that his son's psychiatrist stated that there was a good chance that he had some sort of autism spectrum disorder.Michelle Dawson has often emphasized the importance of accurate information and has given yours truly scathing criticism for information that she deemed inaccurate. Yet she collaborates with Morton Gernsbacher who is claiming in the above-linked op ed piece that Vernon Smith and Richard Borcherds have autism spectrum disorders and have been officially diagnosed. This is one of the many standard neurodiversity lies and is at the cutting edge of inaccurate information that ND's such as Gernsbacher give.Vernon Smith only took a self-assessed AQ test and at age 78 announced to the media that he was autistic. He has admitted in his autobiography to never having been diagnosed by a clinician.Richard Borcherds at age 38 sought a diagnosis from autism psychologist Simon Baron Cohen who would not give him one. Borcherds is married and an award winning mathematician. In Baron Cohen's book \"The Essential difference\" Borcherds putative autism diagnosis is discussed:One might question whether Richard Borcherds really merits a diagnosis at all, given how well adapted he is. Certainly he is not currently severe enough in his symptoms to warrant a diagnosis in adulthood, as his symptoms are not interfering with his daily functioning. In the jargon of the diagnostic criteria, he is not \"suffering any impairment in his daily life\"........Gernsbacher goes on to compare autistics to blind and deaf people who do research on themselves. Yet blindness and deafness do not entail the same cognitive impairments and behavioral issues that an autistic person may have which would preclude them from going to graduate school and becoming a scientist or researcher. Even more offensive (at least to this writer) Gernsbacher compares the fact that gay people do research on issues in homosexuality and for this reason becries the dearth of autism researchers. There is a contentious debate on whether or not homosexuality is normal or abnormal or is pathological or just another sex preference that should not regarded as pathological. Most persons would not consider homosexuality in and of itself a disability. Unlike a person with autism, there is no reason a gay person, could not function in society, go to graduate school, become a scientist and a researcher on gay issues just because they have a different sexual preference from a heterosexual. No reasonable person would say the same thing for persons (some who can't even speak) have uncontrollable self-stimulatory behaviors and certainly can't function in society due to an intrinsic disability. Or perhaps this is a tacit admission on Gernsbacher's part that she does not consider autism a disability-something numerous persons involved in the ND movement insist they never do and that they do in fact believe that autism is a disability. If the latter case scenario is true then one has to wonder whether or not they in fact consider homosexuality a disability.What is interesting is that one putative autism researcher that Gernsbacher neglects to mention in order to bolster her case is Teresa Binstock a woman with Asperger's syndrome who has participated in research studies of biomed persons, persons who insist that there is a true rise in the prevalence of autism as well as the idea that mercury or some other environmental insult is responsible for a huge autism epidemic and that genetic factors are less important or nonexistent. This idea is anathema to most in the ND movement. So one wonders why Gernsbacher fails to mention Binstock.In fact Generation Rescue (an organization which most in the ND movement have expressed extreme contempt towards) gives this glowing description of Binstock:In 1997, after a 50+ years of symptoms, Teresa was diagnosed as having Asperger's Syndrome (1). Her intense focus, perserveration, and hyperlexicality have augmented her research.Sound familiar? Rather ironic if I do say so myself. Given the fact that Gernsbacher has written a piece along with her husband, Hill Goldsmith and Michelle Dawson denying that there has been an epidemic of autism and stating the term \"epidemic\" is offensive I wonder if Gernsbacher would be happy with someone on the spectrum such as Ms. Binstock who does research trying to disprove her notion.Gernsbacher shouts out some program that NIH has that encourages students with disabilities to pursue graduate studies and become doctoral level researchers and claims that autistics can take advantage of that. Well, Dr. Gernsbacher, I certainly tried my best, I was not able to cut it because of my disability. I would love to be a brain researcher and find the etiology of the defects (not differences) that cause autism. I would love to be able to find a way to cure it. My disability prevented me from doing that. I am not sure what Binstock's formal education is, but other than this example Gernsbacher neglects to mention a single doctoral level autism researcher (this excludes Michelle Dawson who does not even have an undergraduate college degree) and to the best of my knowledge there are no persons with autism who have Ph.D. degrees who are professional autism researchers, not one. I doubt very much any actually exist. If anyone can cite an example of a Ph.D. psychologist, neuroscientist or other person with autism who does autism research in the comments section of this blog I will certainly stand corrected. (Temple Grandin whose doctorate is in animal science and is not an actual autism researcher does not count). Perhaps the reason there are no autism researchers, Dr. Gernsbacher is that they don't exist and it is impossible for them to exist (at least in any extensive numbers barring a rare occurrence) without the cure you would deny autistic people, only offering acceptance as an alternative.I believe Gernsbacher should be greatful that there are autistics who offer their services merely as research subjects even if they can't be researchers. The high functioning people who serve as the research subjects do her and other scientists a great service. Their journal articles, their grants and in fact their very livelihood itself would not exist without us. She should take this into consideration.More importantly in addition to trivializing my failed dreams, Gernsbacher who has claimed that severely autistic people have made great contributions to science yet neglects to document one example, makes a mockery of the extreme hardships that persons on the lower end of the spectrum and their families go through. Not only can these persons not be researchers, they can't even be research subjects in most studies. This is because they would not be cooperative in eye tracking studies or sit still in an MRI scanner long enough for an accurate reading to be obtained or cooperative in a mu wave suppression study involving neurofeedback or some other autism treatment. Instead of complaining about autistics not being able to be researchers Dr. Gernsbacher should be complaining of the infeasibility of being able to assess lower end autistics and perhaps coming up with some sort of methodology to rectify this problem.Most interesting of all is the following statement from Gernsbacher in her piece in refuting the argument that autistics might not be objective as researchers:Or perhaps it\u2019s believed that by including autistics as research collaborators, objectivity would be foiled. As I hope my previous APS Presidential columns have illustrated, a lot of research on autistics (and research on other groups) is far from objective. As Graham Richards, former historian of the British Psychology Society, has stated, the \u201cgeneral consensus that the scientist detached from the rest of humanity in some realm of pure objectivity has ceased to be a professional ideal, and it was always in any case an unreasonable one.\u201dIf this preceding statement is true, then is Gernsbacher herself free of influence of neurodiversity bias in her own research as well as that of her frequent collaborators Laurent Mottron and Michelle Dawson (who has stated that science isn't politics)? Will Gernsbacher admit that her possible lack of objectivity as well as Mottron's might be influencing the interpretations of their research results that autism is some sort of gift that should not be cured or even looked upon as a defect?In addition to considering how she is trivializing one autistic's failed dreams perhaps Dr. Gernsbacher can engage in some self-reflection on her own statements about objectivity in research.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2147", "http://www.generationrescue.org/binstock/binstock-bio.htm"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/02/morton-gernsbacher-trivialized-my.html", "title": "\nMorton Gernsbacher trivialized my dreams\n"},
{"date": " January 2, 2010", "body": "\nI have received an interesting email from Alex Plank, the owner of the infamous neurodiversity website, wrong planet. As I am pretty sure it was a form email, I think I can print the contents without it being considered any sort of breach of ethics.Happy 2010 to my fellow Aspergians and friends! You guessed right, it's Alex, your favorite autistic website admin sending you greetings again. I think 2010 is going to be an exciting year in autism which is why I'm sending out another newsletter (even though I usually only send one every 6 months).First of all, if you haven't seen my autism documentary, please check it out ( http://wrongplanet.net/postt114120.html ). It's been quite the hit but I don't think all of you have gotten a chance to watch it and if you have watched it, please share it with as many people as you can!In addition, the site has started to load more slowly due to a recent increase in WP's popularity. If you have any extra cash, consider donating to help pay for WP's new server (one year it'll cost $4800 to run just one really fast web server and from where things are going, it looks like we'll soon need to add another server.). Every bit counts (people have donated everything from $5 to $500 so far.)I'd also like to be able to continue to produce videos like autism reality which aren't free (well they're free for you, but not for me. . . lol!) Keep in mind that WP is not tax-exempt and I only added the option to donate after I was continually asked by members of the site.In addition, if you're on twitter, follow the Wrong Planet twitter alien: http://twitter.com/wrongplanetand if you get a chance, follow me as well: http://twitter.com/alexplankAlso, I respond to your emails. Please let me know what you plan on doing for autism in 2010!!!!!!!So it is interesting that this person who banned me from his website just because I happened to post an opinion that was not in agreement with the usual ND rhetoric and was too cowardly to refute any of my positions would have the temerity to ask me to donate money to his cause.Also, Plank has stated that most autistics don't want to be cured. It is very interesting that he would consult someone whom he has banned from his website for a solicited donation yet did not bother to consult me, Stephanie Keil, Roger Kulp, Jake Crosby or other numerous autistics who do want to be cured before making this bold statement to the media.One reason not to donate money to Plank's cause is that he engages in very slipshod journalism on his webpage, claiming that autism speaks forced Zazzle to discontinue Zach Lassiter's line of t-shirts. Without investigating any of the facts, Plank ran this boldfaced lie on the front page of his website. For a while, this was a cause celebre' of neurodiversity. It was autism's gadfly who exposed this neurodiversity propaganda as being untrue. It would seem Mr. Plank has not learned his lesson and shows how ludicrous Plank is for asking someone who exposed his shoddy journalism for a donation.It is also interesting that Plank would have the gall to ask people to donate money to him so he can make more videos like his self-promoting autism reality video. Somehow because it cost him money to make this he seems to think that those who viewed it on you tube or elsewhere should pick up the tab.He also dates Katie Miller who testified before the IACC trying to convince the federal government not to fund autism research that would lead to a cure or preventing a child from becoming crippled and sick from autism.  This is in spite of the fact that the IACC grew out of the combating autism act which Miller, Plank and other ND's vigorously opposed while it was being debated in congress, so it would seem Ms. Miller wastes the taxpayer's money by proposing autism policy which is exactly opposite of the purpose for which a law was created.  Though these are all good reasons not to donate money to Plank not only from someone banned from his website, but from any person at all, it would be charitable to this young man to say these are the main reasons.Plank does not give a rat's ass about autistic persons having human rights, the oft stated goal that neurodiversitites falsely claim to have.  He does not care about helping anyone but himself.  His agenda is entirely self-service, self-promotion, so he can continue his propaganda to help himself make money and get publicity.  This is the main reason I urge anyone not to donate money to Plank. Alex, if you happen to read this I accepted your invitation to email you with my plans for autism in 2010, as I stated in my email to you, I have started out autism 2010 by writing this blog post.  You said you respond to emails.  I await your response with baited breath.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/features_julieshealthclub/2008/04/autistics-dont.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/01/email-from-alex-plank.html", "title": "\nAn email from Alex Plank\n"},
{"date": " February 18, 2010", "body": "\nThat 21st century Bruno Bettelheim, Clay Adams, who claims that autistic persons who don't like their autism and wish to be cured do so, because they were influenced by domineering mothers is at it again. Apparently not being able to think of anything original to write about me let alone any actual arguments against any of my criticisms of neurodiversity and it's various proponents has taken some old satirical and mocking songs directed towards your humble blogger and reprinted them from various places he has written them before in a blog post.Adams, who claims to have obtained an autism diagnosis in his 50's was able to serve in the navy, get married and hold down jobs where he made enough money to support at least one or two children. He apparently was also able to retire at a somewhat younger age than other social security recipients from having made astute investments. Adams has claimed that the only reason I am too impaired to serve in the military or get married is because of attitudes that my mother foisted upon me it was not due to a neurologic impairment. His pal Harry Williams (AKA Socrates) has agreed to this belief in the comments section claiming none of my disabilities comes from autism.This hits home with me because unlike I suspect the vast majority of persons in the autism blogosphere, particularly members of the infamous autism hub I actually lived through the Bettelheim era, where I underwent psychoanalysis and my mother (and I guess to a lesser extent my dad) were blamed for my problems by my former therapist. I have already had to live through this era in my youth, now Mr. Adams has been attempting to get me to live through it again.Normally I would just ignore Clay Adams' slights as he clearly is out to get attention and I should not be giving him the attention he craves so much. However, some new issues have come up.In his post mocking me Mr. Adams ripped off a photo from my blog which is a violation of the DMCA federal law. we see that in the past Mr. Adams has had no qualms of ripping off other people's material and infringing on copyrights I flagged his blog and filed a DMCA complaint with google. It has been more than two days and they still have not acted upon it and have not deleted my photograph from Adams' blog. I also sent email to hub administrator Dave Seidel suggesting that if my photo were not taken down that I might file a complaint with google against him and the hub and I might also contact the hub's ISP. I only received a somewhat sarcastic reply from Mr. Seidel which I won't print here.In the past when John Best of the hating autism blog has engaged in unauthorized use of photos of Phil Gluyas and David Andrews and possibly other individuals these persons filed DMCA complaints with google and the photos were taken down in less than 24 hours.Also, I can just imagine the ire that would be directed at any equivalent autism hub that had a pro biomed chelation philosophy that hosted John Best's blog the way Seidel and the hub have endorsed and linked Clay Adams' blog. They constantly complain of Best's sometimes outrageous behavior, personal attacks and his mocking and ridiculing other persons. Yet it is fine with Seidel and the rest of the hub members that Clay Adams can write posts mocking me and ridiculing me and can infringe upon the copyright of my photo. I did point out that Seidel was only hurting himself by an association with this individual.Even more germane to this whole thing is that now the hating autism blog and it's associated blogs are dead. Google, apparently, without any explanation to Best, deleted all of his blogs. There were likely multiple complaints of John Best's angry and caustic behavior and even possibly the false allegations the ND hub members have made in the past that he threatened Ari Ne'eman with death. For the most part, as I said before, I have chosen to ignore Clay Adam's abusive statements towards my parents, his constantly writing abusive comments to me on this blog which I almost never publish. However, I believe this double standard of Google acting upon DMCA takedowns against John Best, but allowing Clay Adams to slide and use my photograph without my consent on his blog is a double standard. I have no idea why Google does not believe in fair play, why they would act against Best and not act against Adams.If the NDs think they can shut John Best up however, they are sadly mistaken. He has resurrected his blog at http://www.hatingautism.weebly.com/ for anyone interested. As I don't approve of a lot of Best's behavior and tactics and I have urged him to tone down some of his rhetoric, it is with some reluctance that I plug his new blog. However, one must remember the addage fight fire with fire. If Seidel and the rest of the hub are willing to link to a blog which takes cheap shots at someone's disability by someone whose own autism diagnosis is dubious at best, then by all means I can have no qualms about publicizing Best's new blog. It is strangely hypocritical of neurodiversity in general and the autism hub and Dave Seidel in particular to claim they are about treating persons on the spectrum with dignity and respect when they link to a blog that tries to bring back the Bettelheim era and also someone who writes satirical songs ridiculing and mocking certain aspects of someone's disability.Though I don't condone a lot of John Best's behavior and tactics it does not mean the neurodiversity movement does not generate a lot of problems for at least some of us who are on the spectrum and their families. It is sort of like saying that because Black people sometimes riot in the streets as they did in my home town of Los Angeles in 1965 and 1992 that racism is not a problem. John Best's son is severely afflicted and barring a miracle he will never be able to refute any of the ND propaganda. Neurodiversity does present problems in that they often trivialize autism by claiming Bill Gates and others have autism. They claim autism is not a tragedy so that persons like myself who are trying to obtain disability who need it will have an even harder time and they try to stifle scientific research that could some day put an end to this miserable tragedy. If ND wants to play hardball by endorsing Clay Adams blog by linking to it on the hub then I see no problem of giving the new hating autism blog a shoutout. It is in this spirit that I publicize the new hating autism blog and look forward to reading more of what John Best has to write.If anyone from google happens to read this (assuming they don't delete my blog also) perhaps they can explain to me this double standard which shows such huge bias towards neurodiversity.Addendum: Also for the time being Best's writings can be read on hatingautismtwo.blogspot.comThe latest is that for the time being Best's blogs are back up, so I guess neurodiversity has been foiled.  But I am still concerned about Google acting on DMCA takedowns on Best's blog,  but not acting against Clay Adams violations of the blogger terms of service\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://cometscorner-clay.blogspot.com/2010/02/satire-extravaganza.html", "http://cometscorner-clay.blogspot.com/2010/02/penelope-trunk-speaks.html", "http://www.hatingautism.weebly.com/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/02/googles-double-standard-re.html", "title": "\nGoogle's double standard re neurodiversity\n"},
{"date": " February 2, 2010", "body": "\nI see that president Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel has referred to people who he does not agree with as \"fucking retarded\" Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, the mother of a Down's syndrome child, naturally took umbrage to the comment and demanded that the president fire Mr. Emanuel from the administration.In general, neurodiversity has claimed to be about human rights and dignity for those on the spectrum. This includes not calling persons with developmental disabilities \"retards\" or using the term \"retarded\" in a pejorative or insulting manner as Mr. Emanuel has done. Timothy Shriver, head of the special Olympics, has also called Mr. Emanuel to task and subsequently received an apology from the foul mouthed white house chief of staff.Interestingly enough, it was Ari Ne'eman and his organization ASAN which crusaded against the movie tropic thunder because it had the word \"retard\" in it in various places.I will be interested if anyone of the autism hub bloggers will be taking this up as a subject and whether or not they will criticize Emanuel or join former governor Palin in asking for his ouster. It would seem strangely hypocritical and inconsistent if they did not. Of course, the stakes may be too high for them. After all, with Ari Ne'eman's nomination for a post in the national disability council, the neurodiversity movement has a foot in the door in recommending public policy both to the white house and congress in regards to disabilities.We have already seen evidence of two-facedness and hypocrisy from club ND. Laurent Mottron has accepted a half million dollar grant from an organization whose goal he states is nonsensical and one he clearly does not agree with or like. His factotum, Michelle Dawson, who has stated in the past that the organization that helps in part to pay for her research ideally wishes a short future for persons with autism and has stated the people who raise funds for this organization, \"make her sick\" justified her refusal to resign from the Mottron group in protest with the statement, \"science isn't politics\".We have seen evidence of Mr. Ne'eman's hypocrisy elsewhere.We now have to wonder whether Ari will ask that his name be withdrawn from consideration for an appointment to the national disabilities council.  Will he be urged by his fellow ASAN members and neurodiversitites to do the honorable thing and ask the Obama administration to withdraw his name from consideration as a member of the national disabilities council?

{"date": " January 6, 2010", "body": "\nI see that Ari Ne'eman and ASAN have yet a new crusade and that is to exonerate and free Zakhqurey Price, an 11-year-old autistic boy who was being restrained by some special educators due to some behavioral issues and in the process injured the special educators and is now facing felony charges. One of Ne'eman's and ASAN's recommendations is that the charges against the young boy be dropped. They are crusading other ND's to write letters to the principal of the school and to have legislation passed that would give protections to handicapped children such as these in future situations.Normally, autism's gadfly would be praising Ne'eman and saying perhaps this is a rare example of ASAN actually doing something good, as in the past when they have criticized the judge Rottenberg center (of course this is aside from the issue that ASAN does not do much more than give lip service opposing Matthew Israel and his ilk and spends more time protesting autism speaks than the electric shocks and other aversives that Israel and his colleagues dispense). I would agree this boy was too impaired to know what he was doing, had a disability/disorder/disease which would not make him culpable of these actions and though I don't know all the circumstances, I would probably be in favor of dropping the charges. It is likely a diminished capacity defense would be warranted under the circumstances.However, in this case, it is my opinion that attention needs to be brought to inconsistencies on Ne'eman's part (seemingly so common for him) in regards to this issue which at the very least reduces his and ASAN's credibility.Ne'eman has written an essay ,entitled 'equality demands responsibility', in which he completely digresses from the tenets that he is currently expounding upon to help protect and give rights to Zakh.Ne'eman complains of a Dr. Phil show in which a case similar to Zakh's is presented and Ne'eman feels this puts people with ASD in a bad light:Dr. Phil portrays those of our neurology as unstable, aggressive and out of control. As a community, we can probably agree that this alarmist ratings ploy is not the face we want to present to the public.Of course Ne'eman wants to make a public case out of this 11-year-old boy.Ne'eman goes on with other interesting statements in this essay, describing a character with an ASD in a television show who commits a crime and then has charges against him dropped:it arguably paints almost as insulting a picture as Dr. Phil. When Jerry\u2019s threatened colleague agrees to drop the charges against him\u2014after learning about his unfortunate \u201cdisorder\u201d and ensuring that he leaves the firm for \u201ctreatment\u201d\u2014the message sent is a simple one: his actions were simply outside of his control. This makes for good television, but does it really benefit our community as a whole if autistic identity is portrayed as a defense against assault? The resulting implication is not a positive one.Ne'eman goes on to make other baffling statements in light of his new position about this 11-year- old boy's situation:Yes, we are autistics living in a neurotypical society. Undoubtedly, that brings about certain pressures and problems. But if we are to demand equal legitimacy, if we are to assert that a \u201ccure\u201d is not only unnecessary and undesirable but also morally reprehensible,(emphasis added) then we must accept for ourselves equal responsibilities. Accommodation within the law can be sought when reasonable, exemption from the law cannot be.Ne'eman then goes on with a homily about how terrible it is that there is a trend among persons with Asperger's syndrome to use this as a defense when charged with crimes. So apparently it would seem he is opposed to a diminished capacity defense for criminal behavior under any circumstance for persons on the spectrum.He claims that curing this 11-year-old boy of this neurological condition that caused him to be charged with felonies is not only unnecessary but is morally reprehensible.One wonders why Ne'eman is not more consistent in his thinking. Based on the essay he wrote about equal responsibility, one would think that Ne'eman would be helping to prosecute the young man accused rather than saying that the charges should be dropped. Ne'eman would be recommending juvenile hall or institutionalization for this boy. After all, this young man should be living up to his responsibilities if he wants to be treated as an equal. A cure for his condition would destroy who he is, it would be totally undesirable, so instead one would think Ne'eman would want him prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and have the book thrown at him.Instead Ne'eman not only recommends dropping the charges but he is recommending accommodations under the IDEA and behavioral support which constitutes \"treatment\" for this \"disorder\" which Ne'eman put in quotes in the example from the television show.Well, I continued to be baffled by the logic of neurodiversitites.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=103", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/71/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/01/zakhqurey-pricemore-inconsistencies.html", "title": "\nZakhqurey Price:More inconsistencies from Ari Ne'eman?\n"},
{"date": " February 12, 2010", "body": "\nI have recently read an interesting post on the autism jabberwocky blog about neurodiversitite Michael John Carley. Roger Kulp of the new \"smash the spectrum\" blog mentions Carley in his post also. It would seem that Mr. Carley, an individual who was able to get married, have two children, support a family and was not diagnosed with an ASD until age 36 and only after one of his sons was diagnosed with an ASD feels that the new changes in the DSM which would eliminate Asperger's and make all ASD's part of a group just called autism are in his words \"hard to swallow\".Carley has stated in his book Asperger's from the inside out that there is a universal feeling among persons on the autism spectrum that they don't want to be cured.  He seems to want to speak for me in spite of being Asperger's which means he likely never had a speech delay as I had or spent several years in special education as I did.  Naturally Carley has no basis for this blanket statement other than various things he has read on wrongplanet or other ND websites.  So he spreads the same baloney that Alex Plank spreads. Carley takes pride in his Asperger's diagnosis because he states that Einstein and Jefferson had Asperger's syndrome. As at least some readers of the gadfly blog know I have written an essay which refutes this notion by Carley and other NDs.Carley apparently does not like the idea of being called autistic because it means he would be classified along with persons who head bang or who are adults in diapers rather than being able to fancy himself another Albert Einstein or Thomas Jefferson.MJ, author of the autism jabberwocky blog, who, if I am not mistaken, has two twin daughters who are both on the more severe end of the spectrum (I guess if MJ reads this he can correct me if I am wrong), naturally took umbrage at this comment. Carley's beliefs seem to be rather condescending if not somewhat bigoted. MJ pointed out that it would seem strange that this man who at one time made a living as a diplomat working with the United Nations would in fact be so undiplomatic and I agree with his assessment.Roger Kulp, in the above linked post, pointed out some MRI studies that suggest that on a neurophysiologic level that autism and Asperger's may be more dissimilar disorders than people at first thought. So there may be something to the autism is not Asperger's mantra.One wonders if other ND's share Carley's sentiments. They claim to be about dignity and human rights. They claim that autism speaks and the autism genetic resource exchange largely exist to deliberately come up with a prenatal test that would enable autistic fetuses to be aborted. Yet Carley does not seem to care about anyone but Shiny Aspies besides himself.One can only hope that the new changes in the DSM will mean that most neurodiversitites who state they are on the spectrum who have asperger's rather than autism will no longer be able to call themselves autistic and say they are people like me, who had a speech delay as a small child and was probably pretty severely autistic and went to special schools for 8 years etc. I can also hope that perhaps the new DSM might mean the end of the neurodiversity movement. I wrote about this idea in a previous gadfly post but I reckon it is really too much to wish for.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/02/rant-michael-john-carley-finds-autism.html", "http://smashthespectrum.blogspot.com/2010/02/apa-does-it-again-new-dsm-pleases.html", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/undiagnosing.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/02/michael-john-carley-disses-nonaspergers.html", "title": "\nMichael John Carley disses nonAsperger's lower functioning autistics\n"},
{"date": " February 20, 2010", "body": "\nAs is par for the course for him/her, left brain, right brain blogger Sullivan is writing about special education and gets his/her facts wrong again I have also written about Sullivan's errors and misconstruing the facts on whether or not Ari Ne'eman has said that autism is a disability. Also, he was one of the persons who fabricated the neurodiversity lie that John Best had actually threatened Ari Ne'eman with death. Also his post where he tried to refute Age of autism blogger Jake Crosby and got nearly all of his \"facts\" wrong. I won't bother to link to these gadfly posts but I am sure the interested reader will be able to find them.Sullivan starts out by complaining about the Obama administrations promise to provide 40% federal funding of special education spending not being fulfilled.  As Sullivan chooses to remain anonymous I don't know whether this person is an American citizen. Assuming they are, they have an appalling ignorance of the most rudimentary knowledge of how our government works. The president does not unilaterally have the power to spend money or to authorize the spending of money, this is done by the U.S. Congress and the Senate. They are the ones who generate the pursestrings.Sullivan subsequently states that:The IDEA made a commitment that the U.S. Federal Government would pay 40% of the costs of special education. In reality, the government typically pays about 17%.This shows how little Sullivan actually understands about the law. There was never a commitment or promise to fully fund IDEA. The law states the federal government would pay a maximum of 40%. Anyone with the least rudimentary math skills will realize that a maximum of 40% funding can equal zero. In other words the federal government is under no legal obligation whatsoever to spend a dime on special education. At the time the education for all handicapped act was passed in 1975 which later was reauthorized to become the individuals with disabilities education act was passed it was only civil rights legislation and was never intended to be a funded mandate.From Wikipedia: When originally passed in 1975, congress established a maximum funding level for the program of 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure of American students. This was a rough proxy for the estimated additional cost of educating a student with disabilities. Some have construed this as promise that the federal government would fund that amount spending. Sullivan is among the persons who have either misconstrued or deliberately lied about the law. In all fairness to Sullivan, this is something that is not unique to him/her, but something that has been done by multitude of persons who promote this law and are oftentimes financial beneficiaries of it, such as teachers, attorneys and ABA therapists. When the IDEA was passed there was no intention to make it anything other than civil rights legislation and not a federally funded mandate. For those who want to split hairs, it is true the law was reauthorized in 2004 to give congress some leeway to obtain the 40% mark, but there was no actual promise or commitment. The website which I have linked to above puts it well: Although the new law stops short of guaranteeing that the federal government will pay 40 percent of the costs of special education, it authorizes significant additional spending that, if appropriated, will bring the federal contribution to special education to the 40 percent mark by 2011. Congress opted to address the funding issue through this \u201cglide path\u201d rather than making special education funding an entitlement or mandatory.So we see in reality that the 40% commitment promise is merely a myth.There is no evidence at all that high special education spending is helpful to those on the spectrum or ever will be. Particularly salient in this regard is the funding by school districts of Lovaas style ABA in spite of the questionable science behind the study as well as Lovaas' neglect to publish adult outcomes of his subjects in spite of receiving significant federal funding to do so. Sometimes the costs of special education are exorbitant and involve residential schools at costs annually per student in the six figures. Not to mention the costs in attorney's fees to both parties and the aggravation that parents and school districts go through as well as this law encouraging adversarial relationships between parents of disabled children and school districts.In a previous gadfly post I wrote about approximately one half of special ed students failing the high school exit exam in California as opposed to a more than 90% pass rate among their nonhandicapped peers.Sullivan is typical of neurodiversity proponents in that he wishes to maintain the status quo in terms of progress for those with developmental disabilities as have Ari Ne'eman and ASAN. They both want to increase funding for a law that has been an abysmal failure rather than encouraging scientific research to come up with better treatments or possibly a cure for autism.Also in the future when writing blog posts I suggest Sullivan does their homework first.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/02/obamas-disappointing-education-budget/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuals_with_Disabilities_Education_Act", "http://74.125.155.132/search?q=cache:AC18VERLRT0J:www.ncwd-youth.info/assets/info_briefs/infobrief_issue10.doc+federal+funding+special+education+40%25+maximum&cd=23&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&ie=UTF-8"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/02/special-education-sullivan-gets-it.html", "title": "\nspecial education: Sullivan gets it wrong again\n"},
{"date": " February 20, 2010", "body": "\nI see a blogger named Astrid has put an absolutely phony baloney spin on what ND represents. She states:Neurodiversity\u201d has never been a unified movement. It is an ideology of acceptance and respect for human and civil rights regardless of neurotype. Neurodiversity as an ideology has nothing to do with how well someone can live a \u201cproductive\u201d life by neurotypical standards if provided with certain accommodations.I will state that I agree with the first sentence. Neurodiversity involves different individuals with different takes on a variety of fronts and there is no general consensus, though there are many similar ideas involved. Though as one of my readers, Marius Filip, who lived in Romania (a communist nation at one time) aptly put it, communists are not united either. A Maoist is not a Stalinist or a Trotsky, etc. Though ND's consistently hide behind the smokescreen of civil and human rights, there is no evidence for this. ASAN only campaigns against perceived slights against autistics, such as the ransom notes campaign or derogatory use of the R word in movies in spite of Rahm Emanuel's use of this word and Ari Ne'eman's lack of response, most likely due to his anxiousness to grab that post in Obama's administration that he is up for appointment for. They care not about the right of an autistic not to be segregated from peers as they support full funding of the IDEA which ensures that parents will send their kids to special ed schools and ABA treatments for which no evidence exists of efficacy, particularly in adult outcomes which have never been reported in the literature. In fact the campaign to turn autism from a medical disease into a civil rights crusade is nothing but a smokescreen.In terms of how productive a life an individual can live by societal acceptance, Astrid ignores Larry Arnold's statement about the social model of disabilities which basically says when barriers are removed autistics can do just fine. She ignores David Andrews statements about influences society has on performance, as well as Ari Ne'eman's same statements. Not to mention the despicable \"no myths\" video when Ari said it was a myth that autism was no tragedy and there was no hope. Not to mention Ne'eman's difference does not equal disability statement which was later changed to difference only becomes disability when not accommodated for.Astrid goes on with these incredible statements:It has nothing to do with whether we are the next step in evolution, somehow superior to neurotypicals, whether autism causes us to possess strengths, or whether it is a disability. It has nothing to do with whether certain current or future treatments for autistic symptoms are necessary or desirable. It has nothing to do with forbidding any research on autism.Astrid apparently has not read the various things on the internet about the alleged autism of Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, Isaac Newton, Steven Spielberg, etc. and how their \"autism\" enhances their superiority and how this is a justification against curing autism. She has not read Frank Klein's old website where he stated that autism equaled genius and greatness in spite of the fact he himself was on the dole and apparently incapable of holding down a minimum wage job. Astrid has apparently not read the statements of Judy Singer (originator of the term neurodiversity) in which she states that Asperger's is not a disability, nor Ari Ne'eman's (current spokesman for ND movement if anyone is) about how difference is not disability. She apparently does not know about Ari Ne'eman lobbying the federal government to put a moratorium on genetic research. She has not read the autistic bitch from hell's propaganda that the only thing on autism speaks agenda is to find a prenatal test so autistic fetuses can be aborted. One wonders what cave Astrid has been holing herself up in that she has not seen all of the protests against autism speaks and all the hatred and anger that this organization receives because it funds autism research. Astrid is apparently unaware of the statement by autism researcher Kate Plaisted Grant in response to the recent study showing improved social behavior among high functioning autistics with oxytocin treatment:This recognition of difference, rather than illness or deficit, views autism as a way of thinking that allows greater understanding of certain aspects of the world than many neurotypicals are capable of, and that society benefits greatly from the contribution of these skills,\" Astrid goes on to say: In fact, if the so-called \u201cneurodiversity movement\u201d truly was what MJ and other people outside of, and even within the \u201cmovement\u201d see it as, I would not have considered myself a part of it.Then my dear Astrid, perhaps you should reconsider your position as a neurodiversitite. Perhaps you really are not a believer in neurodiversity if you don't agree with any of these positions that have been so pervasive within the ND movement. I concede I don't know what all your exact positions are on these issues, assuming you are being honest (certainly a dubious assumption where any ND proponent is concerned) then perhaps you really don't believe in neurodiversity and in actuality you should consider the company you are keeping. For it is clear to this blogger you are out of the neurodiversity mainstream if you do not agree with these positions.Similarly, if I, exercising my relatively \u201chigh-functioning\u201d autistic privilege, erase your child through the reasoning I use to base autistic acceptance on, point it out. Do not use my, or anyone else\u2019s, erasure of your child as a reason to discard the entire ideology of acceptance, or to decide that it is not for your child. The conditional nature of some pro-neurodiversity arguments may not suit your child, but this means these arguments are exclusionist, rather than that your child does not have the same rights we do.Has Astrid ever been in special ed? Is she nonverbal or incontinent or have the same sort of problems of Sam Best, Connor Doherty or Dov Shestack? How can she speak for these people? Certainly John Best, Jon Shestack and Harold Doherty are not abandoning the idea of acceptance for their child, quite the opposite. They just don't believe that someone should speak of autism from an insider's point of view when these people (including Astrid) have nothing in common with their children.As I have stated in my essay, neurodiversity just say no, most ND's (Astrid herself is a prime example of this) are very unrepresentative of autistics at large. They are predominantly high functioning women, though the ratio of high functioning autistic males to females is at least 10 to 1 as has been reported in the literature. The majority of them probably never spent a day in their life in a special ed school as I have or have had the same challenges in life that I and most other diagnosed persons on the spectrum have had. So, no, we can disregard what they say about autism if they are talking about autistics other than themselves.Astrid attempts to put up the traditional neurodiversity smokescreen and extols the bullpuckey arguments that ND's always give to their movement and she does a damn lousy job of it. She also completely disregards the hatred of individuals like Clay Adams and Phil Gluyas who like to be abusive and insult people's parents. She ignores Kowalski and Turner who have stated that parents of autistics who want to cure their children are like members of the KKK forced to raise black children. She ignores the statements of the autistic bitch from hell that autistics with whom she does not agree with should be lined up against the wall and shot or strangled to death and turned into cat food She ignores Sadder but Wiser girl's statements that autistics who wish to be cured of their condition are like Jews who aide the Nazi's during world war II and would gladly jump into the crematorium themselves.It is pathetic that ND has to stoop to such nonsense to justify themselves and does such a lousy job of it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://astridvanwoerkom.wordpress.com/2010/02/18/neurodiversity-shouldnt-be-exclusionist/", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/neurodiv.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2006/02/autistic-uncle-toms.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/02/astrids-spin-on-neurodiversity.html", "title": "\nAstrid's spin on neurodiversity\n"},
{"date": " February 23, 2010", "body": "\nIn my previous post I blogged about Ari Ne'eman's article in the latest issue of Disabilities studies quarterly and the problems with a lot of Ne'eman's contentions in his piece. This was not the only proneurodiversity article in the current issue. There have been several pro neurodiversity articles published including an article with an interesting take about the ransom notes campain a couple of years ago. For those who don't remember the New York University child study center had an ad campaign which talked about how we have your son, he has autism we will make sure he does not take care of himself or interact socially as long as he lives, etc.The neurodiversity movement, lead by Ari Ne'eman took umbrage to this and lead a successful campaign to have these advertisements expunged. I was also offended by the ransom notes but for a different reason than Ne'eman. I believe the NYU study center was engaged in deceptive advertsing claiming there was an easy release from the abyss of autism, which as regular gadfly readers know, I don't buy into. Ne'eman and his pals took offense because they felt it was making autism look bad. I in turn was offended by ASAN and other disability groups campaign because I do not believe eliminating the ransom notes advertising did anything to better the lives of persons with autism. Persons with autism in many cases still can't speak, they are most likely largely unemployed and have to be in special education schools or classes because of bad behavior. It does nothing to eliminate the hardships of autism. I do not believe bothering about the ransom notes campaign was time well spent. It made no difference in the lives of an autistic person or lead them to make friends, find employment, be able to perform tasks, etc.The article has an interesting take. First of all, it extols the social model of disability over the medical model, the belief that Ne'eman and others have is that the medical aspects of autism are not as impairing to the individual as sociological barriers or false expectations that prevent them from doing the things in life that typical persons take for granted.It starts off with an interesting quote from well-known neurodiversity blogger \"the autistic bitch from hell\" she states:From day one, the consistent message put forth by Autism Speaks has been that autistic people are tragically defective burdens on society and that a child would be better off dead than autistic. Ms. Wright describes the most notable accomplishment of Autism Speaks in these words: \"We produced a movie, Autism Every Day, and it was accepted into Sundance for a special screening... [I]n this movie a father talks about hoping that a little boy would go into the pond on his property and drown.\" (\"ABFH,\" 2007a)This complaint from ABFH about the lack of respect for the lives of autistic people is interesting in light of another post she wrote about previously to her 2007 post griping about autism speaks disregard of autistic lives.She stated on the subject of pro-cure autistics such as myself:Make no mistake about it, these slimeballs know exactly what they're doing. They're very well aware that they are still autistic and that there is no such thing as a cure. They gulp down anti-anxiety meds by the bucketful to ensure that they won't jeopardize their endorsement contract by having an inconvenient twitch or tic in public. For them, it's all about the money. They don't care how much harm they're doing to vulnerable families. They ought to be lined up against a wall and shot, but in lieu thereof, they can all kiss my autistic ass.Later in the same post ABFH states about autistics she does not agree with:This group can also be excused from kissing my bodacious booty. I wouldn't let their nasty keyboard-pecking beaks anywhere near me. About the only thing I'd do with them is wring their scrawny feathery necks and turn them into cat food.One wonders about the totally inconsistent statements ABFH makes about the value of lives of autistic people. One explaination is that she believes that the persons autism speaks refers to will grow up to be neurodiversity proponents, yet the lives of pro-cure autistics such as myself are worthless and we should be shot or strangled to death and turned into cat food. Though ABFH complains about her perception that autism speaks claims that autistic children would be better of dead than autistic, it would seem to me she is making the claim that autistics whom she does not agree with, particularly those like myself who wish a cure are better off dead than alive.The article goes on to make the analogies for the social model of disability in that we don't consider ourselves disabled because we can't run 70 miles per hour or fly but the invention of trains and airplanes helped us overcome those barriers and in the same vein the social model of disability by this specious reasoning can save the day for those with autism.In the same vein it could be argued that people should have protested persons such as the Wright Brothers who were doing research to invent airplanes or persons who invented trains they way that they protest autism speaks. After all the invention of planes and trains degrade our humanity and our beautiful running ability and our humaness that would just reduce us to the lower form of life of birds if we were able to have flight.The author of this article also invokes the \"do no harm\" part of the Hippocratic oath claiming that somehow the doctors behind the ransom notes campaign violated theirs.Of course no mention is made of Laurent Mottron who has claimed that autism is harmless, that autism is merely a difference and posthumously diagnosis Niklos Tesla with autism or at least autistic traits, therefore trivializing autism. Also, his questionable claims when applying for research grants that got him half a million dollars funding by autism speaks and additional funding by the Canadian government. Except for the fact that French doctors may not required to take this oath as are their American counterparts, neurodiversity does not seem to mind that Mottron may be violating his oath.Author Joseph Kras also objects to the fact that autistic people were not consulted when the Ransom notes campaign was instituted. He also claims that they do not provide a fair picture of their subjects which they are ethically obligated to do.Conversely could it be claimed that just consulting Ari Ne'eman and his colleagues, most of them either students in major colleges, some with advanced degrees, virtually all of the board of ASAN having Asperger's syndrome and not autism with a speech delay proper as I had are really consulting autistic people as a whole or if these people as well as other neurodiversity proponents are really representative of autistic people.Is Ari Ne'eman ethically obligated to admit that at least 99.9999% of the autistic populace, myself included, will never function at his level, be able to get a high paying job in disabilities policy making at the highest level of government at age 22, will be able to think of being a Rhoades Scholar or going to law school in a major university. Perhaps Kras and Ari Ne'eman can question their own ethics before they question Harold Koplewicz and others behind the failed ransom notes campaign.I see some real problems in this article as well as the previous article in the DQS issue by Ari Ne'eman which I blogged about earlier. I am not sure if gadfly will take the time to read the other articles and comment on those. These are the only two I have read so far, but I suspect most of these other articles are bullpucky also, I may or may not report on them. Normally I had not planned on blogging so much but this is a very interesting time in the history of neurodiversity and as I have said before: We don't need no stinkin' neurodiversity!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dsq-sds.org/article/view/1065/1254", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2006/02/autistic-uncle-toms.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/02/ransom-notes-article-in-disabilities.html", "title": "\nRansom notes article in disabilities studies quarterly\n"},
{"date": " February 23, 2010", "body": "\nI see that yet another article on the ND movement has been published in the latest issue of autism asperger's digest. Your humble blogger and Age of autism staffer Jake Crosby are given token mention as anti neurodiversity bloggers. Though the article is entitled Neurodiversity: A Balanced Opinion, author Nick Dubin's opinion is anything but balanced. He most clearly embraces neurodiversity and is opposed to a cure for autism. Interestingly enough Dr. Dubin did not find out he was on the spectrum until age 27 and then five years later obtained a doctoral degree in psychology. Most of the stuff in the article is very old news for anyone who has followed the ND movement for any length of time, but I still linked to it on here as it might make an interesting read for some persons.Of note the article mentions William Stillman, a self-diagnosed autistic with no credentials who apparently can get $100 an hour for a phone consult and when questioning how smart a person on the spectrum is Stillman states, 'presume intelligence'.More interesting is the statement about Michael John Carley.Dubin States:Carley serves as a true role model for people of all ages on the spectrum. His character and actions exude tolerance and respect and his efforts to serve as a bridge of understanding to those who are not on the spectrum are admirableThough it is probable that Dubin wrote the article before Carley made his recent controversial statements regarding his views of Asperger's being taken out of the DSM and not wanting to be associated with autistics who were head bangers or who wore diapers as adults one can laugh at the irony of this. I think some of my ND opponents will agree with me on this point.Again, old stuff for most of us, but something that might be worth a cursory read in any event.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.grasp.org/media/Neuro.ASDig.pdf"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/02/another-article-on-neurodiversity.html", "title": "\nAnother article on neurodiversity\n"},
{"date": " February 28, 2010", "body": "\nIn today's Los Angeles times there is a rather interesting op-ed piece that deals with the hardships of schizophrenia written by the sister of a schizophrenic. She talks about her brother's delusions, the fact he hears voices and threatened to kill their father and had to call the Sheriff's department on their own son to have him taken into custody.It talks about his having to live in Santa Barbara County on SSI that is less than $845/month. He is always broke and living in poverty. Their parents bought the brother a mobile home in a trailer park. Next year the trailer park is requiring all of the tenants to buy the land under their mobile homes. The sister wonders what the brother will do or where he will live.The last line of the piece states:And What will happen when the last bit of my mother's estate runs out and my sister and I have nothing left to give him when he's broke Who is responsible? Who is responsible for them all?This has got me to thinking. It has been pretty well known for years that the prevalence of schizophrenia in the general population of most countries runs about 1%. Back in the 1970s it was felt that autism was a much rarer disorder with a prevalence of about 1 in 2500. Now according to the most recent studies done by the CDC it is about 1 in 110 so very close to what schizophrenia is now.There is now a point of contention of whether or not autism is just as prevalent in all age groups or is much more prevalent among persons born in or after 1990. Most persons in the neurodiversity movement don't believe there has been a genuine increase in autism that the numbers have always been the same and it has always been a high stable rate. If this is the case, then this means there are about as many autistic adults as adults with schizophrenia and what will happen when parents are not around to help their autistic children as adults after they die is an interesting question. This is aside from the fact that since autism exists in the person from early child on unlike schizophrenia which usually does not have an age of onset until about age 19 or 20 would be more costly since services for many would be needed throughout their lives and the parents of schizophrenia would at least get a break during their offspring's childhood.If there is an equivalent neurodiversity movement for schizophrenia to the one for autism that is so salient in the blogosphere, they would certainly find this article offensive. They would not want to hear anything bad about schizophrenia or the hardships concurrent in it. They would be aghast that the sister could wallow in such self-pity as to complain in a piece published by a major metropolitan newspaper.I seem to remember one neurodiversity blogger, Mike Stanton stated that schizophrenia was not autism and the comparisons were not apt when someone tried to make that comparison to counter his neurodiversity beliefs.  Mike Stanton also engages in censorship placing me in moderation when I made a polite comment on his blog taking issue and showing inconsistencies to his neurodiversity logic.  I also found this article interesting as I had a good friend with schizophrenia for many years (one of the few friends I have had in recent years) but apparently he had a breakdown and may have stopped taking his medications and was just impossible to deal with. Our friendship is now over and it is sad indeed.Though autism and schizophrenia are different disorders they are probably at least second cousins in that the so-called negative aspects of schizophrenia-the impaired ability to relate to people and make friends, the problems with theory of mind etc.-are strikingly similar to autism in some respects. Though I can't remember the exact articles there have been structural magnetic resonance imaging scans that have found cerebellar abnormalities that are similar in schizophrenics to the ones found in autism. So I do have somewhat of an interest in schizophrenia.I can say the same thing for autistic persons to neurodiversity. Who will care? Who will be responsible for them all? Neurodiversity's response is that these problems don't exist, they find the fact that autism is viewed as a costly affliction offensive. They question a lot of the statistics in a \"don't confuse me with the facts\" response. They use Bill Gates and Stephen Spielberg and Vernon Smith as \"autistics\" who make great contributions to the economy and therefore balance out those who don't, so that in fact the costs are nothing more than a zero sum game according to neurodiversity logic.But in spite of the disingenuous spin that ND puts on this along with everything else, the question still remains as Marcia Meier put it about her schizophrenic brother: Who is responsible, who is responsible for them all?Our government finances the research of Morton Gernsbacher .  She is also allowed to review grants for research for autism speaks and peer reviews the research of other scientists for journals. She has claimed autism is not harmful. Autism speaks finances the work of Laurent Mottron who made that same claim in a piece that he coauthored with Gernsbacher and Michelle Dawson.  Our government has appointed Ari Ne'eman who claims that autism is not even a medical disability and finding a cure for autism would be morally reprehensible to the highest disability public policy position in government.It won't be easy sleeping at night knowing that these individuals are responsible for them all but I guess I will have to do my best.Well an interesting op ed piece, hope you enjoy reading it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-meier28-2010feb28,0,7835691.story"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/02/interesting-op-ed-piece-about.html", "title": "\nInteresting op-ed piece about schizophrenia\n"},
{"date": " March 9, 2010", "body": "\nI see that commercially successful memoirist who writes about his Asperger's syndrome, John Elder Robison, has been appointed to a scientific review board of autism speaks. Now neurodiversity will have a hard time whining about how autism speaks is excluding autistics. However, autism speaks has advertised to their potential donors that they are looking for a cure for autism. Yet they have appointed someone who writes on page 5 of his book that no cure is needed for at least some forms of autism. Of course, Robison, when he wrote those words a few years ago, was only talking about Asperger's and not the full spectrum of autism, so it is unclear to me how he would feel about a cure for all autism spectrum disorders (yes disorders not different way of thinking). However, this is not Robison's first gig as a research reviewer. in a previous gadfly post I wrote about his appointment to a public sector funding body, along with fellow anti-cure spectrumite Stephen Shore and becried the fact that these persons were appointed for their ability to garner publicity from conferences and/or books and questioned their qualifications for these posts as well as some of their anti-cure writings and viewpoints when in fact the passage of the combating autism act states quite clearly that the U.S. government has a pro-cure pro-prevention policy.John Robison read what I wrote and offered a very polite commentary to my blog post that was his position on the manner and suggesting I might write to the body if I wanted to be considered at some point. He also elaborated on his position about a cure, equating it with abortion:. . . First of all, as I said in response to another of your posts, I have never been opposed to therapies that address weakness in you, me, or anyone else. When working with NIH, I did my very best to vote for research that furthered the goal of finding ways to make all our lives better. What I am opposed to is the concept of autism elimination via abortion of future generations. That is what\u2019s meant by some people when they talk \u201ccure,\u201d and I don\u2019t like that. Another thing I don\u2019t like is the idea that certain people may want to mandate therapies for those of us on the spectrum. I believe we all deserve the right to choose. Personally, I would choose to try something that offered a good shot at making my life better, but I know others would choose to remain the same, and that\u2019s their right.With that in mind, I recognize that nonverbal autistic people present a difficult moral dilemma should therapies be available, but that\u2019s beyond the scope of this post. So it would appear to me that Robison is confused on the standard definition of a cure as defined by my dictionary: To restore to health soundness or normalcy. Though some might not like the word 'normal' and even I question its use in some instances, this is how the dictionary defines cure. It has nothing to do with abortions. As far as I know, John, has never stated that he believes autism speaks is deliberately trying to find ways to abort autistic fetuses as \"the autistic bitch from hell\" and other neurodiversity proponents have alleged, I have to wonder what his position on this is. As far as imposing treatments on others. We are talking about children who are not of the age of consent. Parents have a right to consent to surgery treatments, cancer treatments for their children, so why should autism be any different according to Robison? Also, we have compulsory education for children which the government mandates but parents control. As far as a moral dilemma for nonverbal children, then I don't see why someone serving in any capacity as an advisor to autism speaks should have a question about this. A person who is nonverbal might not be able to communicate effectively about their desire for a certain treatment even with an augmentative communication device.  I am reminded of Kevin Leitch of the right brain left brain blog who stated that he would only seek a cure for his nonverbal daughter if she asked him to.  Now what sense does that make? I am pretty sure the Wright's grandson was nonverbal. Jon Shestack and Portia Iversen who are members of the board of directors have a son who now nearly 18 is nonverbal. As a matter of fact I was nonverbal from age 2-1/2 to about 4, though I don't think Robison was. I believe it was a mistake to introduce Asperger's into the diagnostic lexicon and include them with persons on the autistic spectrum and include them with people who had a speech delay. So much of the research funded by AS has its intent and interest in helping persons who are nonverbal. It is not likely that Robison prior to 1994 would have been able to be considered a stakeholder or client in these research endeavors so I find these statements at least somewhat questionable. We also have to wonder what neurodiversity's reaction will be to this appointment. As I said before, at the risk of being repetitive, they will no longer be able to engage in angry tirades about autistics having no positions of power in AS. Will they be dancing in the streets? Of course, it would not be surprising if Robison got some of the slurs that have come my way, such as 'quisling' 'house autistic' or 'Nazi' or 'sell out;. Only time will tell. Autistic autism researcher Michelle Dawson happens to be one of the more vociferous individuals on this end. She has repeatedly criticized autism speaks for not having any autistics on the board or in positions of power. This is in spite of the ironic fact that AS has awarded a grant of nearly half a million dollars to the group that she works in, so they are certainly interested in funding autistic autism researchers including an autistic autism researcher who says that the people who raise money for her research \"make her sick\" and that the organization ideally wishes a short future for persons with autism.Robison stated in the above linked to post that he hoped to find some common ground between the pro-cure people and neurodiversity and that he hoped to serve both parties as a member of this board. I must respectfully disagree with him. The goal of autism speaks is curation and prevention (not abortion) of autism. Their goals have been quite plain since their inception as well as their predecessors Cure Autism Now and the national alliance of autism research. There is no place at all for neurodiversity proponents who call cure seekers and persons who want to prevent a child from becoming autistic in the first place eugenecists or nazis at the autism speaks table and I can only wish there never will be. I can only criticize autism speaks for trying to support neurodiversity rather than work against it, such as their removal of the I am autism video from their main website and their funding of the Laurent Mottron group (which Michelle Dawson is a part of) and having Morton Gernsbacher review scientific research for AS. I wish these activities would cease immediately and that AS could sever their ties to ND completely but I suppose that is unrealistic. Robison also gives RDI and ABA a shout out. To the best of my knowledge there have been no studies of RDI published in a peer reviewed journal. I don't think he understands all of the problems with ABA, how it is falsely advertised as having proven efficacy without aversives, the inequivalency of the intense treatment groups versus the control groups in Lovaas (1987), the lack of of adult outcomes in ABA therapy and the multitude of other problems with ABA. When CAN was in existence shortly before its merger with AS they funded behavioral therapy studies, violating their own bylaws to only fund medical research. Of course in spite of these criticisms I believe that John Robison does have the best of intentions and does want to help promote research that will help those on the spectrum and I wish him luck in his new position and endeavor. I suppose we will have to wait and see what the outcome and reaction to all of the parties concerned in this. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/03/09/robison/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/03/spectrumite-appointed-to-autism-speaks.html", "title": "\nspectrumite appointed to an autism speaks board\n"},
{"date": " March 27, 2010", "body": "\nIn a recent new york times article we see that the united states senate may be showing some good common sense and may be delaying a vote on confirming Ari Ne'eman's appointment to the national disabilities council due to his controversial neurodiversity views. A hold has been placed on Mr. Ne\u2019eman\u2019s nomination, which requires Senate confirmation.Whether the hold is related to the criticism of Mr. Ne\u2019eman (pronounced NAY-men) and what it might take to lift it is unclear. the article stated.I have noticed on looking at the stats of my blog that I was getting some hits from the United States senate seargent at arms URL. I can only hope that gadfly's pointing out that Ne'eman is being nominated to a disabilities council in spite of the fact he clearly does not even believe that autism is a disability or he considers himself disabled, yet presents himself as a disabled stakeholder could be the reason. Of course greater powers that be, such as autism speaks board member Jonathan Shestack may also realize that this is a bad nomination and may be intervening Shestack stated:\u201cWhy people have gotten upset is, he doesn\u2019t seem to represent, understand or have great sympathy for all the people who are truly, deeply affected in a way that he isn\u2019t,\u201d said Jonathan Shestack, a co-founder of the advocacy group Autism Speaks, whose mission is to help finance research to find a cure.This statement on Jon Shestack's part is interesting in light of the fact that he is on the board of directors of autism speaks, an organization that solicits for donations and advertises that it will go for a cure for autism, yet has helped authorized nearly half a million dollar funding for rogue neurodiversity researcher Laurent Mottron who has said that curing autism is nonsensical and has also said that autism is not a defect but merely a difference and has even said that autism is not harmful. Shestack justified Mottron's grant by saying that although the man made statements that were politically annoying he was doing work that was very important for nonverbal autistic persons. This is likely nothing more than wishful thinking on Shestack's part as he has a nonverbal son with autism who is about age 18.One possibility is some very right wing republicans who have contempt for Obama are merely holding up the nomination for political reasons and it has nothing to do with Ne'eman's neurodiversity beliefs. However, another line from the article makes that scenario less plausible:Mr. Obama\u2019s seven other nominees to the council were confirmed this month. But parliamentary procedure in the Senate allows one or more members to prevent a motion from reaching the floor for a vote by placing an anonymous hold on the action, which an official with knowledge of the proceedings said had been done in Mr. Ne\u2019eman\u2019s caseThis likely is a propitious sign that perhaps at least a few senators have seen the light, and see what a scam ND is and how harmful it is for persons with autism and their families. Had it just been a republican rebellion against Obama the other seven nominees most likely would not have been confirmed.The article goes on:Mr. Ne\u2019eman, who grew up in East Brunswick, N.J., has said his condition caused him to be bullied in high school. His social stress was so great, he sometimes picked at his face until it bled. He was eventually transferred to a school for students with developmental disabilities.This is interesting in light of the fact that we can judge Ne'eman by the company he keeps, such as ASAN members in good standing Harry Williams and Clay Adams who have spent extensive time bullying me on the internet yet Ne'eman has never censured these individuals in any way let alone expelling them from ASAN internet lists and other ASAN activities. I do know that Ne'eman had some sort of special education experience during my correspondence with him a couple of years ago, but I don't remember the exact circumstances. The statement that he was transferred to a school with developmental disabilities makes me wonder if he was ever mainstreamed before the age of 14 unlike myself, excluding one regular education private school that I was expelled from after about a half a semester due to my serious behavioral problems. So I wonder if Ne'eman could know what it was like to have gone to special ed schools for the greater portion of his childhood.I can only hope that this is an omen for a longshot senate rejection of Ne'eman's confirmation. I expected Ne'eman to be confirmed routinely, as I did not think anyone (not even John Shestack or individuals at Age of autism) had the stature or the numbers to actually affect the senate's vote on this type is appointment. NDC appointments are probably rubberstamped in most cases.I suspect Ne'eman will be confirmed in the end, but I can only hope that I am wrong. I certainly hope that during this hold up of Ne'eman's appointment that the senate will ask Ne'eman about his \"difference is not disability\" statement which he later edited. He will have a harder time covering up or editing his post that I pasted a couple of blog posts ago where he stated that he did not believe that Asperger's (which he has) is a disability. I certainly hope the senate asks him how he can legitimately present himself as a disabled stakeholder on the council on light of those statements. If this were a confirmation to the supreme court rather than the NDC I can imagine the hardball questions a number of senators would be asking him.I suspect the miracle of the senate rejecting Ne'eman's appointment won't happen, but I guess in light of this new development I can still hope and dream.Addendum:  In light of this new development, I have once again written to senators Boxer and Feinstein urging them to reject Ne'eman's appointment to the council\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/28/health/policy/28autism.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/03/senate-delaying-neeman-confirmation.html", "title": "\nsenate delaying Ne'eman confirmation?\n"},

{"date": " April 10, 2010", "body": "\nAnother update on my adventures at the cal tech emotions lab, co-starring Ralph Adolphs, Dan Kennedy, Katherine Holcomb and perhaps a few others. I was going to have a structural MRI scan which i think the purpose of was to get some baseline measurements of some resting activity of my brain and/or possibly to do connectivity studies using my brain as one of the sample brains. I have written previously in one place about my experiences many years ago being a research subject in a couple of MRI studies with the Eric Courchesne research group in San Diego many years ago. I also wrote about it in a dated blog post from almost two years ago.Right before I was last a research subject in the Courchesne group, Greg Allen, a graduate student at UCSD at the time, was doing a study involving functional MRI scanning which is different from structural imaging in that you have to do a task while being scanned and it measures the blood flow to various areas of the brain while doing the task. I agreed to be one of the subjects in this study. After a two hour drive to San Diego from L.A. I was not able to fit into the scanner along with the computer equipment that was in the scanner so that the person could do the task. I was not able to participate in that study.Well, the same thing happened last Wednesday. Apparently the technology of scans has changed and they have to put coil around your head in order to measure the brain. The coil for this machine was quite small and could not fit on my face so I was not able to participate in this study either. Katherine, who is the coordinator of research in the lab, told me that they have another scanner that has a larger coil that would likely fit me but they still did not have the software or other things they needed in that scanner and they would call me, so maybe I will still be able to participate at some point. Of course they do research involving functional MRI as well, so I might not be able to fit with the computer equipment in that one also. But we will see.I participated in some other studies that were not MRI, such as filling out a questionnaire, evaluating positive and negative emotions on these faces on a computer and taking some stuff that was apparently from an abridged version of the Wechsler IQ test.Apparently the review board the the CIT emotions lab is under does not allow people to know the results of their scans and is not allowed to show them pictures of their own brains, so I would not have been able to write the same stuff that I wrote in the past about my experiences with the Courchesne group anyhow. However, it was a disappoint that I could not participate as a subject at this time.I wanted to go to graduate school and become a brain researcher but my disability impaired me from getting there. I have written elsewhere about how rogue neurodiversity researcher Morton Gernsbacher trivialized my dreams. Being able to be a research subject is the next best thing, though not sure how much I will ever know about the brain and autism and ongoing research, let alone transcend the knowledge of Dan Kennedy, Matthew Belmonte, Ralph Adolphs and Eric Courchesne and others as per my pipe dream.

{"date": " April 22, 2010", "body": "\nI see that one of my favorite organizations, autism network international, which has an annual \"autreat\" has a list of their presenters now. Though I have never attended an autreat, as far as I know, I am still a member in good standing, being one of the earliest people to join this stellar organization back in the early 90s.  My history with ANI is rather interesting. In 1993 or so , I was told by my friend Kathy Lissner (now Kathy Lissner-Grant) whom I started to have a snail mail and phone correspondence with, thanks to our mutual pen pal, David Miedzianik, of an organization for persons on the autism spectrum that was starting worldwide. This was right at the time people were starting to recognize that autism was not uncommon in persons without intellectual impairments. Shortly before this I became one of the founding members of AGUA (adult gathering united autistic) back in 1993. AGUA only meets in the Los Angeles area. She and new best selling author Donna Williams and a fellow named Jim Sinclair had gotten together and started this organization and they were getting fellow autistics to join. They would also be producing a newsletter called \"Our Voice\" in which autistic people could publish their non-fiction writings. I was excited by this prospect. In 1994 if someone told me there were actually people on the autism spectrum who felt that autism was not a disease or disorder but merely a different way of being and they were actually opposed to curing autism, I would have thought they were nuts or putting me on. Little did I know that this organization would in part be the genesis of that ugly cult of deranged hatemongers called neurodiversity.I became a member, had two articles published in the original \"our voice\" newsletter. This was the first time I had actually published anything anywhere. It was rather exciting. Later Jim Sinclair would stop producing the newsletter. Just before they stopped publishing, I read a piece by Jim Sinclair and was shocked to see that he had written something saying that autism was not a disorder but a different way of being. How shocked he was that people would even fund medical research in autism and then compare it to diseases such as blood cancers which actually killed people. He wrote an editorial opposing medical funding of autism. This was sort of a turning point in my career as an autism gadfly as this was my first exposure to neurodiversity and the \"we don't need no stinkin' cure\" mentality.They also had an internet mailing list in the early days of the internet. They had a variety of rules that you could not talk about curing autism or autism as a bad thing and various other forms of censorship. Again, I was rather shocked and asked that I be removed from the mailing list.It seems I am still a member as every year they send me information and registration forms for their autreat. I am not sure how I can resign the organization and it is probably not worth my while to attempt to do so. So, one skeleton I have in my cupboard is that I am actually a member of a neurodiversity organization!Well, now that sordid history is out of the way, I read some of the presentations with interest.I see that rogue neurodiversity researcher Morton Gernsbacher with her son Drew Goldsmith and the infamous Amanda Baggs will be giving a presentation on how terrible the labels of high functioning and low functioning are. It is noted that Amanda has been called by low functioning and high functioning and she rejects both labels. I wonder what the difference is between the term \"low functioning\" as a relative term and \"severe\". Gernsbacher has no qualms about using the term \"severe\" to describe some persons with autism relative to others in her essay, autistics need acceptance and not cure. In this essay she stated that persons with severe autism have made great contributions to the arts and sciences yet neglects to cite a single example of such a person. Her son, allegedly autistic, was a high school senior at age 12.  Somehow I think the true problems that persons with autism face are an abstraction to Dr. Gernsbacher. In terms of getting her disability check and public housing, Amanda does not mind telling the government she is dysfunctional.  Most persons with an interest in ND know the story of Amanda attending college at age 14, persons who knew her stating she showed no signs of autism or disability, losing her speech at age 20, and then claiming an autism diagnosis, after previously claiming to be a schizophrenic and thinking she was an elf.They also have a presentation that deals with bullying and cyberbullying and how to counter it.  This is something neurodiversity is an expert at, having the vicious hate mongers such as Clay Adams, Harry Williams (Socrates), David Andrews and the late (but not great) \"Alyric\" who would spend time belittling and bullying anyone on the internet who would dare question the sacred cow of neurodiversity, particularly someone else on the spectrum of autism.  If club ND were really sincere, they would be giving a presentation giving lessons in bullying rather than ways to prevent, what they themselves truly promote. I see that Ari Ne'eman is giving a presentation that deals with prejudice against autistic persons.  Though I agree that prejudice does exist and to an extent ND has some legitimate issues, they only reinforce prejudice towards those of us on the spectrum, with their lies, propaganda and vicious hate.  Also, Ne'eman quite clearly does not even believe that autism is a disability through his previous statements that have been well-documented on autism's gadfly.  Therefore, he will mislead everyone and claim that if prejudice were eliminated autistics would function just fine in the world.  Though that may be true for this individual with a possible future as a lawyer and Rhoades Scholar, it is not true for the other 99.9% of us. I suppose it could have been worse.  Though I lacked the prescience not to have joined ANI in the first place, at least I never went to one of those autricks.  I wait once again for my annual letter with the form for enrolling in an autrick so I can joyfully chuck it in the wastebasket.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autreat.com/aut10presentations.html#EF"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/04/another-autreat-conference.html", "title": "\nAnother autreat conference\n"},

{"date": " April 21, 2010", "body": "\nLast night I was watching the Larry King show and comedienne Sarah Silverman was on plugging her new book which in part deals with her childhood problem of bedwetting.I have written about a number of problems that my autism has caused me in the past, my twiddling (self-stimulatory behaviors) which get in the way of my being able to accomplish things and are not unlike an insidious drug addiction. My ornithophobia (fear of birds) which inspired a short story that I wrote some years ago. I have also written about my lack of a social life, in particular lack of romantic relationships with women. I have also written, I think, about scholastic problems, social judgment and behavioral problems and my loud voice which repulses people. I have also written about my perceptual motor impairments and fine motor coordination problems which impairs my ability to handwrite and draw.  Also, are the funny movements I make which draw attention to myself. On watching the show with Ms. Silverman, I was reminded of my bedwetting which was a problem in my early childhood. It had been so removed from my past that I had forgotten about it for a while.Some old memories have been jogged and now for the past half day I have been thinking of the old days when I used to wet the bed chronically from as long as I can remember from my earliest childhood up until about age 10 or 11. Between ages 11 and 13 it declined but I would still wet the bed once in a while. Apparently, at about age 13 or 14, this stopped altogether. Aside from being almost completely nonverbal between ages two and a half to about four years old and then recovering my speech, this was the only autistic problem that was completely resolved by my outgrowing it.I still remember waking up in a urine-infested puddle during the night, absolutely stinking. Also, the urine would biochemically decompose into ammonia and it would sting like hell. I also recall the fights with my parents when they would restrict my fluids during the day and evening in order to try to solve or mitigate this problem. I knew that it was not normal and I did not know the cause of it. I knew it had something to do with my disability, which I later found out was an autism spectrum disorder.I still don't know the exact etiology, but I had read that bedwetting often resulted from psychological stress or problems of which I had many both due to my autism itself and the teasing and ridicule I would get from \"peers\" and from fights with my parents and my sister and some nasty and cruel things my therapist would say at times. Also it could be the result of a weak bladder due to the motor problems I have had ( and still have to this day).I was curious, so I googled a few things about autism and bedwetting. I found this interesting piece.  They talk about bedwetting is in fact common in children diagnosed with autism.  They cite lack of toilet training which I did not have a problem with at least from age 6 on.  They also talk about hypotonia as being one of the possible etiologies.  This might be in line with my motor coordination impairments. One interesting theory that one mother posited in the article was that bedwetting was due to damage in the areas of the cerebellum and basal ganglia as these are two areas of the brain that she said were known to be damaged in autism. The reports of problems of the cerebellum in autism have been well known, particularly loss of purkinje cells in various autopsy reports.  Also both Courchesne and a Japanese researcher named Hashimoto and possibly others have found problems in the vermis of the cerebellum on MRI scans.  However, this has not really been replicated on autopsies which show other parts of the cerebellum damaged and the vermis intact.I am not sure what research if any has shown basal ganglia damage in autism.  I do know that many years ago, Ralph Maurer and Antonio Demasio wrote a journal article suggesting that autism could be a problem with the frontal lobes and basal ganglia as a lot of the problems with autism had similarities between persons who as adults had lesions in these areas; this article predated the autopsies and MRI scans showing cerebellar abnormalities. Jeanne Brohart, the parent who postulated this theory, points towards the fact that the basal ganglia have motor control as one of their functions.  Of course one problem with this interpretation (as well as possibly Maurer and Demasio's old paper) is that both Eric Courchesne and Ralph Adolphs have told me that developmental lesions are different than adult lesions, so inferring functioning from adult brain problems as well as the functions the basal ganglia and other brain nuclei control, cannot necessarily be inferred in early childhood problems such as autism. Bedwetting was a real pain, as I said before, I had forgotten about it, but had my memory jogged after all these years by the King-Silverman interview.  I just hope that someday a cure or legitimate treatment can be found so that bedwetting and other issues won't be a problem for persons with autism, and now we can add another thing that makes autism bad in perhaps a fairly good number of persons who have this condition.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061987076/The_Bedwetter/index.aspx", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/stories/orn.html", "http://www.childrentoday.com/articles/bedwetting/autism-and-bedwetting-1494/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/04/bedwetting-another-autistic-problem.html", "title": "\nBedwetting: another autistic problem?\n"},

I should have known the hiatus would be ephemeral. Gadfly gave his take on these people who wear black hats in a previous post.Some of the same blogs have been kept, such as Estee Klar who states that those of us with autism should take joy in having a handicap and horrific disability. Also, Left brain right brain, the blog that was basically the progenitor of this hideous hub has been kept.Among blogs on the science side, are the autism crisis blog. So Michelle Dawson who can state that science is not politics and say that it is fine that she and the people she works with can accept a half a million dollar grant from an organization which she has stated in the past ideally wishes a short future for those with autism.They also have an archive. They apparently have added the blog of the deceased hatemonger \"Alyric\" who took joy in making abusive and condescending comments to your humble blogger, particularly about his special education experiences, as if she had any knowledge of being developmentally disabled that was not an abstraction. For those with a wave of nostalgia the archives of autism diva's blog has been kept though it has apparently been close to three years since she has posted anything.Saliently lacking is The New Republic blog of \"Socrates\" who apparently from my limited knowledge of the situation was considered somewhat of a trouble maker in the hub's blogosphere and was apparently a factor in Dave Seidel's and \"Hollywood Jaded's\" \"bailout\" as administrators of the old hub.Another blog missing from the list is the Whose Planet is it Anyway blog of \"The autistic bitch from hell\" I guess she still has her blog so I won't be deprived from reading about how autistics who want a cure for their condition should be taken out and shot or strangled to death and turned into cat food . The rumor mill has it that \"the autistic bitch from hell\" is in fact the nom de plume of one Meg Evans. I will emphasize that I am not certain that these two individuals are the same person. I just know what I read in the preceding link. The discerning reader can follow the link and judge for themselves.Meg Evans is an individual high up in the board of directors of ASAN. An organization that claims to be in favor of civil rights and dignity for persons with autism. As most who follow this blog know, ASAN's leader, Ari Ne'eman, has an appointment to the national council on disabilities pending in the U.S. Senate, even though gadfly has provided overwhelming evidence that in fact Mr. Ne'eman does not even believe that he himself has a disability or that autism is a disability, yet has presented himself as a stakeholder. He has also been appointed to the IACC, who coordinates the funding of biologic research in autism, though he has stated he opposed biologic research with the aim of curing autism. Ms. Evans claims to have been diagnosed as autistic as a child, yet is a lawyer who graduated from Case Western Reserve Law school, was able to get married and have two children. One has to wonder if in fact the ABFH and Ms. Evans are one in the same that the government should be appointing a leader from an organization to various posts who has in his organization as executive board of directors someone who has such a flippant attitude towards the lives of autistics whose philosophy she does not happen to agree with.Most notable of all is the exclusion of the comet's corner blog whose author Clay Adams is one of the most vicious and cruel hatemongers in the ND movement and who seems to have a morbid obsession with your humble blogger, constantly belittling him, making fun of him and writing libelous statements about him. The blog has been taken over by new administrators who one hopes don't have the callous attitude that Dave Seidel and his cronies had towards autistic people who really do suffer from their condition, have been veterans of special education and who can't get married or hold down a job unlike many of the members past and present of the hub himself included.They also give some other information in various parts of the new hub that I will let the interested reader find for themselves. One statement that intrigued this blogger:The Hub will continue to carefully review and bring some of the best autism blogging from around the web, to visitors and other Autism Hub bloggers \u2013 you know, the kind of blogging that is respectful of autistic people insightful, sometimes scientific, but always thought-provoking and mindful of the Hub\u2019s stated mission:-------Well the rest of the statement is about their baloney of promoting rights and diversity to make themselves look more acceptable than they were in the good old days when their motto was \"We don't want no stinkin' cure\". Of course I have to laugh at this highlighted statement. Does this mean that such August blogs as The New Republic, Comet's Corner and Whose planet is it anyway, won't be continued on the new hub? Not necessarily, as they have another statement saying that though not all of the old blogs were included that even if they did not make the first cut, persons whose blogs were not included can resubmit their blogs to the hub for the consideration. It is not impossible that these blogs will be back on the hub.   It can also be noted that they have stated the hub is under anonymous administrators and has been financed by \"an anonymous benefactor with no financial interest in autism\".  One must wonder about these anonymous people, who this benefactor is who spends money on this cult of hatred and propaganda and why he/she wishes to remain anonymous.  Apparently, the new administrators wish to be anonymous, so people whose blog posts go over the line won't have to be accountable to persons whose libelous statements might actually put them in legal jeopardy as administrators of the new hub. Of course, the hiatus of the hub, did mean the dagger did pierce the figurative skin, even though it was not put entirely through the heart.

I discussed the work of one of my idols, Marco Iacoboni and his wife Mirella Dapretto who have done work showing that certain areas of the brain that have been shown not only to be involved in motor responses but in the learning of motor responses and the firing when other people are doing them might be involved in the etiology of autismRecently, a researcher named Ilan Dinstein along with several coauthors has published work refuting the mirror neuron hypothesis in autism.  Though this is just one study, out of many replicated studies showing dysfunction in the mirror neuron systems.  The media has picked this up and in some instances implied that it refutes the mirror neuron hypothesis of autism.  It is Dinstein's contention that the previous mirror neuron studies in autism have not assessed for selectivity of cortical activity in mirror system areas for particular movements.  For example a different set of mirror neurons may respond differently to a thumbs down movement seen and/or executed than a thumbs up movement.  Their results showed that the autistic subjects had the same cortical responses during observation and execution of the movements.  They observed repeated versus nonrepeated movements, showing that the autistics had the same responses as the controls on motor fatigue, i.e., the mirror neurons programmed for a certain type of movement getting used to the image of thumbs up, thumbs down or a hawaian hang loose hand sign.   Dr. Dapretto's work, however, was a little different in that she observed reactions to various facial expressions.    It is possible that hand movements are mediated differently than facial responses.  In other studies Dinstein and colleagues assert that movement selectivity was not controlled for and this confounded the results. Again, Dinstein's work has one of the same problems so rampant in autism research in that the current research techniques are not suitable for lower functioning autistics with IQ's of less than 100 due to movement in an MRI scanner and lack of compliance.  The subjects were also older than those in Dapretto's work, average age of 27, whereas Dapretto used all children, so this might limit comparison.  One possibility is that even if autism's etiology in higher functioning persons is due to mirror neuron dysfunction that they might develop compensatory functions in adulthood. Apparently the autistics and the controls were not matched on IQ.  Also they were not matched on gender.  All of the autistic subjects were male, half the controls female, and men and women certainly have different brain physiologies and possibly responses. To summarize Dinstein and his coauthors argue that the entire mirror neuron areas in the frontal and parietal lobes were measured in other studies (If I am not misunderstanding this, anyone can correct me in comments if i am wrong and I will edit the post) They measured specific brain areas as well as the habituation of repeated exposure to these specific which they claim is necessary to show whether or not mirror neurons are an issue in autism.  The results, they claim suggest that there is no mirror neuron impairment in autism.  It seemed to me that Dinstein was implying that artifacts could have contributed to some of the positive findings of mirror neurons in autism, such as autistics imitating the movement more slowly than healthy controls.  Also, the fact that they did not select for areas of particular movements in the prior studies suggest that other areas than mirror neurons could have been recruited such as visual areas and working memory. But Iacoboni is apparently standing by his work and stating that the results don\u2019t prove what the researchers say they do, because their trick of focusing on fatigued neurons will miss some mirror neurons. Furthermore, he says, simply testing brain activity involved in identifying and mimicking movements does not accurately model the brain activity underlying complex social tasks.On a more personal note, when I read Dinstein's study, it elicited an emotional response for me.  I don't know whether to believe Iacaboni/Dapretto or Dinstein.  Of course, if I am not mistaken there is a lot of evidence in the literature that suggests that mirror neurons may play an etiologic role in autism and Dr. Dinstein's study has not yet been replicated by an independent investigator.    For almost all of my life I have wanted to know what caused my problems.  Of course there were the various theories I have heard throughout my life.  I first heard in the 1960s it was in part because I saw my sister naked when she was born nearly 3 years after I was and I noticed she did not have something I had and I was worried mine would be cut off.  This was one of the standard beliefs during the Bettelheim era of the 1950s and 1960s, which, as I have written before, I am an actual veteran of, unlike most persons in the autism blogosphere.  I then heard about the cerebellar things that Courchesne wrote about, but that did not seem to tell me a whole lot.  Then there was the mirror neuron stuff which was very intriguing.  But my pipe dream of knowing exactly what has caused this horrible disability in myself will most likely not be fulfilled.  I was even more frustrated to read the stuff that Michelle Dawson and Morton Gernsbacher write about how autistics brains are not damaged variations of neurotypical brains. In a fit of frustration, I did sort of a silly thing ( I do and say silly things because of my disability sometimes) and I wrote Dr. Iacaboni an email asking him if he would make a statement on his twitter and facebook pages (which I read from time to time) about Dinstein's study and what the implications were for the result of his own work.  I wrote to him about my frustration and anger and how I wish I could find out exactly what was wrong with me and how frustrated I was with Gernsbacher and some others.  I told him that I would understand if he did not wish to answer me.He wrote me a very nice reply back stating that there were numerous methodological problems in Dinstein's work but that given that it was nearing the end of the academic year he was busier than he usually was assisting students in graduating from graduate school and other things, but that he was revamping the website of their lab and was going to add a blog where he would go by a blow by blow of the problems with the current study and that he would tweet about it soon.  He also gave me some advice on how I could work on my attitude.I enjoyed very much receiving a reply from this well known and eminent neuroscientist and stellar individual whose book \"mirroring people\" I read last year. Of course I am too low functioning and my knowledge of science and research methodology is probably too limited to determine which of the two are correct.  Of course there is the old saying about killing the messenger.  I guess I can't be angry at either Iacoboni or Dinstein for disagreeing and not being able to give me some real answers as to what the etiology of my handicaps are.I guess I will have to live and make do without some real answers.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cell.com/neuron/retrieve/pii/S0896627310002370"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/05/mirror-neuron-minutae-revisited.html", "title": "\nmirror neuron minutae revisited\n"},
{"date": " June 2, 2010", "body": "\nI have written the following to my congressman, senators and president Obama. I realize this is probably about as effective as writing a letter to Santa Claus but I have done it anyhow. I am going to share the contents with the readers of autism's gadfly:Mr. Congressman: I am an individual on the autism spectrum now in my mid 50s who longs for a cure for autism. I realize that this is not realistic in my lifetime. I am celibate. I have not worked in over 3 years and I have been unsuccessfully trying to get on disability for nearly 3 years now. I constantly talk loudly and make funny movements which draws attention to myself. I have very poor fine motor coordination and can hardly handwrite. I have various phobias. As a very young child I was almost completely nonverbal. I have been constantly fired from jobs (probably about 20 now) and had to give up working. i am very frustrated by this disability.The reason I write to you is that I am very concerned about various autism policies that are now put in place by the federal government.I am concerned about the creation of the combating autism act and the subsequent creation of the interagency autism coordinating committee. Though the law has stipulated that there must be at least one autistic member, there are currently two members, Stephen Shore and Ari Ne'eman. Both of these individuals have expressed opposition to curing autism in spite of the spirit of the law. Both of these persons are barely affected by their autism if at all. In fact Ari Ne'eman has stated that curing autism would be morally reprehensible. He has advocated a moratorium on all genetic research. Genetics may be in fact the 'ace in the hole' for finding future treatments or at least ensuring that future generations of children wll not be affected as I have. I do not believe either of these individuals should serve in the government in any capacity on autism related matters. I urge you to introduce legislation expelling these individuals from the IACC or introducing legislation to abolish the IACC and/or voting against reauthorization of the combating autism act when that comes up.John Elder Robison, is another individual who has expressed opposition for curing certain autism disorders other than his own, yet he can be a best selling author, get a $100,000/year engineering job and get married twice. These are things beyond my capacity. He is allowed to review federally funded autism research apparently only because of his incredible celebrity. I do not believe persons who express opposition to a cure such as Robison should be reviewing grants for federally funded research. The same goes for Stephen Shore who does this as well as being a public member of the IACC. I hope these celebrity review of research by those opposed to a cure should stop.I also would like to comment on the federal goverment's funding of autism researcher Morton Anne Gernsbacher. This is a woman who has publically opposed a cure and who in fact has stated that autism is a harmless condition. I was hoping you could introduce legislation to terminate her funding from the army, air force, NIH and lastly the CDC. It is interesting that she receives funding from the CDC yet does not believe that autism is a disease.Thanks for your consideration in this matter.Jon Mitchell\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/06/emails-to-elected-officials.html", "title": "\nemails to elected officials\n"},

Even the very optimistic Joseph of the autism natural variation blog has placed it as 75% .  Though Joseph is quite vague as to where this statistic comes from.  When asked by gadfly, he was not able to give an answer, except assuring me he did not make it up, as he claims autism speaks and other organizations just made up the 80% divorce rate among parents with autistic children. However, no need to fear, Ari is here. The solution to the unemployment problem among autistics is simple. All we have to do is eliminate social pleasantry in the workplace as a criteria for hiring and a criteria for evaluating someone's job performance.  Then autistics will be able to be employed and do just fine.  Gee, Ari, why didn't someone think of this before?

This is the week that the famous autrick (ooops I mean autreat) annual conference is held. I wrote about this two months ago You can see from the preceding link that some of the most august individuals in the neurodiversity movement, such as Morton Gernsbacher, her offspring Drew Goldsmith and Amanda Baggs, and Ari Ne'eman and Jim Sinclair and others will be giving presentations.I see from updates on facebook and other places that a few other individuals I had not mentioned before will be attending this neurodiversity preachathon (thanks and a tip of the gadfly hat to Roger Kulp for coming up with that term) such as the well known hatemonger Clay Adams, Not to mention Alex Plank who is well known for his slipshod journalism on that stellar website Wrong Planet and is also known for claiming that most autistics don't want to be cured without providing any evidence or consulting me, Roger Kulp, Jake Crosby, Stephanie Keil or Oliver Canby and JediKnight and numerous others who long for a cure for this affliction. Apparently Phil Gluyas could not make it from Australia to complete the roster of some of the more stellar neurodiversitites in attendance.Another member of the spectrum who will likely not be in attendance this year is \"Droopy\" who claims that one of the presenters, Amanda Baggs, copied her life. Though your humble blogger would never attend this unsavory conclave, Droopy has in fact tried to register for this event. She has not been allowed to attend, the belief of the ANI folks that she would be disruptive and cause trouble. I won't be a judge of whether or not Droopy should be allowed to attend.Another alternative, would be to steal some of Ari Ne'eman's and ASAN's thunder and organize a demonstration outside of ANI with placards and give neurodiversity a taste of the medicine that they have foisted upon autism speaks. Those of us who are pro-cure don't have the capital and abilities to do these things as Ne'eman and his pals do, apparently. Particularly travelling to Pennsylvania where the autrick is being held.Of course if ANI had a few million dollars in their coffers that they were not discussing, but wanted to dole out to some worthy cause, hopefully those of us wearing the white hats would be too ethical to accept it. The same can't be said of the ND crowd who have accepted half a million dollars from an organization who they claim wants to engage in genocide against them.Of course the bright side is that ND conferences are few and far between. They have still not acquired the capital to have conferences in the same vein as the biomed groups, such as the infamous autism one conference and the unlocking autism conferences and other big conferences. So they can't afford to pay the speaking fees that quasi superstars like Stephen Shore can generate. Oh well, ND, better luck next year.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/06/autrick-or-treat.html", "title": "\nautrick or treat\n"},
{"date": " June 20, 2010", "body": "\nDr. Thomas Armstrong has a new book out with the offensive title Neurodiversity discovering the extraordinary gifts of autism ADHD, Dyslexia and other brain differences. This book has been given blurbs by two of the most august members of the neurodiversity movement, Ari Ne'eman and the grand dame of ND herself Kathleen Seidel.I have just read the book and one of its most striking features is its predictability in certain areas. We are reminded that dyslexia would not be handicapping in an agrarian society, that in certain cultures schizophrenics would be shamans or medicine men, etc. It also deals with the flawed concept of conditions such as autism and schizophrenia remaining in the population due to evolutionary advantages. Like other nongeneticists Temple Grandin and Simon B-C, Armstrong neglects to take into account de novo mutations.It deals with the idea that none of these multiple conditions would be disabling if one were to adapt to a certain environment, a concept that Armstrong calls 'niches'. We have the comparison of Spiders spinning webs and Beavers building dams as to how a person with autism or another neurodiverse condition can adapt to their environment. For example persons with autism are good with computers so they can move to the silicon valley and get an IT job. Armstrong claims that the prevalence of autism is greater in the silicon valley then in the general population. However we see that data from the CDDS contradict this notion. Of the 21 regional centers serving the CDDS in California we see that the San Andreas regional center ranked 9th out of 21 in the growth of autism prevalence, falling far behind the West Los Angeles regional center and the Lanterman regional center in central Los Angeles. Since the growth in the administrative prevalence of autism in the regional centers parallels the growth of the IT industry, these data could be considered relevant.He steals Temple Grandin's thunder by listing jobs that are suitable for persons with various brain differences but neglecting to cite a single example of anyone with these conditions who was successfully employed in these occupations. This is in spite of the fact that Armstrong lists a 6% employment rate among autistics though I am not sure where he obtains this figure. This contradicts the 25% figure given by Joseph of the natural variation blog who also does not seem to know where he obtained his figure when questioned about it.Amanda Baggs is also mentioned in the book Her \"In my Language\" video is extolled and she is compared to a professional percussionist. Computers and the internet are given as examples of successful niche construction on Amanda's part and Amanda is quoted as boasting that her caretakers would not be able to do what she does on the internet. However, Amanda's other video where she shows how much trouble she has with boiling water is not mentioned.Armstrong states that for some reason that is not apparent to this blogger that Amanda's situation overturns tacit assumptions about autism. Interestingly, Armstrong neglects to discuss that Amanda up until she was a teenager had normal speech, went to a college for gifted children at age 14, had no behavior manifestations that would suggest anything remotely similar to autism as verified by many of her classmates and acquaintances. Apparently by a strange coincidence during a time when Amanda was ingesting in nearly daily doses of LSD for a lengthy period she had some sort of break and thought she was an elf and was diagnosed as schizophrenic rather than autistic. Then apparently was mysteriously diagnosed as autistic well in her 20s.The studies showing that autistics have superior scores in certain tests such as embedded figures, block design, perfect pitch, etc. are also discussed. Armstrong implies that these studies refer to all autistic people and not necessarily a limited research pool whom would be considered high functioning. Also one wonders what sort of job or life skill or ability to adjust to the world high scores on these tests are correlated with. I score in the retarded range on block design so this would not apply to me. He gives savant musician Leslie Lemke, artist Stephen Wiltshire and Daniel Tammet's accomplishments as proof of autistic superiority, implying that just a few handful of people-these examples can be applied to many thousands if not more than a million worldwide.He gives examples of how well suited an autistic person would be able to tell edible berries from a predator's eyes in a primitive society and how much rather he would be with someone constructing a spear or making a fire regardless of their social deficiencies. He does discount the possibility that motivational impairments might prevent these so-called systematizers as Baron-Cohen calls them from applying their skills. Of course exception to rule Temple Grandin is listed as an example of this. No matter that most persons on the spectrum are not like that and are probably not too employable.Armstrong then gives examples of the studies that two members of Laurent Mottron's research team, Michelle Dawson and Isabelle Soulieres showing how autistics could be lifted out of the intellectually impaired classrooms based on the published studies of these two exemplary researchers. He cites Dawson's study where autistics scored much higher on Raven's matrices than the Wechsler and Souleries' study where autistics are able to do Raven's matrices 40% faster than non-autistic controls.He neglects to mention the methodologic problems of these two studies Dawson excluded autistics with known genetic conditions which would probably mean at least 10% of all autistics. If this percentage were applied to autistics with intellectual disabilities, the percentage would likely be even higher. There was a 12:1 male/female ratio in her study as opposed to 4:1 in the general population of autistics. At least some of these autistics were high functioning with nearly normal intelligence, even though there were some low functioning persons who scored much or at least substantially higher on the Raven's than on the Wechsler.Though Dawson et. al. implied that their control group in the study was neurotypical, this was hardly the case. Rather than being representative of the general population of non-autistics they were a self-selected sample recruited from a newspaper ad whose average score on the Wechsler was 75th percentile, sorry but an average of 75th percentile of any population is certainly not typical. It presented a comparison of one atypical group to another atypical group.To date, Dawson's work has not been replicated. In fact there are two at least partial nonreplications, one by Sven Boelte. Though some persons in Boelte's study did have a higher RPM score than Wechsler the effect was much less pronounced than in Dawson's study and was limited to lower functioning autistics with IQs less than 85. There was no effect on the higher functioning group. Kim Boddner has also done an IMFAR presentation showing that there is no difference on Wechsler's vs. Raven's in relatively high functioning autistics whose IQs are 85 or higher.In spite of this Souleries, in an act of statistical legerdemain, based her study on the fact that this effect existed in high functioning autistics in spite of the two nonreplications. One reason, of course that Souleries did not use lower functioning persons in her research was likely due to noncompliance issues which would cause artifacts on an MRI scan, which was part of her study. She stated the superiority of Raven's versus Wechsler in higher IQ autistics as fact rather than a statement of contention. Her use of speed in the Raven's was also nonstandard as it is not a timed test.Though the book clearly has a pro neurodiversity perspective, one wonders would at least one of the two blurbees, namely Ne'eman be happy with this book. The answer is no, because Armstrong does concede that autism, schizophrenia and other conditions do present grave problems for the individuals affected. We have seen from the meticulous documentation on autism's gadfly that Ne'eman most likely does not even believe that autism is a disability.Armstrong also seems to deviate from some of the other tenets of the ND movement, at least as it applies to autism, though not necessarily some of the other neurodiverse conditions such as schizophrenia or affective \"differences\". He uses Howard Gardner's \"Frames of Mind\" book to show how different people can have different intelligences. He speculates that dysfunctions in the limbic system but other areas being intact in an autistic could lead to them having superior math skills yet significant social deficits. The ND belief is that autism is not limited to just some parts of the brain but that the autistic brain is hardwired from birth and that to cure a person of autism would be killing them as a human being. In fact neurodiversity hatemonger, the late \"Alyric\" once called me Jonathan I want to destroy myself Mitchell because of my longing for a cure for this horrible affliction.He also writes some interesting things about special education, stuff about kids being bullied, having low self-esteem due to having to be in special education and the stories of physical abuse of children in special education schools. I experienced all these first-hand growing up as a special education student throughout the 1960s, so indeed this did resonate with me.He discusses how special education should be changed so that the emphasis is on strengths rather than on deficits but is rather vague on how this could be accomplished. For example he just goes as far as telling how it would be good to tell a student how helpful they are in cleaning up a lunch room or how well they sing in a musical performance. He also advocates a \"neurodiverse classroom\" where instead of one teacher teaching an entire class there would be multiple teachers and aides and specialized accommodations involving specialized personnel to help with mobility or signing issues. Armstrong really does neglect to tell how the tab would be picked up for all these goodies given the fact that local school districts have such difficulty in providing funding for special education as it is and the nearly complete neglect of the federal government doing so, since contrary to popular belief the IDEA is an unfunded mandate with no legal obligation to provide funding by the federal government.Ironically Armstrong talks about combating \"ableism\" and implies that a large part of the problem for persons with neurologic impairments in the workplace is this prejudice. Though I don't deny prejudice does exist I had a disability that impaired my performance in the workplace, though I did work sporadically with marginal success. Though my intelligence was more than intact I could not be in a regular education classroom as a young child due to behavioral issues.I have to wonder if Armstrong ever reads any of the neurodiversity blogs or the comments section of the blogs. I don't see how anyone who does so cannot come to an alternative conclusion that the neurodiversity crowd are among the greatest \"ableists\" of all. From the condescending ridicule I received from Alyric regarding my special education experiences, from the mocking of my mediocre college performance by hatemonger David Andrews who was the one who encouraged Baron-Cohen to write that despicable essay on how high functioning autism should not be considered a disability and Andrews trying to show how superior he was to me because I could not do as well academically as he did or get a masters degree and hang out my shingle and practice, even in a very foreign country like Finland as he has done. Don't forget the cheap shots at my celibacy made by \"Socrates\" who in spite of being unemployed and homeless seems to imply that he is God's gift to women. Last but not least is the vicious hate I receive routinely from Clay Adams who was able to serve in the Navy, be gainfully employed in various contracting jobs, often being the lead man on crews and was able to get married and support two children. Bigotry and ableism are certainly pervasive on many of the hub blogs past and present.The bottom line is, whatever assets persons with autism allegedly have, the social deficits produce either a zero sum or negative gain in functioning. I think this is proven by the relatively high functioning persons who are part of the autism hub and various ND cliques. This is something for Armstrong to think about.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/neurodiversity.php"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/06/thomas-armstrongs-book-on.html", "title": "\nThomas Armstrong's book on neurodiversity\n"},

{"date": " August 4, 2010", "body": "\nAs regular readers of autism's gadfly know, I have written about how neurodiversity idealogues Laurent Mottron and Michelle Dawson have been awarded half a million dollars in funding from autism speaks in spite of the fact they are opposed to the idea that autism is a disorder or disease and this is the basis of autism speaks fundraisers.Below you can view one in a series of videos made by neurodiversitite Alex Plank and Jack \"Cubby\" Robison.You notice this video deals with Wired Magazine writer Steve Silberman, author of the infamous \"geek syndrome\" article that appeared in that magazine nine years ago or so stating his ambition to write a book detailing the great achievements of those with asperger's throughout history and how many scientific discoveries were made by those on the spectrum.You can check out the credits in the beginning and at the end of the video and you will notice the logo for Plank's website wrongplanet.net. You also note the logo of another famous autism organization.Checking with Cubby Robison's father, John Robison, I wondered if autism speaks had funded this video given their name appears in the credits. The answer would seem to be in part yes, they underwrote some of the travel expenses and possibly some other things for Plank's and Robison's video.We have seen in the past that Plank has wrongly accused autism speaks of intimidating a blogger and getting a website to stop the sale of his t-shirts. Two years after the fact Plank still has this false story on his website and has never offered a retraction or apology.Alex Plank has some choice words about autism speaks apparentlyHe states:Actually, most autistics feel that these nonprofits are doing a disservice to those living with Autism by running campaigns that dehumanize people with the condition and painting an inaccurate picture of what Autism is like. For example, Autism Speaks, the largest Autism organization in terms of financial capital, has no autistic employees and no board members with the condition. They disallow autistic individuals from speaking at their conferences with the rationale that \"it wouldn't be appropriate.\" While a lot of the research they fund may be conducted by good scientists who are unaware of the organization's political slant, Autism Speaks' end-game is establishing prenatal screening. Any good that comes from this research is consequently undermined by the negative messages they send.In addition to being impressed by Alex's omniscience in knowing what most autistic people think, I am intrigued by the old neurodiversity fear mongering maligning autism speaks by claiming they are trying to establish prenatal screening to abort autistic fetuses when there is no evidence to suggest this whatsoever. I have to wonder why autism speaks would pick up the tab for a person who has treated them in this manner and makes the nasty inflammatory statements that Plank has made about their organization and even written libelous things about them in the past.It is embarrassing to admit that Robison asked me if I would consider participating in an interview. For a brief moment I said I would consider it though they would have to come here to Los Angeles to interview me. I now realize it was a mistake on my part to consider it for even a moment.There are autistic people who can't speak and who self-injure themselves and when most of us are unemployed and autism speaks talks about the importance of employing persons with autism in their autism in the workplace dog and pony show in spite of the fact there is not a single example of a person with autism as far as I know who has obtained a job due to any action of autism speaks. There is the fact that many of us can't find romantic relationships, can't get things done during the day, have phobias and have trouble functioning. Gadfly wonders about the priorities of autism speaks and why these videos would be financed in any way shape or form. What would parents such as the well known KGAccount who makes videos of her very low functioning son who will likely never function at a level of an Alex Plank or Jack Robison think if they were donating to AS and participating in walks for the organization if they found out their money was being spent on videos putting such a positive spin on Asperger's. I can only wonder what in the world autism speaks is thinking or why they would consider this money well spent.I guess there are just some things in this world I will never understand.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wrongplanet.net/article361.html", "http://www.youtube.com/user/kgaccount#p/u/26/1lNTZYu2Thc"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/08/autism-speaks-picks-up-part-of-tab-for.html", "title": "\nAutism speaks picks up part of tab for Alex Plank videos\n"},
{"date": " July 28, 2010", "body": "\nThere is an interesting new study put out recently by Brigham Young University that seems to demonstrate that social relationships or lack of social relationships can determine life expectancy and physical health just as much as smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, etc. This study claimed to show that lack of social relations was equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, being an alcoholic, not exercising and twice as harmful as obesity.I wonder how this bodes for persons with autism spectrum disorders such as myself whose opportunities for social interaction are quite limited. I wonder how this will affect my life expectancy and others who have autism.As I have repeatedly tried to point out on autism's gadfly, the neurodiversity dictum \"autism is not like cancer, does not need to be cured because it does not kill\" has often been disproven by lower functioning autistics who are hit by cars, die in accidental drownings, get lost in snowstorms, etc.This study that I have linked to may provide further ammo against the ND arguments. I would be interested in studying the question of whether an autistic person's lack of social relations would cause a shortening of their life expectancy or possibly increase the risk of other concomitant health problems such as stroke, heart attacks, etc.Of course the first persons diagnosed with autism were not born until close to the mid 1930s so, this might be problematic in studying the question if anyone were ever interested in studying it. I know that some persons who believe in an autism epidemic believe the prevalence of autism among adults is much lower than that of persons born in the mid 1980s and later. Assessing the prevalence of autism in adults is problematic for a variety of reasons and it is beyond the scope of this post to discuss them. This might make the question of the effects that autistic's social impairments affect their health and longevity difficult to study. I would be curious how lack of friends, marriage etc. would impact the health and life expectancy of those with autism and similar problems. Of course such a study might not ever be done.Joseph of the autism natural variation blog has made the very strong statement that autistics are half as likely to marry as their nonhandicapped peers. He bases this contention on one study that alleged that there was a 1% prevalence of autism among adults in the UK. This study had a myriad of methodological problems such as nonstandard use of assessments and in actually guestimates of how many persons with autism were out there. The prevalence of marriage of autistic people that Joseph cites was based on only 19 people. So if the population of the UK were around 10 million adults or more (probably more) Joseph is claiming that statistical inferences can be made from a sample consisting of not much more than .01% of its parent population. No I don't think so. So, no I don't believe that autistics are half as likely to marry as their neurotypical peers.Of course the ND solution is acceptance. If only society would accept autistic people no matter how they behave, then they would have friends and lovers. Of course this is certainly not realistic and it is never going to happenAri Ne'eman has now been appointed to the IACC by the Obama administration in spite of the fact he has stated that he is opposed to all genetic research on autism and wishes to impose a moratorium on all genetic research.However, I believe the BYU study may be yet another reason to try to use science, including genetic research, that might at some point in time to find treatments that will help autistic people and even possibly cure them. The lack of social opportunities for those of us on the spectrum may be killing us slowly.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100727174909.htm", "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/11/marriage-among-autistics-or-why-nhs.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/07/lack-of-social-relationships-may.html", "title": "\nlack of social relationships may shorten autistic's life expectancy\n"},
{"date": " July 22, 2010", "body": "\nI see that ASAN member and neurodiversity activist Sarah Pripas, author of the Cat's in a dog's world blog, is at it again, accusing those of us with an interest in autism who are either parents of autistic children or those of us on the spectrum ourselves who wish a cure or help for this condition of being responsible for murder. It is very sad when an autistic child is killed by their parents. No rational person would justify this. Certainly this woman in Texas was insane as are all others who murder their autistic children. To claim that the desire for a cure leads to this is nothing but hateful fear mongering. However, it seems to be the contention of the ND movement and the autistic self advocacy network that the desire to cure autism is what leads these people to murder their kids. Ari Ne'eman has stated that in a testimony before the IACC that there were some people who believe that autism speaks is morally complicit with murder. Even if he did not come right out and say it, he was giving this idea credibility which should have no more credibility than the flat earth society. The admittedly stupid remarks that Allison Tepper Singer made in a video sponsored by autism speaks about sometimes feeling like driving her car off a bridge with her daughter in it was somehow responsible for the murder of Katie McCarron and other autistic children, according to ND and ASAN. How absurd is this. How many people who desire a cure really consider murdering their autistic children? This sort of propaganda only leads to hate and fear. I take great offense to being blamed for the murder of autistic children just because I wish a better life for myself.It is interesting that the media on a not infrequent basis reports on autistic children who are killed in drownings, being hit by cars, trains, being lost in a snowstorm and freezing to death. Somehow neurodiversity and ASAN members never bat an eye when this happens (though the one exception was when Ari Ne'eman expressed his condolences over Ashley Brock's death by drowning on Ginger Taylor's Adventures in autism blog).Give it a rest Sarah and the rest of ASAN and ND! No one is going to take you seriously. You conned the Obama administration into getting Ari Ne'eman appointed to the NDC and IACC. You are only hurting your own cause with such hateful propaganda. Your post only leads to hatred and bitterness and divisiveness.This is one of the many reasons (perhaps the most important one) that neurodiversity and ASAN need to be opposed.  I apologize to gadfly readers if this post, written on the fly, is rambling and incoherent and not as well written as it should be, but this sort of crap from ND and ASAN ticks me off to no end!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticcats.blogspot.com/2010/07/where-ableism-leads.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/07/where-asan-and-neurodiversity-leads.html", "title": "\nWhere ASAN and neurodiversity leads\n"},
{"date": " July 14, 2010", "body": "\nI was interested to to read a post on the It's Tabi's time blog by a youthful neurodiversity blogger about an individual who has autism who is about 28 years old and is a virgin and apparently complains about his celibacy, stalks women, dresses in a vulgar fashion and apparently spouts bigoted comments about various ethnic groups and homosexuals.Until last night, I had never heard of this individual, Christian Weston Chandler. I am very grateful to my friend Chelsea, author of the It's Tabi's time blog, for bringing this individual to my attention for two reasons.The first reason is that the celibacy that not uncommonly occurs amongst autistic males and the frustration it causes them is rarely written about on the internet or elsewhere. Readers of autism's gadfly know that I am one of the exceptions to this rule. Another exception to this rule is my friend David Miedzianik ,who long before Tom Mckean or individuals such as Stephen Shore and John Robison published their memoirs, who are barely affected by their autism if at all, was the sole male in the world to have written a memoir of any kind about his life's experiences with autism. In fact, at one time, he and Temple Grandin were the only persons so far as I know to have written about their life's experiences with autism and to have it published in any form. I have written about David elsewhere. I am also gratified to see that the torch has been passed to one of the younger generation of autistics, my friend 18-year-old Oliver Canby, author of the autism is bad blog. Unfortunately, Oliver, David and myself would seem to be the exceptions to the rule of helping to publicize this problem that I suspect neurodiversity proponents and others don't wish to discuss. Though it would seem that Christian is a profoundly troubled individual with a very serious disability, I suspect that part of his problem stems from an inability to get laid. His rejection by the opposite sex has apparently caused him to lash out at some others and possibly make inappropriate and untoward advances to some women.The second reason is that Chelsea's post and take on the matter shows a lot of what is wrong with neurodiversity given the ND point of view in general and Chelsea's point of view in particular. One of the tenets of neurodiversity is that autism is not a disorder that needs to be cured but a different way of being that needs acceptance and accommodation by society. Chelsea has been an active supporter of Ari Ne'eman and has applauded his appointment to the NDC and IACC. Ne'eman has written that social pleasantry should be eliminated as a criteria for hiring people for jobs and as something that should be used to evaluate someone's job performance. He makes this statement in spite of never actually having had a real job of any kind in his life. Chelsea, an 18-year-old with no life or work experience either, has expressed agreement with this. One would think that Chelsea would believe that if social unpleasantry should be tolerated in the workplace., that Mr. Chandler should be given a job, be able to sexually accost woman in his workplace, make bigoted statements and dress inappropriately on the job and still be able to keep his job and not have this be a criteria for evaluating his job performance that her attitudes would extend to Chandler's behavior outside of the workplace.Strangely enough, this does not seem to be the case she writes on her blog:This man is an embarrassment to the autistic community. He whines about his virginity at age 27. He dresses inappropriately in public (I mean in a potentially offensive way, not just unfashionable). Apparently he is a racist, sexist, and homophobe with no respect for human diversity. He is so desperate to have a girlfriend, that he will hunt down any BF-free girl he comes across on the internet or in real life. I am unsure of how this all came about. Most ignorant people would assume that it was his autism that caused it all, so the logical answer is to get rid of it (cure it).If autistics need acceptance and accommodation by society, why would Christian be an embarrassment? One would think Chelsea and her friends would have empathy for this individual and say that it is society's problem. If social unpleasantry should be tolerated in the workplace, then why not in friendships, internet communications and choosing a mate? I would think that Chelsea and the other female ND activists should be glad to hop in the sack with this guy and give him some happiness. I must be one of those ignorant people that is referred to in the blog post because I would suspect it is his autism, or whatever you want to call the defect in his brain that causes him to behave in this manner, of course exacerbated by the frustration his celibacy causes. Though there is currently no cure for Chandler's condition, I would assume that if there was one that this would be the ultimate solution and he would be happy to have one so that he could be a productive member of society and work and have a romantic relationship with a woman.The blog post ends on this note:So the point of this post is, I would like to know a practical solution to deal with people who display these unacceptable behaviors and have no desire to change them.In addition to being impressed by Chelsea's omniscience in knowing that Christian has no desire to change, I will concede that I don't have the solution for helping Mr. Chandler either. I wish I did. However, the ultimate goal (which does not exist) would be to cure Mr. Chandler of his autism, so he does not have these problems and does not have to go through life suffering as he does.Apparently, most ND's not only not want to help him if there were a cure available and demonize organizations such as autism speaks who want to find a cure for an individual like this, a good number of them apparently want to mock and ridicule this poor man rather than having empathy for him. To Chelsea's credit, she is not one of these people. Of course this is not the case with everyone. Some character who calls himself \"Nitz the bloody\" writes in the post's comments section:Okay, I'll admit to being a huge fan of the trolling of CWC,I looked at this person's profile and briefly looked at his blog and found out he was one of the attendees of autreat, that annual unsavory conclave of neurodiversity hatemongers. So we see instead of saying that Mr. Chandler needs acceptance we see that at least some people think it is okay to harass and mock and ridicule this individual.Neurodiverse logic will most likely never stop baffling me.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://cheetahchottah.blogspot.com/2010/07/my-thoughts-on-cwc.html", "http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Chris-chan", "http://www.autismisbad.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/07/neurodiversitys-interesting-take-on.html", "title": "\nneurodiversity's interesting take on Christian Weston Chandler\n"},
{"date": " August 12, 2010", "body": "\nOne of the many items in neurodiversity's bag of dirty tricks is to trivialize autism by alleging that various historical figures have autism or Asperger's syndrome. Therefore, they claim that these people can serve as role models and that anyone diagnosed on the spectrum has the potential to do just fine. Also, the argument against doing scientific research to find a cure for autism is supposedly bolstered by claiming we are depriving the world of the next Albert Einstein or Bill Gates.Most people who have read my writings know that about six years ago or so I wrote a fairly lengthy article (originally a book chapter in a book I was working on at one time) in which I attempted to debunk the diagnoses of autism for Bill Gates, Albert Einstein and Thomas Jefferson, three of neurodiversity's favorite role models.Nobel prize winning economist Vernon Smith is also lauded as an example of a spectrumite whose gifts allowed him to make great contributions to society. However, upon a less superficial examination, we find that Smith's basis for claiming he has Asperger's at age 78 came from a self-administered autism quotient test and no clinical diagnosis.Award winning mathematician Richard Borcherds is also touted by the neurodiversity ideologues of having Asperger's syndrome. We find that on further examination, the truth that the ND movement wishes to suppress is that Borcherds sought a diagnosis from psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen who would not give him one. Cohen wrote in book The essential difference:One might question whether Richard Borcherds really merits a diagnosis at all, given how well adapted he is. Certainly he is not currently severe enough in his symptoms to warrant a diagnosis in adulthood, as his symptoms are not interfering with his daily functioning. In the jargon of the diagnostic criteria, he is not \"suffering any impairment in his daily life\"........In my previous post, I discussed the autism speaks funded Talk TV video that was produced by Wrongplanet creator Alex Plank and Jack \"Cubby\" Robison. They interviewed Wired magazine writer Steve Silberman who stated that he was planning to write a book which in part would extol the gifts of the autistic spectrum to society. Two examples that Silberman used in the interview was the creation of Bram Cohen's computer program, Bittorrent which is a computer program that makes it easier to download large files and Craig Newmark's creation of the well known website Craig's list. Both of these individuals are given as examples of successful persons with Asperger's syndrome.In a private email to Mr. Silberman, I bemoaned the fact that my disability is often trivialized by stories such as these and I felt he should note this. In a nice reply to me he explained that he agreed autism could cause problems for those who have it and that I had a one-sided idea of the book he planned to write. When he felt I was implying in my last post that he had commercial motivations for granting his interview to Plank and Robison, he posted a comment on my blog claiming that was not the case and that the book had not even reached the proposal stage yet and that he was just beginning to do research on it.Well perhaps since he seems to plan using Cohen and Newmark as examples of persons on the spectrum who have made great contributions to society I'll try to be helpful to Mr. Silberman in doing his homework.According to an article in business week about Cohen's alleged Asperger's. He was someone who was able to go to college, get married and have a child and set up a very successful software venture. The notion that he has Asperger's syndrome came about when he was out with his girlfriend Jenna and Jenna's young daughter at a restaurant and they were talking about empathy and Cohen's lack of it. Jenna, who had worked with autistic children, suggested that Cohen have Asperger's syndrome. The article goes on to state that Cohen never sought a professional diagnosis of Asperger's.yet another article questions whether or not Cohen really does have Asperger's. Some of the commenters on this article take umbrage (as do I) that Cohen would trivialize ASD's by claiming that he has one without bothering to obtain a clinical diagnosis.Craig Newmark has also written about Asperger's However he just states the symptoms are familiar to him and he gives no indication that he was actually diagnosed or any evidence that he indeed has this condition. One of the most telling sentences:However, psychologist friends berate me when I indulge my (mostly suppressed) hypochondria in this area.It would seem that once again neurodiversity gets it wrong on two more of their role models. I also can't help thinking that after Mr. Silberman does some more research, his book may be shorter than he actually anticipated.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_43/b4105046863317_page_3.htm", "http://valleywag.gawker.com/5064890/bram-cohen-invokes-the-aspergers-defense", "http://www.cnewmark.com/2009/01/my-nerd-thing-and-aspergers-syndrome-.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/08/do-bram-cohen-and-craig-newmark-have.html", "title": "\nDo Bram Cohen and Craig Newmark have Asperger's?\n"},
{"date": " July 10, 2010", "body": "\nSome readers of autism's gadfly will remember some time ago I wrotea post about the locus coeruleus and autism. One of the readers and commenters of the post was a gentleman named Yuri Danilov, who gave me his phone number and signed his name and asked me to call him. I wrote down the phone number and deleted the comment. I was apprehensive. When I searched for this name in Google, I discovered that this person was a brain researcher and biophysicist in this neurologic rehabilitation department at the University of Wisconsin. I was flattered this pristine individual and scientist would take the time to read my humble blog and called him up.He told me that he believed he had found a very new and revolutionary treatment in autism that would greatly help ameliorate the symptoms of autism and he was looking for suitable research subjects. He had a thick Russian accent and I had a bit of trouble understanding everything he said. I asked him if this was a cure for autism (something as most readers of my blog know I long for). He replied that it was not a cure but a very revolutionary treatment but that nobody believed him. He asked me how old I was. I was 53 at the time. He claimed that was not necessarily too old to participate in this study, but I had the feeling he may have felt I was a bit older than the research subject he was looking for.Since I had never heard of him I was wondering if it was a coincidence that he happened to hold a faculty position at the same university as rogue neurodiversity researcher Morton Gernsbacher. I asked him if he was working with Gernsbacher. He replied that he did not work with Gernsbacher but he knew someone who had worked with her.I told him that I was hesitant to travel to Wisconsin unless I was compensated for it, at least had my travel and accommodations paid for. He told me that he had people come all the way from Australia to participate in his research studies.Since he had read my article on the locus coeruleus I wondered if his research was somehow related to this area of the brain which is the central location of the various tracts of axons that travel to various locations in the brain carrying the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. He just said that his research involved the brain stem. When I tried to pursue the matter further, he was rather tight lipped and just said that I could check out the lab's website and then email him if I had any further questions.As I read about him and his colleague, the late Dr. Paul Bach-y-Rita, I became fascinated and intrigued. They had developed a technique where blind people whose retinas had been damaged could put this device on their tongue which had electrode arrays and the senses through the tongue could enter the visual cortex and the blind person could end up seeing. Bach-y-Rita had stated you don't see with your eyes you see with the brain. Eyes are merely a vehicle that sense changes in light energy but it is the occipital cortex of the brain that perceives these energy changes and thus sees. The skin and the retina have in common they are both sensory receptors and that may be enough. Danilov was a biophysicist and neuroscientist who worked with Bach-y-Rita who passed away about four years ago. The tongue is considered an ideal entry point into the brain for sensory substitution because unlike skin on other areas of the body it generally has no insensitive layer of dead skin on it.The research that Danilov is also involved in addition to sensory substitution is neuromodulation, which involves stimulating the brain in various ways such as attention to a task, implanting electrodes in various areas of the brain to abort epileptic seizures, and the new cutting edge treatment transcranial magnetic stimulation which John Robison has been participating in. They are also using a revolutionary new technique called cranial nerve noninvasive neuromodulation, to help with neuroplasticity.I never heard back from Danilov and I seem to remember I sent him an email about something (don't remember exactly what) which he never answered. I won't rule out writing him again at some point.My recent track record as a research subject has been less than stellar. About 12 years ago Greg Allen was doing a study in the Courchesne lab involving fMRI. My head was too large to fit into the MRI scanner along with the computer equipment so I could not participate. I tried to have an MRI scan at Cal Tech in a study that Dan Kennedy was doing and for some reason the coil would not fit around my head or on my face. I wrote about this in a previous gadfly post. This is in contrast to my earlier experiences as a research subject where I underwent a couple of MRI scans that Eric Courchesne and I guess some other people who worked with him were doing. So even if I were provided airline ticket and hotel in Madison Wisconsin for a brief time I might not be of any use to Dr. Danilov either. One of the things I don't understand is how this stuff can be applied to autism where the etiology of the brain problems is still not very well understood. Of course I am not sure what Danilov and his people are doing and I guess I will have to wait to find out. I still wonder if there is any chance this treatment (albeit experimental) could help me and others on the spectrum. I find it interesting that Danilov stated that no one believed him. The people who treat autism with questionable non peer reviewed treatments such as chelation, hyperbaric oxygen, gluten free diets etc are believed and still have their adherents. Rimland's heir apparent, Steve Edelson, has been trying to bring back research into secretin in spite of study after study refuting its effectiveness. I guess I will never know and I will just have to wait and see what Danilov's research produces. At some point he will undoubtedly publish in peer reviewed journals if this research shows promise in treating ASD's. The media will likely pick up on this as he and Dr. Bach-y-Rita before he passed away have already received some media attention. It does not look like I am going to be a research subject for this lab let alone benefit from what may be a revolutionary autism treatment though. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_MEwMAXjBWv4/TDkJkaHH6PI/AAAAAAAAADY/2FU0TTT8-nQ/s1600/images%5B3%5D.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MEwMAXjBWv4/TDi5xkKa-II/AAAAAAAAADQ/nv_BzTaBlmM/s1600/images%5B3%5D.jpg", "http://tcnl.med.wisc.edu/home.php", "http://tcnl.med.wisc.edu/background_nm.php", "http://tcnl.med.wisc.edu/background_cnninm.php"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/07/could-yuri-danilov-help-me-and-other.html", "title": "\ncould Yuri Danilov help me and other ASD sufferers?\n"},
{"date": " August 13, 2010", "body": "\nIn my previous posts in the last few posts, I have wondered about why in the world an organization that claims they are funding research in the hopes of mitigating or possibly curing the horrible affliction called autism would fund videos done by Alex Plank. In fact, yesterday, I emailed Mr. Marc Sirkin who is apparently in charge of media matters for autism speaks, Peter Bell, vice-president of autism speaks who apparently has developed a friendship between Plank, Robison, Sr. and Robison, jr. and to the contact address for autism speaks itself, asking why they would fund such an endeavor.Though my email still remains unanswered by any of these three entities it seems that Mr. Sirkin has responded here. He gives what in Gadfly's view is a rather vague statement that somehow these videos are improving the dialogue among various members of the autism community and that a video that he prominently displays on the blog post in which an interview is conducted with a journalist of a major magazine which helps trivialize this disability and which the journalist for this magazine makes sweeping statements without bothering to do his homework and implies that the creation of a significant software company and the well-known Craig's list were due to attributes of the autism spectrum. He states that the financing of these videos are somehow helping in this mission to achieve the goal of addressing autism which he (unlike Alex Plank and other ND's) calls an \"urgent health crisis\". How any of these autism talk TV videos, particularly the latest one featuring the previously mentioned journalist are helping in this regard is unclear to gadfly. I am wondering how the headbanging, finger chewing nonverbal autistic children of certain parents who contributed money to autism speaks and participated in their walks are being helped by Plank's videos. Another salient point is that Sirkin makes is the panned (apparently macro) statement of Plank's that autism speaks is in no way influencing the content of the videos as if this has any significance or is relevant to anything. Of course Plank'ssinging a completely different tune and praising the organization which previously was anathema to him goes unmentioned in Sirkin's response.John Robison's interesting duties as member of scientific advisory board of ASAs most in the autism blogosphere know John Elder Robison has been appointed as a member of the scientific advisory board of autism speaks, his apparent sole qualification for this position being that he wrote a best selling memoir about his life with Asperger's syndrome. In his book Robison claimed that a cure for Asperger's was not needed He went further than saying that he desired no cure for himself but that also no cure was needed for anyone else with condition-the fact they might be too impaired to make $100K a year as an engineer, be successful business people in automechanic enterprises, be able to write memoirs that appeared in the New York Times bestseller lists was beside the point.Robison later claimed that this did not mean he did not care for others on the spectrum who happened to be less fortunate than he was. He claimed he was interested in reviewing scientific research proposals for autism speaks that would help in ameliorating the more disabling aspects of autism. The start of Robison's affiliation with AS was not propitious being he immediatelystuck his foot in his mouth implying that he might know more about what was best for autistic children than their own parents, which naturally Harold Doherty of the autism in New Brunswick blog and MJ of the autismjabberwocky blog took umbrage to.I have yet to see how Robison in his capacity so far with AS has contributed to the betterment of autistic person's lives or made constructive suggestions on which science should be funded or how science should be done by autism speaks which might make it possible to ameliorate some of the more disabling aspects of autism which he stated was his goal in spite of stating that a cure for at least some ASD's was not necessary for anyone at all in his book.It would seem however that based on Sirken's post and lame excuse for Plank and company that Robison has gone out of his scope in concentrating on the science of autism speaks and has instead chosen to spend more time pursuing media endeavors rather than science and in a case when his own son is one of the two principals involved. He apparently urged autism speaks to fund Alex Plank's endeavor which they agreed to do.I have left a comment on autism speaks blog. In case they mod it out and don't approve it. I will reproduce it here:Hello, Mr. Sirkin. The funding of autism speaks of this young man\u2019s media endeavors when he has libeled your organization, implying your main goal is to develop a prenatal test when there are severely autistic persons who bang their heads and can\u2019t speak. Others who are higher functioning such as myself who can\u2019t hold down a job is a slap in the face, to all of the good people who donated money to your organization and participated in your walks as a matter of blind faith, so that this horrible disability could be mitigated or possibly cured.No, Mr. Sirkin, your excuse does not cut it with me. If Peter Bell or anyone else from autism speaks responds to gadfly concerning this outrage, I will keep the readers updated.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/08/13/autismtalktv/#comment-5687", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/03/john-elder-robison-owes-parents-apology.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/08/marc-sirkins-lame-excuse-for-alex-plank.html", "title": "\nMarc Sirkin's lame excuse for Alex Plank\n"},

{"date": " August 19, 2010", "body": "\nI have just discovered a somewhat dated thread on the wrongplanet.net web page which has the slogan \"autism=good\" in the title bar of the browser when one logs onto this stellar website.It goes on with the members of wrongplanet questioning why Alex Plank would go hat in hand to autism speaks, an organization who has described autism as a global health crisis and clearly does not share the \"autism is good\" philosophy of WP, why Alex Plank and his friend Jack \"Cubby\" Robison would solicit (and be given) funding by AS for their autism talk TV show.John Robison has some choice words in defense of Alex Plank and his son Jack:My joining the Autism Speaks science board was a gamble. I know many of you criticized me, but I believe I am succeeding in what I set out to do. I am able to advocate for research that helps people on the spectrum, and I can speak against research I oppose. Any of you, of course, can do the same thing, but I can do so as an insider, where my vote counts. Yours doesn't. At least not yet.Gadfly wonders what it is that Robison set out to do. He certainly succeeded in getting autism speaks to donate to a cause that involved his own son for a very questionable activity and a very questionable organization which would, at least on the surface not share the philosophy of AS and the relatives of autistic children who donated money and went on walks who most likely would not agree with wrong planet's \"autism=good\" message. If he has made contributions in the scientific realm, he has neglected to write about it on his blog or anywhere else that I know of.Robison ends with a statement that in my opinion would make Marie Antoinette and her \"let them eat cake\" statement seem philantrophic by comparison:In my opinion, this whole tempest over a few thousand dollars of underwriting support is just ridiculous. If Autism Speaks is so bad, do you want to pony up the money to fund Autism Talk TV instead? Alex would not need sponsors if you guys were donorsOf course one wonders if Robison feels this way and it is just a few thousand dollars why a successful businessman and a best selling memoirist could not have ponied up the cash himself, particularly when his own son is one of the two principals. The answer of whether or not he contributed follows. Certain posters on wrong planet correctly pointed out to Robison that they were on disability, living in poverty and did not have the money to contribute.Robison writes:So why attack Alex over this?Why attack Autism Speaks for a gesture that brings something interesting and useful to our community?First of all, it is only Robison's opinion that these videos are useful or even interesting in any manner, except that they show how corrupt and unethical both autism speaks and the neurodiversity movement are. I certainly do not share Robison's opinion.Why attack Alex? Because, Alex has done nothing but criticize autism speaks. He has a certain constituency on wrongplanet that have donated money to the website who don't like autism speaks. He has libeled the organization by implying they are deliberately trying to develop a prenatal test to abort autistic fetuses. He libeled them by printing the false story that Zach Lassiter's t-shirt business was closed down by autism speaks using intimidation tactics. Then later goes on to make flattering statements about AS that have no factual basis coincidentally right after he received funding from this organization that he clearly despises and forsook his principles over.I attack autism speaks, because they have parents who have children who will never function the way Robison or Plank do and they participated in walks in good faith believing the money would be funded to do something to help their kids function better rather than having a person who has a slogan autism=good travelling around the country at their expense making videos which so far only seem to extol the virtues of autism and do nothing to present the uglier side.Robison continues:We're studying new therapies to help adults with social skills, and many other things. We have some really exciting work going to help autistic people who have severe speech difficulties. You can read about all that on my blogs.I can't really recall Robison ever writing anything about this on his \"look me in the eye\" blog. If anyone can point to me where he has ever written anything about his work with autism speaks which entails studying social skills or speech therapy for autistics or any science I would be interested in knowing about it.So far autism talk tv has aired seven videos, it is only on the last two or so that we see the oil and water mix of autism speaks and wrong planet logos on the credits. But apparently Robison has partially picked up the tab for at least the first few videos:I paid for them to go with my personal funds, so if anything, I personally sponsored those first videos but we did not say that when we put the credits together. Autism Speaks will reimburse some of my costs with their underwriting grant.So we see that Robison did have the ability to pay for his son's( and son's friend's) extracurricular activities. Yet, after accepting an unpaid position on the board of autistic speaks, after making scads of money in successful businesses and having a book on the new york times best seller list and likely being paid at least a six figure advance for his forthcoming book, he then goes hat in hand and accepts money from this organization for his own personal use. The words cronyism and conflict of interest come to mind.Though I have had many differences with \"Socrates\" of the new republic blog. He makes some valid points that perhaps Plank and Robison, junior could add episodes of kids in special education schools or very low functioning kids in group homes in one of their autism talk tv episodes. I will await with bated breath to see if these two kids will do anything in their autism speaks subsidized activities that does not have an \"autism is beautiful\" message behind it.So we see that autism speaks is an organization that funds scientists with a neurodiversity perspective who claim autism is harmless, they fund a public relations campaign showing how great it is to employ autistic people yet, don't have one paid employee with autism in their organization and have never contributed to the employment of a single person on the spectrum as far as I know, they fund the insurance reform efforts in various states, running public service announcements claiming this work is the difference between autistic children having friends and not having friends and neglect to provide any evidence that this is the case. It is this blogger's opinion that the funding of autism talk tv and giving John Robison free money is possibly an all time low.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt134097.html", "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cronyism", "http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-conflict-of-interest.htm", "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cronyism"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/08/autism-talk-tv-saga-gets-uglier.html", "title": "\nautism talk tv: the saga gets uglier\n"},
{"date": " August 22, 2010", "body": "\nI still remember at one of the autism society of america conferences I attended, I met with a representative from the autism tissue program, which is a program affiliated with that Microsoft of autism research, autism speaks,that collects postmortem brains of autistic persons for analysis.I signed some paperwork, gladly donating my brain to science in the event of my inevitable passing, whenever that would be. They also gave me a stickie to decorate my refrigerator, which is still a prominent ornament I see everytime I get some food out.To date, genetic studies have been of limited value in clarifying the etiology of autism. The genotypes which can lead to similar though not necessarily identical phenotypes are probably too heterogeneous and the sample sizes that can be obtained to date have not been large enough to show many unifying genetic etiologies. For obvious reasons, there are no really good animal models of autism, though research similar to the type Harry Harlow did on rhesus monkeys might produce such a model if a scientist ever wants to pursue that line of work. Also Jocelyne Bachevalier has done some interesting work on lesioning the amygdala and possibly other parts of the limbic system in monkeys for a putative animal model of autism, but there are also obvious inherent limitations in this work. MRI scans and fMRI scans are also most likely quite limited in what they can tell us about anomalies in autistic brains.Autopsies might be our ace in the hole for being able to get to the bottom of the underlying causes of autism and help in finding more advanced treatments, prevention or even a cure. One problem with this is that autistic persons live out their natural lives and the oldest persons diagnosed with autism might be like 75 years old now (though I suppose an older person could be diagnosed retrospectively), so there is a dearth of available brains. For this reason probably not much more than a few dozen autistic brains have been autopsied. I wrote an essay arguing that we needed to locate autism's so called \"hidden horde\" if possible so we could have as many post mortem brains available for autopsy as possible. Of course the problem with so many different types of \"autism\" being out there, even if we could get more brains they might not provide elucidation on the etiology. If enough brains were obtained, though we might get a general idea of what was wrong in a significant subset of at least some autistic persons.Though of late i have been lax in reading more of the recent literature in autism, many years ago I did read the studies with the first autopsy reports in autism including a study by Williams et al which did not find abnormalities in four brains, but did allude to some cerebellar problems in at least a couple of the autistic brains. Then came the study at UCLA by Ritvo et. al. who found reduced Purkinje cell counts in the cerebella of some deceased autistics. They only looked for Purkinje cells and did not look for granule cells or other types of neurons which may have limited the studies potential for usefulness. Last but certainly not least I read the studies by Bauman and Kemper showing the various problems with the cerebellum and limbic systems in autism. Later, I seem to recall that David Amaral of the MIND institute did some studies of postmortem autistic brains that showed differences in the amygdalas between autistics and normal controls (no offense intended Larry Arnold).About 9 years ago, Margaret Bauman was in town and gave a lecture to our support group. I knew that because of new techniques developed that the etiology of Parkinson's disease had been discovered, damage to the nigrostriatal bundle, the main dopaminergic pathway of the brain. I asked her if enough brains were available for autopsy in autism if some day we might have the same understanding of autism's etiology as exists in Parkinson's. She seemed to believe that the answer was yes.Later I worried about how autism speaks would be able to obtain my brain when I passed away. Though my parents are both still living, the likelihood I will outlive them is not low. I don't have a terribly close relationship with my sister who lives about a thousand miles away from me. So, who would know that I willed my brain to science and that it would be imperative to get it out of my skull and preserve it in formaldehyde so it won't spoil immediately. I knew that though I had good intentions, I might never be able to carry them out posthumously. Of course one thing I did not have to worry about is having my feelings hurt if Socrates or some other members of the neuroperversity (a tip of the gadfly hat to Billy \"Lurker\" Cresp for that term) movement called me a traitor and a \"house aspie\" for having the temerity to donate my brain to an autism speaks affiliated project, as I would be dead and it would not matter.Slowly I started to become disillusioned with AS.I learned that they donated half a million dollars to a rogue scientist who stated that their goal of curing autism was nonsensical and also stated that autism was not harmful and was not a disorder but merely a difference.They implied their insurance lobbying would make a difference between autistic children having friends and not having friends without providing any proof.They put on a dog and pony show talking about how important it was to employ autistic persons yet did not employ a single autistic person in their organization or do anything to actually help a person with autism find a job.Last but certainly not least it would seem AS engages in cronyism.I was a bit distressed about the logistical problems of autism speaks being able to get my postmortem brain, but maybe it does not matter after all.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismtissueprogram.org/site/c.nlKUL7MQIsG/b.5183271/k.BD86/Home.htm", "http://www.psychology.emory.edu/nab/bachevalier/index.html", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/hidden-horde.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/08/will-autism-speaks-get-my-brain.html", "title": "\nWill autism speaks get my brain?\n"},

{"date": " September 1, 2010", "body": "\nWe see, that the well known person, Darius McCollum, who is obsessed with trains and has a propensity to steal them has been busted yet again. McCollum has alleged that he has Asperger's syndrome. As a boy, he was obsessed by trains, particularly the New York transit system. He would hang out with the New York MTA workers who took a liking to him and showed him the ropes and ended up knowing more about the system than anyone else. But he had a compulsion to take the subway trains for joy rides and though he knew what he was doing was wrong. He has been arrested now 27 times in the last three decades, so averaging close to one arrest per year. Apparently, not being able to find a train, he took a bus for a joyride.Personally, I am skeptical that McCollum actually has any sort of ASD. He was able to get married (though now divorced or separated) and the fact that he was able to relate to the NYC MTA employees and they took a liking to him makes his diagnosis suspect at least to me. There is no question, however, he has some very severe OCD issues. I feel, however, that his circumstances are highly relevant to the thrust of this blog, as I will point out below.when McCollum was arrested last, autism's gadfly gave his take on the matterI inquired as to whether the neurodiversity movement would actually give a shit about this person. \"Jypsy\" pointed out to me that there had been some effort to assist Mr. McCollum and she had personally been involved in these matters with the persons who were interested and were trying to help defray some of his legal costs. I found the relevant info online and I emailed the people who were involved to get their take. They were happy that I took an interest and told me McCollum was in North Carolina, staying at his mother's and gave me his phone number. Intrigued I called the number and a person alleging to be McCollum answered the phone and we chatted for a bit. He told me he had tried very hard to stop his compulsion and had taken various SSRI medications used to treat OCD issues but nothing had helped. He seemed resigned to the fact that this was a lifelong issue and there was nothing he could do.His lawyers tried to use Asperger's as a legal defense without success.I was still in correspondence with Ari Ne'eman back a couple of years ago and asked him if ASAN was planning to do anything to help McCollum and he stated that McCollum was not an issue they were pursuing.This was before I had read Ne'eman's interesting essay where he talks about how curing autism would be morally reprehensible and he was claiming that autism should never be used as a defense against criminal behavior under any circumstance. In spite of this fact, Ne'eman later claimed that Zaqhuery Price, who assaulted some teachers in a special ed school should have the charges against him dropped.When I pointed out these inconsistencies in my post, various members of the ND community pointed out to me because this was an 11-year-old boy and the teachers somehow were to blame because they did not accommodate his disability properly that this should be some sort of exception to Ne'eman's rule.I wonder how they feel about McCollum, a 45-year-old man, particularly in light of the fact that he may have an ASD (assuming gadfly's skepticism is incorrect). Would Ari Ne'eman and Socrates throw the book at this guy and lock him up in a cell and throw away the key? Would they claim that curing McCollum of his compulsion would be morally reprehensible and that he should go on stealing trains, yet say that he should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law? Or would ASAN and ND claim that this behavior should be accepted? Or would they claim that society had somehow failed to accommodate McCollum and that if society learned how to utilize the strengths of autistics and ended discrimination against autistics, then McCollum would not steal trains? Inquiring minds want to know.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/01/2010-09-01_darius_busted_again.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/09/darius-mccollum-arrested-yet-again.html", "title": "\nDarius McCollum arrested yet again\n"},
{"date": " September 20, 2010", "body": "\nA controversy at one time extant in the autism blogosphere was the lack of autistic representation in the leadership of that well known organization autism speaks. Recently best selling memoirist, John Elder Robison was appointed to a scientific advisory board of AS. He has expressed an interest in scientific research that will help mitigate the problems of autism spectrum disorders.For a while, it would seem that Robison was more interested in garnering AS funds for his own personal use than he was in reviewing science or suggesting ways that persons on the spectrum could be helped by science.As of recently this seems to have changed. Robison has apparently been attempting to make a couple of suggestions for directions into which autism science should go. One of the interesting ones is to study geek success. Why would Bill Gates be able to become a billionaire in spite of having autism or autistic traits and why would college professors like Vernon Smith and Richard Borcherds have success in spite of being on the spectrum. when other persons with similar traits are on social security disability? Robison's brilliant suggestion is to study these traits and see how they can be applied to persons less fortunate. The criteria for specifying whether these persons are autistic is Simon Baron-Cohen's AQ test.Though Robison mentions Bill Gates he neglects to mention any other specific examples of autism success stories. I believe that I have debunked the notion of Bill Gates' autism in my undiagnosing essay which Robison has apparently never read, so I won't go into this further. I am sure the interested reader can find my essay and read the section on Gates and judge for themselves.One of the problems Robison neglects to mention about the AQ test, is that it is a self-administered test meant for adults with normal or above average intelligence. Not for persons with intellectual disabilities. (Though recently newer versions have been devised for children but it is different than the adult test) As far as I know, it has never been standardized in any way and just an informal test. It is also not something meant for a legitimate clinical diagnosis which even Baron-Cohen himself has acknowledged. Professor Vernon Smith who neurodiversity proponents (and perhaps Robison) give as an example of an accomplished ASD'er just decided at age 78, based on this self-administered test that he was on the spectrum without bothering to get any kind of diagnosis.Richard Borcherds is another example mentioned, here is what Baron-Cohen stated in his book The essential difference on the alleged AS:One might question whether Richard Borcherds really merits a diagnosis at all, given how well adapted he is. Certainly he is not currently severe enough in his symptoms to warrant a diagnosis in adulthood, as his symptoms are not interfering with his daily functioning. In the jargon of the diagnostic criteria, he is not \"suffering any impairment in his daily life\"........Of course, perhaps Robison and his friends (like Alex Plank) in the ND movement can actually find a legitimate geek success who is on the spectrum. All we have to do is isolate that person and find out what makes them so successful, then we can find out what went wrong in the non-geek who is on social security disability and not making a six or seven figure income as a computer scientist or college professor. This can be done in intellectually impaired autistics who can't speak as well. After all, they have more in common with Bill Gates, Vernon Smith and Richard Borcherds and perhaps some geek who legitimately has an ASD than they realize. Wow, what a major breakthrough that will be. Instead of being handicapped all autistic people will have this potential to be successful because of these traits.I can't wait for Robison's next brilliant suggestion.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://jerobison.blogspot.com/2010/09/shopping-for-autism-research.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Spectrum_Quotient"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/09/john-robison-wants-to-study-geek.html", "title": "\nJohn Robison wants to study \"geek success\"\n"},
{"date": " October 17, 2010", "body": "\nIn a newly breaking story Nick Dubin, a clinical psychologist allegedly diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome has been arrested for online child pornography of children having sex acts with adults!As regular readers of autism's gadfly will remember, Dr. Dubin,wrote a favorable article about the ND movement Dr. Dubin, praised GRASP president Michael John Carley, who has insulted severely autistic persons by saying he does not want to be associated with head bangers and diaper wearers.What is frightening is that Dubin is a licensed psychologist who up until now, worked with and had access to children. ironically enough, he specialized in the issues of bullying and autism. He has admitted to authorities that he knew the material on his computer was illegal. Dubin has been charged and is out on bail. In the meantime, pending the outcome of his trial, he has been barred from using a computer or having contact with minor children.Dubin, who claims to have an ASD, yet was not diagnosed until age 27 has written about neurodiversity:In theory, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a chink in the armor of neurodiversity\u2019s philosophy. Who would argue with the notion that society should take responsibility for how it treats some of its most vulnerable but creative citizens? Or that people with autism have inherent gifts and should be respected by others?Well perhaps one chink is that there is credible evidence that at least one of its adherents is a pedophile, very possibly not above actually having sexual encounters with small children. I realize that Dr. Dubin has not been charged with an actual sex act and as far as his charge on possession of online child porn, he is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. However, this story does indeed give food for thought and perhaps one could rethink the neurodiversity movement and the apparently ever increasing unsavoriness of its adherents.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.examiner.com/autism-parenting-in-chicago/doctor-with-autism-arrested-for-online-porn"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/10/neurodiversity-activist-busted-for.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity activist busted for child porn!\n"},
{"date": " August 25, 2010", "body": "\nAs regular readers of autism's gadfly know, the neurodiversity movement in general and the autistic self advocacy network in particular are full of dirty tricks such as playing the murder card. The internet, however, gives a dirty trickster the opportunity to play their tricks, using multiple identities and pretending to be other people.I have just read an interesting post on the midnight in Chicago blog concerning three well known female neurodiversity activists. I believe this post deserves a shout out on autism's gadfly as there is apparently some controversy that these individuals could be an actual holy trinity of one person.The post describes Meg Evans, a well known neurodiversity activist who is an attorney, married to a man named Brian K. White with two children, lives in Ohio and works in the publishing industry. She is the secretary of ASAN, just below Ari Ne'eman and Scott Robertson in chain of command.The post also talks about another female neurodiversity activist named Bonnie Ventura who also goes by the moniker Ventura 33 and has been a moderator of Aspies for Freedom and has a fan fiction site where stories are published by various authors and are given a star trek bent. She also has a website named Aspergerian pride. I gave Ms. Ventura consent to publish one of my stories, but more about that later.By a strange coincidence Bonnie Ventura has a few things in common with Ms. Evans. She also is married and has two children and lives in Ohio, and works in the publishing industry. Like Ms. Evans she was considered to be autistic early in her childhood. Of course coincidences do happen.The author of the blog post goes on to claim that web pages that Bonnie Ventura hosts have as their registered owner a Meg Evans. More interesting is that Meg Evans' husband, Brian White has a webpage foxfire74.com which has a link about his wife, Meg. On Meg's page, she states you can check out her fanfiction site and then it gives a link that goes directly to Bonnie Ventura's site. It would appear indeed that Meg Evans and Bonnie Ventura are in fact the same person, if not, there is a very strange coincidence.Many are also familiar with the rumor that the identity of apparently retired neurodiversity blogger \"the autistic bitch from hell\" is in fact Meg Evans. Allegedly the autistic bitch from hell wrote a post on one of Kim Womble's blogs and inadvertently signed her name Meg Evans, though I have never seen irrefutable documentation for such.So, it would seem there is a strong possibility that we do in fact have a holy trinity, Meg Evans, Bonnie Ventura, and the \"autistic bitch from hell\" being the same individual.The \"autistic bitch from hell\" has, in the past, made rather controversial statements first alleging that the only thing on Autism Speaks' agenda was finding a prenatal test so that autistic fetuses could be aborted. Also, she once stated that autistics who don't happen to agree with her on certain things should be taken out and shot or strangled to death and turned into cat food.The reason this blog post interested me so much is that I had some positive experiences with Bonnie Ventura more than two and a half years ago, just before I started this blog. Before I started autism's gadfly I wrote an article which I posted on my previous blog, Jonathan's Journal, urging individuals to reject neurodiversity. Later I modified this piece somewhat and put it as one of 9 articles in the nonfiction section of my website. Someone calling himself \"Robert Montgomery\" alleged in a comment on Harold Doherty's blog that I was a fraud because I could not have gone to a special education school in the 1960s, as there was no special education until the education for all handicapped act was passed in 1975 and made the strong statement about me that like all \"house autistics\" I lied about my past. I was able to document my former alma mater had been established in 1948, making him eat his words.Not long after this I got an email from a Ventura 33 stating that she had grown up in Los Angeles in the 1960s and had problems with elopement in her regular education school and that there was some talk in fact of a special education placement for her and recommending such to her parents, though like probably the majority of NDs, she never attended a special education school. She stated because of this she believed me and I should not pay attention to a \"loud mouth\" like Robert Montgomery and that I should not judge all persons in the ND movement just by persons like him. She also asked if she could publish my short story \"Mr. Twiddle\" which she had enjoyed on her web page and sort of modify it into a star trek type genre. I consented.I probably would not have consented now in light of the evidence that I have seen that Bonnie Ventura may in fact be \"the autistic bitch from hell\". Are all these three people the same individual. I don't know for sure, but there are some strange coincidences. Of course, as I said before, this was particularly interesting based on the experiences I had with Ventura33 in the past.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://midnightinchicago.wordpress.com/2010/08/25/megs-of-info-on-ventura-highway/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/08/three-identities-for-female.html", "title": "\nthree identities for female neurodiversity activist?\n"},

Unfortunately, I was trying to add some more quotes to the quotes section on the home page of the blog and adjust the spacing and somehow I pushed all my stuff down to the bottom of the page. Upon looking at the code, I noted that there were an excessive amount of break statements which added a zillion extra lines and I did not save a template of the original blog. I inquired on blogger's help section as how to access the html in my blog and found out.Unfortunately, when I click design and edit html only a CSS file loads and not the file containing the HTML code of this blog, even after clicking in the box expand widget templates the file will not load for some reason. Therefore I can't change it back. Otherwise I could go in and edit the file and resolve this problem. Also, on the WYSIWYG editing page, there seems to be no way to place the side bars to the right. I apologize for any inconvenience to anyone who may want to find and access the archives on this blog, but I guess you will have to scroll to the bottom of the page until I can find a way to solve this problem. Any suggestions in comments or email as to how I can solve the problem are appreciated.Senator Barbara Boxer ,who has been one of the two senators in my state since 1993, has declared victory in her race against Carly Fiorina and is claiming re-election to a fourth term. However, Fiorina has refused to concede the race saying that a margin of a few thousand votes or so is too close to call. Gadfly would agree with this; however, the left leaning media have declared Barbara Boxer the winner. I voted for Fiorina as I saw it as a vote against Ari Ne'eman's confirmation to the NDC which Boxer was a part of. Also a vote against federal funding of Morton \"autism is harmless\" Gernsbacher's research.Many members of the neurodiversity community seem to have very liberal political beliefs from what I have read in their blogs. However, one would think they would be enamored of Ms. Fiorina who has stated her desire to overturn Roe vs. Wade and her opposition to abortions except in cases of rape, incest and endangerment of the mother's life. If this happened, the ND argument that autism speaks and other groups seeking a cure for autism's goal of trying to find a way to deliberately abort autistic fetuses would become almost completely moot (excepting the illegal coat hanger abortions that occurred prior to Roe V. Wade). They would not be able to cry about eugenics. Even though we could still have illegal abortions, it might be much harder to obtain genetic testing for fetuses if all that could be done was to abort it. Somehow I suspect most californian ND's supported Boxer due to her appointment of Ne'eman and her liberalism. I also suspect most female ND's of child bearing age believe they have a right to an abortion as a form of birth control. However, they would not give the same right to a mother of an autistic fetus. With the exception of Frank Klein who stated he was for legalized abortion of non-autistic fetuses, I have yet to hear an ND comment on where they stand on the issue concerning nonautistics. I suspect most of them value the child's disability over the child's humanity. I suppose I could have voted for a libertarian or green or other minor party candidate against Boxer, but Fiorina had the greatest chance of winning. If the media or anyone else declares Boxer the winner hopefully Ms. Fiorina will demand a recount against such a narrow margin.It is my belief that a vote for any politician who would support Ari Ne'eman being able to craft autism policy at taxpayer expense and would support the research of neurodiversity rogue Morton Gernsbacher is a vote for children becoming crippled and sick, not being able to speak, and being in danger of accidentally drowning or running out in traffic and being hit by a car and being killed. Therefore I will await 2012 where all those who feel as I do will cast their vote for any candidate besides Obama or any other incumbent senator who voted to confirm Ne'eman.Addendum: The latest word is that Fiorina has conceded the election to Boxer\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2010/11/fiorina-concedes-defeat-in-senate-race-.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/11/problems-with-my-blog-and-senator.html", "title": "\nproblems with my blog and \"senator Fiorina\"\n"},
{"date": " October 22, 2010", "body": "\nNick Dubin's arrest for a pedophilia-related crime has generated a significant amount of buzz in some parts of the autism blogosphere as well as on various facebook pages of some persons with whom I am acquainted with, who, to the best of my knowledge, don't have blogger type blogs that they write.I have been told repeatedly by various individuals who advocate a certain movement called \"neurodiversity\" that this movement is about dignity, respect and human rights for persons with autism (and perhaps other 'neurologic differences'). One Michelle Dawson is in the forefront of this. In fact, at the time, I first started writing autism's gadfly as well as my article 'neurodiversity just say no' that was the immediate predecessor and greatest influence of my decision to start this blog, Michelle Dawson has stated that because I was an opponent of neurodiversity this meant I was an opponent of human rights for autistic persons.Ari Ne'eman and ASAN have stated that their autism advocacy is about civil and human rights for autistic persons. Yet they seem to devote most of their time demonstrating against Autism speaks or Ari Ne'eman making insulting and juvenile comments in his role as the newest public member of the IACC.One of the leading neurodiversity blogs is the well-known left brain/right brain blog whose posts are authored by Kevin Leitch and another individual who calls themselves \"Sullivan\". This blog seems to devote nearly all of their posts to the question of whether or not vaccines and/or mercury cause autism, an issue that has been dealt upon ad nauseum, with neither side brooking any quarters in their beliefs.Kim Wombles is an individual that writes the countering age of autism blog and seems to get some sort of bizarre humor posing as some elderly hick Appalachian woman as an alter ego in another blog she authors. In spite of claiming that she believes that persons should be treated with dignity and respect she has referred to Harold Doherty as \"an asshat\". She condescendingly referred to Jake Crosby as \"the puppy\" because of his youthful age. Last but not least, she was nice enough to give your humble blogger a plug on one of her facebook pages where she seemed to think it was funny that someone would make fun of me and my disability and also seems to have some sort of schaudenfreude as far as my disability and celibacy are concerned.We now have evidence that it is quite probable that Dr. Dubin, a psychologist and educator who had regular contact with autistic children, is a pedophile. There is also a strong possibility that the reason Dr. Dubin chose his profession is that he was looking for children to molest and chose disabled ones as they are the most vulnerable, many of them not able to speak and report what happened to their parents or others or because of prejudice they would not have credibility making allegations against the good doctor.Outside of the right not to be murdered, it would seem the right of disabled children not to be sexually molested would be about the most important of human rights that these august individuals would be crusading for. You would think that they would comment on this latest news story.Reading Michelle Dawson's TMOB comment board on a regular basis as well as her blog posts, I see no comment by this crusader for human rights of autistic persons. ASAN is also strangely silent. Ari Ne'eman is not organizing some sort of protest against professionals who evidence suggests are pedophiles and trying to protect autistic children from them the way he does with autism speaks. Kevin Leitch, \"Sullivan\" and Kim Wombles seem to have no comment on the issue. I wonder why that is.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/08/ari-neeman-at-iacc-meeting.html", "http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=91368243169&topic=10524"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/10/no-comment-ari-michelle-kev-sullivan.html", "title": "\nNo comment, Ari, Michelle, Kev, Sullivan and Kim?\n"},

{"date": " February 22, 2010", "body": "\nI see that lead neurodiversity proponent and ASAN president Ari Ne'eman has published a new essay One which the autism society of america newsletter the advocate solicited and then apparently rejected for some reason. Ne'eman starts out by saying that autistics have not been consulted on matters pertaining to autism. This is in spite of Stephen Shore's appointment to the IACC as well as his involvement (and John Robison's as well) in reviewing research grants. As well as Ne'eman being allowed to testify before the IACC when he was one of the people who protested the combating autism act out of which it grew. Ne'eman writes:The object of autism advocacy should not be a world without autistic people \u2014 it should be a world in which autistic people can enjoy the same rights, opportunities and quality of life as any of our neurotypical peers.As far as I know Ne'eman has not elaborated on what those rights are and on how they can be achieved without curation. There is no way that an autistic person can have a better quality of life without the medical intervention which currently does not exist and that research funding is attempting to find that Ne'eman wants eliminated.Ne'eman then gives his take on Lovaas and ABA:Even a cursory glance at the magazine of the Autism Society of America reveals many such examples, with advertisements for vaccine recovery and Applied Behavioral Analysis, whose initial aversive-heavy experiments claimed to bring half of all children subjected to its methods to \"indistinguishability from peers.\" These programs lack the research foundation they claim. For example, Ivar Lovaas' promise of recovery through ABA was based on the theory and methods used with \"feminine boys\" at-risk for homosexuality (Rekers & Lovaas 1974). That fact alone should give anyone pause. Meanwhile, those who peddle these pseudo-scientific treatments collect hundreds of thousands of un-reimbursable dollars from families justifiably desperate for a way to secure opportunities for their childrenIt seems strange for him to say this now in light of the fact that ASAN has been a proponent for \"positive behavior supports\" This is in spite of the fact that Lovaas' provides no evidence for efficacy of positive behavioral supports and was not able to get any of his published results without aversives.Ne'eman and ASAN have also been advocates for full funding of the IDEA, which in large part, as far as autistic children are concerned, ABA is one of the predominant treatments that parents seek funding for under this law and the bulk of litigation against school districts entails parents attempting to pay for these therapies.For anyone who regularly reads Michelle Dawson's TMOB comment board it would appear that Dawson and ASAN are at loggerheads over statements that Dawson has made that were critical of ABA.Next Ne'eman goes on with the old fear mongering neurodiversity lie about genetic research leading to abortions:What do we really want? Is it autism prevention? Given that research has shown that the autism spectrum is predominantly genetic in origin, the most likely form of prevention would be that of eugenic abortion, similar to what we have seen with the 92 percent rate of selective abortion in the Down syndrome community (Mansfield, et. Al. 1998)It should not be necessary to comment on the apples and oranges comparison of autism and Down's syndrome but here goes anyhow. Down's syndrome involves an abnormality in one chromosome. The genetic etiologies of the multitude of phenotypes which are termed autism are quite varied and many different abnormalities on genes and chromosomes have been found. There is also the fact that interactions with the environment cause these as well so a prenatal test for autism is not likely on the horizon for a long time. By the time enough about the genetics of autism is thoroughly understand well enough to abort an autistic fetus it is very possible that the DNA could actually be altered so that the child will be typical rather than be sick and crippled by autism. Down's syndrome (at least at one time) was a very different condition from autism, with the chance of them being much more severely impaired than many with autism, also a propensity to develop congenital heart problems and die very early. The study (Mansfield) that Ne'eman cites only reports on various papers that show rates of pregnancy terminations in the 1980s and 1990s. Ne'eman offers no evidence that Down's fetuses are still aborted at the same rates.Most interesting of all is that many ND's are politically left of center such as Obama supporter autistic bitch from hell. My chronic adversary and harasser Clay Adams seems to have left of center politics. There are probably many other examples. It is likely these individuals support Roe vs. Wade and would have no qualms about allowing a parent to abort a fetus that was conceived due to improper birth control or parents who just happened to change their mind and not want a child. It would seem members of neurodiversity value a child's disability over his humanity.Ne'eman talks about giving autistics a chance to hold down a job, but naturally offers no solutions, other than claiming there is an alternative to finding a cure or doing scientific research to find better treatments. His solutions are to say social unpleasantries should be overlooked in the workplace but how realistic is that? Like Clay says, wish in one hand shit in the other and see which one fills up first.Ne'eman goes on to cite a study which shows that autistic people when making monetary decisions involving risk are less likely to be affected by risk and certain social cues. Ne'eman shouts this study out as showing that autistics have strengths that can be capitalized upon in real world situations. However, he neglects to mention that these were high functioning autistics who were matched with normal controls on IQs whose intelligence was well above average (verbal IQ 112, performance IQ 109). These persons also had similar v IQ's and p IQ's unlike the 40 point discrepancy in myself and possibly discrepancies in many other individuals. Can we really assume the results of this study can be applied to all autistics as Ne'eman implies.Also, what Ne'eman neglects to mention is that though the results of this study suggested that the autistic subjects might be less influenced by question framing biases and had more attention to detail that there was a flip-side. That also it suggested impaired emotions and impaired ability to deal with social situations. So in reality the autistic strengths were offset by the autism weaknesses which, assuming this study could be applied to any real world phenomenon, that it would produce a zero sum result in terms of autistic functioning. Ne'eman only mentions the authors findings of strengths in the study but neglects to note the autistic weaknesses that the study demonstrated.The old neurodiversity line about autistics being able to do just fine without a cure is extolled:The oft-cited concept of \"recovery\" from autism is not only scientifically unsupported but also dangerous in that it removes the very supports that made progress possible for many people with autism. Moreover, by equating developmental progress with a change in the fundamental character of our brains, the recovery concept denies the natural growth and skill acquisition that occurs for all individuals, regardless of disability. It is unreasonable to assume that autistics will be the same at age 30 as at age 3.No I was not the same at age 30 as age 3. However, at age 30 I still had very bad impairments( which I still have at age 54). Of course this excludes people like John Belmonte over the age 30 and unable to talk or Sean Lapin or Noah Greenfeld, both well over the age of 30 and nonverbal severely autistic with Noah being under institutional care.Ne'eman then spits out the old neurodiversity bullcrap about how none of us are independent in that we don't hunt for our own food or build our own homes etc. However, there is a difference between dependence and interdependence. In interdependence the lawyer who can't build his own home or hunt his food makes money so that he can pay for these without the aid of the state.  The home builder who needs a lawyer pays a lot of money taking Abe Lincoln's old advice about a fool for a client.  This is different than autistics who collect SSI being dependent on the state.  So basically Ne'eman is saying it is just fine that autistics are impaired and can't do for themselves, not the mention of the humiliation of having to be dependent on parents or on the state, etc.Ne'eman goes on to speak about his position on whether or not autism is a disability:It should be stressed: none of this is meant to deny the very real fact that autism is a disability. It is only to point out that disability is as much a social as a medical phenomenon and that the \"cure\" approach is not the best way forward for securing people's quality of life.Certainly a different statement from his previous \"difference is not disability\" statement that he wrote in a previous essay which was later edited to something else after gadfly called him out on it. Of course he still gives himself some leeway in claiming that autism is just as much a social disability as a medical one. Naturally Ne'eman provides no alternative to a cure for securing people's quality of life. He promotes the status quo for example by lobbying for full funding of IDEA. I don't think that even the most rabid proponent of special education for improving the quality of life for those on the spectrum would claim that it would do the same thing or even close to a cure.Ne'eman goes on to make this statement on autism being a disability which would contradict the first:Second, we should in every instance consider the fact that it is often social barriers rather than disability itself that pose the problems we face. No, my handwriting impairment, my phobias, my inability to perform the quality of work expected of me to hold down a job and my social problems that prevent me from having friends are not a social barrier.  The same goes for my self-stimulatory behaviors and inability to get things done.  They are strictly impairments in and off themselves.  Naturally Ne'eman gives no solutions to ameliorating these social barriers except a rather absurd comparison of anxiety to autism.  Previously Ne'eman (who as far as I know has never had paid employment of any kind in his life) suggests eliminating social pleasantry as a criterion for hiring.  So we are to expect employers to keep employees who run amok in the work place who  throw tantrums or who cuss the boss out?  Ne'eman gives augmented communication as a solution for nonverbal autistics neglecting to provide evidence or studies that it works for every nonverbal autistic or even the majority of cases. Ne'eman ends his essay by taking the usual shot at autism speaks and claiming that the cure philosophy has failed us.  Ne'eman still gave the Isabelle Souleries study funded by autism speaks a shoutout, claiming it proved that autistics aptitudes are underestimated.  On a final note of this lengthy blog post I will concede the search for a cure has not yet produced fruitful results.  That does not mean it won't at some point in time.  Even if a cure is not possible in the foreseeable future perhaps science can provide better treatments at some point in time. In light of his inevitable appointment to the national disabilities commission I will look forward to seeing whether or not Mr. Ne'eman can actually produce these results in autistics that he claims possible without a cure.  After his appointment is confirmed by the senate he will certainly be in a position to do so.  Whether or not Ne'eman can produce his promised results only time will tell.   \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dsq-sds.org/article/view/1059/1244", "http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/28/42/10746"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/02/interesting-essay-by-ari-neeman.html", "title": "\nInteresting essay by Ari Ne'eman\n"},

In addition to his most horrid autistic adult award, he also gives some sort of award for best medical professional who has made contributions to the autism community. His last award was given to psychologist Nick Dubin whom most gadfly readers will remember has been charged with downloading child pornography from the internet. Gluyas has refused to retract the award.One wonders what the chances are of this august gentleman being elected to a seat in the Australian parliament. Well here in the good old U.S.A. which a few years ago passed the combating autism act we have Ari Ne'eman and John Robison who craft autism public policy and decide which research gets funded at taxpayer expense as well as funding of Morton Gernsbacher's research.

{"date": " August 7, 2010", "body": "\nI have been following a rather interesting thread on that aptly named website that has banned your humble blogger from commenting, Wrongplanet. Though Alan Griswold was the exception to the rule of ND's who criticized Dr. Laurent Mottron for holding out his hat to collect money from the organization whose goal he claims is nonsensical and his statement that autism is a harmless condition and no ND's to the best of my knowledge have taken Michelle Dawson to task for accepting money from the organization she so clearly despises, there do seem to be some denizens of Plank's own website that have taken him to task for his consumption of cooked crow and accepting money from the organization he so clearly has opposed and maligned in the past. Ironically enough Plank once wrote a tongue-in-cheek April's fool joke essay about how he had taken over autism speaks-the likelihood that this represented wishful thinking on his part. As my former psychoanalyst would have said, the shoe appears to be on the other foot with wrongplanet not being above accepting donations from autism speaks and perhaps changing their tune in terms of their attitudes towards autism speaks, details to follow.Of course Plank tries to rationalize his actions to the wrong planet denizens. However, he does not seem clever enough to come up with anything original but rather utilizes the excuses of his predecessors who partook of the forbidden fruit of the autism speaks trough. His statement that autism speaks does not influence the content means he is not a sellout, is reminiscent of what one of the more unsavory characters in the ND movement told me justified Michelle Dawson's accepting money from AS for research. This means that the DNC should accept money from republicans even if the republicans are not influencing policy.He also makes the fallacious statement that autism speaks has a person on the autism speaks board of directors who is on the spectrum. Of course it is possible that Plank may be stretching the truth a bit in that he means that his partner's father, Robison, sr. is on a scientific advisory board of autism speaks which is not the same thing as the board of directors. Robison also certainly has no understanding of what 99.999% of autistic persons in the world go through as these experiences are clearly an abstraction to him.Plank also steals Michael John Carley's thunder by claiming that autism speaks is changing and is starting to support autistic persons. He claims this person whose post he is responding to can call him on the phone to get the details privately yet does not want to release this info publicly on wrongplanet. Interesting that he is saying autism speaks does not influence the material in his videos, but I am wondering if the underwriting of his expenses in making the videos have influenced these statements of praise for this organization which he previously had nothing but bad things to say about, including implying that they were engaging in eugenics of autistic persons. Why would Plank insist on just confiding this to a friend in a phone call, why not tell the entire world in the thread of these details if they have any veracity?Plank also seems to imply that his accepting funding for his videos means that anyone else with an ND perspective who is an ND proponent can now have a say in how the organization they detest so much will spend their money. Well, wrong planet members, I have this bridge in Brooklyn and......Last but not least John Robison himself steps on the soapbox. I will paste the part of his statement that I find particularly offensive and dissect it:When I joined the Autism Speaks board earlier this year I made the point that they should be working with other groups, and this affiliation with Alex is one such example. Many of you have been quick to criticize Autism Speaks for not having autistic people working for them . . . I held out Alex and Jack for video production, and you criticize them them for taking up the offer. Well, Jack and Alex are on the spectrum, and they are going to help Autism Speaks with video production. That's the kind of inclusion you asked for, and I think it deserves support, not ridicule.First of all, John Robison, it is misleading for you to say you are on the board of autism speaks. You only serve on one of their scientific advisory committees and not on the board of directors itself. You are just trying to give credence to Plank's phony statement.No, John, this is not the inclusion that I asked for. I suspect it is not the inclusion anyone else asked for either. I have criticized autism speaks' autism in the workplace dog and pony show on multiple occasions. Giving your son and his friend money to have a good time going around the country making videos of various people is not giving an unemployed autistic person who needs to make a living a job. The two are totally different. No, I do not believe that autism speaks should work with people whose goals are completely different from theirs and who in fact are working against the noble goal of trying to cure autism and prevent newborn children from becoming autistic (no not abortions) or who are at least using science to try to mitigate this horrible disability while cure and/or prevention are still not possible. Some may find this inflammatory, but autism speaks should no less be involved with neurodiversity than the local police department or FBI should be involved with the Mafia. There is no justification for including the evil ND's in their game plan.I realize that autism speaks (including board member Jon Shestack) have made justifications for Mottron's funding claiming he was doing work that might help nonverbal autistics or help autistics achieve more educational potential or help with parenting and employment.I am still trying to understand what possible justification there is for AS to be funding these videos and these kids in their early 20s who are barely affected by their autism if at all who come from affluent backgrounds and can find ways to pay for the videos themselves. In fact, if John Robison thinks these videos are so important and he has made money from his book (his second book coming out soon as well) and his various entrepreneurial endeavors then why he can't pick up the tab for these videos since his own son is one of the people involved? This way the money AS is spending on these videos could go for really important things like helping autistic people find jobs or finding friends or lovers or doing scientific research to help autistic people function better if not cure them or prevent autism in the first place.I don't understand how these videos are helping autism speaks as Robison claims they are. In fact I don't understand how they are helping anyone except for Alex Plank, \"Cubby\" Robison and Steve Silberman plug his future book.Well again I guess in spite of my now five and a half decades on this planet there are some things I will never understand.I have also been told there may be some problems in commenting in autism gadfly by one of my readers. I am not sure what is causing this and I have checked it out and it seems to be okay. However, if anyone has trouble commenting or deserving comments on this thread don't get published I apologize in advance.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt133968.html", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/article366.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/08/alex-plank-sycophantic-saga-continues.html", "title": "\nAlex Plank: The Sycophantic Saga continues\n"},
{"date": " January 3, 2011", "body": "\nI have had an interesting start to the new year in that I finished a first draft of that novel that I have worked on off and on for about 3 years now.  In fact I first wrote about my starting it on Jonathan's journal in my stories webpage where I briefly blogged just before starting autism's gadfly.I realize that though a milestone of sorts, a first draft of a novel (at least in my case) does not mean a whole lot in terms of marketability, or publishability. The nice thing about this blog is that I can write posts on the fly without being accountable to an editor for what they are worth (or not worth depending on your viewpoint) and then have some interested people read them. One is not afforded the same luxury with a novel or non-fiction book, or an article you want published someplace and you are accountable to some other entity. Usually, unless the writer is extremely skilled (far more skilled than I am) they have to do extensive editing and re-writing to obtain a finished product ready for submission. I am not sure I am capable of doing that with a book, though technically I have written three books now (four if you count a book length collection of short stories as a book).Though I realize I have sometimes been lax in my re-writing of posts on this blog, I am gratified that I have now been writing semi-regular posts on autism's gadfly for just about three years and I have developed a following, albeit a small one, of devoted readers. Not only that this blog seems to generate a large amount of comments for a small tiny spec in the blogosphere.I wrote briefly about my novel in progress last year in another gadfly post.It would seem now, the real work of rewriting will begin. I think it is too late to enroll in a ucla extension course, for next week, so i may have to wait until April. I don't have as much money as I did at one time to hire a book doctor and for The School of Hard Knocks I was not too inclined to listen to them anyhow and they did not give me a  good direction.  I suppose that unfortunately I am one of those writers who wants the book doctor to tell me that I am another Dostoyevsky and my novel needs no work, so not sure what the next step will be. I still dream of using my autism as a gimmick for commercial success.  For those who are interested, I wrote about that idea in the post that I linked to last year and they can read it.  I learned some hard lessons from that.  Of course now, high functioning autistics with intact intelligence are no longer considered such an anomaly.  This might reduce the value of using disability as a gimmick in marketability of a book.    In fact, we have John Elder Robison representing all autistics on the AS science board.  Stephen Shore and Ari Ne'eman are supposed to represent our interests on the IACC.  These three individuals have a functioning level that far surpasses mine. Of course one of the lessons learned was that a seemingly sure fire gimmick for publication is no substitute for the arduous effort it will take to write a product ready for publication.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/01/finished-first-draft-of-novel-in.html", "title": "\nFinished a first draft of novel in progress\n"},
{"date": " November 29, 2010", "body": "\nAs most readers of the gadfly blog know, those who oppose a cure for autism being invented believe that autism and what most rational people would consider other types of deficiencies or even defects in the brain of an individual that would impair them in life are just natural variations involving alternative forms of brain wiring.For this reason, they will be interested to know there is a new form of neurodiversity being researched, namely the effects of bullying on the developing brain.  The new science seems to be showing evidence that bullying causes hormonal changes that can produce damage (or change for neurodiversitites) in the brain.  It can reduce the growth of neurons, connectivity in the brain, etc.For example, neuroscientist Martin Teicher conducted brain scans on a variety of adolescents.  The ones who had been bullied, were shown to have abnormalities in the corpus callosum, which connects the right and left hemispheres of the brain.  There was evidence that the neurons in the corpus callosum had reduced myelin, the white matter of the brain which provides a sheath on the axons of neurons and facilitates transmission of impulses between nerve cells-which would influence functioning of the brain. Another study suggested that bullied boys have much higher levels of the hormone cortisol than nonbullied controls.  It has been suggested this can produce alterations in the hippocampus, the brain structure that controls short  term memories.  Experiments in bullied rats showed changes to the hippocampus and effects on memory. Perhaps this is the reason that so many persons in the neurodiversity movement are such bullies.  Just as father Flannigan in the movie \"Boys town\" stated that there was no such thing as a bad boy, they assert there is no such thing as a bad or defective brain only a different one.  In fact neurological differences are essential to survival of the species and autistic genes have produced every invention from the spear to the cell phone.  Bill Gates success and Einstein's theory of relatively are due to autistic traits or even autism.  So by being such bullies and insulting people, they are only ensuring survival of the human race by perpetuating yet another unique form of \"neurodiversity\".\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/11/28/inside_the_bullied_brain/?page=1"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/11/bullied-brainanother-form-of.html", "title": "\nThe bullied brain:another form of \"neurodiversity\"\n"},
{"date": " December 14, 2010", "body": "\nI see from reading a very interesting article that the 23-year-old profoundly autistic Adam Koumoutseas has been criminally charged with assault and battery for pounding his mother's head on a pavement. Ari Ne'eman, lead neurodiversity spokesman has stated that curing persons such as Adam is morally reprehensible and has crusaded against finding a cure for an individual such as this. Adam's father has stated that his son is incapable of understanding his actions and is hoping that his son will not have to stand trial. Adam is currently being assessed as to whether or not he is competent to stand trial. If it is decided that Adam is to be prosecuted it is likely his family will present a diminished capacity defense. Ne'eman has stated in his previous writings that there should be no diminished capacity defense of persons on the spectrum in criminal matters if autistics are to be equal with NT's and have to shoulder equal responsibility and if we are to assert that autism is not in fact a disorder but a legitimate way of being. In spite of this, Ne'eman and his organization, ASAN, have not really been consistent in their thinking and actions given that one of their crusades was to have the criminal charges dropped against Zach Price who was charged with assaulting one of his teachers.His mother was taken to the hospital with life threatening injuries but was reported to be in stable condition. A police sergeant on the scene tried to question Mr. Koumoutseas but only heard unintelligible sounds from the man. A court appointed psychologist who evaluated the man stated that it was almost impossible for him to express himself in words.I am curious as to what ASAN's solution is to this individual's situation. Will they just claim if the man's autism had been accommodated properly the assault on his mother would have never taken place? How could this individual's autism be accommodated for in such a manner? Is the solution (which would be inconsistent with acceptance and accommodation) be to throw the book at this individual, prosecute him and if convicted sentence him to years of incarceration? This would seem to be the solution that Ne'eman suggests in his Equality Demands Responsibility essay. Or would the third alternative be to forget about what was written in this essay and have ASAN take on the crusade of freeing this young man and saying the charges should be dropped? Ari Ne'eman has been appointed to a disabilities council by the Obama administration on which he serves at taxpayer expense. He also has a seat on the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee where as far as I can tell he has not offered any constructive solutions for any of the problems that befall persons on the spectrum, but has rather spent his time there making rude comments to one individual because he took umbrage to his cost analyses showing how expensive autism is to society.It is also possible that ND, and ASAN will make no comment at all about this case as it might show some flaws in their theories, philosophies and what they try to say. However, one can't help wondering about a person who is given money at taxpayer expense and by extension the organizations such as ASAN and others that he represent can remain silent and have a do nothing attitude about an issue like this.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.telegram.com/article/20101214/NEWS/12140391/1116", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/71/", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/08/ari-neeman-at-iacc-meeting.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/12/what-is-neurodiversitys-suggestion-for.html", "title": "\nWhat is neurodiversity's suggestion for Adam Koumoutseas?\n"},

I see that neurodiversity blogger, Kevin Leitch has given Simon Baron-Cohen's recent endorsement of ND a shout out. Most familiar with the issues of ND already know that Simon Baron-Cohen, though acknowledging some forms of autism can be problematic, has neurodiverse leanings. Kevin Leitch has also stated that those of us who write anti-neurodiversity posts on blogs are misrepresenting what it means, but neglects to go into any specifics. My gut reaction on reading this is Big Fucking Deal! But I suppose I should elaborate more than just my gut and try to use my brain (such as it is particularly from the point of view of my numerous detractors). We should also elaborate on how much credibility an endorsement from either of these parties has.Kevin Leitch, is a web designer, who designed and owned the autism hub, a collection of pro neurodiversity blogs whose original motto was, \"We don't need no stinkin' cure\". Being opposed to a cure for autism was basically the gist of this collection of blogs in the beginning. Leitch himself elaborated on this in an interview a few years back on episode 43 of autismpodcast.blogspot.com for those who are interested, they can find it on the web and listen to what Mr. Leitch had to say. He is also the father of a daughter with autism who at least at the time of the interview was virtually nonverbal. Leitch went on to say that not needing a cure was different than not wanting a cure and that if his daughter indicated that she desired a cure and there was one he would give it to her. It does not take rocket science to ponder how much common sense Mr. Leitch has, considering he would expect a nonverbal child to state that she desires a cure. Just as Laurent Mottron and Michelle Dawson have accepted a nearly half million dollar grant from autism speaks. SBC has accepted donations from the now defunct cure autism now and his one time postdoctoral fellow, Matthew Belmonte operated in part on a grant provided by CAN. Also, Mr. Leitch has an assistant blogger on his blog, some character that goes by the moniker, \"Sullivan\". Sullivan has written on the blog how Ari Ne'eman has never said that autism was not a disability. Gadfly has debunked that notion in the past and Mr. Sullivan made rather pathetic attempts at damage control, going on to say that neurodiversity has always acknowledged that autism is a disability.Leitch's shoutout of Baron-Cohen's recent blurb is particularly ironic in this regard as Baron-Cohen has written an essay questioning whether or not certain forms of autism should be regarded as disabilities. Cohen goes on to compare autism with left-handedness, trivializing this condition. A left-handed person is not impaired in their abilities to accomplish things and get things done. Cohen also compares the inability of spouses to get along and neighbors inability to get along with the social impairments of autism. Of course, bad marriages can be ended and people can move their residences, but someone can't remove their autism so the analogy fails. Baron-Cohen shows his lack of understanding of genetic principles by suggesting that though autistics don't often have children, autism has still remained in the populace so must have some sort of genetic advantage. Of course the most likely reason for this is De Novo mutations rather than evolutionary advantage.The article goes on with analogies such as autistics might be considered disabled because they spend more time with math than with people and analogies are given that Michael Jordan is fine motor impaired because he does not do needle work and other absurd analogies. It does not touch upon the problems that those with high functioning autism have in finding social relationships, impaired ability to acquire skills and behaviors that make them employable, etc.Without going into the rest of the rather pedantically written essay, which the interested reader can go to the link and read themselves, I will sum it up to say, that if Baron-Cohen had autism at a severity level of mine, he would not have been able attend graduate school, to become a professor, write and publish his books, marry and have his three children. If such were the case I think it likely he would consider high functioning autism a disability. I believe I would be considered high functioning by most standards.We also must look at the august list of persons who SBC acknowledges in having contributed to the essay. We can certainly judge SBC by the company he keeps or has kept in the past. Liane Wiley and David Andrews especially are conducive to a rolling of the intraocular muscles. One individual has suggested that autism is something to be celebrated. The other is one of the most cruel and vicious hatemongers in the ND movement. Who engages in a diatribe of profanity with anyone who dares disagree with him. Has a bigoted, condescending and ableist attitude towards your humble blogger, whom he has mocked for being too impaired to have the same academic performance that he himself had. He also has never been in a special education school in his life by his own admission and added the comment that because I was in special ed, that made him glad that he was never in it. In regards to David Andrews, Clay Adams, Phil Gluyas, Kim Wombles and Dave Seidel and probably other individuals in the ND movement who have spent time mocking me and ridiculing me, one of Baron-Cohen's statements regarding ND is particularly ironic:Stigmatizing anyone, whether they have autism or any other characteristic, is wrong, since the point about these labels is not to pick out the person in order to make their lives worse, but to help others understand their special needs and qualities.So, yeah, Kev, if you happen to read this, your credibility is zero and I say big fucking deal to your endorsement and Baron-Cohen's endorsement of neurodiversity. I can only hope that if a cure is found in your and your daughter's lifetime you won't listen to Alex Plank's dictum that most autistics don't want to be cured and then come to that conclusion when you ask your daughter if she wants a cure and she does not answer you.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/12/professor-simon-baron-cohen-endorses-neurodiversity/", "http://www.larry-arnold.net/Neurodiversity/Mission/disability.htm"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/12/kevin-leitch-and-simon-baron-cohen.html", "title": "\nKevin Leitch and Simon Baron-Cohen endorse neurodiversity: BFD!\n"},
{"date": " January 20, 2011", "body": "\nAbout an hour ago, I came back home from The Emotions lab at Cal tech, run by neuroscientist Ralph Adolphs. I participated in some more experiments involving some questinonaires, this sort of experiment involving the Stroop effect where I have to name what a color is when a color word is put in a different color than the word. For example Greenaand having to chose the color red instead of the color green. They also had this eye tracking experiment where I had to wear a camera on my head that tracks eye movements, while I look at some faces and photos of scenery and decide which of two choices is the most attractive. I am not sure what the purpose of these experiments are and what they are trying to measure in autistic persons, but I am able to make $80 for an afternoon's work which is nice considering my financial situation is not as lucrative as it was four years ago or so. Of course some of the money is taken in the costs of gas in driving to Pasadena which is probably about 30 miles or more from where I live. I got to see post doctoral fellow Dan Kennedy again, and say hello to him. I first started participating about a year ago and I have written about my experiences doing this. The eye tracker was kind of a hassle because I had to wear this camera on top of my head while doing it, and it took them a long time to set up the calibrations for it, but they finally did it.  Apparently this device is very \"finnicky\" as they put it and it takes a long time to set it up.   It was nice to be able to have something constructive to do for the good part of the day and some interaction with some persons as well as making some money.  There is sort of an irony involved in all of these people rejecting me because of my autism, but there someone actually wants me because of my autism and wants to pay me some money for it.  It is as close as I can get to having a job right now, though not quite the same I guess.  Course I am enjoying retirement somewhat also.  Also, the Courchesne lab contacted me recently and wanted me to participate in this study they are now doing. I used to be a research subject with them but have not done so for a while now.  I could have made a couple hundred dollars doing that but it involved driving down to San Diego (more than 120 miles each way) on at least two or more different occasions and having some testing and MRI scanning done as well as having a skin biopsy taken from my buttocks.  I guess I was squeamish about the skin biopsy and at the time I was having some dermatologic problems with ringworm on my buttocks which has resolved.  It is interesting in apparently the idea is that they can do some sort of stem cell thing where they turn skin cells into neurons and the autistic neurons may develop differently than normal controls.  I can't help feeling a little guilty that my participating might have made the difference between curing (or at least making a major therapeutic breakthrough in autism) autism in a much shorter time.  So at some point I may reconsider my participation in that study if it is not too late, but we shall see. Another issue that concerns me is that they are only interested in high functioning autistics in a lot of these studies, at least at Cal Tech, as it involves compliance with the eye tracking device and being able to use a computer properly and reading the choices on the computer.  I wish there was some way to do research on the lower functioning people so they could have a shot of a decent life and being able to talk and such, but so it goes.  I think Adolph's lab is still looking for research subjects 18 years of age and up with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome.  They pay $20 an hour for various experiments and $50 an hour for undergoing an MRI scan.  So if anyone is interested I guess they can contact the lab. I believe the number of the lab is included in the post that I linked to from last year.  If it isn't I guess someone can post a comment to me or send me email and I can give them the number.    \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/01/more-work-at-cal-tech.html", "title": "\nmore work at cal tech\n"},
{"date": " January 25, 2011", "body": "\nAs regular readers of autism's gadfly know, a few years ago neurodiversity activist Ari Ne'eman wrote an essay entitled Equality Demands Responsibility in which the gist of the essay was that persons on the spectrum should not use insanity pleas or diminished capacity defenses when charged with crimes. That if we were to state a cure was not necessary then an autistic person was expected to obey the law. If not, they should be prosecuted and suffer the same consequences as the neurotypical law breaker.A few years later, Ne'eman, and his organization, the autistic self-advocacy network, digressed from the tenets of this essay, when a young special education student was charged with assaulting his teachers. I wrote about this elsewhere. This youngster should not be prosecuted for his crime because of his autism ASAN said. The Midnight in Chicago blog in a recent post has suggested if I am not misunderstanding them is that those who engage in autism advocacy may have ulterior motives for doing so. They write:Again, I say to you that it is important that you carefully evaluate the motives and intentions of people and organizations in the advocacy field. Often times they are advocating for personal or selfish reasons, rather than advocating in the interest of seeing that true justice is served to those on the autism spectrumThis could serve as an explanation for the inconsistencies between Ne'eman's essay and their advocacy efforts on behalf of the young special education student from Arkansas. However, I am not sure what ulterior motive ASAN would have for their actions, but perhaps there is one.Retired neurodiversity blogger \"The autistic bitch from hell\" has suggested that the reason certain autistic persons crusade against the neurodiversity movement and efforts of autistic self-advocates is because they are on welfare or social security and refuse to take responsibility for their lives and are worried that these efforts will jeopardize their welfare benefits. I find this assertion interesting as a crusader against neurodiversity and a critic of the autistic self advocacy network, who for more than 27 years tried his ass off to make a living, applied for hundreds of jobs, worked sporadically with some success, endured multiple firings and all the headaches of having to avoid going on the dole or being completely supported by my parents just to avoid the fate that ABFH claimed that I covet so much.  Yet, two of the highest (at the time) profile spokespersons for the autistic civil rights and neurodiversity movement, Frank Klein and Amanda Baggs were both on welfare and/or social security and as far as I know never worked a day in their lives.  It is also interesting in light of the fact that Ari Ne'eman stated that he supported money being spent from the Obama administration's economic stimulus package to expedite processing of social security disability claims and hearings at the administrative law level and in federal district courts and circuit courts of appeal.  The fact that ASAN has lobbied for Medicaide waivers for persons with autism in various states as well. All of these facts has just gotten me to thinking.  Should the equality demands responsibility ploy just be restricted to criminal behavior as well as those of us unemployed autistics whom ABFH asserts are just lazy loafers who won't work and take responsibility for our lives? What about in special education?  What about the state regional center services in California?  What about behavior in school and in the workplace? The IDEA law, which ASAN has lobbied for funding for costs the taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.  If equality demands responsibility and autism is to be considered a legitimate way of being rather than a disease shouldn't ASAN be lobbying to abolish it and claiming that autistics should be educated in the same manner as their NT peers for the same amount of money and no extra money be spent on special education for these children, after all, equality demands responsibility? The state of California where I live is billions of dollars in the hole.  Jerry Brown, our new governor has created a hornet's nest by proposing drastic cuts in the state budget.  According to the equality demands responsibility mantra the families of children with developmental disabilities should not be lobbying for state services at taxpayer expense.  They should be lobbying for Brown and the state legislature to close down the state regional centers and responsible parents of autistic children should no longer avail themselves of these services if they are to assert their children are equal to NT children and don't need a cure. What about inappropriate behavior and social skills among persons with autism.  Shouldn't we expect them to always behave in an appropriate manner in spite of their autism?  After all, equality demands responsibility.  This is in spite of the fact that Ari Ne'eman stated social pleasantry should be eliminated as a criteria for hiring people for jobs and evaluating their work performance. According to the equality demands responsibility mantra, autistics should not be allowed diminished capacity defenses in criminal proceedings under any circumstance,they should not be allowed social security benefits and should work for a living.  They should take responsibility for their own behavior and should not be allowed services by government if we are to state that no cure should be sought for autism and to do so is morally reprehensible. I don't see ASAN and other advocacy organizations lobbying for any of these things.  All I see is one inconsistency and digression from the Equality Demands Responsibility tenet after another.  Or perhaps the midnight in Chicago blog is indeed correct.  That the autistic advocacy organizations have an ulterior motive for all of their activities and perhaps don't really give a flying fuck about autistics' rights.  I wonder what this ulterior motive could be.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/71/", "http://midnightinchicago.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/deliberate-deception-what-advocates-arent-telling-you-part-ii/", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2006/02/autistic-uncle-toms.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/01/equality-demands-responsibility.html", "title": "\nEquality Demands Responsibility Revisited\n"},
{"date": " February 17, 2011", "body": "\nAs a person with high functioning autism who has not worked in over four years and has been fired from approximately 20 jobs or more, as well as having significant problems on others where I was forced to resign, I was interested in hearing from my friend, Stephen Shore, about a newly formed organization whose purpose is to help persons on the spectrum find and keep employment. Steve serves on the advisory board of this organization.This organization has the cute acronym ASTEP, which stands for Asperger's syndrome training and employment partnership.As I suspect I am not the only person with autism and/or Asperger's syndrome who has had problems in the workplace, this interests me greatly. This is light of the fact that the Obama administration has appointed to various government policy posts a never employed 22 year old who states that a solution for unemployment among persons with autism is to eliminate social pleasantry as a criteria for hiring and evaluating people's job performance. Also it is rumored that a person high up in his advocacy organization is the retired neurodiversity blogger \"the autistic bitch from hell\" who has stated that those of us with ASD's on/or applying to be on the dole are nothing but lazy loafers who don't want to take responsibility for our lives so we spend time interfering with the noble individuals of this advocacy organization who are trying to do something about job discrimination against autistic persons.We also have autism speaks who promotes an autism in the workplace dog and pony show yet has never, to the best of my knowledge, hired an autistic person to work for their organization even as a minimum wage janitor or file clerk with a job coach or contributed to the employment of an autistic individual in any way. The exception to this could be their giving money to that Robin Hood-in-reverse, John Elder Robison, to help pay for the costs of his son's film making endeavors, in exchange for lending his celebrity to their organization by serving on an advisory board. In Gadfly's opinion, this is not much different than Warren Buffett serving as an advisor on an organization designed to help the homeless then giving him money.So, on superficial analysis, it would seem that ASTEP might be a noble cause and this newly found organization might be something that could do some good, if they were able to help autistic people find and keep work. However, it would seem unclear to me on exactly how this is done. The photo on their homepage shows persons working in what would appear to be prestigious, highly skilled work such as in a science laboratory or computer job. I have to wonder, how many persons on the spectrum are capable of receiving the training for doing this job and how realistic is this. I am also curious where these photos were obtained and if any of these people at all have Asperger's or autism.One intriguing item is apparently there are government subsidies for hiring people with disabilities. One of the things that I attempted when I was struggling to make a living was going to this organization ADEPT (I don't remember what the acronym stood for) which I don't think is any longer in existence. The jobs that I applied for, for the most part did not want to hire me and make an agreement with ADEPT. The one job I got that made an agreement with ADEPT, transcribing some radiology reports, fired me after a month. After this I got another job where they declined to make an agreement with ADEPT and I held this job for more than two years.They also apparently talk about disclosure of the diagnosis as part of the basis of their plan for helping those on the spectrum and giving counseling to their clients and prospective employers about accommodations that could be made. What exactly these accommodations are and how they could help persons on the spectrum be employed, I don't know. I have not read everything on the site, yet, so perhaps, there is something I missed. I just know that part of ADEPTs strategy was this sort of thing, disclosure and subsidizing the persons did not work out for me.I don't believe that disclosure is tremendously helpful based on my own personal experiences. It would likely result in someone not being hired, or if they were hired, if the employer did not like them for some reason, or they had bad behavior on the job or problems with work performance, it would not dissuade them from firing that person.Another red flag is their citing various offices of state departments of rehabilitation around the country and apparently part of their strategy is to have an alliance with these government organizations. I would only recommend the services of the California state department of rehabilitation to my most mortal enemies and that might be cruel even to these people.About two years ago I wrote a blog post about my bad experiences with California's state rehab department so the interested reader can link to this and read about them to see what is wrong with this approach.Another reason to be wary of ASTEP is the citing of Temple Grandin's books and work, where she implies that most autistic people have special talents and gives the solution of having mentors and claiming that obsessions can be channeled into work careers, yet neglecting to give any specific examples of these besides herself. The sad story of Darius McCollum is certainly one example where this approach would not be workable. Grandin also gives examples of good jobs and bad jobs for autistic people. Medical transcription, which I did on and off in various places was given as a bad job for persons with autism. Though I was not able to succeed in this field well enough to continue working in it, there is the old cliche' about the glass being half full rather than half empty. I was more successful and made more money doing this than anything else and there were a variety of transcription jobs I was able to keep for reasonably lengthy periods of time, one of them more than nine years.Perhaps the biggest eyeroll of all is the executive director of the program, one Michael John Carley. Carley, who is married and has two children and received an AS diagnosis in his mid 30s after his son was diagnosed has claimed that there is a universal feeling among autistics that \"we\" don't want to be cured. As most readers of this blog can guess, I take umbrage to this.Carley, as reported by MJ, author of the autism jabberwocky blog has stated that proposed changes in the DSM are \"hard for him to swallow because he does not want to be associated with head bangers and diaper wearers\". Apparently, Carley would prefer fancying himself an Einstein or a Gates and claiming these two had Asperger's than a person who has had life impairments due to their ASD. One has to wonder how much sympathy Carley would have for those of us who have employment problems. Would he find being lumped in with us, 'hard to swallow'? This would reduce his credibility in my eyes as a director of an organization that seeks to help ASD persons with employment issues.Interestingly, Carley at one time made a living as a diplomat for the United Nations. This seems rather ironic in light of the rather undiplomatic statements that he has made about persons with autism who do not function in the world as well as he does. I wonder whether the reason Carley is now doing work in autism related fields and is no longer a diplomat is because he worked in a profession he was so ill-suited for and had to leave it. If he can't even pick a job he has a good aptitude for,how can he help other persons?I realize that this is a very new organization and perhaps I should heed the old saw, \"don't judge a book by its cover\" and maybe give ASTEP a chance and see if they are actually successful in helping those of us on the spectrum find and keep work.Though I will withhold judgement until all the facts are in, I still can't help thinking that ASTEP might be a misstep.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.asperger-employment.org/index.html", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/02/rant-michael-john-carley-finds-autism.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/02/will-astep-be-misstep.html", "title": "\nWill ASTEP be a misstep?\n"},

In this, their latest crusade, they are complaining against a meeting that the CDC had where they are trying to add wandering as a medical diagnosis and Ne'eman and his cronies fear that somehow the civil rights of autistic children who engage in elopement and run away will be violated if this is enacted. Ne'eman complains about an online survey being bad science in spite of the fact that he quoted an online March of Dimes survey claiming that this proved that the alleged 80% divorce rate among parents of autistic children was a myth.This is very ironic in light of my post of a few days ago where we see the lunatic ravings of one of Ne'eman's possibly more disturbed supporters claiming that parents of low functioning autistic children wish their charges would just 'drop dead'.It would appear now that the shoe is on the other foot and it is Ne'eman himself who would appear to have a cavalier attitude about the lives of low functioning autistic children who often engage in elopement and wander away and die in accidental drownings and traffic accidents. I will concede to Ne'eman's credit that he did express condolences over the passing of low functioning autistic Ashley Brock when she drowned on Ginger Taylor's adventures in autism blog. However, Ne'eman, who has stated that curing autism would be morally reprehensible, has offered no alternatives to preventing these children from dying in drownings or traffic accidents when they elope and wander away. He just gives some vague statements about how the environment could be modified and the reason that these kids elope or run away is sensory issues, yet fails to provide any scientific basis for this. Until it is proven that alternatives to labeling kids wanderers and finding ways to restrict their movements in order to keep them alive or a cure for autism is found (which Ne'eman opposes) then I will be completely baffled by ASAN and their supporters who first insult parents by claiming that they wish their offspring would just 'drop dead' but then actively opposing measures that could prevent these kids from dying in accidents in the first place.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=130"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/03/does-ari-neeman-want-low-functioning.html", "title": "\nDoes Ari Ne'eman want low functioning autistic children to die in drownings or traffic accidents?\n"},

{"date": " April 5, 2011", "body": "\nI see that rogue scientist Laurent Mottron is at it again using results from a metaanalysis of various research showing enhanced visual perception in what is likely a limited subset of persons with autism in order to claim that trying to cure autistic children is a bad thing. As has been written before autism speaks, an organization which advertises on its walks and fundraisers that they are funding research to find a cure for autism has given this man a nearly half million dollar grant As has been previously written on Autism's gadfly, At the time this grant was awarded it amounted to 5% of autism speaks net assets. Not an insignificant amount. Dr. Mottron states: it adds another argument against attempts to \"cure\" autistics. \"When we try to turn an autistic toddler into a non-autistic toddler, it's painful, it's expensive and it does not work,\" he said. \"We should not try to assimilate or break the difference (between autistics and nonautistics), but just admit that it's a difference that has good and bad consequences.\" While I do agree with Mottron that it is not possible given the current state of the art to turn an autistic toddler into a nonautistic one, I do disagree that research that attempts to find a cure or ways to ameliorate autism should not be funded. Autism is more than just a difference. Whatever good consequences it may or may not have,particularly in a small subset of individuals, are far outweighed by the bad. It is really even a further stretch to argue that this research proves it. I will concede I have not read the original source, only the abstract linked on Michelle Dawson's TMOB comment board. However, I have read Isabelle Souleries' study which was published in this same journal. This study had, in my opinion, a myriad of methodological problems which I have commented on elsewhere An additional problem that I was unaware of at the time was that the Raven's matrices is not a timed test, yet they were claiming that the autistics who were matched on intelligence with the typical controls who performed the test faster were somehow superior in some way. Given that this is a nonstandard use of the testing instrument, this really does not seem to have any credibility. There is little doubt that Souleries' study is one of the studies that they are using to formulate this hypothesis. If the rest of the studies have the same limitations, particularly with the use of a subset of pretty high functioning autistics, who have no discrepancies in their scores on the verbal and performance tests of the Wechsler, then there is a real problem with claiming this is scientifically valid work, let alone using it as a reason not to do research to attempt to cure or at least mitigate autistic symptoms. Autism is a horrific disability and disease. We need to fund more research to help mitigate this disability with the ultimate goal that we can cure it and that at some point in time autism will be a thing of the past. Hopefully this effort will continue in spite of Dr. Mottron's sophistry.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Autistic+brains+work+differently+Researchers/4555146/story.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/04/more-convoluted-logic-from-laurent.html", "title": "\nMore convoluted logic from Laurent Mottron\n"},
{"date": " April 19, 2011", "body": "\nI see that John Elder Robin Hood-in-reverse is at it again giving his words of wisdom and practical advice from his experiences as a person on the autism spectrum. Gadfly wonders why if JER really cares about helping out those on the spectrum, why he would solicit and accept funds for his own personal use from a charitable organization where he serves in an advisory capacity that is designed (or at least advertised as) as an entity to help those on the spectrum far less fortunate than himself. Robison starts out that stating that \"study after study\" has shown that 20 to 40 hours a week of intervention with autistic kids has shown they have far better outcomes as adults than kids left on their own. I am curious as to which studies he is referring to. Certainly not Lovaas (1987) in which no adult outcomes have ever been provided, yet is considered by some as the definitive proof that there is hope for autistics to have a coin-flip probability of normalcy and not have be dependent on the dole. He also recommends helping a child find out what they are good at and helping them excel at that skill. He uses himself as an example of one who was encouraged in auto mechanics and technology. Never mind that most on the spectrum (regardless of whether they have Asperger's or autism) are not at the functioning level of this gentleman and won't be able to accomplish what he has. Another word of wisdom is that kids need to avoid making enemies. They need to learn how to act and conform to the rest of the crowd. This is in spite of the fact that he gave a plug for his new book with the ironic title \"Be different\" at the beginning of the post. It is nothing more than a simple quick fix solution that autistic kids or Asperger's kids with loud voices and funny movements are ever going to be able to control this and they can immediately be accepted by others and not make enemies.

{"date": " April 15, 2011", "body": "\nOne of the many tenets of neurodiversity is that autism is not comparable to diseases like cancer because autism does not kill. This has been proven wrong many times in the instances where autistic children died in accidental drownings (for example Ashley Brock) or James Deloroy who got lost and died in a snowstorm or children hit by cars, trains etc. due to their autism. From Autism speaks and the California DDS and a new journal article it would seem that there is evidence of a much higher mortality rate in persons with autism who have the comorbid diagnosis of epilepsy than in autism alone. These data found that the percentage of persons who had autism and epilepsy was higher than previously thought. So this is one reason that neurodiversity is yet again incorrect about autism not killing people and another reason we need to find a cure for autism. In an email I received from autism speaks this was elaborated on even further: It is well established that epilepsy is a major medical disorder that is often co-morbid with autism in as many as 30 percent of children. As many as one in 20 children diagnosed with autism by age 3 could either already have epilepsy or develop epilepsy later in life. As noted by the ATP more than a decade ago, sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has been identified as a cause of death in individuals with autism. Higher mortality rates than in the general population have been reported among individuals with autism, however, there is relatively little known about the specific risk factors that account for the reported higher-than-expected rate of mortality in autism. \u201cSudden, unexpected or unexplained death in autism is often, but not always related to epilepsy and we need to use caution when interpreting these data,\u201d explained Autism Speaks Vice President of Clinical Programs Clara Lajonchere, Ph.D. \u201cThese findings are important for understanding risk factors that may contribute to early death in individuals with autism and further underscore the need for more accurate and accessible records on cause of death in this population. Furthermore, state surveillance programs should implement better tracking mechanisms to help us better understand mortality for individuals with autism and co-occurring disorders such as epilepsy. Critical initiatives supported by Autism Speaks brain tissue program will help bring these issues to the fore and provide information our community needs to help prevent early death in persons with autism.\u201d Though, this does not affect all persons with autism it is not an insignificant number, so once again neurodiversity can choke on this data while they are saying that nothing is wrong with having autism and that autism is not a life-threatening condition.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-04/as-mri041411.php"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/04/higher-mortality-rate-of-autistics-with.html", "title": "\nHigher mortality rate of autistics with epilepsy\n"},
{"date": " May 11, 2011", "body": "\nThe media has been making much lately of an autism prevalence study done in Korea in which a nearly 3% autism prevalence has been found. \"Is autism more common than previously thought?\" is the rhetorical question of the day.Gadfly has now read this study in its entirety (excepting some supplementary data things that appear online). Michelle Dawson, on her TMOB comment board, as of a few days ago, reported that the study was behind a paywall and she still had not read it. I checked out the abstract and was able to download the whole study and read it yesterday, so apparently something changed in two days.On a less superficial analysis of the study itself, it would seem the media is once again indulging in \"yellow journalism\" and a misrepresentation of the facts. Two separate groups were studied. They were very different. In statistics, they are what would be called a bimodal sample. There was a high probability group, who had been previously diagnosed and was receiving a variety of special education services. Another group was screened from the general population of a small area of Korea (not the entire country) and this was referred to as a general population group. They had never attended special education school, never received or requestedany services and apparently never received a diagnosis of autism, though they were all between the ages of 7-12. Of the 2.64/100 prevalence reported it was 1.89/100 in the general group but only .75/100 in the high probability group. Therefore, the high probability group had a lower prevalence than what has been found in recent CDC surveys here in the USA.The study also found a male to female ratio in the high probability group of 5.1:1 which is fairly close to most reported figures in the literature. Interestingly, the general population group found a much lower ratio of 2.5:1 of males to females. To the best of my knowledge, no study of gender differentiation of autistics has found such a number. This includes ratios in the higher functioning groups which are often reported as 10:1 or higher, much higher than for the general population of autistics. Female neurodiversity activists have claimed, contrary to other evidence, that autism in females has been underestimated and that they are typical of autistic people, might they use the results of this study to bolster their arguments?Blogger Harold Doherty seems to enjoy writing about the high percentage of intellectual disabilities in persons diagnosed with regular autistic disorder as opposed to all ASD's. The number of persons in the general population sample with intellectual disabilities was 16%, whereas it was 59% in the high probability group. Though apparently some neurodiversity bloggers have questioned Doherty's assertions, the results of this study would seem to give his arguments at least some validity as the ratio for autistic disorders to all ASD's in the high probability group is 2.6:1, whereas it is inversed at 1:2.6 in the separate general population group that was sampled.Another limitation of this study was the response rate, 63% in the general population. The relatively low response rate in the general population could have easily inflated the prevalence, as parents concerned about a diagnosis would have been the ones to respond.Missing data may have accounted for some of the results, as in 6.1% of the cases one of the two pages of the ASSQ surveying questionnaire were missing, the authors made some adjustments and this could have affected results.Statistical adjustments or \"weighting\" were made to factor in the prevalence based on nonparticipants. The authors neglect to show any data for these.The ASSQ survey and the diagnostic instruments such as the ADOS were of North American origin, yet were being used on a people of a completely different culture. Could this be a factor?Most striking of all is the fact that after the survey was completed by the general population students, only 33% of them had a full assessment by a doctor giving them a diagnosis! This, in my opinion, really reduces the credibility of the validity of the diagnoses and consequently the prevalence numbers.The authors claimed the students were able to perform okay in regular school in spite of their autism because of the structured Korean 12 hour school day. I doubt any of the authors were ever autistic children themselves with more than intact intelligence and had to spend 8 years in special education because of profound behavioral problems. As someone with first hand experience in this area, I dispute the authors contention.Not surprisingly, this study was funded by that circus sideshow without a tent, autism speaks. This is an organization that gives rogue doctors who state that autism is a harmless condition half a million dollar research grants and who put a wealthy high school dropout on their scientific advisory board amongst M.D. and Ph.D. scientists. This individual, though certainly wealthier than 99.9% of all autistics, myself included, solicited and was awarded money for his own personal use from this organization. Apparently, for some reason, a study like this would be much more costly to do in the united states.One wonders why autism speaks would fund a study of such questionable validity. They seem to want to appease to the ND anticure movement such as Mottron and his disciples as well as John Elder Robin Hood-in-reverse. They also want to seem to appeal to the \"thimerosal causes autism\" crowd and others who state that some agent in the environment has caused a huge autism increase in the past 25 years. Another likely reason was that in these recessionary times, funding a study which would show such high rates of autism could be used as propaganda purposes, claiming that autism is a much greater problem than realized and this would induce more funding. Not that the half million dollar grant given to Mottron or the free money given to quasi-millionaire John Robison could not be spent on something more useful like helping autistic adults find jobs or finding more brains to autopsy, or on neuron regeneration research to find a cure. I will be interested in seeing what sort of spin AS will put on this very (at least in my opinion) questionable study. I wonder if this study will result in the start of a wild \"fishing expedition\" to find the environmental culprit that caused the prevalence of autism in Korea to be so high in spite of the huge differences in the two groups of children studied, and the questionable validity of the diagnoses (at least to me) of the general population children.Will the deranged hate mongers in that ugly cult called \"neurodiversity\" use this as fodder to claim that there is near parity between the sexes in autism ratios? Will they use this as an excuse to claim that autism is no big deal because most of the kids in this study are doing so well?Teen aged neurodiversity blogger Catatab Tabimount is using this studywhich she apparently has never bothered to read in its entirety to bolster arguments for special education and social skills training.Will others use this study to exploit their own political platform? Will the media continue to use this study (which I doubt any of the journalists reporting on it have read as I have) to continue hype about autism? Only time will tell.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://cheetahchottah.blogspot.com/2011/05/korean-survey-finds-1-in-38-people-have.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/05/korean-prevalence-study-media-hype-and.html", "title": "\nKorean Prevalence study: Media hype and fodder for fringe groups?\n"},
{"date": " May 23, 2011", "body": "\nI see that Kevin Leitch of the Left Brain/Right brain blog has given his take on the question of whether or not autism should be cured.I am glad that Kevin Leitch respects my desire, as a person on the autism spectrum, for a cure if one were available. However, he states that this would be a principle of neurodiversity. Again, he seems rather confused about neurodiversity whose proponents engage in scorn, derision and ridicule of any person on the autism spectrum who wishes a cure for themselves.This is also someone who has stated that he will only seek a cure for his daughter if she asks him to. His daughter, if I am not mistaken, is nearly completely nonverbal so one wonders how much sense that makes. This is a further problem in his argument in that not everyone can choose whether or not to accept or reject a cure, as a very significant number of persons with autism are nonverbal and can't communicate their desire for or against a cure.Furthermore, autism is a disorder of childhood whose onset is usually apparent before the age of 36 months (I realize this does not include Asperger's and some other ASD's who manifest themselves later in life). Children younger than 18 don't have the right of consent. Their parents have to make medical decisions for them and as Harold Doherty pointed out to Kev, this compounds the problem further.The most salient question in this debate, at least in my opinion, is are those who oppose a cure for autism willing to foot the bill for the vast majority of autistics who can't work and are receiving disability or other forms of taxpayer funded assistance. And for the treatments and the methods which Kevin Leitch refers to as helping autistics be the best they can be. At least some autistics who oppose curation live on the dole and receive other services at taxpayer expense. Amanda Baggs (whose diagnosis of autism is questionable) is one of the more well known examples of this. Economist Michael Ganz has shown in various studies that autism is expensive, very expensive. Who pays this expense, oftentimes the taxpayers. Neurodiversity has used hardball tactics to dispute such notions, such as Ari Ne'eman's ad hominem attacks on Mr. Ganz, accusing him of eugenics and baby killing in what is supposed to be a professional government meeting. Joseph of the natural variation blog first gave a 30% employment figure for persons with autism which he could give no actual reference source for and used this to claim this would not be a problem in the future and at some point, we could expect nearly full employment of autistics. Later, he went even further to state that based on the adult prevalence study in the UK with only 19 people that this was merely an urban legend that autistics had a higher rate of unemployment than nonautistics and they were employed and made a living in the same manner as nonautistics.Others have claimed that successful persons with autism such as Bill Gates and Steven Speilberg and their status as billionaires partially cancelled this out, making the net effect of autism's cost to society at least partially moot.Kev's good buddy Matt Carey (AKA \"Sullivan\") has been a very vocal proponent of special education and the IDEA law. I wonder If Mr. Carey shares Kev's view about a cure being a bad thing and unnecessary. If so, how does he reconcile this with the fact that the IDEA has cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars, has jammed the courts,and taken away money for other services financed by local property taxes such as police and fire protection which affect everyone regardless of whether or not they are autistic? Does Carey want to pay for all of these things out of his own pocket in lieu of a cure? So, assuming a cure were available, what right does any autistic person or there caregiver have to refuse a cure? Unless of course they are willing to pay the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars the autistic person will cost society over their lifetime out of their own pocket. I do not believe that an autistic person or their caregiver can have it both ways. That they can refuse a cure or something that will help them function better and continue to be a burden to taxpayers.I agree with Kev that a cure will be found at some point of time, though most likely not in my lifetime at age 55. It will not be easy though given that Ari Ne'eman can be appointed to various government positions, and rogue scientists such as Laurent Mottron and Isabelle Souleries and Morton Gernsbacher can continue to receive funding from public and private sector sources in spite of working against curing autism. Of course I remember the old Arab proverb, the dogs may bark but the caravan moves on.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/05/curing-autism/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/05/kevin-leitchs-take-on-cure-for-autism.html", "title": "\nKevin Leitch's take on a cure for autism\n"},

Ms. Seidel is married to a man who finds humor in the fact that someone would mock and ridicule someone with a disability, when one of the more cruel neurodiversity hatemongers was harassing me and ridiculing my disability and engaging in unauthorized use of my photos on the internet. Mr. Kathleen Seidel was the one time administrator of web of hateful neurodiversity blogs called \"the autism hub\". In response to my email saying I did not believe he should link to blogs that made fun of disabled people and made unauthorized use of their photos, his response was to cc an email he wrote to this perpetrator with the words \"very funny\". I wish i had saved the email as normally I have reservations about publishing privately sent email. In this instance, I regret that this might be an exception to the rule. But you can take my word for it, Mr. Kathleen Seidel, did in fact find it amusing that someone would make fun of me and by extension all persons with developmental disabilities.Mr. Kathleen Seidel, when I wrote a blog post in which I questioned the wisdom of his wife, (whom I thought at the time owned the autism hub) for allowing a post from hateful persons who compared parents who supported autism speaks and wanted a cure for their children to members of the Ku Klux Klan who are forced to raise black children, responded that his wife had no control over the hub. When I asked him to explain to me why the hub would link to a blog that posted something like this, he said that he did not care what I thought of blogs on the hub and he did not have to justify anything to me. Perhaps, Mr. Kathleen Seidel supports this sort of bigotry as possibly does his wife, as a husband and wife will usually (though admittedly not always) agree on matters such as this.Though I don't have a high personal opinion of the Geiers and I don't agree with everything that is said in this article, it does make some valid points about Ms. Seidel and the ND movement and is worth reading.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bolenreport.com/Geier/KathleenSeidel.htm"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/06/interesting-article-about-grand-dame-of.html", "title": "\nInteresting article about grand dame of neurodiversity\n"},

It will be held in Syracuse, New York, home to Jim Sinclair, one of the founders of the ND movement.  This event is apparently an appetizer to that unsavory conclave of neurodiversity hatemongers, autreat, which will be held in Pennsylvania the following week.The event starts out with the definition of neurodiversity: Neurodiversity is a concept and social movement that advocates for viewing autism as a variation of human wiring, rather than a disease.  Other than using the word disease rather than disability, this unabashed definition is actually close to what neurodiversity is about, rather than what other disingenuous or confused persons try to present it as, such as a crusade for human rights.  Of course, it is unclear what the difference is between disability and disease, except that neurodiversity proponents offer the social model of disability by claiming that autism would not be disabling if society accommodated those with autism or the mothers of persons with autism who wish a cure weren't such god awful ogres who taught their children to hate themselves or gave them self-fulfilling prophecies as some of the more unsavory characters in the ND movement assert.  Of course, I still think Diane Sawyer's definition, a beautiful way of justifying heartbreak is as of yet the most spot on definition to date.The description of the event goes on:  neurodiversity activists reject the idea that autism should be cured,  advocating instead for celebrating autistic forms of communication and  self-expression,and for promoting support systems that allow autistic people to live as autistic people.This is the type of stuff that is so insulting to those of us who suffer from this disability every day.  I know this is a rehash of things I have said for years, but i get tired of reading this stuff.  I remember how John Best would make angry rants when people would say that autism should be celebrated.  Where here is another example of something that may cause Best to lose his temper.

{"date": " June 10, 2011", "body": "\nLately much has been made in the media about the new genetic findings that were published recently in the journal neuron, showing that there are many mutations on many different chromosomes that can cause autism.  I will qualify this post acknowledging I have not read the actual study but only the media reports, I am not an expert on genetics, so if any of my detractors want to comment on errors of reasoning or to attack me personally or whatever I will begin the post with that caveat.One of the significant things I have read about the study is that it seems to show that the vast majority of cases of autism come from spontaneous (denovo) mutations and are not inherited.  This contradicts the tenets of Temple Grandin who has claimed that eradicating autism would be a disaster and that autism genes have stayed in the population because they provide some sort of adaptive or evolutionary advantage in the way that sickle cell anemia genes have stayed in the population to fight malaria or genes for hemachromatosis have stayed to combat iron deficiencies.  She has claimed that autism is responsible for every invention from the spear to the computer to the cell phone.  Simon Baron-Cohen has made a similar claim that autism genes provide some sort of evolutionary adaption and this is the reason autism has stayed in the population.  He includes this in part of his arguments in stating that high functioning (though it is unclear where the demarcation between high and low functioning are from his writings) autism should not be considered a disability.  There are some problems with these arguments I have written about them elsewhere.  This study would seem to provide evidence against Grandin's and Baron-Cohen's arguments that autism genes are something good and have stayed in the general population due to adaptive status, but rather autism has stayed in the population because of denovo mutations. What of the arguments of Mark Blaxill and others who support ageofautism website and philosophy who believe that  the cause of most autisms were simply that something (such as vaccines) was introduced into the environment that did not exist previously (at least not in high numbers) and this has caused a huge spike in autism and if we could do research and isolate what this thing is, it would lead to solutions in the etiologies and treatments of this condition?  It would seem this research might reduce the credibility of their beliefs, though certainly they will have an explanation and this study or any other won't dissuade them. The neurodiversity movement has long espoused the dogma that genetic research into autism will result in prenatal testing and widespread abortions of autistic fetuses, possibly as soon as the next five years or less.  Will this study, showing in fact how complex and diverse the genetics of autism really are, lead to less credibility of this dogma. Ari Ne'eman who now has power to recommend policy or even vote on autism policy in two different government positions created at taxpayer expense has called for a ban on all research of this kind.  Yet Michael Wigler, one of the principal authors of this study,  has claimed that this research at some point may present treatment options for some kinds of autism or perhaps even a cure.

Interestingly enough, he seems to use those of us with autism as a pawn for his own political purposes.

Many are somebody\u2019s grandparents -- may be one of yours -- who wouldn\u2019t be able to afford nursing home care without Medicaid. Many are poor children.

{"date": " July 7, 2011", "body": "\nI read with interest about an article that suggests that there may be a causal relationship between the use of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) drugs in pregnant women and the likelihood of their giving birth to a child with autism. Apparently, in a group of women, there seemed to be an increase of about 3% in the risk of her having an autistic offspring than someone who either had no depression or other mental condition or a person with the condition who had not used SSRI drugs. Lead author and Kaiser Permanente epidemiologist Lisa Croen has stated that caution should follow interpretation of the results as they are preliminary and more research will have to be done to see if this could be something contributing to the etiology of autism.I tried to download the primary source and a commentary on it in the same journal. Unfortunately, they were behind a paywall and I could not obtain them for free. As far as I can tell, no reason how the SSRI could have caused the fetus to become autistic was given.Though I was unable to read the actual article itself, the story about it interested me for two reasons.First of all, my maternal grandmother suffered from severe depression well before the days of SSRI drugs. She underwent ECT and ultimately committed suicide at age 49 a couple of years before I was born. I suspect that her genetics may have been a factor in my disability, as well as some ADD traits in a couple of my cousins who are also her grandchildren. Though it sounds like Croen and colleagues did make some attempt to control for genetics of the mental illness, I can't help thinking that it was the mother's depression itself that caused a genetic predisposition to the autism, rather than the ingestion of the drugs being toxic to the fetus.The second reason the story piqued my interest was that some may remember that Lisa Croen's main claim to fame was her faux pas in publishing some interpretations from CDDS data that suggested to her that the reason for the greatly increased prevalence of autism was due to 100% diagnostic substitution of mental retardation for autism, claiming that there was a corresponding decrease in mental retardation diagnoses to the increase for autism diagnoses. The problem, apparently, with her interpretation was that she did not adjust for age of admission into the CDDS which was very different for persons with retardation than for autism. Mark Blaxill, well-known for his beliefs that vaccines caused his daughter and other children to become autistic, showed that she had misinterpreted her data. Croen later, admitted to the mistake. Whether or not this reduces the credibility of Croen's interpretations of the data in her current study I don't know.As many persons interested in autism now know, recently there was a study suggesting that the environment may play a greater role than thought in autism. Now that the vaccine hypothesis has been refuted in a variety of studies (regardless of whether or not these studies are in fact tobacco science as some die hard proponents of the vaccines-cause-autism camp state), there is apparently a temporal relationship (though not a casual relationship) in terms of a timeline between the advent of SSRI drugs and increases in autism diagnoses. I have shown elsewhere that there is not a temporal relationship between increases in thimerosal and increases in autistic persons admitted to the CDDS. Whether this is true for all vaccines, which don't contain thimerosal such as the MMR, which could factor into the equation, I don't know.The temporal relationships between introducing autism as a diagnostic category in 1991 under IDEA and then supreme court decisions favorable to those seeking services for their autistic children and increases in diagnoses have been largely ignored by the public interested in developmental disabilities which sees special education and the IDEA law as a quick fix for their kids problems.Is it possible that SSRI drugs will be the new factor that those who claim there has actually been an increase in autism will claim is responsible? I don't know. Only time will tell.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thirdage.com/news/autism-linked-to-ssri-antidepressant-use_07-07-2011", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/thimerosal.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/07/new-study-linking-ssris-and-autism.html", "title": "\nNew study linking SSRIs and autism\n"},
{"date": " July 14, 2011", "body": "\nThere has been some buzz in the autism blogosphere recently about that dirtiest of four letter words, cu**. (No, I'm not talking about a certain part of the female anatomy). Blogger Harold Doherty has recently written about his desire for a cure. Teenage anti-neurodiversity blogger, Oliver Canby, has stated that autism sucks and how much he wants a cure.I will write a third post about this, because I suffer everyday from the isolation of autism, the not being able to make a living and the inability to get things done during the day. The fine motor coordination problems that impair my handwriting as well as the irrational fear of birds. I had to attend special education schools for 8 years, as well as an after school tutoring program for a few years. I had to spend recess time at one school to receive tutoring for my handwriting. I was also a chronic bedwetter up until age 13. However, compared to some persons on the spectrum, I have it really good. There are others who engage in self-injurious behaviors, who cannot speak a word, can't dress themselves or take the bus anywhere and will require 24/7 care for the rest of their lives if no way is found to cure them.I hope that we can get a consensus of pro-cure people in the blogosphere to write posts how much they want a cure for this horrific disability and have more than three.In terms of finding a cure, we have a formidable uphill battle in that there are limited numbers of autistic brains available for autopsy, no good animal models for autism as well as the fact that autism is a description of many disorders with apparently a combination of genetic and environmental causes, all which make finding a cure or really advanced treatments a difficult task.In addition to these obvious disadvantages, we also have the public sector and private sector autism organizations who don't give a shit.Congress created the combating autism act, which had as its goal the curation of autism. It stipulated that at least one person on the autism spectrum must be appointed to the interagency autism coordinating committee, the government body that makes decisions as to how autism research can be best funded. To date, the two autistic members, Stephen Shore and Ari Ne'eman are opposed to curing autism. They are barely affected by their autism if at all. So far not a single pro-cure autistic person has ever been appointed a public member of the IACC.The government continues to fund rogue, Morton Gernsbacher, who claims that autism is a harmless condition and that severely autistic persons have made great contributions to the arts and sciences.John Elder Robin Hood-in-reverse also makes funding decisions at taxpayer expense, in spite of saying there is no need for a cure for autism on page five of his book, Look Me In The Eye.Autism speaks, one of the largest private funding bodies for autism research, has funded Laurent Mottron who states that autism is not a disorder but merely a difference. They also have John Elder Robison on their scientific advisory board. Not only is Robison the only member of that board without an M.D. or Ph.D. degree, he is also the only one who has not graduated high school.All of these things make the ultimate finding of a cure for autism a more difficult problem than it might be otherwise.Though I don't expect a cure to be found in my lifetime, I hope that in spite of these things that someday a cure will be found.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2011/07/cure-autism-absolutely.html", "http://autismisbad.blogspot.com/2011/07/being-autistic-sucks.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/07/yes-lets-find-cure.html", "title": "\nyes, let's find a cure\n"},
{"date": " July 19, 2011", "body": "\nAs most persons who are interested in autism know, the literature suggests that autism is far more common in boys than in girls. Ratios for males to females have generally been reported to be around 4:1. Ratios as high as 10:1 have been reported for the higher functioning types of autism.In spite of this fact, it would seem there is parity between the sexes or possibly even a greater number of females than males among autistic persons who are proponents of that deranged philosophy called neurodiversity. They sometimes claim to speak for all or most autistics stating \"we don't want to be cured\". Or Alex Plank's statement that \"autistics don't want to be cured\". It begs the question how they can speak for most or all autistics.Numerous females involved in the neurodiversity movement have claimed the numbers are artifacts, i.e. that girls are underdiagnosed as autistic due to certain types of societal constructs. Brenda Myles of autism asperger publishing company fame has claimed that some autistic girls are merely thought to be \"drama queens\" and don't get a diagnosis.I always thought that one possibility that would show that they were wrong was the fact that females have an extra x chromosome and thus could receive some protection against an x-linked disease or at least be less susceptible to it. I think Michael Wigler's research has suggested this line of thought. I will concede that my knowledge in the science of this area is limited.Of course, if autism were an exclusively x-linked disorder, then the ratios of males to females would be far higher than 4 to 1 or even 10 to 1 as they are in x-linked conditions such as hemophilia or pattern baldness. Also in some cases it is known that autism is caused by autosomal dominance, such as tuberous sclerosis and the sex chromosomes are not involved. Recently, there has been some research done which may provide empirical evidence refuting what the militant female neurodiversitites have been saying for years, and providing further evidence that they don't represent the vast majority of spectrumites in any sort of demographic. Valerie Hu and colleagues at George Washington University have discovered a gene, retinoic acid\u2013related orphan receptor-alpha (RORA), that interacts with sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone in the brain that could explain the sex ratios of autistics.RORA controls production of enzymes that convert testosterone into estrogen and the excess of testosterone in the brain may either cause autism or make a male more vulnerable to it. whereas estrogen may provide females protection against autism. This does not explain why some females do get autism, though and why when they do get autism their autism is often more severe than that in a male. Of course, this research could not only be the beginning of refuting one of the tenets of the neurodiversity propagandists and hatemongers but also perhaps giving us a breakthrough into the cause of autism. Only time will tell (cliche, I know).\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-autism-strikes-more-boys-than-girls"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/07/scientific-proof-autism-more-common-in.html", "title": "\nscientific proof autism more common in males?\n"},
{"date": " July 17, 2011", "body": "\nGadfly has just read a shout-out by neurodiversity ideologue Michelle Dawson. Apparently, some researchers at Stanford University have received a research grant funded by the NIH to study mathematical skills in high functioning autistic children. Naturally, Dawson neglects to state that these are all high functioning individuals in the study. she quotes the studies objectives:\"The long-term goal of our research is to better understand mathematical, analytic and logical reasoning abilities, and their neurobiological bases, in children and adults with autism. Our proposed studies will provide the first and most detailed analysis of mathematical skills and problem solving abilities in children with autism. Characterizing potentially intact cognitive abilities and areas of relative strength in children with autism is profoundly important not only for defining and more fully characterizing the nature of autism but also for facilitating academic and professional success.\" (emphasis added)In reading the source further from which Ms. Dawson quotes the researchers state about autism:However, its altered developmental trajectory can also lead to cognitive strengths, particularly in the domains of mathematical and analytical problem solving.The researchers then go on to contradict themselves stating:Despite its importance, numerical and mathematical reasoning is a grossly understudied cognitive domain in ASD. Here, we propose to initiate the first systematic study of mathematical cognition in children with ASD, focusing initially on children with High Functioning Autism (HFA)It is true, a small percentage of autistics have mathematical savant skills, but there is no evidence that this is the general case. I do know of the various studies of the raven's matrices done by Dawson and friends in which the control group was not a sample drawn from the general population but a self-selected sample of all males with IQs in the 70th percentile. I have seen that there are some studies showing sex differences in scores on raven's matrices, but i can't recall where. Also Isabelle Souleries study in which she engaged in a non-standard use of the Raven's as a timed test and only used high functioning individuals. No one, as far as I know have replicated their work on the Raven's with the higher functioning autistics. Sven Boelte's work has shown increases in lower functioning (those with IQs less than 85) scores in the Raven's but no effects in higher functioning. Kim Boddner's work (though not yet published but an IMFAR poster) has shown no effect of Raven's versus Weschler in higher functioning autistics.I also know of the studies involving \"attention to detail\" whatever that means, superior scores on the embedded figures tests, and superior scores on the block design test of some autistics, though admittedly have not read these studies.This is similar to the claims that Mottron made to secure his nearly half million dollar grant from autism speaks. That the results of his research would benefit autistics in that they would result in better employment and academic opportunities and better parenting for those with autism. To date, I have seen no evidence to suggest his work has resulted in these benefits for those with autism. I suspect the Stanford researchers don't have autism themselves, have never spent a day in a special education school and have not been fired from multiple jobs. So, they really don't know what causes autistics to have these problems. Their claim that somehow these math abilities can be harnessed in these kids and help mitigate the problems of autism is offensive to me. Assuming mathematical strengths could be utilized, it is still not going to solve the behavioral and social deficits that exist in autism that would prevent them from achieving their academic potential in a regular education setting or help them with the behavioral and social problems that would impair their ability to get and keep a job.Since apparently, this question has not yet been studied and as far as I can tell the authors show no evidence that high functioning autistics in general have these abilities, I will only be able to await and see the results of this study and the fruition it will bring.Gadfly is happy to report though that some good may actually come from this study. Dawson writes:Wonderful. Maybe I can retire now.Yes, Michelle, please do. Then we won't have to be exposed to the mammoth chip you have on your shoulder when anyone dares to disagree with you. We won't have to hear about autistics are not write-offs because of the research you and your buddies do and all the other baloney. Also, maybe your buddies, Souleries, Mottron and Gernsbacher can retire along with you, then maybe we can get funding of some sane people who will actually try to mitigate or even cure this horrible disorder.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8114489&icde=8921546"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/07/will-research-into-mathematical-ability.html", "title": "\nWill research into mathematical ability be the salvation of autistics?\n"},

According to this article, in May, several large corporations have approached ASAN trying to recruit autistic employees. Before this ASAN has been tapped for persons in government and public policy positions. These jobs apparently want college educated persons in the Washington, D.C. Metro area. A perusal of ASAN's website shows they fail to mention any information that was in this article. This seems odd, as I would think they would want to widely advertise this service if it had a chance of securing employment for those on the spectrum. For those who complain that Ne'eman and company are only interested in the high functioning end of the spectrum, they also state that they are contemplating a job service for those with autism who do not have college degrees. They state for parents that by the time their children reach employment age these services will likely be expanded.The article neglects to specifically name which corporations these are so Gadfly can attempt to verify this information. I am also skeptical that large corporations would go out of their way to recruit persons with autism in the worst economic times since the great depression, particularly the young 20 somethings who are usually affiliated with ASAN who have little to no actual job experience and dubious qualifications for jobs in computer technology, biology etc., the article specifically mentions. I am also wondering why ASAN would be contacted, given their low media profile, as compared to autism speaks or the autism society of America. I particularly question this as autism speaks has made an effort to encourage persons to employ autistics with their autism in the workplace public service announcements, yet has never employed any persons with autism in their organization nor, as far as I know contributed to the employment of a single autistic person, excepting this $25,000 grant they gave one vocational group. It would seem more likely that autism speaks would be contacted rather than the lesser known ASAN and AS would jump at an opportunity like this.I also wonder what industries in the Washington, D.C. area would employ computer technology people or biology persons. For these reasons, I wonder if these jobs really do exist. If I can find out more details about this or any further developments occur, I'll let readers know.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismkey.com/advocacy-group-boosts-autism-employment-prospects/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/07/ari-neeman-goes-into-employment-agency.html", "title": "\nAri Ne'eman goes into the employment agency business\n"},

I have written 23 short stories, 14 of them have been published on my stories page. It has been a few years since I have written any stories, though at some point I might write more. I'm more interested in writing novels and technically I have now written two of those. Of course short stories can often be a novelist's baby steps. I have submitted my story, Guess who isn't coming to lunch to these people. I may submit one or two more to them. They have a 3,000 word limit so this would preclude a good number of my stories that are substantially longer than this but I have a number of others that do fall within this range.At one time I believed that I was one of the few persons on the spectrum to have written fiction. After I wrote this on my home page of my stories website, various people countered this claim and I must concede that there are apparently more fiction authors on the spectrum than I previously had believed.This seems like an exciting project, the fact that there could be a collection of short stories by autistic authors and that it could be published. One of the problems with this project however is that these people are planning to submit the collection to Jessica Kingsley, probably the premiere publisher of autism-related books. I met Ms. Kingsley at an autism conference a few years ago or so, and she told me that as a general rule, she will not publish fiction books because they did publish one children's book that was fiction and it sold poorly. Though, I think such a project would be worthwhile, I understand that Ms. Kingsley is concerned with her company's bottom line. So, I am guessing the chances that this story collection would be published by JKP is certainly a longshot. If JKP declined to publish it, the chances of anyone else doing so are miniscule, as short story collections are only published by mainstream publishers when the author is an established writer who has had stories published in various magazines, anthologies etc.If any other autistic authors who have written short stories are interested in this I guess they can follow the link to the wrong planet post and contact the parties concerned.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt151627.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/02/possible-autistic-short-story.html", "title": "\nPossible autistic short story collection\n"},

This is it, folks, countdown to Armageddon.If this act does not pass, the IACC will cease to exist and it's six public members won't have a platform to stand on. Lynn Redwood will no longer be able to pontificate at taxpayer expense that Mercury is the cause of autism and thimerosal is the most likely culprit. Never mind that study after study has refuted what she said. For another ten days, the government will still pay for her pontification as well as paying for the IOM's study and conclusions that there is not a snowball's chance in hell that mercury and thimerosal caused an autism epidemic. The state of California paid for Schecter's and Grether's study, showing no relationship between thimerosal and autism after this substance was phased out of vaccines. They could have read gadfly's controversial piece on the subject and saved the taxpayers of the u.s.a. and California some hard earned dough.The law stated that one person on the spectrum must serve as a public member. Though the law stated that the objective was to ultimately cure autism, we have two anti-cure autistics, Stephen Shore and Ari Ne'eman who are barely affected by their autism, if at all. To date, no pro cure autistic has been appointed a public member of the IACC. In fact Ari Ne'eman is opposed to this act, yet serves on the governmental board this law authorized, what irony! Only ten more days to Armageddon. Ne'eman won't be able to recommend that autistics can be employed if only social pleasantry is eliminated as a criteria for hiring and evaluating people's job performances. In fact he might have more time on his hands and perhaps he can get his first paid job. For another ten days the government will also have to finance his lecturing an economist on the evils of committing eugenics by daring to come up with a cost analysis study showing the expense of autism to society, then we have the countdown to Armageddon. Ari will be able to publicly laugh, declaring victory, but privately crying boo hoo, that his power as a public member of the IACC that he so covets has been taken away from him.It's coming down to the wire, the tension is building. Only ten more days, will congress pass this law or won't it? Will Barack Obama sign it? Perhaps he will ponder a veto once it comes across his desk. After all, how can Mr. Obama sign such legislation stating that he wants to combat autism in good conscience. After all, his administration has appointed an individual to two government posts relating to autism who has made it clear that he believes curing autism would be morally reprehensible. Of course, there is the alternative way of combating autism. Some of us can be strangled to death and turned into cat food, or alternatively we can be taken out, lined up against the wall and be shot. after all, this was a policy recommendation of one of mr. Ne'eman's most ardent supporters since Mr. Ne'eman has not repudiated the statement or this individual, Gadfly wonders if he feels this way or if Mr. Obama who appointed him to these posts does too. After all, in this same post, this individual stated that those of us who have autism and want a cure are only standing in the way of noble self-advocates because we are a bunch of welfare bums who won't look for work or take responsibility for our lives, so taking this recommendation would save the taxpayers money. it would take a two-thirds vote of both houses of congress to override an Obama veto in the event that it happened. Would this happen? If not, we have ten days countdown to Armageddon.Whether or not this law is reauthorized, the status quo won't be changed in other aspects. John Robison, a high school dropout with no training or knowledge in autism and science, will still be able to review government grant proposals at taxpayer expense. Now the government has an autistic person who states he is a stakeholder though tacitly admitting he has no disability of any kind. Thanks to Robison's federal appointment, or whatever it is, we are no longer disenfranchised. Hallelujah! praise the lord!Morton Gernsbacher, a woman who does not believe autism is a disease, will still get funding from the Center for Disease Control to carry out her research. She will be able to get this funding even though she trivializes a serious disability by claiming Richard Borcherds and Vernon Smith are autistic. I have dealt with the problems of Gernsbacher's argument elsewhere. My tax dollars will still go to this woman who writes essays with so many factual errors, rather than giving it to me in the form of disability that i have been trying to get for more than four years so i can buy a new car to replace my 16 year old Honda accord.Well folks, ten more days until the countdown to possible Armageddon if this law is not renewed.Addendum: Word is out from the autism society of america that the house has passed the combating autism act.

{"date": " August 14, 2011", "body": "\nI see there is an interesting new article from Morton Gernsbacher and two of her friends. This article deals with a rather unoriginal and cliched topic, the lack of visibility of autistic adults. This is nothing new in fact I wrote a piece dealing with this issue about eight years ago, in which I bemoaned the fact that the existence of autistic adults is largely ignored. In addition to Gernsbacher, one of the authors is Bev Harp, a well-known neurodiversity ideologue and at least one time part of that unsavory clique of neurodiversity bloggers called \"the autism hub\". The third author is one Jennifer L. Stevensonwho apparently until recently was a graduate student at the university of Wisconsin who studied under Gernsbacher.\r\rThough Gernsbacher(and by extension one of her grad students)is not one of my favorite people, she and the other two authors do bring up some valid points about how autistic adults and some of the problems we have is largely ignored and how the problems of childhood are portrayed by the media. They neglect to bring up the fact that perhaps one reason adults are ignored is that no one wants to acknowledge the poor prognosis that most of us will have. This is especially true for neurodiversity proponents such as Gernsbacher and company.\r\rThey trivialize what is a very bad disability by claiming that terms such as \"suffering from\" is belittling language. Yes, I suffer from autism, it is not belittling I really do have this disability and suffer from it every day. Only one of the three authors (Ms. Harp) alleges to have autism and she apparently is someone extremely high functioning who was able to enroll in a social work graduate program, so certainly the fact that many of us do suffer tremendously from this brain disease is certainly an abstraction to these individuals.\r\rThey write:\r\rAutistic children are further mythologized to lack awareness of their situations and surroundings; indeed, the very idea that they might be embarrassed or offended by being used as pawns in pity-driven fundraising campaigns is often dismissed by the very parents who consider themselves autism \"advocates.\" Children, therefore, present the face of choice for virtually all autism support societies and most autism charities.\r\r\rI am indeed impressed by the omniscience of Gernsbacher, Stevenson and Harp in knowing that autistic children (every one of them) is embarrassed by the use of their images in \"pity-driven\" fundraising. No, it is not possible that these people are trying to get help for their severely sick and crippled kids. It does not matter that the neurodiversity movement used the murder of Katie McCarron and the dumb remarks made by Allison Singer about driving off a bridge with her kid as pawns in their crusade to express their hatred and lies and propaganda, claiming that those of us who wish a cure for ourselves or our offspring are somehow responsible for murder.\r\rThey go on to cite Brugha's flawed study for proof that there are equal numbers of autistic adults to autistic children. I believe it is possible that autistic adults exist in the same numbers of persons born in more recent birth years, but admittedly definitive proof is lacking and may not be feasible to acquire. One must remember the old cliche about looking for a needle in a haystack.\r\rThey go on to cite the dismal prospects of most autistic adults (both future and present), certainly ironic in light of decrying the use of pity in fundraising.\r\rMost concerning of all to this blogger, is their comments about autism in the workplace. They talk of \"Jack\", an autistic man whom they state is an efficient computer technician. In spite of Jack's skill in a rather marketable profession, he \"loses out\" on various jobs due to inappropriate attire, inability to look people in the eye and reticence in interviews. \r\rThey write the concerning statement:\r\rEmployers lack the knowledge and resources to support an employee like Jack. They have, after all, like the rest of contemporary society, been inundated with rhetoric asserting that autistic children must either be cured or suffer a lifetime as unemployable burdens. Rarely has the alternative\u2014a capable autistic adult needing appropriate workplace supports\u2014been presented. Scarce resources will not be directed toward such an unidentified need.\r\rAs someone who spent many years struggling in the workplace and suffering from these problems first-hand, I believe I have some knowledge about this and I wonder how capable Jack truly is and assuming so, if there are any supports that will be helpful to him or make a difference in his employability. I am certain this is not the case for myself. That part of my problem was an inability to do a job as competently as a nonhandicapped person due to my own disability. I am certainly skeptical that Gernsbacher and colleagues really have valid answers. \r\rI seem to remember Bev Harp had some sort of job, prior to studying social work, but what of Gernsbacher and Stevenson? Do they have the knowledge to support someone like Jack? Gernsbacher's professions have been high school teacher and then college professor. She has lived in a lifetime in an ivory tower with essentially no practical business experience. From looking at Stevenson's website, she is an extremely young (probably no older than 30) graduate student who as recently as 2002 was a college undergraduate. As far as I can tell she has no real work or world experience outside of academic psychology. They claim that no cure is needed for Jack and if employers would somehow accommodate his disability he would be fine. Based on my own experiences in the workplace I am certainly skeptical of this. I don't believe inappropriate attire would make a difference for a computer tech. If he were highly skilled reticence in interviews would make no difference. In the days when I was applying for work as a medical transcriptionist, I was rarely asked extensive interview questions, but prospective employers were interested in assessing my skill for the job. While it is true, that some employers might have prejudices against Jack due to some quirks, if he were truly a competent computer tech, he would be able to work someplace. I did keep a number of transcription jobs for fair amounts of time. Though I suffered some discrimination in the workplace, competence was certainly an issue in my case. \r\rThey also speak of an autistic woman named \"Jill\" who loses jobs due to making \"animal noises\" in meetings with clients. They go on to claim that the employer should completely overlook Jill's behavior, no matter how disruptive it is. Of course, we have heard this before from Ari Ne'eman, who at 21 years of age and never having had paid employment in his life stated that social pleasantry should be eliminated as a criteria for evaluating people for hiring or ability to do a good job. It is quite clear that these three authors (certainly Gernsbacher and Stevenson) are equally naive about the minutiae in the workplace as Ne'eman. \r\rWhile I am somewhat gratified these three have brought attention to the lack of visibility of autistic adults, I don't believe it is helpful for them to claim people who want to help themselves or their children are invoking in pity as if it were a bad thing. I think it is even less helpful for them to propose simplistic quick fixes in the workplace for adults with autism, when they themselves have so little experience in the real working world. \r\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dsq-sds.org/article/view/1675/1596", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/invisible.html", "http://psych.wisc.edu/gradstudies/gradstudents/stevenson/index.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/08/interesting-piece-from-gernsbacher-and.html", "title": "\ninteresting piece from Gernsbacher and friends\n"},

When Silberman asked him if others with autism should be included in these roles Robison responded:\r\rYes. I have argued for having more autistic people on the boards, but it\u2019s not obvious to me who those people would be. I don\u2019t have a lot of personal knowledge of autistic people with an interest in science. Most of the people in the autism community who are critical of the policies of these various groups are not people with any real interest in science, or at least they don\u2019t express the interest in their writing that I can see. Without an interest in science, they don\u2019t have an obvious fit with the boards.\r\rIn the comments section, Michelle Dawson seemed to take umbrage at Robison\u2019s remarks. She is an individual with autism who has published journal articles and has obviously taken a great interest in science of autism. In fact she has taken such a strong interest in science, we have seen that she is not above accepting charity from persons who she says \"make her sick\" and from an organization she claims ideally wishes a short future for autistic persons in order to carry out her scientific endeavors.\r\rI was struck by this because I think of my own interest in the science of autism.\r\rI have on occasion written posts dealing with scientific issues and I know Robison reads this blog. However, I have not written on these issues frequently. One of the reasons is that though I have an interest in scientific issues in autism, my disability has impaired me from pursuing them as vigorously as I could and obtaining the needed expertise to write decent blog posts on the subject.\r\rI did not realize that I had an organic impairment in my brain until adolescence when the individual who was my psychologist at the time discussed these issues with me.\r\rNot long after this, while in community college in the mid 1970s, I took an interest in this and I took a course in physiological psychology as well. After this, I tried to read whatever I could about the brain and later about autism. I read some more physiological psychology textbooks and purchased A.R. Luria\u2019s The working brain. I wanted to major in psychobiology after I transferred to UCLA but had to settle for an undergraduate psychology degree due to getting C minuses in a couple of science courses. There was also the question of whether doing stereotactic surgery on animals would be too difficult for me. I had no idea at the time that MRI scans would be invented. I was crushed when one of the psychiatrists who evaluated me for autism noted that at age 21 I had essentially never had a job (or at least no job where taxes and social security were withhold). He took it upon himself to give me some vocational counseling. He asked me what I wanted to be. When I told him I wanted to be a brain researcher he stated, \"You\u2019re going to have to settle for something less than what you want to be.\" He suggested \"manual labor\" as an alternative career whatever that means. I never dreamed the irony that would take place more than three decades later when I would read Morton Gernsbacher\u2019s extremely offensive piece with the multiple factual errors which I wrote about previously where she talks about autistics participating as researchers and the cavalier attitude she takes towards individuals such as myself who are too impaired to be scientists.\r\rAfter college I continued to try to read about the brain and science in order to figure out what the defect was that had made my life so difficult. I read articles in various journals, such as the autopsy studies done by Williams et. al. that found problems in the cerebella of autistics, as well as postmortem reports done by Edward Ritvo and Margaret Bauman and Tom Kemper. It was very hard for me to concentrate and learn much more. My constant desire for twiddling (self-stimulation) coupled by my executive functioning problems made this a formidable task and I was unable to achieve the expertise in science and autism which I coveted.\r\rA few years later, I read the study that Eric Courchesne had published in the New England journal of medicine on the smaller size of lobules VI-VII of the cerebellar vermis. I wanted to be his research subject. I got my wish and talked shop with him. I asked him a variety of questions and he seemed somewhat impressed with my limited knowledge. I wrote about this elsewhere as well.\r\rAll of this had been consummated by the spring of 1989, still some years before either Michelle Dawson or John Robison would take any interest in autism or receive their respective diagnoses.\r\rIn addition to having my autism and the constant desire to twiddle (self-stimulate) be disorganized and have a hard time applying myself, I was sidetracked in other ways as well. There were various times that I worked 40 hours or more a week. I also took an interest in learning computer programming. I became interested in fiction reading and writing and wanted to be a novelist. I succeeded in writing two (albeit non-publishable) novels. This, exacerbated by my disability, made it difficult to pursue my interest in science that Robison does not seem to think I have. He apparently has never read my essay which I linked to above. I also took an interest in more leisurely pursuits including poker, horse race wagering, tennis and skiing. I wanted to have a happy life with good times in spite of my disability.\r\rOther things took place as well, the amount of research done on autism skyrocketed. It was hard to keep up. An ugly cult of vicious hatemongers called neurodiversity came to the fore. These despicable people appear to believe that persons with autism are better off being crippled and sick than being a healthy individual. I felt that I had to do research and work in order to outwit these people. The results are my article urging people to reject this philosophy as well as multiple posts on this blog. I will let readers judge how much I have succeeded in opposing these people.\r\rOver the years, I have never forgotten my interest in the science of autism and the brain that could have the potential to find out what causes these problems and how they could be mitigated or cured. I hope to one day read more books and study more journal articles, but in sum, my disability and other things in my life have made that pursuit difficult if not impossible. Even though I lack abilities because of my disability, I still have the interest.\r\rDoes Robison believe I would be a poor fit on a scientific advisory board? I am not sure of the answer to that.\r\rIs Robison himself a good fit? He is a high school dropout serving on the autism speaks advisory board where everyone else has an M.D. or Ph.D. He has made questionable statements on what has caused a rise in prevalence. He has suggested geek success as a legitimate scientific endeavor, which I took him to task on. He has shown ignorance rather than erudition in these statements.\r\rThe reason Robison gives for certain autistics not being a good fit is their dearth of writing on scientific subjects. What of Robison himself? How much has he written about the science of autism anywhere? In his books or in his blog posts?\r\rAs far as I can discern, with the exception of writing about his experiences in some TMS studies that Lindsay Oberman was doing and the post where he suggested geek success and one other thing as scientific endeavors, Robison has never written any commentary on the science of autism, how science could be advanced to help autistic people or suggestions how research could be pursued or funded. It seemed he was more interested in making money for himself and helping out his son through autism speaks\u2019 largess than he was in using that money to help others much less fortunate than himself or ways in which science could help mitigate the hardships of autism. If someone can point me to where Robison has contributed to or written anything about the science of autism other than the aforementioned examples, I would be gratified if they would comment on this blog post or send me an email.\r\rPerhaps most germane of all is the question of whether the person who wants to influence the direction of research is a legitimate stakeholder of any sort. Is he a person who himself is afflicted with autism or is he the parent of one? Though Robison has a son who he says is on the spectrum, it would appear his son is minimally affected if at all. On his own autism another statement he makes in the interview particularly stands out:\r\rEven though I\u2019m not a disabled person by any means today, I would say that the social challenge is a characteristic of disability that I have not been able to overcome. I\u2019ve only been able to circumvent it a bit and do my best with it. That\u2019s OK, but if you ask me what the hardest thing for me is about autism, that\u2019s absolutely it. \r\rWe seem to have a tacit admission on Robison\u2019s part that he has no disability whatsoever. Claiming he has social challenges that he was able to circumvent a bit seems a stretch for a man able to marry now three times, have a son, start all those successful businesses and write a best selling memoir. If Robison is not disabled by his ASD then why does he merit a diagnosis at all, let alone presenting himself as a stakeholder at government expense as well as the expense to those who donated time and money to autism speaks?\r\rAs far as being a good fit for scientific advisory boards it would seem that Robison is the squarest of pegs trying to be placed into the roundest holes by any standards.\r\rI hope that perhaps someday, if I continue to blog, that I can write more frequently on scientific issues in autism as well as a higher quality of posts that I have written in the past. However, my disability, (but not lack of interest), may preclude me from doing so.\r\rWhy can\u2019t we have pro-cure autistics who are actually affected by this disability as stakeholders in both governmental funding (given that the government has declared curation and prevention as public policy decisions vis-a-vis the combating autism act) as well as organizations such as autism speaks who claim that their goal is the curation and prevention of autism?\rWould I be a better fit on a scientific advisory board than Robison? I don\u2019t know the answer to that question. However, I don\u2019t think I would be any worse and don\u2019t see how I could be.\r\u3000\r\u3000\r\r\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2011/05/18/woof-john-elder-robison-living-boldly-as-a-free-range-aspergian/", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/corc.html", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/08/does-john-elder-robison-understand.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/09/having-interest-in-science-but-not.html", "title": "\nhaving an interest in science but not the ability\n"},
{"date": " September 28, 2011", "body": "\nI see that one of my favorite scientific reviewers of both public sector research grant proposals for autism research and proposals by people seeking funding from autism speaks is at it again. John Elder Robison is curious as to why the ratio of autistic males to autistic females is so high.As regular readers of my blog know,i discussed this in a recent blog post.Robison in the past has made questionable statements about causes of increases in autism prevalence, for example suggesting that a good portion of the increase could come from the rare condition chronic disintegrative disorder. He has also suggested studying geek success as a legitimate scientific endeavor to help ameliorate the problems of autistic persons.When I find it inconceivable that Mr. R can't top himself in his brilliant theories and suggestions to help understand and help those with autism, he never ceases to amaze me with what has to be his most astute observation ever. On speculating as to why the ratio of autistic males to autistic females is so high Mr. Robison writes:One explanation is that some parents have a son with autism and stop having children. So the girls that might even the male/female ratio are never born. I think that explanation may be true today, but what about the ages before modern birth control?That's an interesting idea, however, I do have one question. Previously in his post Robison conceded that there is a 50/50 chance of a baby being born either a boy or a girl. So I wonder why parents could not have a daughter as their first born with autism and then stop having other children after their daughter is born? In that case the ratio of autistic females to males would be 4:1 or higher.If Robison's theory were to have any credibility it would mean that at least four times as many boys are born than girls. If that were true there would be plenty of typical males who would have trouble finding mates the way autistics do and not as many babies would be born and over population would not be such a problem. Yet he contradicts this notion previously in the post by saying just as many males are born as females.I would be very interested in hearing Robison's explanation as to why this theory would only apply to first born sons rather than first born daughters, must be a doozy.I can't think of how well I'll sleep at night, as a former taxpayer, knowing that someone who is so brilliant is reviewing government research grants to decide what sort of autism research is funded at my expense.The persons who donated money to autism speaks with autistic children who will never make a six figure income, get married or write a best selling memoir will certainly be secure in knowing that an individual that thinks things through so clearly is working so hard to see the right research is funded by this stellar organization.The rumor mill has it that now that the combating autism act will be renewed after the formality of Obama signing the bill into law that Mr. Robison will be the third public member on the spectrum, alongside Stephen Shore and Ari Ne'eman on the IACC. I wonder what other brilliant suggestions he will make in this capacity. I'm wondering if he can possibly top this one, that would seem quite a formidable task.He concludes the post by saying:It would be very interesting to see a study that addressed this question. Perhaps a grad student somewhere will read this, and bring a research proposal to our next review meeting . . . .Stranger things have happened.Yes, I do agree with Robison here. Stranger things have happened. Like a certain high school dropout I know getting to review scientific grant proposals along with all of these M.D. and Ph.D. scientists.Addendum: I see that autism speaks has posted Mr. R's post on their blog they have certainly once again shown their credibility as a fund raising organization.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://jerobison.blogspot.com/2011/09/surplus-of-males.html", "http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2011/09/28/a-surplus-of-males/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/09/john-robisons-interesting-theory-on.html", "title": "\nJohn Robison's interesting theory on male/female sex ratios in autism\n"},

{"date": " October 12, 2011", "body": "\nI see that everybody's favorite autism funding organization, autism speaks, has awarded nearly two million in grants to various research projects designed to help mitigate some of the challenges in life that those of us on the spectrum have. One common complaint of many affected by autism is the lack of funding for studies involving problems in adulthood. So one study in particular caught my eye.Lindee Morgan, a psychologist in Florida, plans to study a social skills training protocol that deals with job interview techniques. On reading the last paragraph about the rationale of the study, it is unclear to me whether or not the study's purpose is to actually help autistics with their interviewing skills so they can more easily obtain employment:Because this experimental treatment targets the job interview context, one aim is to evaluate whether ISC increases in targeted social communication skills, changes in adaptive behavior, and quality of life variables. Further positive changes in mental health status as a result of ISC will also be explored.On reading this pedantically written paragraph, it is unclear to me what the purpose or rationale of this study is, period.As has been previously mentioned, with the exception of the funding of Alex Plank's trashy autism talk TV videos and John Robison pocketing some of the cash from this endeavor, not a single person with autism, to the best of my knowledge, has ever had a paid job at autism speaks in any capacity. Gadfly wonders why more than one hundred grand could not be spent to employ some persons with autism in this stellar organization that claims to care so much about us rather than on this study with questionable and vague aims from reading the grant material on AS' website.I concede that my expertise in most areas is limited to nonexistent. One subject I do have extensive knowledge in with nearly 28 years of actual experience, is interviewing and applying for jobs as an individual with an ASD. Though I managed to get some jobs where I was extensively interviewed, I often had a hard time due to body language, lack of eye contact and other issues. Also, the fact I had a bachelors degree in psychology and not pursuing a career in this area was also a liability that prospective employers sometimes commented on. My problems are probably not as overt on first blush as numerous others on the spectrum are. So, I was briefly able to \"pass\" for \"a normal person\".At some jobs, the interview was not so important as assessing my ability to type for various data entry and other types of jobs where nimble fingers were an asset. In spite of my poor fine motor coordination in handwriting, I can type more than 80 words a minute and this helped. When I became more experienced in medical transcription and applied for jobs in that field, prospective employers scarcely interviewed me. They gave me tests, as someone's skill in MT is rather easy to assess to see whether or not they could make the cut before hiring them.Upon being hired, getting the job was only half the battle. Keeping it was another story. After my problems (as said before not perceivable as first blush) came to the fore, such as funny movements, loud voice, inability to get along with some people, I was terminated from some jobs. Also, in spite of the testing process, my inability to later concentrate on the work and avoid making an excessive amount of careless errors cost me other jobs. My ability, or lack of it, in the interview process was certainly not a major factor in my employment problems.I concede I can't speak for others on the spectrum completely but I suspect the situation is at least somewhat similar, if not identical, for many of them. Assuming this treatment successfully teaches them how to interview for a job, will they be able to keep a job after the interview? What about training for a job, such as teaching someone computer programming skills, plumbing, etc. I suspect that a number of the subjects involved in this study have no marketable skills or at least paid experience in any sort of profession that is in high demand. Therefore, they will be forced to look for unskilled work, such as a picker in a warehouse (my first job after college) or a ditch digger, etc, or any other minimum wage job you can think of.I know from my experience that ironically enough, the unskilled jobs are sometimes the most difficult ones for a person on the spectrum to keep. After all, with more than 9% unemployment nationwide, including people who come to this country illegally from Mexico or other countries, the pool of unskilled labor is quite high and if an employer does not like someone due to behavior or poor work performance, they are easily replaced with someone else.I wonder, for these reasons, if spending more than one hundred grand on a study to teach autistics job interview skills is money well spent. I am inclined to think not. Of course, there may be something that I am missing in this assessment.Somehow, when I think of an organization that would give a man a half a million dollar grant who states that autism does not have the scientific status of a disease and that autistics are not dysfunctional only different and has a certain tenth grade dropout on their scientific advisory board, I am at least somewhat inclined to think this is another example of money poorly spent and a bad funding decision.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-10/as-asa101111.php", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/science/grants/social-pragmatic-treatment-adults-autism-spectrum-disorder-interview-skills-curriculu?destination=science%2Fgrant-search%2Fresults%2Ffield_grant_year%3A2011%3Fpage%3D1"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/10/is-more-than-100-grand-to-teach-job.html", "title": "\nis more than 100 grand to teach job interview skills to autistics worth it?\n"},
{"date": " November 3, 2011", "body": "\nMany people probably remember the well-known television commercial that aired regularly in 1984 for Wendy's hamburgers where the old woman asks, \"where's the beef?\" This expression certainly rings true in 2011 where we see that rogue autism researcher Laurent Mottron is at it again, claiming that being autistic is an advantage and not a flaw that needs to be corrected. He claims that autistics can make significant contributions to society in \"the right environment\" but largely fails to elaborate on what this could be, except alluding to Michelle Dawson and others with autism who work in his lab.Dr. Mottron's research has focused on differences between autistics and typicals in detecting sounds, embedded figures, superiority in such things as musical pitch and ability to perform on the block design test on the Wechsler IQ test. How these skills could possibly relate to being able to perform in a scientific milieu is unclear to me. This hits hard with me personally as I wished to be an autism brain researcher in the hopes of finding what in the brain causes autism but was too impaired to do it.The rationale given by autism speaks for awarding nearly half a million bucks in funding to this man stated that these strengths he studied could be applied to employment and other issues. In fact Dr. Mottron states:Too often, employers don\u2019t realize what autistics are capable of, and assign them repetitive, almost menial tasks,\u201d said Mottron. \u201cBut I believe that most are willing and capable of making sophisticated contributions to society, if they have the right environment.\u201dI believe if an autistic person is capable of doing well in any field of endeavor, whether it be medical transcription, computer programming or plumbing, they could demonstrate this capability and the employer would be happy to employ them and not assign them menial tasks. Dr. Mottron also does not account for the behavioral problems of autism which would certainly be a weakness. If an autistic person lost their temper or groped women in the workplace (two reasons I know of for two others on the spectrum besides myself to have been terminated from jobs), they would not care what this person was capable of. Whatever strengths Dr. Mottron alleges autistics have would be cancelled out by the weaknesses in behavior or social skills, resulting in a zero sum or negative outcome in terms of job capability.Of course, Dr. Mottron, in the media reported articles on his recent commentary in the medical journal, Nature, neglects to mention that a lot of his research mainly focuses on extremely high functioning autistic individuals and not on nonverbal lower functioning autistic individuals who have behavioral problems that might preclude them from being research subjects in an fMRI scanner.Another problem is that we must question the interpretations of some of the data of Dr. Mottron and his colleagues. In fact as recently pointed out by MJ of the autism jabberwocky blog Dr. Mottron and his colleagues may either be ignorant of even the most rudimentary skills of interpreting statistical data or disingenuously represent data from at least one of their studies into something that it is not.MJ wrote:So when the second paper says this in the results section -\"The Asperger adults demonstrated an advantage of RPM over Wechsler FSIQ that was significantly greater than that of the non-Asperger adult controls, Mann-Whitney U=366.5, p<.01\"That statement is completely unsupported by the data. In pure numerical terms, the difference might seem to be larger, but in terms of actual increased of intelligence that statement is very much in doubt.Another quibble with the results is the use of averages (means) to represent the group rather than a median. If you have a set of non-linear values such as these percentiles, if really isn't valid to take an average because it is going to misrepresent where the middle of the group is. That goes double when the data is badly skewed, as is the case of the Asperger adults' Raven's test in the second paper. In that case the \"average\" was 74 but the standard deviation is 50(!). For that to happen, the bulk of the data has to be well below the 74th percentile which means the median value would be significantly lower.So, in the Mottron group's recent paper on superiority of those with Asperger's syndrome on the Raven's matrices test we see that the mean score was 74th percentile but the standard deviation was nearly 50 (not quite 50 as MJ stated but very close). This means the data did not follow a normally distributed bell curve but were rather heavily skewed to one side or were bimodally distributed making the mean value of 74th percentile meaningless.A simpler explanation may be in order. To use an analogy, let's say there were 100 people on an island. if 45 of them were 8 feet tall, 45 of them were 4 feet tall and 10 of them were 6 feet tall, you would be technically correct in stating that the average height of the islanders was six feet. But it would certainly be misleading to say that the islanders were typically 6 feet tall.I have to wonder if other data from the Mottron group is interpreted in a similar fashion. Perhaps there is a much smaller sub group of autistics that has extremely superior skills in embedded figures, detecting pitch, etc. and another sub group that has greatly inferior skills with a few just in the middle. I admit I don't know the answer to that, but knowing about how different autistics can be from one another and the way the Mottron group interpreted their data in at least one study we can't really rule that out as a possibility.So to date, there is questionable evidence that all or even a large subset of autistics has these superior skills that will allegedly help them achieve educational goals and job placement. To the best of my knowledge, Mottron has never given any evidence of correlations or relationships to these skills enabling success or answered why the negatives of behavioral and poor social skills would not cancel these out. Again I must ask you, Dr. Mottron, where's the beef?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7371/full/479033a.html", "http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/10/critical-look-at-level-and-nature-of.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/11/dr-mottron-is-at-it-again-but-wheres.html", "title": "\nDr. Mottron is at it again but where's the beef?\n"},
{"date": " October 28, 2011", "body": "\nI see that U.S. News and World Report has published an interesting article on employment problems for those with autism.  It rightly points out that this is the time supportive services from the pie-in-the-sky promises but shit-from-the-sewer delivery from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act end and the autistic person has to go out and face the cruel world. The article states:  people with autism were only about half as likely to be working as  people with disabilities in general (33 percent compared with 59  percent). If true, this means that having autism is a worse disability than most are in  terms of employability.  Of course, I am skeptical about statistics that are casually bandied around.  The article interviews a professor named Scott Standifer who makes a statement that Ari Ne'eman should read:   \"We forget how important social relationships are in maintaining employment.\"  For those who may not have read previous blog entries I have written, Ari Ne'eman is an individual in his early 20's who is an autism self-advocate who has never had paid employment of any kind who says that social pleasantry should be eliminated in the workplace as a criteria for evaluating new hires and job evaluations. After this though, the article goes on to state that the lunch break is one of the more difficult things for persons with autism and the mandatory social requirement.  I think of all the times in the days years ago, when I worked outside my home and usually ate lunch alone at a restaurant or bought something off a roach coach and was never required to socialize with anyone, so this is rather silly.  The last 9 years or so that I worked I worked at home, so this was not an issue.  Finding a job you can do at home may make some of the social problems we face easier.  I realize this is probably not a feasible option for most on the spectrum, as it was for me for a time. The article offers an opium-induced dream:  Families of people with autism as well as employers and co-workers can  all help to make the employment experience a positive one for these  individuals.  This is never going to happen.  The sad truth is the world does not accommodate autistics and their families for their own convenience, regardless of what neurodiversity advocates think will happen.  Though I have been out of the workforce for a while, this must ring even more true with nearly 10% unemployment nationwide. Without going into the further specifics, (the interested individual can read the above-linked article) some rather pat solutions are given as well as certain jobs that autistics are supposedly good at. The article is of interest to me as an individual on the spectrum with nearly 28 years experience of utter hell attempting to make a living with a fair amount of success.  Though I'm retired now at a relatively young age, I will never forget those struggles.  I now had to stoop to applying for disability which I probably won't get.  I have contacted a new lawyer and have yet to hear from them and the deadline for filing a suit in federal court expires soon.  It's probably not worth contacting any other attorneys and I'm probably going to have to drop the case, so it goes.I wish there was a quick fix way of helping persons on the spectrum find and keep jobs but unfortunately there is none.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2011/10/28/job-market-tough-for-young-adults-with-autism?PageNr=1"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/10/interesting-article-on-tough-job-market.html", "title": "\nInteresting article on tough job market for autistics\n"},
{"date": " November 1, 2011", "body": "\nToday is autistics speaking day, which MJ of the autism jabberwocky bloghas commented on. I'm not sure whether or not MJ's percentages of higher functioning who are capable of communicating versus lower functioning unable to communicate are accurate. A significant portion of the reported increase in prevalence, I suspect, is because of increased awareness that autism can exist in persons of normal or above average intelligence. However, that may be neither here nor there. MJ does make some excellent points in this post about how the number of autistics unable to communicate or who may not have the inclination or education or both to write blog posts are not being represented.Another problem is that one of the dirty tricks of the neurodiversity movement is to have members log on using different identities to give the impression that more persons with autism share their view than anyone would have thought and preach Alex Plank's dictum that \"most autistics don't want to be cured'.some time ago, I wrote about one of these unsavory characters doing this as did Elyse Bruce of the Midnight in Chicago blog before me.This is aside from the demographic issues that I've written in the past about ND being heavily female skewed (Coreen Becker, who originated the autism speaking day, is just one example) and the other problems of these people claiming they represent all of us.Exactly one year ago today,I wrote a blog post entitled \"shallow brooks are noisy\" to comment on when this event first started. This is still true today. Ms. Becker and other neurodiversity proponents at best have nothing to say that is not superficial that has not been said ad nauseum. At worst they are preaching nothing but hate mongering and propaganda how autism is a gift and Bill Gates and Einstein were autistic, so autistics can do just fine and there are no worries.Well, let me have my say on this auspicious day. I hate having this disability and having accomplished so little at age 56. I hate not being to have good fine motor coordination, not being able to support myself and being given the runaround by various government agencies. I hate my unpopularity with others, the celibacy that goes with this. I hate that Iwas a chronic bedwetter until age 13. I long for a cure, but I realize I am a discontented child crying for toasted snow as the Arab proverb goes.Last year I pointed out to Ms. Becker that indeed still waters run deep and she and her friends are some noisy shallow brooks. She replied to me that the squeaky wheel gets the grease. This may be true. The majority of neurodiversity proponents are probably know nothing college kids who have too much time on their hands and spend it protesting. As MJ pointed out, others more severely afflicted aren't in a position to refute what these people say. But what about their parents? One problem is that parents of autistic children are often busy trying to find treatments. They are busy litigating in court for treatments they feel they are entitled to under IDEA or whatever government benefits they need to make life easier. Though I don't know first hand, I believe that having a child like this is far more time consuming than a typical child, though I know some people might not like hearing the sad truth. So, the parents don't have the time to tell their side of the story either in many cases, one disadvantage they have over the unencumbered neurodiversitites. Ergo, they don't have time to lobby government officials, organize protests against ASAN akin to the protests organized against Autism Speaks, etc.Is Ms. Becker correct with her squeaky wheel analogy? I don't know. I realize that autism speaks has listened to their concerns. One example is the affirmative action in recruiting a high school dropout on their scientific advisory board along with the M.D.'s and Ph.Ds. The young activists may have successfully pushed for other changes. But we still have the combating autism act, we still have scientific research in genetics and neuroscience hoping to find a cure or treatments that will lead to a better life for these people and their parents. Let's hope another proverb rings true: The dogs may bark but the caravan moves on.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/11/autistics-speaking-day-listen-to.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/11/shallow-brooks-are-noisy-redux.html", "title": "\nShallow brooks are noisy redux department\n"},

What about Sean Lapin, Dov Shestack, John Belmonte and many other autistic persons who have limited to nonexistent speech who are incapable of rebutting Ne'eman's nonsense and asking him to butt out and speak for himself and and not for other autistics.Ne'eman also stated in this diatribe at Harvard that autism should be looked upon as a disability and not a disease, yet neglects to explain the difference between a disability and a disease.As has been meticulously documented in numerous posts on autism's gadfly, Ne'eman has repeatedly stated that he does not believe that autism is a disability in spite of claiming he never said anything to that effect. We have to wonder why he is now backpedaling and now stating autism should be looked upon as a disability. Could there be political reasons?Ari Ne'eman and ASAN, I resent you trying to speak for all autistic persons. Almost all of us, myself included, are lower functioning (or more impaired for those who express distaste at the low functioning high functioning dichotomy) than you are. There are others who can't speak and say that they would like autism eradicated. There are others, besides me, who have expressed a desire for a cure. Their numbers seem to be ever growing.Remember, Ari, nothing about us without us.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/10/15/autism-school-autistic-research/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/10/ari-neeman-disenfranchizes-pro-cure-and.html", "title": "\nAri Ne'eman disenfranchises pro-cure and nonverbal autistics yet again\n"},
{"date": " November 14, 2011", "body": "\nLately, the new paper by Eric Courchesne and company has been receiving a fair amount of media attention. It deals with the count of neurons in a small number of postmortem autistic brains. The neuroskeptic has written a pretty decent take of it on his blog. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find the paper online anywhere where it is not behind a paywall. UCLA biomed was not open when I went there yesterday in the morning. I hope to someday read the primary source.In brief, the research group found a far greater number of neurons in the prefrontal cortex area of the brain than in the normal control brains. There were some other abnormalities found in the autistic brains as well, but none in the nonautistic brains. This was a very small sample aged 2-16.This finding may strengthen some of the research findings previously reported. These are the areas that contain some of the mirror neurons. Regular readers of this blog will recall, I'm interested in mirror neurons and have written about them previously. There is a good deal of research that suggests that mirror neurons may somehow be implicated in the etiology of autism. Either a paucity of MN's or problems with connections could be involved. Though this study obviously would not suggest the former, the latter could be a possible scenario as the excess number of brain cells might have difficulty making connections to various other parts of the brain that would ensure good functioning.These neurons are only formed during the prenatal period and no new ones grow in the brain after this. This suggests that the brain abnormalities in autism only develop in the womb and not after birth. This suggests evidence against the Age of Autism folks and others who believe that vaccines or some other exposure in the environment after birth caused the autism. I'm sure they have some sort of alternative explanation though. Of course it doesn't rule out some sort of environmental insult during pregnancy.Nearly my entire life (more than five and a half decades now) I have wondered about the etiology of my problems. One of the first suggestions, as some Gadfly readers will remember was castration anxiety in my youth during the psychoanalytic heyday. One doctor speculated that roseola that I contracted at age one and a half was responsible. But no definitive answers as I don't buy those first two. This study does make some sense in giving some explanations for my disability. One of these areas is Broca's area which is implicated in the motor mechanics of speech. Person's who develop strokes in this area lose their ability to speak. This might be why I stopped speaking at age two and a half. These also comprise the motor areas, so they could account for my handwriting and fine motor coordination problems. However, they don't account for the twiddling (self-stimulatory) behaviors. Of course, even if this were the case with me as an individual, it does not explain why I would have grown all those extra neurons while still in the womb.It was Courchesne who more than twenty years ago, found abnormalities in parts of the cerebellar vermis in autistics on MRI scans. Shortly after that I was his research subject in a few studies he did. I wrote an article about thatI also wrote a blog posts about some of these experiences.When I met Courchesne, I was curious as to why some persons with autism (not including myself) had intact motor systems and if they had cerebellar impairments why they would not have ataxia or other motor problems. He stated the reason was that if damage to the cerebellum occurred early enough (during fetal development) there would be no motor impairments. So, if this is true, this might mean analogies between the excess of prefrontal neurons and the lack of connections might not be analogous to aphasias that occur when people have strokes in Broca's area.So, there is still stuff that is left unanswered and I guess I will never know the etiology of these problems and what areas in my brain don't work correctly.If I can ever get my hands on the actual paper, perhaps I will write a follow-up blog post.Addendum: My sister, who's a faculty member of a university and has a subscription to various journals had access to the complete paper and I read the .pdf file. Though I have read the entire paper now, I have nothing more, unfortunately to add to my commentary at this time.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2011/11/autism-what-big-prefrontal-cortex-you.html", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/corc.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/11/eric-courchesnes-new-paper-answer-to-my.html", "title": "\nEric Courchesne's new paper: an answer to my problem's etiology?\n"},

This means that my nearly four and a half year pursuit of this matter is over. Though it is disappointing, it is somewhat of a relief not to have this issue hanging over my head anymore. I have not had autism's gadfly for even four years, which means this issue goes back to before this blog existed.It is true that I did work with some success with my limitations. However, considering how tough I had it, I felt that I should have qualified for this help. As I have stated in previous posts, this was not a handout. I did put more than $40,000 into social security. I tried like hell for more than 27 years to avoid this fate. Because I had some success in getting a few licks in against this figurative 800 lb gorilla I am being punished (or at least that is part of the reason). The government believes that people like me should fend for ourselves. It would seem that effort is punished and decadence and sloth are rewarded. Even the idea that autism is an advantage in the workplace rather than a liability gets credence from the government who funds rogue scientist Morton Gernsbacher and autism speaks has funded her partner in crime Laurent Mottron in the past.However, I take solace in the fact that even though I'm 56 years old my life is not over and it might not be too late to accomplish something. Maybe even a miracle will happen and I'll be able to make some money again. Previously,I wrote about my bad experiences with the state department of rehabilitation It was quite a long time ago, but I felt pretty hopeless in those days, but I was able to get out and find some work in spite of these mishaps.So this issue finally comes to an end and I can get on with the next chapter of my life whatever that may be.I'll just have to remember that you never know what is around the next corner.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/11/my-disability-case-end-of-line.html", "title": "\nMy disability case: The end of the line\n"},
{"date": " December 10, 2011", "body": "\nPersons who believe in the philosophy known as neurodiversity, that autism is not a disease or devastating disorder or in some cases state it is not even a disability, are full of nastiness and dirty tricks. They insult people they disagree with, calling them Nazis, they insult the mothers of autistic people who desire a cure, and even essentially bring back the Bettelheim era, claiming the person's disability comes from a mother who taught them to hate themselves. They even stoop to making fun of the person's disability in some instances.One of the dirtiest tricks they play is the murder card. From time to time autistic children are murdered by their parents. In one recent instance a woman smothered her 6 month old child, believing the child was autistic and claiming she could not bear the thought of having an autistic child because of the costs to society and the inconvenience to herself. Without fail, whenever that happens, those of us who want a cure and/or state the truth about what a devastating disability autism is or present figures about the monetary costs of this disability are blamed for these murders. We are told these murders would not happen if everyone felt the same way neurodiversitites did and we just accepted autism as a natural variation of genetics and brain wiring.Autism self-advocacy network stalwart Paula C. Durbin-Westby does not fail to disappoint. On a blog ironically titled The thinking person's guide to autism she writes a propaganda laden post at how terrible we are and how it is all our fault that these kids are murdered. She trots out some of the most ludicrous arguments imaginable, including quoting the post Joseph of the Natural variation blog wrote more than four years ago which was a pathetic attempt at debunking the costs of autism to society. He quoted employment statistics that he could not give the source to when I asked him, but assuring me he did not make it up. He also gave Vernon Smith and Bill Gates as examples of autistic persons. I have shown that Vernon Smith has no diagnosis of an ASD, but rather diagnosed himself by taking an AQ test, a nonstandardized instrument that in no way can be used to give a legitimate diagnosis. I have covered the problems with diagnosing Bill Gates in a variety of places, so I won't repeat those arguments here. All I want to say to members of the neurodiversity movement and the autistic self advocacy network is that you're hurting your own cause by using such nasty propaganda tactics. You're only making yourselves look like the nasty people that you are. You accomplish nothing. It is an absolute disgrace that you have to insult people and use murder to bolster your positions because you have no facts to back up your deranged philosophy.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/12/mother-afraid-of-costs-of-autism-kills.html#idc-container"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/12/neurodiversity-plays-murder-card-once.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity Plays the Murder Card once again\n"},
{"date": " December 12, 2011", "body": "\nOne of the most well-known and widely read autism blogs is Kevin Leitch's creation ,Left Brain/Right Brain. For good reason, I've sometimes referred to them as Left Brain/Right Brain/No Brain. The blog's main author, Matt Carey (AKA \"Sullivan\"), appears to have a track record for not doing his homework and getting things wrong. As has been seen in the past, \"Sullivan\" has gotten his facts wrong about special education. When autism's Gadfly exposed Ari Ne'eman for being less than truthful when he claimed that he never said that autism was not a disability Sully made some pathetic attempts at damage control along with factual errors. He also made numerous factual errors about a Newsweek article that featured Ne'eman and the proactive stance against this article that was undertaken by a number of persons who wish to cure autism and don't believe in neurodiverse bull.Well I'm happy to report actually for once he got something right. Ari and the autistic self advocacy network are apparently requesting that person's with autism be reviewers for federal research grants. They apparently only want people who have their warped ideology:As a result, we\u2019re issuing a call for resumes from Autistic adults and other people with disabilities who believe in the civil rights/social model approach to disability and want to ensure that self-advocates are represented in grantmaking. Please include any areas of expertise within your resume. You can note the bolded part which is certainly bigoted and discriminatory. Apparently I don't qualify because I don't agree with ASAN's belief in the social model of disability. They only want people with their own warped ideology and not everyone's perspective.Aside from this Gadfly wonders why it is necessary to have autistic reviewers and what this accomplishes. Steven Jobs was a very intelligent and talented individual who made great technological contributions to society, yet he was never appointed to a board that reviewed research grants to study cancer. I doubt that just because a person gets an infection that there is a call for them to be research reviewers on antibiotics.Yet, in the world of autism this does not appear to be the case. Stephen Shore, a man with extremely mild autism, has been a reviewer of federal grants in the past. Though he has a doctorate in education, he has no formal background in science and has limited knowledge of the scientific issues of autism. Even worse, John Robison, a man whose claims to having autism are dubious, at least to me, has also been a reviewer of federal research grants. Robison, dropped out of school in the tenth grade, yet gets to review grants along with M.D.s and Ph.Ds. He has admitted that he is not a disabled person, so Gadfly wonders why he even qualifies for a diagnosis.In light of this, I was pleasantly surprised to see this comment from \"Sullivan\":I applaud ASAN for actively working to pull autistics into the research grant approvals. But, I am very curious as to how people respond to this sentence:\u201cAs a result, we\u2019re issuing a call for resumes from Autistic adults and other people with disabilities who believe in the civil rights/social model approach to disability and want to ensure that self-advocates are represented in grantmaking. \u201dThis is a place where I think ASAN tripped up. \u201c...who believe in the civil rights/social model approach to disability\u2026\u201d shouldn\u2019t be there.Autistics of various beliefs should be recruited and representedThanks Sullivan for finally getting something right, and for having the tolerance, unlike ASAN, to be willing to go to bat for people who have beliefs that don't necessarily agree with yours. You are curious as to how people will respond, this is my response.However, perfect records are indeed rare, and in a sense it is regrettable that yours for not getting it right is no longer intact.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/12/asan-seeks-autistic-people-as-federal-grant-reviewers/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/12/amazingly-lbrbs-sullivan-actually-gets.html", "title": "\nAmazingly LBRB's Sullivan actually gets something right\n"},

He even has the motto \"autism is good\" on his website.While I won't claim most autistics want to be cured or give an exact number of 99%, there are certainly a good many autistics who are not represented by neurodiversity. It is likely many of these who can't speak or head bang would like a cure.Many persons on the spectrum are too low functioning or would not have the inclination to write a blog post trying to dispute neurodiversity. Many parents who are working hard, fighting for services and other help for their kids just don't have the time to blog and refute what the ND's say.Many if not the majority of ND's are young college students or even younger teenagers who have time on their hands with very little responsibilities. They are not encumbered from being able to rant and rave and spread their evil message. So, though the numbers may not be exact, the analogy between the top 1% and bottom 99% rings true.It is wrong for Alex Plank, Michael John Carley, Dawn Prince and others to speak on our behalf. They have no way of knowing what percent of autistics support neurodiversity and which don't. There is a good chance that a silent majority does believe autism is not a trivial condition and wish for a cure--including the majority of those on the spectrum themselves.I have no job, can't get anything done during the day and have very little social interaction and I'm in the bottom 99%.Though not easy, I'll do what I can to combat neurodiversity. Hopefully someday there will be a cure for autism or a way to prevent a child from becoming autistic. No, I'm not talking about abortion.I hope the time will come when neurodiversity is exposed for the fringe movement that they are and the 99% of us whose impairments make it difficult to fight back will allow our message to be heard by the media.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismisbad.blogspot.com/2012/02/occupy-neurodiversity.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/02/occupy-neurodiversity-younger.html", "title": "\nOccupy neurodiversity: A younger generation autist comes up with a winner!\n"},
{"date": " January 19, 2012", "body": "\nFred Volkmar, director of the child study center at Yale University has made the very strong statement that changes in the new proposed DSM that are due to come out this December will result in the end of the autism epidemic.The definitions of autism will become far more stringent, making getting a legitimate diagnosis more difficult. At least according to Volkmar and the people he's worked with who compiled the data and have presented it to a conference. This data is as yet unpublished. Autism researcher Catherine Lord has disputed Volkmar's contention, claiming his analysis in part is the result of antiquated data.I wonder what are the implications of this. Will people requiring various services or who want to get on disability have a harder time doing so? Will the Age of Autism crowd who insists that some changes in the environment (such as vaccines or more exposures to mercury) have their arguments refuted and be proven wrong if Volkmar's insinuations that the so-called epidemic is an artifact are proven correct? Will the neurodiversity movement have a harder time trivializing this condition, claiming it's not so bad and claiming that perhaps as many of 30% of autistics are savants have a harder time making their argument? Will certain extremely high functioning individuals such as Valerie Paradiz or Deena Gassner who present at conferences and make money from autism have a more difficult time doing so? What of Laurent Mottron and Isabelle Souleries' research? Will they still be able to legitimately claim that all autistics have superior skills in certain areas? There are other questions one could ask, but you can get the drift.Aside from knowing that Michael Carley will be unhappy that he will have to possibly be associated with head bangers and diaper wearers and may no longer be able to fancy himself an incarnation of Bill Gates or Albert Einstein, Gadfly wonders if Volkmar is correct and if this will really change anything.My first impression is that the answer is no. Nothing will convince Mark Blaxill, Ginger Taylor, Kim Stagliano and others that their kids did not become autistic because of vaccines. This is apparent to me. They will claim that Volkmar is wrong. Neurodiversity will continue to insist that Jamie Gilbert is not disordered but is only differently wired, that if society were to accommodate him, he'd be able to communicate using an assistive device, he wouldn't engage in head banging. His mother would not need to make all of these drastic videos and post them on youtube. They will claim she is a bigot for not accepting her son the way he is. Like other mothers who long for a cure, she only rejects her son and teaches him to hate himself. If Jamie is unhappy about his head banging, inability to speak and compulsion to self-mutilate it is entirely his mother's fault ala Bettelheim. These vicious hatemongers will not change their color.I was denied disability, based on the fact that I was able to work somewhat in spite of my limitations, My success was punished while others' sloth was rewarded. The use of assistive devices has apparently given the government an excuse to deny disability benefits to people. Any excuse will be used to deny disability regardless of the reported prevalence of autism.Having met both Deena Gassner and Valerie Paradiz, it is beyond my comprehension how either of these two merit an autism diagnosis. Of course, I may not know everything about their lives. Both of them allege to have been diagnosed by certified clinicians. I must defer to the judgement of the clinicians and realize that individuals who can attain advanced degrees, get married, have children must have impairments that are not obvious to my untrained eye and somehow merit a diagnosis under the current DSM criteria. But what if the DSM changes? Will Gassner and Paradiz lose their respective diagnoses?I believe the answer to that question can be obtained by looking at another extremely high functioning individual, John Elder Robison. Mr. Robison had written a best selling memoir based on being on the autism spectrum. When neurodiversity complained of no autistics having positions of power in autism speaks, AS used affirmative action and recruited Mr. Robison, someone who hadn't even completed the tenth grade in school, to sit in a room with M.D. and Ph.D. scientists and decide what research they should fund. Robison also gets to decide how tax dollars should be spent.This is in spite of the fact that Robison has admitted to not being a disabled person by any means (his words). Though I am not completely familiar with the current DSM criteria, I find it hard to believe you don't have to have some sort of disability to qualify for a diagnosis. Yet, I must defer to Robison's psychologist friend who diagnosed him at age 40. Perhaps there is some explanation as to how a nondisabled person can be legitimately diagnosed with this condition according to current DSM criteria. So somehow I don't see changing the criteria would take Robison's diagnosis away.Is Volkmar correct? Will this end the autism epidemic (alleged or otherwise)? Will this change anything at all. No, I don't think so.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/health/research/new-autism-definition-would-exclude-many-study-suggests.html?_r=1"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/01/will-new-dsm-end-autism-epidemic.html", "title": "\nWill New DSM end the autism epidemic?\n"},

The blog entry stated that one of the areas these cells are located in is in the frontal area of the brain.\u00a0 Recent research has indicated an excessive number of neurons in the dorsofrontal cortex of some postmortem autistic brains.\u00a0 Also, apparently, there is destruction of these cells in frontotemporal dementia.\u00a0 In a recent post, I wrote about parallels between FTD and autism.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNaturally these made me wonder if these cells might somehow be involved in autism.\u00a0 I asked the neurocritic and he replied:\u00a0 jonathan - There have been speculations that VENs might be involved in \nautism, but conflicting studies have found greater, fewer, or the same \nnumber of VENs. Kind of hard to interpret that. Allman et al. said:\n\n\"There\n are many features of autism that suggest that the VENs may be involved \nin this disorder. An initial stereological study of the number of VENs \nin area FI in four autistic subjects plus controls did not confirm this \nconjecture. However, a second stereological study of VENs in dorsal ACC \nin nine autistic subjects plus controls found that the autistic subjects\n fell into two groups, one with significantly higher numbers of VENs \nthan controls, and the other with significantly fewer VENs than \ncontrols. Thus the controls occupied a middle zone with little overlap \nwith the high or low VEN autism groups.\"\n\nWhen in doubt, postulate distinct subgroups.\n\nUntil recently, it was believed that these cells only existed only in humans along with a few other highly evolved primates.\u00a0 Neurocritic's post dealt with a recent finding of these cells in a lower primate, macaque monkeys.\u00a0 It has been subsequently discovered that these cells are also found in elephants and some whales, apparently only in larger mammals including at least some primates.\u00a0 These neurons develop late.\u00a0 They are small in number at the 35th week of gestation.\u00a0 At birth, a person only has 15% of their final total number of VENs.\u00a0 They continue to grow in the brain up until about age four, coincidentally during the time of the first onset of autism or the time during which at least a partial recovery from autism can be made (as was the case of myself around the age of four, when I regained my speech). \n \nThe fact that various findings from studies of these cells in autism is mixed, does not preclude the possibility that a problem with these cells, e.g. too few, too many or problems with formation and migration could be involved in at least some cases though not necessarily all.\u00a0 in an article by the courchesne group , mention is made of two different studies in which 53% and 58% more voneconomo neurons were found in autistic brains versus controls respectively.\n\nJohn Allman of Cal Tech speculated that VEN's found in the frontoinsular cortex and the anterior cingulate relayed outputs to portions of the frontal and temporal cortex where theory of mind and other social decisions are made and propose the possibility that impairments in this area may be responsible for social deficits found in autism.\n\nHe reports an MRI study in which the area containing VENs in the anterior cingulate gyrus is reduced in volume compared to matched controls.\u00a0 tensor diffusion studies also showed white matter abnormalities in some autistic subjects.\u00a0 This also might be consistent with recent work of Courchesne showing excessive growth in the dorsofrontal cortex as well as the recent genetic study using this data.\u00a0 However, Courchesne stated in the above-linked paper that VEN's accounted for too low a percentage of all neurons in the frontal lobe to be totally responsible for all of the brain growth.\n\nSo, in my desire to finally uncover the etiology of my problems and the reason for my immense suffering, Von Economo neurons may be yet another leaf to be unturned.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/05/spindle-neurons-in-macaques.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/21534993/?tool=pubmed", "http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/306/18/2001.full.pdf"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/05/do-i-have-too-many-von-economo-neurons.html", "title": "\nDo I have too many Von Economo neurons\n"},

So out of all babies conceived\n with DS, 50% are actually born.\n\nSo, this figure that ND activists routinely trot out to bolster their crusade against a cure for autism is questionable.\u00a0 I don't know the exact rate of all Down's syndromes babies that are actually aborted.\u00a0 However, it's clear that it's not the 90 percent or more who just get the prenatal testing.\u00a0 This is clearly a misrepresentation on Ne'eman's part and those who think as he does. \n \nThis is aside from the fact that autism is not Down's syndrome and they are two different conditions that prospective parents would likely take different attitudes toward.\u00a0 I doubt there is any way that the ND movement can extrapolate\u00a0 the true rate of abortion of autistics would be from whatever the number is for Down's is given the hypothetical that such a prenatal test for autism existed. \n\nI realize that neurodiversity proponents will state that even a 50% abortion rate is high.\u00a0 This is not to say that I believe that even coin-flip rate of abortion for Down's syndrome is acceptable, only that ND's should use accurate information if they want to engage in propaganda and fear mongering tactics. \u00a0 \n\nBristol Palin corrected the record.\u00a0 Perhaps it's time that Ari Ne'eman, ASAN and other ND proponents do so also.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10521836", "http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/27/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-90-percent-down-syndrome-childr/", "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/bristolpalin/2012/05/so-how-many-babies-with-down-syndrome-are-actually-aborted/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/05/is-neurodiversitys-92-figure-accurate.html", "title": "\nIs neurodiversity's 92% figure accurate?\n"},

She said she has not spoken to law enforcement \nofficials, pending the completion of the internal investigation.\u00a0\n\nOne wonders who would have motive for tampering with autistic postmortem brains.\u00a0 Though, I'm not accusing anyone without proof or stating there are any certainties, I can't help thinking of that deranged cult of hatemongers, the neurodiversity movement.\u00a0 These people are opposed to finding a cure for autism and are opposed to science funding this endeavor.\n \nNormally these brains are distributed between twenty-four freezers.\u00a0 A month before the malfunction, the brains were all moved into one freezer to make distribution easier.\u00a0 There is an alarm system that is supposed to go off if the temperature falls below around minus 81 degrees Celsius.\u00a0 The alarm system failed to go off.\u00a0 Also, there's an external thermostat that gives the temperature and it read minus 79 degrees Celsius.\u00a0 The freezers cannot be opened regularly as that might tamper with the expensive equipment used to house the brains.\u00a0 One day a technician opened the freezer to obtain a sample and the normally cold air didn't whoosh out.\u00a0 They found that in spite of the external thermometer reading, the temperature was actually about 7 degrees Celsius or about the same as a refrigerator.\n\nI wonder what the probability is that right at the time the brains were moved, the alarm system would not happen to work and the thermometer would malfunction.\u00a0 There was\u00a0 a security camera and checkpoints to protect the brain samples.\u00a0 However, this does not rule out an inside job.\n\nInterestingly enough, this collection of brain tissue was owned by Autism Speaks, the organization that is consistently reviled and scorned by angry members of the ND movement.\u00a0 Some years ago, I donated my brain to the autism speaks tissue program.\u00a0 I've written about this elsewhere. This was before AS engaged in a variety of activities that I don't approve of, but more about that below.\n\nThough, as mentioned above, in spite of the fact the neurodiversity movement has expressed contempt for autism speaks, they seem to be odd bedfellows.\u00a0 At times, their executive staff has attended meetings of GRASP, the organization founded by Michael John Carley.\u00a0 Without consulting me, Carley stated in his book that no autistics want to be cured of their autism.\u00a0 They have funded Alex Plank's Autism Talk TV endeavor, though Plank stated that autism speaks' endgame was to develop a plan to find a way to abort autistic fetuses and engage in eugenics.\u00a0 They also awarded a half million dollar grant to neurodiversity rogue scientist, Laurent Mottron. \n\nBenes has stated that the lab is conducting an internal investigation before going to law enforcement authorities.\u00a0 I look forward to reading any new developments if any. \u00a0\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://articles.boston.com/2012-06-11/news/32177708_1_brain-bank-autism-research-freezer"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/06/freezer-failure-could-foul-play-be.html", "title": "\nFreezer Failure:  Could foul play be involved?\n"},

Not a single one of us has ever been appointed.\u00a0 So the score remains five to zero, though the IACC states they want balanced points of views.\u00a0 They seem heavily skewed towards neurodiversity, though the law states the committee was created for the purpose of combating autism.\u00a0 I'm wondering what is the sense of that? \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThough I won't bandy about statistics in the same manner as Britton, I will say there are a good number of persons on the spectrum\u00a0 I know of who wish they could be cured.\u00a0 Myself, Jake Crosby, Oliver Canby, Chris Charette, Sue Rubin, Marty Murphy, Tom Mckean, Roger Kulp, just to name a few.\u00a0 It's likely there are thousands of others who feel the same way, who have to struggle every day with this horrible disability.\u00a0 However, many of these individuals are incapable of speaking or writing blog posts or even telling the IACC how much they hate this disability and wish a cure.\n\nIf I had my way, the combating autism act would be jettisoned and consequently the IACC abolished, but it does bother me the federal government has such a cavalier attitude toward those of us who wish a cure. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nNow we know who at least one of the public member IACC represents.\u00a0 I wonder if there will ever be anyone to represent us. \n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://webcast.nccsite.com/nih/0007/index.htm", "http://www.thesomervillenews.com/archives/16129"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/07/thousands-of-persons-with-aspergers.html", "title": "\n\"Thousands\" of persons with Asperger's who don't want a cure have Noah Britton.

They used three controls who were matched for age, sex and hand dominance to draw a comparison between Grandin's brain and a typical brain.\n\nOne of the findings was an increased brain volume in comparisons to controls.\u00a0 However, this is probably nothing new as Courchesne's group and I think a variety of other researchers has found enlarged brains in those with autism.\n\nGrandin's lateral ventricles, which hold the brain's cerebrospinal fluid, are skewed, the left one being much larger than the right.\n\nHer amygdala, the area of the brain responsible for anger and rage responses and suppressing sexual desire, is enlarged in both hemispheres.\u00a0 (I wonder if this might explain her stated desire for celibacy :))\u00a0 \n\nThe researchers also found a higher volume of white matter on the left side of her brain as well as enhanced white matter connections in various parts of her brain.\n\nAmong the most interesting of the findings (at least to me) were weak and compromised connections in the left frontal gyrus, which includes Broca's area for speech.\u00a0 She was also found to have impaired connections in the right fusiform gyrus which is the area for face recognition.\u00a0 This has relevance as one of the symptoms of autism (which occurred in both Grandin and myself) is a speech delay or language impairment prior to age 36 months.\u00a0 Also, many autistics, myself included, have problems recognizing others' faces.\u00a0 \n\nI remember reading someplace else (I'm not sure if it was Thinking in Pictures or an article she wrote) that many years ago, Grandin had an MRI scan showing abnormalities of certain parts of the cerebellar vermis that I had when I underwent a scan by Eric Courchesne's research group many years ago.\u00a0 These were not mentioned in this study. \u00a0 \n\nThe knowledgeable neuroscience blogger, The Neurocritic, has given his take on the study . He writes about another talented autistic savant, a 63-year-old man with extraordinary musical abilities, perfect pitch,\u00a0 as well as in several languages and art.\u00a0 Similarly to Grandin, he also had an enlarged amygdala on both sides of his brain.\u00a0 Unlike Grandin, he was not terribly successful educationally and professionally and was only able to obtain employment as a dishwasher.\u00a0 So, one has to wonder how the similarities in brain findings of the opposite sex, though like in age (Grandin was also 63 at the time of her scans) relate to someone who had different gifts than Grandin but was not able to utilize his gifts in order to garner gainful employment.\n\nInterestingly, one study showed a positive correlation of increased amygdala size and greater sized social networkings in neurotypical college students. Neurocritic also mentions another study in which researchers suggested there was a correlation between amygdala size and number of Facebook friends college students had.\u00a0 \n\nThe increase in amygdala size among autistics is nothing new, as the Neurocritic cites two studies in the above-linked blog post where researchers found this in other persons with autism (most likely Joe Blow regular auties without Grandin's and the dishwasher's savant skills).\n\nBrain studies have shown enlarged amygdala's in persons with anxiety disorders and even right wing political beliefs.\u00a0 So what to make of Grandin's enlarged area of this brain nucleus?\n\nImpairments in Broca's area have also been found in mirror neuron studies of autism as well as Courchesne's now year-old study showing the increased number of neurons in this area. \n\n\u00a0 \n\nFewer and smaller neurons in regular non-savant autistics in the fusiform gyrus in autistics were found in yet another study.\u00a0\n\nAlso, the fact that three controls may not be enough to tell us anything may be germane.\u00a0\n\nAnything new here elucidating on the autistic brain or Grandin's so-called savant skills?\u00a0 I don't think so.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/conference-news/2012/society-for-neuroscience-2012/researchers-reveal-first-brain-study-of-temple-grandin", "http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/10/savoir-faire-or-savant.html", "http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n2/abs/nn.2724.html", "http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/131/4/987.abstract"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/10/picking-temple-grandins-brain-anything.html", "title": "\nPicking Temple Grandin's Brain: Anything new?\n"},
{"date": " October 14, 2012", "body": "\nAs regular readers of this blog know, I've been unemployed for about five and a half years.\u00a0 I had to leave the workplace because my autistic disability made it so difficult.\u00a0 \n\nTherefore, I was intrigued to read some interesting ideas of John Robison's on how to solve or at least mitigate this problem.\n\nRobinson proposes giving employers tax credits for hiring persons with disabilities.\u00a0 I'm not sure if this is just ASD's or all disabilities.\u00a0 He calls this a work disability credit.\u00a0 It entails giving employers between a 30 to 60% tax credit for hiring a disabled person depending on how extensively the person is disabled.\u00a0 Interestingly, he ties this in with Social Security Disability stating that the person unable to work and on SSDI could be evaluated for this program and be eligible for the work disability credit instead. \n\nI see a number of problems with this.\u00a0 Robison, unlike myself, has never had to apply for disability.\u00a0 I doubt very much he has any understanding of what the process entails.\u00a0 What would be the eligibility criteria for evaluating people for this program?\u00a0 Would it be identical to SSDI evaluations?\u00a0 If the answer is yes, then merely having a legitimate diagnosis of autism or Asperger's wouldn't qualify people for these tax credits.\u00a0 They would have to prove they were incapable of performing any type of \"substantial and gainful\" employment, meaning a job that pays like about $1000 a month or more. \n\nProving one can't perform substantial and gainful employment is no easy task.\u00a0 At the time I applied for disability I had worked with the limitations albeit with great difficulties, so I didn't have a terribly good case and after a four and a half year fight, I was unable to collect.\u00a0 I was also told that if I couldn't be a medical transcriptionist, that I could perform work as a janitor or a washing machine loader in a dry cleaners by the person who testified against me for the government at my administrative law hearing.\u00a0 I know this is not the case, but I have no way of proving it in an administrative hearing or any other type of court of law. \u00a0 \n\nIn the case of other persons, the government does turn down probably close to 70% of people who apply for Disability.\u00a0 If you want to continue the fight, you have to retain a lawyer who, if they successfully get you the Disability money, keeps 25% of what you would have gotten retroactively.\n\nMy lawyer would not take my case to federal district court as he felt I had little chance of winning.\u00a0 Another law firm also declined to take my case and I gave up.\u00a0 Not long after that, I found\u00a0 out my lawyer had another autistic client whose case he lost in district court. \u00a0 One friend on the spectrum applied for it when he had never worked and was denied.\u00a0 Another person with autism I know was able to get it but it took her and her mother seven years of litigation.\u00a0 They had to give their attorney 25% retroactively. So, there is no guarantee the person would be able to get the credit, in fact the odds would be stacked against them.\u00a0 Also, how would the prospective employer feel about sharing the employment credit with an attorney?\u00a0 \n\nSo basically what Robison is proposing is another system in which tax dollars are used for litigation and people have to be frustrated in having to duke it out in the courts with the government whether or not they'd be eligible for this tax credit.\u00a0 Also, since Robison's plan does not involve a flat percentage but rather a sliding scale, a fight could take place for someone rated at 30% who feels the only way they can get a job is to be rated at 60%.\u00a0 So with all the years that SSDI litigation goes on would be exacerbated with Robison's plan.\n\nAlso, would the employer want this tax credit if the autistic person's behavior were too appalling (at least from their point of view) to employ them?\n\nWhat does this do about the problem that most persons on the spectrum would not have the ability to receive the training to do skilled work?\u00a0 How would they be more marketable if\u00a0 the only jobs they could get were menial ones?\n\nRobison claims this would prevent employers from sending the jobs overseas to let's say India where labor costs are substantially cheaper\u00a0 But he presents no cost-benefit analysis to show this might be the case.\n\nAnother issue I have with Robison's plan is he claims that this would help the self-esteem of those on the spectrum (or possibly other disabilities).\u00a0 I don't believe this would be the case.\u00a0 I don't understand what the difference is between someone having to collect disability and work when they have to take a way back door entrance.\u00a0 Also, the stigma and resentment among fellow non-handicaped employees that those on the spectrum would receive because they are being subsidized.\u00a0 I can certainly speak for myself if no one else on the spectrum.\u00a0 This plan, if this were the only way I could be employed, would certainly not raise my self-esteem.\n\nThis is also assuming Robison's proposal could get through congress.\u00a0 This is iffy as the deficit is already incredibly large due to all the wars and other things the federal goverment spends money on.\n\nIn summary, Robison's plan would jam the courts, raise taxes and/or increase the deficit, not address the issues of autistics lack of social and employment skills, and probably do nothing to raise at least a number of autistic person's self-esteem.\u00a0 Is this plan workable or feasible?\u00a0 I don't believe so.\n\nAgain, I want to emphasize there is no simple, quick fix solution to the employment problems of autistics without a cure or some sort of treatment which currently does not exist.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jerobison.blogspot.com/2012/10/a-modest-proposal-for-autistic.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/10/john-robisons-interesting-autism.html", "title": "\nJohn Robison's interesting autism employment proposals\n"},
{"date": " October 29, 2012", "body": "\nThere's an interesting article  that just came out in New York magazine.\u00a0 A well-written article, it makes a number of valid points about the number of people being diagnosed with Asperger's for trivial reasons as well as self-diagnosis.\n\nAbout four months ago or so, I was contacted by the author, Ben Wallace, who was interested in interviewing me.\u00a0 He asked me about my opinion of Simon Baron-Cohen and I explained why I was not exactly enamored of a number of the good professor's ideas.\u00a0 These included his notion that because autism has stayed in the population in spite of the fact that most autistics never have children suggests autism has some sort of genetic evolutionary advantage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also, his offensive (at least to me) essay in which he wrote that high functioning autism should not be regarded as a disability.\n\nIn addition to his one sentence mention of my belief\u00a0 that Baron-Cohen does not understand the rudiments of genetics, he also wrote about the stories of Craig Newmark's and Bram Cohen's self-diagnosis which  I originally wrote about in my blog.\n\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, no context was really given for my observations of professor Baron-Cohen's possible ignorance of genetic principles.\u00a0 So, I will briefly present it here.\u00a0 Genetic mutations can occur spontaneously for a variety of reasons without being inherited.\u00a0 There is at least some research that suggests that a number of mutations associated with autism are de novo, i.e. can occur spontaneously.\u00a0 Thus, these are not inherited so autism could conceivably stay in the population without either autistics producing their own offspring or due to an evolutionary advantage.\n\nI suppose I'm being a bit irrational about my enthusiasm about a one sentence mention in a national magazine, but I guess it may be part of my autism.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://nymag.com/news/features/autism-spectrum-2012-11/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/10/gadfly-mentioned-in-new-york-magazine.html", "title": "\nGadfly mentioned in New York Magazine\n"},

{"date": " February 4, 2013", "body": "\nMy interview with NPR science reporter Jon Hamilton aired today\u00a0 after a six month wait.\u00a0 The list of media exposure and mentions continues to grow for me and that's gratifying.\u00a0 Apparently, for some strange reason, it didn't air on KCRW, the local NPR station in Los Angeles.  At least as of 8:55, so I just gave up and listened to it online.\u00a0 It did air in some other parts of the country and I've already received a few emails about it and comments on my facebook page.\u00a0 I discussed my decision to will my brain to Autism Speaks autism tissue program and my desire for my brain to be used to elucidate on the etiology of autism and perhaps even help find a cure. \n\nOf course, I'm hoping I have at least another twenty-three years of\u00a0 life (to age eighty or older) and I'm not sure how useful the postmortem brain of someone with advanced age would be.\u00a0 As Hamilton said in the piece, researchers are more interested in obtaining postmortem brains of very young children (perhaps aged 3 or less) because the brain continues to develop up until adulthood.\u00a0 Therefore, the key to understanding the neurophysiology of autism spectrum disorders is to find out what happened at the earliest stage of life possible, since\u00a0 the evidence (at least from what I understand) indicates that autism is a prenatal condition and whatever happens, i.e. abnormal migration of neurons, etc., happens in utero, so the best postmortem brains come from the youngest children possible.\u00a0 These samples are in short supply as obviously there is a dearth of brains from deceased 3 year olds with autism.\u00a0 There are young autistic children who die in accidental drownings or get run over in traffic accidents because they are too impaired to understand danger, and I guess young autistic brains are obtained in this fashion, as unfortunate as these events are.\u00a0 (No, I'm not saying I'm happy about small autistic children dying so we can have more postmortem brain tissue).\u00a0 I realize my friend, Jake Crosby (and others who believe that vaccines cause autism) will dispute this.\u00a0 For that reason, even if I were to drop dead the day after tomorrow at the age of fifty-seven, my brain might not be terribly useful in contributing to any sort of scientific understanding.\u00a0 \n\nOne issue that the piece did not mention was my disillusionment with autism speaks and my having second thoughts about my decision to donate my brain to them.\u00a0 It was several years ago that I met a representative from autism speaks' tissue program at an autism conference and filled out the paperwork for donating my brain.\u00a0 Since then Autism Speaks has done a variety of things that I don't like.\u00a0 I've written about these issues elsewhere in case anyone is interested.\n\nI may just go ahead and donate my brain to Autism speaks tissue program in spite of these things.\u00a0 Of course, I'm not sure what I've done with the paperwork as I recently moved and my problems have made me rather disorganized. \n\nI also wonder\u00a0 if there is an amount of time that an autistic brain can be removed from the head and put in formalin or a freezer for it to be useful in research.\u00a0 My sister, Melanie, will most likely outlive me and I guess I'll have to discuss with her the mechanics of getting my brain to the scientists.\u00a0 She lives in Oregon, about a thousand miles away from me so the logistics of getting my brain someplace where it could be useful for scientific research may not be feasible.\u00a0 I guess I may discuss this with Melanie the next time I see her. \n\nIn the meantime, I hope that someday science will advance to the point where we'll have something that will help or even cure autistic people of their disability. \u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/02/04/170835708/shortage-of-brain-tissue-sets-autism-research-back"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2013/02/gadfly-on-npr.html", "title": "\nGadfly on NPR!\n"},

The term, which was coined by \nAustralian autism-activist Judy Singer and American journalist Harvey \nBlume in the late 1990s, suggests that what we've called in the past \n\"disabilities\" ought to be described instead as \"differences\" or \n\"diversities.\" Proponents of neurodiversity encourage us to apply the \nsame attitudes that we have about biodiversity and cultural diversity to\n an understanding of how different brains are wired.\n\nI must commend Dr. Armstrong for his honesty in telling us what neurodiversity really means, rather than the usual strawman arguments I hear that because I don't like neurodiversity that I'm opposed to human rights for disabled or \"differently abled\" persons.\n\n\nI tweeted back to Silberman that I doubted that he or Dr. Armstrong had ever spent a day of their lives as special ed students, as opposed to the eight years of my life which I was in private special ed schools in the pre IDEA days.\u00a0 Though I realize Dr. Armstrong at one time was a special ed teacher (rather than a journalist like Silberman), I still question how much he really knows about the perspective of the special ed students. \n\nI'm still waiting for Dr. Armstrong to give a specific example of a person who was helped by his approach.\u00a0 He failed to do so in his book.\u00a0 I wrote a pretty extensive comment on his book not long after it was published that I linked to above and the interested reader can check that out.\u00a0 I was disappointed that Dr. Armstrong still fails to do so in this article. \n\nAgain, I take umbrage to Armstrong's comparison of peta lillys or people from Holland not living at a high altitude and comparing this with the struggles that those of us with disabilities have to go through every day.\n\nHe unfortunately mentions Ari Ne'eman in his article.\u00a0 Though Ne'eman was not as honest as he was when he denied that he had ever stated that autism was a disability and then tried to cover up his belief when I provided documentation to the contrary on this blog. \n\nI also wonder about Silberman's point of view as he told me when I first wrote to him about his planned book that he did not plan to trivialize the devastation that autism causes to some.\u00a0 This would seem evidence to the contrary. \n\nI guess I'll just have to be patient until Silberman publishes his book, so I can give my take on autism's gadfly, which I'm still anticipating. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nAddendum:\u00a0 Silberman has now blocked me on twitter, just for politely disagreeing with him and judging his and Dr. Armstrong's ability to assess the needs of special education students because they themselves were never special ed students.\u00a0 Someone else on twitter called my account there a \"troll account\".\u00a0 Yet more examples of how much neurodiversity loves to dish it out, but can't even take the most polite criticism.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/02/06/20armstrong.h32.html?tkn=VVTFaUWg1ZLXiWLwETJgHuuZ4R38HE%2BdaUeC&cmp=ENL-EU-VIEWS1"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2013/02/does-neurodiversity-help-teach-special.html", "title": "\nDoes neurodiversity help teach special ed students \n"},
{"date": " February 13, 2013", "body": "\nOff and on over the past three or four years, I've been writing (and rewriting) a novel about an autistic poker player.\u00a0 It has a beginning and a middle or an end, so technically I could say it's finished and ready to be self-published. But I'm not sure. This is my second more or less completed novel.\u00a0 My first novel dealt with the autobiographically inspired adventures of a young autistic boy in a special education school and his mother's attempts to garner him the best help and services based on having to go through the rigmarole of getting the best stuff possible included in his IEP and having to go through the ins and outs of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\u00a0 I've flogged that first novel and given up on having it published or self-published, but more on that later.\n\nNow that I'm contemplating self-publishing the second novel, I've been looking over the Amazon-owned website, create space, which helps in self-publication for supposedly affordable amounts of money.\u00a0 It was hard for me to understand the ins and outs of their webpage.\u00a0 They charge $65.00 just for helping you format and upload the novel to Kindle Direct Publishing.\u00a0 I was rather stunned when I was told you could just log onto Amazon's self-publishing website and do it yourself for free.\u00a0 A friend from the internet writer's workshop I've participated in said he'd help me do it.\u00a0 I also bought a new kindle recently and have purchased a few ebooks to get used to the idea of maybe having an ebook of my own and the concept in general.\u00a0 Until recently hard copy books worked well for me and I saw no need to purchase a kindle.\u00a0 Changing with the times seemed necessary.\u00a0 I've now downloaded the instructions on how to do it on my kindle, so I might be able to do it myself.\u00a0 If not, hopefully my internet pen pal can assist me and I won't have to cough up $65.\n\nCover art is most likely another necessity in the endeavor.\u00a0 I think create space charges about $365 for that.\u00a0 I have a friend (or friendly acquaintance) who's a professional author and illustrator of children's books.\u00a0 I asked her if she could do it for about two hundred bucks.\u00a0 She said she normally charges $10,000 for cover art, but because I was a friend she'd do it for $200.\u00a0 Then, she apparently was going through a rough patch in her life or was busy with over more lucrative projects, she couldn't do it.\u00a0 It looks like I've found someone else who's a talented artist, and with luck, she'll do it for me for $200.\u00a0 So, if I can get those two items taken care of, perhaps I'll have a self-published novel that anyone who cares to spend a few bucks can download onto their kindle.\n\nThen there's the problem with mass marketing and promotion which costs a pretty penny.\u00a0 Create Space seems to provide assistance in this area also, but hardly at a cost which I can afford.\u00a0 Interestingly, I've now been able to get airtime on NPR twice and another NPR show was interested in doing a show on yours truly, but that fell through.\u00a0 More on that later.\u00a0 The first of the two shows dealt with my first novel.\u00a0 There are a lot of published novelists who would love to get on an NPR show and can't, so perhaps I have a good media gimmick to help sell books.\u00a0 But is that really enough or is there more to the story?\n\nTo date, like just about everything else in my life, my writing career (for want of a better word) has not been propitious.\u00a0 I realize I've written about this on other blog posts, but I see nothing wrong with a recap.\u00a0 I first attempted to write a novel at age 14.\u00a0 Writing a novel would seem to be quite an undertaking for even a typical 14 year old.\u00a0 However, I was autistic and at the time had had essentially no mainstream education, having attended special schools my entire life.\u00a0 At 14, I was mainstreamed in eighth grade (one level below my chronologically-aged peers) and I began writing this novel.\u00a0 My lack of concentration, urge to twiddle (self-stimulate) and inability to be organized prevented me from finishing this project.\u00a0 A few other scattered attempts at novel writing in my teens produced the same result.\u00a0 At 19, I started college and was very busy with that and didn't write for many years.\u00a0 However, the pipe dreams of glory never stopped and I often fantasized about being a commercially successful novelist.\u00a0 \n\nIn the 1990s, a few years after I first became Eric Courchesne's research subject I decided a nonfiction piece might be easier to write than a whole book, fiction or nonfiction.\u00a0 In those days, his findings of a smaller cerebellar vermis in some persons with autism was getting some media traction.\u00a0 I wrote a nonfiction article about my being a research subject for him which was rejected by a number of magazines.\u00a0 My most avid fans know that I've self published this article on my stories web page.\u00a0 I never dreamed that nearly two decades later it would result in an interview that would be broadcast on NPR.\n\nIt was not enough, I also wanted to write fiction.\u00a0 At this time, I became friends with a schizophrenic individual who was a prolific writer of short stories.\u00a0 He suggested that instead of a novel, I try my hand at a short story or two as that might be easier than a novel since you don't have to put in the sustained effort that a much longer work would entail.\u00a0 It turned out he was right and I was able to write 16 short stories, most of them inspired by my experiences and angst as an autistic individual.\n\nI submitted them to magazines and the inevitable rejections kept pouring in.\u00a0 However, I got some encouragement.\u00a0 Glimmer Train stories, a very prestigious short story magazine wrote on my rejection slip for one story, 'quite a moving piece, enjoyed it'.\n\nI still yearned to write a novel and finally in about the year 2000 began \"The School of Hard Knocks\" which I wrote about above.\u00a0 I took a private writing class and met another member of the class, Tamar Brott, a freelance journalist who had done stories for the NPR shows This American Life and Studio 360.\u00a0 She took an interest in my work.\u00a0 The statement that piqued her the most was my wanting to use my autism as a gimmick in order to get the novel published and a best seller and find a girlfriend.\u00a0 She pitched the idea to Ira Glass and the rest of the This American Life crew and they loved it and were interested in having a story about me broadcast on their NPR show.\u00a0 I hoped that this would result in publication of my novel.\u00a0 At the 11th hour This American Life decided not to run the story because they felt that Tamar had given too much of a negative perspective on it.\n\nI started submitting the novel to literary agents.\u00a0 The fourth agent\u00a0 whom I queried with said she was interested in reading the first 100 pages and did not want me to submit to anyone else until she had read them.\u00a0 She wrote me a note saying that although she was interested in the character's story and personally interested in my background as an individual with autism that after having read the sample pages she did not believe she could find a publisher for me, but suggested I might consider hiring a professional writer to help polish it.\n\nI took the suggestion and a couple of individuals stated that there was so much wrong with the novel that I would have to write it over from scratch.\u00a0 At this point I had been rejected by eight agents and gave up.\n\nAfter the fiasco with This American Life, Tamar pitched the idea of my novel to the show Studio 360, a smaller NPR show, but a national show dealing with the arts and one who a number of prestigious and published authors have appeared on.\u00a0 I can't help wondering if I'm the only person in history who had one book doctor tell me it was a waste of time to edit my novel and then a month after that read from my novel on a national radio show and was unable to get it published.\u00a0 Even the title was a ghastly cliche and I couldn't think of a better one (I still can't).\u00a0 I submitted it to two more agents and my rejections totaled ten.\u00a0 \n\nDiscouraged, I turned my efforts to nonfiction and wrote a short book about my take on various things concerning autism.\u00a0 It was sort of a rough effort and I did not bother submitting the book anyplace.\u00a0 I did, however, self-publish one of the book's ten chapters on my website, an essay questioning the posthumous autism diagnoses of Albert Einstein, Thomas Jefferson and Bill Gates.\n\nI tried writing another novel but was not able to get very far into it.\u00a0 Then the idea of a novel about an autistic poker player came to me.\u00a0 I tried writing this novel off and on, but it took a few years to finish even a first draft.\u00a0 It clearly needed work and I took some writing courses, had one book doctor look over part of it and became a member of the internet writer's workshop for guidance.\u00a0 I got some good help there, but it probably still isn't ready for prime time.\u00a0 I' m not sure I care.\u00a0 I think it's a good story and I want it to be heard so I may take a chance and self publish it.\u00a0 Will this be a mistake?\u00a0 I don't know.\u00a0 Am I committing literary suicide by writing this blog post?\u00a0 I don't know.\u00a0 Will I only sell a few copies on Amazon and look forward to some one star reviews?\u00a0 Another question mark.\u00a0 Will I be able to get the cover art done and either figure out or get help in self publishing it successfully?\u00a0 Even that is a mystery.\u00a0 \n\nAll I can say are a couple of other cliches Stay tuned.\u00a0 To be continued.......\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2013/02/im-contemplating-self-publishing-my.html", "title":

{"date": " March 25, 2013", "body": "\nFor a long time now, I've complained about the fact that autism speaks advocates that businesses hire autistics, but as far as I've known, has never hired an autistic person as a paid employee to work in their organization.\u00a0 It would appear that this has recently changed.\u00a0 I must say, if Kerry Magro is a paid employee in their organization, I'm gratified.\n\nHis official title is \"Social Marketing Coordinator\".\u00a0 I'm trying to figure out what a social marketing coordinator does.\u00a0 Mr. Magro, in the post, is quite vague about what his job entails.\u00a0 I'm rather curious.\n\nMagro is an individual I'm already somewhat familiar with as he has posted not infrequently on autism speaks' web pages and blogs.\u00a0 He's been described as an \"autism speaks staffer\", though it was unclear to me just what specifically his position was with autism speaks, what he did for them besides write a few blog posts and whether this was a paid position or not.\u00a0 A couple of years ago I wrote a previous blog post where I took Mr. Magro to task for recommending there be affirmative action for autistics in the workplace and autism speaks publishing this on their blog when they had apparently never hired an autistic employee.\n\nThe post states that Magro was involved in some sort of employment think tank that autism speaks was conducting.\u00a0 I have to wonder about the credibility of someone quite young, barely out of college, who as far as I could tell\u00a0 has never worked before, being included in an endeavor like this.\u00a0 Though Kerry has some unique qualifications that others in the think tank probably don't have, i.e. being on the spectrum himself, I have to wonder about a program that includes the input of someone with so little experience in the actual workplace.\u00a0 I have to wonder what this program is like, what the other people's qualifications may have been. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nI'm glad now that AS is starting to practice what they preach and giving an individual with autism (albeit an extremely high functioning one) a chance at a mainstream job.\u00a0 I hope this works out for Kerry Magro and he can perhaps be a credit and an asset to an organization marred with all sorts of problems, which, at least in my opinion so far, has not been very helpful to persons with autism.\n\nHowever, Magro\u00a0is highly functioning and educated, in the process of obtaining a masters degree.\u00a0 What of persons (probably myself included) who don't function at Magro's level?\u00a0 Will autism speaks offer them employment in less executive type jobs (I'm assuming a social marketing coordinator is a more executive job, though I have no idea what this position entails as I've said before) such as data entry or even filing or janitorial work.\u00a0 Perhaps now that AS has become enlightened enough to hire one autistic person, perhaps they could hire some others.\u00a0 Of course, perhaps hiring a less functional autistic as a janitor might be considered bad publicity and this apparent sock puppet of the ND movement might be worried about flack they would get from ND's who might take umbrage at any autistic working a menial job. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nI see that AS has a new employment tool kit coming out soon.\u00a0 I await this with bated breath.\n\nAgain, I wish Magro luck in his new position (whatever it is) and I hope AS will hire other paid employees on the spectrum.\n\nAs a side note to this post, I hope you can read it as the logo for my new novel may be getting in the way.\u00a0 I apologize to any readers of autism's gadfly for any inconvenience this might cause, but I don't know how to make it smaller or position it in a place more suitable and I still want to promote my novel.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/blog/2013/03/25/youre-hired"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2013/03/has-autism-speaks-hired-its-first.html", "title": "\nhas autism speaks hired its first autistic employee?\n"},
{"date": " April 11, 2013", "body": "\nI was interested to read a piece in today's L.A. times about a Stanford University scientist named Karl Deisseroth who has developed a new technique to see better inside human brains.\u00a0 Neurons (brain cells) have a covering over the part called the axon which is a myelin sheath or white matter which helps transport electrical impulses down them so that they can communicate with other neurons.\u00a0 The myelin sheath is made of fatty materials which cause postmortem brains to be opaque so that certain details cannot be seen.\n\nThe Stanford scientists developed\u00a0 a technique where they replaced the fatty myelin tissue with substances that included acrylamide, bisacrylamide and formaldehyde.\u00a0 These don't interfere with light diffraction the way the fatty tissue of myelin does, enabling various parts of a postmortem brain to be viewed that couldn't be otherwise.\n\nThe researchers call this technique CLARITY (Clear Lipid-exchanged Anatomically Rigid Imaging/immunostaining compatible Tissue hYdrogel).\n\nThey initially studied mouse brains.\n\nOne of the first human brains they studied belonged to an autistic individual.\u00a0 They found a neuron that apparently looped back onto itself rather than communicating with adjoining cells.\u00a0 Also neurons in the frontal lobe of this individual\u00a0 revealing \"ladder-like\" patterns in the neurons.\u00a0 They stated this was similar to a finding in Down's syndrome.\u00a0 This is in spite of the fact that in my reading of some stuff by Dr. Manuel Casanova, Down's syndrome brains are much smaller than normal and autistic brains are initially larger, undergoing an abnormal period of growth during a child's initial development and then tapering off.\n\nI don't have the times article online handy, but another articlesummarizes this research well.\n\nDr. Deisseroth seemed to think it was not unquestionable that this finding could be key in understanding the etiology of autism, though I'm skeptical myself. \n\nPrior to this, brains were sliced into small millimeter segments.\u00a0 It was difficult to see how various cells or circuits connected to each other.\u00a0 Also, the tissue could not be used for subsequent experiments. \u00a0 This new technique may help resolve these problems.\u00a0\n\nI'd also be interested in knowing what glial cell abnormalities they might find in autistic individuals since scientists have begun to recognize the importance of glia.\u00a0 Previously, they were just thought to provide supporting functions to neurons.\u00a0\n\nHere's hoping that this technique will help revolutionize our understanding of the etiology of autism so that we know what causes it and make it more likely a cure will be found at some point in time.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/see-through-brains-clear-mental-mysteries-autism-alzheimer-article-1.1313789"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2013/04/will-karl-deisseroth-and-company-bring.html", "title": "\nWill Karl Deisseroth and company bring \"clarity\" to uncovering the etiology of autism? \n"},
{"date": " May 2, 2013", "body": "\nLate last night I finished reading Temple Grandin's new book, The Autistic Brain  To date, I feel it is her most interesting book.\u00a0 Also, it's extremely well written.\u00a0 Of course, Grandin had an assistant author (as she's had for many of her previous books) work with her, so it's hard to tell how much of the writing or even research comes from Grandin herself.\n\nGrandin now concedes she was mistaken about all autistics being visual thinkers which is gratifying. \u00a0 \n\nIt deals with Grandin's pursuit of scientific answers about her own brain by becoming a research subject for various scientists.\u00a0 Most recently, a group in Utah scanned her brain.\u00a0 I already wrote A blog post about this previously.\n\nTo recap, the group didn't really find anything new or revolutionary that could be applied to all autistics in general or even Ms. Grandin in particular.\u00a0 They found an increased brain volume.\u00a0 This is a finding that has been found by other\u00a0 groups in other persons with autism. \n\nThey found her left lateral ventricle was much larger than her right.\u00a0 Grandin speculates that this could be the reason she's had trouble learning algebra and following directions.\u00a0 Scientists have said it's possible that the right ventricle was damaged somehow and the left ventricle grew much larger to compensate.\u00a0 This could explain some of Grandin's superior abilities in visual thinking and design, but more about this later. \n\nStudies of her white fiber tracts using a technique called diffusion tensor imaging found highly connected areas of her brain to the visual cortex.\u00a0 This is something else that could explain some of her talents. \n\nIt showed a larger amygdala which Grandin felt might contribute to her anxiety attacks. \n\nCortical thickness in her left entorhinal cortices was greater than controls.\u00a0 This is a path that goes to the hippocampus, the structure in the brain that creates short term memories.\u00a0 This might be why Grandin has exceptional memory abilities. \n\nShe also stated that her cerebellum was 20% smaller than typical controls in a scan she underwent under the auspices of neuroscientist Eric Courchesne.\u00a0 She speculated that this might be why she's had impaired motor skills and has had trouble learning to ski.\u00a0 I was also a research subject of Courchesne's not long after Grandin.\u00a0 He found that part of my cerebellar vermis-a part of the cerebellum, but not the whole thing- was smaller than in normal controls.\u00a0 However, this finding has not been replicated in autopsies of post mortem brains.\u00a0 Motorically, many autistics are intact.\u00a0 The cerebellum controls both fine and gross motor coordination, and Grandin's ability to draw and perhaps other perceptual motor abilities are not impaired.\u00a0 I asked Courchesne why that might be and he told me that if the problem occurs early enough, a cerebellar impairment won't affect motor performance.\u00a0 Developmental lesions are different than adult lesions. \n\nIn addition to overconnectivity in some parts of an autistic brain, there have been findings of underconnectivity to areas involving longer connections.\u00a0 This may be why some abilities and social skills are impaired in autistic people while other areas, which have shorter connections to the brain, are intact or even greater than in non-autistics.\u00a0 This may explain superior abilities in some autistics. \n\nGrandin also had a visual tract that was 400% larger than a typical control.\u00a0 However, it seems to me that drawing conclusions from one control subject is not really valid. \n\nThere is also the theory that this might help find a biomarker for autism, but I think we're a long way from that. \u00a0 \n\nOne of the problems with these findings, rampant in autism research, is that they are limited to persons on the higher end of the spectrum since more severely autistic persons have problems with compliance and sitting still in a scanner which would cause artifacts in the readings.\n\nScanners are also limited in finding certain things and postmortem autopsies may be a better way to go, though there's a shortage of autistic brains.\u00a0 \n\nIn the past, Grandin has implied that all cases of autism have one underlying genetic etiology, claiming that if autistic genes were eliminated from the gene pool we would have no creativity and every invention from the spear to the cell phone would never have been created.\u00a0 Some years ago, I wrote a piece attempting to refute that notion.\u00a0 She also stated that the reason autism genes have remained in the gene pool is that they serve some sort of evolutionary purpose. \n\nSince her writings on that subject, the science seems to have refuted a lot of her past statements.\u00a0 For example, work done by Jonathan Sebat and others has found numerous cases of autism are precipitated by spontaneous mutations that aren't inherited.\u00a0 She now seems to have changed her tune to accommodate the change in times and concedes that there isn't one autism genes but rather many different genetic conditions, involving various modes of inheritance or spontaneous development of mutations can lead to this condition. \n\nIn spite of this, she still asserts that half of silicone valley are undiagnosed persons on the spectrum but provides no evidence of this. \n\nOne area in which she hasn't changed and is repetition from her previous writings is her pat solutions for helping autistic people become employed.\u00a0 She states that obsessions can be channeled into successful careers and only gives one or two isolated examples and applies this to the entire spectrum. \n\nIt is gratifying that she emphasizes the importance of social skills in gaining and maintaining employment.\u00a0 This is in contrast to neurodiversity advocate Ari Ne'eman, someone who has never worked or been to a job interview or filled out a job application,\u00a0 who has stated that social unpleasantry in the workplace should be overlooked as a criteria for hiring and evaluating people's job performance.\u00a0\n\nOne aspect that I believe Grandin overlooks is the fact that neurotypical social skills can't be easily taught to autistics that that stressors in the workplace might trigger meltdowns and other episodes where socially unpleasant behavior will result in the autistic employee's termination.\u00a0 She states that an autistic's attention to details make him suited for a job as an airport security screener, overlooking the fact that this is a job involving people contact under sometimes adverse circumstances which the autistic might not be socially adroit enough to deal with.\u00a0\n\nThough I believe this book does have some flaws, I do recommend it as a worthwhile read.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links":

{"date": " May 9, 2013", "body": "\nFor the past few years or so, Wired magazine journalist Steve Silberman has been writing a book about autism and neurodiversity. His claim to fame in the field of autism is  a magazine article he published about eleven years ago or so with the somewhat offensive title The Geek Syndrome in which he spoke of the rise of autism in the silicon valley and at the very least implied that math, science and computer genes were the culprit.\u00a0 I've already written about the fact that according to State Regional Center data, the rise of autism in the Silicon Valley has been no greater or less than the rise in diagnoses in other parts of the state.\u00a0 This magazine article was apparently so popular that Silberman has decided to write a much longer book length manuscript with neurodiversity being one of the main themes.\u00a0 I've had dialogues with Mr. Silberman, worried that he might trivialize my horrible disability.\u00a0 He explained to me that was not his intent and convinced me not to judge his book by its figurative cover. \u00a0 \n\nI've awaited publication of Silberman's book with bated breath.\u00a0 For some reason, it's taken him a rather long time to write it in spite of the fact he apparently has a publishing contract and has undoubtedly been paid an advance.\u00a0 Originally, it was supposed to be published in 2013 but apparently it has been postponed until 2014.\u00a0 Judging from the company he keeps with Ari Ne'eman and other sterling individuals from the ND movement, I'm utterly curious as to what he'll write.\n\nRecently Silberman authored a piece in wired magazine nearly a month ago which apparently I regrettably missed.  Had I known about it, I would have written a blog about it sooner.  Of course, there's the old saying better late than never.\n\nIf Silberman's future book is anything like this article my worrying certainly wasn't for naught. \n\nI'd like to dissect certain talking points of the author. \n\nFirst he quotes the person who coined the word 'neurodiversity' Judith Singer: \n\u00a0 By autistic standards, the \u201cnormal\u201d human brain is easily distractible,\n is obsessively social, and suffers from a deficit of attention to \ndetail. \u201cI was interested in the liberatory, activist aspects of it,\u201d \nSinger explained to journalist Andrew Solomon in 2008, \u201cto do for \nneurologically different people what feminism and gay rights had done \nfor their constituencies.\u201d\n\nMy autism distracts me and impairs my concentration far beyond what a nonhandicapped person is capable of.\u00a0 I suspect it's the same in a lot of other people.\u00a0 I wish I could have improved social life and I suspect wanting to have friends and romance is not being obsessively social.\u00a0 Again, there is the offensive comparisons between women's and gay rights, when these people are not disabled and autistic people are.\n\nOne reason that the vast majority of autistic adults are chronically \nunemployed or underemployed, consigned to make-work jobs like assembling\n keychains in sheltered workshops, is because HR departments are \nhesitant to hire workers who look, act, or communicate in \nnon-neurotypical ways\u2014say, by using a keyboard and text-to-speech \nsoftware to express themselves, rather than by chattering around the \nwater cooler.\n\nThe reason the vast majority of autistics are unemployed are underemployed is because they have disabilities that impairs them from learning marketable skills such as plumbing, computer programming, going to law school etc.\u00a0 Also, because they have loud voices and poor social skills which most people find offensive.\u00a0 This is certainly true of people on the spectrum perfectly capable of speaking who have no need for keyboards or text to speech software, which certainly includes most members of the ND movement.\u00a0 I'm curious as to what autistic persons Silberman has even met besides Ari Ne'eman and Alex Plank and John Robison who are certainly outliers. \n\n\u00a0One way to understand neurodiversity is to remember that just because a \nPC is not running Windows doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s broken.\n\nI suppose this statement is true if the computer is a Macintosh or is running Linux.\u00a0 But a PC is certainly broken if there is a blue screen of death, there are not enough memory chips or the hard drive crashes.\u00a0 This is a better analogy, in my opinion, for autism.\u00a0 A Mac or a Linux computer is certainly functional, but a person with autism is impaired. \n\nSilberman then goes on to give examples of persons with divergent thinking who went on to make great inventions or societal contributions.\u00a0 All of these individuals had dyslexia, not autism, which apparently is the subject of Silberman's forthcoming book.\u00a0 I suppose he could have mentioned Temple Grandin, but examples such as these are the exceptions and not the rule. \n\nI was intrigued to find out that Ari Ne'eman and ASAN are working with the department of labor to develop jobs for autistic people.\u00a0 It's odd that as far as I can tell ASAN has not written about this on their web page or anywhere else.\u00a0 As I've repeatedly said, Ne'eman has never worked a day in his life or filled out a job application or had a job interview.\u00a0 I suspect the same is true for the bulk of graduate students and post doctoral fellows who populate ASAN's memberships and executive board.\u00a0 What the hell do Scott Robertson or Steve Kapp or Sarah Prippas know about employment?\u00a0 I will have to learn more about this if it is true and possibly write a blog post about it in the future. \n\nGlad I encountered this article.\u00a0 I am even more piqued to read a copy of Silberman's book, possibly an advanced copy if I'm ever so fortunate.\u00a0 Sounds like this book if it is ever published must be a doozy. \u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers.html", "http://www.wired.com/magazine/2013/04/neurodiversity/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-sample-of-steve-silbermans.html", "title": "\nA sample of Steve Silberman's neurodiversity book? \n"},
{"date": " July 3, 2013", "body": "\nMatt Carey writes blog posts for the well-known blog Left Brain Right Brain.\u00a0He\u00a0appears to have at least some neurodiverse leanings.\u00a0\u00a0It would appear that Mr. Carey  has a penchant\u00a0for making factual errors in blog posts or writing things that don't jive with any established facts.\u00a0 For some reason, he at one time anonymously posted under the pseudonym \"Sullivan\".\u00a0In addition to regularly writing this blog, he's also a public figure in that he's a citizen member of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee, a group that gives policy recommendations to the federal government.\u00a0 \n\nHe's concerned (as am I) with the fact that autistic kids are often bullied and that bullying can lead to a variety of psychologic problems in the victims and even suicide in some cases.\u00a0  He's written a post on the subject.\u00a0  However, he has a rather strange explanation for the reason autistic children are often bullied:\u00a0 \n\nHaving recently seen some pretty horrible anti-acceptance images I feel \ncompelled to make this statement: yes, the portrayal of autism by many parent \nadvocates contributes to bullying. If we don\u2019t accept our own children, with \ntheir differences and disabilities, if we promote a message that our children \nand adults like them are not to be accepted, we contribute many problems, \nbullying being one. Yes, I understand the argument that when some reject \nacceptance \u201cit\u2019s the autism not the person\u201d. I reject that logic. It\u2019s damaging \nthe way we as parents often portray our kids. It contributes to bullying, and \nbullying contributes to many bad outcomes.\n\nAs is par for the course for Carey, he neglects to cite even a specific example of a negative image and how it could lead to bullying.\u00a0 \n\nI grew up as a child who was frequently bullied.\u00a0It was in the\u00a01960's, decades before hardly anyone had heard of autism, let alone publically produced anything that could be construed as a negative image of it.\u00a0 \u00a0Somehow I don't think nondisabled children or even other special education children who might bully someone go around reading the blogs and the internet and whatever it is that Carey construes as \"anti-acceptance images\".\u00a0\u00a0Kids just like to victimize someone who they feel is odd and get some sort of kick out of it.\u00a0 \n\nAs someone who grew up during the Bettelheim era and actually lived through it, I resent Carey implying that somehow bullying is the parents fault, his baseless statement that parents don't accept their own kids, and that bullies just happened to see negative images and that is one of the\u00a0explanations for their behavior.\u00a0 \n\nThere is no doubt that bullying would be done regardless of what images parents or the media portray of autism.\u00a0 It is ridiculous to think that prejudice or animus toward a person with autism is because of parents.\u00a0 \n\nI wonder what Carey's explanation\u00a0is\u00a0for\u00a0bullying of kids who are short, overweight or have acne.\u00a0 Are they not accepted by their parents and/or are negative images made of them?\u00a0 \n\nFinally, I am also curious as to what Carey regards as a negative image since he's so vague about it.\u00a0 Is it that autism is a disease that should be cured?\u00a0 That it's a disadvantage in life that causes incredible pain for the children and their families?\u00a0 Or is it just that a cure for autism would be a good thing, since he seems to have at least somewhat of a neurodiversity perspective?\u00a0 If this is the case, then I wonder why the federal government would appoint this individual to a post that came about under the Combating Autism Act whose purpose is to ultimately eradicate autism and who looks at autism as a negative thing that needs a cure.\u00a0 \n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2013/07/03/bullying-leads-to-suicidal-behavior/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2013/07/matt-careys-bizarre-take-on-cause-of.html", "title": "\nMatt Carey's bizarre take on the cause of bullying of autistics\n"},

{"date": " November 14, 2013", "body": "\nSuzanne Wright\u2019s very recent op-ed piece and John Robison\u2019s resultant resignation from the Autism Speaks advisory boards he served on for more than three years have gained a lot of traction on the blogosphere as well as Robison\u2019s FB page as of late.  \n\n\n\n     Ms. Wright has a very severely autistic grandson for whom she wishes a cure or a treatment which can help mitigate the hardships he and her daughter have to endure.  She wrote a piece on this subject, possibly with the intent of helping to fund raise, which may have had less than tempered rhetoric.  \n\n\n\n     Predictably, the neurodiversity movement (and possibly other persons with autism and/or their relatives as well) took umbrage to her essay.  \n\n\n\n     John Robison, as I mentioned before, tendered his resignation and ended his affiliation with the highest profile of autism funding, research and advocacy organization because of this essay.  \n\n\n\n     The neurodiversity movement, including Robison, has been critical of the advertising techniques that AS has used for years.  They claim that these are intended to evoke pity and show a lack of respect for autistic people.  \n\n\n\n     Practically since autism speaks\u2019 inception, a variety of persons, mostly affiliated with the neurodiversity movement, has questioned why there are no autistics on the board or in executive positions with autism speaks.  This probably contributed to Robison\u2019s subsequent appointment to the organization.  After this, there was little commentary or criticism of autism speaks exclusion of persons on the spectrum in positions of power or policy making in their organization.  \n\n\n\n     All bets are on whether or not Robison\u2019s resignation and subsequent vacancy of an autistic representative of AS does not elicit the same criticism and outrage that it did prior to Robison\u2019s affiliation with AS.  Also bets are on as to whether or not the ND\u2019s will neglect to acknowledge or conveniently forget Kerry Magro\u2019s involvement with the organization they find so odious.  \n\n\n\n     Roger Kulp, one of the frequent commenters on my blog, has expressed a desire to fill the vacancy that Robison created.  It is quite clear from what I have read of his life story, he has been far more impacted by his ASD than Robison has by his.  Though I believe Roger may be a valuable voice, I\u2019m not too keen on non-scientists serving on scientific advisory boards.  Perhaps Roger could be a useful asset to autism speaks without serving in the same capacity as Robison did; I\u2019ll address that issue later in this post.  \n\n\n\n     John Robison has criticized me for what he believes is my unrelenting criticism of him when he\u2019s expressed positions or done actions which I disagree with.  He has stated that instead of being negative and criticize him (or others) I should offer my own positive or constructive solutions.  This has not been easy for me, as I believe there are no quick answers or easy fixes for the problems autism causes.  However, maybe he has a point.  In this post I\u2019ll suggest what I believe may be something constructive that I think would address the issues that Robison and neurodiversity has brought up as well as the issue from Autism Speaks\u2019 point of view of how they can effectively advertise fund raising without perceived dissing of autistic individuals who may not like having someone state that are like lost children or that they are defective or their lives are abysmal, etc.  \n\n\n\n     I suggest that autism speaks recruit volunteers from the higher end of the spectrum such as Roger, myself and others who would discuss the problems autism has caused them in their life.  I could talk about my fine motor problems, ornithophobia, getting fired from jobs, lack of social relationships and the inability to concentrate and get things done during the day and my loud voice and the fact my self-esteem was affected by having been in special education for eight years.  Roger could publicly speak about his experiences of seizure disorders, elopement, etc.  This could help with fund raising without causing offense as we would be speaking for ourselves and not for all the autistic people that Suzanne Wright\u2019s detractors have perceived that she has painted with a broad brush.  This would help to generate much needed revenue into the organization to help find the causes of autism and a cure.  \n\n\n\n     These, of course, would have to be voluntary unpaid spokespersons as it could be construed as a conflict of interest if autism speaks offered any financial incentives for autistics to speak.  \n\n\n\n     Another less obvious point in favor of this plan would be that AS would be living up to it\u2019s name and it would be actually autistics who are speaking.  \n\n\n\n     One problem with this approach might be that if people on the severe end of the spectrum who could not communicate effectively were not included this would diminish the credibility of the spokespersons.  Of course, AS could emphasize that if autism impacts people this mildly afflicted think of what it is like for severe persons.  They could then show footage of more severely afflicted persons without any commentary and let the images speak for themselves.  This would address the problems ND has had with commentary like Allison Singer\u2019s about driving herself and her child off a bridge.  Of course, they could also have spokespeople such as Dov Shestack who would not be speaking with vocalizations but using a communicator to get his point across.  \n\n\n\n     I believe this addresses the problems of autism speaks\u2019 fundraising techniques, their lack of inclusion of actual autistic people in the process, and Robison\u2019s commentary that I don\u2019t offer constructive solutions.  \n\n\n\n     I myself have so many personal issues with autism speaks, such as their funding of Mottron, Alex Plank and the insurance mandates and their autism in the workplace program which just shows autistics working for other employers and not autism speaks themselves that I would probably have to pass on this even if someone from AS happened to read this blog post and thought this was a good idea.  But I know Roger wants to be involved with autism speaks in some capacity whether or not he\u2019s actually interested in doing what I\u2019ve suggested.  There may be others on the spectrum who might be interested in this.  \n\n\n\n     One issue, I\u2019ll concede that this does not address is the ND movement\u2019s desire to hijack the capital of AS and use it for their own purposes, such as ASAN complaining that only 4% of funding of autism speaks goes for service-related issues rather than scientific research.

{"date": " October 5, 2013", "body": "\nAlbert Einstein has been routinely diagnosed as autistic by a variety of individuals, Temple Grandin being the most prominent of these.  Einstein allegedly could not speak at the age of three.  He also dressed in very casual clothes, wore slippers and had unkempt hair and these are largely the basis of these assertions.  \n\nAs I stated in my essay on that topic, there is evidence that Einstein\u2019s speech delay may have been apocryphal.  Denis Brian in his book, Einstein A Life stated Einstein\u2019s sister told a story that when she was born and 2-year-old Einstein was shown his sister he said, \"where are the wheels\" when he believed she was a toy.  \n\nOne of the arguments that is routinely made by individuals in the neurodiversity movement is that because Einstein was autistic and his intelligence is considered an autistic gift is this is one reason autism should not be cured.  Temple Grandin has implied that Einstein\u2019s genius is a result of autism or at least autistic traits.  \n\nTo the best of my knowledge, there is no scientific evidence supporting these assertions. \n\nAs many people know, pathologist Thomas Harvey stole Einstein\u2019s brain after performing an autopsy on the deceased physicist.  He kept many pieces for himself and gave others to a variety of neurologic researchers who found differences in Einstein\u2019s brain as compared to typical age-matched controls.  One of the most interesting discoveries that while Einstein\u2019s brain may have had a normal number of neurons, he had far more glial cells than than a typical brain.  This evidence suggests that it was glial cells rather than neurons that were a factor in contributing to Einstein\u2019s aptitudes and intellect.  At one time glial cells were believed just to hold neurons together and provide maintenance support for them.  Now, there is increasing evidence that glial cells provide more than just support for neurons and may be a more important part of the central nervous system than was originally thought.  However, this is another topic.  \n\nIs there scientific evidence that parts of Einstein\u2019s brain were qualitatively different than postmortem brains of those diagnosed with autism?   a recent study suggests that this may be the case.  The researchers found that Einstein\u2019s corpus callosum had more extensive connections than comparison control brains.  Unfortunately, this study has recently been published and is behind a $35.00 pay wall and I have not been able to read it yet.  There are various ways I might be able to read the study without paying, but I have not exercised these options yet.  \n\nIn comparison, a variety of studies on the corpus callosum of post-mortem autistic brains shows exactly the opposite, i.e. autistic corpus callosums have weak connections between the left and right\u00a0hemispheres and, in some cases, autistics have a smaller corpus callosum or none at all.  There have been apparently some studies showing that individuals missing a corpus callosum demonstrate symptoms of autism.  \n\nIt would appear that Einstein\u2019s brain, at least in this area, may be qualitatively different than in individuals with autism.  Perhaps people can stop trivializing this disability by claiming that Einstein had it or had traits of it.  \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/undiagnosing.html#Albert Einstein", "http://www.fsu.edu/indexTOFStory.html?lead.brain", "http://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/in-brief/2012/cognition-and-behavior-corpus-callosum-smaller-in-autism"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2013/10/does-new-research-disprove.html", "title": "\nDoes new research disprove neurodiversity and Temple Grandin's assertions that Einstein was autistic\n"},

{"date": " February 5, 2014", "body": "\nRegular readers of autism's gadfly will remember last year I wrote a post about an individual who wrote a post threatening to kill people and posted it on the well-known neurodiversity website wrong planet.\u00a0 It was quite an angry rant.\u00a0 Shortly afterward, in a subsequent post, the individual posted that the whole thing was a joke. \u00a0 Maybe it was a joke, but there are certain jokes that are in poor taste.\u00a0 Taking into consideration the recent shootings of Adam Lanza in Newgate, the controversy as to whether or not Lanza was on the autism spectrum, and the fact that in a previous incident, Wrong Planet had neglected to report a similar threat to authorities which resulted in two innocent people being murdered I decided to take action and report this individual to the FBI.\u00a0 I was not sure what the results of this action were, but tonight I've found out about some posts this individual made regarding what happened over a year ago.\n\n\n\nAs can be seen from the screenshot above, this individual is still a member on wrong planet in good standing who logged in today.  I have to wonder why someone who threatens to kill people on a website that has been sued for being responsible for the murder of two people is still allowed on this web site when I was banned for using a handle they did not approve of and posting some anti-neurodiversity ideas. .\n\nOn doing further research, I discovered a thread in which this individual posted where at first he doesn't seem to understand the consequences of his actions but then concedes what he did was stupid but still seems to think anyone who would report him to authorities is overreacting.\u00a0 The thread can be viewed here.  He starts: In the first lines of my rant I stated that is a pure rant..  He does not seem to get it.  He seems confused as to whether a threat is not a threat because it has been classified as a rant in some forum called \"haven\" on wrong planet, where people are free to vent however they please including threats to murder people. He goes on to say:\u00a0 My question here: if a rant in The Haven has these consequences, even making it more than clear that this is a pure rant, how can I trust this community anymore?\n* It was a rant, in the first place. As per my understanding, a rant is NOT required to be a well thought through, but maybe I'm wrong here? Yeah, I'd say you're wrong, but maybe that's just my opinion.  \n\n\nThough the individual in question, apparently resides in Switzerland the FBI apparently tracked him down and reported him to the local authorities.  He states that though they did not take his \"rant\" seriously, the case was referred to the local prosecutor's office which seems odd. Also, apparently this individual really did have a gun: \n\n\u00a0\nFYI: the authorities here didn't even ask me to turn over my gun to them (yet), they only asked me if I would if they'd ask me. Told them I would ofc, if only to be back living in peace myself w/o any more \"official\" hassle. But now, this whole incident, originating from an overworried citizen in the US, is going the official way, next station: public prosecutor's office.\n\nI don't believe I was overworried and I did the right thing reporting this to the FBI.\u00a0 I had no idea whether the first post where he said he would shoot people was a joke or if his followup post saying he really wouldn't shoot people was covering his tracks.\u00a0 Anyone who would post this for trivial matters has some serious mental problems and I wonder what sort of country Switzerland (or any other nation, state or municipality for that matter)is that would allow someone with problems like this to own a gun.\u00a0 It is a shame that the authorities did not demand he surrender his firearm. \n\nAnother Wrongplanet denizen calling themselves Aspergersanswers does not seem to have a very high personal opinion of your humble blogger:\n \n\nGood lord. \n\n\n\nWhat as*hole idiot called that in. \n\n\n\nIts beyond belief what I have just read \n\n\n\nhow can I trust this community anymore? - You cant. Too many spiteful \nidiots who try to bring you down to their non-functioning level.\n\n\n\nI know this because my trust was soon destroyed here by ONE hate filled cretin. I've not trusted the place since.\n \nThe individual in question complains that he won't be able to travel by plane anymore or visit friends in the U.S.A. anymore.\u00a0 He seems to blame me (or anyone else who notified the authorities for that matter) on his trivial misfortune.\u00a0 He also claims he might be subject to a lawsuit.\u00a0 I really feel no remorse about this.\u00a0 Certainly if he lived in this country\u00a0 the TSA would have reason to regard him as a threat and not allow him on an airplane.\n\nAspergersanswers had more words of wisdom on the subject:\n\nThis is a disgrace. \n\n\n\nWP - or its unvetted trolls are screwing people over. \n\n\n\nThis is by far the most ignorant spite filled hate based forum I've ever seen. \n\n\n\nI'm pretty angry about this. Its the opposite of what people need. Even NT people know better than this.\n\nIn all fairness to Cephalod, the individual in question, he does give a more reasoned response in his last post in the thread which largely contradicts his previous posts on the subject:\n\nI would like to add some final thoughts here.\n\n\n\n1. Ultimately, it was me who made some very stupid mistakes in posting \nthat angry rant. Posting an angry rant is one thing, but making such \nthreats I did was just plain right stupid. Even more stupid and naive \nwas not even to think about how others could perceive it. At least I \nposted only a few minutes later my \"all clear, at ease\".\n\n\n\n2. If someone got scared and informed the autorities, that is only an \nunderstandable reaction. Imagine, you'd have lost a family member or a \nneighbor in one of those horrible events that happened again and again \nduring the last years. Who wouldn't be scared then?\n\n\n\n3. Yes, I wish that person would have acted more thoughtful instead of \noverreacting. Didn't happen. It's unfortunate, bur nothing I can do \nabout it.\n\n\n\n4. And the authorities were absolut right to take action. Better ten \ntimes false alert than beeing too careless once. If I were a law \nencorcement officer, I couldn't live with the idea that if only I had \nacted, I could have saved lives.\n\n\n\n5. Yuugiri, you were right about trust. Someone did inform the \nautorities and as I said, I really can't blame that person. So this is \nnot a trust issue in the end.\n\n\n\nAs I said, I made a couple of really stupid mistakes here and I am very \nsorry about it. I will definitly never make such mistakes again. And if \nthere will be consequences for me, I'll have to accept them and pay the \nprice for beeing too stupid and naive in the first place.\n\nI wish I'd known about Cephalod's follow-up posts sooner and had blogged about them last year as soon as they became available.\u00a0 Unfortunately, this is the soonest I knew about it and my apologies to the blogosphere about that. \u00a0 \n\nAs far as I know, Cephalod did not actually go out and kill anyone and does not pose any threat.\u00a0 I suppose some people will argue this happened a year ago and is old news.\u00a0 However, I feel this problem goes far beyond one wingnut who publicly posts on a website that he's going to kill people. and other posters on this website with a bizarre ideology that they actually use some sort of semantic sophistry to claim there's a difference between a \"rant\" and a \"threat\".\u00a0 As far as I know, Autism Speaks still provides funding for autism talk TV.\u00a0 Alex Plank has been a keynote speaker at an Autism Society of America conference.\u00a0 There is a TV show that uses him as a consultant on scripts.\u00a0 Let alone people who purchase advertising on Wrong Planet.\u00a0 Why is it that people would support people like this, who think like this, who run a website like this? \u00a0\n\nMaybe these are dumb questions, but what in the hell is the autism world coming to?\u00a0 Why is it that people throw all common sense out the window? \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n\n\n  \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-e2GyESGgKjw/UvMFlb8KXnI/AAAAAAAAAGM/ZHavbjFZBb8/s1600/cephalopod.png", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/postp5212315.html&highlight=#5212315"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2014/02/wrong-planets-powder-keg-revisited-one.html", "title": "\nWrong Planet's powder keg revisited one year later \n"},
{"date": " March 7, 2014", "body": "\nI've recently finished a first draft of my latest (my third) novel \"Going Through The Doors\"  It's a novel about LSD use, teenage angst, and abreaction (look it up).  Other than that, I don't want to go into too much detail about it yet.  I've got about 133,000 words which comes out to about 439 double spaced pages in word perfect 12 (I've used word perfect 5.1 particularly in the DOS, pre-windows days and I'm not overly fond of Word).  Now, I've sort of come to the hard part.  I have no hard copy of the manuscript and I'd like to start trying to make revisions with that.  It's a bit much for me to print out on my own printer and I've sent an email to Fedex (formerly Kinko's) to get a quote for how much it would cost to type it out.  After this, hopefully I can get started with a rewrite.  I'm sure it's going to need a major one, which I'm probably not capable of turning into a publishable novel.\n\n\u00a0I used them with \"The Mu Rhythm Bluff\", my second novel, and I had to end up paying more for than their quote which sort of pissed me off.  I don't know where else I can go and get this done.  I'm waiting for them to respond to my email.\n\n\u00a0In spite of the lack of the hard copy, I've started to rewrite the 'script a bit.  I might be able to rewrite it without a physical copy, but not sure.  \n\nAfter I've rewritten it to the best of my ability, I guess I could rejoin the internet writer's workshop which I left, not sure I'd ever have another manuscript which they could critique.  I submitted \"The Mu Rhythm Bluff\" in its entirety to this list and got some helpful feedback.  Of course, the number of crits I got was limited as some people felt that long descriptions of poker hands were a bit tedious.  I tried to reciprocate and crit as many people as possible also.\n\nAfter this is done, I will have to ask the question \"now what?\"  Is there any point in submitting it to an agent for publication?  When I was shopping my first novel, \"The school of Hard Knocks\" around, I got a few agents who were interested in reading it, but they took a pass on it as well as the ones who did not want to read it.  Susan Ramer who was Catherine Stocket's (The Help) agent was one of the people interested in reading it and suggested I might want to have a professional editor look at it and polish it up before sending it to more agents.  I went to some editors, most of them were not terribly helpful and they were really expensive and a bit beyond my means.  I finally gave up on that first novel, giving it a good flogging and relegating it to cobweb filled shelves, a space becoming literary cluster fucks.\n\nI'd dreamed of using my autism as a gimmick of sorts to get this autism-related novel published.  I had high hopes when I met journalist Tamar Brott who in the past has done stories for the NPR shows \"This American Life\" and \"Studio 360\".  I hoped getting on \"This American Life\" would result in publication by a major house.  After This American Life was enthused about doing a show created by Tamar about me and my novel, they decided they did not like the way Tamar had written it and killed (or at least put into abeyance) the show.  I ended up on Studio 360 which was a nice consolation prize, but it did not result in publication of the unpublishable work.  The gimmick failed me.\n\n\u00a0After I'd been through rewriting and limited editing of \"The Mu Rhythm Bluff\", I took the plunge and queried with nine agents.  I noticed things had changed in the several year interval between my first and second novel.  Agents no longer even answered prospective authors for the most part if they were not interested in the work.  The publishing industry had totally changed with digital readership and the big chain Borders going out of business and Barnes and Noble having trouble.  Amazon had started to rule the world.  The only up side was that thanks to Amazon and their Create Space and KDP select programs, self-publication was a far more viable option.  I took that route, hoping I could use the gimmick to promote this book.  Tamar had moved to another city and was busy with other things so she could not get me on NPR.  I wrote to Studio 360, asking if they remembered me and were interested in doing another show with me.  They just wrote me a \"don't call us we'll call you\" email.  No media people or reporters were interested in my story, an autistic novelist having written an autism-related novel.  Advertising was not viable or too expensive except for the money I spent on Good Reads.  In short no one was interested in the gimmick which would result in \"The Mu Rhythm Bluff\" being published by a major house getting on the New York Times best seller list\u00a0 and being made into a major motion picture or anything like that.  In the year that it's been out I've only managed to sell 49 ebook copies and three physical book copies-an average of about one book per week.\n\n\u00a0\"Going through the Doors\" is a different story.  The teenaged protagonist does not have autism and there is no mention of autism in the book.  There is no real way I can use the gimmick for this one.  It does not look like the third time will be the charm.  \n\nSo, as I await being able to obtain a hard copy of this draft, I must ask a few questions.  How will I know it is ready for submission or self publication?  Is there any reason at all to even bother querying with an agent?  Is it worth my while to invest the time and capital of self publishing it Amazon, even if it is ever ready for such? In short I must ask the question, Now what?  \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2014/03/finished-first-draft-of-my-third-novel.html", "title": "\nFinished first draft of my third novel \"Going Through The Doors\".

{"date": " May 27, 2014", "body": "\nI was interested in reading yet another article giving easy and simplistic solutions on the problems of unemployment among autistic people entitled How the Hiring Process Marginalizes Candidates on The Autism Spectrum.\u00a0 The article starts out claiming that half a million persons with autism are educated and hirable.\u00a0 I'm not sure where this half a million figure comes from and the article does not explain it. \n\nThe article starts out misrepresenting the 1 in 68 number, as do so many people who write about autism.\u00a0 It claims that many of these autistic go on to higher education and are employable, but are unemployed because societal constraints on the hiring process.\n\nThe article quotes Marcia Scheiner, president and founder of the organization ASTEP (Asperger Syndrome Training and Employment Program) who discusses how important doing well on an interview is to the hiring process and how persons on the spectrum are at a disadvantage because they don't interview well.\u00a0 I've written about ASTEPpreviously if the interested reader is curious about this organization. \n\nI question how many persons on the spectrum (regardless of whether they have asperger's or autism) really have qualifications right out of college which would enable them to do a variety of jobs.\u00a0 Jobs requiring no paid experience are few and far between, particularly in a bad economy.\n\nIf a person has the skill set, I believe they can be hired for a lot of different jobs, despite lack of interviewing skills.\u00a0 I worked sporadically as a medical transcriptionist between 1986 and 2007.\u00a0 To get my foot in the door I had to do piecework as an independent contractor at less than minimum wage.\u00a0 Once I garnered some experience, I was able to get other transcription gigs.\u00a0 No one did extensive interviewing of me for these positions.\u00a0 They were easily able to administer tests to gauge my ability to do the job by giving me a report to transcribe.\u00a0 If you can pass tests like these, you have the job, in spite of a poor ability to interview. \n\nWhen I was trying to get into the computer field, lack of education and experience led me to fail a test in one company I applied for, that did not get me the job. \n\nI know of one individual on the spectrum who has a math degree and has tried to become an insurance actuary but has failed the preliminary exam which can get you hired.\u00a0 What difference does it make whether he can interview or not? \n\nI know of another individual on the spectrum who stammers when he speaks and probably would not be counted as someone who could do well at job interviews, yet he has had a number of jobs, albeit menial ones.\u00a0 Apparently lack of interviewing skills did not stop him. \n\nOne of the main problems I have with this piece, it only addresses autistics who graduate from college (or possibly a vocational school) and not others who will never do that.\u00a0 The majority of person on the spectrum probably have disabilities that would prevent them for acquiring a skill set, regardless of any alleged societal constraints. \u00a0 \n\nWhat about when someone with autism is hired, presuming they have the skill set?\u00a0 Do they have an ability to get along with coworkers?\u00a0 Do they have overly loud voices which would be unpleasant for others and prompt their dismissal from the job?\u00a0 Would they have executive functioning problems which might preclude good hygiene and result in their being fired?\u00a0 Neither the author of this piece nor Marcia Scheiner address this issue. \n\nI believe the best possible way for a person on the spectrum, assuming they can achieve the higher education and the skill set, is to become as skilled as possible in a profession by practice and possibly doing an unpaid internship.\u00a0 This is far more sensible than the ridiculous notion of changing society and getting them to overlook an interview process which probably would not even be relevant in hiring if the person had the skill set. \n\nAgain, there are no simplistic or easy answers to this.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/23/how-the-hiring-process-marginalizes-candidates-on-the-autism-spectrum.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2014/05/more-words-of-wisdom-on-autistic.html", "title": "\nMore Words of Wisdom on Autistic Unemployment \n"},
{"date": " May 19, 2014", "body": "\nI see that one of my favorite autism authors John Elder Robison  is at it again with his latest foray into insights on autism, giving his take on the 1 in 68 number. Robison writes that this means that autistic people are now more numerous than native americans, Jews, and Japanese immigrants and makes a comparison between the struggles of those groups and people with autism.\n\nThis statement might be factually correct if the 1 in 68 number applied to all people living today or let's say people born between 1933, the year when first people diagnosed with autism were born, and 2010,when a child's autistic symptoms might manifest themselves at the age of approximately 36 months \n\nRobison conveniently omits the fact the 1 in 68 figure comes from a prevalence study done by the CDC applying to one birth cohort, people born in the year 2002.\u00a0 The figures from previous birth years are less.\u00a0\u00a0 Also the 1 in 68 figure is an average of a variety of different sites where data was taken from various parts of the country.\u00a0 There are huge differences in prevalence in Utah and New Jersey as compared to Alabama for instance.\u00a0 \n\nIn fairness to JER though, I will concede he is not the only individual who makes this statement.\u00a0 The number is repeatedly misrepresented in the popular media and among autism advocates.\u00a0 He's not the only one who flippantly quotes this figure to play fast and fancy with the facts.\u00a0 However, I feel Robison is in a different class as he is one of the few select representatives on the IACC who advises the federal government on autism policy.\u00a0 He has also been appointed to review grants for the NIMH.\u00a0 I could also give his, at one time, being on the scientific advisory board of Autism Speaks, but fortunately he's already tendered his resignation from that position. \n\nHe goes on to state that Studies (emphasis on plural added) show that the same numbers are present in adult populations of those on the spectrum.\u00a0 As is par for the course from him, he neglects to cite any specific examples.\u00a0 As far as I know, the only study on adults coming close to that is Terry Bruga's study in the UK which suggested a 1 in 100 prevalence number.\u00a0 The study had a questionable methodology and was based on only about 19 people who allegedly had a formerly diagnosed spectrum disorder.\u00a0 Robison uses the plural Studies, not study, so I presume there is at least one other study that he's aware of and I'm not, but fails to mention in the piece.\u00a0 I'm very curious as to what other study, if any, showed a 1 in 100 prevalence in adults if any.\u00a0 Since Bruga's study only applied to the UK and not to the USA, there is still not a single study that I know of showing adult prevalence in this country where the 1 in 68 figure for children born in 2002 comes from so, the comparison of the British and American figures may be apples and oranges.\n\nRobison also goes on to write: \n\n\u00a0We used to think most autistic people were intellectually disabled.\u00a0 That narrow view was based on a limited understanding of what autism really is.\u00a0 As our knowledge grows we recognize more people whose intelligence\n is in the normal range, and some whose IQ is exceptional.\u00a0 The more \nautistics we identify, the closer our community\u2019s distribution of \nintelligence comes to that of the general population.\n\nThis statement is not technically completely false, but leads one to believe that the majority of autistics diagnosed nowadays are of average or higher intelligence as measured by IQ tests. \u00a0 Lets look at the CDC data compiled on six different birth cohorts in the last fourteen years.\u00a0 In the 1 in 68 study that Robison cites, 31% of the children had IQ's below 70.\u00a0 In the six birth cohorts in the CDC's ADDM data, in previous years the percentage of children with IQ lower than 70 were 43, 44.6, 44, 41, 38, and 31%.\u00a0 So severe intellectual disability in autistics was relatively stable up until the 2002 birth cohort when it significantly dropped but not by a really huge amount.\u00a0 \n\nThe first birth cohort for which figures are available for IQs above 85 there is a range of\u00a0 40-62% in the first birth cohort, 33-59% in the second, 38-63% in the third 29-51% in the fourth,\u00a0 38% in the fifth.\u00a0 In the latest birth cohort, there was a significant jump to 46%, but still not a huge increase.\u00a0 These numbers merely represent an average of the large range between the various sites in the ADDM studies and not a uniform number for all sites.\u00a0 This does not include percentages of autistics with IQs in the 70-84 range.\u00a0 I'm not sure what the figures are of people in the 85-99 range which would still be lower than average intelligence since the median IQ of the general population is 100, which means that 50% of all people have an IQ >100.\u00a0 So, though the autistic's intelligence has come somewhat closer to that of the general NT population the increase was not much greater than negligible.\n\nAfter this point, Robison's piece becomes much more interesting.\u00a0 He compares autistic people with minorities.\n\nRobison again uses the \"royal we\" that Harold Doherty has frequently written about:\n\nAs we form a community identity we are beginning to take control of our destiny.\u00a0 Some of us are assertive;\n others are angry.\u00a0 Some are meek but that\u2019s changing.\u00a0 We\u2019re speaking \nout.\u00a0 We\u2019re getting a better handle on the broad range of supports and \nservices we need to live in this society.\u00a0 We\u2019re finally recognizing the\n needs of adults and older autistics.\u00a0 More and more, we\u2019re speaking up \nand expressing our needs in education, medicine, workplace accommodation, and public policy.\n\u00a0Robison neglects to explain what reasonable accommodations autistics could receive in the workplace under ADA that would help.\n\nStarting with the next sentence, the article becomes much better as Robison takes a page out of Ari Ne'eman's book if not outright plagarizing him:\n\n\u00a0we\u2019re realizing that a lot of our presumed disability is a construct of modern society.\n\nApparently Robison is becoming even more extreme in his neurodiverse philosophy.\u00a0 At one time, he apparently believed in doing research to \"remediate the disabling aspects of autism\" though he was opposed to a cure.\u00a0 Now he's claiming to a great degree that autism is not really a disability in itself, but to a large degree only society makes it so.\u00a0 Does this mean that the remedies he's proposing are similar to ASAN's?\n\nThe answer is yes.\u00a0 Robison, in the most interesting part of the article yet, goes on to state that the reason autistics weren't identified previously was that 100 years ago or so, society was completely different.\u00a0 Autistics got along just fine in society and blended in and worked just the same way neurotypical people did.\u00a0 Robison, steals more of Ari Ne'eman's and ASAN's thunder by claiming that if society could only change, our educational system and apprenticing people for work they way they did in less modern times autistics could get along just fine and work and marry just like everyone else and now it is up to society to change and not autistics themselves.\n\nAside from the fact, this argument does not give an explanation of the 4/10,000 number that existed for the 1980s there are other things about this argument that make little sense (but perhaps make dollars for Robison on his speaking engagements and book sales).\n\nRobison's arguments might be logical if he were discussing dyslexics who lived in a hunting and gathering society hundreds of years ago or in the present day in the African congo or aboriginal Australia.\u00a0 They probably would not need to know how to read to survive in such a society, but would have been less successful in a 20th century society where reading is mandatory.\u00a0 However, how logical is this argument for autism?\u00a0 \n\nI don't know if the prevalence of autism in the nineteenth century and earlier was the same as it is now.\u00a0 I do know that society would have been the same socially.\u00a0 That outbursts and behavioral issues would not have been more leniently tolerated.\u00a0 That autistics would still have had the same problems learning to do things as non-handicapped people.\u00a0 I wonder how people who were completely nonverbal could have managed prior to the twentieth century.\u00a0 They would have clearly been impaired. They would not have fit in any better.\u00a0 They would not have been able to be blacksmiths or hunters or gatherers.\n\nSocial unpleasantry would have been just as much a problem in those days as in the present time.\u00a0 Employers would have fired autistic people because they did not like their behavior just the same. \n\nRobison has been quite vague as to how autistic people could be accommodated under ADA (which bars unreasonable accommodations, including putting up with social unpleasantry).\u00a0 The motor problems and meltdowns would have been just as bad if someone were trying to be a whip and buggy manufacturer in the days prior to automobiles.\n\nHe goes on to say the rest of the 98% need us because someone with autism invented calculus, apparently implying that Isaac Newton and anyone else who may have invented calculus was autistic.\u00a0\u00a0 He also states the person who invented pokemon was autistic, but I find that hard to believe also.\u00a0 \n\nSince he's resigned from the science board of autism speaks, Robison's views seem to have shifted radically to someone far more neurodiverse.\u00a0 At one time, he acknowledged that autism was a disability that needed remediating through scientific research.\u00a0 Now he's stated that disability is largely a social construct that can be remedied by societal accommodations.\u00a0 I wonder if he always felt this way and now that being on the board of autism speaks did not work out for him that he no longer has to make politically correct statements to appease a certain subset of persons interested in autism.\u00a0 Of course, I don't know the answer to that. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nOnce again, I thank John Robison for writing such an interesting article.\u00a0 At the end of the piece he states:\u00a0 A new day is dawning for our community\u00a0\n\nYes, it already has, neurodiversity has taken over and has complete credibility and pro-cure people, particularly pro-cure autistics are scoffed and ridiculed. \u00a0 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/my-life-aspergers/201405/autism-the-real-meaning-1-in-68", "http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/empathy", "http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/intelligence", "http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/assertiveness", "http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/education", "http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/career"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2014/05/john-elder-robisons-take-on-1-in-68.html", "title": "\nJohn Elder Robison's take on 1 in 68\n"},
{"date": " May 25, 2014", "body": "\nIn the better late than never department, I've decided to give a point by point rebuttal to a speech given at IMFAR by one of neurodiversity's most prominent proponents, John Elder Robison.\n\nAgain, Robison uses the 1 in 68 figure for autism prevalence so frequently misrepresented by autism advocates and media pundits.\u00a0 He claims to have served on the NIH and CDC committees that discussed the formulation of research at how those numbers were arrived at, yet is woefully ignorant of what those numbers actually mean (assuming he's not outright dishonest).\u00a0 He writes that this means there are more persons with autism than Jews, Japanese Americans and that these numbers show that there are more autistic people than anyone every realized.\u00a0 As I've mentioned in a previous post.\u00a0 The 1 in 68 number was based on just one survey the CDC did in various select parts of the United States.\u00a0 There was a huge range of numbers in various parts of the United States with Alabama being by far the lowest and New Jersey and Utah being much higher.\u00a0 The number only applied to persons born in the year 2002.\u00a0 Anyone who reads the CDC report itself will see the 1 in 68 kids were not formally assessed.\u00a0 If there was something in a school record suggesting the child had autism they were counted in the survey without a diagnosis. \n\nRobison makes the apples and hurricanes comparison between who should advocate for Jewish people or native Americans with who should advocate for autistics, stating autistics themselves.\u00a0 Yet autism is a disease/disability of childhood and though there are autistic adults many autistic people are still children so in the meantime their parents advocate for them.\u00a0 To date, five individuals purported to be on the spectrum have served on the IACC.\u00a0 All of them have opposed curing autism.\u00a0 Not one person on the spectrum who is in favor of a cure or finding treatments to alleviate autism has been appointed, in spite of the fact that Roger Kulp has expressed an interest in the position.\u00a0 At one time, Robison claimed to be in favor of research to \"remediate\" the debilitating aspects of autism (whatever that means).\u00a0 Since he's left the science advisory board of autism speaks, his views have become far more radically neurodiverse (I don't know if this is coincidence or not) and he now states that the disabling aspects of autism are largely a construct of society and if the correct accommodations were made autism would not be a disability.\u00a0 He claims that 1 in 68 persons had autism in the 19th century and before, but somehow they escaped detection as society was so different, yet fails to explain, how someone who could not speak, threw a temper tantrum and was totally impaired from self-stimulation would have been able to hold a job as a blacksmith for example.\u00a0\n\nLet me make an analogy to counter Robison's.\u00a0 As far as I know, we don't have a public citizen member board of the federal government for cancer, diabetes, schizophrenia or any other disease you could name.\u00a0 We certainly don't have someone who did not complete the tenth grade in school serve on any of those boards.\u00a0 Steven Jobs was a highly talented individual who contributed great innovations to society.\u00a0 He was afflicted with pancreatic cancer yet did not serve on any scientific advisory boards to find treatments for cancer.\u00a0 People with infections don't serve on boards to treat antibiotics.\u00a0 If Robison can name me any Ph.D. scientist on the spectrum who is capable of doing research to help autism, then maybe i'll buy at least part of his argument and I would support that person in their endeavors if it would help find a cure.\n\nRobison states that people saying they want a cure for autism is a slap in the face for everyone who celebrates the gifts autism gives us, but fails to mention any.\u00a0 I feel Robison's speech and his anti-cure rhetoric are a slap in the face to me and any other individual who wishes their autism or loved one's autism could be cured including me.\u00a0\n\nHe states that everyone who has autism suffers.\u00a0 Well, John, I have news for you.\u00a0 Every human being, autistic and non-autistic, handicapped and non-handicapped has suffered.\u00a0 It would be an anomolous human being who has not suffered.\u00a0 He cites some of the health problems that autistics have including suicide or depression and claims he's at risk for them every day.\u00a0 For him to imply he has any of the problems a typical person with autism has is ludicrous.\u00a0 It is highly unlikely someone of his functioning level would be at risk for the same types of health problems others on the spectrum are.\u00a0 That is assuming Robison is on the spectrum at all. I'm still trying to understand how someone who has stated they have no disability at all merits a diagnosis.\u00a0\n\nRobison admits that he has never experienced what it is like for a person not to be able to speak.\u00a0 Well, I experienced it, though I don't specifically remember what it is like.\u00a0 I did not recover my speech until close to age five, but I was still nonverbal.\u00a0\n\nRobison defends individuals on the spectrum who claim the word cure equates with getting rid of autistic people and says we should not take that attitude because they would be offended by it.\u00a0 Well, I'm offended by Robison's attitude and their attitude.\u00a0 If someone is so irrational they actually believe that curing a neurologic condition means getting rid of people that is their problem and I hope no scientist will take what Robison says on that matter seriously.\u00a0\n\nIt is indeed unfortunate that IMFAR, an organization that should be devoted to research on how to mitigate and ultimately cure autism would give this individual a platform on which to speak. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2014/05/john-robison-at-imfar-on-autism-rights.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2014/05/point-by-point-rebuttal-to-john.html", "title": "\npoint by point rebuttal to John Robison's IMFAR speech\n"},
{"date": " July 17, 2014", "body": "\nI've previously written about my interest in mirror neurons and their possible involvement in autism.  I've also written about Marco Iacoboni, the UCLA neuroscientist who has done a lot of the pioneering research on mirror neurons in humans.  These are neurons that fire, both in response to performing an action such as a hand movement, but also fire when observing a hand action.  These neurons are also associated with mu rhythms, brain waves found over the prefrontal motor strip.  These rhythms are suppressed in both typical and autistic people when they observe a motion of their own hand.  They are suppressed in typical people when observing the movements of others.  In autistic people mu rhythms still occur in the brain when they observe movements of other people.  I won't go into all of the minutia here.  If anyone is interested, I've written a more detailed post about this here   Dr. Iacoboni has also done work in TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) where a magnet is put up to the brain and stimulates it by creating a voltage so that a group of neurons will have action potentials so that various areas of the brain can be enhanced or suppressed.\u00a0 Though I don't know a whole lot about TMS, it's an area of research that interests me.\u00a0 It was my interest in these subjects that partially inspired my novel, \"The Mu Rhythm Bluff\". \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nAfter I read Dr. Iacoboni's book, Mirroring People, I sent him an email asking him a few questions I had about the book and the field of mirror neuron research.\u00a0 He was very gracious and answered my questions. At various times I've exchanged email with him.\u00a0 Later, we became friends on facebook.\n\nDue to loneliness from my autism, from time to time I take advantage of the chat feature on FB and message people.\u00a0 Not everyone is into chatting in real time when they are on FB, but Dr. Iacoboni would sometimes chat with me. \n\nThere's been a growing interest in using TMS to research the autistic brain or even as a possible treatment for autism.\u00a0 Manuel Casanova has been one of the people to do research in this area.\u00a0 Also Harvard researchers Alvaro Pascual-Leone and Lindsay Oberman have worked with TMS.\u00a0 Peter Enticott in Australia is another scientist in this field.\u00a0\n\nIacoboni and his colleagues are now possibly interested in doing research in this area also.\u00a0 Therefore, he thought it might be good if I could meet him and some of the people in his lab so they could get an exposure to a high-functioning person with autism.\u00a0 So, yesterday, I went to the lab and met the people.\u00a0 They asked me some questions and I gave \"The Mu Rhythm Bluff\" a plug.\u00a0\n\nNext, Dr. I gave me a brief tour of the facility.\u00a0 There has been some research (though I admit I'm not familiar with most of the details) suggesting that under connectivity in the brain may be one of the causes of autism.\u00a0 That is neurons with very long axons that would connect distant parts of the brain with each other may be underdeveloped in autism.\u00a0 Dr. I seemed to believe that with TMS treatments they could improve the connectivity distant areas of the brain have with each other in autistic people. \n\nOne of the problems with TMS may be the magnetic pulses don't reach more than two inches into the brain.\u00a0 Some of the deeper structures of the limbic system, such as the amygdala and the hippocampus, which may be involved in autism lie deeper than this.\u00a0 However, there is a theory that there is a so-called \"cascading effect\" where various areas of the brain are interconnected to each other.\u00a0 This is why Manuel Casanova chose to stimulate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in his subjects.\u00a0 Because it was an area of the brain interconnecting many other parts, aside from the fact that his postmortem autopsies found minicolumnar abnormalities in this area. \n\nOf course, no one knows exactly what is going wrong with the autism brain, so which areas to stimulate or inhibit may not be viable option for research. \u00a0 \n\nI'm not sure if TMS will ever be an effective treatment for autism, but I would very possibly be interested in being a research subject in this endeavor.\u00a0 I don't know if I will be or not, but I'll post future developments in the blog.\u00a0\n\nI enjoyed meeting Dr. I and his staff and hope to see him again some day. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2014/07/my-meeting-with-marco-iacoboni.html", "title": "\nMy meeting with Marco Iacoboni \n"},

{"date": " August 27, 2014", "body": "\nAs many in the autism community know, about seven years ago, Michelle Dawson published a study suggesting that the intelligence of autistics had been underestimated.\u00a0 She compared the scores of autistics on the Wechsler IQ test versus scores on the Raven's progressive matrices.\u00a0 On average, the autistics' scores on the Raven's were considerably higher than their Wechsler.\u00a0 By comparison, a control group of\u00a0 non-autistic people had similar scores on the two tests.\u00a0 The neurodiversity movement made much of this, claiming this proved that autistics' intelligence had been underestimated and it showed that \"autistics were not write-offs\" (Dawson's words) after all.\u00a0 The media reported that intelligence had been underestimated in autistics.\n\nSome years after this, I was interested to find out that two different research studies had seemed to fail to replicate her results.\u00a0 Both of them had been presented at IMFAR (International Meeting for Autism Research) but had not yet been published in peer reviewed journals.\u00a0 I read the brief presentations, but I was still uncertain about everything the studies would say if they were published in a journal.\n\nThe first one had been published by Sven Boelte.\u00a0 I wrote to Dr. Boelte asking him if I could have a copy of the study\u00a0 and he graciously emailed me one.\u00a0 Like Dawson, he found that autistics scored higher on the RPM than on the Wechsler, but the magnitude was not as pronounced as in Dawson's study and it was only found in those with IQ's lower than 85 and not at all in autistic persons with higher measured intelligence.\u00a0 In contrast to Dawson's optimistic statements and those of the pro-neurodiversity media, he gave the more guarded response that it was still too early to tell if intelligence in autistic people had been underestimated and more work needed to be done on the issue.\n\nThe other study was done by Kim Bodner, who I believe at the time was a graduate student working in Nancy Minshew's lab.\u00a0 From reading about the IMFAR presentation, she seemed to be saying that she had found no differences in the scores of the RPM vs. the Wechsler in individuals on the spectrum with normal or near normal intelligence.\u00a0 Though her study had not been formally published, I also wrote to her and cc'd a copy to Nancy Minshew.\u00a0 I never received a response from Bodner, but Dr. Minshew wrote me saying she forwarded a copy to Ms. Bodner and they'd let me know when the study was published.\u00a0 This was over four years ago.\n\nToday, I was surprised to receive an email from Ms. Bodner out of the blue, sending me a copy of the .pdf study.\u00a0 It took awhile, but eventually her study was published.\u00a0 I'd wondered if it would ever be published and I found out today.\u00a0 For anyone inclined to read the entire study, I've uploaded it here \n\nShe had studied four groups--autistic children (up to age 16) vs. age matched controls and adults on the spectrum (17 and up) compared to a control group.\u00a0 She found that in the children with autism the RPM scores were higher than their performance IQs and slightly (but not much) higher than their verbal IQs.\u00a0 The RPM's of the autistics were higher than the age and Wechsler matched controls but not much so.\n\nThe more striking difference was in the adult group where the RPM of the autistics was much lower than their Wechsler\u00a0 scores and the scores of the RPM of the adult control group.\u00a0 These findings don't seem to replicate Michelle Dawson's. \n\nIt must be emphasized that Bodner's study had the limitations in that there were only two girls in the 37 person children with autism group and 5 girls in the 48 person typical group.\u00a0 The adult group (where the RPM was low compared to other measures) had a 25:6 male:female composition of the 31 autistic subjects which is probably representative of the ratio in the general population of those on the spectrum.\u00a0 It would be curious as to how a representative ratio of males to females in the children's group would fare on the RPM.\u00a0 Also, the autistic subjects were all relatively high functioning (meaning they had IQs in the average or near average range).\n\nThe results of various studies support that on average there are higher scores on the RPM than on Wechsler for lower functioning autistic children who have lower than average intelligence and less verbal ability.\u00a0 But for the higher functioning more verbal autistic children, there does not seem to be any advantage on the RPM. \u00a0 \n\nFor adults on the spectrum, the findings of various studies are less consistent. \n\nIf there is any advantage at all on the RPM, it is probably for the lower functioning children who would probably have life problems no matter what intervention or educational strategy is used.\u00a0 I believe this is more evidence that the ND movement is mistaken that certain tests or abilities are not only superior in all persons with autism, but that this proves they have special strengths in jobs or any other endeavor.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/Bodner.pdf"], "link":

{"date": " July 27, 2014", "body": "\nPeople who have followed my blog or my other adventures over the years know that one of my lifelong dreams was to write novels and have them be commercially successful.\n\nI'd hoped to achieve that goal by using something I called the gimmick, which meant that I'd use my disability to get a novel published and help promote it.\n\nOver the years, autism has become a hot topic in the media as anyone who is interested in it well knows.\u00a0 So, why not an autistic novelist who writes novels about autistic subject matter not be something that a lot of people in the general public would lap up and take an interest in? Why can't I be on Oprah (or equivalent as I guess Oprah is doing some other gig now), sixty minutes, the today show, various NPR shows such as Fresh Air and All things Considered, and, as a result, sell novels by the truckload and then have my second (and only self-published) novel, \"The Mu Rhythm Bluff\" made into a major motion picture?\u00a0 In my own particular case, (just talking about myself and not necessarily another aspiring autistic novelist) there are likely a variety of reasons why not, which I'll discuss in this blog post. \n\nIn previous posts, I've written about my trials and tribulations as a writer, but I'll repeat those here in case anyone hasn't read my previous posts or is interested in having their memory refreshed. \n\nWhen I was about thirteen, during my last year of special ed, I decided I wanted to be a writer, particularly a novelist, though I hadn't read a great many novels at the time.\u00a0 I'm not sure what made me want to be a writer or when I exactly decided it.\u00a0 The following year, at age fourteen, I was finally mainstreamed in regular school.\u00a0 I decided to attempt to write my first novel about two boys with mental retardation who befriend each other and overcome the stigma society had placed on them.\u00a0 Writing a novel would seem something extraordinary for even a typical fourteen year old.\u00a0 However, at that time, I was a fourteen year-old boy who had\u00a0 had virtually no mainstream education (the exception being a regular private school I attended for half a semester before being expelled for behavioral issues, a couple of years before I permanently left special ed).\u00a0 I was too handicapped and disorganized at the time to write more than about 50 single spaced pages of this novel.\u00a0 My disability made it hard for me to do much of anything and I spent a lot of time twiddling (self-stimulatory behavior).\u00a0 I made other attempts to write novels during a tumultuous adolescence, including \"Going Through the Doors\" about a neurotic teenager who attempts to solve his problems through LSD use and gets involved in Vietnam demonstrations.\u00a0 \"Going through the doors\" is the most recent novel I've written, but more on that later. \n\nI finally gave up on trying to write a novel as I struggled through college, though the dream never went away as I had a few ideas for stories, but my autism made it so difficult for me to do any executive planning or get tasks done. \n\nMany years later, in my late 30s, I became friends with an individual with schizophrenia who was a prolific and gifted short story writer.\u00a0 I told him I'd wanted to write a novel but couldn't do it.\u00a0 He suggested I write short stories instead as they did not take as much effort or duration.\u00a0 It sounded like a good idea and I ended up writing sixteen of them.\u00a0 I tried to get them published without any success.\u00a0 I got a few encouraging rejection slips which made me think I had some talent as a writer.\u00a0 Glimmer Train stories, one of the more prestigious places you can get a story published wrote, 'quite a moving piece, enjoyed it' on the rejection slip after I submitted my story, \"Mr. Twiddle\" to them. \n\nI still wanted to write a novel though and I began work on \"The School of Hard Knocks\", my first novel.\u00a0 I took a private writing class with a teacher who I later learned was a less than ethical individual.\u00a0 He told me I'd written what was the makings of a good novel and said he believed that one day it would be published.\n\nI also met fellow participant Tamar Brott, a freelance journalist who wrote for Los Angeles Magazine and also did radio shows for NPR.\u00a0 Her work had been broadcast on Studio 360 and This American Life.\u00a0 I told her about the gimmick and what it meant and this intrigued her.\u00a0 She thought it would be a good idea for a radio show on This American Life.\u00a0 She pitched the story to the producers, including the renowned Ira Glass, who loved it.\u00a0 She interviewed me and told me the show would be a done deal.\u00a0 The Teacher of the Literature reading and writing course told me this would guarantee that my novel would be published.\u00a0 I was already beginning to count the chickens of stardom before the eggs had been hatched.\u00a0 This American Life decided not to run my show as they believed the way Tamar had written it was too negative.\u00a0 I would not get to be on national radio and the gimmick would fail to come to fruition. In spite of this,\u00a0 I submitted the novel to several agents.\u00a0 Susan Ramer took an interest in reading the first 100 pages and then rejected it, as did nine other agents.\n\nBy this time, I'd moved on and had taken a couple of novel writing courses at UCLA extension and had some freelance editors look at the school of hard knocks.\u00a0 They all agreed it needed major work and one editor even went to far to say it would be a waste of time to edit it.\u00a0 Tamar was subsequently able to get our show aired on Studio 360, another NPR show that takes on topics in the arts, though they don't have as big an audience as This American Life.\u00a0 This did not result in any publishers or agents approaching me and I realized it would have been a fool's errand to approach them with this particular novel as it stood. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThough devastated, I'd learned an important lesson.\u00a0 In order for the gimmick to work I needed to have the goods, i.e. a novel ready for submission for publication that would hold reader's interests.\u00a0 The School of Hard Knocks had failed on this front.\u00a0 This is the first reason the gimmick probably won't work for me.\u00a0 Though I've evolved a bit as a writer, the writing has to be good enough to rise above the rest of the slush pile and I'm not sure I'm capable of that.\u00a0 A few people though did tell me they loved \"The Mu Rhythm Bluff\" and I'm gratified for at least that. \u00a0 \n\nSome years later, I wrote \"The Mu Rhythm Bluff\" my second novel.\u00a0 Hopefully I'd learned some lessons about writing since \"The School of Hard Knocks\"\u00a0 I submitted it to nine agents and was rejected.\u00a0 Only one or two even bothered to answer me, unlike several years previously when I briefly shopped the school of hard knocks around and every action wrote me back saying they were stepping aside.\u00a0 I'd learned that because of the internet and digital publishing there had been great changes in the industry.\u00a0 As difficult as it had always been for a new writer to break in, it was now all but impossible.\u00a0 The only upside was that with the advent of Amazon's create space and kindle direct publishing plantforms, self-publishing a novel and selling it had become a much more viable option.\u00a0 I decided to go with this one.\n\nI wrote to reviewers, studio 360 whose show I'd been on before, Oliver Sacks and some others and they all rebuffed me or did not answer me.\u00a0 There, were of course, others in the autism field who might have been able to help me out, but I didn't care for Temple Grandin, Simon Baron-Cohen, the people who believe that vaccines cause autism and least of all for the collective membership of the neurodiversity movement.\n\nAnother individual I'd met from the autism world who'd\u00a0 taken an interest in me was Steve Edelson who had taken over running the Autism Research Institute.\u00a0 I disagreed with him on many points, but still maintained a friendly relationship with him.\u00a0 \n\nThough many studies had refuted secretin as an effective autism treatment, Edelson still pushed this (not to mention many other questionable autism treatments) as a legitimate treatment.\u00a0 I wrote some unfavorable blog posts about secretin and Edelson's positions on it.\u00a0 I emailed him telling him about this and he was rather appaled and that ended our friendship.\u00a0 He's not someone who I really could ask to help me publicize my work.\n\nI contacted autism speaks by email and told them about it and never heard back from them.\u00a0 I've been a harsh critic of autism speaks in the past so that may have had something to do with it.\n\nI tried to contact the autism society in Maryland but just got an answer machine and apparently getting a human to return your call from them is difficult.\u00a0 I'd been very critical of them in the past though for having endorsed Ari Ne'eman's appointment to the NCD as well as having Alex Plank as their keynote speaker at one of their conferences one year and maybe that had something to do with it.\n\nI did contact the L.A. chapter and they featured me in a newsletter in the beginning of July and I sold 6 books since July 1 probably because of that article, so it probably helped me somewhat.\n\nSo, in sum, I either have had poor relations or made outright enemies with the group that has the most potential to help me publicize my novels.\u00a0 This and the fact I may be incapable of writing a publishable novel are two of the main reasons why the gimmick probably won't work for me.\n\nAnother reason is that if they wanted to use someone in a gimmick, they might want someone younger and sexier than myself.\u00a0 Now that I'm nearly fifty-nine years old, I really don't fit that bill.\n\nI've now written \"Going Through the Doors\", one of the novels I'd attempted to write in the 1970's during my adolescence.\u00a0 Though I'd failed to be able to write it at the time it would have been contemporary fiction, I'm sort of glad I wrote it later in my life.\u00a0 It seems far more interesting to have written it as a historical novel as a man in my late fifties than it would have been to have written it as a present day novel in my teens.\u00a0 At this point in time, I'm submitting GTtD to the internet writer's workshop where some beta readers are pointing out ways I can edit it and improve it so that it is either ready for submission or self publication.\u00a0 I'm still not sure what I'm going to do with it.\u00a0 I'm not sure if there is any point in submitting it to a publisher, agent or self publishing it on amazon's KDP and create space platforms.\u00a0 One of the reasons why using the gimmick for this probably wouldn't work is because it has no relevance to autism and for a novel by an autistic novelist to get attention it would probably have to have an autism-related theme the way \"The School of Hard Knocks\" and \"The Mu Rhythm Bluff\" did, aside from the fact I've managed to piss off the majority of the autism community, my novels may not be good or publishable and I'm an unsexy 58-year-old.\n\nI'm currently working no a novel length version of my short story, \"Dog Bites Man\" but this has the same problem as \"Going Through the Doors\" in not being autism related.\n\nOther options I have that I haven't explored yet are to have business cards made up of \"The mu Rhythm Bluff\" and maybe going to some autism conferences and handing them out.\u00a0 I'm not sure when I'll do this though, as I still have problems with organization and executive function in spite of the fact I was finally able to write a few novels well into middle age. \u00a0 \n\nI have no regrets though.\u00a0 As superficial a person as I am, I'm not going to be an obsequious yes man just to get some books published and/or sold.\n\nHopefully I'll be able to continue writing for the remaining years I have left on this planet.\u00a0 I'll still write for the joy of writing, but it does not look like the gimmick will work for me.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": " October 6, 2014", "body": "\nThose familiar with my novel, \"The Mu Rhythm Bluff\", know that I wrote a fictional account of a high-functioning individual with autism who undergoes a study involving neurofeedback (training to control certain types of brainwaves) and transcranial magnetic stimulation, a technique in which specific areas of the brain can be stimulated magnetically to induce or suppress the firing of neurons in the targeted area.\u00a0 Recently non-fiction has imitated my art in  a study\u00a0 published by Manuel Casanova's research group.\u00a0\n\nAs I wrote in my novel (and in a blog post)\u00a0 about how Mu rhythms are abnormal in autistic people and how they can be trained via neurofeedback and enabling autistic people to have improved functioning, at least according to one controlled study.\u00a0 Gamma is another type of brain wave that has been found to be aberrant in autistic people in various studies.\u00a0 Casanova's group has done studies showing brain abnormalities (particularly in a structure called the minicolumn) in the area of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the brain.\u00a0 They've attempted to treat this by applying TMS to this area.\u00a0\n\nThis current study is unique in that it is probably the first study of its kind that combines both neurofeedback and TMS to attempt to mitigate autistic symptomatology in a group of experimental subjects.\u00a0 The study used 42 autistic subjects.\u00a0 20 of them were put into an experimental group that used combined neurofeedback therapy to improve gamma wave abnormalities accentuated by transcranial magnetic stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\u00a0 The remaining subjects were placed in a waitlist control group.\u00a0 The subjects all had IQs greater than 80, so people with severe intellectual disability were excluded.\u00a0 Participants with a history of seizure disorder, genetic conditions, etc. were also excluded which I guess is common in a lot of studies like these.\u00a0 One of the interesting thing about the research subject pool is that it consisted of 34 males and 8 females which mirrors the male to female ratio of those on the spectrum in the general population of autistic people. More interestingly, the male to female ratio is probably even greater in a high-functioning group such as this where most of the participants have a normal or at least a near normal intelligence as measured by IQ test.\u00a0 So, if anything, there was a high preponderance of females in the study.\u00a0 This is in contrast with many studies such as this where nearly all or sometimes even all of the subjects are males.\u00a0\n\nThe subjects in the treatment group had regular sessions of both TMS and neurofeedback.\u00a0 On evaluations using portions of the aberrant behavior checklist and Repetitive Behavior Scale, the treatment subjects improved far more than the waitlist controls.\u00a0 Also their gamma function was improved over the controls as well as responses to various event related potential tests.\u00a0\n\nThough interesting, the study seemed to have a few problems and limitations.\u00a0 The group was rated on these measures both by caretakers and a trained psychologist.\u00a0 The authors neglected to mention whether the raters were blinded to the identities of who was in the treatment group and who was in the waitlist group.\u00a0 I emailed Dr. C asking him about this and he told me that the psychologist who did the ratings was blind to the purpose of the experiment, but I'm not sure if that means whether or not he knew there was an experiment and knew who was in the waitlist group and the treatment group.\u00a0 I'm not sure if the caretakers knew whether or not their charge was in the control group or the waitlist group.\u00a0 I neglected to ask Dr. Casanova about this and it is unclear to me.\u00a0 I'm not sure how reliable caretaker and parental ratings are as they are often subjective and biased and seem to want to believe their child is improving when that is not necessarily the case.\u00a0\n\nAnother problem is that assignment to the experimental and control groups were not really randomized as there were factors and treatment choices that influenced whether a subject went into a waitlist group or treatment group. I'm not sure how much if at all this affected the outcome of the study, but Casanova and company admitted to this and stated they hoped to do a more randomized trial at some point. \n\nIdeally, subjects would be placed in treatment and control groups at random with the control group using a sham treatment and the experimental group receiving the real treatment.\u00a0 This is how I had them do it in \"The Mu Rhythm Bluff\".\u00a0 In the real world, however, there are practical limitations in that sham TMS\u00a0 treatment has been easily identified by persons in control groups and has not really been practical.\u00a0 I'm not sure if sham neurofeedback is feasible.\u00a0 Also, there may be ethical considerations in randomizing people in a study where controls would arbitrarily be deprived of a beneficial treatment. \n\nAnother problem that the group acknowledged was that the TMS was more limited than in other treatment protocols such as those with adults being treated for depression with TMS.\u00a0 The group was comprised largely of children (ranging in age from 10 to 21 years old with the average age being about 14-1/2), so they thought that the children might be more vulnerable to an intense treatment. \n\nAnother issue I'm curious about is that not only has Casanova found minicolumn abnormalities in the frontal and temporal areas of the brain, but also in the anterior cingulate area.\u00a0 I'm not sure if TMS of this area was used or not and whether that would factor into the results or if an experiment might need to be modified to account for this.\u00a0 Not only have Casanova et. al. chosen the dorsolateral prefontal cortex to stimulate with TMS because of the minicolumn abnormalities found there, but also because it has rich interconnections to other brain areas that will help with the so-called cascading effect that TMS has so other areas of the brain will be influenced.\u00a0 I write a bit more about this below. \u00a0 \n\nI also wonder if there will be any long term follow-up of these kids into adulthood where we can really assess the benefits of this treatment.\u00a0 We will see if they can complete college, find a good job, get married, etc.\u00a0 (In other words, do a lot of things normal adults do that the majority of persons on the spectrum won't be able to do without treatment).\u00a0 Logistically, it may be hard to follow people into adult years.\u00a0 This may have been the problem in Lovaas (1987) where attempts were made to follow the children into adulthood and funding granted for this purpose and informal presentations made at conferences but no actual studies reported on what happened to the kids as adults and if they maintained the so-called normal functioning. \n\nAnother issue I'm curious about is whether other structures of the brain besides the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will be influenced.\u00a0 Though TMS is very specific for what areas of the brain can be stimulated, the magnet only covers a couple of inches within the cerebral cortex and won't go to deep layers of the brain where areas of the limbic system such as the amygdala and hippocampus are located.\u00a0 Of course, Dr. C has written about a so-called cascading effect of TMS where various parts of the brain are interconnected and can influence each other so that this treatment might influence the structures that are deeper within the brain and not just on the surface of the cerebral cortex.\u00a0 I didn't write to Dr. C about this, but on a side note, I did ask him a question about whether the pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortex thought to be involved in autism were connected to the nucleus accumbens which is an area of the brain involved in pleasurable activities such as drug use.\u00a0 I knew that some of those were connected to the NA and thought that perhaps they were inhibitory cells that contained GABA as a neurotransmitter which had been found to be deficient in the minicolumns that Casanova had found to be abnormal.\u00a0 I thought that perhaps this could explain my twiddling (self-stimulatory behavior) in that there was some hidden motor pleasure center that was inhibited by GABA in typical people whose prefrontal cells were connected to the nucleus accumbens.\u00a0 He told me that the pyramidal cells did in fact have connections to the nucleus accumbens but they were excitatory cells that did not use GABA as a neurotransmitter.\u00a0 So, I guess that's one straw I've been gasping at to find out what is wrong with myself that did not work out. \n\nAnd, of course, another limitation was the use of higher functioning autistics.\u00a0 We have to wonder how persons with IQs below 80 would respond to paradigms such as this one.\u00a0 This is a problem rampant in autism research and not just particular to this study.\u00a0 There are compliance issues with people on the lower end of the spectrum and other problems that would make them unsuitable as research subjects given the current state of the art. \u00a0 \n\nFor years, I've wondered why I have these symptoms.\u00a0 If, in fact, it is due to some sort of dysfunction in the brain, how is my brain different.\u00a0 Why do I have to twiddle, have motor coordination problems, social problems impairing my ability to relate to people and a fear of birds and dogs I am not familiar with? Also, is it possible some sort of neuromodulation of the type that the Casanova group is experimenting with that could help these problems in me and also people like myself.\u00a0 I have to ponder all this, thinking I've come upon some new thing that will enable me to understand myself and help me and everytime I seem to come to a dead end.\u00a0 I don't know if research in neuromodulation such as this will help, but I find it very intriguing and I hope to be able to follow it and understand as much of it as possible, even given the limitations my disability puts upon me. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10484-014-9264-7"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2014/10/cool-new-study-by-manuel-casanovas.html", "title": "\ncool new study by manuel casanova's group with TMS and neurofeedback  \n"},

{"date": " November 7, 2014", "body": "\nRenowned comedian Jerry Seinfeld has apparently recently decided that's he's somewhere on the autism spectrum.\u00a0 The reason is that he does not pay attention to the right things, takes things literally and has trouble with \"social engagement\".\u00a0 I'm not sure what that term means, but I presume it's his ability to relate to people and make friends and find significant others, which is frequently if not almost always impaired in autistic people. (I'll discuss this further later in the post).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Seinfeld has apparently diagnosed himself rather than bothering to consult a clinician.\u00a0 One of the reasons for this may be that he seems to believe his autism is not a dysfunction but an alternative mindset.\u00a0 He joins John Elder Robison in insisting that he's on the autism spectrum in spite of not having a disability of any kind.\u00a0 This makes his belief similar to what members of the neurodiversity movement have been saying about autism for years.\u00a0 Or that it is only a dysfunction because it is not adequately accommodated. \n\nWill ASAN, the Thinking Person's Guide to Autism and other pro-neurodiversity organizations adopt Seinfeld as one of their own, ask him to endorse their cause and help them raise money?\u00a0 The answer is not entirely clear since about five years ago or so, Mr. Seinfeld along with Bruce Springstein hosted a benefit for autism speaks and helped them raise nearly two million dollars.\u00a0 This contrasts with the nearly fifteen thousand dollars that ASAN lost in one of their fundraisers not long ago.\u00a0 Because of this, Seinfeld and Neurodiversity\u00a0 had previously been at loggerheads as I've written in the linked post.\u00a0 In the post I linked to a video that ASAN made in which Seinfeld is harassed by various ASAN members as he enters the concert hall in New York City to give his Autism Speaks benefit performance.\u00a0 Unfortunately, this video has been made private on youtube and can no longer be viewed by the general public.\u00a0 Of course, AS put Robison on their science advisory board, funded Alex Plank and Robison junior's Autism Talk TV and gave half a million dollars to neurodiversity scientist Laurent Mottron.\u00a0 So, I suppose I should not be surprised if Seinfeld decided to do a benefit for ASAN.\u00a0 It is certainly a fund raising idea for Ari Ne'eman to think about as he may not be able to afford to give himself another 62% annual salary increase if ASAN can't think of a way to raise additional revenue.\u00a0 Perhaps Mr. Ne'eman will consider getting Jerry to switch over from autism speaks and give a benefit for ASAN.\n\nNeurodiversity has never cared about people diagnosing themselves.\u00a0 Economist Vernon Smith diagnosed himself using a self-administered quiz, yet that has not stopped them from promoting him as an example as to why autism should not be cured.\u00a0 As well as using him to claim autism has some sort of benefits to society. \u00a0 \n\nSince Seinfeld and I are almost the same age, I wonder how he'd have felt if he had to attend special education schools (and sometimes being abused there) in the sixties.\u00a0 If he'd had to spend more than ten years in psychoanalysis because Bettelheim's theories were in vogue at the time.\u00a0 How he would have felt if he had a phobia of birds, had been a chronic bedwetter until age 13 and could not get things done during the day because he was compelled to engage in twiddling (or some other self stimulatory behavior)\u00a0 I wonder if he had the same rejection from peers as I did as a child or how he'd feel if he had. \n\nSeinfeld claims that he has trouble with social engagement.\u00a0 I wonder why this did not impair his ability to meet and date women and eventually marry one.\u00a0 One way that we are different is in popularity with women.\u00a0 I'm nearly Seinfeld's age, and though I have some casual dating with women, i've never had a full-fledged girlfriend.\u00a0 Seinfeld in his late thirties dated Soshana Lowenstein who at the time was only seventeen when she first started going out with the celebrated comedian.\u00a0 Next came girlfriend Carol Leifer.\u00a0 Seinfield finally settled down and married Jessica Sklar at the ripe age of forty-five.\u00a0\n\nAs for a contrast in our abilities to support ourselves, I no longer work and am supported by family in contrast to Seinfeld who has made millions.\u00a0 I wonder how Seinfeld would feel if he had to spend more than four years unsuccessfully trying to get disability and know that he'd end up being homeless if he didn't have a supportive family.\u00a0 \n\nInterestingly, Seinfeld is admired by an individual on the autistic spectrum who has also been quite unsuccessful with women and has gone out of his way to advertise for a girlfriend, sometimes in a crude manner.\u00a0 Christian Weston Chandler has made a you tube video in tribute to the comedian he admires.\u00a0 Chris Chan has often been a foil for various members of the ND movement.\u00a0 I've written about Chris previously.\u00a0 I never really understood why the neurodiversity movement always preached for acceptance of autistic individuals yet a good number of them always wanted to criticize this individual or even ridicule and make fun of him.\u00a0 The fact that he's such a huge fan of Seinfeld's might discourage ASAN from approaching the comedian to do a fundraiser for them, but I don't know.\u00a0 \n\nCompared to most on the spectrum though, I've had it quite good and have worked in the past and am pretty high-functioning though it has impaired my life to a significant degree.\u00a0 There are others with intellectual disabilities, who can't talk, engage in self-injurious behavior and smear feces on walls.\u00a0 I don't think it is helpful for celebrities such as this man to trivialize this condition which affects so many people. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n", "outgoing_links":

{"date": " December 2, 2014", "body": "\nThere's a story in the news that's been gaining some traction as of late that has piqued my interest.\u00a0 It is about an individual named Anthony Elonis, a former amusement park worker, who wrote lyrics in the form of rap poetry threatening to kill his estranged wife as well as an FBI agent who questioned him on Facebook.\u00a0 There are federal laws against making such threats and Elonis was prosecuted and convicted.\u00a0 He is now going before the Supreme Court stating that these laws against posting idle threats that he did not intend to carry out violate his first amendment right to free speech and are therefore unconstitutional.\u00a0 Elonis claimed that these weren't actually threats but were in fact rants he was making in order to blow off steam and that a reasonable person would not believe these were actual threats.\u00a0 His attorney, John Elwood gave these as arguments.\u00a0 From what I've read, SCOTUS won't render a decision on this matter probably until next summer, but based on their responses to Elwood, they don't appear to be ruling in Elonis' favor.\u00a0 Hopefully they will render a verdict that threats such as these don't constitute free speech protected under the first amendment. \u00a0 \n\nDoes this sound familiar to the few regular readers of Autism's Gadfly?\u00a0 It should because one poster on wrongplanet.net did something very similar. Like Elonis, this person gave a similar rationale for his actions, stating it was only a rant to blow off steam and not an actual threat.\u00a0 Apparently this person was not an American, but lived in Switzerland where the laws may be different.\u00a0 He was apparently questioned by authorities and may have been subject to prosecution from what I gathered from reading what he said.\u00a0 If he were in the U.S.A. he probably could have been prosecuted under the same laws that Elonis was. \n\nIn another instance, an individual named William Freund\u00a0 posted on Wrongplanet that he was going to hurt some people.\u00a0 These were not idle threats, but Freund actually carried them out and murdered two people.\u00a0 Alex Plank and whatever other persons were responsible for running things at Wrong Planet neglected to report this individual to the authorities.\u00a0 If they had, lives may have been saved.\u00a0 I was the one who reported the second individual to the FBI and that is probably the only reason the Swiss authorities were investigating him.\u00a0 This individual has not been banned from Wrong planet but is still a member in good standing. \n\nI doubt very much that Facebook or any other website that Elonis posted such things would allow him to do so.\u00a0 Yet Wrongplanet is fine in being complicit with illegal activities and not reporting actions such as these to law enforcement authorities and allowing them to continue to do so and allowing people who violate federal laws to be members in good standing. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nI believe that not only is it possible there will be a third such incident (assuming there have not been others that I don't know about) but I suspect based on the type of people who post on Wrongplanet it is highly probable that there will be.\u00a0 I'm not sure what the law is, but I wonder if Plank or anyone else involved in the day-to-day administration of Wrongplanet can be prosecuted for complicity in these things.\u00a0 I know that Plank and Wrongplanet were sued by the family of the persons Freund murdered, but I don't know what the outcome of the suit was, whether Plank settled with the family or whether or not a judgment was rendered and I'm not sure what Plank's and WP's liability is in such a circumstance.\n\nHowever, I believe something should be done about this.\u00a0 I'm not sure I have the time and inclination to monitor WP for such posts, but I believe this website and it's administrators should be watched.\u00a0 I hope the Supreme Court won't allow this to be constitutionally protected free speech.\u00a0 I am in favor of the first amendment and free speech, but I believe a line should be drawn somewhere and threats such as these should not be called \"rants\" or be constitutionally protected.\n\nI can only hope that law enforcement authorities will be watching Plank and his buddies on WP.\u00a0 If there is no law where these people can be prosecuted for this stuff, I hope that congress will enact one and if it happens again Plank and other staff members of Wrongplanet will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of that law.\n\nHowever, this does not seem to be the case.\u00a0 Plank was a keynote speaker at ASA, Autism Speaks funded his and John Robison junior's inane videos, he was also a consultant on the defunct TV show The Bridge.\u00a0 Plank continues to bask in glory despite his misdemeanors.\u00a0 I'm not sure I understand this, but I hope if\u00a0 the SCOTUS does not render a favorable verdict in this case, that it won't bode well for Wrongplanet and individuals who write posts such as these and something will be done. \u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.npr.org/2014/12/01/366534452/is-a-threat-posted-on-facebook-really-a-threat", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/freund-176737-smith-home.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2014/12/what-does-current-supreme-court-free.html", "title": "\nWhat does current supreme court free speech case bode for Wrongplanet.net and its members\n"},
{"date": " October 29, 2014", "body": "\nWith Halloween right around the corner, we see that neurodiversity and the autistic self advocacy network is still up to its dirty tricks without giving autistic people and their families any treats.\nThey've apparently lobbied five congress persons to write a letter on their behalf dishonestly claiming that autistic self advocates (a euphemism for neurodiversity proponents who oppose a cure for autism) are severely underrepresented in autism policy making recommendations in the federal government.\u00a0 ASAN recently published  the linked post on their website in which they applaud the letter these five congresspersons wrote on their behalf.\u00a0\n\nThe letter signed by these members of congress at ASAN's and neurodiversity's behest contains one absolutely false talking point:\n\nThe Inter-Agency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) housed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is the body tasked with developing the HHS Strategic Plan for Autism Research.\u00a0 The IACC currently has only two individuals on the autism spectrum and no member from a self advocacy organization out of fourteen public and twenty-eight total members.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe talking point that I've emphasized in the black highlight is blatantly false.\u00a0 The IACC currently has not two , but three individuals alleging to be on the autism spectrum:\u00a0 Scott Robertson (who helped start ASAN with Ne'eman, more about this later), John Elder Robison, and Noah Britton.\u00a0 The no member from a self-advocacy organization statement is also false since Scott Robertson is a member of ASAN and one of the top people in the organization, aside from Ari Ne'eman, ASAN's president.\u00a0 There have also been two other persons on the spectrum who have been on the IACC in the past, Ari Ne'eman and Stephen Shore, who have both opposed curing autism. \n\nWhat is not a lie is that to date zero pro-cure, pro-treatment persons on the spectrum have been appointed to the public membership of the IACC.\u00a0 Of course, the old standard argument is that there are very few if any autistics who look upon autism as a disorder that needs treatment or possible cure or that none are able and willing to serve.\u00a0 This is also not true, as Roger Kulp, an individual with\u00a0 cerebral folate deficiency on the autism spectrum who is anti-neurodiversity and pro-treatment (I'll let Roger speak for himself as to whether or not he is pro or anti cure) has expressed an interest in being a public member of the IACC (as well as filling the vacancy for an autistic in an advisory position at Autism Speaks after John Robison tendered his resignation) yet has been completely shunned by Thomas Insel, the secretary of health and human services, autism speaks\u00a0 and other powers that be.\u00a0\n\nASAN is only interested in having pro-neurodiversity and anti-cure and anti-treatment autistics serve in positions of power.\u00a0 So when they say all persons with autism this is also blatantly false. \n\nAnyone who lives in the districts of the following five congress persons, I urge you to vote for their opponent in the upcoming election: \n\n1. Jan Schakowsky.\u00a0 2. Kathy Castor\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Tammy Duckworth \u00a0 4.\u00a0 Jackie Speier\u00a0 5. Paul Tonko.\n\nI can only wish these despicable members of the house of representatives could be voted out of office next week, but I realize that's an opium-induced dream, but here are their names for edification. \u00a0 \n\nI doubt the congress people came up with these false statements out of thin air.\u00a0 They were supplied what were probably deliberate misstatements of fact by ASAN.\u00a0 It is very sad that these people have to stoop to dishonesty to get their way and close out sane people who want to end the pain and suffering that this horrible disorder causes.\u00a0 All I can say is booo hisss, razzz. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticadvocacy.org/2014/10/asan-applauds-congressional-letter-urging-self-advocate-inclusion/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2014/10/gadfly-boos-congressional-letter-and.html", "title": "\nGadfly boos congressional letter and neurodiversity's and ASAN's dishonest talking points \n"},
{"date": " November 9, 2014", "body": "\nI suppose the story about Seinfeld stating that he believes he's someplace on the autism spectrum isn't going to die down anytime soon (at least a few more days).\u00a0 So, perhaps this post is overkill, but I'd like to add some of my thoughts on the comments of various high profile persons and organizations involved with autism who don't seem to mind trivializing the disability that makes life so hard for so many of us.\n\nAri Ne'eman stated that Seinfeld's self-diagnosis shows that the autism community is larger and more diverse than most people realize and sends a positive message.\u00a0 He believes it helps someone at a job who has not disclosed their autism diagnosis to their employer and co-workers not have the stigma of this condition.\u00a0 He also implies that stigma rather than disability or impairment is what limits opportunities for those on the spectrum.\u00a0 He believes that it will build greater tolerance of autism. I don't think most people will actually believe the comedian has any sort of ASD and autism is still autism, Ari.\u00a0 It's still going to disable people from working, finding relationships, etc.\u00a0 Whatever stigma exists is still going to be there.\u00a0 People still won't tolerate behavioral problems from autism, including the neurodiversity movement's opinions of people like Christian Weston Chandler.\u00a0 Loud voices, poor social skills, meltdowns in public places will still exist and Seinfeld's comments won't change that. \n\nAuthor and autism advocate John Elder Robison\u00a0 has also gotten into the act\u00a0 in the linked essay he wrote for his Psychology Today blog.\u00a0 He states that he believes it's a good thing that important, well-known people identify with autism and he elaborates. \n\nMr. Seinfeld\u2019s speculation that he \u201cmay be on the spectrum,\u201d may be the \nfirst step in an actual diagnosis or evaluation, and it may be a \nmilestone of his journey of self-discovery. Many people are critical of \nself -diagnosis, but the fact is, most adult diagnoses start by people \nasking themselves, \u201cmight I be autistic?\u201d\u00a0 Seldom are adults handed this\n diagnosis out of the blue.\u00a0 So before we attack self-diagnosis let\u2019s \nremember that\u2019s how \u201creal diagnosis\u201d begins for many adults.\n\nSomehow I doubt that Seinfeld will see a psychologist or psychiatrist for a formal diagnosis as it does not affect his abilities in any way and he would have sought professional help for his lack of social understanding and taking things literally if he'd thought it were warranted.\u00a0 The same is true of\u00a0 neurodiversity poster boy Vernon Smith who self-diagnosed himself with a Simon Baron Cohen AQ quiz.\u00a0 Yes, I'm critical of self-diagnosis, because until someone is diagnosed by a trained clinician, that's all it is, a self-diagnosis, even if people start out with that and it remains so until validated by a professional.\u00a0 It trivializes people who really have the condition and suffer.\u00a0 I wonder about the people who never received diagnosis until adulthood.\u00a0 Were they nonverbal as children, didn't their parents know something was wrong with them?\u00a0 Did they attempt to get a diagnosis for something even if they're middle aged in a time that diagnosis was not well known?\u00a0 These are points to ponder.\n\nI won't comment on Robison's other talking points further, as they are the same old, same old and I've discussed them previously. \n\nSuch insensitive commentary is par for the course from both Ne'eman and Robison.\u00a0 We've been hearing this stuff from them for years, so it comes as no surprise.\u00a0 But what about other people whom Gadfly believes should know better? \n\nLiz Feld, president of Autism Speaks had the following to say:\n\n\u00a0\u201cthere are many people on the autism spectrum who can relate to Jerry\u2019s heartfelt comments about his own experiences.\u201d\u00a0\n\nTo me, this is an insensitive statement since Jerry's rational for believing that he's on the spectrum certainly doesn't reflect with diaper wearing head bangers or even the much higher functioning people who actually have legitimate diagnoses who can't hold down a job or get a date.\u00a0 But I suppose I shouldn't be surprised at this statement from an organization that would have John Elder Robison on their science advisory board, fund Laurent Mottron and support Alex Plank's Autism Talk TV.\u00a0 However, autism speaks does promote the idea that they're interested in curing autism on their walks and fundraisers and on their web page (Though I'm wondering if they really feel that way) so don't know why they'd trivialize the condition that they want to raise money to understand and ameliorate. \n \n\nAutism Society of America President Scott Badesch  also commented\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRecently, Jerry Seinfeld is suggesting he might be on the autism \nspectrum. For so many of us, Jerry has been an amazing person who has \nmade us laugh and taught us many lessons about life.\n\n\n\n\nHe is a wonderful person and if he is in fact an individual on the \nspectrum, we are delighted that he will be an example for everyone to \nsee the beauty, intelligence, skill, and everything else that defines so\n many who live with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\nThere is nothing beautiful about autism.\u00a0 It is a horrible disorder that afflicts people in a pernicious manner.\u00a0 It is disappointing that the leader of a large Autism group would say things like that, but I suppose I should not be surprised that an organization that would support Ari Ne'eman being on the National Disabilities Council and have Alex Plank has a keynote speaker at one of their conferences.\n\nAs I said before, Ne'eman and Robison's insensitivity are par for the course for them so not quite as shocking.\u00a0 But it is hurtful (at least to me) that these other two organizations who I'd think would be interested in helping people afflicted with autism would make such cavalier statements. \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/autism-advocates-hope-jerry-seinfelds-words-help-fight-stigma-n243636", "http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/my-life-aspergers/201411/jerry-seinfeld-and-autism", "http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2014/11/08/Jerry-Seinfeld-Praised-By-Autism-Community-For-Revealing-He-May-Be-On-The-Spectrum"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2014/11/certain-autism-advocates-cavalier.html", "title": "\ncertain autism advocates cavalier attitude about Seinfeld's self-diagnosis  \n"},
{"date": " October 20, 2013", "body": "\nAs I posted previously, John Robison has a new gig teaching a course on neurodiversity (along with some other people) at the historic institution William and Mary College.\u00a0 \n\nApparently, inquiring minds wanted to know\u00a0exactly what Mr. Robison's stance on neurodiversity is.\u00a0 He wrote a post about his efforts at his attempt to oblige them.\n\nOn neurodiversity:\u00a0 \nI believe neurodiversity is the idea that neurological differences like autism \nand ADHD are the result of normal, natural variation in the human genome.  This \nrepresents a new and fundamentally different way of looking at conditions that \nwere traditionally pathologized; it\u2019s a viewpoint that is not universally \naccepted though it is increasingly supported by science.\n\nDoes this mean that Robison believes that mutations such as fragile X, Rett's syndrome, Angleman's syndrome, etc. are natural variations such as genes for eye and hair color and height are?\u00a0 Though there are variations in height that probably follow a normal distribution, someone extremely short, such as a dwarf. may have a genetic mutation or disease.\u00a0 Does Robison discount possible environmental influences on autism, such as thalidomide exposure, cocaine ingestion that appear to have some association with at least some spectrum disorders?\u00a0 What about cancers, such as the BRCA mutation that is found in breast cancers.\u00a0 Are cancers natural variations.\u00a0 Then why don't we have oncodiversity or cellular diversity as a philosophy? \u00a0He makes a completely inconsistent statement in the next paragraph:\u00a0 \n\nWe are realizing that autism, ADHD, and other conditions emerge through a \ncombination of genetic predisposition and environmental interaction; they are \nnot exclusively the result of disease or injury.\u00a0 Which is it, autism is a natural genetic variation or in some cases it is a disease or injury?\u00a0 As my former psychoanalyst used to say, you can't have your cake and eat it too, Mr. Robison. \n\nHe makes a very offensive statement next:\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\nWe are not sick.  We are different. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDoes Robison believe that a child who can't speak, soils themselves, engages in self-injury and wanders away so that their life is endangered is not sick?\u00a0 If that is the case, why did he join the scientific advisory board of autism speaks and reviews grants for the government to study autism if it is just a difference?\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\nFaculty and staff are just as likely to have different brains, especially in the \nsciences.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe trivializes autism by comparing college professors to those that really suffer from this affliction.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\nwhile working to remediate disability has as its goal the best possible life \nquality. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf someone is disabled then why aren't they sick?\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen a fellow has one leg, and he wants to get around on his own, we don\u2019t say, \n\u201cHe needs a cure.\u201d  We say, \u201cHe needs help remediating his \ndisability.\u201d\n\n\nWho says this?\u00a0 I've never heard of limb diversity or mobility diversity.\u00a0 Why doesn't someone need a cure to have a leg restored, even if one is not available given the current science?\u00a0 Robison then goes on to compare the use of a cane or prosthesis to remediating autism, but gives no examples of how this can be done.\u00a0 As far as\u00a0I can tell, Robison has not suggested how autism could be remediated.\u00a0 If it were completely remediated why wouldn't this constitute a cure?\u00a0 Again, Mr. Robison, you can't have your cake and eat it too.\u00a0 \n\nNo neurodiversity advocate in his right mind would oppose developing tools to \nremediate disability from autism.\n\nIt would appear then that most neurodiversity advocates are not in their right minds, since they consistently say that acceptance and accommodations are the solutions to autism and in at least some cases that autism would not even be a disability if this were done.\u00a0Or some say the problem should be ignored altogether like Ari Ne'eman's statement that social pleasantry should be eliminated as a criteria in hiring and evaluating people's job performance.\u00a0 \n\nRobison then goes on with the offensive stereotypes of how autistic eccentricity is associated with high intelligence or giftedness.\u00a0 \n\nIt is appalling that William and Mary would offer a course in this and would enlist someone who did not even finish the tenth grade to help teach this.\u00a0 \n\nHopefully a cure for autism will be found someday and perhaps now we can add at least some amputees on the list of people that Robison manages to trivialize.\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2013/10/john-robison-to-teach-course-on.html", "http://www.jerobison.blogspot.com/2013/10/neurodiversity-and-me-few-questions.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2013/10/john-robisons-take-on-neurodiversity.html", "title": "\nJohn Robison's take on neurodiversity \n"},
{"date": " December 11, 2014", "body": "\nSeveral months ago it was announced that Autism Speaks had partnered with Google to sequence of the genomes of 10,000 persons on the autism spectrum and their family members. \u00a0It was hoped that the project would find clues to the etiology of at least some forms of autism as it is quite possible if not probable that they partially originate from some form of genetic mutations. \n\nWhen I first heard about the partnership between AS and Google I wondered if, to be consistent, whether or not the members of neurodiversity would boycott Google. \u00a0If they urge boycotts of other organizations involved with autism speaks perhaps they should not use a google search engine, not use blogger blogs and never again view or post a video on youtube. \u00a0As far as I know, none of them have done this yet. \u00a0Nor, to the best of my knowledge, have they written a letter to Google urging them to severe ties with the organization they hate so much as they've done with Sesame Street and other groups who have had an association with autism speaks. \u00a0Or even if they would claim that this project would result in eugenics. \u00a0Now, apparently they have taken some action. \u00a0 \n\nAutism Speaks has used a promotional gimmick to advertise this partnership of using the term mssng with certain letters deliberately omitted. \u00a0They have also used #mssng as a hash tag on twitter. \u00a0They apparently meant that certain information was missing in autism and were not directing it at autistic people. \u00a0Only hoping that missing answers could be found to help autistic people. \n\nPredictably, members of the neurodiversity movement have taken umbrage. \u00a0They have responded angrily, that they are not mssng, there is nothing wrong with them, autism speaks are evil ogres who are insulting them and are even trying to destroy them. \u00a0They have added their own hash tag on twitter, #notmssng. \n\nOthers have provided more tempered responses stating that what is mssng are supports and services. \u00a0At the forefront of this is one of ND's most prominent proponents John Elder Robison. \u00a0He's written a response to the mssng campaign. \u00a0Interestingly enough he states that he favors genetic research of this sort, but says it would not be a priority of his. \u00a0Then he goes on to state we are spending money in the wrong places and should not be looking at the \"autism riddle\". \u00a0He states that we need therapies and other services to fill in the gap and that these are obtainable. \u00a0He not only stated that there should be funding for these endeavors, but that it should be administered by autistic people. \u00a0If he has such great ideas with all of his money, power and influence, and he does not agree with Autism Speaks' spending priorities why he doesn't start his own 501(c) \u00a0organization and attempt to do this and fund certain projects or suggest what and how they can be funded? \u00a0How can someone disabled by autism be accommodated so they can have a job, a lifetime partner and other goals. \u00a0How can a nonverbal autistic be treated and accommodated so that they can speak? \u00a0What research can be done that will help autistic people in the here and now, since Robison complains that genetic research will not help anyone in the foreseeable future. \n\nASAN is now a 501(c) organization run exclusively by autistic people, exactly the type of enterprise that Robison is talking about. \u00a0They have made similar claims that acceptance and accommodations will solve everything and that if AS spent their money more wisely we could achieve the goals that Robison has discussed. \u00a0In Gadfly's opinion, ASAN has failed miserably in this regard. \u00a0I have read their stuff and yet, I can't recall them having written what accommodations and therapies can help autistic people. \u00a0They only want to tear down autism speaks and persons, like myself, who want to find a cure. \u00a0They demonstrate against autism speaks and talk about how terrible it is, yet don't seem to want to provide any solutions of their own the problems autism causes, regardless of whether it's a medical disability or a social disability. \u00a0Out of their $300,000 dollar budget $65,000 alone goes just to pay Ari Ne'eman's salary. \u00a0Much of the rest of the money goes to other staff members pay and rents on offices.\n\nI realize that ASAN's response to this is that since people wrongly perceive autism to be a disease or a defect rather than neurodiversity's description of an alternative form of brain wiring they will donate money to autism speaks and if ASAN had the millions that AS does and not merely a few hundred grand in assets perhaps they could provide research into supports and accommodations and therapies that would help autistics now and not decades from now. \u00a0I don't believe that poor capitalization is an excuse. \u00a0I'm still waiting for suggestions from Robison, ASAN, or any other members of the ND movement for that matter as how this can be done. \u00a0They are saliently lacking in those suggestions.\n\n\n\u00a0Will the ND movement at some point in time provide the #mssng link?

Dr. C is troubled as I am at the power and influence these people have wielded as of late. \n\nIronically enough, Dr. C poses the following question: \u00a0Do they believe that the inability to get or hold a job infers a flaw in that person's character?\n\nI'm reminded of the \u00a0\nwords of retired neurodiversity blogger \"The autistic bitch from hell\"  \n\n\nThese people are truly pathetic. They have been called weirdos and dummies all their lives, and deep down, they believe that's what they are. They cling to their autism diagnosis like it's a security blanket that protects them from ever having to take responsibility to improve their lives. They reflexively oppose any efforts by autistic activists to raise the issue of employment discrimination because they fear that they will lose their disability payments if other autistic people get jobs. They will grovel at the feet of any bureaucrat who can give them a benefit check, pat them sweetly on their incompetent little heads, and reassure them that they're not to blame for any of their failures because their poor defective brains weren't capable of anything better.\n\nSo, if this is the opinion of mainstream neurodiversity, the answer to Dr. C's question would appear to be a resounding yes. \u00a0This person has been rumored to be Meg Evans, who with Ari Ne'eman, cofounded the autistic self advocacy network, the premiere neurodiversity organization, some of whose members have power and influence in the government and have persuaded\u00a0members of congress to write false statements to the secretary of HHS and others to get what they want. \u00a0Apparently these congress people and their staffs are either too slothful to even do the most rudimentary fact checking or perhaps they are members of ND themselves and are opposed to ending this horrific nightmare which affects so many of us. \n\nUnfortunately, Dr. C seems to have a friendly relationship with John Robison and seems to think this individual has something useful to offer the autism community and that is unfortunate. \u00a0I won't comment any further. \u00a0I'll just let Dr. C's post speak for itself. \u00a0 I hope as many people as possible will read it and take it to heart, though I doubt few people will. \n\nTo me, the word 'neurodiversity' is just as offensive as the word 'retard' the n word for blacks and the F word for gay people. \u00a0I think the rhetoric of the autistic bitch from hell speaks for itself. \n\nI only wish more people would call out this horrid movement. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://corticalchauvinism.com/2015/01/05/the-neurodiversity-movement-lack-of-trust/", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2006/02/autistic-uncle-toms.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2015/01/neuroscienist-manuel-casanova-calls-out.html", "title": "\nNeuroscienist Manuel Casanova calls out the Neurodiversity movement  \n"},

{"date": " February 21, 2015", "body": "\n\nThorne Sorkil\u2019s organization, Specialisterne (meaning specialist in Danish) trains and employs individuals to be computer software testers. \u00a0What is unique about the employees is that they are mostly persons on the autism spectrum. \u00a0Sorkil, a former IT worker in Denmark, has an autistic son who I think is now about eighteen. \u00a0He found that his son could draw maps with great detail. \u00a0He also had calendar savant skills. \u00a0Sorkil met a number of individuals on the autism spectrum through various support groups who all related the stories of being unable to find and/or hold down a job. \u00a0Studies, such as Michelle Dawson\u2019s, had suggested that the intelligence of persons with autism had been underestimated and they had good fluid intelligence. \u00a0Also autistics were believed to have good attention to details (as Thorkil\u2019s son did). \u00a0A study by Patricia Howlin had showed that as many as 30% of autistics have specialized skills and talents. \u00a0This was a higher estimate than Bernard Rimland\u2019s survey showing merely 10% of autistics have savant skills of some sort. \u00a0This inspired him to start Specialisterne where persons on the autism spectrum do IT work. \n\nThe concept really hit home for me. \u00a0As most regular readers of my blog know, during the approximately twenty-eight years I was in the workforce I had tremendous problems at jobs. \u00a0These included conflicts with employees and supervisors and often not being able to do the work without errors. \u00a0An organization that can effectively employ autistic people and provide them with a good income was something that interested me. \nHis organization has received widespread media attention from the new york times as well as Forbes magazine . \u00a0Is this organization the salvation for unemployed autistic people or could it be not all the media has cracked it up to be?\n\nOne of the media\u2019s talking points in their stories of this organization was that autistics not only had good attention to details but had superior accuracy. \u00a0I know this was not true for myself. \u00a0This made me skeptical of Specialisterne\u2019s legitimacy and whether or not they were really helpful to persons on the spectrum. \n\nOther dubious assertions were using Michelle Dawson\u2019s research to show that autistic people could effectively work as software testers. \u00a0The control group in her study was not neurotypical, but had average Wechsler IQ\u2019s of 70th percentile. \u00a0A group in the 70th percentile is not typical of anything. \u00a0No other researcher had replicated the magnitude of the differences in autistics between the Wechsler test and RPM\u2019s her study found. \u00a0Sven Boelte found a difference between RPM and Wechsler but it was not of the magnitude of Dawson\u2019s and was only limited to lower functioning autistics and not persons with higher functioning autism and asperger\u2019s who are whom Specialisterne employs. \u00a0Kim Bodner also failed to find an effect for high functioning autistics. \u00a0The attention to details, as measured by embedded figures test seemed to be \ndebunked by psychologist Sarah White, particularly for higher functioning persons. \u00a0Darold Treffert wrote in Islands of Genius that Howlin\u2019s 30 percent figure was likely a very liberal definition of savantism and an overestimate. \u00a0 \n\nThe biggest eyeroll of all was reading that Specialisterne was largely subsidized by the socialist government of Denmark. \u00a0When he set up shop in the u.s.a. in the state of Delaware, he received grants of $800,000. \n\nAll of these made me question whether or not these were real jobs and they were geniunely helping those with autism. \n\nThis is why I was interested when a couple of days ago I received a comment to a  a post\u00a0 I wrote over two and a half years ago where I discussed these very issues. \u00a0From a woman named Katja Worm who said she was from Denmark and had been a former employee of specialisterne said:\n\nHello, my name is Katja Worm. I'm an 35 year old woman and a former employee at Specialisterne in Denmark.\nI just wanna say you're right about everything you wrote in your blog. I share your opinion. I really do.\nYou can't run a business by using this method. And you can't demand an amount in that size, and just believe that the government and the social services will pay it. It's not gonna Work in a long run. You have to make Money by yourself from selling a product or something like that. And they're not doing something like that at Specialisterne. They have some contact with other Companies, but the Company is staying in business by getting Money from the government. It's not okay. It's a scam.\nDuring that same time, I was working there, it didn't seem like anyone got a real job.\nAll we were doing was sitting and playing with a cell phone and talk to a psychologist. It doesn't have anything to do with creating a career in the business World. The employees were not affective at all. They were only doing one assigntment which took them all day to finish.\nThe employees didn't get any professional training in social skills either. They were allowed to show their autistic behaviour in public by sitting and do rocking and spinning movements with their body, which is a classical sign of autism. If they're showing this strange behaviour at a Work place, it's no Wonder, if they can't keep a job.\n\nMs. Worm didn\u2019t leave a link of any kind. \u00a0She just posted as anonymous. \u00a0I have no way of verifying if her claims are real but it is food for thought. \u00a0Is Thorne Sorkil an emperor with no clothes? \n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/magazine/the-autism-advantage.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&pagewanted=all&adxnnlx=1424552636-N4kNdcBRPhXyzx1ffR/sSw&", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/techonomy/2013/10/28/creating-great-employees-who-happen-to-be-autistic"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2015/02/is-specialisterne-for-real.html", "title": "\nIs Specialisterne for real?  \n"},

{"date": " August 26, 2015", "body": "\nSteve Silberman's neurotribes has just come out and is getting a lot of media hype and so far it's a huge commercial success.\u00a0 I've been waiting for years to read this book and now that I have I can blog about it.\n\nFirst off, I said that I wouldn't judge a book by its cover though I did have some expectations as to what it would be based on the company the author keeps and the variety of things that he's written on the internet.\u00a0 I'd like to say I couldn't help having some preconceptions about the book and I have to concede that they were at least partially wrong.\u00a0 It was not the neurodiversity preachathon that I expected it to be nor did promoting the assortive mating theory play a prominent role in the book which Silberman wrote about in his Wired magazine article.\u00a0 Nor was it as offensive as I'd thought it would be.\u00a0 Though some parts of the book were offensive and there were plenty of other problems with it (which I'll get to in due course) that merited a one star review on amazon,\u00a0\u00a0 Now that I've admitted some of my prejudgements were wrong, I'd like to write some commentary on the book that I could not cover alone in my scathing one star review.\n\nThough Silberman's writing was very readable, the book was arthritic tortoise in its pacing.\u00a0 Silberman writes a lot of minutiae and back story in each segment which was extremely plodding and made for some dull reading and took an eternity to really cut to the chase of his topics.\u00a0 It was also very verbose and I believe a good editor (which apparently he didn't have at avery penguin or in the process of writing the book) would have cut it by about 50% as he could have expressed ideas in about half the words he wrote.\u00a0 The writing is also very verbose and long-winded.\u00a0 The book is also poorly organized as it flits from one arcane topic to another with no arbitrary order he goes from talking about Wakefield or Rimland for a while (giving superfluous backstory on each subject that causes the book to drag) then out of the blue goes on to nonsequiters about IT individuals and what they did with computers which would seem to have no relevance to the subject matter, except he wants to imply that these persons are autistic or at least have autistic traits and goes on about these people.\n\nHe first writes about the refrigerator mother theories of the etiology of autism that were espoused by Kanner, Bettelheim and other lesser known individuals (including my own psychoanalyst).\u00a0 He writes from the perspective of how historically undesirable they are and then tries to suggest that we've evolved to neurodiversity which is more desirable.\n\nI'm curious as to whether or not Silberman could have interviewed a middle aged adult who had actually experienced this era first-hand.\u00a0 I personally fit this bill.\u00a0 As I've written before on this blog, I was in psychoanalysis for more than ten years by a therapist who studied under Anna Freud who suggested among other things that the etiology of my autism was due to castration anxiety, due to the fact that I had a younger sister and I must have seen her nude and noted her lack of a male organ.\u00a0 She stated I believed I thought my parents planned to be like Lorena Bobbit and this was in part the cause of the etiology of my problems.\u00a0 This was also traumatic to my parents.\n\nIronically, though the author implies that in the twenty-first century, we've evolved from this bad history to the concept of neurodiversity which he embraces wholeheartedly not only in this book but in various other places on the internet as well in the five years he spent writing this treatise.\n\nThe truth is neurodiversity is in part a twenty-first century incarnation of this sad period with some of its less savory members saying the reason I'm depressed over my autism is that I had a horrible domineering mother who taught me to hate myself.\u00a0 Others have said this is where my disability from autism comes from.\u00a0 A few of these people have called my mother a witch and a yapping shrew.\n\nOthers have not resorted to name calling but in the case of John Elder Robison have stated that parents might want to do a treatment just for their own convenience and not to help their child as he stated on Harold Doherty's blog.\u00a0 Others have equated a cure to intolerance, others have said that autistic parents don't give a f*** about their children and wish they'd drop dead.\u00a0 Others have equated parents of autistic children or certain charitable autistic organizations with the Ku Klux Klan and parents of autistic people as akin to members of the KKK who are forced to raise black children.\u00a0 These include IACC member Noah Britton.\n\nSilberman also does not come right out and say that Henry Cavendish and other notable scientists had autism, but certainly implies it and if you read between the lines implies autistic type thinking was responsible for many scientific discoveries and inventions.\u00a0 He is not a clinician and Cavendish died nearly 150 years before he was born, so i'm rather perplexed as to how the author can come to these conclusions.\u00a0 It's true Cavendish was very shy and eccentric but obviously he did not have executive functioning problems of an autistic. \u00a0 \n\nThe author repeated his offensive statement (that i've commented on previously) that the difference between autism and a non-handicapped person is analogous to the difference between a linux and a windows operating system that just work differently.\u00a0 A more accurate analogy would be between a working computer that runs windows and a computer that constantly crashes or has constant blue screens of death and shuts down due to overheating or having malfunctioning memory chips.\n\nAnother offensive comment is implying that the problems with autism come from oppression rather than disability as was the case with Jews at one time (and possibly still in some circumstances).\u00a0 He states in this analogy that autistics are a relevant minority group as there are as many autistics as Jews in the U.S.A.\u00a0 according to one source at least 2.2% of Americans are Jewish.\u00a0 Even if you go by the CDC's 1 in 68 figure (which many including Silberman himself misrepresent) and assume this figure applies to people in all age groups,\u00a0 there are still more Jews than autistics in the U.S.A.\u00a0 The 1 in 68 figure only applied to one birth cohort in 2002 when they were eight years old.\u00a0 This assumes that the prevalence rate is the same in all age groups for which there is no proof.\u00a0 The CDC and others have changing prevalence figures all the time based on changing definitions of autism and the locations where they actually look for autistics which change every two years.\u00a0 The 2.2-3% Jewish figure has held up over time for decades.\u00a0 As a member of both groups (I'm both autistic and Jewish) I not only find Silberman's analogy offensive but it is outright wrong.\n\nIn the last chapter he trivializes mark rimland's very serious handicaps by stating that the support he gets from family and community are far better for him than a cure would be.\u00a0 I've met mark rimland at an autism conference and he is quite handicapped.\u00a0 He'll never be able to take care of himself and will need lifelong aides to care for his every need and take care of him constantly.\u00a0 If his name were Mark Smith or Mark Jones and his father had not been a well-known figure in the autism community, he'd never have been able to promote his artwork and he would never have received the support that Silberman cites.\n\nSilberman also lauds specilisterne as a solution for the employment problems of autistics though it was only able to exist through subsidies from the socialist government of denmark and grants from the state of delaware and has never been able to offer real and sustainable revenue and employment of autistic people and has lost money.\u00a0 \n\nHe also claims there are all sort of services and accommodations that can help autistic people and that we should not be spending time on scientific research to help autistic people.\u00a0 For the most part, he's vague as to what these are or how they can be workable.\u00a0 I contend that no accommodations will help autistics get around the disabling aspects of their condition.\n\nMost of the autistic people Silberman wrote about in his book are at the mildest end of the spectrum (assuming they're autistic at all).\n\nIt's sad that Silberman's book will inevitably be such a commercial success and get all the notoriety it continues to receive and that people will get the wrong idea about autism and what a horrible disability it truly is and how much we need to do scientific research to find the cause, find viable treatments and ultimately cure this devastating disease.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2010/03/autism-speaks-welcomes-to-its-board.html",

{"date": " March 30, 2015", "body": "\nI see that the Autistic self Advocacy Network has started a new fundraising campaign. They give the potential donor three choices of causes to donate to.\n\nThe first is an autism campus inclusion summer leadership training program.\u00a0 The apparent purpose of this is to train and indoctrinate college students in organizing others to spread the neurodiversity message.\u00a0 The Mitsubishi corporation has already funded this endeavor of ASAN's in the past.\u00a0 According to a post written by The canary party, an offshot of the anti-vax movement and one of the few organizations that actively opposes the neurodiversity movement, having a formal diagnosis of autism is not required for a college student to participate in this program.  Only self-identification of being on the autism spectrum is required.  We also have this announcement of the program by ASAN a few years back where they stated: \u00a0\nThis \nis an exciting move forward for ASAN and we hope it can be an exciting \nmove forward for you. If you are a current college undergraduate student\nwho identifies on the Autism Spectrum, including Autistic Disorder, \nAsperger's Syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise \nSpecified, with a strong interest in the Disability Rights and Autistic \nRights movements, we invite you to apply for this leadership training.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Gadfly is intrigued by the words who identifies.\u00a0 Does this mean that any Tom, Dick, or Harry (or Harriet) can just diagnose themselves with autism and be eligible for the program? \u00a0 There have been some questions in the past as to whether or not some of the more prominent members of ASAN are self-diagnosed.\u00a0 One of the commenters on this blog claimed that Paula Durbin Westby told him in 2007 that she was self-diagnosed.\u00a0 Of course, I have no way of verifying this claim or any other allegations of members of ASAN self-diagnosing themselves, however, this program seems (at least to me) to suggest that there is evidence that ASAN does in fact encourage self-diagnosis.\n\nThe second choice is to donate to ASAN's Policy advocacy arm.\u00a0 Here they are trying to encourage policy against restraint and seclusion, discrimination in organ transplantation and paying subminimum wage to disabled people.\n\nThough restraining and secluding autistic children may sound like a rights violation, it is actually for their own protection.\u00a0 There have been several reports of autistic children wandering and being hit by cars and accidental drownings.\u00a0 ASAN does not seem to care or have any alternative for preventing these tragic deaths, except to claim that if neurodiversity were implemented, we could find out what is causing children to wander and deal with it.\u00a0 Of course, they provide no evidence of this.\n\nAs far as organ transplantation is concerned the sad truth is that there are only a finite number of hearts, kidneys, etcetera to go around and the demand for organ transplantation exceeds the supply.\u00a0 If every autistic person who needed a new heart or kidney was granted one, some other person would be denied and they would die.\u00a0 This could be an example of reverse discrimination.\u00a0 In order for organ transplantation to be effective and save or prolong the life of the recipient, a strict regimen of medication, diet, etc. must be adhered to.\u00a0 Sometimes a disabled person might not be able to do this and they'll end up dying or wasting the organ that could have gone to someone else who would follow the regimen and be able to best utilize this scarce resource.\u00a0 From what I've read cadavaric transplantation may be underutilized, but I don't see Ari Ne'eman crusading for this.\u00a0 One of the problems here is that the hospital or ethics committee who rejected the candidate for transplantation is barred by the HIPPA law from telling their side of the story as it would violate patient confidentiality.\u00a0 I wish there were a solution where every person who needed an organ transplant could get one but unfortunately there is not one.\u00a0 Gadfly would be at the front of the line in protest, if someone were denying someone a needed life saving treatment just because they happened to be prejudiced against autistic persons.\u00a0 ASAN has failed miserably (at least in my opinion) to prove that this is the case.\n\nIn terms of subminimum wage laws, most of the organizations that pay subminimum wages are 501(c)'s such as the Goodwill who are just creating makework for people with disabilities who would not have anything to do.\u00a0 Getting rid of these might actually be a good thing as Gadfly is not really a fan of sheltered workshops for a variety of reasons.\u00a0 As far as the profit sector goes, legally they can pay a disabled person subminimum wage, but there is a burdensome bureaucratic process the employer must go through and much paperwork and proof has to be provided to show the handicapped person is not worth $8.00 an hour (or whatever the minimum wage is).\u00a0 I suspect most employers would not find this worth their while and they'd just hire a non-handicapped person and pay them minimum wage. \u00a0 I might agree with ASAN that the subminimum wage law for disabled people should be done away with.\u00a0 However, the problem is that if this happened, Goodwill and other organizations would get rid of the sheltered workshops and the employers would just hire a non-disabled person for the minimum wage job. It would do nothing to improve employment opportunities for persons on the spectrum.\n\nThe last program you can donate to is something that combats stereotypes and misinformation about autism being a tragedy or a burden to families.\u00a0 I believe that it is ASAN that fosters stereotypes and misinformation about autistic people.\u00a0 One supporter stated that those who disagree with them should be shot to death or turned into cat food.\u00a0 ASAN leads to stereotypes of\u00a0 autistic people being abusive bullies and hate mongers who end up insulting someone's mother if they have no other way of winning an argument.\u00a0 We are not monsters but I believe ASAN makes us look like monsters. \u00a0 \n\nFor these reasons, I don't believe that ASAN is a cause worth donating to and I hope anyone who reads this post will find some other more worthwhile charity.\u00a0 Somehow I doubt I'll convince many people.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticadvocacy.tumblr.com/post/115034736259/asan-is-excited-to-announce-a-new-fundraising", "http://www.canaryparty.org/index.php/the-news/108-mitsubishi-funds-group-that-opposes-preventing-or-curing-autism", "http://myemail.constantcontact.com/ASAN-Invites-Autistic-Students-to-Participate-in-Leadership-Training.html?soid=1104220830834&aid=S09w4EH1lyA"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2015/03/autistic-self-advocacy-networks-new.html", "title": "\nAutistic self advocacy Network's new fundraising campaign \n"},
{"date": " March 3, 2015", "body": "\nSince my profile, which included my anti-neurodiversity activities, was published in Newsweek, neurodiversity has begun to become the topic du jour in the autism world.\u00a0 In what I suspect was in response to Erika Hayasaki's article about me, The Daily Beast published an article about neurodiversity.\u00a0 This article was very sympathetic to the ND movement and did not even make an attempt at faux balance.\u00a0 The Canadian public radio show Day 6 interviewed both Ari Ne'eman and myself (along with a few other guests) about the subject of neurodiversity.\u00a0 Autism Daily Newscast has called for articles from those on the spectrum about neurodiversity.\u00a0 \n\nInterestingly enough, MTV got into the act and also wrote a pro-neurodiversity article with no effort at balance.\u00a0 This article also highlighted the #autismspeaks10 war that some of neurodiversity's more bellicose members created on twitter.\u00a0 Mysteriously, the article was taken down from MTV's website provoking the ire of a variety of members of neurodiversity.\u00a0 Article author Robin Lempel offered the explanation that she had tried to contact Autism Speaks to provide balance for the article and had been unable to do so.\u00a0 \n\nPart of the problem was that neurodiversity activist Amy Sequenzia basically demanded that MTV publish quotes and comments she made for the article verbatim with no editing whatsoever.\u00a0 MTV neglected to do this. \u00a0 This apparently made Ms. Sequenzia very angry.  She also made the questionable claim that 97% of Autism Speaks money goes only to pay salaries.  Yet, she seems to have no objection to the fact that Ari Ne'eman increased his own salary for running ASAN by 62% in one year and that his $65,000 annual salary in 2012 was nearly 20% of all of ASAN's assets.  Not to mention of course other salaries ASAN pays and the costs of their rent and overhead with the very limited assets that they have, which, as far as I can tell, goes to nothing to help autistic people.\u00a0 Perhaps this made MTV rather angry and this was one reason they decided not to keep the article on their website. \n\nThere is perhaps another reason that has been overlooked so far by everyone who has written about MTV's ephemeral neurodiversity piece.\u00a0 MTV may\u00a0 indirectly be in a partnership with autism speaks in the same manner as build-a-bear, Lindt chocolates and all of the other organizations that members of the neurodiversity movement have urged the public to boycott.\u00a0 The Night of Too Many Stars which helped raise funds for Autism Speaks aired on the Comedy Channel.\u00a0 The Comedy Channel's parent company is Viacom, interestingly the same organization that owns MTV.\u00a0 Perhaps this is why they wanted a balanced article and a response from autism speaks.\u00a0 Perhaps Autism Speaks fundraisers have helped generate revenue for Viacom along with its subsidiaries the Comedy Channel and MTV.\n\nSince many members of the neurodiversity movement have urged boycotts of build a bear, Lindt Chocolate, Sesame Street and other organizations that have supported autism speaks, I wonder why in the world would they want MTV to write an article about them when it is owned by a parent company who has subsidiaries which fully support AS?\n\nOf course, one could also ask the question of why when Google partnered with autism speaks on the genome project, why various neurodiversity proponents did not urge a boycott of Google.\u00a0 I wonder how many members of neurodiversity have given up looking at you tube, using gmail accounts, and stopped blogging on blogger which is owned by Google.\u00a0 I suspect not very many and I have not seen neurodiversity urge a boycott of Google.\u00a0 Or why they thought it was okay for Laurent Mottron and Michelle Dawson to receive their nearly half million dollar grant from AS.\u00a0 Or why it was okay for Wrongplanet.net and Autism Talk TV to obtain support from autism speaks.\u00a0 In fairness to some Wrong Planet denizens though, I will concede that some of them posted frustration over Alex Plank's choice to jump on the AS bandwagon.\n\nAll I can say to \u00a0members of the ND movement is perhaps you should watch your actions and be careful of associating with organizations that support autism speaks if all you want to do is rant and rave on twitter and other social media outlets how bad they are.\u00a0 Perhaps you can stop being so nasty, mean and insulting.\u00a0 If you guys aren't more careful, perhaps it can come around and bite you in the ass.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/25/they-don-t-want-an-autism-cure.html", "http://autismwomensnetwork.org/disabled-people-being-silenced-by-unethical-media/", "http://www.cc.com/shows/night-of-too-many-stars"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2015/03/mtv-bites-neurodiversity-in-ass.html", "title": "\nMTV bites neurodiversity in the ass \n"},

{"date": " September 23, 2015", "body": "\nThe main belief of the neurodiversity movement is that autism is a naturally occurring genetic variation.\u00a0 The differences in the brains of autistic persons versus those of\u00a0 \"neurotypicals\" are no more significant than differences between blondes and brunettes.\u00a0 A common belief is that numerous genes in small amounts accrue certain evolutionary benefits but in large amounts cause autism.\u00a0 According to Simon Baron-Cohen and Temple Grandin the reason autism has stayed in the population despite the fact that autistic people usually don't have children is that it\u00a0 has traits that are adaptive and have evolutionary value.\u00a0 For example attention to detail as measured by the embedded figures test, high scores on the block design test and pattern recognition.\u00a0 Grandin has gone so far as to say that we'd all be cavemen if it weren't for autism genes.\n\nNew research from the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York would seem to refute that contention.\u00a0 The scientists found that a number of cases of autism to be caused by rare genetic mutations in vulnerable genes.\u00a0 These mutations were spontaneous, and due to the fact that autistics rarely reproduce these mutations don't stay in the population.\u00a0 In some cases, they were transmitted by the mother who was less vulnerable to the mutation and did not become autistic. \u00a0  Here is the study in its entirety in case anyone is interested in reading it.  I read it, albeit with limited understanding, not being a scientist.\n\nThe scientists used a databank from the Simons Foundation that included multiple families with one autistic child.\u00a0 Of course, one limitation is that they did not study multiplex families in which more than one child has autism.\u00a0 This is not an uncommon occurrence as siblings of autistic children are far more likely to have autism than a child in the general population.\u00a0 With fraternal twins it is more likely than in siblings.\u00a0 In identical twins there is an even higher concordance rate, though not 100%.\u00a0 Gadfly wonders if different results would be found for families with more than one autistic offspring.\u00a0 Is it possible they have different genetic mutations or environmental causes for their autism?\n\nEven though my father is a retired engineer and the prevalence of autism among children of engineers and physicists may be higher than in the general population, this makes some sense in my case as there is a history of mental illness, depression, ADHD, learning disabilities and probable autism in my mother's side of the family.\u00a0 It's possible my mother carried some sort of genes that did not affect her because being a female provided some order of protection and they were passed down to me.\u00a0 My non-autistic sister may have been afforded the same protection by virtue of her femaleness. \n\nAnother point of contention is how much of this is 100% genetic or just a predisposition with environmental causes?\u00a0 The fact that fraternal twins are no different genetically than regular siblings, yet have higher concordance rates suggests a environmental factor.\u00a0 Likewise with identical twins who are nearly the same genetically yet don't have a 100% concordance rate.\n\nThis would seem to refute the contentions of the neurodiversity movement that autism is the result of naturally occurring random genetic mutations that have evolutionary benefit and thus have stayed in the population.\u00a0 Of course, I might be going wrong somewhere due to my lack of scientific knowledge and training.\n\nIt would also refute the contentions of the anti-vaxers or others who believe something else in the environment, such as pesticides and ultrasounds have caused a widespread autism epidemic and that genetics plays a limited role if any at all.\u00a0 They say there is no such thing as a genetic epidemic.\u00a0 That the prevalence would not have gone from 1 in 2500 to 1 in 68 just due to some de novo genetic mutations.\u00a0 The explanations of some that I have read is that this study was financed somehow by big pharmacy who wants to cover up the fact that they somehow caused the autism epidemic.\n\nI suppose the neurodiversity movement also has an explanation for what is wrong with this study and why the common genetic variation is correct and the limited number of genes that are vulnerable to de novo mutations that disappear from the gene pool have nothing to do with it.\u00a0 I await their explanation. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150922150236.htm", "http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/09/22/1516376112.full.pdf"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2015/09/does-new-genetic-study-refute-tenets-of.html", "title": "\nDoes new genetic study refute the tenets of neurodiversity? \n"},

{"date": " September 4, 2015", "body": "\nSteve Silberman\u2019s book, Neurotribes,\u00a0 soon to be number eight on the New York Times bestseller list, is now the hottest news story and commodity in the world of autism.\u00a0 He\u2019s been lauded by the New York Times, NPR, and other media outlets for meticulous research on the history of autism and how it relates to what\u2019s going on today.\u00a0 \n\nOne of the underlying themes of Silberman\u2019s book is that autistics were underdiagnosed in the past, until Lorna Wing\u2019s work changed the world view of autism, resulting in higher rates of diagnosis.\n\nSilberman cites Leo Kanner, the person credited for first discovering the syndrome of autism in eleven children he saw over the course of some years during the late 1930\u2019s and early 1940\u2019s, as\u00a0 the culprit.\u00a0 His reasoning is that Kanner, who first gave the condition of the children he assessed a name had a very restrictive criteria for diagnosing autism.\u00a0 His definition was those of lower functioning autistics as opposed to Asperger\u2019s, Frankl\u2019s, and later Wing\u2019s more expanded definition which included people more mildly on the spectrum.\n\nOne of Silberman\u2019s tenets is that many people who should have received an autism label were denied appropriate services and supports that could have helped them cope because of Kanner\u2019s parsimony.\u00a0 This also lead people not to embrace the neurodiversity model of autism in which services and accommodations can solve or at least mitigate problems but instead look for causes and cures.\u00a0 Silberman writes:\u00a0 In real world terms being locked out of a diagnosis often meant being denied access to education, speech and occupational therapy, counseling, medication, and other forms of support For undiagnosed adults, Kanner\u2019s insistence that autism was a disorder of early infancy meant decades of wandering in the wilderness with no explanation for constant struggles in employment, dating, friendships and simply navigating the chaos of daily life.\u00a0 While by building foundations of a society better suited to its need and interests. After stating this, he goes on to subsequent chapters in which he alleges various ham radio operators and very prominent people in the IT field are autistic or have or had autistic traits.\u00a0 \n\nHe makes numerous talking points in his book, interviews and blog posts to support this allegation.\u00a0 He writes about Leo Rosa (Son of neurodiversity proponent and one of the authors of the thinking person\u2019s guide to autism), a boy on the lower end of the spectrum, stating that Kanner\u2019s influence still prevailed by the time this boy, not born until the twenty-first century by the time he was diagnosed. \n\nSilberman posts the following comment on the Marginal Revolution blog: \n\nThe most significant and obvious way in which Kanner\u2019s understanding of autism was monolithic is that every patient described in that paper is a child. Kanner\u2019s model of autism did not include teenagers and adults. That\u2019s not exactly his fault \u2014 he was a child psychiatrist. But the exclusion of teenagers and adults from autism was an omission of Kanner\u2019s that Lorna Wing went on to fix with the invention of Asperger\u2019s syndrome (Wing, \u201cAsperger\u2019s syndrome: A clinical account, 1981) and the broadening of the criteria to include all age groups (as well as the expansion of the lay concept of autism to include adults that followed \u201cRain Man.\u201d) And note: even in that 1943 paper, Kanner makes the surprising assertion, \u201cThere is no fundamental difference between the eight speaking and the three mute children.\u201d That\u2019s overlooking a lot of heterogeneity for the sake of delineating a category. Lorna and Judith Gould originally felt that \u201cKanner\u2019s autism\u201d as a useful concept should be thrown away (\u201cthe findings of the present study bring into question the usefulness of regarding childhood autism as a specific condition\u201d \u2013 Wing and Gould, 1979); but they ended up compromising and creating the image of the spectrum, which echoed Asperger and Georg Frankl\u2019s concept of the autistic \u201ccontinuum\u201d that included children and adults.\n\nIn his book, Silberman states that Kanner would have excluded an individual that his colleague George Frankl (allegedly formerly Asperger\u2019s colleague) had written about for an autism diagnosis because he had the genetic condition tuberous sclerosis.\u00a0 He writes that epilepsy was also a basis on which Kanner excluded diagnoses of autism.\u00a0 Silberman quotes writer Adam Feinstein, author of \u201cThe History of autism\u201d, as stating he\u2019d only seen 157 cases of autism by 1957 and that Bernard Rimland had stated that Kanner told him he\u2019d excluded nine out of ten people that other doctors had referred to him for a possible diagnosis as being autistic.\u00a0 \n\nBefore examining these talking points, here is Kanner's original article He also followed the cases into adulthood nearly thirty years later.\n\nIn actuality, there was a wide range of functioning between the eleven children whom Kanner (and perhaps George Frankl and others) evaluated.\u00a0 Eight out of eleven of them had speech and could carry on semi-normal conversations.\u00a0 Silberman, to bolster his argument, quotes Kanner as saying \u201cThere is no fundamental difference between the eight speaking and the three mute children.\u201d\u00a0 However, he omits the first part of this sentence.\u00a0 As far as the communicative functions of speech are concerned, there is no fundamental difference between the eight speaking children and the three mute children.\u00a0 Silberman then talks about Kanner\u2019s description of some of the eight speaking children and how Kanner emphasizes their speech deficits, but neglects to cite the parts of Kanner\u2019s 1943 paper where he emphasizes some of the instances of speech in the so-called mute children.\u00a0 So, it was only in terms of speech, citing both the idiosyncratic speech of the eight milder children and some instances of speech in the more severely afflicted three cases. \n\nKanner\u2019s first two cases, Donald and Fredrick, would be considered high-functioning even by today\u2019s definition where a high percentage of autistics are still considered to have intellectual disabilities.\u00a0 Alfred, one other case had an IQ tested at 140.\u00a0 Even one of the mute chldren, Virginia, scored 94 on the Merril-Palmer nonverbal IQ test and the testing psychologist stated that this was likely an underestimation of her intelligence.\u00a0 Some of the others would be considered more severe so there was a wide range between Kanner\u2019s cases.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nKanner ends his paper by stating that autism may be more common than it appears as well as emphasizing differences between the kids:\u00a0 The eleven children offer as to be expected offer individual differences in the degree of their disturbances.\u00a0 But even a quick review of the material makes the emergence of a number of essential common characteristics appear inevitable.\u00a0 These characteristics form a syndrome not heretofore reported which seems to be rare enough yet is probably more frequent than is indicated by the paucity of observed cases.\u00a0 \n\nIn spite of Silberman\u2019s allegations, Kanner seemed to have been far more prescient than almost all of his successors to date as far as taking an interest in adult autism.\u00a0 In the first paragraph of his 1943 paper he writes:\u00a0 Since none of the patients has obtained an age greater than eleven years this must be considered a preliminary report to be enlarged upon as they grow older.\u00a0 \n\nKanner indeed kept his promise, publishing a follow-up paper on his eleven charges in 1971 when he was well into his seventies.\u00a0 He first reports on Donald T, who has done relatively well in spite of his autism, obtaining a college degree and working as a bank teller and would certainly not appear to be low functioning as an adult.\u00a0 He reports on Frederick W who worked at the national office of air pollution and was lauded by his supervisor.\u00a0 Another individual, Herbert, though still mute worked on a farm and carried out useful tasks.\u00a0 \n\nThough he states a patient of George Frankl\u2019s who had tuberous sclerosis and epilepsy would not have been diagnosed by Kanner on that basis, Silberman neglects to provide any documentation for this in his copious endnotes.\u00a0 This certainly is not true as Kanner child number ten, John F. did in fact have epilepsy and a focal abnormality in his left occipital lobe on an EEG which Silberman did not mention in his book.\u00a0 Elaine (case 11) also went on to develop epileptic seizures.\u00a0 However, this started in her twenties as reported in Kanner\u2019s follow-up article and it is unclear whether or not her epilepsy was known in the 1940\u2019s when Kanner first wrote about her.\u00a0 \n\nDid Kanner regard autism as necessarily being rare in the 70\u2019s?\u00a0 Based on one comment he made in the follow-up article, the answer would appear to be no:\u00a0 It is well known in medicine that any illness may appear in different degrees of severity, all the way from the so-called forme fruste to the most fulminant manifestation. Does this possibly apply also to early infantile autism? \nKanner wrote this in 1971 at least a few years before Lorna Wing\u2019s and Judith Gould\u2019s attempt to find more people with autism and consider it a spectrum that Silberman alleges. \n\nAutism wasn\u2019t even classified as a category in the IDEA until 1991 which is also correlated with the huge spike in diagnoses.\u00a0 Services for children weren\u2019t widely available until then.\u00a0 One of the few things Silberman gets right is that no one really cares about the problems of autistic adults.\u00a0 This is nothing new in spite of the fact that Kanner, going back to the nineteen forties actually did take an interest in his patients as adults and followed them for nearly three decades.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nIt would seem that blaming Kanner for this is indeed a stretch.\u00a0 This historical perspective on Kanner\u2019s work may serve the purpose of helping Silberman score points for the neurodiversity movement, but really does not seem to me to accomplish anything else.\u00a0 This is aside from the fact that it is plain inaccurate.\n\n\u00a0 It is unlikely that any of the reporters from New York Times or NPR or any other media outlets that have publicized his book have ever read Kanner\u2019s original paper in addition to his follow-up and most likely ever will.\u00a0 No one of any importance will ever realize what Kanner really said and did in spite of Silberman\u2019s spin on this work.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://simonsfoundation.s3.amazonaws.com/share/071207-leo-kanner-autistic-affective-contact.pdf", "http://neurodiversity.com/library_kanner_1971.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2015/09/steve-silbermans-bizarre-take-on.html", "title": "\nSteve Silberman's bizarre take on Kanner's work and influence in the field of autism \n"},

{"date": " January 19, 2015", "body": "\nJust now, I was looking at jonathan's journal, the short lived predecessor to Autism's Gadfly, and I noticed that the date that I moved my blogging activity here was January 18, 2008. \u00a0This means that yesterday was the seventh anniversary of this blog. \u00a0I've never blogged about an anniversary before and I suppose seven years is not a milestone like ten years is, but I was still thinking about all I've been through since I created this blog. \u00a0When web developer Tim Boucher heard my studio 360 show on NPR, he was duly impressed with my interview and offered to build me a website free of charge at the end of 2002. \u00a0It had this journaling section without the ability to post comments that was a less sophisticated version of blogger, but powered by Blogger. \u00a0Twelve years ago, blogging was still something very new and I was not sure what to do with the journal section. \u00a0Eventually, I ended up posting a few things. \u00a0I wrote a rough version of my article, Neurodiversity, Just Say No, which I made into a whole article later. \u00a0Harold Doherty was nice enough to give the article a shout out on his blog. \u00a0This drew the ire of some members of the neurodiversity movement, particularly Michelle Dawson who stated that she wanted to comment on the article, but I had no comments and she alleged that Harold did not allow her to comment on his blog. \u00a0Other people seemed to be concerned that I was something of a chickenshit because I would dare write polemic on the internet without allowing people to refute my notions in a comment section. \u00a0I'd seen other blogs such as the now defunct Autism Diva and Harold Doherty's. \n\nI decided to move my blogging from Jonathan's Journal to a new blogger blog Autism's Gadfly seven years ago yesterday for this reason. \u00a0I knew about personal attacks so I decided to add comment moderation. \u00a0Michelle Dawson then engaged in an angry rant, declaring that because I was opposed to neurodiversity this meant I was opposed to human rights. \u00a0Because I moderated comments, she stated that she would never comment on my blog as apparently I'd delete any comemnts she made that disagreed with mine. \u00a0I turned off the moderation and offered to allow her to comment, but she declined. \u00a0After leaving comment moderation off, I began to get vicious personal attacks from some of the more unsavory members of ND. \u00a0I deleted a long verbose comment by one individual who was rude and who threatened to make my life miserable and irritate me. \u00a0He continued to repost the comment after I deleted it, so I decided not to let Michelle Dawson (and others) dictate my life so I have enabled moderation. \u00a0I still publish most comments, even those that vehemently disagree with me and are sometimes nasty. \u00a0Some people seem to be dedicated to harassing me because they don't like my anti-neurodiversity pro-cure message and a few of them went over the line and I banned them.\n\nI've seen a number of blogs come and go over the last eight or nine years or so. \u00a0Autism Diva, Natural Variation, Whose Planet is it Anyway. \u00a0Now I'm saddened that MJ of the Autism Jabberwocky has decided to retire. \u00a0I've still kept going all these years in spite of all the harassment and personal attacks and even libelous statements that I've had to endure from some of the nastier members of neurodiversity. \u00a0I know they read this and I want to tell them (or anyone else) if they think their bullying is going to shut me up they are sadly mistaken. \n\nI keep saying that I might give up blogging or even greatly curtail my activity or take a hiatus, but I seem to want to keep on going. \u00a0I've wanted to learn more about the science of autism, read more journal articles and become much more erudite than I am already before writing autism nonfiction. \u00a0But I guess I still feel compelled to write stuff on the internet. \u00a0Though I still blog, my input has decreased somewhat over the years and I don't know when I will be compelled to write stuff, but I guess I play it by ear and wing it. \n\nIt's been a rather interesting seven years, not sure what the next seven years holds for me, but I realize the prognosis has never been good for people with autism, even those as mildly affected as I am. \u00a0As I approach the milestone of age sixty, I realize things did not turn out in my life the way I had envisioned and hoped, and it has been a tremendous disappointment to say the least. \u00a0However, I just wanted to give a shoutout of my seven year anniversary. \u00a0Happy anniversary to me. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/journal/index.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2015/01/happy-anniversary-to-gadfly.html", "title": "\nhappy anniversary to Gadfly \n"},
{"date": " July 30, 2014", "body": "\nNeurodiversity remains a controversial movement and people on both sides of the fence have made a variety of statements about it.\u00a0 To some it is about basic human rights and/or civil rights for people on the autism spectrum or who have related neurologic disabilities (or differences for those who prefer that term).\u00a0 Some have said it means an alternative form of brain wiring that is just a natural human variation the way eye color is.\u00a0 To some parents of autistic children it is people stating that they don't really love their children as these parents have not accepted their offspring.\u00a0 To those who oppose it, it's about not finding a cure or treatments that they desire.\u00a0 To others, it is a claim that with the correct accommodations autism would largely cease to be disabling to those who have it\u00a0 (as well as other brain differences). It can also be financially profitable, at least if your name is Ari Ne'eman.\n\nAs recently as 2009, ASAN supporter \"the autistic bitch from hell\" (who has been rumored to be an alter-ego for ASAN board member Meg Evans)  stated in the comments section of this blog post that the board of directors of ASAN, including Ne'eman himself, worked entirely on a pro bono basis and received no compensation whatsoever.  \n\nThis apparently changed just a couple of years later as of 2011.  I've learned that ASAN recently posted their 2012 tax return online.\u00a0 They've also posted their 2011 return as well.\u00a0 I don't know if they've posted any tax returns of previous years anywhere on line, but if I find out they have I will write a new post or put an addendum on this one.\n\nOn reading the two returns, we see that while all of ASAN's board members, with the exception of Ne'eman, continued to be paid no compensation, Ne'eman drew a salary of $40,000 a year for serving as president of ASAN in 2011.\u00a0 In 2012, he raised his own pay to $65,000, a 62% annual salary increase which is as high an annual pay raise I suspect that most Americans would be glad to have, particularly in these recessionary times.\n\nIt could be argued that if Ne'eman's work had brought in a proportional increase of funding and donations then he would deserve this hefty pay increase.\u00a0 On perusal of ASAN's revenues for the years 2011 and 2012 we see there was an increase in ASAN's revenues of about $280,000 (rounded to the most even figures) to about $376,000.\u00a0 A 31% increase which is about half the percentage that Ne'eman raised his own salary.\n\nOver the years, one of ASAN's main goals has been to attack the organization they loathe so much, Autism Speaks.\u00a0 One of their complaints about AS has been the high compensation that some of the executives of the organization receive at the expense of autistic people who are denied the appropriate services or supports.\u00a0 I don't have AS president Liz Field's current salary handy nor the revenue that autism speaks made in the year 2012.\u00a0 It seems far fetched to me that her salary would amount to more than one-sixth of autism speaks total revenue which is the case of Ne'eman's ASAN salary for 2012.\n\nOver the years I've criticized Ne'eman for giving advice on how autistics can find and keep employment when he had never actually worked.\u00a0 Matt Carey of the Left Brain Right Brain blog disputed what I said, claiming that Ne'eman's presidency of ASAN constituted legitimate work.\u00a0 At the time, I believed this statement to be fallacious because of what ABH wrote in the comments section of her post on the whose planet is it anyway blog.\n\nI stand by my statement that Ne'eman has never worked a conventional job where you actually do something in the for profit sector or even a regular job where you have to go in and do some sort of work, even if it is for the government.\u00a0 Of course, I do admire his ingenuity in being able to start a charitable organization and raise his own salary by an amount double the increase in the organization's revenue.\n\nOne can only hope this continues to be the case.\u00a0 If Ne'eman's salary increases continue to outpace ASAN's revenue increases by the same amount, in the next several years ASAN's liabilities will exceed their assets and they will become defunct.\u00a0 Then perhaps we can have sane commentary on autism from people who really want do to something to help people such as myself and have constructive ideas on how to do so.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2009/05/turning-trolls-into-stone.html", "http://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2012_ASAN_Form_990.pdf", "http://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2011_ASAN_Form_990.pdf"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2014/07/neurodiversity-can-be-profitable-ari.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity can be profitable: Ari Ne'eman gives himself a large payraise\n"},

Those affected are our family members and friends, colleagues and neighbors. We all can play a roe in supporting those living on the autism spectrum and their loved ones.\n\nOccasions like the IMFAR provide a special opportunity to share the latest findings in the science of autism, which have the potential to improve the quality of life for those with autism. By uniting researchers from across the globe, events like this pave the way for breakthroughs in detection, intervention, and education that can help those affected better prepare for their bright future.\n\nI thank the scientists and medical professionals advancing our understanding of the autism spectrum.

{"date": " June 12, 2014", "body": "\nAutistics have superior skills that can help them find jobs!\u00a0 Headlines such as these have become\u00a0 frequent fodder in the popular media.\u00a0 Persons on the autism spectrum are said to have superior \"attention to detail\".\u00a0 This makes them superior candidates for jobs such as TSA screeners and software testers.\u00a0 Companies such as SAP, Specialisterne and Aspiritech are training high functioning autistics to be software testers and debuggers.\u00a0 A statistic cited in a lot of these articles is that 85% of autistics are unemployed (I have no notion of where this statistic comes from)If we can only tap all of the superior skills autistics have where they outperform typical people the problem will be solved.\u00a0 These people will find their niche and the lack of social skills or other deficits that people on the spectrum have will be immaterial to their occupational success.\u00a0 \n\nWhere does this nebulous term \"attention to details\" come from?\u00a0 At least one of the sources is the commonly held belief that autistic people outperform non-autistic people on the Embedded Figures Test-a test where a person has to find a hidden triangle in a larger image or a Where's Waldo type of picture.\u00a0 Simon Baron-Cohen has said that this shows that autistic people have \"attention to details\".\u00a0 Laurent Mottron and Michelle Dawson have cited various studies showing that autistics outperform non-autistics on this test.\u00a0 They apparently believe that this superiority will enable autistics to be better educated and help them get jobs and even get along better with their parents.\u00a0 This was the rationale that Autism Speaks gave when awarding them a research grant totaling nearly half a million dollars.\n\nProbably the first study of autistics' performance on the Embedded Figures test was done by Uta Frith and Neil Shah.\u00a0 They found that the autistics outperformed the non-autistics in both speed and accuracy.\u00a0 The reason they gave for the superior performance was something called weak central coherence, meaning that autistics have a poor ability to see the large general picture of things and therefore have difficulty understanding context.\u00a0 But the upside is that they might think about things in the smallest parts and therefore might be more attentive to minute details than a typical person.\u00a0 This could give them a superior ability in math and engineering for instance, even if they had resultant deficits in other areas.\u00a0 In other words, though the autistic may miss the forest for the trees, they are superior at seeing the trees in the forest.\n\nHave Frith and Shah's findings been uniformly replicated by independent investigators or is this superior attention to detail (as measured by the Embedded Figures Test) an urban legend?\u00a0 According to a paper by British cognitive scientist Sarah White, the latter may be true rather than the former.\n\nShe cites the sixteen studies published subsequent to Shah and Frith's work that had group designs in which autistic person's performances were compared to controls on the Embedded figures test. \u00a0\u00a0 Only two of these studies replicated the accuracy difference between autistics and typical controls.\u00a0 Of the remaining fourteen studies, half (seven) showed that autistics were able to find the embedded figures more quickly than controls but were either no more accurate or accuracy rates were not cited in the papers.\u00a0 One of the papers showed differences in accuracy only between low functioning autistics and matched controls but no differences in the higher functioning autistics.\u00a0 One paper showed the autistics were less accurate than matched controls on the test. I'll discuss later what this means in terms of suitability for jobs such as software tester or airport screener.\u00a0 There were a variety of possible reasons for the discrepancy in studies such as differences in the way the test was administered, different groups of controls vs. autistics.\n\nIn White's study, she used a very large sample of\u00a0 high-functioning (as measured by IQs) autistics vs. intellectually matched controls and found no differences in accuracies on the EFT between the two groups.\u00a0 The autistic group performed the task slightly more quickly, but the difference was not statistically significant. \u00a0 \n\nOne salient difference that stands out is that the group differences in accuracy were generally detected with more severely autistic persons rather than persons with milder forms of the condition.\u00a0 This is particularly relevant to Frith and Shah's work in that it was published in the early 1980s when the definition of autism was different from that of today and it is unlikely their findings would have applicability to people more mildly autistic that would not have been diagnosed as such at that time.\n\nMost of the persons who would be candidates for the above-cited jobs based on an \"exceptional attention to detail\" would be considered at the milder end of the spectrum.\u00a0 Assuming Frith and Shah's weak central coherence theory of autism has any validity, it is unlikely that it would be applicable to these people whose central coherence would most likely be closer to that of a typical person's.\u00a0 Therefore, it is less likely, according to the actual science, they would have these alleged assets that would help them in these professions.\n\nAccording to some, the seven out of seventeen studies that showed superior speed on the test would be demonstrative of an autistic superiority.\u00a0 I don't agree, particularly if you are applying the research to enable autistics to perform jobs or stating this research shows they are suited for these occupations.\u00a0 I know from personal experience accuracy does matter.\u00a0 In the days when I was still a medical transcriptionist, my production levels were on par with that of the non-autistic transcriptionists.\u00a0 However, I made more mistakes and this cost me a variety of jobs.\u00a0 This was also true in the other professions I worked in before I retired.\u00a0 In the business world, you could be the fastest employee in the world, but if you're not more accurate, you're kaput.\u00a0 \n\nThough I've read White's article, I have not read the other studies and I will admit to that.\u00a0 If there is something White gets wrong or something else I am not understanding, I guess people can let me know in the comments section.\u00a0 Also, there may be other tests given to autistics that allegedly measure attention to detail that I don't know about.\u00a0 I believe the embedded figures test is the main one though.\n\nI want to sum up to say to anyone reading this article, don't get me wrong.\u00a0 I think it's great that people would want to train persons on the spectrum for various jobs and I hope they succeed in the jobs, regardless of whether they have good attention to detail or not.\u00a0 Whatever will enable a person with autism to succeed, I'm all for it and if they can be a success in a job, all the power to them. \u00a0 I hope that SAP, specialistirne and others can help autistics.\u00a0 Though, I've been very critical of John Robison in the past, I do applaud his efforts to train people on the spectrum in the automotive profession. \u00a0 However, I don't think it's helpful to promote what are likely urban legends based on a lack of demonstrated science or science now made obsolete by a different definition of autism where more high functioning autistic people are identified. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304418404579465561364868556", "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10803-011-1182-4#page-1"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2014/06/autistic-superiority-on-embedded.html", "title": "\nAutistic superiority on embedded figures test and resultant employability: fact or fiction?  \n"},

{"date": " July 13, 2012", "body": "\nI just read an interesting post on a blog called harpocrates speaks in which the author criticizes some individuals from the age of autism blog who question the legitimacy of the autistic stakeholders who are public members of the IACC.\u00a0 This was in response to an individual claiming that autistic people who were dependent on the government for services had no right to refuse a cure should there be one.\u00a0 This position causes outrage among the neurodiverse autistics who state they would refuse a cure if one is ever found.\u00a0 This individual was responding to a comparison of wheelchair bound people asking for access rather than a cure.\u00a0 Left brain right brain blogger and IACC member Matt Carey, who is apparently against curing autism but feels the taxpayers should spend billions of dollars on special education for his offspring as well as other kids,also weighed in \n\nHarpocrates does make a couple of valid points.\u00a0 There is no cure available and that a number of things the age of autism crowd touts as a cure or at least treatment are likely of questionable value if not outright quackery.\n\nMy question is, exactly what accommodations will neurodiversity extremist IACC members Noah Britton and Scott Robertson suggest that is anywhere near analogous to wheelchair access? \n\nOne reader, Liv's parents, suggested spending more taxpayer money on living arrangements so low functioning autistics won't bash their parents heads in.\u00a0 Apparently it's okay for the disabled person to bash a staff member's head on concrete but not their parents' heads.\u00a0 \n\nIn private emailings with Ari Ne'eman, he's suggested vocational training,though has no real proof it would enable the asd person to work in the same manner as wheelchair access would help someone with no or impaired legs get around.\u00a0 He also suggested eliminating social pleasantry as a hiring criteria in the workplace.\u00a0 This is certainly not realistic.\u00a0 ASAN has written on their website that the law requires employers to accommodate persons with autism.\u00a0 They neglect to mention that the law only requires reasonable accommodations (whatever that means).\u00a0 The law specifically states that anything that would provide a financial burden to the employer such as having to pay for a job coach out of their own pocket, a proofreader to check for errors, an aide to help control behavior, etc. is something employers don't legally have to provide.\u00a0 Contrary to what Ne'eman (and by extension likely IACC member Scott Robertson) believe,there is at least one legal precedent that refutes their position.\u00a0 in one court case, Jakubowsky vs. Christ Hospital, the sixth federal circuit court of appeals ruled that accepting an autistic persons' behavior was not a reasonable accommodation and the claimant lost.\u00a0 He attempted to appeal to the supreme court, but they refused to hear the case.\u00a0 So, it would appear there is no way autism could be feasibly accommodated for in the workplace in the same way that giving access to a wheelchair user could.\n\nAs far as I know, Ari Ne'eman during his brief tenure as an IACC public member, never suggested any accommodations.\u00a0 His legacy was of accusing an economist who did a study showing the expense of autism of being a eugenicist.\n\nI realize that Noah Britton and Scott Robertson have been newly appointed to the IACC so in all fairness I should give them time to see if they can suggest any legitimate accommodations for ASDers. that is not an apples versus hurricane comparison to wheelchair users.\u00a0 There is no evidence that suggests to me that this will be the case--that either Britton or Robertson will have anything constructive to offer.\u00a0 Noah Britton apparently just wants to compare people who wish to cure their autistic children to the Ku Klux Klan as I've written earlier and that people who wish to cure autism, just want to selectively eliminate autism from the population.\u00a0 If there are any suggestions a member of the IACC or any other neurodiversity member has for accommodations as an alternative to an nonexistent cure, I'm interested in hearing them and they are welcome to comment in the comments section. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://silencedbyageofautism.blogspot.com/2012/07/you-have-no-voice.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2012/07/13/the-disabled-dont-have-a-moral-right-to-refuse-a-cure-or-treatment/", "http://www.ebglaw.com/files/46039_HEAL_Advisory-Jakubowski.PDF"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/07/what-accommodations-will-autistic.html", "title": "\nWhat accommodations will autistic stakeholders suggest?\n"},
{"date": " June 27, 2012", "body": "\nNearly four years ago, I wrote a post  discussing the problems of disclosure in the workplace for those of us on the spectrum.\u00a0 One reader responded in the comments section that in his country, Canada, employers are required to make accommodations for person's with disabilities if it does not cause undue hardship to the employer.\u00a0 The Americans with Disabilities Act here in the United States provides similar legislation.\n\nSince the reason for disclosure is inevitably accommodations that could enable a person with autism or any other disability do their job, I thought I'd elaborate more on what I'd written way back and discuss whether or not accommodations would be helpful and other issues along those lines. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nAs regular readers of this blog know, I've been fired from multiple jobs in my life and have not worked in more than five and a half years.\u00a0 Some persons I know have suggested that accommodations are the answer to my problem and that under the ADA, employers are obligated to accommodate my disability.\u00a0 How helpful are accommodations for autistics?\u00a0 Is it feasible to apply the ADA to their cases? Has legal recourse among autistics been successful? \n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act requires employers to make reasonable accommodations to employees that enable them to do their job without economic hardship to the employer.\u00a0 Businesses with less than 15 employees are exempt. \n\nI'm curious exactly what are specific examples of accommodations that were actually granted and/or were upheld in courts of law if a disabilities group litigated against an employer or reported them to the EEOC, the body that enforces the ADA.\u00a0 A Google search turned up a variety of examples.\u00a0 Adding ramps for wheelchair bound employees, allowing the blind to use braille or speech generating readers, allowing deaf people to use sign language interpreters.\u00a0 A disabled secretary with severe asthma or problems with legs who could not climb stairs.\u00a0 They would give the duty requiring her to climb stairs in a two story office building to the able bodied person and have her do another duty such as filing.\u00a0 Are ASD's disabilities that could be accommodated or is this an apples versus hurricanes comparison?\n\nSome autistics may be overly sensitive to light or loud noises (I don't fall in this category).\u00a0 These are easily modifiable factors, the person could be moved into another office where there is less sound or the lights dimmed.\n\nHowever, autistics have social problems, e.g. inability to get along with coworkers, loud voices, poor social skills.\u00a0 In some cases (though not all) it might even be as drastic as sexually accosting a coworker.\u00a0 Ari Ne'eman, an individual in his early 20s who has never worked a day in his life, has stated that eliminating social pleasantry as a criteria for hiring or allowing persons to keep their jobs should be a criteria.\u00a0 This is something that would cause an undue hardship to the employer and other employees.\u00a0 Certainly this is not something they are required to do under the ADA.\n\nWhat about making excessive errors or poor hygiene (reasons I've been fired).\u00a0 This is something that cannot be overlooked and would cause undue economic hardships for the employer.\u00a0 Could reasonable accommodations be made.\u00a0 One soloution is to let the autistic person who makes excessive errors go more slowly or review the work.\u00a0 But this would cost the employer money and cause an undue hardship.\u00a0 Other aspects of autism such as lack of executive functioning, inability to follow directions may also impair the autistic.\u00a0 It is unlikely there are any reasonable accommodations for these that would not be an undue burden on the employer.\u00a0 \n\nAre employers required to hire the disabled person who may have the minimal qualifications over a more qualified non-disabled applicant?\u00a0 The answer is legally no.\u00a0 If a job requires someone to type 50 words per minute and the disabled person types 50 words per minute, but they find a non-disabled person who types 75, they can certainly legally hire the nondisabled person if they desire.\u00a0 In the same vein, employers are not required to accommodate a person on the spectrum, who makes excessive errors, does not do the job fast enough or has social problems that could cause an undue burden on the employer or fellow employees.\u00a0 If the job involved them being in public view of people, could the self-stimulatory behaviors be bad for business if it freaked the shoppers out if a grocery bagger for example were to engage in this behavior.\u00a0 This would likely persuade at least some shoppers to go to another supermarket.\u00a0 Would they be required to accommodate this person?\u00a0 I'm not sure of the answer to that.\u00a0 One example I came across is if someone had a disfigured face that could give fellow employees a customer a bad reaction the law does not allow them to discriminate on that basis.\u00a0 However, would the ASD employee be able to take any recourse with the EEOC or another agency if they were fired for that reason?\u00a0 I'll try to answer that in the paragraph below.\n\nHow feasible is enforcement?\u00a0 How could the autistic person prove they were discriminated against?\u00a0 What would stop employers from lying or claiming the person they did not like caused them undue economic hardship even if they hadn't.\u00a0 Employers would break the law and even in a court case, it would be difficult to prove that they had done so.\u00a0 In the above noted example, the employer could come up with some excuse if it were illegal for them not to accommodate someone's public self-stimulation.\u00a0 They would just falsify a productivity study (something that happened to me at one job I was fired from) or find some other excuse to get rid of them.\u00a0 I realize there may be exceptions to this, but they are likely few and far between.\n\nHave autistics who have been refused accommodations they allege are reasonable been successful in court.\u00a0 In one instance I was able to locate, the answer is no.\u00a0 This case is interesting in that the individual involved was a physician diagnosed with Asperger's.\u00a0 This person was denied accommodations he asked the hospital to give him when he was unable to interact with patients properly or relay instructions or interact on the phone with other medical personnel.\u00a0 In spite of obtaining a diagnosis of Asperger's,\u00a0 the doctor was discharged from his hospital residency.\u00a0 He contended that he could do his job if the staff were aware of his disability and treated him with understanding.\u00a0 The hospital instead offered him a pathology residency, a specialty where he'd have no patient interaction.\u00a0 Though this would have been a viable option for him, he declined.\u00a0 The individual lost at all levels of appeal, including the federal court of appeals (the sixth circuit court) which is just one rung below the supreme court.\u00a0 The supreme court declined to hear his case. \n\nIn another instance an individual with Asperger's was denied a laboratory tech job after disclosing his diagnosis to his about-to-be employer.\u00a0 With the help of an EEOC attorney, he secured a settlement of $60,000.\u00a0 I wonder what was accomplished by this.\u00a0 How far is $60,000 going to take him as far as supporting him over his lifetime.\u00a0 Will the fact he has a disability and sued a perspective employer motivate others to hire him?\u00a0 Will he be able to perform his job with another company?\u00a0 Will anyone else hire him, particularly in a troubled economy?\u00a0 Though, ASAN and others who believe accommodations are an answer will claim this a victory, these are interesting points to ponder.\u00a0 These were also extremely high functioning individuals with Asperger's and not autism per se.\u00a0 How would others unable to graduate from medical school or become lab techs fare? \n\nI'm still trying to locate any instance where an accommodation was successfully used for an autistic person or litigation resulted in them securing employment.\u00a0 I'll possibly be updating this post if I find something new. \u00a0 \n\nAre accommodations a viable solution for the employment problems of persons on the spectrum?\u00a0 I believe the answer is no.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links":

{"date": " September 30, 2012", "body": "\nI was interested to read a post  on Harold Doherty's blog about an article in the Michigan Daily written about neurodiversity activist and ASAN member Melanie Yergeau.\n\nThe article in question starts off with the very offensive title Autism as an identity, not a disease.\n\nIt starts off with the usual neurodiverse spiel that all the stuff about autism being a bad thing is wrong.\u00a0 Ms. Yergeau is a college English professor.\u00a0 Also mentioned is the fact Ms. Yergeau is married.\u00a0 Though the article alleges that she was in special education programs during her childhood, for some reason, she wasn't diagnosed with autism until age 22.\u00a0 What her diagnosis was as a child I'm not sure.\n\nIn the article, the autistic English professor alleges that during the time she was in college, she was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital.\u00a0 The article neglects to give even an alleged reason for professor Yergeau's commitment.\u00a0 I'm pretty sure that in most jurisdictions involuntary commitment can only be done without due process for a period of a few days.\u00a0 Legally, it can only be done if there is medical evidence that the individual in question poses a danger to themselves or others.\u00a0 I'm curious to what the reason was for her incarceration.\u00a0 A link is given to a blog post she wrote on this subject.\u00a0 Interestingly, it appears to have been deleted for some reason. \u00a0 Elyse Bruce, author of the Midnight in Chicago blog,  recently wrote a post on the subject of Melanie's psych hold in which she too seems to question the credibility of Yergeau's statements.  Apparently a number of MY's allies seemed to have been alleging the only reason for her hold was autism and not her being a danger to herself or others.  As Ms. Bruce correctly points out, mental health professionals who violate this law and place holds on people for trivial reasons can be subject to losing their licenses or accreditation or opening themselves up to lawsuits.  So, I have to wonder about the validity of anything Ms. Yergeau says.  I guess the reason for her alleged hold will remain a mystery for the time being.\n\nIn addition to stating that autism is not an illness but an alternative way of being, she makes the following statement culled from the article:\n\nTo the members of ASAN, atypical neurological difference ought to be \nembraced and celebrated. Society needs to change, rather than the \nindividuals, the members say. Having autism is a difference, to be sure,\n but it\u2019s not inferior to any other notion of mental development, no \nless valued than the color of one\u2019s skin or one\u2019s sex.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nSo, in other words, Ms. Yergeau thinks it's a good thing that I'm crippled and sick, that I can't work, can't get things done during the day and have to spend a good portion of my time twiddling (self-stimulation).\u00a0 She takes joy in my fine motor and handwriting impairment and my lack of social contacts and celibacy.\u00a0 She takes joy in my suffering as a bedwetter as a child, in my attendance of special ed schools and all of the suffering that's occurred in my life.\n\nHowever, I have it good compared to most of those on the spectrum.\u00a0 Ms. Yergeau goes even further in celebrating and taking joy in the fact that possibly a third or more of all autistics may be almost completely nonverbal.\u00a0 The fact that severely autistic children bite themselves and bang their heads into walls.\u00a0 Not to mention the problems with elopements and accidental deaths that occur from drowning and other causes.\u00a0 \n\nDespite this fact, Yergeau has taken upon herself to speak for all of us:\n\nAutistic people don\u2019t consider autism to be a disease. So why should the rest of the world?\n\nSo, all autistic people don't consider autism to be a disease?\u00a0 Ms. Yergeau, if you happen to read this, why didn't you consult me?\u00a0 As an autistic person, I certainly disagree.\u00a0 I very much consider autism to be a disease. \n\nAbout the only good thing I can say about this article is it does not repeat the oft cited dictum that the definition of neurodiversity is the pursuit of human rights for those on the autistic spectrum and that those of us who wish a cure and oppose neurodiversity are trying to violate the autistic's human rights.\u00a0 I'm thankful the author gives a more honest approach and correctly states that neurodiversity is more about claiming autism is just a different way of being rather than a disease, illness or even disability as Ari Ne'eman once said.\n\n \nHowever, what about my human rights?\u00a0 What about my right to have my own opinion and not having someone with the low credibility that Ms. Yergeau has put words in my mouth.\u00a0 What about my right to obtain a cure if one is available?\u00a0 What about my right to publicly express my opinion and not have these hate mongers harass me or write libelous things about me?\u00a0 What about my right not to have persons, like Yergenau, who are so mildly affected they can get married and be college professors trivialize my disability as well as others even more severely afflicted than I am? \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nMs. Yergeau, you're violating my human rights as well as at least some other persons on the autism spectrum and I don't like it.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autisminnb.blogspot.com/2012/09/michigan-daily-promotes-harmful.html", "http://www.michigandaily.com//arts/melanie-yergeau-autistic-self-advocacy?page=0%2C0", "http://midnightinchicago.wordpress.com/tag/melanie-yergeau/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/09/melanie-yergeau-violates-my-human_30.html", "title": "\nMelanie Yergeau violates my human rights as well as others with autism\n"},

They allegedly stated that this blogger's post had a detrimental effect on their business, which seems far fetched, at least to me.\u00a0 Seems unlikely this suit would go very far, though I admit i'm not a lawyer or legal expert.\u00a0 LB/RB's blogger-in-chief, Matt Carey stated that he was conflicted about the lawsuit, but did not come right out and say how frivolous it was.\u00a0 There was also a dig at the unpopular (from the point of view of ND) blogger that had no relevance to the topic in question.\n\nIn a post written two days ago the blogger in question stated that he had not yet been served with the suit.\u00a0 I wonder what the probability is that someone would write on the internet that they were suing someone before a subpoena was handed down.\u00a0 This, to me, makes it very suspect.\n\nThough Carey stated he was conflicted, some of the regulars of his blog seemed to have a celebratory attitude, including one of ND's most unsavory characters who has spent time harassing me and writing libelous things about your humble blogger on the internet (now deleted into the phantom zone).\n\nI still remember Zach Lassiter's bogus story about autism speaks trying to put his t-shirt company out of business and Alex Plank, writing it up on the front page of wrong planet without doing any fact checking.\u00a0 Plank ironically enough solicited and received donations for his Autism Talk TV project from AS.\n\nI also remember how the neurodiversity movement lied about this blogger claiming that he threatened Ari Ne'eman with death when all he did was write an inflammatory post stating that he wished ari ne'eman could be tried criminally and executed and asked Newsweek to \"Kill Ari Ne'eman\" referring to killing a favorable article they wrote about him.\u00a0 \n\nI have to wonder if this is a real lawsuit or if this isn't just more lies and mischief from the neurodiversity movement who are just making the story up and posting it on the internet to stir trouble. \u00a0 \n\nThe blogger in question stated that he would provide updates, so I guess I'll just have to repeat the old cliche, \"time will tell'.\u00a0\n\nAddendum:\u00a0 The latest news is that the lawsuit appears to be real although the blogger in question has not yet been served.\u00a0 Although he does not believe he's done anything wrong, he's offered to settle the suit in order to avoid\u00a0 the trouble or hassle or costs or all of the above that defending the suit would incur.\u00a0 Gadfly suspects neurodiversity will have a field day with this and will use this to claim proof of his guilt and mislead people who don't understand about settling to the avoid costs of litigation or other problems when fighting a trivial lawsuit. \u00a0 I guess there will be more on this topic and I will add to it when and if appropriate. \u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2012/09/07/autism-center-sues-over-blog-posts-calling-it-a-fraud-and-worse/", "http://autismfraud.blogspot.com/2011/09/autism-intervention-specialists-pure.html", "http://autismfraud.blogspot.com/2012/09/sued-by-jackasses-from-autism.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2012/09/genuine-lawsuit-or-more-neurodiverse.html", "title": "\ngenuine lawsuit or more neurodiverse mischief?\n"},

{"date": " March 5, 2010", "body": "\nI have just finished the new Jodi Picoult novel House Rules which deals with an 18-year-old boy who has Asperger's syndrome and has a social skills tutor who mysteriously dies and then he is charged with her murder. The novel has an interesting twist in that the boy has an obsession with forensic science. It was an interesting novel and I enjoyed it. There are some people who have stereotypes of persons on the spectrum not enjoying fiction. I do not fit this stereotype. I read a fair amount of fiction and as some persons who follow my life know, I have also written some fiction, 23 short stories, a novel and a second novel in progress which I may never finish the first draft of.It seems that Ms. Picoult, as have many others, has run afoul of certain characters in the neurodiversity movement. Sarah of the cat in a dog's world blog has written a blog post on this issue As well as an additional follow-up post She states that more blog posts will be written about Picoult's novel at a later date. Sarah is offended because she feels that Picoult has presented autistic people as having bizarre quirks, the autism-is-broken model as well the fact that the mother provides biomed treatments for her son and that many parents don't provide this. Also the insinuation that an autistic can only have friends if their mother pays for a social skills tutor to hang out with them. She also talks about the boy's father splitting up with the wife and the Maxine Aston syndrome about women who have psychological distress from being married to an Asperger's spouse. Sarah and her friends are also offended by the notion they wrongly believe that is portrayed in the book that autistics want to be normal. \"Sadder but wiser girl\" has jumped on the bandwagon and has put out a boycott list of persons who are engaging in \"neurobigotry\" with Picoult at the top of the list.The \"autistic bitch from hell\" in one of the most bizarre comments of all seems to think that a lot of autistics will end up boycotting Picoult's works. It is amusing that anyone would believe that a #1 New York Times bestselling author would lose sleep at night because a small handful of neurodiversity proponents would boycott the book.I would like to dissect these arguments from these few ND proponents and put them in perspective. Could the old cliche, \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" be operating here? When we discover in the first of the two posts that Sarah has only read the first 71 pages out of a more than 500 page book the answer would appear to be yes.As far as the father suffering from Maxine Aston's syndrome, there is no reference in the book to the father having asperger's but rather being a computer geek who might be more prone to having an asperger's offspring. Of course it would seem that the wife did not leave him due to unhappiness of being married to an Asperger's man, that he left the wife and his two sons because he could not deal with having a son on the spectrum, admittedly another offensive notion to the ND's the claim alleged by some that autism breaks up marriages.Does the mother hate having an autistic child? On page 157, the mother states that she loves Jake for who he is and is happy that she has found the social skills tutor who does not treat his quirks as abnormal but celebrates the way they make him worthwhile and interesting. She also states she does not wish to change the way he is, the theme throughout the book, contrary to what sarah, SBWG and ABFH say. Contrary to what Sarah says, the boy does not wish to become normal or even be cured, saying he is happy the way he is and that he might lose his intelligence or other redeeming features if the asperger's is taken away from him.Both the boy and his mother state in the book that they do not believe that Asperger's is a disability in spite of the fact that some ND proponents have claimed I and others were mistaken when we said that they did not believe that autism is a disability. It would seem in some parts of the book Picoult is actually out neurodiversitizing neurodiverisity.Admittedly there was one scene in the book which I enjoyed which ND proponents won't like as it showed a very pushy,overbearing neurodiversity proponent trying to convince the mother to make the accused murderer a poster boy for the neurodiversity movement in the style of Darius McCollum and other autistics accused of crimes. The mother expresses disdain for this idea and slams the door in the neurodiversitite's face.The boy also uses the line that ND's like to use by saying I am not autistic but I am a person with autism.One thing I did not care for was the celebrity diagnoses that Picoult offered which were questionable such as Stephen Spielberg and Peter Tork. Of course she stated John Robison in her book who is an example of someone actually diagnosed with Asperger's.Sarah admitted to writing these blog posts before actually having read the entire book. From the comments of \"sadder but wiser girl\" and \"the autistic bitch from hell\" I have to wonder if either of these two individuals has actually read the book at all. I strongly suspect that the answer is no.From reading the book, we see for the most part that Picoult does in fact show some sympathy for the neurodiversity movement and their positions (with the exception of the scene in the book with the pushy ND) The boy and his mother seem to have a pro-neurodiversity outlook rather than an anti-neurodiversity outlook if anything. Though I agree with Sarah that the character is stereotyped and is sort of a mixture of a person with all autistic features and not necessarily representative of a true autistic person, one must remember that this is fiction. Rainman and the boy in the curious incident of the dog in the night time were fictitious characters also. They are not supposed to represent the real world, but Picoult's imagination of what the most possibly compelling character with autism could represent to someone in order to hook them into the novel.When I was nearly 3/4 of the way through the book and enjoying it, I decided on impulse to send the author an email and warn her that some members of the ND movement might approach her and tell her how much they dislike what she has done and urge a boycott of her books. I urged her not to listen to these people or take them seriously. I reminded her how stupid ABFH's comment was as if a #1 new york times bestselling author's sales would be affected by a few neurodiversity malcontents. I knew that she is a busy celebrity and was not sure if she would respond.I was pleasantly surprised when she in fact did write me a nice response. She stated correctly that for every member of the ND movement who was opposed to her book there were 10 who worked to raise awareness of autism for research and were happy with the book's different is not lesser than message. That if the ND's actually read her book in its entirety they would see that was her message.Perhaps Sarah, SBWG and ABFH can read a book in its entirety before judging it by its cover.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/House-Rules-Novel-Jodi-Picoult/dp/0743296435/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1267853477&sr=8-1", "http://autisticcats.blogspot.com/2010/03/blogging-house-rules-i.html", "http://autisticcats.blogspot.com/2010/03/blogging-house-rules-ii.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/03/is-neurodiversity-judging-book-by-its.html", "title": "\nIs neurodiversity judging a book by its cover?\n"},
{"date": " May 5, 2010", "body": "\nI see that the website linking a collection of blogs written by hatemongers and/or desperate parents of relatively severe autistic children (Kristina Chew, Susan Senator and \"CASDOK\" belonging to this group) who have been exploited by this movement and engage in denial and reaction formation as to the state of their children, has taken a hiatus indefinitely. Could this mean the beginning of the end of the hub in particular and (wishful thinking) the neurodiversity movement in general? Socrates of the new republic blog has written about this and I will defer to this oversexed yet wise blogger who is far more knowledgeable than myself about the internal politics of the possibly defunct hub of which he was a member in good standing as to the explanations and the specifics. The most celebrated anti-neurodiversity blogger, John Best has given his take on the matter.The neurodiversity movement started from modest beginnings going back to Jim Sinclair's ANI and Judith Singer's diatribes about how Asperger's should not be considered a disability. Thanks in part to the internet and the possible influence of Ari Ne'eman's family and the vulnerability of certain parents they have grown by leaps and bounds over the past 15 years or so. Could it be that they have gotten too big for their britches?As the movement has flourished, they have actually become somewhat mainstream. They conned autism speaks into giving them half a million dollars using Laurent Mottron and Michelle Dawson as their front man/woman. They conned the Obama administration into appointing Ari Ne'eman to the national disability council though when the guys who wear the white hats fought back against the black hats, this appointment was held up. Then they turned around and conned Barack Obama and Kathleen Sebelieus into appointing him to the IACC. This was in spite of the fact that they lobbied against the combating autism act when it was being debated in congress which the IACC grew out of. The IACC has as its goals funding of scientific research with the intent of curing and preventing autism, goals that Ne'eman and the rest of his disciples have adamantly opposed.However, one must remember the fall and decline of the Roman Empire. When neurodiversity grew by leaps and bounds and as more people joined, there was discord. Different persons had different takes. The personality clashes overrode the political agreement. The autism hub in large part by linking to these blogs contributed to the perverse message of the propagandists but with growth, there was lack of harmony. Perhaps that is what contributed to the demise of the hub, I really don't know. Again, I will defer to Socrates or perhaps another insider who might care to blog about it.Of course the sad part is that the blogs are still there and this will make it harder for me to access the information I need to write about these people, but I will have to do my best. The hub was one of the first websites I would log onto after waking up in the morning after my orange juice and shower and a cursory read of the L.A. times. I had become an addict. Hopefully I won't go through withdrawal, but I will miss the hub with a certain nostalgia. Of course my guess it will come back with a different administrator other than Dave Seidel and my quasi neighbor Hollywood jaded. It makes me think of the song by the Who with the lyrics Meet the New Boss, same as the old boss. I suspect it will come back and nothing will change, but only time will tell.More importantly, could these personality conflicts be the tip of an iceberg. To date there has been a relative dearth of coverage of the ND movement in the popular media. This could change on a dime given their success in conning one of the largest private sector autism charitable foundations as well as the federal government. It would be a twist in the knickers of most parents if they had heard of the neurodiversity movement, if they had seen the bullying and the hateful rhetoric of its adherents towards the parents of these children. As the ND movement grows, the hub's demise (whether temporary or permanent) might be chump change in the grand scheme of things. When persons who have given money to autism speaks hear about the things that Laurent, Morton and Michelle have said, they might boycott the walks in unison, depleting the treasury of AS who won't be able to give Geraldine another 600 grand plus in compensation for a given year. They might actually have to terminate Laurent's funding. Morton might get her funding terminated by the federal government and no longer be able to review articles for peer review. Michelle might have to beg Canada post to give her the old job she had back.When people hear about what Ne'eman says, there will be a backlash of people writing their congressman and senators. They might even find out about Stephen Shore's closet anti-cure philosophy. neurodiversity might be forced out of the IACC or perhaps the IACC won't be reauthorized by congress when that comes up.Or ND might sabotage itself. They might not even need to have ignorant and apathetic parents of these kids who want to help their kids fight back against these people. The personality conflicts might do it for them. This all might mean the beginning of the end of ND.Of course I realize that the discontented child cries for toasted snow as the old Arab proverb goes, but a guy can dream, can't he?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://the-newrepublic.blogspot.com/2010/05/autism-hub-hiatus.html", "http://hatingautism.blogspot.com/2010/05/autism-hub-imploding.html?zx=e7ee784e1b55ed28"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/05/autism-hub-rip.html", "title": "\nautism hub: RIP???\n"},
{"date": " February 9, 2010", "body": "\nToday I went in for a research study on eye tracking in the Cal Tech emotions lab. They are doing research in high functioning autism and Asperger's syndrome. This involved looking at some faces and being asked to push a key depending on the gender of the face under various circumstances. I did this while wearing an eye tracking device on my head. It was rather cumbersome and uncomfortable for the duration of the experiment but I managed it. Dr. Dan Kennedy, a protege of Eric Courchesne in whose research group I have participated in, in the past is the investigator in the study. I have also written about my experiences with the Courchesne lab elsewhere Now that he has finished his doctoral work under Courchesne at UCSD, he is now a post-doctoral fellow in the lab of Ralph Adolphs, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at CIT.It started out last month at an autism conference in Long Beach that I went to. Normally the fare at autism conferences is bland if not drab, mostly behaviorists, special educators or people pushing whatever flavor-of-the-month treatment is extant. Not to mention the Jeff Bradstreets and others who push the very questionable mercury-causes-autism hypothesis. However, this conference was somewhat a metaphorical diamond in the rough. They had Manuel Casanova, who has done autopsies of autistic brains and has demonstrated abnormal minicolumns as a possible etiology of autism. Also among the impressive lineup was a somewhat pregnant Lindsay Oberman who gave her take on mirror neurons and mu wave suppressions. It included Mirella Depratto, wife of mirror neuron maestro Marco Iacabonni,-talking about some of her work. Interesting sidenote, but least relevant to this post Donna Williams was also a scheduled speaker, but she got sick and was not able to show up in person. However, she gave a videotape of her presentation and later there was a question and answer session with her using skype, which I did not attend, leaving the conference before this.Last but not least was a new kid on the block (at least to me) a young and up and coming brain researcher whom I had never heard of named Dan Kennedy. I had not been keeping up with a lot of the literature as of late so I missed out on reading the intriguing study about the default network that he did with Eric Courchesne. here is the study for your reading pleasure. To summarize there are a variety of areas at the brain that have a high activity at rest, i.e. when a person is not engaging in any task such as solving a mathematical problem or reading something. These areas consist of areas of the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex, rostral anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus. These are interconnected to each either via axons and are collectively known as the resting network or default network. Though the study is rather technical for me and I did not understand all of it, the gist of it was that an experiment was done with autistics versus normal controls in which they engaged in a task called the stroop test in which a research subject is asked to read words that describe colors but printed in a different color for example green written in blue ink. The subject is asked to name the color the word is written in rather than the word itself, in this case saying blue instead of saying green. It has been shown that the natural tendency is to say the word rather than the color of the word, so this is a more challenging test than it might appear to be superficially. When the nonautistic controls did this, their default networks shut down, that is they showed a low metabolic rate as measured in a fMRI scan showing that blood oxygen no longer went to these areas during somewhat challenging mental activity. In the autistic subjects, the default network still remained active. It was speculated that abnormalities in these processes might be part of the etiology of autism.This is intriguing to me, because I have to wonder if this is why I have had intrusive thoughts and an inability to concentrate on my former medical transcription jobs making abnormal amounts of mistakes. Could it also have something to do with my twiddling (self-stimulatory behavior)? Perhaps in non-autistic people these areas shut down when they are not engaged in a task, and if mine won't turn off, maybe that is why I have difficult doing things and concentrating.Dr. Kennedy also speculated that because of the high metabolic rates of certain brain areas such as the precuneus and the posterior cingulate cortex they might be more susceptible to damage due to genetic factors, infectious factors or possibly an environmental factor. It seemed to me the way Dr. Kennedy worded this in the study that he was implying that there were known factors in the environment that could cause autism. I certainly questioned this and called him on it. He stated that he meant that for example lead poisoning and mercury poisoning could cause some autistic like behaviors in children brain damaged from these things even if the children were not autistic themselves. I questioned this, because as regular readers of gadfly know, I don't really believe that heavy metal poisoning causes autism. Of course it is speculation and Dr. Kennedy conceded this. He also conceded he did not mean to say that these environmental factors could cause autism itself, just some behaviors that resembled autism such as in lead poisoned or mercury poisoned children.Before I did the eyetracking study, I was introduced to the group's director, Dr. Ralph Adolphs. I was intrigued because Dr. Adolphs had studied under Antonio Demasio, a very well known eminent neuroscientist formerly at the University of Iowa and now at the University of Southern California. Many years ago I read a journal article that was published in the late 1970's by Dr. Demasio and his colleague, Ralph Maurer which dealt with comparisons of adult syndromes of the frontal lobes and basal ganglia and parallels and similarities to autism. The frontal lobes deal with organization and executive functioning which are often the bane of autistic people. The basal ganglia deals with motor behaviors, though I don't think it is responsible for my twiddling (self-stimulatory behavior) or fine motor coordination problems. Though it was interesting one problem is that adult lesions are probably different from developmental lesions so not sure how apt the comparisons are.I was then interviewed by Dr. Lynn Paul, a clinical psychologist who works with the group. We took a break for lunch after that during which time Dr. Kennedy and I reminisced over mutual acquaintences of ours who worked in the Courchesne lab such as Matthew Belmonte and Greg Allen.They wanted me to do some more stuff for them, but it was getting late and I was concerned about driving back in heavy traffic, so I guess this is a saga to be continued. It is also possible that I will have a functional MRI scan done by them at some point but still not sure, and I made a little money which is nice considering my financial situation of late has not been the best. Though I have had two structural MRI scans I have not yet had a functional one, where you do a certain type of task while undergoing a scan. Before I stopped going to the Courchesne group in 1998, Greg Allen attempted one on me, but my head was too big to fit in the apparatus along with all of the computer equipment that was in place in the scanner.Well this is the beginning of what may be an interesting story and a new chapter in the saga of my life with autism so far. I may or may not write more about my experiences with the cal tech emotions lab stay tuned.Addendum:  The group is looking for research subjects with high functioning autism or asperger's syndrome.  They pay $20/hour for the type of study I was involved in and I think $50/hour if you undergo an fMRI scan.  They gave me some pamphlets and told them if I knew anyone to let them know they are looking for subjects.  I think it is possible they pay out of state travel expenses to people who are not local to southern california but i am not sure, you can contact them at (626) 395-4486 or send the director, Ralph Adolphs email at radolphs@hss.caltech.edu\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/corc.html", "http://www.pnas.org/content/103/21/8275.long", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Dam%C3%A1sio", "mailto:radolphs@hss.caltech.edu"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/02/im-participating-in-cal-tech-emotions.html", "title": "\nI'm participating in cal tech emotions lab research\n"},

{"date": " November 3, 2009", "body": "\nAccording to an article in yesterday's new york times there is now talk of eliminating Asperger's syndrome as a diagnosis in the 2012 edition of the DSM.  One of the reasons given is that the diagnosis is confounding and means different things to different people. Asperger's syndrome being included under the rubric of autism has been a boon to two different groups of autism aficionados with whom I have been at loggerheads at various times. The first group is the mercury militia, vaccines cause autism group of people who claim that there has been an epidemic of autism.  They cite the increase in prevalence from 1-4/10,000 to the current rate of 1/150 (or even higher) that has been cited by the CDC and others sources.  It is very likely that at least part of the reason for this increase has been the introduction of Asperger's syndrome into the autism lexicon.  The same is true for autism speaks and the numbers that they give to generate fund raising.  Without these numbers they would not be able to give the simplistic quick fix solutions of chelation and other questionable methods of treating autism.  Or the claims that vaccines have caused an alleged autism epidemic.  It is unlikely they would have been able to do this without Asperger's. The second group is an ugly cult called neurodiversity, which claims that autism is not a defect or a disorder but merely a difference.  Autistic people would do just fine with the right supports.  These people claim to speak from personal experience.  Yet it would seem that the vast majority of them have Asperger's rather than an autism spectrum disorder per se.  Can they really speak for me let alone others such as John Belmonte or Dov Shestack who cannot speak and have challenges in life quite different from theirs? University of Michigan professor Catherine Lord has been quoted in the article as saying there is no difference in the diagnostic criteria used to assess Asperger's from high functioning autism.  However, my understanding of the situation is different from hers.  One of the things that really differentiates high functioning autism from Asperger's is the presence or lack of a speech delay of some sort before the age of 36 months; the former would indicate autism, the latter Asperger's.  Though at one time I thought of myself as being possibly Asperger's, now I don't think of myself that way because I did indeed have a speech delay.  Though, by most standards, I would consider myself quite high functioning, my problems are probably more severe than most of those in the ND movement and some others who call themselves Asperger's and by extension \"autistic\".  Nowadays autism is often diagnosed in persons before the age of 3.  Asperger's is often not diagnosed until about age 8.  So it would appear that though there may be some similarities it would seem that this would show that we are talking about two distinct conditions.Unfortunately, the plan is not to say that persons with Asperger's can no longer call themselves autistic but to include all of these people under one rubric, autism.  Not surprisingly, ASAN leader Ari Ne'eman is a proponent of this plan.  The article quotes him as saying he does not want to look at himself as being a superior Asperger's person but someone with autism.  According to the recent Newsweek magazine article that was done featuring Ne'eman, unlike myself, he did not have a speech delay before the age of 3, but was able to say the names of various dinosaurs at age 2.  He was not diagnosed with any sort of an autism spectrum condition until the age of 12.  Prior to age 12 his diagnosis was Attention Deficit disorder.  If Ne'eman had presented with a clinical picture similar to mine before the age of 3, it is very possible that he would have been diagnosed with autism at the time. My proposal to the authors of the DSM is to eliminate both Asperger's and PDD and just have one diagnosis of autism.   One of the mandatory criterias for whether or not one could be diagnosed as autistic would be to have had a speech delay before the age of 3. This would not only mean that Ari Ne'eman could no longer call himself \"autistic\", but the same would probably be able to be said for many if not most of the members of club ND.  How many of these autistics actually had a speech delay at age 3?  If they didn't, can they really speak for myself and say \"most of us don't want to be cured\".  Or in general talk about how autistics feel.  Would they be able to present their views before the IACC from personal experience?  Would the autistic self advocacy network have to change its name?  It is possible that if the DSM were changed in the manner that I wanted it to be changed this could be the death knell for the neurodiversity movement.  Persons interested in autism with a speech delay  would be able to read stuff on the internet about autism in peace.  We would not be bombarded with the constant trivialization of autism.  We would not be insulted because we want a better life for our children or for ourselves.  They would no longer be able to call those of us who don't like our autism and wish to be cured of it \"quislings\".  They would no longer be able to claim that they deserve to be on the board of directors of autism speaks because of the old \"nothing about us without us\" mantra.  After all, it would no longer be about them. I realize all of these scenarios are a pipe dream.  Assuming that the DSM is in fact changed and Asperger's is eliminated as a diagnostic category (it may or may not be) they could still say that they are autistic.  It is irrelevant that they never had a speech delay or the challenges that more severely autistic persons (even myself included) have had.  This is what would probably happen if the DSM were changed, they would just call themselves autistic.  They would even, according to the article itself, still be able to use the term Asperger's in the loose sense.

{"date": " October 9, 2009", "body": "\nI have read with interest Mark Blaxill's recent take on some new genetic findings that have been published on autism. I have also read Alan Griswold's brief take on Blaxill's take. Blaxill has written about the problems with genetic research in autism previously as well. Blaxill points out that there have been failures of science to replicate findings in genetic research in autism.Assuming that Blaxill's arguments are at all valid, this does not really jive with the thinking of Temple Grandin, probably the most prominent of autistic persons. She has said that getting rid of autism genes would hurt society Grandin states:I would think in an ideal world, you don't want to have people who cant talk, but on the other hand, you definitely don't want to get rid of all of the autism genetics becvause if you did that, there'd be no scientists. After all, who do you think made the first stone spear back in the caves? It wasn't the really social people.So, in other words, the fact that I have to suffer from an incurable disorder/disease is necessary to society. Dov Shestack and John Belmonte and other completely nonverbal autistics are making a great noble sacrifice for the betterment of society. There may be some problems with this argument. There so far has not been a unifying finding on autism genetics. Blaxill's piece may point that out. A variety of different chromosomes and genes have been implicated in autism. autosomes as well as x chromosomes. Various types of inheritance, both autosomal dominance in the case of autism caused by tuberous sclerosis as well as multiplex genes, given the fact that the rate of concordance among siblings, while higher than in the general population is lower in identical twins. So we have to wonder if autism genes are responsible for all scientific endeavors as Grandin alleges, then which gene or genes is it? Which chromosome are these genes on? Are they autosomal genes or sex genes? Are the genetic mutations the result of duplications, or deletions of amino acids? I have written about the problems with Grandin's logic elsewherePerhaps Grandin has some sort of omniscience about the genetics of autism that the rest of us don't have. Pray tell us, Dr. Grandin, what is the genetic etiology of autism that you are keeping a secret from us. Furthermore, since you know what genes contribute to scientific endeavor, perhaps, science can find a way to enhance these genes in ordinary people who might not have the natural stuff to be great scientists. Even more scientific discoveries could be made, a cure for cancer, a way to rid ourselves of dependence on foreign oil, and a way to end pollution.I wish Temple would let me in on her little secret.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/autism-and-genetics-what-weve-got-here-is-a-failure-to-replicate-.html", "http://autisticaphorisms.blogspot.com/2009/10/massive-hunt-redux.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/04/latest-autism-gene-studies-findnot-very-much.html", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/article295.html", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/10/autism-genetics-is-temple-grandin.html", "title": "\nAutism genetics: Is Temple Grandin keeping a secret?\n"},
{"date": " September 25, 2009", "body": "\nI see from reading Alan Griswold's blog, Autistic aphorisms, that the good Dr. Mottron has given a response as to why he would accept funding from autism speaks when he is totally opposed to their goal of curation of autism. I would like to write my open letter to Dr. Mottron, now that Alan has written his.Dear Dr. Mottron:You state that there are three alternatives for what you can do with a system you do not like: 1. You can fight it. 2. You can try to come up with something better. 3. You can try to take over the system you do not believe in as per the old saw 'if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.' Unfortunately, you have succeeded to a degree in number three. Why, I still don't understand.Basically You admit that the only way that you can do the research you want that allows you to publish and get your name in the media (which your research group unfailing always tries to do to spin their research and what they claim the implications are in order to obtain more funding) is by working within the system that you yourself do not like.You know that number one is futile. There is no way you can fight a system you do not like. Most people whose lives are directly affected by autism, whether they be parents or other relatives of autistic persons or those who happen to be on the spectrum themselves and don't like having these problems (myself and others included) are sane enough to realize, this is a bad thing. This disorder is not harmless as you claim. I don't know what your interest is in autism. As far as I know you have no personal dog in the fight, i.e. no child with autism and no autism disorder (Yes disorder not difference!) You can't possibly understand the pain I feel at lack of a social life, of nearly flunking out of college and not being able to become a brain researcher who will actually try to do something to end this misery (unlike yourself). You do not know what it is like to be fired from jobs constantly (something I told you about when we met in Los Angeles last year) to have an addiction to twiddling (self-stimulatory behavior) that is as insidious as any drug addiction in terms of dependence if not cost or harm to my body, to have fears and phobias and to not be able to write legibly. You do not know what it is like to be in a special ed school, to be told you are not good enough to go to a school with non handicapped children, to have to spend recess time being tutored in handwriting because your ability is so impaired and there was no other time they could tutor me, Not to be able to draw or put puzzles together. Not to be able to concentrate on things I read and to become the unwanted center of attention because of a loud voice and funny movements. You do not know what it is like to have a parent worry about what will happen to their child when they die, to have to struggle with the decision whether to institutionalize them, to have to worry about them injuring themselves, not knowing if they are sick because they cannot talk, etc. In spite of your erudition and high education obtaining both an M.D. and Ph.D. degrees these issues are an abstraction to you, Dr. Mottron if you happen to read this. So, no, most people with an interest in autism don't have your irrational ideas that this condition is harmless. They want a cure. You are outnumbered by a factor of hundreds if not thousands. So you know, that if you tried to fight it you are like Don Quixote trying to attack windmills.Number two, it is impossible for you to come up with something better in spite of your deluded fantasies because you can't. Your research with just a limited and nonrepresentive samples of autistic children, showing how well they do on a certain test or how well they process information based on blood oxygen level dependence in an fMRI scan will not enable them to have better lives, to learn better, to get along with peers better, have a higher probability of holding down a job and not being fired or especially to obtain a high paying and prestigious job such as you have monsieur. I am glad you mentioned Isabelle Souleries' study because I have read it and even if you can fool the incompetents at autism speaks into giving you funding, based on your and Dr. Souleries' absolutely unfounded and unscientific interpretations of the study, you are not fooling me. Souleries interpretations of the study were based on the premise that children with autism who score 85 or higher on Wechsler IQ tests have superior raven's matrices performances. As you know, this finding has never been replicated by an independent researcher. Claiming that Hayashi's study showing Asperger's persons have superior scores on Raven's when matched for Wechsler scores with neurotypicals is irrelevant, because this is not what Dawson (2007) was about it was about autistics (not asperger's) who scored much worse than NT controls on the Wechsler scoring high on RPM. Also, Sven Boelte has failed to replicate you and Dawson's findings in this study at least in persons with IQ of 85 or higher. Kimberly Boddner in Nancy Minshew's group has also failed to replicate your findings in the higher Wechsler IQ autistics. Though her findings have so far only been presented as an IMFAR poster and have not yet been published in a peer reviewed journal, I think there is a good chance they will be sometime around 2010. So, your claims about Souleries' study which was partially funded by AS being able to be applied to improve the lives of autistics, has no evidence, no proof whatsoever.Also I question the interpretations of Dr. Souleries' that the more rapid response of this group on the RPM's and the increased BOLD levels in the occipital lobes would ever translate into autistics being able to learn faster or more appropriate educational methods being developed for them. This is total speculation on your part as well as Souleries' and you know it. It is possible that the increased BOLD levels were due to a compensatory effect of other areas of the brain being impaired. You are certainly aware of research showing lack of BOLD levels in the pars opercularis and certain parts of the parietal lobes comprising the mirror neuron system. Perhaps the faster responses in the occipital lobes that Dr. Souleries found were only a compensatory mechanism and not something that would enable autistics to learn certain things faster or better if they were presented with the correct educational methodology as you and Dr. Souleries have reported to certain media outlets.I realize you are not worried about my criticism making an impact on AS. I question your assertion that they are a neutral organization in their fund raising decisions. I seem to remember someone writing in the comments section of Harold Doherty's blog that there was bias in the funding decisions, that the people who serve on the decision boards of AS are the one's who fund themselves. Sort of like the fox guarding the henhouse. I remember Michelle Dawson saying she had collaborated with some of these people. I honestly don't know any more about it than this so I won't comment further. I wish I could find out more about how AS makes funding decisions. I am truly baffled as to why they would give you half a million dollars.Assuming Mr. Griswold is telling the truth and you really wrote the words that appear on his blog, I appreciate your tacit admission that you are indeed a hypocrite. That you only accept the money because you have no other alternative and can't raise the capital yourself or find likeminded neurodiversity organizations to fund your research.Now that I have heard your explanation, I hope to someday hear an explanation from AS as to why they would give someone so much money who states that this condition that has caused me so much pain and misery and pain and misery to others is harmless, to a medical doctor who would posthumously diagnose a historical figure like Tesla whom you never met who died well before you were born. I won't hold my breath though to AS ever giving me an explanation. I believe they don't owe me so much an explanation though as they do the many persons who went on their walks and donated money to them, thinking it would actually go to someone who would try to find a way to cure this condition (a formidable goal, yes, but not nonsensical). Not to mention some of them who have extremely low functioning autistic children who can't even speak and engage in self-injurious behavior who would never be deemed suitable research subjects by your group. These people, have probably never read Souleries' study and probably never will and will probably never even hear of you. They just donated money and time to AS as a matter of blind faith.I realize my post won't change your mind, but some of us who are on the spectrum do suffer and would like to be cured and being able to go to medical school, get a ph.d. and get married and not have this disability a lot of our problems are an abstraction to you. Something to think about.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticaphorisms.blogspot.com/2009/09/laurent-mottrons-reply.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/09/disingenous-response-from-laurent.html", "title": "\nA disingenuous response from Laurent Mottron\n"},
{"date": " November 13, 2009", "body": "\nI see that there is a a new article out that discusses one of the problems of growing up autistic, being bullied. Bullying was a real problem for me as a child. I think most children with a developmental disability will attest to the fact that they had to endure incredible bullying. Of course very little is done about bullying and no one wants to include bullying as a diagnostic category in the DSM as they do autism. There are no segregated special ed schools for bullies and no federal mandate that bullies deserve a free and appropriate education away from handicapped children who are bullied.Though I have had my differences with Michelle Dawson in the past, one time she did write something about bullying on her TMOB comment board which I agreed with. I wrote an article on my website giving Dawson's ideas a shout out and giving my own take on the matter.One young angry member of neurodiversity has argued in the past that a cure for autism should not be found because NT children are such bullies and these are the type of persons who should not be emulated.Other than these comments as far as I know, ASAN nor any other member of the ND movement has said anything about bullies or complained about bullying.  This is surprising in light of the fact that ND proponents have consistently claimed that their movement is about human rights of persons with autism and similar disabilities.  I know that they don't consider the right to treatment or the right not to be disabled a human right.  However, one wonders why not being bullied is apparently not considered a human right by neurodiversity in general and ASAN in particular. I see that ASAN spends the bulk of their time protesting autism speaks, claiming that they are only in existence to get rid of autistic persons, to insult them and urging boycotts of autism speaks and organizations such as toys 'r' us or Lindt chocolates who have supported AS in the past.  Yet they apparently have no problem with Laurent Mottron's acceptance of half a million bucks from this organization. Before I read the recent article about bullying, I was sort of curious why they spent so much time on autism speaks and apparently never organized demonstrations against the Judge Rottenberg center and similar organizations.  For anyone not in the know, the Judge Rottenberg Center (formerly Behavior Research Institute) is a place where children are physically hit and electric shocked.  As far as I know ASAN has never organized a demonstration or protest outside of the JRC the way they have at autism speaks walks. Apparently they don't feel that not being physically abused by these people is one of the human rights neurodiversity crusades for. Now, it seems strange that Ari Ne'eman and his cronies have never, as far as I know, said one word against bullying.  They have never done anything or attempted to address the problem of bullying, I wonder why. Perhaps one reason is that a good number of members of the ND movement are bullies themselves.  They have been abusive to me in the past when my only offense was saying I hate my autism and wish there could be a cure or scientific treatment.  They have called me quisling, house autistic, sworn at me and insulted my parents.  It is a good bet that they bully other people and parents also.  I realize the likely explanation for this is that many of them were bullied themselves as children due to having autism or perhaps for other reasons.  They ended up emulating the behaviors of those who victimized them. Perhaps these are the reasons that ASAN and neurodiversity have been silent on the subject of bullying.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/20091113survey_finds_90_of_autistic_kids_bullied/srvc=home&position=1", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/bully.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/11/autistics-bullied-where-are-asan-and.html", "title": "\nautistics bullied: where are ASAN and Neurodiversity?\n"},
{"date": " October 6, 2009", "body": "\nI just read an interesting post by Kevin Leitch, creator of the autism hub and left brain/right brain blogger. Kevin expresses an interest in facilitated communication and wonders if it is genuine. Kevin, if I remember correctly, has a nonverbal daughter and stated, in what is the usual bizarre logic and lack of common sense among neurodiversity proponents, in a radio interview ,that he did not believe autistics needed a cure. However, if a cure were available, he would give it to his daughter if she herself wished for it. In this interview Kev also repeated his belief that autistics who don't want a cure don't need one as well as the hub's old tagline \"we don't want no stinkin' cure\".One wonders how it would be possible for a nonverbal child to communicate the desire for a cure. Perhaps, for this reason, Kevin is interested in using facilitated communication as a possible intervention for his daughter. Kevin expresses skepticism about FC but makes the following interesting statement:The section of the autism community that accepts FC as a valid technique is largely the neurodiversity movement in who\u2019s(sic) ranks I place myself. But is this making me a hypocrite? I place such firm emphasis on science when it comes to vaccines I can do no less in other areas. But on the other hand voices I trust implicitly within the neurodiversity movement speak out in favour of FC. Amanda Baggs, Kathleen Seidel and (I think) Michelle Dawson to name but three.Kevin neglects to provide any links or documentation of where these three stellar individuals have endorsed FC.Perhaps he mentioned Amanda Baggs because Amanda Baggs claims to be a nonverbal autistic in spite of the fact she once spoke very fluently and then started to gradually lose her speech in adolescence and then fully in adulthood, claiming to have suffered from catatonia. There is evidence that Amanda may not be all she claims. Though some people have accused Amanda of being a malingerer in order to receive her SSI checks and section 8 housing, I have yet to see any actual smoking guns. Even if Amanda is all she claims, she certainly does not present the same sort of clinical picture as Dov Shestack or John Belmonte who have never spoken.Also, he may have mentioned Seidel because she and her husband are good friends of Baggs and may be endorsing the fallacious idea that Baggs is a low functioning autistic.He also mentions Michelle Dawson but seems less certain about her. It would seem strange if Michelle Dawson had actually endorsed FC, being that she is such a stickler for scientific rigor and constantly complains about the low standards of science and ethics being applied to persons with autism. So far, the scientific evidence has been weighted against FC with most (if not all studies) refuting its existence. If anything one would think that Dawson would be criticizing FC and the unsupported assertions of its proponents who apply these low standards of science to autistics.Interestingly, one person he does not mention is Ari Ne'eman. Given that Ne'eman is the president of ASAN and one of the things they have lobbied congress for is inclusion of augmentive communication devices as part of autism insurance bills and the autism treatment acceleration act. There can be little doubt that Ne'eman believes in FC.Kevin also wonders if he should believe in FC given people he respects may believe in FC in spite of all the scientific evidence against it. He states that he does not believe vaccines cause autism because of scientific evidence.Here we see a possible neurodiversity double standard. They accept science that supports their position but reject science that does not support their position. In the past Kathleen Seidel and others have stated that part of the reason they don't like the thimerosal or vaccine hypothesis is because it is insulting to them that anyone would consider them or their children \"toxic\". It would seem in part the autism vaccine controversy is more emotional to at least some neurodiversites than scientific.In this vein, one wonders why at least some members of the ND movement, Ne'eman in particular might endorse FC. Perhaps the reason is, they can then say that rejecting a cure for autism or research in genetics and neurophysiology that might enable autistics to lead a better life is fine. Research that would enable autistics to speak is unnecessary, because FC would give them those same capabilities. It would also enable Ne'eman and his ASAN subordinates to make it look like they are actually doing something constructive to help persons on the spectrum, rather than spewing out hatred, lies and propaganda, such as the despicable no myths video. What did the ransom notes campaign, the campaign against the York Pennsylvania kidnapping sign, the pressure placed on AS to remove the I am autism video from their website do for autistic people, who must struggle every day of their lives? Perhaps ASAN realizes this and wants to make it look like they are doing something. Maybe ND's want to make themselves look compassionate and not reveal their true colors as to the vicious hate mongers that most of them really are.Perhaps ND's who endorse FC have an ulterior motive.Addendum:  Michelle Dawson has commented on Kevin Leitch's post that she does not in fact support facilitated communication and Kevin Leitch has acknowledged the error and has stood corrected.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3283", "http://autismpodcast.blogspot.com/2006/10/episode-43-kevin-leitch-parent-and.html", "http://www.abaggs.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/10/why-would-neurodiversity-endorse.html", "title": "\nWhy would neurodiversity endorse facilitated communication\n"},
{"date": " October 4, 2009", "body": "\nI have been told by at least a couple of members of the neurodiversity movement who have links to the autism hub (hub of hate would be a much more apt name), and whom Kathleen Seidel* has deemed as members in good standing, that the reason for my problems is not a neurologic impairment that incapacitates me but rather that I had a mean domineering mother who taught me to hate myself. It was because of her attitudes that I have all of these problems and unhappiness. They have gone even farther than this calling my mother \"a witch\" \"a shrew\" and a \"yapping bitch\" claiming that because I never happen to mention my dad in my posts that he must have been driven off by her.Does any of this sound familiar to anyone? No, probably not. It does to me however, because I actually lived through the Bettelheim era as a toddler and small child in the late 1950s and 1960s. I spent approximately ten years in psychoanalysis and had to hear about how my parents went to paint our new house and neglected me and this is what caused my problems. I had to hear about how they happened to let me see my sister naked (my sister is three years younger and the onset of the autism happened around the time she was born) that I noticed she lacked something I had (I think most readers can guess what this is) and that I believed they had cut hers off and that I had worried my parents would cut mine off.My mother had to hear this shit and it was psychologically damaging to her also. Sometimes she would actually break down and cry during her meetings with my psychoanalyst when she would hear this stuff. The fringe cult of neurodiversity which has done absolutely nothing to benefit persons with autism and related disorders yet has caused immense harm and damage to those on the spectrum and their families has done another thing and that is attempt to bring back this era that I and my parents actually lived through.It seems that the hub has yet two new additions to their merry band of hate mongers that they have added to their hub of bigotry. two august bloggers who call themselves Turner and Kowalski These two allege (in an apparently intentionally incoherent rant) that parents of autistic children who wish a cure for their children and are unhappy about their child's autism are like members of the Ku Klux Klan who are forced to raise black children.This type of drivel is read by young impressionable people who are unhappy with being autistic because it has made their life difficult and admittedly they themselves have faced discrimination in the past from society which has caused them to be embittered. I see that the teenage ingenue \"sadder but wiser girl\" who in the past has compared me to a Jew that helped Nazis kill other Jews in the past has weighed in:Wow. That was quite a rant. I had to read it thrice to understand it, what with all the fucks and the color switching. But it was very accurate. The Autism Speaks people do sometimes remind me of KKK members forced to raise black children. About the Godwin\u2019s Law thing, you didn\u2019t even mention the Holocaust, but this situation strangely is comparable to the Nazis spreading hate speech about Jews.Neurodiversity claims they want to make autistics have a good image, but we seem from posts such as Kowalksi and Turner have written and the impression they have made on a minor child, it would seem neurodiversity and the autism hub only tarnish the image of persons with autism and make us look spiteful and hateful and bigoted.Dave Seidel: If you happen to read this. You are not doing autistics and their families favors by linking blogs that spew out this hateful crap. But it figures, as you really know nothing about autism except having a couple of quirky kids.The ND movement has been getting more press and media attention. They have been getting more power and they even conned autism speaks into donating half a million dollars to their cause.When Andrew Solomon's article about Ari Ne'eman and the rest of the ND movement came out, Lenny Schaeffer was quoted as urging Solomon not to write about these people because of the harm they do. I must respectfully disagree with Mr. Schaeffer. I hope the ND's continue to get even more media publicity. I hope more people will write about them. As they become well known people will read the autism hub and read insane blogs such as Kowalski and Turner's odditorial board and they will get bad publicity and most sane people will realize what a scam the whole ND movement is.*Addendum: I have been informed by Dave Seidel that his wife, Kathleen, has no role in actually running the hub, and the Seidels do not unilaterally decide who can or can't join, but this is done by mutual consensus of hub members. Therefore I have edited the content of the original post putting a * by Kathleen's name in the first entry, striking out a reference to her in two other entries and addressing my comment originally directed to both Kathleen and Dave solely to Dave as an administrator of the hub. Regardless of how members are chosen to be listed by the hub, as at least one of the hub administrators I feel he bears at least some responsibility for the content of blogs that are linked to the hub. Since he refuses to justify his actions to me and won't denounce the Kowalski and Turner post, I believe I can still hold him complicit with the posting of the idea that parents who wish to cure their autistic children are akin to members of the KKK who are forced to raise black children.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://turnerandkowalski.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/the-not-so-great-executive-dysfunction-weekend-pt-1/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/10/yet-another-attempt-by-neurodiversity.html", "title": "\nYet another attempt by neurodiversity to bring back Bettelheim\n"},
{"date": " April 30, 2010", "body": "\nIn yet another spitting in the eye by the Obama administration of persons with autism and/or parents of these persons who long for a cure for this horrible affliction, we see that anti-cure activist Ari Ne'eman has been appointed as one of the public members of the interagency autism coordinating committee. I see that one of my favorite neurodiversity hatemongers Harry Williams (AKA \"Socrates\") Is shouting about this from the figurative rooftops The IACC is the government agency that runs the show involving autism research activities that the federal government finances. Ironically enough, though this agency was created as a byproduct of the 2006 Combating autism act which had as its intent to ultimately find a cure for autism. When John Robison took a job as a member of a scientific advisory board on autism speaks, Mr. Williams immediately called him a traitor and a house aspie. We have to wonder why Mr. Williams, who is apparently a member of a British ASAN affiliate has not reserved the same slurs for his buddy, Mr. Ne'eman.The law states that at least one of the public board members has to be on the autism spectrum. Ne'eman is now not only the second autistic person to be appointed to the public board, but also the second person with autism who has opposed curing this disease. So far the number of pro-cure autistics appointed is zilch. There is a snowball's chance in hell that I will be appointed. The other ASD public member, Stephen Shore, has been a much less polarizing figure than Ne'eman and does not go out of his way to publicize his anti-cure beliefs. It can be noted that Shore, who makes his living as an autism consultant, special education professor, and conference speaker would be unemployed if a cure for autism were found.When the Obama administration tried to appoint Ne'eman to the NDC, our side was successfully able to oppose the appointment as it had to be confirmed by the senate and all it took was at least one senator (Tom Coburn, Oklahoma republican, rumor has it being the most likely holdout assuming there are not others) to hold up and possibly abort Ne'eman's nomination, they went out and appointed Ne'eman to this organization. Apparently HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius can unilaterally appoint whomever the Obama administration wants and is accountable to no one and the nomination can't be held up by the senate. So, neurodiversity lobbied for this appointment when they were not successful in getting Ne'eman into the NDC. However, it would seem that this is even worse than an appointment to the NDC, as it deals with just autism and not other disabilities and also money that was intended to go for finding a cure for autism.What is most interesting about this appointment is that ASAN along with Ne'eman were among the most vigorous opponents of the combating autism act when it was debated in congress about 3-1/2-4 years ago. When their efforts to prevent passing of this law failed, they immediately jumped on the bandwagon and attempted to lobby the IACC with their warped agenda. I have written about this previously. How convenient for Ari Ne'eman to be serving as a member of a committee that was passed by a law that he and his cronies vigorously opposed!I am wondering what next? How soon will Al Qaeda be analyzing classified CIA documents? How soon will members of the Mafia be appointed to the police commissions in the cities in which they live?We have seen that autism speaks is a colossal joke and has become nothing more than a neurodiversity sockpuppet given that they have given half a million dollars to neurodiversity rogue Laurent Mottron who along with his pals Morton Gernsbacher and Michelle Dawson has stated that autism is not harmful. Now the federal government is a joke in that it allows anti-cure autistics, Stephen Shore, John Elder Robison and now last but certainly not least Ari Ne'eman to run the show on autism research. (Robison has not been on the IACC but was appointed for some role in reviewing federal grants for autism research)Barack Obama: I know you will never read this, but you just want me to be lonely, you want me to be unemployed and have poor fine motor coordination and not do anything well and not be able to get anything done and to have uncontrollable self-stimulatory movements. You don't want Dov Shestack, John Belmonte to ever speak a word or live outside of an institution. The actions of your administration as far as autism policy goes are reprehensible, beyond the pale really. You obviously want handicapped people to suffer. You want vicious hatemongers who Ne'eman is good pals with to harass me and ridicule me and to spread hate and libel.Well, I hope someday in spite of the gross incompetence and lack of ethics of both autism speaks and the federal government that somehow someday we can find a cure and prevention for this disease or maybe before a cure is found a way can be found to mitigate it and make life easier for those on the spectrum so they won't have to live with all the hardships and limitations that this condition engenders.I will be writing to my congressman and senators about this gross miscarriage of justice. I realize that this will probably be as effective as writing a letter to Santa Claus. If anything interesting comes out of it (which I doubt) I will write about it in autism's gadfly.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://the-newrepublic.blogspot.com/2010/04/ari-neeman-appointed-to-iacc.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/04/ari-neeman-appointed-to-iacc-wtf.html", "title": "\nAri Ne'eman appointed to IACC, WTF????!!!!!!!\n"},
{"date": " July 15, 2009", "body": "\nReaders of autism gadfly remember yesterday I posted about the neurodiverse economist, Tyler Cowen and linked to a recent essay he wrote in my last post. I could not find his book Creating Your own Economy at Border\u2019s but found it today at Barnes and Noble. With some regrets, I purchased a copy. If anyone who is close to sharing my views of neurodiversity wishes to read this book, I suggest you do so only if you have a pretty strong stomach and have not eaten anything 18 hours prior to reading. From reading the blurbs, Cowen seemed to be implying that he somehow was akin to autistics in his thought processes and he was also a colleague of alleged Aspie Vernon Smith at George Mason University. Other than that, I was not sure how his interest in autism and neurodiversity came about. It turns out he has a blog, http://www.marginalrevolution.com/ , which was read by some persons with Asperger\u2019s and he was advised that based on his writing style, he had an autistic way of thinking and he took this to heart. He emphasized that he believes that autistics have certain cognitive strengths and weakness and he wants to trivialize the problems of persons such as myself by stating that he is somehow akin to us. Even though he is a married Harvard trained Ph.D. in economics. He states the tired cliches of neurodiversity about how horrible it is that anyone would regard autism as a bad defect and how much it hurts the feelings of those with autism to think of themselves this way. He talks about the studies that I mentioned in my previous posts about the autistic strengths and weaknesses. I commented on the problems with his reasoning in my last post and won\u2019t repeat that info here.I was curious as to whether or not he would elaborate on the alleged autism of Economics nobel prize winner Vernon Smith, who as far as I could tell was only self-diagnosed by a Simon Baron Cohen AQ test which he took. Cowen concedes this in the book and so apparently Smith was never diagnosed as having AS by a clinician, though he is often given as an example of an autism success story by ND proponents. I also wondered about mathematician Richard Borcherds who is the other paragon of virtue extolled by club ND to prove autism can be a great gift. Apparently Borcherds, according to the book The Essential Difference, sought an ASD diagnosis from Simon Baron Cohen who would not give him one. Though Cowen mentions him in the shorter essay he is not at all mentioned in the book.Cowen advocates schools teaching non-autistics, the \"cognitive skills of autistics\". One positive thing he cites are studies by researchers such as Deborah Fein who state that a substantial percentage of autistics may \"recover spontaneously\" or lose their diagnosis. This is an argument I have made against the costly and questionable autism treatments.Michelle Dawson on one hand is described as a leading figure in autism research. He reports that growing up she had great difficulties learning how to speak meaningfully and cites her as an example of autistic cognitive strengths. Yet he states: Note that by most standards she would count as \"very autistic\" rather than as \"mildly autistic\" I can\u2019t help wondering what Harold Doherty would think about this statement. If Dawson is very autistic, then who is mildly autistic? Where on the spectrum would Cowen put Conor Doherty or Sam Best or other nonverbal autistics?He describes Amanda Baggs as not being able to talk yet writing more sharply than a ph.d., I can\u2019t believe that Cowen does not know about the controversy surrounding Baggs diagnosis of autism yet he does not mention it in his book.He makes out autistic persons he has encountered to be polite and the stereotypes of them being callous not true. I mean what planet is this guy on? Anyone who has seen the neurodiversity crowd on the internet that he writes about can see how cruel and nasty they are and what a bunch of vicious hatemongers exist within this group. He must know this, but conveniently omits this from his book.One stereotype that I am glad that he debunks is autistics having no sense of humor. I believe I have a very good sense of humor and I enjoy jokes and comedy and such.He writes about Sue Rubin (a person I am rather familiar with having met her and her parents), describing her as a highly intelligent autistic. He does not mention the fact that Sue is unable to speak and only communicates by using a keyboard, that at age 31 she is still going to Whittier college and is unable to work in any capacity. He trivializes her very severe autism by comparing it to the ordered thinking of Buddhists, stating that when Buddhists think the way Sue does, they are somehow enlightened but in Sue\u2019s case, her similar modes of thinking and ordering things are pathological. I was flabbergasted to read that he was baffled as to why Sue Rubin was not given the same respect and put on the same pedestal as the Dalai Lama!!He also states that autistic cognitive strengths can be utilized to help with unemployment and that there will be a demand for autistic employees based on these strengths in jobs such as niche jobs, math jobs and jobs requiring the stereotyped ability of attention to detail that autists have. If that is the case one must wonder about the reported 80% or so unemployment rate among autistics and others with similar disabilities.Cowen also states the tired cliche that because autism is highly heritable and autistic traits have not died out they must have some sort of evolutionary advantage. While he may have considerable expertise in economics, the man shows his woeful ignorance of even the most rudimentary principals of genetics. The reason autism and autistic traits have stayed in the population is due to de novo mutations, not due to evolutionary advantage. (This ignorance is something he shares with fellow non-geneticists Temple Grandin and Simon Baron Cohen).He also claims autistics will help with better political thinking, as certain studies by psychologist Rita Jordan have shown that autistics are less prone to stereotyping and rules of law. Well, my experiences are sure different than those described by Cowen in terms of the abuse and nasty discourse that I have constantly seen among anti-cure neurodiversity proponents over the several years that I have endured their barrage of insults on the internet. I do not believe autistics are more objective than nonautistics in spite of Cowen\u2019s assertion. I do not agree with him that autistics are not prone to stereotyping. Based on my experiences with ND autistics, just the opposite would seem true.Dr. Cowen: If you happen to read this post, I want to tell you that you are basing your observations about autism on stereotypes. On research using heavily skewed subject samples of autistics that are not representative of the population of autistics. The ND\u2019s have disproportionate amounts of females and are a heavily skewed subset of autistics. You trivialize my very serious disability and my forced retirement in my early 50s and my inability to make a living in spite of your unfounded contentions that there are detail oriented jobs and math oriented jobs that autistics will just excel in. Your observations about autism are only that of an ivory tower/armchair expert. You want to trivialize the problems that at least some of us have by claiming to share a thought process similar to ours. You don\u2019t know how lucky you are. Had you been autistic at a severity level that I have, you would not have been able to marry, have your children, become a college professor and publish all of your books. If you think that Michelle Dawson is an example of a \"very autistic\" person, then I must be an unfathomable basket case in your esteemed observation. I wonder who you would consider as having a mild case of autism. Something for you to think about.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Create-Your-Own-Economy-Prosperity/dp/0525951237/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1247712816&sr=8-1", "http://www.marginalrevolution.com/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/07/continued-saga-of-neurodiverse.html", "title": "\nThe Continued Saga of neurodiverse economist Tyler Cowen\n"},
{"date": " June 19, 2009", "body": "\nI have been reading a rather interesting and amusing thread about your humble blogger. I am referred to as an example of an \"autistic suckup\" by some neurodiversity character who calls herself \"sadder but wiser girl\". This gal seems rather unhappy that I want a cure for my autism and that I don't like the neurodiversity movement. She seems to think I am spouting hate and drivel. She quotes from my article neurodiversity, just say no. She is concerned about the fact that I talk about my problems in the work place and in social relationships. She goes on to dispute the fact that I am stereotyping autistics as not being capable of relationships. This is certainly not true. I only said that autistics have impairments in relationships that often make it hard for them to find girlfriends (if they are a male autistic or a lesbian autistic). Certainly part of the diagnostic criteria of the DSM involves impaired ability to form relationships. It would appear if anyone is making stereotypes it is her. She just tries to feebly refute my arguments by showing examples of how allegedly autistic persons have romantic relationships and some NTs are single. She quotes from my article where I state:Sometimes i would make above average errors at work, though there was some discrimination as well, (emphasis added) this does not fit in with neurodiversity's solution of accommodation. She then goes on to state: He blames his being autistic for all of his problems and doesn't consider that the problems may be due to discrimination rather than the fact that he is autistic.So even though I highlighted the part of my article from which she quotes as acknowledging that discrimination I received in the workplace was in fact part (though not all) of the reasons I had job problems, she still goes on to state that I don't realize my problems might have been due to discrimination. This shows that sadder but wiser does not even bother to read very carefully items she quotes from. But no, though people's prejudices were a part of the reason I was forced out of the workplace it was not the entire reason. I did make mistakes on jobs and had other problems. Also, the fact that I could not apply myself in school and learn computer programming or other skilled work (which I did try to learn at one time) were definitely factors that made me less employable. The disability to apply myself have executive functioning were intrinsic disabilities, this was not due to societal discrimination. Had I been able to learn to be a good computer programmer (or even plumber or whatever example you want to fill) I might have still had some problems due to people not liking me due to my loud voice or funny movements, I have no doubt that I would have been able to continue working and found a job where my idiosyncrasies would be overlooked if I had a skill that was in short supply and huge demand. This also contributes to problems in the workplace for autists.She then goes on to quote the part where I talk about self-injurious behaviors and ask what ND's want to do about that. She talks about how her sister had self-injury issues and said the solution was simple for her:I can come up with an easy answer for that one: If society is changed, people won't see the need to dope them up with behavioral meds and do all kinds of psychologically harmful things to them to get them to stop them from banging their heads. My sister used to headbang, but we figured out that the problem was due to us yelling and bickering too much and because of us yelling at her. We have refrained from doing so and the headbanging problem, while it hasn't gone away completely, has lessened. Whenever I catch her trying to headbang, I just turn her face so that she is looking towards me and tell her \"no.\" I then give her a hug to make her feel better and everyday, she is doing better.Hasn't gone away completely? Does that mean she just does it five times a day instead of ten times a day? This lady is certainly vague here. Or assuming the headbanging has mostly gone away, how discomforting it must be for the parents who spent tens of thousands of dollars on ABA and biomed and still have their children headbanging or the ones who were presumably able to eliminate it spent all that money for naught. This lady must not have really gotten any wiser despite her nom de plume, as she could have hung out her shingle, cured or at least mitigated every single low functioning child who engaged in self-injurious behavior, charged less than one-tenth of what ABA and biomed practitioners charged and still become a multimillionaire. One must wonder if she really has this solution, why hasn't the world beaten a path to her door?She is apparent disgusted by the fact that I have criticized neurodiversity for not wanting to help people with autism who are nonverbal:Jonathan Mitchell goes on to say that \"even assuming [facilitated communication] could be used for every nonverbal autistic certainly is not the same as normal speech and would not enable them to function at the same level as a normal speaking person.\" There we go again with the disgusting crap about how only \"a normal speaking person\" deserves to be emulated. This destructive drivel has been the justification for the harm of so many autistic persons. Jonathan Mitchell, if you are reading this and think that a person being \"low-functioning\" is a reason to do all kinds of crap to get them into the \"normal\" circle or \"help\" themSo apparently club ND just wants nonverbal autistics to rot. Wanting an autistic person to be able to communicate is just \"disgusting crap\". I wonder how parents of autistic parents who wish for their nonverbal children to speak would like to be enlightened that giving a nonspeaking person with autism speech is only \"destructive drivel\". If others of the ND persuasion feel this way, then they are lying when they say some of us misrepresent ND by saying they don't want to help persons with autism. This person clearly does not want to help persons with autism speak, how else can this be construed?She then goes on to dispute what I say about autistic having problems with unemployment pointing out that \"some autistics like Stephen Spielberg\" have made a lot of money, yet provides no evidence that Spielberg is in fact autistic. Again, we see the use of celebrities and historical figures as examples of autistic successes because they can't find very many success stories among persons with legitimate autism.She then goes on to talk about how I have taken umbrage to the fact that many in club ND have blamed me and other \"curebies\" for Katie McCarrons murder by virtue of the fact that autism speaks supposedly made a video saying that autistics would be better off dead shortly before Katie was murdered. Somehow the causal relationship there eludes me. I wonder why no tears are shed for Ashley Brock or many of the other autistic children who drowned or were run over by cars or trains, killing them in childhood. ND does not want to do anything about this, they want these people to continue being autistic so this can happen, so complaining about Katie McCarron's murder is certainly hypocritical.She then goes on with these words of wisdom which she was apparently quoting from \"The autism bitch from hell\" About how autistics like me are just parasites on the dole and are just victims of learned helplessness, using our autism as an excuse for everything:They cling to their autism diagnosis like it's a security blanket that protects them from ever having to take responsibility to improve their lives. They reflexively oppose any efforts by autistic activists to raise the issue of employment discrimination because they fear that they will lose their disability payments if other autistic people get jobs. They will grovel at the feet of any bureaucrat who can give them a benefit check, pat them sweetly on their incompetent little heads, and reassure them that they're not to blame for any of their failures because their poor defective brains weren't capable of anything better.I find this statement rather odd in light of the fact while Frank Klein and Amanda Baggs, two of the most prominent proponents of neurodiversity, as far as I can tell never worked a day in their life and collected thousands of dollars in social security and section 8 housing, subsdized by the taxpayers. In spite of multiple firings and tremdendous problems in the workplace, I worked far more than I didn't work from age 24 to 51, paying thousands of dollars in taxes. In fact the last 9 years I worked I was an independent contractor rather than a statutory employee, paying double the social security taxes. Though I have applied for SSDI in my 50s, it is improbable I will get it and it is based on tens of thousands of dollars I have put into social security. What a bunch of nonsense and drivel this young lady is espousing. I wonder why she is not critical of Frank or Amanda for all of the thousands of dollars they have cost the taxpayers. If anyone grovels at the feet of bureaucrats that will give them a disability check it would seem to me to be a number of neurodiversity proponents, who claim that they deserve this money and would turn down a cure, even if it means that there not being cured would have to be subsidized by taxpayers.The thread goes on with responses by various posters to sadder but wisers article comparing me to a nazi who caused the holocaust, with an uncle tom black person and someone violating others civil rights. She goes on to call me an uncle tom autistic.In another post in the thread sadder but wiser gives a plug to Phil Gluyas' Mitchell's gadfly website. This is in spite of the fact she herself expresses disdain for Gluyas obnoxious behavior but does not like him very much herself but justifies her plug with \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend\" cliche. From what I have seen most of Gluyas' fellow neurodiversitites don't even like him very much. He is an embarrassment to their movement by his imbecilic comments, his rudeness and obnoxious behavior. He was even threatened with being banned from Wrong Planet and had to leave the website in order to save face. Most of his fellow NDs I am sure wish he would join the other side and become a curebie. So I must be making an impact if this gal has to stoop to giving Gluyas a plug.Someone else took a cheap shot at me and stated that someone who met me told them that I often smelled bad because i did not shower or brush my teeth or change my clothes and speculated this may have contributed to my job losses and lack of social contacts. Actually, at one time this was partially true. Though I changed clothes and brushed teeth, I did not always shower and used deodorant and had issues with hygiene. This was up until the late 1980s I wrote about it in my article about undiagnosing bill gates and other persons. Being fired from a job where one person said there had been problems with hygiene pretty much cured me of this and I then was able to take better care of my hygiene in spite of executive dysfunction problems. Persons claiming Bill Gates is autistic have used this hygiene argument to try to prove he is on the spectrum. So, the ND's know that this is one thing that handicaps autistic persons. However, I did not get involved in autism society activities and meeting others on the spectrum until 1991. So assuming this person who allegedly knew me really did tell that to this other person, it would just be from having read what I wrote in my article rather than having met me and noticing that I smelled bad. Of course, leave it to club ND to claim they want to treat persons with autism with respect and then resort to these cheap shots.They also claimed that I often insulted persons and did not refute arguments with facts. I never insulted anyone unless they insulted me first. Of course, now I try to take the high road and regret that I did not heed the don't feed the trolls signs and responded to the flame-bait that was thrown at me. I did make one snappy comeback today to Socrates who was bashing me in Gonzo's forum today because I just could not resist. Since Gonzo has comment moderation I am not sure she will publish it. However, this is a rareity and it was in response to Harry Williams (Socrates) insults. This is an individual who often likes to take cheap shots at my disability in finding girlfriend. It shows the character and the hypocrisy of club ND along with the statement that somehow those of us who wish for a cure grovel at the feet of bureaucrats to get a check when Klein and Baggs, their major spokespeople are about the most prolific collectors of welfare and subsidized housing around.Funny that they would call me an uncle tom autistic who wants to maintain the status quo, when I have been very critical of biomed, ABA, and have urged the abolition of the IDEA. Ari Ne'eman and ASAN are lobbying congress for full federal funding of special education, so more kids can be segregated in special ed schools, exploited and treated like crap while their parents and special educators play God with their IEPs. Interesting that Sadder but Wiser calls autism speaks a hate organization, yet does not seem to mind the fact that Michelle Dawson who claims that AS wants a short future for autistic people continues to work in the research group of Laurent Mottron who has received a half million dollar grant from the organization she detests so much. When asked why she continued to work with Mottron and why she did not resign in protest all she could come up with was the stupefying copout that \"science wasn't politics\". I wonder why I am an uncle tom autistic and not Ari and Michelle. That is pretty funny actually.Well Sadder but Wiser: Thanks for giving me a good laugh and for devoting so much of your time to giving your very pathetic critiques of my work and also showing me that this proves I must be making an impact.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autistics.org/forum/index.php?topic=2427.0;wap2", "http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/neurodiv.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/jonathan-mitchell-autistic-suck-up.html", "title": "\nJonathan Mitchell Autistic suck-up\n"},
{"date": " November 13, 2013", "body": "\nIn the occasionally some news is good news department, Gadfly is happy to report that neurodiversity proponent John Elder Robison has tendered his resignation from the scientific advisory board of autism speaks.\u00a0 It was in response to this op-ed piece that autism speaks founder's wife, Suzanne Wright wrote.\u00a0 Even though Ms. Wright made the fallacious statement that three million children had autism and ignored the adults such as myself, she did make some good points about the angst that family members of autistic children go through.\n\nRobison accepted a position on Autism Speaks' scientific advisory board apparently believing in the old saw that it's more effective to piss inside the tent than outside of it.\u00a0 Much to his disappointment, autism speaks did not do a 360 degree turnaround and become a neurodiversity oriented organization or at least an organization that would totally cater to his point of view.\u00a0 \n\nIn response, he wrote a letter of resignation to AS president Liz Fields.\u00a0 He wrote:\n\\\n\nI have tried to help Autism Speaks staffers understand how \ndestructive its messages have been to the psyches of autistic people.

We are people.\n\nRenowned blogger Harold Doherty first wrote of the tendency for extremely high functioning persons on the spectrum to speak for all autistics on planet earth.\u00a0 He referred to this as\u00a0\"the royal we\". What right does Robison have to speak for 100% of us.\u00a0 He doesn't speak for me and I suspect at least some others on the spectrum, so what right does Robison have to use the royal we.\n\nRobison speaks of perceived needs:\u00a0 \n\nUnfortunately, the majority of the research Autism Speaks has funded to date \ndoes not meet those needs, and the community services are too small a percentage \nof total budget to be truly meaningful. \n\nRobison should have realized that autism speaks was primarily designed to be a funder of scientific research to study the biology of autism in the hopes of finding treatments and even possibly the cure that he opposes.\u00a0 It was never their intention to engage in mass funding of community services.\u00a0 In fact, Cure Autism Now, one of the organizations\u00a0that merged with the National Alliance for Autism Research to form autism speaks, had as its bylaws that they would only fund medical research.\u00a0 Robison accepted the position on the scientific advisory committee not something meant to fund community services, even if it was his intention to turn this around.\n\nRobison continues to go on,\u00a0implying that the majority of\u00a0adults oppose autism speaks' goal of curation and also how there are no autistic voices in autism speaks and the organization is only for parents.\u00a0 \n\nYes, autism speaks was formed by parents who make decisions\u00a0on treatments for\u00a0their children.\u00a0 That is a fact of life.\u00a0 I am not\u00a0opposed to having actual persons with autism do some sort of work within autism speaks.\u00a0 I'm gratified they have Kerry Magro in their employ.\n\nI'm not in favor of having someone who dropped out of the tenth grade serve on a science advisory board.\u00a0 I'm not in favor of someone claiming to be on the autism spectrum yet who states that he does not have a disability serving on a board, claiming they are a stakeholder, when in fact they have no true dog in the fight.

{"date": " June 19, 2012", "body": "\nI just read an interesting post  on the left brain/right brain blog about the Mitsubishi corporation funding an ASAN program for autistic college students.\u00a0 The sole purpose of this program appears to be training people to engage in neurodiversity activism.\n\nNow a large corporation is also advocating the idea that I (and others) should live our lives as cripples under the guise of the strawman that these people are promoting some sort of human or civil rights for autistic people.\n\nIt's distressing to me that Mitsubishi could have such a cavalier attitude toward autistic persons.\u00a0 They are not funding a program for medical research to live better lives, to be better educated, to help lift those on SSI or without it out of poverty.\u00a0 They are not funding group homes for autistics or any constructive program.\u00a0 Only the hate mongering of ASAN aficionados who want to claim all research into autism is for the purpose of prenatal abortions, who want to insult parents who want to help their kids and those of us with autism who wish a cure could be found. \n\nThe canary party, a group promoting the idea that vaccines cause autism,has written some talking points protesting this.They allege that self-diagnosis is okay for eligibility in this program.\u00a0 I must admit, I don't have any documentation for this, nor does the canary party memorandum provide any links documenting this\u00a0 However, if true, I don't see how this is helping autistic people if someone not diagnosed by a medical professional or psychologist can take place in this program, which apparently has only the goal of promoting a political agenda and not really giving help to anyone.\n\nMitsubishi is claiming the program will help with employment activities among autistic college students, but as the canary party correctly points out, no mention of employment is spoken about in the guidelines, only training people in neurodiversity activism.\n\nMitsubishi also, according to the canary party, mentions helping people with disabilities.\u00a0 After Ari Ne'eman claimed that he never said that autism was not a disability, Autism's gadfly broke the story about Ari's Ne'eman's essay, Difference Is Not Disease, where he put the words \"disabled\" in quotes and stated that difference is not disability.\u00a0 After this essay was linked to on autism's gadfly, ASAN engaged in a watergate type coverup, first editing their essay to state difference is only disability when not accommodated for and then deleting the essay from the site altogether.\u00a0 Also, Gadfly has provided documentation of Ari Ne'eman stating that Asperger's syndrome (which he has) is hardly something anyone would call a disability. \n\nThe Canary party does make one statement in their post that is not 100% accurate:\n\n\n\u201cWhile the Canary Party fully supports the acceptance of all people with diverse neurological conditions\u2026.it cautions that neurodiversity as promoted by ASAN is an ideology that runs counter to the primary goals of every major autism organization in the country.\u201d\n\nThey either don't know or are forgetting that autism speaks has funded the research of neurodiversity rogue Laurent Mottron.\u00a0 The federal government has funded Morton Gernsbacher's research.\u00a0 The autism society of america endorsed Ari Ne'eman's nomination for the NCD.\u00a0 Alex Plank, who has stated that autism equals good, was a keynote speaker at last year's autism society of america conference.\u00a0 Autism speaks has also funded Alex Plank's Autism Talk TV. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \nI have to wonder why the canary party has contacted Mitsubishi concerning their funding of an ASAN project, but has not protested projects that autism speaks and the autism society of america has either funded or endorsed that run counter to the philosophy that autism is a horrible disability and health problem that needs a cure.\n\nIf anyone who happens to read this who has not already read Matt Carey's endorsement of this program or the canary party's post about this, the addresses of the people you can contact to protest these activities are mentioned in the above-linked sites.\u00a0 I doubt I'll bother writing to them as this is already a done deal and it would not accomplish anything.\n\nI just wish I knew why all these people are opposed to me and others being able to live a decent life free of disability, including autism speaks and ASA who gives money to people who are at the opposite end of their stated beliefs.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2012/06/19/thank-mitsubishi-for-supporting-an-autism-campus-inclusion-leadership-program/",

{"date": " October 5, 2013", "body": "\nI came across this article\u00a0stating that well-known Asperger's author John Elder Robison is going to not only teach a course on neurodiversity but is going to be a scholar in residence at William and Mary College in spite of the fact that he never completed high school.\u00a0 \n\nAside from the obvious inanity of a high school dropout being a college professor, the article lists Robison's definition of neurodiversity:\u00a0 \n\nNeurodiversity is the idea that humanity is by nature neurologically diverse \u2013 \nwe have different ways of thinking that are founded in structural brain \ndifferences \u2013 and that diversity is essential to our success as a species \n\nThis is a different definition than Michelle Dawson gave me which states the neurodiversity is the idea that neurologically divergent people have basic human rights.\u00a0 It also differs from the Wikipedia definition:\n\n\n\nNeurodiversity is \nan approach to learning and disability which suggests that diverse neurological \nconditions appear as a result of normal variations in the \nhuman genome.[citation \nneeded] This term was coined in the late 1990s as a \nchallenge to prevailing views of neurological diversity as inherently \npathological, and it asserts that neurological differences should be recognized \nand respected as a social category on a par with gender, ethnicity, sexual \norientation, or disability status.\n\n\nNeurodiversity is also \nan international online disability rights movement which has been promoted \nprimarily by the autistic self-advocate community (though other disability \nrights groups have joined the neurodiversity movement). This movement frames \nneurodiversity as a natural human variation rather than a disease, and its \nadvocates reject the idea that neurological differences need to be (or can be) \ncured, as they believe them to be authentic forms of human diversity, \nself-expression, and being.\n\nSo, it would appear the gist of ND as we know it is that certain individuals should live their lives as cripples and be handicapped.\u00a0 \n\nSo, essentially what Robison says is that if certain individuals were not disabled(he has stated he no longer has any disability whatsoever) we'd have some sort of failure of the homo sapien species.\u00a0 I'm curious what Robison believes would happen to our species if autism and other neurologic conditions were cured.\u00a0 I'm also curious as to what scientific evidence he can provide that this would be the case.\u00a0 \n\nRobison, who serves in an advisory capacity to autism speaks as well as the federal government, has stated his beliefs on whether or not autism is a disease and whether or not a cure should be found: \n\n\nAll of the science to date says autism is \nfounded in structural differences in the brain. Differences are stable things. \nThey are not diseases in need of a cure. Taking away the difference is \u2013 to me \u2013 \ntantamount to changing to another person. In any case, the idea of such brain \nconfiguration is in the realm of science fiction today.\n\nRobison, who is not disabled (by his own say so) seems to have a flippant attitude toward those of us who are disabled and who would want a cure for our conditions.\u00a0 So, I have to wonder if this course Robison will be teaching will state that kids who pound their heads into walls, can't speak, wander off and die in accidental drownings and are hit by cars are not diseased. \n\nThis Curriculum and Robison's involvement in it is insulting to me as an individual who is disabled and has to live a less satisfying life than someone who is not neurodivergent.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vagazette.com/news/va-vg-autism-advocate-john-robison-will-be-scholarinresidence-at-wm-20131004,0,1533037.story", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome#Genomic_variation_in_humans", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2010/03/autism-speaks-welcomes-to-its-board.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2013/10/john-robison-to-teach-course-on.html", "title": "\nJohn Robison  to teach course on neurodiversity \n"},

{"date": " April 21, 2014", "body": "\nThe  story about two cruel girls who have bullied an autistic teen has been gaining a lot of media traction as of late.\u00a0 These girls compelled him to walk on some ice and when it cracked and he fell into cold water, they had him ride in the trunk of the car.\u00a0 They allegedly compelled him to masturbate and have sex with a family pet.\u00a0 They filmed these events on their cell phones.\u00a0 They've recently been charged criminally and the prosecution is trying to have one of the girls, aged 17, tried as an adult.\n\nThe boy has stated that he still considers these girls his friends and wants to continue to socialize with them.\n\nThe media have made much of the girls' cruelty and the boy's apparent social naivete in spite of being pretty high functioning and having a high IQ.\u00a0 A number of people seem to be absolutely baffled as to why he'd want to continue an association with these mean girls or they ascribe it to social impairments.\n\nI'm reminded of my own experiences as a 14-year-old boy in 1969 when I was first mainstreamed in the 8th grade (put a year behind my chronologic peers).\u00a0 A number of girls would say, \"Jonathan, I love you, will you be my boyfriend?\" or pretend an interest in me just to make fun of me.\u00a0 For a brief time, I was socially naive enough to believe some of these girls, though I eventually knew better.\n\nThe answer to this question seems likely to be the boy is frustrated from loneliness and celibacy.\u00a0 This is a problem that is pervasive to a number of autistic people, but the media fail to write about and the neurodiversity movement would just like to sweep\u00a0 this problem under the rug.\u00a0 '\n\nA few years ago, autism speaks  addressed this issue in a phony baloney PSA, making the bold claim that the insurance mandates that they were lobbying for in various states would make the difference between autistic children having friends and not having friends.\u00a0 I addressed the validity of this in the post I linked to above.\u00a0 \n\nI suspect this boy who attends a mainstream school with non-handicapped adolescents has seen others date and have relationships with the opposite sex and is frustrated by this.\u00a0 He probably has a limited number of friends or maybe no friends at all (of course I'm excluding these girls as friends of his) To me it is very sad that this likely scenario is ignored.\u00a0\n\nI'm wondering why the media has ignored this issue completely.\u00a0 Is it possible, never having been an autistic male, they are unaware of these frustrations?\u00a0 Or maybe they just don't want to address the real problems persons on the spectrum face because the \"feel good\" stories sell more newspapers or get more ratings on TV or whatever.\u00a0 I don't know the answer to this, but I suspect this is the case.\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/03/14/autistic_boy_abused_in_maryland_why_did_he_think_his_bullies_were_his_friends.html"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2014/04/an-answer-to-question-of-why-autistic.html", "title": "\nAn answer to question of why autistic boy would want to socialize with girl bullies \n"},
{"date": " September 7, 2009", "body": "\nWell, it's happened again. Actually it happens every September 7. As Sheriff John (for those who grew up in Southern California and are old enough to remember the children's television show on there locally back in the stone age) would say, I'm another year old today. Yes, it's my birthday (for anyone who gives a shit), I am 54 years old now. I am not a terribly young man, but I think I look young for my age. For anyone interested in what I look like there is a photo of myself on my jonathan's stories website. It is somewhat dated, I was 47 when it was taken, but I don't think I have aged too much since then, though I have gained some weight.Somehow each year you become older you reflect back on your life and sort of feel at this advanced age all bets are off in terms of having a better life or being able to accomplish something in the world or making the world a better place or bettering yourself in some ways.As a child, I went to special education schools from age 6 to age 14 with the exception of one half a semester of a regular education private school that I was expelled from at age 12. It hurt being told I was \"not ready\" to attend a regular school with non-disabled kids. For those who blog about autism on the internet, both parents and persons who are on the spectrum themselves, I am fairly certain that the vast majority never attended a special education school in their life. Unless they have and know what it is like to be told you can't cut it in regular education because of your behavior, rather than the lack of reading ability or academic skills, they can't possibly know what the life experience of the majority of autistic spectrumites is like.My first memory goes back to age 4, about 49 years ago when I attended this summer school where my mom hoped to enroll me in kindergarten (as the local public school's kindergarten was out of the question) and being told I was \"not ready\" to attend this school for kindergarten. Mom found a kindergarten that would take me but the principal threw his back out doing some hard labor of some sort and could not look after me and it was felt my behaviors were too challenging for anyone else to take care of me, so I was expelled from kindergarten and still remember the hurt. At age 6 I started special ed school, when the new school year began.In spite of being in special ed I always had hope. I never dreamed my life would end up like this, being fired from multiple jobs, having to give up the ghost and applying for disability. I thought I would get a good college education, be a lawyer, journalist, or some other type of professional and have a nice house with a picket fence and beautiful wife and maybe kids just like \"normal\" people. All of the old dreams that are such terrible cliches.I finally left special education for good and enrolled in the local public school and was put back a grade (8th grade at age 14) and did okay (not great) academically. Upon reaching a later stage of adolescence I went to pot, both literally and figuratively, and I don't know whether or not marijuana abuse, or adolescence angst making autism worse or both affected me. However, my grades started to deteriorate and I barely graduated from regular public high school. I attended community college and then transferred to four year college which I managed to graduate from but not having done well enough to go to graduate school.I then worked a variety of menial jobs, then learned the field of medical transcription, but was too mediocre at medical transcription to keep working in the field and retired from paid employment at age 51.Contrary to what a number of my detractors in the ND movement or elsewhere seem to believe about me, I have always tried my best, tried to live the best life I possibly could.It took me many years to realize the grim prognosis, how my condition was incurable and the unlikelihood of a cure being found in my lifetime. This was in spite of the fact that in college I wanted to go to graduate school and become a researcher who could find a cure for my brain-damage. I thought that dream would be fulfilled but alas it was another pipe dream.I recently read the John Steinbeck novella \"of Mice and Men\". The title comes from the lines of a poem by Robert Burns, \"the best laid plans of mice and men aft gang aglay\". The two protagonists in the novel (one of whom apparently has a developmental disability which might be similar to autism) dream of being able to stop being petty laborers for others but owning their own farm, but this was not to be. I am also reminded of the Jimi Hendrix song Castles made of sand with the line Castles made of sand melt into the sea eventually. Another metaphor similar to the one of mice and men.This would seem to apply to the parents of autistic children, who believe that ABA, special education, GFCF diets, DAN protocols, chelation, etc. will turn their children into normal children or enable them to function much better and be able to make a living and have a wife (or husband), etc. Supposedly the playwright Bertolt Brecht once said, the man who laughs has not been told the terrible news.It also applies to those who embrace a scam like neurodiversity claiming that autistics are just fine the way they are and with the right supports they can do just as well as anyone else and engage in the no myths propaganda film starring Ari Ne'eman and attempt to extol their own brand of mythology for those who might be willing to embrace the opiate of neurodiversity.Of course, I can't help having some hope; sometimes emotions are stronger than logic. Perhaps my life will begin at 54, I will be able to live another 30 years or maybe even longer and accomplish some things while I am still alive. Sometimes it is hard to be realistic so I know how parents of these children feel.Tomorrow is my hearing for SSDI. I have waited nearly two years for this hearing, having originally filed the appeal in December of '07. I was supposed to have the hearing on May 19, but my lawyer was not notified that a vocational expert would be testifying for the government and he did not have the adequate files to crossexamine her, so it had to be postponed. Hopefully I will have my day in court tomorrow. There is a good chance I will write a blog post about it either way. It would be good if I could prevail and get some money (minus what I will have to give to my attorney), but my chances are not good. I am pissed this had to be postponed, that i have to go through this and the hearing has to be on the day after my birthday, but so it goes. If I lose at this level, there may be appeals including the written appeal, having the case heard in federal district court and after that possibly appealing to the 9th circuit court of appeals. Some of these cases are even heard at the level of the supreme court but that is rare.Ari Ne'eman and his fellow ASAN members pat themselves on the back for having lobbied for Obama's stimulus package that will make these SSDI cases move along faster. Just means that if this stimulus works, someone will have to spend five years fighting the government for their disability instead of ten years or more. Yet ASAN and ND just want people with developmental disabilities to rot and not be cured if a cure for them could be found. Being asked for an explanation Ne'eman was only able to reply with the stupefying copout \"being anti-cure does not mean being anti-progress\" but I guess this is all old news for people who read my blog and other autism-related blogs.Well, just wanted to tell the blogosphere that it's my birthday today if anyone cares. My parents care thankfully, but they are in their 80s and won't live forever. I have a sister, but she lives about a thousand miles away from me and we are not terribly close and I only talk to her a few times a year, so not sure who will care it is my birthday when my parents die, but in any event, happy birthday to me.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jonathans-stories.com/"], "link": "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/09/what-again.html", "title": "\nWhat, again!?\n"}
