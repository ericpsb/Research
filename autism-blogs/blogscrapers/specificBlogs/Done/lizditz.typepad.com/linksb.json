Another #CDCwhistleblower. ( link ) Becky Johnson was prompted to tweet this thanks to Jon Rappoport's article:\u00a0 \r\n \r\n The text reads in part: \r\n Boom: another vaccine whistleblower steps out of the shadows \u00a0\u00a0( link ) \r\n by Jon Rappoport April 7 2016 \r\n MMR vaccine dangerous \r\n Vaccine Empire wobbles on its foundations \r\n \u00a0The new film Vaxxed (trailer) highlights one whistleblower, researcher William Thompson, who publicly admitted he and his CDC colleagues lied, cheated, and committed gross fraud in exonerating the MMR vaccine and pretending it had no connection to autism. \r\n Now we have another: Dr. Peter Fletcher. The Daily Mail has the story (3/29/16): \u201cFormer [British] science chief: \u2018MMR fears coming true\u2019\u201d. \r\n \u00a0Johnson and Rappoport are\u00a0referring to this article by Sue Corrigan in the Daily Mail ( link )\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Johnson and Rappoport have been taken in by the Daily Mail's \u00a0perverse habit of not date-stamping articles and scrubbing comments. A casual reader may not realize that the article is 10\u00a0years old. \u00a0The article was actually published on\u00a0\u00a0published February 4, \u00a02006. Rappoport, however, bills himself as a \"free-lance investigative reporter\". \u00a0One would expect better...but it is Rappoport, after all. If Rappoport\u00a0 had\u00a0 investigated, he would have found Kev Leitch's post from February 9 2006,  Peter Fletcher, Melanie Phillips and the Daily Mail \u2013 A Cracked Facade \r\n \r\n Kev's article reads in part: \r\n \r\n The Daily Mail published another MMR piece earlier this week. As usual it had the predicted results in that it stirred up the usual frenzy of illogic and fallacy. \r\n Why do I say that? \r\n In order to explain we need to fast-forward a couple of days to where Melanie Phillips, Andrew Wakefield\u2019s staunchest media supporter in the UK, published her own follow up to the Mail story. I urge you to go read both pieces now before you read the rest of this. \r\n OK, done? Good. \r\n So lets talk about what was said. Basically, the gist of both articles is now the medical community in the UK _have_ to take the MMR link seriously because Dr Peter Fletcher, ex-Chief Scientific Officer at the Department of Health has said a few things about it. \r\n On the face of it thats pretty impressive \u2013 this isn\u2019t some no-nothing from nowhere \u2013 this is an *ex CSO*. But once you get past the fact of who he _is_ and start to isolate what he\u2019s actually _saying_ then, to borrow a phrase, the facade starts to crack. \r\n First is the fact that this sort of argument \u2013 based on his good standing in the past \u2013 is a sort of reverse Argumentum Ad Hominem in that it is argued that it is equally or of more importance regarding who Dr Gordon _is_ as oppose to what he _says_. This is, of course, a fallacious position from which to start. \r\n So what does he (and the original article) actually say? \r\n [Dr Fletcher]\u2026..said if it is proven that the jab causes autism, _\u201dthe refusal by governments to evaluate the risks properly will make this one of the greatest scandals in medical history\u201d_. \r\n Well, d\u2019uh. How is that news? Its obviously true and equally obvious entirely irrelevant to establishing a case for believing MMR has a role in causing autism. Its a tactical appeal to emotion \u2013 nothing more. \r\n He added that after agreeing to be an expert witness on drug-safety trials for parents\u2019 lawyers, he had received and studied thousands of documents relating to the case which he believed the public had a right to see. He said he has seen a \u201csteady accumulation of evidence\u201d from scientists worldwide that the measles, mumps and rubella jab is causing brain damage in certain children. \r\n This is at the heart of the two articles. Dr Fletcher however simply invokes the spirit of these \u2018thousands of documents\u2019 and doesn\u2019t discuss them or what they contain at all. It may well be that he\u2019s hampered by the legal constraints of the case(s) in question but thats really besides the point. What we need to know is \u2013 what can Dr Fletcher _add_ to the debate? Both the epidemiology and the hard science have refuted the MMR link on more than one occasion. If Dr Fletcher has peer reviewed journal based evidence that contradicts or invalidates the science done so far then he should state it. At the moment he is simply repeating a fallacy of intuition, magical thinking and an argument to the future. None of these lend any scientific credence to making a case that supports the idea that the MMR jab caused or contributed to anyones autism. If there\u2019s evidence lets get it peer reviewed and published in a respected journal \u2013 anything else is simply hearsay. \r\n \r\n But wait, there is more. If Rappoport had investigated  even\u00a0further\u00a0 he would have found Michael Fitzpatrick's Spiked article from January 12, 2007,\u00a0 The anti-MMR gravy train derailed. Revealed: How more than \u00a315million of legal aid funding was spent by lawyers trying and failing to prove that the MMR vaccination causes autism. \r\n \r\n You should read the whole article, but here is the gist: \r\n \r\n Five years ago, supporters of Dr Andrew Wakefield\u2019s claim of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism used to argue that \u2018the evidence was stacking up\u2019 in support of this theory. In fact, the only evidence that was stacking up was evidence against the link: more recently a series of robust epidemiological studies showing no reason to suspect that MMR caused autism has been supplemented by rigorous virological investigations failing to demonstrate any link (1, 2). Meanwhile, another stack of evidence has emerged, revealing how legal aid funding bankrolled the campaign against MMR. \r\n The LSC provides a detailed account of how a further \u00a34.2million was claimed in \u2018fees and expenses\u2019 by more than 60 experts retained by the lawyers in the quest to justify their claim for damages against the vaccine manufacturers by proving a link between MMR and autism. \r\n \r\n But that is not all.  Fletcher took money. \r\n \r\n Dr Peter Fletcher (\u00a340,000) was head of the committee on safety of medicines in the 1970s and emerged from retirement to endorse Dr Wakefield\u2019s critique of MMR safety in 2001. He is regularly quoted by anti-MMR journalists, but refuses to speak to anybody critical of the Wakefield campaign. \r\n Fletcher was paid about $71,000 (in 1992 pounds-to-dollar conversion).That's about $128,000 in 2016 dollars. \r\n Some whistleblower. \r\n Published Previously Here \r\n \r\n Wednesday, September 02, 2009  Index to Michael Fitzpatrick's 2002-2009 autism & MMR articles at Spiked! \r\n Wednesday January 26, 2011  The Daily Mail (UK) continuing sorry contribution to fear, uncertainty, doubt, and vaccine fears \r\n Wednesday April 13, 2012  Another Patsy of The Daily Mail's Sorry Continuing Contribution to Vaccine, Autism Fear \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://twitter.com/BeckyJohnson222/status/718523503314542592", "https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2016/04/07/boom-another-vaccine-whistleblower-steps-out-of-the-shadows/", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-376203/Former-science-chief-MMR-fears-coming-true.html", "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2006/02/09/peter-fletcher-melanie-phillips-and-the-daily-mail-a-cracked-facade/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/2703#.VwkxWxMrKkt"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2016/04/peter-fletcher-is-not-a-new-cdc-whistleblower.html", "title": "Jon Rappoport Fails to Investigate: Peter Fletcher Is Not A New CDC Whistleblower but Paid to Spread Fear of MMR in 1990s."},

Their names are\u00a0Dorothy Spourdalakis and Jolanta Agata Skordzka. On August 30, a CBS reporter, Sharyl Attkisson, \u00a0published a reprehensible story about Alex's murder, appearing to excuse the actions of the accused, and using without question or comment videotapes from a  very suspect source . \r\n Between August 30 and September 3, \u00a0 nine or more bloggers wrote articles condemning Attkisson's reporting 1 . \u00a0On September 1, a group,  The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism 2 , launched a Change.org petition,\u00a0 CBS News: Take down the video Behind the Tragedy: Mother Murders Autistic Son \r\n Ms. Attkisson responded to these criticisms on Twitter, on September 3 2013.

{"date": "Monday, December 02, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t This putative list of 28 papers was originally published (to the best of my ability to ascertain) on Joe Mercola's site as a part of his interview with Andrew Wakefield in April, 2010. \u00a0The list has returned to circulation recently, so it deserves another look. \r\n Of the 28 papers, two (#18 and #22) are repeat citations, bringing the number down to 26. Wakefield's retracted Lancet paper was published on February 28, 1998. Any papers published prior to that date cannot be said to \"support\" or \"replicate\" his work. The list of 26 includes three papers (#5, #16, and #17) published well before the Lancet paper, so the list is down to 23. \r\n Of the remaining 23 papers, #s 2, 3, 4, 18, and 19 have Wakefield as a co-author. So we are down to 18 papers. \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n Of those 18 papers, #9 was published by a journal Wakefield edited; #20 \u00a0included Wakefield's co-authors on the retracted Lancet paper; and #27 is closely associated with Wakefield's Texas clinic, Thoughtful House None represent independent replication or support of Wakefield's research. \u00a0So the list is down to 15 papers. Remember what the retracted Lancet paper claimed,\u00a0 \r\n \" We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine.\" \r\n Of the remaining 15 papers, #s 1, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 24,25, 26, and 28 discussed some aspect of gut disfunction in autistic individuals but did not mention measles virus or measles vaccines. \u00a0These 10 papers do not, therefore, \"replicate\" or \"support\" the retracted Lancet paper or Walkfield's research. \u00a0the list is down to 5 papers. Of those 5 papers, #6 and 11 are by one researcher. \u00a0 \u00a0#14 is a speculative paper in a dodgy journal on the author's belief that autism is an occult tetanus infection. #15 discusses a treatment modality. #23 discusses metabolic variations in autistic adults.\u00a0 Paper #6 does mention autism and measles, but there is  sound reason to believe that what the authors found was laboratory contamination , not measles virus. \r\n In short, the list of 28 doesn't \"support Dr. Wakefield's Research\". \u00a0 \r\n The list as cited \r\n \r\n The Journal of Pediatrics November 1999; 135(5):559-63 \u00a0 gut; no measles \r\n The Journal of Pediatrics 2000; 138(3): 366-372\u00a0   Wakefield a co-author \r\n Journal of Clinical Immunology November 2003; 23(6): 504-517 \u00a0 Wakefield a co-author \r\n Journal of Neuroimmunology 2005\u00a0 Wakefield a co-author \r\n Brain, Behavior and Immunity 1993; 7: 97-103 \u00a0 published prior to February 1998 \r\n Pediatric Neurology 2003; 28(4): 1-3  Singh;\u00a0signficant doubts about laboratory findings;\u00a0 \r\n Neuropsychobiology 2005; 51:77-85 \u00a0 gut; no measles \r\n The Journal of Pediatrics May 2005;146(5):605-10 \u00a0 gut; no measles \r\n Autism Insights 2009; 1: 1-11  Published in journal edited by Wakefield \r\n Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology February 2009; 23(2): 95-98\u00a0 \u00a0 gut; no measles \r\n Annals of Clinical Psychiatry 2009:21(3): 148-161 \u00a0 Singh;\u00a0speculative paper \r\n Journal of Child Neurology June 29, 2009; 000:1-6\u00a0 \u00a0 gut; no measles \r\n Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders March 2009;39(3):405-13\u00a0 gut; no measles \r\n Medical Hypotheses August 1998; 51:133-144.

A single case study (that is, one autistic child), from which the authors launch into the (unsupported) hypothesis that many children with autism have celiac disease, or subclinical \"gluten sensitivity\", and either of these conditions may cause micro-nutrient deficiencies and bowel distress.

This study looked at 172 autistic children, who were classified (in a non-specific way) as having GI problems or not having GI problems. Only 23% had GI problems, mostly constipation and diarrhea. Those with GI problems were no different from subjects without GI problems in demographic characteristics, measures of adaptive functioning, or autism symptom severity. Compared to autistic children without GI problems, those with GI problems showed greater symptom severity on measures of irritability, anxiety, and social withdrawal. Those with GI problems were also less likely to respond to treatment. There is a glaring weakness in this study: one is that there was not a \"typically developing, but with matched GI problems\" wing, to see if the GI problems alone would account for the differences. With respect to \"replicating\" or \"supporting\" Wakefield's research, the study did not look for measles virus, nor did study look for mumps or rubella virus. .

Second, this is a short, letter to the editor type report on the investigation of alpha-1-antitrypsin levels in 8 children with autism vs in children with untreated and treated celiac disease and control children. Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a protease inhibitor (meaning it inhibits the functions of enzymes involved in metabolism).

First, note that this was published 27 years before the publication of the withdrawn Wakefield paper. Prior papers do not \"support\" papers published later. Second, it was published the year that the MMR vaccine was licensed in the US and 17 years before it was licensed in the UK. As the paper predates the wide use of the US. At the time, the DSM-II was in effect, \"autism\" was not a separate diagnostic category, but was characterized as \"Schizophrenia, childhood type\". This paper was an early attempt at finding distinguishing features between childhood autism and adult schizophrenia using a number of challenges and physiological measurements. One minor element in the paper is that \"malabsorption\" may lead to autistic behavior.

Alyssa has just published  Autism Speaks Are Work-Stealing, White-Texting Liars. \r\n \r\n Edited to add: I apologize, I forgot to list the credit. Image source is  Boycott Autism Speaks ' Facebook page,  a January 24 2014 post .. For non-Facebook folk, you can learn more about Boycott Autism Speaks at  http://boycottautismspeaks.com/\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 If you would like to read Kassiane's blog, go to\u00a0 http://timetolisten.blogspot.com/ \r\n \u00a0 \r\n Back in \u00a02011, Kassiane Sibley became aware that Autism $peaks had approriated her work. \u00a0I wrote the  following blog post   on January 17, 2012: \r\n \r\n Suppose you are an adult with a particular disability. \u00a0There are a number of national \u00a0organizations and charities whose mission is \u00a0to support your particular disability, but one is dominant, with an annual budget of over $50 million and a massive grass-roots fundraising campaign, with dozens of walks across the country engaging tens of thousands of volunteers. \u00a0However, you (and many other adults with this disability) have  profound  and\u00a0\u00a0 irreconcilable  ethical and philosophical differences with the organization's mission and goals. \r\n Suppose further that you are an author, and this organization, without your permission, has used a passage from your published works in one of their copyrighted publications. \u00a0When you ask the organization to remove the passage, they ...don't really comply. \r\n Now what can you do? \r\n \r\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tThis is exactly the situation that  Kassiane  finds herself with respect to Autism Speaks. Early in 2011, Autism Speaks published an on-line  \"transition tool kit\" , for autistics moving from school into adulthood. \u00a0The  first page  of the 10-page section on self-advocacy featured a quote from Kassiane's 2004 essay, \"Help Me Help Myself: Teaching and Learning Self-Advocacy\", which was published as a chapter in\u00a0\u00a0 Ask and Tell: Self-Advocacy and Disclosure for People on the Autism Spectrum ,  published by the\u00a0 Autism Asperger Publishing Company \u00a0(AAPC). (T he quoted passage is at the bottom of this post.) \r\n In Februrary 2011 Kassiane discovered the quote. She was  deeply offended : \r\n \r\n You can't yank a quote--even a good quote--and get the details about that person wrong and just use it when you know damn well they dislike you and all you stand for intensely.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n An Autism Speaks spokesperson (unidentified in the comment)  responded : \r\n \r\n Hi Kassiane \u2013 we actually did ask whether we could use the quote: the publisher gave us permission. We really liked your quote, it resonated with us and we thought that it would also particularly resonate with parents of individuals on the spectrum who were approaching adulthood. \r\n We may not see eye to eye all the time, but we do hope that you\u2019ll support our efforts to help people with this kit. Our goal with it is simply to help young individuals on the spectrum and their parents successfully navigate a particularly stressful period of their lives. \r\n \r\n \u00a0Kassiane investigated, and found that: \r\n \r\n My publisher insists no permission was given. Even though the quote was pulled (supposedly) they may have some Words.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n At some point after February 4, 2011, \u00a0the quote disappeared from the page. \u00a0All that white space is where the quote appeared ( as always, click to embiggen ): \r\n \r\n But, well, not quite. On January 14, 2012, \u00a0 A commenter wrote: \r\n \r\n go here:  http://www.autismspeaks.org/docs/family_services_docs/transition/Self-Advocacy.pdf and search for Kassiane (Control F). It turns up twice although the page is blank.  Really  funny stuff! \r\n \r\n Kassiane protested and called for help: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n I responded, and sure enough, when you follow the commenter's instructions above, there it is. \u00a0All Autism Speaks did was to make the type for Kassiane's quote the same color (white) as the background. \u00a0 \r\n Here is an organization with a $50 million dollar budget, and they couldn't be bothered to re-format a 10-page PDF. \u00a0It would probably take all of 15 minutes to do it correctly. \r\n But why does Kassiane care? \u00a0After all, the words are gone, aren't they? \u00a0Well, the words are invisible to  humans,  but not to web-crawlers. \u00a0If you search for the name Kassiane is referred to on the PDF, you find that the third entry is Autism Speaks' PDF: \r\n Even worse, if you search for Kassiane + \"Autism Speaks\" it's the fifth entry: \r\n \r\n In case you need a visual of how Kassiane feels about Autism Speaks: \r\n \r\n What should Autism Speaks do? \r\n \r\n Take down the PDF, edit it so that Kassiane's words and bio are gone, and repost \r\n Apologize to Kassiane for the careless way they managed the event. \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \r\n Backstory for those who don't understand why Kassiane and many other autistic adults revile Autism Speaks,\u00a0 \r\n In 2005,  Autism Speaks  was founded, and quickly grew to a position of dominance, first by its fund-raising prowess (raising  $30 million in its first nine months ) and second by absorbing two other organizations, the  National Alliance for Autism Research  (NAAR) and  Cure Autism Now  (CAN). \u00a0 \r\n Protests against Autism Speaks began early in the organization's life. \u00a0In 2006, it released the infamous documentary \"Autism Every Day\". \u00a0Protest began as soon as the film was released, from  autism parents like Mike Stanton \u00a0and an international petition  \"Autism Speaks: Don't Speak for Us\".\u00a0 \r\n Many autistics spoke in criticism of Autism Speaks' policies and beliefs, for example: Cal Montgomery at Ragged Edge  Autistics Speak  (December 16, \u00a02005)\u00a0Amanda Baggs  Exactly Who Is Unresponsive Here?  (May 16, 2006)\u00a0 Autism Speaks/GRASP \u201carticles of understanding \u201d October 26,\u00a02006; \u00a0Michelle Dawson  Autism Every Day's Harsh Realities  (January 21, 2007) ABFH on \" Autism Speaks' Poisonous Ideas \" (July 31, 2006) \" Autism Speaks Campaign of Hate Speech \" (August 20, 2007) \u00a0\" Autism Speaks Eugenic Agenda \" (October 22, 2007)  \"Ransom Notes and Autism Speaks: Partners in Crime\" \u00a0(December 2007) \" Eradicate Autism Speaks \" (November 13, 2009). \r\n The Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN) \u00a0was founded in November of 2006, and spent its first year building organizational capacity. \u00a0In September, 2009, Autism Speaks released another  offensive \"awareness\" video, I Am Autism  (see  here for a round-up of responses \u00a0and  here for another roundup ) \u00a0This prompted  ASAN\u00a0 \u00a0to: write a letter of  protest to Autism Speaks' sponsors, donors, and supporters ;\u00a0 \u00a0organize a  petition \u00a0drive; and organize \u00a0a series of protests at various Autism Speaks fundraising events, for example:  Ohio \u00a0 Washington DC \u00a0 Boston \u00a0 Portland OR \u00a0and  New York City .\u00a0 \r\n More recently, ASAN  chapters have protested at Autism Speaks fundraising events :\u00a0 \r\n \r\n On Sunday, October 9 [2011], ASAN chapters in Central Ohio and Sacramento protested the Autism Speaks Walk Now for Autism events, with fifteen Autistic individuals and cross-disability allies protesting at the Ohio State campus and five individuals protesting in Sacramento. Protesters at both events emphasized the disparities in Autism Speaks finances. Of just over $10 million given in grants in 2010, Autism Speaks gave barely $50,000 to family services, with the rest of the grants going to research, the bulk of which is research seeking a \"cure\" for autism rather than applied research that seeks to improve problems facing Autistic people now. Other criticisms cited last year's over $2.5 million spent in salaries for its top-level officers and directors alone (and over $13 million in salaries total), and Autism Speaks's consistent failure to ensure meaningful representation of Autistic people in their leadership either locally or nationally.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Kassiane's \"whited out\" quote and bio in the Autism Speaks PDF: \r\n \r\n \"One thing autistics and parents of autistics agree upon is the desire for independence. Many skills are taught in an effort to achieve this goal, but one of the most important is consistently neglected. This skill is called self-advocacy. \r\n Self-advocacy is the process by which we get our wants and needs met. If we are to be independent, we have to advocate for ourselves. In spite of this blatant truth, few parents and professionals think to teach advocacy. They do not teach advocacy mainly out of ignorance \u2013 it does not occur to them that a person on the spectrum needs to be shown how. But the truth of the matter is that we do not naturally learn how to get our needs met the way typical children do. There are several reasons why autistic people tend to have poor self-advocacy skills. First, we do not learn social patterns well, and self-advocacy is a social process. While most neurotypical population learns to ask for things by imitation, autistics need explicit instructions. Well-meaning adults often contribute to the problem in childhood by doing for us what we should be taught to do for ourselves, resulting in learned dependence because we do not practice the techniques of advocacy ourselves. The autistic theory-of-mind difference also contributes to our lack of self-advocacy skills. \u201cI know what I need; therefore, so does everyone else.\u201d \" \r\n - Help Me Help Myself: Teaching and Learning Self-Advocacy, by Kassiane Sibley from  Ask and Tell: Self-Advocacy and Disclosure for People on the Autism Spectrum , edited by Stephen M. Shore. \r\n *Kassiane Alexandra Sibley is an independent young adult and like many Aspies her age, she was improperly diagnosed before discovering autism spectrum at the age of 18.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n The bio appears to be a careless editing of her 2004 bio on Amazon for  Ask and Tell: \r\n \u00a0   \r\n In the comments, the following dialog appeared on Wednesday January 18 2012 \r\n lhrandall wrote, \r\n \r\n Autism Speaks' reply to my tweet on this, in which I said it shouldn't have taken a big internet hullaballoo to get them to take Kassiane's quote out of their materials: \r\n \"internet hullaballoo? We thought we'd fixed it last year, but hadn't. Simple human error.\" \r\n Hmm. \r\n \r\n Kai from Autism Speaks wrote : \r\n \r\n We actually thought we had removed Kassiane's quote a year ago, but unfortunately instead of deleting the text, the person who tried to remove it simply deleted the background on which the white copy sat. End result was that although the text was invisible, it was still technically there, and as you point out, was available to be indexed by search engines. \r\n Nothing more than a simple case of human error. It was rectified as quickly as humanly possible over the holiday weekend, and I have both personally apologized to Kassiane, and reiterated the offer I made to her last year to connect so that I might better understand her feelings towards us \r\n Also, point of clarification: we actually did obtain permission to use her copy from Kassiane's publisher, AAPC. \r\n Thanks, \r\n Kai  Autism Speaks \r\n \r\n Kassiane replied \r\n \r\n No one at AAPC wants to admit that they gave you permission. They wouldn't last year either. Even if they did, how do you fail to see the irony in yoinking an exerpt about self determination, as written by an autistic author, without consulting said autistic author? How do you justify this to yourself? Going over my head to an NT is not acceptable, Mr MacMahon. \r\n Furthermore, y'all haven't exactly impressed me with your technological skills or your honesty. Whitetexting is \"harder\" than deleting. And sneakier. You're not going to convince me that it wasn't intentional like this. Did you think I wouldn't find out? \r\n Furthermore, nothing was offered last year except passive-aggressive \"we wish you'd reconsider, oh insightful one\". No offer of a meeting was made. Even if one was, a) I am poor, like most autistics and 2) frankly, you've done nothing to engender my trust. \r\n This non-pology thing, as I said via email (repeatedly now) isn't even a start to making amends. You have associated my words with yourself online for a year, and gods only know how many of the original hardcopy you have sent out. \r\n \"I'm sorry but\" isn't going to fix it. How are you going to fix it? You have violated me, lied to me, and completely disregarded my wishes, then defended it! A PUBLIC apology in which you make clear you understand your eff up would be a start. It wouldn't be remotely close to a finish. \r\n This kind of behavior is why most autistics, and this autistic in particular, absolutely loathe your organization. \r\n \r\n Kai from Autism Speaks replied \r\n \r\n We did get permission from your publisher. I sent you the name person that granted us it last year. More than happy to send it over again if you want. \r\n I'm sorry that you don't believe my explanation. There's not a whole lot I can do about that, I don't think, other than to say that there would be zero benefit to us in us telling you we were going to remove your copy, then intentionally failing to do so. There is no upside for us there. It was an honest mistake, simple as that. \r\n As for it being harder to whitetext... the text was actually white in the first place. What happened was that in the rush to remove you, the background that had sat behind the text was deleted, leaving just the white text on the white background. It was an honest mistake. \r\n My offer to open up a dialog with you, in whatever form you're most comfortable with (in person, on the phone, via skype, email) was absolutely genuine, and still stands. \r\n Kai. \r\n \r\n Kassiane replied \r\n \r\n \"That Person\" is certainly evading me. I do not understand what part of \"it's offensive to use something an autistic person wrote *about self determination* without asking them\" is so difficult for you to understand. Stop hiding behind AAPC & tell me what made you think that was REMOTELY appropriate. \r\n You DO know an \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" apology is the opposite of fixing it, right? Y'all owe me a whole lot of butt-kissing right now, given that unlike you, I am not suing for $90,000. Or are you going to deny sending 30 lawyers after a teenager? (file under: reasons you may NEVER use my words). \r\n Why can't you publicly admit you screwed up & demonstrate that you know why your actions a year ago, over the last year, and now are unacceptable? I've yet to see anyone from autspks admit they mess up. Ever. That's not acceptable. \r\n Y'all kind of blew the 'dialogue' opportunity back when you started & wouldn't talk to or email with a single solitary autistic person. I want you to make amends for using my words without my permission (starting with an unqualified apology & indication of understanding of how you messed up, the rest you'll have to figure out). If you can't even figure out how to do that, why should I \"dialogue\" with you? \r\n \r\n Autism Speaks (presumably Kai) replied \r\n \r\n We are publicly admitting that we screwed up. No argument there: we certainly did that. We're also apologizing: I immediately apologized to you via email over the weekend, and I do so again here. \r\n I'm afraid I don't quite follow your last paragraph: my intention had been to make it clear that I would certainly be open to talking with you about why you feel the way you do about us as an organization. That remains the case. If you don't want to take me up on that then that is of course your right, though my door remains open if you change your mind. I hope you will. \r\n \r\n Kassiane replied \r\n \r\n An apology isn't an apology if it's an \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" apology. They've all been. And as lovely as Liz and her blog are, this is public ish, after you misrepresented me and used my words without MY permission (i.e. went over my head to an NT to use my words *ABOUT. SELF. DETERMINATION*, which is a big deal), you need to-nay, your whole organization needs to, apologize without appended justification just as publicly as you used my words in the first place. \r\n Apology with justification (anything with a 'but') or that is an \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" is no apology at all. Surely your social skills therapist taught you that? \r\n I'm pretty sure it's no secret why or how I feel about you as an organization, since it's all over my writing, which you clearly can access as you've yoinked stuff from my publications and commented on my blog. And, for that matter, you can probably put together that my blog URL is directed at you and your ilk. \r\n If you don't follow my last paragraph above, there's not a whole lot I can do about that except this:  1. Right after autism every day, your big birth bang, came out, I and at least a dozen other autistics tried to talk to the fledgling organization, only to be ignored or hung up on. \r\n 2. If you don't understand what an unqualified apology is, I'm sure your organization can find you a social skills instructor to explain it. \r\n 3. I see no need to dialogue with people who cannot understand why stealing my words about self determination without asking me (acknowledging my right to self determination) is a violation. That shows some severe lack of acknowledging even my humanity, & I've been dehumanized enough in my life. \r\n 3b. Seriously, your supporters have told me, to my face, to kill myself, in front of the local autism speaks people, who suggested that I get a life. What can you offer me except more abuse and nonpologies? \r\n \r\n Kai from Autism Speaks replied \r\n \r\n Kassiane, \r\n I apologize unreservedly for quoting you in our materials. It should not have happened. I can't go back and change time though, all I can do is let you know that my door is open to you in the event that you want to have a constructive conversation. \r\n kai \r\n \r\n Kassiane replied \r\n \r\n *sigh* \r\n So that's the first \"we screwed up\" without a qualifying \"but your publisher saiiiiiiiiiiiid ok\" or similar that I've heard from y'all. \r\n Now. Please. Tell me your understanding of why it was wrong, preferably using syntax that is not mine. And then do all that somewhere as public as the PDF. Didn't it get a press release? Maybe a really real apology deserves a press release, especially when you take into account the deception & the length of time it went on. \r\n Y'all need to cleanse the cache, as TwitchyWoman said. \r\n And you still haven't told me what you can offer besides the abuse I (and many of us) get at the hands of your supporters. In front of your regional high muckymucks.Constructive conversation is contentless speech; it doesn't on its own mean anything. \r\n \r\n There was no further comment from anyone at Autism Speaks. On January 20,2012,  Kassiane wrote \r\n \r\n No? We don't want to actually apologize on the same level as the offense? Or demonstrate that you understand that it's unacceptable to yoink an exerpt someone wrote on self determination without acknowledging that author's right to self determination? Or try to say that it was ok even when said author has been told to kill herself by official people from your organization? \r\n Surprised? Me? Not even a little. \r\n \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://yesthattoo.blogspot.com/2014/01/autism-speaks-are-work-stealing-white.html", "https://www.facebook.com/boycottautismspeaksnow", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=643204839059286&set=a.617487991630971.1073741827.617475298298907&type=1&stream_ref=10", "http://boycottautismspeaks.com/", "http://timetolisten.blogspot.com/", "http://timetolisten.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/family-services/tool-kits/transition-tool-kit", "http://www.amazon.com/Ask-Tell-Self-Advocacy-Disclosure-Spectrum/dp/1931282587", "http://www.aapcpublishing.net/", "http://www.timetolisten.blogspot.com/2011/02/autism-speaks-shut-up-and-listen.html", "http://www.timetolisten.blogspot.com/2011/02/autism-speaks-shut-up-and-listen.html", "http://www.timetolisten.blogspot.com/2011/02/autism-speaks-shut-up-and-listen.html", "http://www.donotlink.com/daC", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/about-us", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/about-us/press-releases/autism-speaks-and-national-alliance-autism-research-naar-announce-plans-comb", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/site-wide/national-alliance-autism-research", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/about-us/press-releases/autism-speaks-and-cure-autism-now-complete-merger", "http://mikestanton.wordpress.com/2006/08/30/autism-every-day-a-late-response/", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/autism-speaks-dont-speak-for-me/index.php", "http://www.raggededgemagazine.com/departments/closerlook/000677.html", "https://ballastexistenz.wordpress.com/2006/05/16/exactly-who-is-unresponsive-here/", "Autism Speaks/GRASP \u201carticles of understanding\u201d", "https://ballastexistenz.wordpress.com/2006/05/16/exactly-who-is-unresponsive-here/", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2006/07/autism-speaks-poisonous-ideas.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/08/more-hate-speech-from-autism-speaks.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/10/autism-speaks-eugenic-agenda.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/12/ransom-notes-and-autism-speaks-partners.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2009/11/eradicate-autism-speaks.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/09/autism-speaks-media-campaigni-am-autism/", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2009/09/solidarity.html", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=61", "http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/autismspeaks/", "http://asancentralohio.blogspot.com/2009/10/autistic-community-protests-autism.html", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt141178.html", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt110013.html", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt109667.html", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt111711.html", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt180256.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2014/01/autism-peaks-claimed-to-have-fixed-this-on-january-18-2012-they-lied.html", "title": "Autism $peaks Claimed To Have Fixed This On January 18 2012.

Blogging gives us the opportunity to convey messages of hope, strength, and reward alongside the challenges. But it is not without risk: Our blogging can expose us to debate about each care-giving decision. And when we blog, we share not just our stories, but our child\u2019s, in a very public forum. Many of us question our right to do so, even as we also wonder: how else are we going to change the perceptions and policies that impact our children?\u00a0Ellen Seidman\u00a0moderates a conversation with experienced parents, caregivers, and bloggers  Marisa Howard-Karp \u00a0and  Kate Canterbury \u00a0as they tackle these tough questions, head-on. \r\n Liveblogged by Blogher: \u00a0 http://www.blogher.com/blogging-about-your-special-needs-child-0 \r\n Becoming an Expert Advocate \u00a0 \r\n \u00a0The best care, education, and support comes when you know how to fight for it\u2026 for yourself and for your child.

J Biomed Sci. \u00a02002 Jul-Aug;9(4):359-64. \r\n Singh\u2019s work has not been replicated. As Paul Offit wrote on page 45 of  Autism's False Prophets , \r\n \r\n ...a closer look at Singh's science revealed two critical flaws: children with autism didn't have nerve damage and, according to measles experts, the test that Singh had used to detect measles antibodies didn't detect them.\r\n \r\n   Multiple studies in multiple countries with tens of thousands of subjects have repeatedly failed to find an association between measles vaccine and autism. \r\n \r\n   http://www.immunizationinfo.org/issues/iom-reports/measles-mumps-rubella-vaccine-and-autism \r\n http://www.immunizationinfo.org/science/no-evidence-mmr-vaccine-causes-autism \r\n \r\n Walia's #6  goes to a 404 link (page not found). \u00a0In examining the underlying code, there's no URL to a paper. \u00a0Walia may be referring to another deeply flawed Singh paper,\u00a0 Phenotypic expression of autoimmune autistic disorder (AAD): a major subset of autism. , which was listed as #11 on that  infamous list  that Wakefield claimed replicated his papers, which has been widely debunked. About this paper in particular: \r\n \r\n This paper makes assertions that are not supported by the evidence base in the paper. It is mainly a summary of research, with no mention of what children were looked at. Chris found the actual paper ( https://www.aacp.com/Pages.asp?AID=7937&issue=&page=C&UID= ), and among the data used it included a Wakefield paper [therefore] not independent. Also included in the references are papers from questionable journals like Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons and Medical Veritas, which all suddenly makes sense if you see that Singh is  associated  with these  folk  that tick the \"our treatment heals everything\" quack box (see one Singh  study  on PTSD). \r\n \r\n This [paper] looks like it would support a connection between MMR and autism, but since no-one has independently reproduced this and the author stands to make money off the claims this review has to be viewed with extreme reservations. \r\n \r\n \r\n Walia's #7 = Taylor's #8.

There is no question that Hannah Poling has a mitochondrial disorder; in such cases neurological symptoms often develop after 12 months and before 24 months. The \"autistic like\" symptoms demonstrated by Hannah Poling\u00a0 were part of a global encephalopathy caused by a mitochondrial enzyme deficit. \r\n Does this case or this paper\u00a0 \"demonstrate that vaccines can cause autism\"?

Int J Toxicol. 2003 Jul-Aug;22(4):277-85. \r\n The fatally flawed baby-hair study. \r\n The first flaw in the study is the authors' acceptance of the idea of \"excretion into the hair\". It doesn't happen. Blood mercury does not equal hair mercury. The second flaw is the data collection methods (the hair used in the study). The third flaw is that the study found that the autistic children had lower hair mercury levels than the neurotypical controls. Rather than accepting that data, the authors went on to spin \"tooth fairy tales\" to explain why that might be so (the idea that autistic children had impaired mercury excretion). The fourth flaw in the study involves the hair analyzed: the samples had been in storage under unknown conditions for a median of five and a half years. \r\n Do I really need to go on why Holmes et al. is a broken reed?  It was, when published, a footling study. \r\n But wait: One more thing you should know: Holmes et al. 2003 authors' affiliations are given as Safeminds. Safeminds is an acronym for Sensible Action For Ending Mercury Induced Neurological Disorders.

It moved me tremendously the first time I read it, but \u00a0I kept losing where Kelly posted it originally. \u00a0I asked his permission to post it here. \r\n \r\n My 14 year old son has autism. He is geeky, gawky, dorky, sometimes skips when he walks, and runs funny. He is also intelligent, funny, tells horrible jokes, is kind, thoughtful, compassionate, and loves animals. He is a great joy in my life. \r\n But there was a time a time when I was not so sure about what I felt. He was five years old and struggling at times. I wasn't sure how he was going to do in life, how he was going to make it. I was in a great deal of emotional pain. I was talking to my mentor in a program, and felt like I was being torn apart. My younger brother was severely mentally and physically disabled. It tore my parents lives apart, and all I saw was life going down that exact path. I cried out \u201cWhy in hell did God damage my son's brain, why him???\u201d My friend looked at me with great compassion and said \u201c I don't know\u201d. He then asked me \u201cDo you love Tim?\u201d I told him \u201cWith all my heart\u201d. He then said \u201c If I was able to give you the power of God right now...what would you do, what would you change?\u201d. My mind whirled, but I was suddenly stumped. What could I change about him that would not change the parts of him that were unique and beautiful? \r\n The little boy who would run down the daycare hall screaming \"daddy\" and jump into my arms. \r\n The little boy who put his arms around me and tell me he loved me as \u201cbig as the sky\u201d. \r\n The little boy who would crawl into bed with me ask me to read a story with him and then curl up next me asleep. \r\n I realized I loved him exactly the way he was, exactly who he was, perfect, and I would not change a thing. \r\n That does not mean I won't help him be the best person he can be. But it means I am not going to go around thinking he is broken and cursing the world for creating him. I truly pity the parents who are so busy being angry and resentful that they cannot appreciate the beauty of the child they have. I can and I am forever blessed by it. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/06/kelly-m-bray-on-his-son.html", "title": "Kelly M.

Today, you have an opportunity to make these rules law!\u00a0 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government agency that funds most disability service provision in the United States, has put forward a regulation that would set out requirements for how service providers receiving Home and Community Based Services funding can behave.

Blood levels of mercury are related to diagnosis of autism: a reanalysis of an important data set. J Child Neurol. 2007 Nov;22(11):1308-11. \r\n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18006963 \r\n The infamous Desoto & Hitlan paper. \u00a0This was subject to a great deal of critical commentary among scientifically and statistically expert autism parents. \r\n Interverbal & Do'C at Autism Street : \r\n \r\n The core statistical argument in DeSoto & Hitlan (2007) centers on whether a one-tailed test or two-tailed test is appropriate. These tailed tests are a means of determining whether statistical significance has been achieved. DeSoto & Hitlan (2007) note that Ip et al. used a two-tailed test. DeSoto & Hitlan (2007) criticize this choice. They claim that the hypothesis made by Ip et al. (2004) was directional. In the opinion of DeSoto & Hitlan, the authors should have used a one-tailed test.... \r\n \r\n Later in their commentary: \r\n \r\n DeSoto & Hitlan (2007) are correct that a one-tailed test would have been a better match to the way Ip et al. described their hypothesis. However, the two tailed test offered by Ip et al. was more cautious. Further still, as DeSoto & Hitlan (2007) describe clearly in their review of literature, the data concerning autistics and mercury can go either way. While most studies have not shown a statistically significant difference in the hair or blood levels of autistic children compared to non-autistic controls, the statistically significant lower levels of hair mercury found in autistic children in one study (Holmes et al.) compared to the control group in the same study, have led some to introduce the poor-excretion hypothesis for autism. This unpredictability in direction necessitates a two-tailed test. \r\n We also should consider a well-known informal rule that most new research students are likely exposed to in their statistics textbooks. One picks the type of tailed test, before one reviews the data. This is to prevent changing the type of test one uses to get a certain result. DeSoto & Hitlan by their own description had already reviewed the data and afterwards selected their one-tailed test. This violates the rule described above. \r\n \r\n Orac Knows, in a comment on  Mercury, Autism, and A Note on Scientific Honesty \r\n \r\n The Hitlan paper exists only to try to spin a positive result out of a negative result. The \u201cinvestigators\u201d probably saw a p value of around 0.11 in the original study and realized that if they used a one-tail t-test they could cut it in half, to near 0.05. \r\n \r\n EpiWonk: \r\n \r\n We can conclude absolutely nothing about the association of ethylmercury in vaccines to autism from these data. \r\n \r\n Further Commentary: \r\n \r\n November 17, 2007 Do'C & Interverbal, Autism Street, \u00a0 A Tale of Two Tails \r\n November 29, 2007, Notorious LTP,  Pure Pedantry, Mercury, Autism, and a Note on Scientific Honesty \r\n December 10, 2007 Prometheus, A Photon in the Darkness\u00a0 Winter Potporri \r\n January 23, 2008 Do'C & Interverbal, Autism Street,  Desoto & Hitlan, Revisited Part I \r\n January 23, 2008 Do'C & Interverbal, Autism Street,  Desoto & Hitlan, Revisited Part II \r\n January 27, 2008 Do'C, Autism Street,  Desoto & Hitlan Revisited, Part III \r\n July 19, 2008 EpiWonk at EpiWonk  An Introduction to Data Analysis \r\n \r\n Desoto and Hitlan published an updated FAQ page at\u00a0 http://www.uni.edu/desoto/desoto_hitlan_autism.ht ml \r\n So. \u00a0Does this paper \"demonstrate that vaccines can cause autism?\" \u00a0No, no matter how much Desoto and Hitlan tried to spin it, this paper doesn't make the case. \r\n \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/notes/vaccination-challenge/30-scientific-studies-that-demonstrate-vaccines-can-cause-autism/259348200832913", "http://www.adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18006963", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=158", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18006963", "http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2007/11/29/mercury-autism-and-a-note-on-s/", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=158", "http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2007/11/29/mercury-autism-and-a-note-on-s/", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=137", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=162", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=164", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=165#more-165", "http://epiwonk.com/?p=112", "http://www.uni.edu/desoto/desoto_hitlan_autism.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/07/12-blood-levels-of-mercury-are-related-to-diagnosis-of-autism-a-reanalysis-of-an-important-data-set-.html", "title": "12.

They come not just for the balmy weather or the Tex-Mex food but for South by Southwest, a collection of conferences and festivals that's considered one of the most influential happenings on the annual cultural calendar.\" -- CNN, March 10, 2011 \r\n \r\n Inspired by the energy and success of the BlogHer 11  Special Needs Mini-Con ,  Jenn Lee Reeves  has organized a panel proposal for SXSW 12: \r\n Tech Unity: Beyond the Special Needs Hashtag \r\n \r\n Special needs communities unite! This brainstorming session will take a look at how some people have been able to harness the power of online community to bring special needs parents together. We will look at what social tools work and don't work when parents look for ways to get support for their special needs kids. Talk to a special needs parent and you'll realize, this community does not come together often enough to share how we make advocating for our children work. This is not a session looking to find funding for our child's challenges. This is a conversation where anyone with a link to any type of special need can talk about the need for community and advocacy in a culture where abilities of all types should be celebrated. \r\n Questions Answered \r\n \r\n How are you using social spaces to reach out to your special needs community? \r\n Why is the special needs community fractured? Can we work together more? \r\n How can you connect online support communities to families who are not in social media? \r\n What are your personal stories of how you've connected with other special needs families? \r\n What are the best tools to use to reach out and find people who can help you advocate? \r\n \r\n How to vote for this proposal if you aren't yet a registered SXSW user: \r\n \r\n  Go to    http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/users/register?return=%2Fpages%2Ffaq  and register for Panel Picker  \r\n Wait for email; activate account  \r\n Go to     http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/11932\u00a0 \r\n Click on the thumbs up button just below the title. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://sxsw.com/press", "http://supportforspecialneeds.com/mini-con-wrap/", "http://www.jenleereeves.com/about/", "http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/11932", "http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/users/register?return=%2Fpages%2Ffaq", "http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/11932 "], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/08/thinking-of-going-to-sxsw-want-an-innovative-special-needs-panel-vote.html", "title": "Thinking of Going to SXSW?

{"date": "Wednesday, September 14, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Responding to the foolishness written by  Joanna Karpasea-Jones  at a \"women's health site\".\u00a0 \r\n Holmes AS, Blaxill MF, Haley BE. (2003) Reduced levels of mercury in first baby haircuts of autistic children. Int J Toxicol. 2003 Jul-Aug;22(4):277-85. \r\n Joanna uses this citation to make the argument: \r\n \r\n A study in the International Journal of Toxicology found that autistic infants had reduced levels of mercury in their hair, showing that they had not been able to excrete it as effectively as infants who were neurologically normal. \r\n Differential rates of postnatal mercury elimination may explain why similar gestational and infant exposures produce variable neurological effects ... The mothers in the autistic group had significantly higher levels of mercury exposure through Rho D immunoglobulin injections and amalgam fillings number of the mothers' amalgam fillings and their fish consumption as well as exposure to mercury through childhood vaccines, correlations that were absent in the autistic group.\" \r\n So the neurologically normal babies who had been exposed to mercury in the womb via their mother\u2019s fillings or anti-D injections, and after birth in the form of vaccines, had a higher level of mercury showing in their hair. Autistic babies exposed to the same things did not show this same level of mercury because they hadn\u2019t excreted it from their bodies.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Holmes et al. (2003) is one of the weakest of the weak reeds advanced for the argument \"mercury exposure causes autism\". \r\n The most complete analysis of the flaws in Holmes et al. (2003) was written in 2005 by Prometheus, an academic biological scientist who blogs pseudonymously at Photon in the Darkness. \r\n \r\n   http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=12  \r\n http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=16  \r\n http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=17  \r\n \r\n The first flaw in the study is the authors' acceptance of the idea of \"excretion into the hair\".  It doesn't happen.  Blood mercury = hair mercury. \r\n The second flaw is the data collection methods (the hair used in the study ) \r\n The third flaw is that the study found that the autistic children had lower hair mercury levels than the neurotypical controls.  Rather than accepting that data, the authors went on to spin \"tooth fairy tales\" to explain why that might be so (the idea that autistic children had impaired mercury excretion).  The fourth flaw in the study involves the hair analyzed: the samples had been in storage under unknown conditions for a median of five and a half years. \r\n Do I really need to go on why Holmes et al. is a broken reed?  Why Joanna should not have used this study to advance her notion that \"metal metabolism disorders\" are causal in autism? \r\n I don't think so. It was, when published, a footling study, and Joanne, by citing it, revealed her lack of in serious science writing.  Holmes et al. 2003 isn't even a weak reed -- it's an over-cooked noodle. \r\n But wait:  One more thing you should know:  Holmes et al. 2003 authors' affiliations are given as Safeminds.  Safeminds is an acronym for Sensible Action For Ending Mercury Induced Neurological Disorders.  Do you think the authors had an ideological point to make? \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.empowher.com/autism/content/autisms-theoretical-causes-genetics-and-metabolism-editorial?page=0,2", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=12 ", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=12 ", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=17 "], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/09/that-baby-hair-study-from-2003.html", "title": "That \"Baby Hair\" Study from 2003 from Safeminds"},

The study will enroll families with twins throughout California in order to learn whether some characteristics of autism, including impairments in social interaction, language and learning are shared between twins.  By evaluating twins where one or both twins has autism, researchers hope to find out which characteristics of autism are influenced more by genes and which are caused more by something else.  Scientists from Stanford University, Kaiser Permanente, University of California, San Francisco, Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE), the Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders Institute (M.I.N.D), and California CADDRE are collaborating on this study.

(2011) made to come to their conclusions, including the following observation: \r\n The methodology involves some statistical modeling that tries to tease out the sources of variance. However, this modeling is based completely on a multifactorial threshold model for the disorder - the idea that autism arises when the collective burden of individually minor genetic or environmental insults passes some putative threshold. Sounds plausible, but there is in fact no evidence - at all - that this model applies to autism. In fact, it seems most likely that autism really is an umbrella term for a collection of distinct genetic disorders caused by mutations in separate genes, but which happen to cause common phenotypes (or symptoms). \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/08/an_anti-vaccine-administered_survey_back.php#comment-5011466", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/08/an_anti-vaccine-administered_survey_back.php", "http://www.ehib.org/project.jsp?project_key=AUTM08", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/08/an_anti-vaccine-administered_survey_back.php#comment-5011125", "http://evmedreview.com/?p=743", "http://ebdblog.com/2011/07/is-environment-genetics-in-cause-of-autism/", "http://getbetterhealth.com/culinary-metaphor-used-to-understand-gene-environment-interactions/2011.08.24", "http://www.bmedreport.com/archives/29717", "http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2011/07/04/autism-prenatal-risk-factors/", "http://virginiahughes.com/2011/07/14/experts-critique-statistics-conclusion-of-autism-twin-study/", "http://blogs.nature.com/nm/spoonful/2011/07/twin_study_of_autism_rekindles_1.html", "http://autism.about.com/b/2011/07/09/why-a-twin-study-shouldnt-rock-the-autism-world.htm", "https://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/news/2011/experts-critique-statistics-conclusion-of-autism-twin-study", "http://wiringthebrain.blogspot.com/2011/07/environmental-influences-on-autism.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/09/brief-roundup-of-responses-to-hallmayer-et-al-the-california-twin-study.html", "title": "Brief Roundup of responses to Hallmayer et al, the \"California Autism Twin Study\""},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 21, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Day 1: Zoe, adult with autism , addressing Robert Rummel-Hudson, parent of a child with a non-autism communication disabilty \r\n This week,  The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism  is hosting a series of conversations between adults with autism and parents of children with autism.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Why? Because it needs to happen. Because being a parent of a disabled  child is not the same experience as having a disability, and we need to  figure out how we can have productive conversations about that  disconnect -- especially when it affects our ability to work towards  common goals.       Building constructive conversations and creating real social change  isn't a garden party -- it is hard work. It requires steely listening,  forcing ourselves to bench purely defensive reactions, and honestly  trying to understand unfamiliar perspectives and direct criticism. It  might require walking away from the screen and giving yourself time to  process, and that's fine. You don't have to participate in these  dialogues to learn from them.  \r\n \r\n You really have to read the whole post, and the conversations in the comments. Two snippets from \r\n \r\n Some parents just want disabled children to speak and disabled adults to  shut up. We say this because we\u2019re tired of being dismissed. An act at  which some non-disabled parent advocates excel (one could even call it a  \"splinter skill\") is coming up with reasons to disregard what disabled  people have to say about disability. We're too angry (\"You catch more  flies with honey than with vinegar\"). We disagree with them too much of  the time. We're not properly grateful that they've taken a stance as our  allies (\"I'm putting myself out here for disability rights and I  haven't heard a single thank-you from disabled people\"). We're too  idealistic, or else we're too \"small-picture.\" We're too disabled  (\"You're autistic, so your perspective is distorted by your  black-and-white thinking and lack of empathy and I don't have to listen  to you\"). Or we're not disabled enough (\"You're lucky to be able to  write a blog post, but my child is more severely affected so I don't  have to listen to you\"). \r\n [big snip] \r\n If you want to be Not Like That, if you want to be an ally, you have to  be conscious of your privilege and recognize how it shapes your  thinking. You have to listen to what disabled people have to say about  disability \u2013 even if it makes you uncomfortable, even if at first you  think it\u2019s unfair. You have to recognize that you don\u2019t represent us \u2013  we represent ourselves. And if the disability rights movement is going  to model the equality that we all hope to see in the wider world, you  won\u2019t always be leading us \u2013 sometimes we will be leading you. \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \r\n You might also want to read Zoe's blog,  Illusion of Competence . \r\n\r\n \r\n Link to the whole series \r\n Day One:  Zoe of Illusion of Competence to Robert Rummel-Hudson  \r\n Day Two:  Robert Rummel-Hudson to Zoe \r\n Day Three:  Ari Ne'eman of Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN)  \r\n Day Four \r\n Day Five \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-one.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/", "http://illusionofcompetence.blogspot.com/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/search/label/dialogue", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-one.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-two.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-three.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/09/difficult-but-essential-conversations-adults-with-disability-talking-with-parents-of-disabled-childr.html", "title": "Difficult but essential conversations Adults with disability talking with parents of disabled children: Day One: Zoe"},

The dark-ages culture of neglect and abuse remains extremely strong. \r\n The documentary  The Wall or Psychoanalysis Put to the Test for Autism  reveals how outdated theories haunt Autism there. \r\n \r\n \u00a0January 19, 2012\u00a0\u00a0in the New York Times:  A French Film Takes Issue With the Psychoanalytic Approach to Autism\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n \r\n PARIS \u2014 \u201cLe Mur,\u201d or \u201cThe Wall,\u201d a small documentary film about autism released online last year, might normally not have attracted much attention. \r\n But an effort by French psychoanalysts to keep it from public eyes has helped to make it into a minor cause and shone a spotlight on the way children in France are treated for mental health problems. \r\n The documentary, the first film by Sophie Robert, follows two autistic boys: Guillaume, who has been treated with the behavioral, or \u201cAmerican,\u201d approach; and Julien, who has been kept in an asylum for six years and treated with psychoanalysis. Guillaume, though challenged, is functioning at a high level in school. Julien is essentially silent, locked out of society. \r\n \r\n January 20, 2012: Thinking Person's Guide to Autism \u00a0published  A Culture of Abuse: Autism Care in France. \r\n \r\n Many of you readers who are not citizens of France may wonder why you should care about autism in France, and why I am inviting you today to help we French address the problems with autism in France.\u00a0 \r\n My belief is that the \u201cmoral duty to intervene\u201d exists. In France, Human Rights infringements for autistic people are severe and persistent enough to mandate foreign intervention in the debate. \r\n \r\n \u00a0January 26, 2012: Sophie Robert and David Heurtevent  will give a press conference in English in New York City.

{"date": "Tuesday, February 07, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Update February 9 2012: More articles! And words from Humphreys! \r\n \u00a0 Update February 8 2012: More articles! Take action! \r\n You can submit a letter to the editor by going to\u00a0 http://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/letters/sendletter \r\n You can complain to the Irish Press Council: \r\n Press Council of Ireland \r\n 1,2 and 3 Westmoreland street, Dublin 2 Republic of Ireland. \r\n info@presscouncil.ie \r\n \u00a0 It is 2012, and newspapers are still printing  this malignant twaddle about autistics and their parents:  \r\n \r\n What is shocking is that [autism researchers] are one: assuming that autism is a scientific fact and, two: missing the glaringly obvious fact that if the adults they researched live predominently in their heads and possess few or no heart qualities, their children will need to find some way of defending themselves against the absence of expressed love and affection and emotional receptivity. \r\n \r\n In other words, autism is a myth; whatever is wrong with \"those children\" is the fault of the parents; and those who work in science, technology, engineering and math are cold, unfeeling types. \r\n Who said it? \u00a0A man named Tony Humphreys, who advertises himself as \"the most influential psychologist in Ireland\". Casting an eye over his  publication list , I'd call him just a run-of-the-mill self-help guru, selling soothing twaddle (see Steve Salerno's brilliant  SHAM  for background) with an Irish inflection. \u00a0He's virtually unknown over here in the US -- books un-reviewed\u00a0on Amazon; no newspaper coverage, and so on. \u00a0 \r\n \r\n as always, click to embiggen. \r\n \u00a0 \r\n In Ireland, he appears to be well-known, or at least, adept at self-promotion--styling himself as \"Dr.\" and as a \"clinical psychologist\", although his qualifications  seem hard to come by . \u00a0At any rate, he's on the radio and has a gig writing a regular newspaper column for the Irish Examiner. \r\n Update February 9: In an  article at the Irish Examiner , Humphreys \u00a0\"responded to comments on blogs and social media websites which questioned his professional background. He pointed out he had a BA (hons) and MA (hons) in applied psychology from UCC and a PhD in clinical psychology from the University of Birmingham.\" \u00a0 \r\n On Friday, February 3 2012,  The Irish Examiner  ran the above-quoted article (the whole thing is reprinted at Irish Autism Action's Facebook page). \r\n A furore ensued, but the Irish Examiner was unmoved: \r\n \r\n Dr\u00a0Humphreys\u00a0is a highly experienced and well-regarded clinical psychologist, successful author, and broadcaster .\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Today, they published a few rebuttals from parents (see below) but allowed Humphreys to repeat  more inaccurate and offensive remarks :\u00a0 \r\n \r\n My intention in last Friday\u2019s article was to give people information that has emerged in recent times in relation to troubling behaviours in children that are commonly called autistic spectrum disorders (ASD).\u00a0 This ASD perspective has dominated and has been presented as fact. My goal was to show there is another perspective on this and that what has been presented as fact is not fact; it is simply a perspective \r\n \r\n Why should non-Irish autism advocates care? \u00a0Because counter-factual bollocks like Humphrey's spreads like slimemold. \u00a0 Because a lie can go around the world before the truth can get its boots on.  \u00a0Because such opinions lead to treatments that are harmful to autistics and their families. \r\n Sharon F (an Irishwoman and autism parent)  wrote at The Voyage : \r\n \r\n I now think that Humphreys is hoping to not just promote himself and his book at the expense of autistic children, he is hoping to gain customers seeking to redress their failures as parents and fix their children. The biomedical quackery industry have seen parents willing to subject their children to all sorts of unproven and dangerous \"therapies\" when told it would lead to a cure. The psychoanalysts want some of that action. In order to sell their services, they have to convince enough parents that the cause of their children's autism is known and fixable. \r\n \r\n Bock the Robber wrote a detailed critique of each point Humphreys raised at  Tony Humphreys, Clinical Psychologist, blames the parents, and notes: \r\n \r\n Humphreys presumes that autistic children have not received \u00a0a daily diet of nurture, love, affection, patience, warmth, tenderness and kindness . \u00a0An insult to their parents. \u00a0Since he is not an expert in genetics, neurology or biology, he has no business making definitive statements about these things. \u00a0It reflects poorly on him. \u00a0No professional should make make such dogmatic statements about a field he is not qualified in \r\n \r\n Mike Stanton pointed out that as bad as Timimi's  Myth of Autism  is, it didn't help that Humphreys completely misunderstood the book:, \r\n \r\n That is concurring with Humphreys' attack on parents who possess few or no heart qualities?  It seems only right that ill-written books should be ill-read. But, bad as it is, The Myth of Autism does not deserve to be as badly read as it was by Tony Humphreys, if he read it at all. \r\n \r\n Scientist Kevin Mitchell , in a letter to The Irish Examiner \r\n \r\n The article by Tony Humphreys claiming that autism is caused by \"cold\" or emotionally distant parents, displays such willful ignorance, lack of understanding and density of inaccurate and offensive statements that it is shocking that the Irish Examiner would publish it. \r\n \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n Update February 8 2012 \r\n \u00a0 Brian Hughes at The Science Bit has written  \"How to Argue Illogically: Tony's Top Ten Tips\" \u00a0 \r\n \r\n Arguing that if something is a psychological difference then it cannot also a biological difference is an example of an appeal to dualism. As a purported expert, for Humphreys to adopt such an argument betrays a command of his subject that is deficient on a truly breathtaking scale. \r\n \r\n Update February 9 2012 Humphreys quoted Simon Baron Cohen in his essay. \u00a0This was his response: \r\n   \r\n \u00a0 Steve Salerno  on the kind of babble Tony Humphreys emits: \r\n \r\n And yet even when people aren't dying, there is no missing the recklessness of this misbegotten realm. Self-help is not benign. The $11 billion industry can hurt you psychologically, it can hurt you financially and, as we see, it can hurt you physically. It can hurt your family and friends too. \r\n \r\n and \r\n \r\n The trouble is, in order for a self-help  regimen to gain real-world traction, it must be oversimplified. It must be extreme -- polar. Either it offers full absolution from responsibility and blame (i.e. victimization) or it offers the promise of omnipotence (i.e. empowerment). Neither pole has much to do with real life, which, as noted, is heavily nuanced and laden with unknowns. \r\n \r\n I think there's more to come on the story of Tony Humphreys and autism, and I'll be here to get the word out. \r\n Listing Changed February 9 2012 \r\n Humphreys' Articles and Favorable Reaction \r\n \r\n February 3 2012  Tony Humphreys on Autism in the Irish Examiner \"Core

{"date": "Wednesday, September 21, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t From the introduction to  today's post  : \r\n We're hosting a dialogue series this week, between parent Robert Rummel-Hudson, author of Schuyler's Monster and blogger at Fighting Monsters With Rubber Swords; and self-advocates Zoe, blogger at Illusion of Competence, and Ari Ne'eman, President and co-founder of The Autistic Self-Advocacy Network. Why? We want to encourage constructive conversations about disability, and autism.  \r\n Today's post, the third in the series, is from Ari Ne'eman. Ari participated in the discussions surrounding Rob's and Zoe's original posts, was instrumental in getting these Dialogues to happen, and suggested the format they ultimately took.  \r\n Ari Ne'eman is a co-founder of the  Autism Self Advocacy Network (ASAN). \r\n In 2009, President Barak Obama nominated him for  The National Council on Disability .\u00a0 His nomination was  put on hold for a number of months ; he was finally appointed on June 22, 2010, becoming the first person with autism to serve on the council.\u00a0  Steve Silberman's interview with Ne'eman  was published in Wired on October 6, 2010. \r\n Ari  made two points I want to highlight here \r\n One (emphasis added): \r\n While I recognize and respect the role of disabled speakers who choose to talk about their personal lives, most of us didn\u2019t get involved in the disability rights movement to be a resource for parents, however laudable a goal that may be.  We got involved because we have opinions about how this society is approaching disability -- opinions that are certainly informed by our experiences, but are not simply the result of them and shouldn\u2019t be discounted by virtue of our background.  Jim Sinclair has referred to this as the \u201cself-narrating zoo exhibit\u201d problem, and I\u2019ve felt it myself quite a number of times at disability-related events. People want to hear from us, but only if what we have to say is limited to our \u201ctrue life story of overcoming adversity.\u201d Once we start to sneak in political opinions, however, the accusations of \u201cinappropriateness\u201d and \u201cdisrespect\u201d fly fast and thick. \r\n Two (again with emphasis added): \r\n We self-advocates are not a part of the  polis  of the disability community, as society writ large defines it.  The roles that have been written for us are limited to being beneficiaries of others\u2019 advocacy.  And that is why \u2013 whether you like it or not -- the society we live in provides you and other parents with tremendous privilege. Even if you swore off the word from now till the end of time, our culture places you in the position of shepherd and we in the position of sheep. And sheep do not get the opportunity to disagree with the shepherd. Does that seem right to you? \r\n The comments to this post have also been rich and challenging.  Go read. \r\n \r\n Link to the whole series \r\n Day One:  Zoe of Illusion of Competence to Robert Rummel-Hudson  \r\n Day Two:  Robert Rummel-Hudson to Zoe \r\n Day Three:  Ari Ne'eman of Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN)  \r\n Day Four:  Zoe of Illusion of Competence \r\n Day Five:  Robert Rummel-Hudson< /li>  \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-three.html", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/", "http://www.ncd.gov/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/03/ari-neemans-appointment-to-the-national-council-on-disability-on-hold/", "http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/exclusive-ari-neeman-qa/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-three.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-five.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/search/label/dialogue", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-one.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-two.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-three.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-four.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-five.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/09/difficult-but-essential-conversations-day-three.html", "title": "Difficult but essential conversations: Adults with disability talking with parents of disabled children:  Day Three: Ari Ne'eman"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 21, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t This is a revision of a  previous post. \r\n On May 28, 2006, The Daily Mail (UK)\u00a0 published\u00a0 Sally Beck's article,\u00a0 \"Scientists fear MMR link to autism.\"\u00a0 ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-388051/Scientists-fear-MMR-link-autism.html). \u00a0 I will get to the problems with the study, but first, the problem with the article as it now exists online.\u00a0 \r\n The Daily Mail's lack of publication date is a reprehensible failure of  journalism.\u00a0 The internet is an eternal now; the only signpost for  readers is for publishers (including me)\u00a0 to indicate  when  a particular piece was published.\u00a0\u00a0 Beck's article (like many others, not just at the Daily Mail) exists in the \"eternal now\", giving casual readers the false impression that it is current.\u00a0\u00a0 At some point after 2006 The Daily Mail eliminated comments on the article, removing even that clue. It was the date on the comments that alerted me that the article wasn't current. \r\n Every few months,\u00a0 someone comes across Beck's article and assumes (rightly enough, given the context) that the Beck article is current and accurate information. \r\n \u00a0Moving from criticisms of The Daily Mail's internet presence to Beck's article itself and the underlying research: \r\n Back in 2006, what Beck referred to as \"new American research\" was actually a poster presentation at the  2006 International Meeting for Autism Research  (IMFAR). \u00a0 A \"poster presentation\" is a way of presenting preliminary  results from research.In terms of levels of evidence for a particular  hypothesis, it is very weak.\u00a0 (The complete text of the poster  presentation is below.) \r\n The Walker study (never published) in no way validates  Wakefield's fraud .\u00a0 The MMR vaccine never did not cause autism. \r\n I suspect that Wake Forest University, and possibly the lead author,  Walker, was embarrassed, and put out a press release dated\u00a0  June 1,  2006 press release from  Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center  Wake Forest Researcher Warns Against Making Connection Between Presence of Measles Virus and Autism . (The complete text of the press release is below.) \r\n It gets worse.\u00a0 Two of the complainants in the  Omnibus Autism Proceeding , the  Cedillos  and  Hazelhursts ,  relied upon the unpublished Walker et al. research.\u00a0 Both the Special Masters in  the hearings, and the presiding judge in the following Hazelhurst appeal,\u00a0 dismissed the evidentiary value of the Walker et al. study\u00a0  (exerpts from the hearings and the appeal are below).\u00a0 In other words, the Walker data have been examined and found unconvincing, because it was scientifically suspect.\u00a0 \r\n Other coverage in late May and early June, 2006 \r\n \r\n Commentary from Kristina Chew on May 28, 2006  The rush to report on MMR/regressive autism study \r\n June 1, 2006 press release from  Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center  Wake Forest Researcher Warns Against Making Connection Between Presence of Measles Virus and Autism \r\n Commentary from Kristina Chew on June 2 2006  Dr. Stephen Walker: MMR and Autism: no link \r\n Commentary from Kristina Chew of June 3 2006  Dr. Stephen Walker: MMR and Autism: no link 2 \r\n Commentary from Ben Goldacre MD on June 6 2006  MMR is back \r\n \r\n Text from the IMFAR 2006 Program Booklet and Abstracts (PDF),p. 100-101 downloaded from  http://www.autism-insar.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=19&Itemid=82  on January 24, 2010 and transcribed from PDF into text: \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n Persistent Ileal Measles Virus In A Large Cohort Of Regressive Autistic Children With Ileocolitis And Lymphonodular Hyperplasia: Revisitation Of An Earlier Study \r\n Steve Walker, Karin Hepner, Jeffrey Segal, Arthur Krigsman, Wake Forest University School of Medicine \r\n Background: Autistic enterocolitis, consisting of a nonspecific ileocolitis coupled with ileocolonic lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH), was first introduced as a new, potentially virus-induced disease entity eight years ago in a group of ASD children with developmental regression. \r\n Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to examine ileal biopsy tissue in a large cohort of pediatric patients who carry a diagnosis of regressive autism and whose chronic gastrointestinal symptoms warranted diagnostic endoscopic evaluation, for evidence of measles virus RNA. \r\n Methods: Patients who had been diagnosed with autism and who were referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist for evaluation of chronic GI symptoms were eligible to participate in this IRB approved study. For each patient, medical histories, vaccination records, histopathology reports, and ileocolonoscopic biopsy tissue were available for evaluation. Terminal ileum (TI) biopsy tissue was assayed by RT-PCR for the presence of measles virus RNA and PCR-positive samples were sequenced. \r\n Results: Medical and clinical data have been collected for >275 patients who fit the study inclusion criteria. PCR analysis on TI biopsy tissue from an initial 82 patients showed that 70 (85%) were positive for the F gene amplicon. Fourteen have been verified by DNA sequence and an additional 56 amplicons are being sequenced now. Work is ongoing to assay the remaining specimens (~200) and to identify and assay relevant control tissue samples. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this large cohort of pediatric autistic patients with chronic GI symptoms confirm earlier findings of measles virus RNA in the terminal ileum and support an association between measles virus and ileocolitis /LNH.

Downloaded from  http://www.wfubmc.edu/News-Releases/2006/Wake_Forest_Researcher_Warns_Against_Making_Connection_Between_Presence_of_Measles_Virus_and_Autism.htm  on January 22, 2011. \r\n \r\n Wake Forest Researcher Warns Against Making Connection Between Presence of Measles Virus and Autism  6/1/2006 \r\n WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. \u2013 An American scientist whose research replicates a connection published in England in 2002 between the measles virus and bowel disease in autistic children strongly warns against making the \u201cleap\u201d to suggesting that the measles vaccine might actually cause autism. \r\n \u201cThat is not what our research is showing,\u201d said Stephen J. Walker, Ph.D., an assistant professor of physiology and pharmacology at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. Walker and colleagues have issued an abstract to be presented at this week\u2019s International Meeting for Autism Research, indicating that a high percentage of autistic children that they have tested with chronic bowel disease show evidence of measles virus in their intestines. \r\n Some observers have said that the presence of the measles virus indicates a strong possibility that the measles vaccine, a possible source of the virus, could have caused the children\u2019s autism. That possible connection has caused a major controversy in the United Kingdom, where the connection was first made in 2002. The vaccine is first given as part of a triple vaccine called MMR \u2013 for measles, mumps and rubella \u2013 at ages 12-18 months. That is shortly before a particular type of autism (regressive) begins to appear in children afflicted with the condition, which has fueled the speculation about a connection. \r\n Walker says the new research does not support the connection, and he notes that the results have not even been published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cEven if we showed association (between measles virus and bowel disease) and we published it in a peer-reviewed journal, the conclusion will be simply that there is measles virus in the gut of a large number of children who have regressive autism and bowel disease. End of story. \r\n \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything to demonstrate that the measles virus is causing autism or even causing bowel disease.\u201d \r\n Walker explains that exploring the causes of chronic bowel disease in autistic children is the major impetus for his research. \u201cThere are lots of viruses in the gut, and any one of them could be causing inflammation. If it truly is from a vaccine and this virus causes inflammation and a chronic bowel condition in some susceptible children, then that\u2019s something that needs to be known.\u201d \r\n The main task at hand, Walker said, is to determine what is causing the bowel condition in the autistic children, a condition that has a direct influence on cognitive and behavioral issues associated with autism. \r\n A high percentage of autistic children have chronic bowel disease, a discovery in the late 1990s that eventually led to the measles virus connection. \r\n \u201cIf anybody has severe GI problems, it causes problems with focus, it causes problems with everything. You can\u2019t do anything until you get that resolved. We\u2019ve all experienced that. \r\n \u201cThese kids experience it hour after hour every single day of their lives. Many of them are non-verbal so they can\u2019t tell anybody what the problem is, and the behavior that they exhibit as a result of a severe stomach ache was once attributed to just being autistic and having weird behaviors \u2013 for example, leaning over the sharp edge of a coffee table for hours at a time. That seems weird, but what they\u2019re doing is relieving pressure on their lower abdomen.\u201d \r\n Walker said that relieving the bowel discomfort has been shown to improve other conditions associated with autism, such as cognition and the ability to learn. \u201cThere\u2019s case after case where kids improved cognitively, behaviorally and biomedically when you treat the bowel disease. There is a great improvement from better nutrition alone. You see improvements in their overall condition.\u201d \r\n Walker said he will continue to look for possible causes, the biological mechanism, and new treatments of the bowel condition. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal for me: understanding the biology of what\u2019s causing the disease and then gaining insight into the most effective way to treat it, so that clinicians will not have to go through a trial and error approach.\u201d \r\n # # # \r\n Media Contacts: Mark Wright, mwright@wfubmc.edu, Karen Richardson, krchrdsn@wfubmc.edu, or Shannon Koontz, shkoontz@wfubmc.edu, at (336) 716-4587. \r\n Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center is an academic health system comprised of North Carolina Baptist Hospital and Wake Forest University Health Sciences, which operates the university\u2019s School of Medicine.

(Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 634A-35A.) \r\n page 64-65 \r\n c.  The Walker study \r\n Petitioners have also relied on a study that is currently in progress, conducted by Dr. Hepner and several others, often described as the \u201cWalker study.\u201d  (See Ex. 59, Tab K; P. Trial Ex. 3.) Dr. Hepner stated that the \u201cpreliminary data\u201d from that study \u201cpresent another step in support\u201d of the proposition that the measles virus persists in the intestinal tissue of some autistic children.  (Ex. 63, p. 5; see also Tr. 634A-35A.)  After consideration of the Walker study and the testimony about it in the record of this case, however, I conclude that the study does not provide any substantial support to the proposition that the measles virus persists in the bodies of Michelle Cedillo or any other autistic individuals. \r\n Dr. Hepner reported that she and three other researchers--Steve Walker, Jeff Segal, and Dr. Arthur Krigsman, the latter being another of petitioners\u2019 experts in this case--are engaged in a study similar to the Uhlmann study, in that their objective is to perform PCR testing for the detection of measles virus on intestinal biopsies of children with both developmental delay and gastrointestinal symptoms.  (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 634A-35A.)  Dr. Hepner stated that the researchers generated \u201cmultiple primer sets\u201d and \u201ctested them for their specificity and sensitivity\u201d in identifying the presence of measles virus.  (Tr. 635A; Ex. 63, p. 5.)  Dr. Hepner and Dr. Krigsman testified that the study, which began in 2003, is not yet complete, but that the group conducted some initial testing and presented \u201cpreliminary data\u201d from the study at an autism-related conference in 2006, in the form of a \u201cposter presentation\u201d (literally, a poster board describing the study was set on an easel at the conference). (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 474A-75, 634A.)  Dr. Hepner reported that of 82 biopsy samples tested in the study\u2019s initial testing, which all came from children with both \u201cdevelopmental delay\u201d and \u201cGI [gastrointestinal] symptoms,\u201d 70 tested positive for measles virus.  (Ex. 63, p. 5.)  She further stated, without explanation, that her group was able \u201cto confirm vaccine strain specificity\u201d in some of the positive samples.  (Tr. 635A.) \r\n Petitioners, in their post-hearing briefs, have relied on the Walker study as supportive of their view that the Unigenetics measles virus testing should be considered reliable.  (P1, pp. 141, 154-55, 242; P3, pp. 33-34.)  After full consideration, however, I cannot agree. First, two of respondent\u2019s experts, Dr. Ward and Dr. Bustin, each pointed to a number of flaws in the Walker study, based on the description in the poster presentation.  (Tr. 1861-65; 1952A- 59A.) \r\n Moreover, a second important reason to discount the Walker study is the testimony of Dr. Hepner herself.  Dr. Hepner stated that the initial data from her study were only \u201cvery preliminary data.\u201d  (Tr. 659.)  She acknowledged that it would be inappropriate to \u201cdraw any conclusions\u201d from those preliminary results.  (Tr. 682.)  She acknowledged that her group at this time is still attempting \u201cto test this assay, to optimize the assay\u201d (Tr. 660A)--i.e., to develop the test to a point where they can then be confident that their test is yielding reliable results.  Part of developing any such test is to use \u201cnegative controls\u201d--i.e., to test samples that are known to be free of the target, to make sure that the test is not erroneously identifying the target in samples that do not contain it.  However, Dr. Hepner explained that her group is still at the point of developing their negative controls.  (Tr. 658, 681.) \r\n In short, Dr. Hepner was forthright in acknowledging that, in terms of drawing any conclusions with regard to the issue of the validity of measles virus testing, the preliminary data available from her study simply are \u201cnot useful at this time.\u201d  (Tr. 659.) In sum, it is clear that the Walker study must be disregarded.  First, both Dr. Ward and Dr. Bustin pointed out a number of reasons why one cannot draw any conclusions from, or place any reliance on, the preliminary data from the Walker study.  And even petitioners\u2019 expert Dr. Hepner, one of the study\u2019s own authors, has acknowledged that the preliminary data from the study are \u201cnot useful at this time.\u201d  (Tr. 659.)  Accordingly, I must agree with Dr. Hepner on this point.  I conclude that the Walker study is not useful in deciding the issue of whether the Unigenetics measles virus detection testing was reliable. \r\n p. 71 \r\n b.  The Walker study \r\n Petitioners also, in their final post-hearing brief in this case, pointed to another item of evidence in the record.  (P4, pp. 33-34.)  They pointed to the ongoing Walker study, discussed above, and note that one of their experts who has worked on that study, Dr. Krigsman, stated that in the study\u2019s initial testing, six specimens were determined to be positive \u201cfor vaccine-strain-specific RNA.\u201d  (Tr. 487A.)  However, as I have already discussed above, the preliminary data from the Walker study, in the words of the petitioners\u2019 own expert and co-author of that study, Dr. Hepner, is simply \u201cnot useful at this time.\u201d  (Tr. 659.)  Thus, again in Dr. Hepner\u2019s own words, it would not be appropriate for me to \u201cdraw any conclusions\u201d from that data.  (Tr. 682.) \r\n \r\n Selected abstracts from the Hazelhurst decision  ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/.../Campbell-Smith%20Hazlehurst%20Decision.pdf \r\n OFFICE OF SPECIAL MASTERS  E-Filed: February 12, 2009  No. 03-654V \r\n P. 148-149 \r\n \r\n I. The Preliminary Findings of the Walker Study \r\n Petitioners also rely on unpublished findings of measles virus in tested bowel tissues taken from autistic children as support for their claim regarding measles persistence.  Petitioners\u2019 expert Dr. Hepner expressed the opinion that the published 2002 Uhlmann findings are \u201creliable,\u201d see Cedillo Tr. at 639, and her confidence in the reported positive findings of measles virus is bolstered by the preliminary findings of a study on which she is working.  Dr. Hepner discussed her current work with a team of investigators in the laboratory of Dr. Stephen Walker at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  Dr. Hepner described the project as a study \u201cto create a highly reproducible, highly sensitive, very specific . . .  experimental design to detect [measles virus] RNA in the bowel biopsies of ASD patients.\u201d  Id. at 634A-635A.  She stated that the preliminary findings of the study, which were presented as an abstract at the June 2006 International Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR), confirm the presence of vaccine strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested.  Id. at 635. \r\n Dr. Hepner stated that while positive controls (specifically \u201can artificial laboratory construct\u201d of wild-type measles virus) have been run in each experimental run in the study, no negative controls have been run to date because the investigators are still looking for suitable negative controls.  Id. at 658, 663, 674-675.  The experimental controls are patients who do not have ASDs but have gastrointestinal symptoms.  Id. at 675.  The experimental group includes ASD patients who have \u201c[inflammatory bowel disease]-like symptoms, but not all of whom have received the MMR vaccine.\u201d  Id. at 676.  She described the preliminary results of the experiments as \u201ca technical achievement\u201d because the investigators \u201cbelieve that they have developed some assays to detect [measles virus] in this cohort of patients in biopsied tissue that is vaccine strain specific.\u201d  Id. at 682.  But Dr. Hepner declined to \u201cdraw any conclusions about the biological significance\u201d of the investigators\u2019 findings.  Id. \r\n However, respondent\u2019s expert Dr. Bustin expressed some concern about the preliminary PCR results reported in the Walker abstract presented at the IMFAR conference and discussed in Dr. Hepner\u2019s testimony.  Dr. Bustin\u2019s chief concern after reviewing the slides from the poster presentation is that there is evidence from the location of the bands in the experimental gel that the obtained results are not specific for the intended target.  See id. at 1955A-1958A.  Because the experiment did not include a negative control, a proper determination of what the observed bands show cannot be made. See id. at 1958.  In the absence of both positive and negative controls during a PCR run, Dr. Bustin stated that he \u201c[could not] have any confidence\u201d in the test results.  Id. at 1959A. \r\n The testimony during the Cedillo hearing of the parties\u2019 experts, Dr. Hepner for petitioners and Dr. Bustin and Dr. Ward for respondent, made clear that standard laboratory practice requires that positive samples (that always contain the targeted material), negative samples (that never contain the targeted material), experimental samples (the subjects with an exposure of interest tested for the presence of the targeted material), and control samples (the subjects without the exposure of interest tested for the presence of the targeted material) are run during each experiment.  See Cedillo Tr. at 620A, 621A, 627A, 677 (Dr. Hepner); id. at 1842 (Dr. Ward); id. at 1959A (Dr. Bustin). The use of the positive and negative controls provides information about the internal consistency of the experiments.  Informed that test results without the use of these controls during PCR experiments may not be reliable, the undersigned cannot place much weight on the preliminary findings of Walker study (addressed by petitioners\u2019 experts Drs. Corbier, Hepner, and Krigsman), specifically the alleged findings of vaccine-strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested. \r\n pp 175-176 \r\n Petitioners\u2019 claim that the measles virus can persist in the gut of certain vaccinated children and cause inflammation is based on reported findings of persistent measles virus in the biopsied gut tissue taken from autistic children who have received the MMR vaccine and developed gastrointestinal symptoms.  Petitioners\u2019 reliance, however, on the published reports of positive test results, the unpublished positive findings of the preliminary Walker study, and the positive lab results obtained by Unigenetics lab from biopsied gut tissue taken from children involved in the OAP litigation is unavailing.  Strong evidence, including highly credible expert testimony, indicates there were numerous irregularities in the testing procedures.  Those irregularities compromised the integrity of the conducted tests and have rendered the test results unreliable.  Underscoring the unreliability of the test results is the inability of other laboratories (that is, accredited laboratories not affiliated with either Dr. Wakefield, his colleagues, or the Unigenetics lab) to replicate the reported findings in gastrointestinal tissues or blood cells. \r\n Petitioners\u2019 theory is based on the characteristics of the wild-type measles virus rather than on the characteristics of the attenuated vaccine-strain measles virus. Petitioners\u2019 theory is further based on unreliable reports of positive measles findings.  The bases for petitioners\u2019 theory that the measles component of the MMR vaccine can lead to the development of autism are unsound.  Petitioners have failed to offer reliable support for the proposition that the MMR vaccine can cause autism and have failed to meet their burden of proof under the first prong of the Althen standard. \r\n \r\n Selected abstracts from the Hazelhust appeal,\u00a0 http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=in%20fco%2020100513188.xml&docbase=cslwar3-2007-curr \r\n downloaded January 24 2011 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n The Hazlehursts also argue that the special master disregarded critical evidence regarding the reliability of the Walker group's test results, in violation of the Vaccine Act's requirement to consider \"all . . . relevant medical and scientific evidence.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(b)(1). They assert that the special master ignored evidence\u2014 including testimony from Dr. Hepner and exhibits from the Walker group's 2006 IMFAR poster presentation\u2014showing that the Walker group used genetic sequencing to verify its test results. If the special master had given that evidence proper consideration, the Hazlehursts argue, she would have found that the Walker study reliably detected persistent vaccine-strain measles virus in the bowels of autistic children. The Hazlehursts therefore assert that the special master's decision to accord little weight to the Walker group's test results was arbitrary and capricious. We disagree. \r\n As an initial matter, even if the special master had made no explicit reference to the evidence that the Walker group used genetic sequencing, we would presume that she considered that evidence. See Medtronic, Inc. v. Daig Corp., 789 F.2d 903, 906 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (\"We presume that a fact finder reviews all the evidence presented unless he explicitly expresses otherwise.\"). In this case, however, it is not necessary to rely on that presumption, as the special master's opinion specifically refers to that evidence. Discussing Dr. Krigsman's testimony, the special master explained: \r\n Dr. Krigsman stated that the preliminary findings of that [Walker group] study show that based on the obtained PCR results, measles virus is present in the biopsied gastrointestinal tissue taken from patients with autism and bowel disease and examined by Dr. Krigsman. Dr. Krigsman acknowledged, however, as did Dr. Hepner, that not all of the samples had been sequenced for vaccine strain measles. \r\n Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *139 (citations to exhibits and testimony omitted). Thus, the special master clearly understood the testimony that some, though not all, of the Walker group's samples were sequenced to confirm vaccine-strain specificity. Moreover, the exhibits that the special master cited in her opinion included the June 2006 IMFAR abstract and IMFAR poster presentation\u2014the very documents that the Hazlehursts contend were \"ignored.\" We thus cannot conclude that the special master failed to consider the evidence in question, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(b)(1). \r\n In any event, an examination of the cited exhibits and testimony reveals inconsistent and preliminary data that provides only minimal support for the petitioners' claim that the Walker group confirmed the presence of vaccine-strain measles virus, as opposed to wild-type measles virus. While the abstract states that \"PCR analysis on. . . tissue from an initial 82 patients showed that 70 (85%) were positive\" for measles virus, the poster presentation states that \"PCR analysis on . . . tissue from an initial 86 patients showed that 57 (66%) were positive\" for measles virus. With respect to sequencing, the abstract observes that \"[f]ourteen [samples] have been verified by DNA sequence,\" but it does not state whether the sequencing was vaccine-strain specific. The poster presentation, on the other hand, states: \"Thirty five [samples] have currently been verified by DNA sequence. Six of the thirty five MV [measles virus] positive [samples] bear sequence that is specific to vaccine strain MV.\" That information, which suggests that only a small number of samples were successfully sequenced for vaccine-strain measles virus, is confirmed by Dr. Krigsman's testimony: \"All we could say at the time of this poster is that, as far as vaccine-strain-specific sequencing positivity, a total of six specimens [] were positive . . . . So genetic material that was specific for vaccine-strain measles virus was positive in six.\"[ 3 ] Given that the Walker group's data reflects only a small amount of vaccine-strain-specific sequencing, it was not inappropriate for the special master to include only a brief discussion of the Walker group's sequencing efforts in her opinion. \r\n The special master's decision to accord little weight to the Walker group's data was largely based on the study's other shortcomings and was thus well within her discretion in weighing the evidence. Most significantly, the special master found that the Walker group's research was unpublished, preliminary, and incomplete. Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *124-25, *139, *150. Embodied only in a poster presentation, the Walker study was not subject to peer review and therefore has not been subjected to scrutiny from the greater scientific community. See id. at *16, quoting Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 594 (1993) (\"The fact of publication (or lack thereof) in a peer reviewed journal thus will be a relevant, though not dispositive, consideration in assessing the scientific validity of a particular technique or methodology.\"). In fact, Dr. Krigsman and Dr. Hepner repeatedly described the Walker group's data as \"partial\" and \"preliminary.\" As the special master observed, Dr. Hepner testified that she \"certainly wouldn't draw any conclusions about the biological significance\" of the Walker group's test results at that early stage. In particular, Dr. Hepner noted the lack of a \"proper control source\" of tissue samples from children without autism spectrum disorders. She explained that the Walker group's current data does \"not give us any information yet about this cohort of patients relative to a different cohort of patients.\" \r\n The special master also expressed misgivings about the Walker group's use of controls in its study. The special master noted that \"while positive controls (specifically `an artificial laboratory construct' of wild-type measles virus) have been run in each experimental run in the study, no negative controls have been run to date because the investigators are still looking for suitable negative controls.\" Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *125. In their reply brief, the Hazlehursts dispute the special master's statement that \"no negative controls have been run.\" They argue that negative \"technical\" controls were run with every sample to check for contamination and to assure the reliability of the PCR testing, even though the Walker group lacked certain \"experimental\" controls, namely, control samples of tissue from children who tested negative for autism. \r\n The record is unclear as to precisely what negative controls were run. Although Dr. Hepner testified that \"no-template negative controls\" were run \"as a control for contamination,\" she also stated that the Walker group was still \"in the process of procuring samples that would be appropriate negative controls.\" She further noted that \"the negative control at this point generally has been a no-template control because we don't have access to the right material.\" The confusion is compounded by Dr. Bustin's testimony that he could not rule out the possibility of contamination\u2014suggested by several indicators of unidentified genetic material in the Walker group's poster presentation\u2014because \"there's no negative control there.\" \r\n What is clear from the record is that, at the time of the omnibus autism hearings, certain key controls used by the Walker group were incomplete and in flux. Most critical is the undisputed lack of a sufficient control group of non-autistic children with which to compare the positive findings in autistic children. If the Walker group were to find persistent measles virus at comparable rates in both autistic and non-autistic children, for example, such a finding would significantly undermine the petitioners' theory that persistent measles virus contributes to the causation of autism spectrum disorders. Moreover, Dr. Hepner's testimony suggests that the Walker group was also seeking a different type of positive control to rule out the possibility of cross-contamination. That evidence further underscores the preliminary and unconfirmed nature of the Walker group's results. \r\n Like the Court of Federal Claims, we do not believe that the Walker group's small amount of vaccine-strain-specific genetic sequencing \"carries enough weight to overcome the special master's conclusion that the Walker group's results were preliminary, unpublished, and not entitled to substantial weight.\" Hazlehurst, 88 Fed. Cl. at 488. We therefore find no error in the special master's determination that she could not \"place much weight on the preliminary findings of Walker study . . . specifically the alleged findings of vaccine-strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested.\" Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *125.

Meryl, welcome to the show. \r\n \r\n The \"questions about the safety of compulsory vaccinations\" are raised only by those who oppose vaccinations and whose goals are the elimination of vaccine programs. \r\n Why did the Executive Report choose to interview Ms. Dorey, a woman with only a high-school diploma and no known training in immunology, vaccinology, or epidemiology? Ms. Dorey's problems with  telling the truth  and  accuracy about vaccines  and did I mention her  little fundraising problem \u00a0and her  other little fundraising problem ? And  that other one.  I would like to know why.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Meryl: Thanks very much. \r\n ER: Now Meryl, vaccines are designed to repress disease but there\u2019s been some recent issues with the whooping cough vaccine that might be a sign of things to come. What\u2019s going on there? \r\n \r\n Why are they asking this ignorant woman? \u00a0Why not someone from  Immunise Australia \u00a0or  Professor Peter McIntyre  or  Julie Leask  or even\u00a0Tom Sidwell, a PhD candidate in immunology who is a gifted science writer? \r\n \r\n Meryl: Well, vaccines are made to create antibodies, and antibodies only mean that you\u2019ve been exposed to a disease; they don\u2019t mean that you\u2019re immune.  \r\n \r\n My jaw dropped when I read that. \u00a0On the whole,  having the disease and having the vaccine against the disease activate the same immune response . \u00a0Ms. Dorey is a \" vaccine expert \" and can spout such easily refutable nonsense? \r\n \r\n And what we\u2019ve found with the whooping cough vaccine is that, yes, it is creating the antibodies, but it\u2019s also bringing a new disease, a new form of whooping cough to the fore and this form of disease is not covered by the vaccine. \r\n \r\n This is just crazy talk and completely inaccurate. \u00a0What is accurate: \r\n \r\n Since 2005, we've known that \" infection-acquired immunity against pertussis disease wanes after 4-20 years and protective immunity after vaccination wanes after 4-12 year s\" \r\n We know that the acellular pertussis vaccine  only has an effectiveness rate of 80-85% \r\n Evidence for \"new disease\" is fain t\u00a0 \r\n Yes, some of the genotypes have shifted,  but the shift doesn't seem to affect the potency of the vaccine. \r\n \r\n This is what science  does:  continue to grow, to address problems. \u00a0 \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n  So in the United States and overseas we\u2019re seeing record numbers of cases of this whooping cough. \r\n \r\n Yes, California had whooping cough \u00a0in 2010 but in 2011 not so much. \u00a0Why? Think the adolescent booster campaign had anything to do with it? And gee, only 11% of Australian adults are current on vaccines (including a pertussis vaccine in the prior ten years). \u00a0Do you think the low vaccination rate might have something to do with the pertussis epidemic in Australia? \r\n \r\n We\u2019re seeing more cases than we\u2019ve had since before the vaccine was introduced \r\n \r\n She has made this claim before  and had it thoroughly debunked . She's lying, pure and simple.\u00a0 Furthermore, Dorey is ignoring the changes and advances in diagnostic techniques, such as PCR, have made in reported rates. \r\n \r\n and it\u2019s a much more dangerous disease. \r\n \r\n This is an assertion without evidence. \" Whooping cough deaths were higher during the 1990 s\".\u00a0 \r\n \r\n So for the first time in decades we\u2019re seeing babies die. So the vaccine\u2019s not working and we\u2019re seeing similar situations with measles and mumps and we may see this with more diseases into the future. So we need to look at what we\u2019re doing. \r\n \r\n Babies have been dying of pertussis  all along: \" From 1993 \u2013 2008, 16 babies under 12 months lost their lives to pertussis. Fatalities continue right up to the present day. \" So Dorey's claim of:\u00a0\"... first time in decades \" a flat lie. \u00a0 \" Vaccine not working \"? \u00a0And the  measles  and  mumps  vaccines \"aren't working\" claim is an easily refutable lie. \r\n \r\n ER: Now what\u2019s your view on the state of autism as it relates to vaccinations? \r\n \r\n Why are they asking this woman with a high-school education and no expertise in autism? \u00a0Wouldn't they have been better off asking an expert like\u00a0 Bruce Tonge ? \r\n \r\n Meryl: Well, autism has been related to vaccination in the medical literature for a very long time, \r\n \r\n No it hasn't. \u00a0A simple search for vaccine autism on PubMed reveals only 4 citations prior to 1998, including a review of Harris Coulter's 1993 crank screed against vaccination. but that's hardly \"medical literature\". \u00a0 The vaccine-autism connection was first, \u00a0Wakefield's  MMR theory  in 1998, and then the  equally flawed mercury theory  in 2001. \u00a0Both have been evaluated in studies having hundreds of thousands subjects, and no connection has been found. \r\n \r\n but the study that everybody talks about is the one by Andrew Wakefield that was printed in 1998 in the Lancet. And this study says that the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine maybe a cause of autism. A lot of people are saying that this journal article has been discredited \r\n \r\n Yes. \u00a0Even the majority of Wakefield's co-authors withdrew their names from the paper, six years after publication. \u00a0 The paper was finally retracted in 2011. \u00a0 Wakefield falsified data. \r\n \r\n  but what they\u2019re ignoring is the fact that since this original paper was published, there have been many other papers verifying this finding. \r\n \r\n Dorey can't even get her misinformation (actually, lies) right. No paper has replicated Wakefield's \" autistic entercolitis \" finding. \u00a0No paper has replicated the  MMR-autism link . No paper has  replicated any gut-autism  causation. \r\n \r\n So again, we have the question \u201care vaccines related to autism?\u201d. We\u2019ve had an increase of autism from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 88, and the only common denominator seems to be the increasing use of vaccinations. \r\n \r\n \"The only common denominator\"?  No , no and again no. \u00a0Do I have to say it again? \u00a0 Vaccines do not cause autism . ( A nice list of things that have changed since the 1980s ) \r\n Here are some of the factors in increased identification of autism: \r\n \r\n What about diagnostic expansion? (Here's the  difference across DSM I through IV ) \r\n What about  diagnostic substitution ? \r\n What about  underdiagnosis in the past ? \r\n What about  improved ascertainment ? \r\n What about the  addition of autism as a special education category ? \r\n What about increased awareness, or \" social influence \"? \r\n \r\n I'm sure this list isn't exhaustive. It just goes to show how wrong Ms. Dorey is. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n So we need to look at this openly and not try and suppress the information. \r\n \r\n For my money, the autism and vaccines question has been addressed about as openly as possible. \u00a0Who is suppressing \"information\"? \u00a0Nothing is being \"suppressed\". \u00a0The facts are that  MMR vccines do not cause  autism. \u00a0 Mercury in vaccines does not cause autism. \u00a0 The two together don't cause autism.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n ER: So Meryl, what do you feel we should do to ensure the wellbeing of all children? \r\n Meryl: Well, vaccination is a medical procedure and it carries with it risks and benefits. So parents need to be aware of all of the information. We need to have real access to information \r\n \r\n I wonder if Meryl knows how to use  PubMed , or the  Pink Book. \u00a0 And hey! \u00a0There's the internet, with resources like the  National Network for Immunization Information\u00a0 \u00a0and  Every Child by Two  and  Vaccinate Your Baby \u00a0and the  Vaccine Education Center at CHOP  and more. \u00a0If that's not \"real access to information\" I don't know what is. \r\n \r\n and vaccination should never be compulsory because it is not 100% safe, \r\n \r\n Nirvana fallacy !  Nothing  is \"100%\". \u00a0However,  driving your child to a doctor's appointment which would include vaccination  is riskier than having the vaccine. \r\n \r\n  and no government has the right to say \u201cyou have to put your child\u2019s health at risk because we have made this procedure compulsory\u201d. \r\n \r\n It \u00a0has been shown again and again that vaccines are a very low-risk medical intervention. \u00a0Vaccines do not put a \"child's health at risk\". \u00a0In fact,  failing to vaccinate significantly raises the risk of illness for your child. \u00a0 \r\n \r\n  Vaccines have not been subjected to true double-blind trials. They need to be done. They\u2019ve also never been scientifically tested independently. Most vaccine trials, like most drug trials, are paid for by the pharmaceutical companies that makes the vaccines. We need the government to take a stand on this. And most importantly, we need this study that we\u2019ve been asking for for decades, which compares the overall health of the fully-vaccinated with the fully-unvaccinated. \r\n \r\n The famous study. \u00a0I know the anti-vaccine brigade \"have been asking for it\" since 1998 or so, but have never accepted why it would be  unethical . \u00a0And the  natural experiments  have  been done , and found the  vaccinated children are healthie r. \r\n \r\n And when that study is done, parents will finally have confidence to say, \u201cyes, we\u2019re going to vaccinate because we feel it\u2019s in our child\u2019s best interests\u201d. \r\n ER: Meryl, this has been very informative.

Most of this post is about  the ill-fated NIMH chelation for autism study , \u00a0but Willingham addressed some significant flaws in the first two poster presentations, namely, the undisclosed conflicts of interest, and sharply questioning the framing of the discussion: \r\n Willingham highlights \u00a0the connection between Thoughtful House and the 3 poster presentations, a conflict of interest that is not disclosed. \r\n Posters 3024 and 3028 use the phrase \"Childhood vaccines are a possible causal factor in autism\". \u00a0This is an astonishing assertion:\u00a0 by 2008, there was\u00a0\u00a0\"no peer-reviewed published research confirming this statement--especially the \"causal\" part--and a substantial amount countering it\". \r\n Poster 3024 asserts, and 3028 implies two things: (a)\u00a0the majority of childhood vaccines contained thimerosal and (b)the  thimerosal  might be the vaccine component associated with autism. \u00a0This is simply silly on both counts: it is not true that \"the majority\" contained thimerosal; the MMR vaccine never contained thimerosal; and pediatric vaccines became thimerosal-free in 2001. \u00a0 \r\n \r\n October 7 2009  Catarina \u00a0Science Mom at JustTheVax  20 Monkeys , which discusses the withdrawn 2009 Hewitson HepB study in\u00a0 NeuroToxicology. \u00a0 She finds that there are multiple procedural and study-design flaws that render the study almost worthless: \r\n The three IMFAR posters mentioned above are clearly part of the same set of monkey studies \r\n There was no randomization of the subjects. \u00a0A study either is randomized or not.\u00a0 \r\n Since there was only one interpreter of the monkeys' behavior pre- and post-vaccine administration, no blinding was possible, introducing another layer of potential biase. \r\n It seems that an additional 4 control animals were added after the IMFAR poster presentations. \u00a0Rather than strengthening the study, the late addition of subject weakens study as it adds a possibly confounding variable. \r\n The authors failed to publish baseline biochemical data, such as blood mercury levels pre- and post-injection. \r\n The authors collected data on 18 behaviors and published tables on 13 behaviors. \u00a0H0wever, \u00a0only 3 reached statistical significance. \r\n The significant conflicts of interest of 3 authors (Hewitson, Wakefield, and Stott) are noted, with a particular emphasis on Stott. \r\n The study was funded by a collection of groups and individuals with vested interests in finding vaccines harmful to health and causal in autism. \r\n \r\n October 7 2009 Orac at Respectful Insolence  Some Monkey Business in Autism Research  discussing the withdrawn 2009\u00a0Hewitson study in\u00a0 NeuroToxicology ; \r\n \"Even if the study was well designed and executed (which it is not), and even if the study conclusively showed delayed development of survival reflexes (which it does not), it is still a very, very, very long leap to conclude that vaccines and or thimerisol are responsible for increased autism rates in humans.\u00a0 \r\n These \"survival\" reflexes (called \"primitive reflexes\" in humans) are present at birth in human infants and their \u00a0absence would be noted by any competent pediatrician. \r\n Absence or delayed appearance of \"primitive reflexes\"\u00a0 is not \u00a0a feature of autism. \r\n   \r\n October 24, 2009 Prometheus at Photon in the Darkness  A Made for Court Study? \u00a0(This is another of Prometheus's master class in how to read and analyze scientific papers -- you would do well to study his technique) \r\n \"Most fatal for this study \u2013 is that there was\u00a0 not \u00a0an increase in human infants who were late to suck, root, etc. following the introduction of neonatal hepatitis B vaccination in 1991. Given that the \u201cuptake\u201d of this vaccine at birth was close to (and often exceeded) 90%, an effect of this magnitude would have been noted.\u00a0Nor is there a difference between the US \u2013 which has continued hepatitis B vaccination at birth \u2013 and the UK \u2013\u00a0 which almost never gives the hepatitis B vaccine at birth \u00a0\u2013 in developmental delay or autism prevalence.\" \r\n \"This current study, as well as the\u00a0 entire macaque research program\u00a0 by Hewitson, is a good example of terrible research. The subject numbers are far too small for any meaningful statistics, and the outcomes being followed are numerous and tricky with a random scatter of results not even consistent between different publications of the same research.\" \r\n \"What we have is far worse than ideological reporting and spinning of the scientific research \u2013 apparently we have the ideological conduction of research in the first place. This is similar to the research program of Benveniste on homeopathy.\" \r\n \r\n February 12, 2010 Prometheus at Photon in the Darkness  Where are the Monkeys? \u00a0(on the sudden withdrawal of the 2009 HepB paper in\u00a0 NeuroToxicology) \r\n February 12, 2010 Orac at Respectful Insolence  Wakefield's \"Monkey Business\" Hep B paper withdrawn? \u00a0(on the sudden withdrawal of the 2009 HepB paper in\u00a0 NeuroToxicology) \r\n July 16, 2010 Steven Novella at Neurologica  Blog Terrible Anti-Vaccine Study, Terrible Reporting , on the\u00a02010 paper in\u00a0 Acta Neurobiol Exp \u00a0(Wars). 2010;70(2):147-64.

{"date": "Monday, February 27, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t 3/4/2012 Updated, up front. \r\n The woman who wrote the \"Autism Can #Suckit\" post has made a remarkable apology. \u00a0You should read it:  The Evolution of an Apology \r\n 2/29/2012: Updated: see bottom of post \r\n A woman in my blogging circle has lupus. \u00a0About a year ago, she started using the hashtag #suckit to  publicize a fundraising effort for lupus research , even having a  #suckit label on her wheelchair . \r\n \r\n Lupus has now become our arch nemesis . And our family is dedicated to kicking it's ass. No one likes what it has put me through- 3 surgeries- 5 hospital stays- countless pills, weekly injections and even chemo. Yes, Lupus can suck it.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n \u00a0For the rest of Erin's  SuckItLupus posts, go here . \u00a0The phrase, with the hashtag and suckit all one word, seemed to become popular about three years ago: \r\n \r\n It's from IRC\u00a0lingo\u00a0for a\u00a0chat channel\u00a0- in this case, the author is asking you to take your concerns to the \"#suckit\" channel. \r\n \r\n \u00a0Denise even  published a #suckit list . Some people use it to talk to diseases in their lives: \r\n \r\n Type 1 Diabetes can suck it\u00a0 \r\n Type 1 Diabetes hypoglycemic episodes can suck it \r\n 98% of the time, this family's life with multiply-disabled children is great, but  the 2% can suck it. \r\n Cancer can suck it \r\n Suck it, cerebral palsy \r\n \r\n You get the picture. Did these posts start the slightest bit of controversy? \u00a0No. The phrase has picked up in popularity recently, at least in some blogging circles. \r\n Back in 2010, my blog-pal  Ellen Seidman  (who writes  Love That Max ) wrote a blog-post  An ad campaign for kids with \u00a0special needs? \u00a0Bring it on! \u00a0In that blog post, she wrote the words,\u00a0 \r\n \r\n I could see a whole \"Suck it!\" campaign: Suck it, cerebral palsy! Suck it, autism! Suck it, Down Syndrome! Suck it, PDD! Suck it, Tourette's! \r\n \r\n Did that cause controversy? \u00a0No. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Possibly because the language was in the context of an awareness/acceptance campaign. \r\n Recently, an autistic child made a huge step forward, one his parents and teachers had been working toward for years. \u00a0His mother, overjoyed, announced to the world (via social media) her joy over her son's accomplishment, and her determination that he will continue to make similar accomplishments, with the following: \r\n \"DO YOU HEAR THAT AUTISM? \r\n \u00a0 I\u2019m going to teach my son to read, so SUCK IT.\u201d \r\n And that's when the conversation took its first turn toward ugly. \u00a0An autistic adult questioned the mother about her use of \"suck it\" relative to autism, and then the mother had a choice: to hear what the autistic had to say about that kind of language, or to respond with hostility, inaccurate declarations, and distortions of what neurodiversity and autism acceptance really means. \u00a0The mother chose the latter course. \r\n Many autistic adults are quite clear that while they value their own autism, they also have significant challenges . \u00a0One clear example was written nearly two years ago by Corina Lynne Becker,  What I Want People to Know , which has the following passage: \r\n \r\n I want to be very honest with you. I am an adult living on social assistance, in a shared accommodation run by a non-profit housing organization. Despite being highly educated, I find it difficult to find and maintain a job on my own, and I\u2019m not even sure that I ever will. I struggle to survive with few to no supports, mostly my family and the little that some organizations have been able to provide. It is, at times, very and extremely hard. There is a lot to remember, and each minute, each second, costs me. It costs me strength and energy, to maintain social skills, to remember how to do things, process information and formulate answers. It takes a lot of work, as I\u2019m sure most parents of autistic people can understand. \r\n \r\n The parent's claim to love her child, and value autistics, while telling autism to \"suck it\" has the same tone, and  the same inevitable failing , \u00a0as the \"hate the sin but love the sinner\" clich\u00e9. \u00a0 \r\n When a parent who has demonstrated a profound misunderstanding of neurodiversity writes, or says, that she wants to \"get rid of autism\" it's hard not to believe that the parent is thinking of getting rid of autistic  people . \u00a0I know how I would feel if somebody said that of me. \u00a0 \r\n Being \"intensely autistic\" -- extreme difficulty with communication, difficulty with sensory and emotional regulation, and so on-- is hard on the autistic person. \u00a0Parenting a child with intense autism is hard. \u00a0But there are many parents of intensely autistic individuals whose goals are not to \"get rid of autism\" but to help their children be \"at ease in their skin\" and to make the most of their gifts. \u00a0Note: not get rid of their autism. \u00a0It's not a subtle difference. \r\n Update: \r\n Melody Latimer , an autistic adult who has autistic children, has written  \"Why My Child Isn't Like Yours Isn't the Point\" . \r\n \r\n What I do know is that there is no amount of hate of Autism that will make your child better. There is no amount of vitriol put into treating your child that will not radiate to your child. There is nothing you can say that I have not been through myself, with one of my children, or have seen one of my friends go through. \r\n \r\n Robert Rummel Hudson, writing at Support for Special Needs, has written  No Offense , imagining a mythical conference where no one was allowed to express offense at another's words \r\n \r\n Now, of course, that\u2019s not strictly possible. Of course people would be offended; if the exchange of opinion were to flow freely, someone would be almost certain to find offense at something. But at this conference, no one would be allowed to stand up and say \u201cThat is offensive, the thing you just said!\u201d No one would be able to clothe themselves extravagantly in their their hurt feelings. If you didn\u2019t like what someone had to say, you would be free and in fact strongly encouraged to debate the merits of their position. But our conference\u2019s one rule would mean that standing on the marble platform of deep and personal offense would not be allowed. The first person to express outrage and offense would be booed out of the hall, and their box lunch privileges would be revoked. \r\n \r\n In a tweet, Carol Greenburg  @aspieadvocate   responded \u00a0to Robert Rummel Hudson's dream\u00a0(I've expanded the language beyond 140 characters). \r\n \r\n There is no offense-free zone possible, \u00a0because conflict is inevitable. Resolving it with compassion is hard work. None of us are excused from this work. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://joashline.com/2012/03/the-evolution-of-an-apology.html", "http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/erin-koteckivest/queenofspain", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035749336@N01/6014828992/", "http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/erin-koteckivest/queenofspain", "http://queenofspainblog.com/category/suckitlupus/", "http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081113093134AAI3Qwc", "http://www.blogher.com/my-personal-suckit-list?wrap=groups/suckit", "http://cbkingery.blogspot.com/2012/02/unexpected-guest.html", "http://bigfootchildhavediabetes.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/two-unawares/", "http://www.thehartleyhooligans.com/2012/02/2-can-suck-it.html", "http://cancercansuckit.blogspot.com/", "http://www.lovethatmax.com/2010/10/ad-campaign-for-kids-with-special-needs.html", "http://www.lovethatmax.com/p/about-me_09.html", "http://www.lovethatmax.com/", "http://www.lovethatmax.com/2010/10/ad-campaign-for-kids-with-special-needs.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2010/06/what-i-want-people-to-know.html", "http://www.affirmingtheology.com/love-the-sinner-hate-the-sin/", "http://www.asparenting.com/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2012/02/why-my-kid-isnt-like-yours-isnt-point.html", "http://supportforspecialneeds.com/2012/02/27/no-offense/", "https://twitter.com/#!/Aspieadvocate", "https://twitter.com/#!/Aspieadvocate/statuses/174690179548856320"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/02/condition-can-suckit.html", "title": "Condition Can #Suckit"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 21, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Day two's essay  is from Robert Rummel-Hudson, (book  Schuyler's Monster  blog  Fighting Monsters with Rubber Swords ).\u00a0 Rummel-Hudson came to disability advocacy through his school-aged daughter, who does not have autism but\u00a0 a  rare congenital brain malformation  that makes her essentially unable to use oral speech (in addition to other challenges). \r\n This series of conversations at  The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism  conversations came about, in part, because of an online disagreement between Robert and Zoe, over a  post  Robert wrote about making the use of the  R-word socially unacceptable. \u00a0\u00a0 the conversation didn't end well.\u00a0 \r\n Robert writes in part: \r\n \r\n So we're in this place now where parent advocates of kids with any  disability, not just autism, are told \"You're not one of us, you can't  understand our lives.\" And that exclusion might be appropriate  sometimes, but not all the time, and I don't think all that often. It's  not community, it's tribalism. And it's being wielded like a hammer,  inappropriately at times.    And I understand why, and I understand that no, the crux of the issues  we're writing about isn't parents, it's the person with the disability.  But there are gray areas here, like everything else in life.\u00a0 Dismissing  us because we are parent advocates is wrong, and it's not doing  anything at all to make anyone's lives any better. And when we make  mistakes, we are simultaneously kicked and bemoaned at for the lack of  dialogue or even listening. What that attitude towards us says is  not  \"You're making mistakes, you need to broaden your perspective, you need  to listen to people who can grow your advocacy in a productive way.\" It  says \"Go away, don't engage this community, this tribe, of  self-advocates. There's no dialogue here, only posturing and lecturing  and disregard.\"    So we have a choice: Retreat into our tribes, or find a way to diminish  our assumptions about each other. And that's hard, for everyone. When  we're offended, can we ask ourselves if the offense is intentional and  worthy of a bitter response? And if it's not, if our offense comes from a  place of ignorance, or from lack of perspective, or from things that we  assume to be true without digging further, can we look past our  emotions and our offense to find commonalities? \r\n \r\n As with the previous day, in addition to the author's thoughts, the value is in the comments.

Scroll donw \r\n \r\n Image description: a candle burning against a black background. Image source: By 4028mdk09 (Own work) [CC-BY-SA-3.0 (www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons \r\n On a rainy Friday night, March 16, 2012, about 25 people gathered to remember  George Hodgins and all disabled people killed by family members . \u00a0Zoe Gross's remarks are \u00a0reproduced below. \u00a0She had also prepared a list of disabled people murdered by family members, which we read aloud, one by one. \u00a0It was like the long tolling of a bell. \u00a0Then Zoe invited others to speak; these are the ones I remember and my frail memory of what they said: \u00a0 Kathryn Hedges \u00a0read a statement by  Kassiane Sibley ; distance prevented Kassiane from attending. ( Update 3/19/2012: Kassiane's remarks are reproduced below).\u00a0 Mark Romoser spoke about the value of all human life.\u00a0Landon Bryce's neurotypical friend spoke of how his perspective has been broadened, how much he has learned, by getting to know Landon. \u00a0Steve Silberman talked about the \"feebleminded\" and \"epileptics\" murdered by the Nazis in the T-4 program, many of which must have been autistic, who we then remembered. I spoke: I wondered if it was hard for George to have a mother who did not treasure his life. \r\n One of George's teachers from The Morgan Center remembered George, his ready smile, his engagement, his love of swimming and hiking, and that he is missed now and will continue to be missed. \r\n Around the country, those who couldn't attend the vigil light candles to honor George's full humanity and his life. \r\n Remarks by Zoe Gross, who organized the vigil  \r\n \r\n Last Tuesday, George Hodgins was shot and killed by his mother, who then killed herself. George lived here in Sunnyvale and he was 22 years old. I didn't know George, but I can't stop thinking about him. Maybe it's because we have a lot in common - we lived near each other, we were the same age, we're both autistic, although we led very different lives. I would like to have met George, but I can only mourn him. And I can try to make sure that his story isn't forgotten. \r\n In the wake of this tragedy, I read a lot of articles that asked the readers to imagine how George's mother must have felt. But I didn't see a single article that asked the reader to empathize for George, to imagine how it feels to see your mother point a gun at you. I've seen a lot of people talking about how hard it must be to live with an autistic relative, but I didn't see anyone talking about how terrible it be to die knowing that your parent, who you love and depend on, has decided to hurt and kill you. \r\n Because he was autistic, George is being erased from the story of his own murder. \r\n The story of George Hodgins's death is being discussed and presented as a story of a mother who snapped, and the story of other parents who have felt the same way. It's being told as a story about a lack of services for families with special-needs children, as though a lack of services is a justification for murder. \r\n When disabled people are murdered by their families, this is the story people want to hear. It's the same story that we saw in newspapers after Katie McCarron was murdered, and after Jeremy Fraser was murdered, and after Glenn Freaney was murdered, and after Zain and Faryaal Akhter were murdered. The story goes like this: it is understandable that someone would kill their disabled relative if they don't get help to care for them. \r\n I don't think this is a true story. \r\n Why is the story being told this way? Because we live in a world that doesn't acknowledge the value of our lives as disabled people. Because so many people in our society can't imagine a disabled person living a fulfilling life, so they don't see the tragedy and the wasted potential when one of our lives is cut short. \r\n As disabled people, we have to take a stand against this kind of thinking. We have to get the word out that our lives matter, tha tour lives are our own stories and not just the stories of our non-disabled parents and relatives and caretakers. We have to let people know that they are missing part of the story. \r\n Because the story of George Hodgins's murder is also the story of the disabled community losing one of our own. It's the story of the other disabled people who were murdered by their family members, and it's the story of the society that thinks so little of people with disabilities that these murders are all too often justified as \"understandable.\" Most of all, it's George's story - the story of a young man who enjoyed hiking, who was always looking to learn new skills, who had his whole life in front of him. \r\n Now George is gone, and only his memory remains, and already that memory is being distorted by people who want to tell his story and leave him out. That's not going to happen tonight. We're here to remember the real story. \r\n \r\n Kassiane Sibley has kindly given me permission to reproduce her remarks, which are also posted at her blog, Radical Neurodivergence at  The Words Said for George \r\n \r\n I hate writing for murdered people. It does no good. They're still dead, and people always try to make what I say all about themselves & then they get all mad and hateful at me. But it isn't about them. And it isn't about me, either. It's about the person who is dead but shouldn't be. \r\n This time, it's about George, a pleasant 22 year old man who will never see 23. Before George, it was Katie. It was Christopher. It was Ulysses. It was 100s of autistics before them, know and unknown to me. \r\n These murders are  not mercy killings. They are murders, and I am 100% confident in saying that no parent who truly loves their child can kill them. Love does not work that way. \r\n Those of you who are not autistic may be inclined to sympathize with George's murderer. Maybe what you know about autism is tragedy-and-terror style awareness, all about devastation and loss. Maybe you know her, maybe you liked her. Maybe she was your neighbour. Maybe you can't wrap your head around the reality that you had coffee with a murderer. Maybe trying to find mitigating factors makes it easier to integrate that you know someone who killed her son. \r\n Those of you who are autistic are probably feeling more like what I feel-saddened that yet another of our number was killed. Maybe, like me, you are disgusted at the race to exonerate the murderer in the media. And, if you are like me, you are terrified that everyone is blaming lack of services, stress, everything but \u201cHIS MOTHER SHOT HIM\u201d for George's death. \r\n I hate writing for murdered people. Again and again and again I have to defend the very right of the victim to be treated as a human being in all reports, for his very personhood and the personhood of myself and those I hold dear. This stuff shouldn't need saying. My outrage should be the norm, not the exception. \r\n The tragedy here is not autism. The tragedy here is that George, like countless autistics before him, was murdered. The tragedy is that people feel more for his killer than they do for him. \r\n \r\n Steve Silberman kindly photographed the vigil; the photographs can be seen at  https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151401301460313.815702.830415312&type=3 \r\n CBS Channel 5 in San Francisco covered the vigil:   http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/video/6851186-memorial-held-for-autistic-sunnyvale-man-killed/  \r\n  Zoe Gross and the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network are organizing further vigils scheduled for March 30, 2012 . \r\n \r\n On behalf of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, I am asking you join us in taking action. On March 30th, help us organize a nation-wide day of mourning for disabled people killed by family members and caregivers. Our goal is to hold vigils in cities across America to memorialize murder victims. Through your help, we hope to amplify our message: that disabled people deserve to live fulfilling lives free of violence \r\n We're calling for volunteers to organize vigils in their local communities on or around March 30th. You may never have organized this kind of event before, but please know that you'll have support - our first vigil was a success, and we can help you as you work to organize yours. If you want to help us take a stand against the violence facing our community, please write to me at zgross@autisticadvocacy.org. \r\n Send a message to society that the disability community has no place for the kind of \"mercy\" offered by Robert Latimer and others who view us as having lives not worth living. The time has come for us to fight back. On March 30th, help us make it happen. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AEinzelne_Kerze.JPG", "http://www.facebook.com/events/199680943470301/203410299764032/", "http://khedges.wordpress.com/", "http://timetolisten.blogspot.com/", "http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?llr=sdpblmeab&v=001AYtQarwRIsCjXob6dRt3OiaHtwPK3LUqxVrvpvhoiJQIQRmaH2rbA7UA9udpaPo9KyLE9FrGDAmcUCUgm1dbseg3j3veVZrx0Et3Z28BmSSyVk6Olvwedg%3D%3D", "http://timetolisten.blogspot.com/2012/03/words-said-for-george.html", "https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151401301460313.815702.830415312&type=3", "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/video/6851186-memorial-held-for-autistic-sunnyvale-man-killed/", "http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?llr=sdpblmeab&v=001VZO97oWchjDtd2hidRjJ2xJyVi6z-USQjHsqS8Zfnfk-u0CHn20gpAmgIubeX6UWq-oFXHYSrETgQ_dnspk95KmBgSOPRuMJHY5fWZet7BU%3D"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/03/vigil-for-george-hodgins-and-other-disabled-people-murdered-by-their-families.html", "title": "Vigil for George Hodgins and other disabled people murdered by their families"},
{"date": "Sunday, April 01, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t It's the tired, sad old  story \u00a0lie that parents seek diagnoses for the gravy-train of benefits and living large at public expense. As  ebohlman  wrote  last year \r\n \r\n Rush Limbaugh has done more than anyone else to promote the notion that childhood disabilities are primarily a tool for parents to collect welfare benefits. It\u2019s a total staple of right-wing talk radio (along with the notion that most childhood disabilities are the result of mothers using illegal drugs). \r\n \r\n One of Orac's regular commenters, who is a dauntless woo-fighter,  really disappointed me with this comment: \r\n \r\n Being labeled as handicapped, can also make the child eligible for SSI and Medicaid. There is also a quirk in the Social Security Law, that permits a parent who has paid into Social Security for 40 quarters (10 years), to claim Social Security Disability for themselves...based on caring for a disabled child. There are many ways to game the system, if one is so inclined and, this might be a factor in the increased incidence of autism, in some instances. \r\n \r\n I responded with: lilady, while I admire you, this comment is offensive to autistics and to autism parents. It was offensive when Allen Frances made the same claim [see  Sharon at the Awful Truth ,  Emily at A Life Less Ordinary , and  Sarah at Kitsaika Sandwich ] \u00a0and it was offensive when Sue Basko made the claim [ Sullivan at Leftbrain/Rightbrain  and  my blog here  and  here  . There's not a shred of evidence that parents are seeking an autism diagnosis to game the system, and a great deal of evidence that many kids aren't getting needed early intervention services. \r\n Jon Brock, an autism researcher, on  autism and intellectual disability: \r\n \r\n As we saw last time, a good chunk of the kids failed to meet DSM-5 criteria for ASD. However, kids with intellectual disability were much more likely to be diagnosed with ASD than were those with IQs above 70. This is the opposite of what we\u2019d expect if DSM-5 really was going to selectively exclude the intellectually disabled. \r\n \r\n In another article, Brock discussed  Pervasive Developmental Delay - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) and the DSM-5 , particularly the requirement that to be classified as autistic, a person must exhibit both social/language difficulties andrepetitive and stereotyped behaviors (RSBs) \r\n \r\n There is certainly a case to be made that children are being over-diagnosed and that the boundaries for autism-related disorders should be brought in. However, there is also a real danger that individuals with severe social and communication difficulties would be excluded from support and interventions designed to improve their social and communication skills. All because they don\u2019t also have RSBs. \r\n \r\n He also discusses the new-with-DSM-5 disorder,  Social Communication Disorder (SCD): \r\n \r\n Effectively, SCD seems to be official recognition for what researchers and practitioners have previously referred to as \"Pragmatic Language Impairment\" rather than a replacement for PDD-NOS. The emphasis is very much on the communication side of things, particularly conversation skills, with a suggestion that social difficulties are a secondary consequence of impaired communication. That's my interpretation at least. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://turnipsandpotatoes.wordpress.com/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/12/ignorance-adds-to-stigma-again/#comment-280693", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2012/03/the_antivaccine_movement_resurrects_the.php#comment-6251254", "http://sharon-theawfultruth.blogspot.com/2011/07/how-to-solve-problem-like-allen-francis.html", "http://daisymayfattypants.blogspot.com/2010/12/nprs-aspergers-fail.html", "http://www.kitaiskasandwich.com/2010/12/30/allen-frances-gave-us-the-aspergers-epidemic-just-like-al-gore-gave-us-the-internet/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/12/ignorance-adds-to-stigma-again/", "http://crackingtheenigma.blogspot.com/2012/03/autism-and-intellectual-disability-in.html", "http://crackingtheenigma.blogspot.com/2011/05/what-is-pdd-nos.html", "http://crackingtheenigma.blogspot.com/2011/06/social-communication-disorder-new.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/04/ignorance-adds-to-stigma-round-6023.html", "title": "Ignorance adds to Stigma, Round #6,023: The Autism Gravy-Train"},
{"date": "Friday, September 23, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thursday's post is Zoe's reply to Rober t, which reads in part: \r\n \r\n .....you were adamant that parents have a place in the disability rights movement. I want to begin by letting you know that we are in vehement agreement on this point: in terms of advocating for the rights of disabled people, I absolutely think that non-disabled parents and relatives have an important role to play. \r\n As commenters this week have been pointing out, this role is a complicated one. Among parents, advocacy is occurring on two levels: parents advocating for their children individually, and parents becoming involved in disability rights generally. Because you refer to yourself as a disability advocate as well as an advocate for Schuyler, I can see that you consider both types of advocacy to be central to your work. \r\n As a parent, you are familiar with your child\u2019s needs. Your description of the role of a shepherd as a guide and protector is a moving depiction of the way you relate to Schuyler as a parent -- and, I think, the way parents relate to their children generally. I admire your efforts to guide and protect Schuyler, and I have no wish to tell you what to do on that front. \r\n When it comes to broader disability rights advocacy, however, working cooperatively with disabled people becomes part of your role. The shepherd analogy is touching when describing parental care, but it is less appropriate as a model for a relationship between political allies. The problem is not only with this imperfect metaphor, but with the attitude towards disabled activists that the metaphor reveals.... \r\n \r\n I have some concerns from you letter that I\u2019d like to address. \r\n Go read the whole thing .\u00a0 And the comments.\u00a0 Always the comments -- which are also deep, rich, and challenging. \r\n \r\n Link to the whole series \r\n Day One:  Zoe of Illusion of Competence to Robert Rummel-Hudson  \r\n Day Two:  Robert Rummel-Hudson to Zoe \r\n Day Three:  Ari Ne'eman of Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN)  \r\n Day Four:  Zoe of Illusion of Competence \r\n Day Five:  Robert Rummel-Hudson< /li>  \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-four.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-four.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/search/label/dialogue", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-one.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-two.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-three.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-four.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/09/self-advocateparent-dialogues-day-five.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/09/difficult-but-essential-conversations-day-four.html", "title": "Difficult but essential conversations Adults with disability talking with parents of disabled children: Day Four: Zoe"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 14, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Updated to add: I am a taxpayer in the Redwood City School District. \u00a0All \u00a0of my children are adults; none were educated in the Redwood City School District. \u00a0 \r\n Update, 3/15/2012: I have added District Superintendent Jan Christensn's comments from the article in blue italics. \u00a0My summary of the issues is in red italics is at the bottom of the piece. \r\n Update, 3/15/2012 at 4 pm: I have added additional information from the District. \r\n \u00a0 This morning,  our local Patch  ran the following piece,  Why I Filed a Child Abuse Report Against a Special Ed Aide . \u00a0In my view, Redwood City Patch failed in its duty to the community by publishing this piece. \u00a0I detail my reasons below. \r\n If you don't know what Patch is, or don't live in communities served by the Patch empire, here's a sketch: \r\n \r\n What is Patch? \r\n Simply put, Patch is a new way to find out about, and participate in, what\u2019s going on near you. \r\n We\u2019re a community-specific news and information platform dedicated to providing comprehensive and trusted local coverage for individual towns and communities. \r\n \r\n I live in one of the California communities served by Patch (we also have several print media news organs). \u00a0For the purposes of understanding the issues, there are four things you need to know about our local school district: \r\n \r\n Our district's budget has been cut to the bone over the last four years. \u00a0Enrollment has increased by 13% while the budget has decreased by 20%. The district was far from wealthy in 2007; but for every per-student dollar in 2007, the budget now has about \u00a0$0.70 to spend. \u00a0These catastrophic cuts come to a district that is  48% English language learners\u00a0and 64% on free or reduced-price meals . \r\n Our district in the midst of a  very high-profile  special education abuse case, unrelated to the opinion piece printed today. \u00a0In that case,\u00a0 a special-education preschool teacher was recently charged with abusing two pre-schoolers in her classroom. \u00a0As a matter of legal obligation,  eight teachers and adminstrators were placed on paid administrative leave  while an independent investigation was undertaken. \u00a0 Note that the employees were put on leave before any legal hearing for the accused teacher had taken place. \u00a0 \u00a0At a school board meeting,  special education parents testified about the dedication and professionalism of three of the eight employees on leave. \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n The whole case has caused deeply emotional divisions in the community: between parents of children in general education and those in special education; between parents of children in special education, and among community members who are taxpayers in the community but do not have children in the district. \r\n \r\n On February 4, 2012, Patch ran an article,  Special Education Teacher Arrested For Child Endangerment. \u00a0 \r\n On Feb 8, Patch employees, using the photograph of the accused, but not yet tried, teacher, flatly asserted that the accused teacher\u00a0\"slapped a student, twisted a student\u2019s wrist and was charged with other allegations\"\u00a0and\u00a0invited the public to speculate on  \"What Constitutes Teacher Abuse ?\"\u00a0 \r\n Why did the Patch do this, other than to boost readership? \u00a0 \r\n On March 13, 2012, Dorie Johnson  posted several comments to the February 4, 2012 and the February 8\u00a0articles. \u00a0  Update: Stacie Chan interviewed Johnson after the close of business on March 13, and asked the district via email for clarification, again after the close of business. \r\n By 5:50 am, March 14, 2012, the Patch editor Stacie Chan had posted a highly inaccurate and inflammatory under her by-line, \u00a0with \u00a0by Dorie Johnson, \"as told to Stacie Chan.\" Chan wrote:\u00a0 The Redwood City School District was not available for immediate comment, so Patch will be providing updates throughout the story as they become available. \u00a0 \r\n Is that fair and balanced journalism? \u00a0I don't think so. \u00a0The Society of Professional Journalists' Code of Ethics states, \r\n \r\n Test the accuracy of information from all sources and exercise care to avoid inadvertent error. Deliberate distortion is never permissible. \r\n Diligently seek out subjects of news stories to give them the opportunity to respond to allegations of wrongdoing. \r\n \r\n In other words, Chan accepted Johnson's accounts as true, without any balance from district. \u00a0This is hardly \"comprehensive and trusted local coverage\". \u00a0It's Chan on a vendetta against the district, for reasons I yet to comprehend. \u00a0 \r\n There are other issues that Chan did not reveal. \r\n On January 3, 2009, Dorie Johnson's 15-year-old son Matthew was out on an overpass \u00a0at 1 am in the morning, throwing rocks and bottles at cars passing by underneath. \u00a0His missiles hit a car,  the teen-aged occupants of which chased him down and fatally stabbed him . \u00a0The murderer wasn't apprehended for a year; the murder trial  began November 29, 2011 ; the accused  was found guilty of second-degree murder  on December 16, 2011. \u00a0According to the  Facebook Memorial Page for Matthew Johnson,  the family did not know until March 2, 2012 when the murderer will be sentenced. The sentencing will be heard \u00a0April 20, 2012. \r\n So Dorie Johnson's life has hardly been tranquil or stress-free in the last three years, with the extreme stress of the trial just before the holidays. \r\n According to the \"as told to Chan\" article, \u00a0Dorie Johnson worked for the Redwood City School District (RCSD) from\u00a01998 and 2007, in administrative tasks, without much direct student contact. \u00a0 \u00a0 She went back to work for the district on\u00a0February 10, 2012. According to Johnson, she is employed as a \"special education teacher\u2019s assistant\". \u00a0 Based on  postings at the district office , she may have been either a  permanent or substitute instructional assistant for special education . \u00a0I assume by the itinerant schedule she had that she was a substitute IA, or aide. \u00a0The qualifications are quite low: \u00a0applicants must have a\u00a0High School Diploma/GED, and must pass district proficiency test by at least 70%. \u00a0Johnson wrote,\u00a0\"I had no formal special education training from the district\". \u00a0This isn't unusual; it's not unique to the Redwood City School District. \u00a0 \r\n Let's put the dates in context, which Chan should have done. \u00a0Johnson started work 8 weeks after the conclusion of the trial for her son's murderer, with the date of his sentencing still in limbo. \u00a0The news of the teacher's arrest broke Saturday, February 4, 2012. \u00a0Six days later, Johnson started work. \u00a0According\u00a0to the \"as told to Chan\" article, \u00a0Johnson started work on a Friday, and \"worked three days\" at school #1, \u00a0then school #2, then moved to school #3 on February 15. \u00a0The dates don't work out. \u00a0There were only four school days between Johnson's reported start date and February 15. \u00a0 \r\n School #3 is the same campus (but not the same educational program) where the pre-school abuse case. \u00a0At that time, the campus was besieged at least twice by TV reporters with their trucks and hoards of reporters, seeking news (it was a slow news cycle).\u00a0 \r\n At school #3, this inexperienced aide was assigned to a classroom where the long-term teacher had left the Friday before for maternity leave. \u00a0In the\u00a0\"as told to Chan\" article, Johnson revealed enough information that I was easily able to find the classroom webpage on the school's website. \u00a0 Why did Chan allow this information to be published? \r\n For the next seven paragraphs, Johnson discusses children's behavior and what she observed about the behavior of other aides, both of which disturbed her. \u00a0There are only \"seven or eight\" children in the classroom; the children are thus easily identifiable. \u00a0 \r\n Johnson wrote, \r\n \r\n \u00a0...On Feb. 21, Student 2 was sitting by himself humming in a back and forth motion waiting to come to circle time. Rather than gently asking him to stop, the aide was yelling at him by name saying \u201cQUIET. BE QUIET.\u201dThe substitute teacher was sitting there the whole time not even bothered by the tone of her voice. \r\n Every aide has their own child to manage, so, in the most generous terms, it\u2019s possible they didn\u2019t witness this behavior. But the substitute teacher would sit at his desk the entire time and never intervene. \r\n \r\n Johnson met with the school principal on March 5, and reported the conversation as follows, \"She told me she had heard about my concerns from other aides and asked me if she should call Child Protective Services. \" \u00a0 Why did Chan publish this alleged conversation without verifying it with the principal?\u00a0 \r\n Johnson then went on to write about an alleged conversation with the district's behavioral psychologist 1 , which from the gist of the article, must have occured on March 5. \u00a0 There's only one  ,  The district has only one behavioral psychologist,\u00a0 and as of February 10, (as I understand it), \u00a0he was one of eight district employees placed on paid administrative leave. \u00a0He was  still on leave as of February 23, 2012. \u00a0  The earliest he returned to work was Thursday, March 1 . \u00a0 Updated: the behavioral psychologist returned to work Monday, February 27. \u00a0From the 27th to approximately the 1st, he was engaged in off-campus work for special-education students who are in out-of-district placements. \u00a0March 5 was one of the first days he was on-site in the district. \r\n \r\n I then went to the district\u2019s behavioral psychologist to explain what I had witnessed over the past couple of weeks. I got the attitude from him as if he were saying \u201ctell your little story and we\u2019ll be done with you.\u201d He never probed for further details or asked more about the aide\u2019s behavior.\u00a0\u201cThe guidelines are stressful,\u201d he explained, as if that excused her actions.\u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n I then asked him what the guidelines were for restraining children. Only if they are a danger to themselves or trying to injure others, he said . \r\n \r\n Why did Chan publish this alleged conversation without verifying it with the behavioral psychologist? \u00a0Why didn't Chan find out what the context of this conversation was -- Was this a formal meeting, or did Johnson grab the behavioral psychologist in passing? \u00a0Was he between appointments in the hallway? \u00a0 \r\n \r\n Superintendent Christiansen wrote:  the substitute left campus without permission during duty hours and drove to the district office, where she had an unscheduled meeting with our behavioral psychologist. \u00a0The substitute asked the psychologist general questions about behavioral intervention in a crisis, and he provided her with information about appropriate applied behavioral analysis (ABA) techniques for dealing with students who have special behavioral needs. \u00a0ABA techniques are used to keep children safe and never to punish students.  \r\n \r\n Johnson went on to write,\u00a0 \r\n \r\n In my head, I recalled the few times when I had to restrain some children, when they were acting out and even scratched me, causing my arm to bleed. \u00a0But I locked their arms and legs until I could feel their body loosen, then released them while calmly telling them to \u201cStop. Stop.\u201d \r\n \r\n Why didn't Chan clarify when this happen, in the 2012 classrooms Johnson was assigned to, or when her own children were younger? \u00a0If in the 2012 classrooms, what Johnson described is called \"a basket hold\" and is highly questionable for an unskilled person to do. Of course, if it were her own children, that's a different matter. \r\n Johnson continued, \r\n \r\n The following day, March 6, I returned to the school to find out that they had removed me from Room XX \r\n \r\n Here Chan has allowed Johnson to identify not only the school, but the exact classroom. \u00a0This is surely an invasion of the students' privacy. \u00a0 \r\n I was able to find a blog posting about the class with the substitute teacher's name and identifying information, the children's first names, and the classroom aides first names, all in about 43 seconds. This is certainly also an invasion of the substitute teacher's privacy, as Chan allows Johnson to make serious allegations about the sub's ability to conduct himself and the classroom in a professional manner. \r\n On sometime on or after March 6, Johnson made a telephone report to Child Protective Services (CPS) about the conditions she had observed in the classroom, and about the behavior of one particular aide. \u00a0 \r\n \r\n On March 9, I called the Superintendent. Her secretary told me that she\u2019d call me back and was available March 19. Eleven days after I had called to report a very serious matter. \r\n \r\n This is \"as told to\" piece. \u00a0Why didn't Chan verify when Johnson called CPS? \u00a0If Johnson called CPS on the 6th, why didn't Chan find out why Johnson waited until the 9th to call the Superintendent's office? \u00a0What did Johnson say to the Superintendent's secretary? \u00a0Did Johnson say that she'd reported abuse, or just wanted a meeting? \u00a0Chan doesn't say. \r\n \r\n Superintendent Christiansen wrote: \u00a0 The next morning, the substitute contacted CPS to make a report. \u00a0 As is standard practice in such cases, we placed the instructional aide whose behavior was in question on administrative leave so that we could conduct an internal review.\u00a0 \r\n The internal review determined that the substitute\u2019s allegations of child abuse were unfounded. The review showed that the incident in question occurred when a dangerous situation arose in the classroom. \u00a0Keeping all students in the classroom safe was the top priority. The review showed that in order to protect a student from hurting self and others, the instructional aide responded with appropriate (ABA) techniques.  \r\n Once an incident is reported to a child protective agency, it is up to that agency to respond appropriately. \u00a0Based on the report filed, CPS determines when and if an incident is investigated and whether it is turned over to law enforcement. \u00a0Since the incident was reported to CPS on March 6, no one has followed up on the complaint with any further investigation. \r\n \r\n Update March 15, 2012 at 4 pm: I have received further information from the District. \u00a0The internal review was completed March 9. Of course,\u00a0anytime additional information is obtained the district can and should review the findings from the previous investigation, to determine if the District should \u00a0take additional action. \u00a0 Presumably the aide returned to work on March 12. \u00a0I wonder if the aide's return to work is what caused Dorie Johnson to make her unsubstantiated claims? \r\n I started writing this blog post at about 2 pm March 14, 2012. \u00a0I didn't return to the article until 9:40 pm, and looked through the comments. \u00a0  At  approximately 5 pm  \u00a03:41 pm, Stacie Chan posted in the comments:\u00a0 \r\n \r\n To clarify, the reason I wrote \"The District was not available for an *immediate* comment\" was that I had sent an email after hours at 6:15pm Tuesday night. (This was as soon as I got off the phone with Dorie Johnson.) It was unreasonable to expect a response that late in the day, which is why I said I would do a follow-up with the district's response. \r\n The reason I decided to run this story immediately was that there had already been comments made by Dorie on another Patch article about this very serious issue. I felt it was more important to clarify her remarks then let them sit in an open forum. \r\n The district has always given me information and a response when I've requested it. We have always had a very understanding relationship, and I appreciate its efforts to give whatever information they can. I knew I only needed to send an email and they would get back to me as soon as possible. They have already been in contact with me and more information will be available shortly. \r\n \r\n This is simply not an acceptable reason to post unverified, serious allegations. There was no reason for Stacie Chan to hold the \"as told to\" piece for 24 hours, to allow the district to respond. \r\n I can only conclude that Stacie Chan is more interested \u00a0in using sensationalism to build Patch readership than in accurately representing what is happening in Redwood City Schools. \r\n Summary:  On March 1, Dorie Johnson witnessed an aide's behavior that she, Ms. Johnson, thought was abusive. \u00a0On March 6, Ms. Johnson reported the aide to Child Protective Services. That day, or the next, the district put aide in question on administrative leave, and began an internal investigation. \u00a0Once CPS is invoked, there are legal and procedural limit on what the District can and should do. \u00a0Those procedures were followed. The child was not at risk. \u00a0There was no pressing need for the Superintendent to meet with Ms. Johnson, as the child's safety was being insured by the required procedures. \u00a0The fact that Ms. Johnson was vexed by the Superintendent's scheduling of a meeting some time later has nothing to do with the child's safety. \u00a0The internal review found that the behavior that \u00a0appropriate Applied Behavioral Analysis procedures were followed.  \r\n My opinion: The Patch behaved irresponsibly and unprofessionally in publising Johnson's piece. The Patch continued to behave irresponsibly by allowing commenters on the piece, including Johnson, to name and shame district employees, who were following the legal mandates of their respective positions. \r\n Unanswered questions: \r\n \r\n Why didn't \u00a0Stacie Chan wait 24 hours to get the District's side of this story? \r\n Why did Stacie Chan publish information that allowed the identification of the classroom, the students, the substitute teacher, and the aides? \r\n When did Dorie Johnson place students in basket holds? \u00a0Was it in 2012 or earlier, before she was employed by the District? \r\n Why did the Patch allow Johnson and others to name names in the comments? \r\n \r\n The opinions on this blog are my own, and in no way represent the many groups, foundations and communities with whom my name may be associated.\u00a0 \r\n 1  I know the district's behavioral psychologist socially. He has never provided services to any of my children. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://redwoodcity.patch.com/", "http://redwoodcity.patch.com/articles/why-i-filed-a-special-ed-abuse-report-against-an-aide", "http://www.patch.com/about", "http://www.ed-data.k12.ca.us/App_Resx/EdDataClassic/fsTwoPanel.aspx?#!bottom=/_layouts/EdDataClassic/profile.asp?Tab=1&level=06&reportnumber=16&county=41&district=69005#englishlearners", "https://www.google.com/search?aq=f&ix=ucb&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=patch#hl=en&sclient=psy-ab&q=%22redwood+city%22+%22school+district%22+%22abuse%22&oq=%22redwood+city%22+%22school+district%22+%22abuse%22&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=761753l766207l5l766419l8l8l0l0l0l1l234l992l3.4.1l8l0&gs_l=serp.3...761753l766207l5l766419l8l8l0l0l0l1l234l992l3j4j1l8l0.frgbld&psj=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=6b8f6c2ef22f8dde&biw=1022&bih=603", "http://www.mercurynews.com/san-mateo-county-times/ci_19932991", "http://redwoodcity.patch.com/articles/community-pleads-with-district-to-not-fire-3-special-ed-staff", "http://redwoodcity.patch.com/articles/roosevelt-special-ed-teacher-arrested-for-child-endangerment", "http://redwoodcity.patch.com/articles/question-what-constitutes-teacher-abuse-860b50a3", "http://redwoodcity.patch.com/users/dorie-johnson", "http://redwoodcity.patch.com/articles/trial-begins-for-alleged-sequoia-student-killer", "http://redwoodcity.patch.com/articles/trial-begins-for-alleged-sequoia-student-killer", "http://redwoodcity.patch.com/articles/man-charged-with-murder-of-sequoia-student", "http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=340372616000932&id=135060983198764", "http://www.rcsd.k12.ca.us/Page/174", "http://www.rcsd.k12.ca.us/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&ModuleInstanceID=2084&ViewID=C9E0416E-F0E7-4626-AA7B-C14D59F72F85&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=3972&PageID=174", "http://redwoodcity.patch.com/articles/community-pleads-with-district-to-not-fire-3-special-ed-staff", "http://redwoodcity.patch.com/articles/substitute-s-allegations-of-child-abuse-are-unfounded", "http://redwoodcity.patch.com/articles/substitute-s-allegations-of-child-abuse-are-unfounded", "http://redwoodcity.patch.com/articles/why-i-filed-a-special-ed-abuse-report-against-an-aide#comment_2749125"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/03/should-our-local-patch-have-published-this-article.html", "title": "Should Our Local Patch Have Published This Article?

{"date": "Friday, September 23, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Friday's post is Robert Rummel-Hudson's reply \r\n From the introduction to the series: \r\n \r\n Because it needs to happen. Because being a parent of a disabled child is not the same experience as having a disability, and we need to figure out how we can have productive conversations about that disconnect -- especially when it affects our ability to work towards common goals. Building constructive conversations and creating real social change isn't a garden party -- it is hard work. It requires steely listening, forcing ourselves to bench purely defensive reactions, and honestly trying to understand unfamiliar perspectives and direct criticism.  \r\n \r\n Robert begins his essay: \r\n \r\n The world is watching us.    The world is watching as many parent-advocates and disability  self-advocates fail to hear each other, fail to validate each other's  very real work and very powerful experiences, fail to recognize the life  pieces we share, fail to build on those commonalities.    The world is watching as some of our communities become tribes, as  healthy debate on issues like vaccines, cures, inclusion, cochlear  implants, privilege, and language turn into fights.\u00a0 The world is  watching as we feed on each other.    The world is watching, but the world isn't seeing our commonalities. And  much of the world is more than happy to deny us a place at the table of  human dignity. To the world, we probably look happy enough fighting  over the scraps from that table. We're certainly busy doing so.    Building communities is hard work. It's hard because our commonalities  are deteriorated by the things that divide us, certainly, but they are  also eroded by the thing that we all really do have in common: our  humanity. Our human failures, our egos, our fear of the unknown, our  inability to view the world from another perspective. We're not  characters in a movie. We don't represent specific archetypes that never  change or grow. Like everyone else, parent-advocates and disability  self-advocates are evolving. But evolution is slow, it's uneven and  probably not much fun to watch. \r\n \r\n Read the whole post.

{"date": "Monday, April 02, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t A version was previously posted  here \r\n \u00a0 On March 29, 2012,  Louise Kuo Habakus  spoke at a  local bookstore, presenting on the \"findings\"  from the book she  co-edited with Mary Holland . \u00a0I went with  Shannon Rosa  and  Jennifer Byde Myers . \u00a0The presentation was scheduled for two hours; we left in disgust after 40 minutes. \r\n Some of the highlights from Habakus's talk: \r\n \r\n Did you know that  Louise Kuo Habakus  is an expert on data analysis from her years on Wall Street, and she knows you \"can take data and make it say anything you want it to say\" so \"all corporate studies are suspect\"? \r\n \r\n That's a pretty slick little piece of  poisoning the well . \u00a0The  dozens of studies with hundreds of thousands of subjects  that have failed to find a connection between autism and vaccines are \"all corporate studies\".\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Did you know that there are \"a lot of credentialed professionals who question vaccine safety\"? \r\n \r\n Here Habakus is referring to the contributors to her book. \u00a0There are a mort of attorneys; the health professions are represented by \u00a0 Sherri Tenpenny ,  Andrew Wakefield ,  Carol Stott ,  Judy Converse ,  Vera Hassner Sharav ,  Sonja Hintz ,  Twila Brase , and\u00a0 Gay Tate . \u00a0I think we need a  \"Project Steve\" \u00a0 for physicians and scientists who support and advance vaccination, immunology, and prevent infectious disease. Maybe we could call it Project Paul. \r\n \r\n Did you know it is common for people who use non-allopathic methods to heal their children's vaccine injuries to be reported to Child Protective Services and have their children taken away? \r\n \r\n This scare tactic has to do with the so-called \" Arizona Five \". \u00a0The court recently  heard the case  and found that, contrary to parents' beliefs and actions, all 5 children are healthy and non-autistic. \u00a0Having one's children removed by CPS for using alternative medicine \u00a0is probably rare. \u00a0I am sure we would hear about more stories if they existed, given how noisy vaccine-rejectionist are. \r\n \r\n Did you know that \"rotavirus is not deadly in the United States\"? \r\n \r\n Oh whoops. \u00a0That is a big whopper. \u00a0 From the CDC pre-vaccine: \r\n \"In the first 5 years of life, four out of five children in the United States will develop rotavirus diarrhea; one in seven will require a clinic or emergency room visit; one in 78 will require hospitalization; and one in 200,000 will die from rotavirus diarrhea. The risk for rotavirus diarrhea and its outcomes do not appear to vary by geographic region within the United States.\" \r\n \r\n Did you know that \"50% of the children are chronically ill\" and these illnesses are linked to the \"bloated vaccine schedule\"? \r\n \r\n In this segment of the talk Habakus went over the  dreaded 1-in-6 statistic  and added in asthma, diabetes (type not specified), food allergies, and obesity. \u00a0The very next slide showed the increase in vaccines given from 1983 to the present, and Habakus looked out at the audience and said something like, \"do you think it's a coincindence?\" \u00a0Grr. \u00a0Of course she didn't talk about the decrease in  morbidity and mortality that the \"bloated\" vaccine schedule affords children  -- and their families. \u00a0Nor did she mention that since the number of antigens in vaccines given today is only about 4% of \u00a0what I child would have received in the 1980s. \r\n \r\n Source: Offit et al. (2002) Addressing Parents\u2019 Concerns: Do Multiple Vaccines Overwhelm or Weaken the Infant\u2019s Immune System?  Pediatrics \u00a0\u00a02002;109;124-129\u00a0 DOI: 10.1542/peds.109.1.124\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0& click to embiggen. \r\n \r\n Did you know that the \"Vaccine Court\" rejected the claims of the 5,000 families claiming autism as vaccine injury and nobody bothered to study the children who were injured. \r\n \r\n This  non sequitur\u00a0 had me shaking my head. \u00a0The  Omnibus Cases  were the best shot the \"autism is vaccine injury\" camp had to make their case, and they failed dismally. \u00a0The only thing the 5,000 (or so) had in common was: recruited by vaccine injury lawyers and/or a belief that their child's autism was caused by vaccines. \u00a0Why would those children be  more  appropriate to study than the children in this study or this study or this study? \r\n \r\n Did you know there's still thimerosal in vaccines? Yes there is, because it is used in the manufacture of vaccines (to disinfect the disgusting vats of soupy growth media) and it is so neurotoxic that even 2 parts per billion can kill brain cells. Mercury is \"so toxic that it shouldn't be used at all\"? \r\n \r\n What part of  thimerosal doesn't cause autism  is so hard to accept? \u00a0What part of \" the dose makes the poison\"  is so hard to understand?\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Did you know that Tylenol is a potent hepatoxin? So if you give Tylenol to an infant after vaccination, the liver is all busy detoxifying the Tylenol so all the nasty toxins in the vaccines aren't filtered. \r\n \r\n This is a gross paraphrase of what Habakus said. \u00a0It was something about Tylenol (acetaminophen) \"using up\" all the liver's stores of glutathione, so that the \"toxins\" in vaccines are able to damage the brain and the body. \u00a0There's Whale.to page on acetaminophen and glutathione, and a report on  acetaminophen poisoning \u00a0using glutatione as therapy.\u00a0\u00a0 Acetaminophen, MMR, and autism study discussed here ; note the study was published in 2008 and has not been repeated.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Did you know that Paul Offit is paid by the vaccine companies to spend all his time going around promoting vaccines? \r\n \r\n A random, ad hominem attack on  Paul Offit . \u00a0It really does seem that to anti-vaccinationists, he is a  myffic figure of dread \r\n \r\n Did you know that studies proving that the HepB vaccine causes autistic-like changes in infant macaque brains was suppressed by the vaccine industry? \r\n \r\n I had a hard time suppressing my double eyeball-roll on this one. \u00a0There was \u00a0the infamous Hewiston macaque study ,\u00a0 Delayed acquisition of neonatal reflexes in newborn primates receiving a thimerosal-containing Hepatitis B vaccine: Influence of gestational age and birth weight , (Hewitson et al. 2009) which was withdrawn before publication. \u00a0Before it was withdrawn, \u00a0David Gorski MD  eviscerated the paper \u00a0on October 8, 2009. \u00a0 Life sciences professor Prometheus wrote on October 24, 2009 \u00a0that it was a  paper designed for litigation \u00a0and \"This study raises more red flags than a Kremlin\u00a0May Day parade\u00a0in the old Soviet Union. \" The study, however, got a lot of play by the \"autism is vaccine injury\" camp. On \u00a0February 11 2010 Orac returned to discussing the study, in  \"Show me the monkeys ,\" but then notices  the paper was withdrawn , as Prometheus  discusses. \u00a0 In July 2012 Sullivan reported that  Hewitson left her academic appointment. \r\n The other two studies,\u00a0 Hepatitis B Vaccination Of Male Neonates And Autism Diagnosis,  NHIS 1997\u20132002 (Gallagher & Goodman 2010 \u00a0J Toxicol EnvironHealth A. 2010;73(24):1665-77) \u00a0and  Hepatitis B Triple Series Vaccine and Developmental Disability in US children aged 1-9 years  (Gallagher & Goodman 2008 Toxicological & Environmental Chemistry\u00a0Vol. 90, No. 5, September\u2013October 2008, 997\u20131008) were\u00a0even weaker than the Hewitson study, if that's possible. Sullivan dismisses both the  2008 study \u00a0and the 2010 study \u00a0 dismissed  . \u00a0Orac discusses t he other Hewitt macaque study, which was truly\u00a0 awful.\u00a0 \u00a0 In 2008, Kev  detailed Hewitson's gross conflicts of interest . \r\n \r\n Did you know that adjuvants are used in vaccines because they are cheaper than antigenic material? (This argument was made three times.) \r\n \r\n Silly me. \u00a0 I thought adjuvants\u00a0 \u00a0serve to: \r\n \r\n bring the antigen\u2014the substance that stimulates the specific protective immune response\u2014into contact with the immune system and influence the type of immunity produced, as well as the quality of the immune response (magnitude or duration); \r\n decrease the toxicity of certain antigens;\u00a0 \r\n and provide solubility to some vaccines components. \r\n \r\n \r\n Did you know that \"our immune systems didn't evolve to handle injected substances\" so anything administered by injection harms the immune system? \r\n \r\n What? \u00a0I think this is some sort of  chiropractic talking point , as well as being an article of faith among vaccine rejectionists. \u00a0 It's a false claim, of course . \r\n \r\n Did you know that doctors aren't \"taught what vaccine injury is, so they aren't in the mindset that vaccine injury can occur?\" and \"most doctors don't know about VAERS\" so don't tell patients to use it. \r\n \r\n Evidence-free reasoning at its best. \u00a0VAERS has been  covered in Pediatrics . \u00a0Vincent Iannelli MD, the About.com source on pediatrics,  has a page on how and why to report adverse vaccine reactions to VAERS . \r\n \r\n Did you know that the number of doses of Tdap required proves that the vaccine doesn't work? \r\n \r\n Science evolves. \u00a0Anti-science doesn't. \r\n \r\n Did you know that \"health can't come through a needle\"? \r\n \r\n A direct quote from  Sherri Tenpenny , anti-vaccination advocate. \r\n \r\n Did you know that \"there were diseases that went away without vaccines\" and \"the large drop in disease deaths was due to improved santitation and hygiene, not vaccines\". \r\n \r\n This one was the famous slide showing decreased  MORTALITY \u00a0(caution, goes to Whale.to) but somehow, the  MORBIDITY figures, which only declined after vaccination \u00a0aren't part of the presentation. \r\n \r\n Did you know that vaccination can \"only temporarily prevent you getting the disease\". \r\n \r\n Guess what? \u00a0N atural infection with chickenpox doesn't provide 100% protection from a later case of the disease either . \u00a0Neither does natural infection with whooping cough. \r\n \r\n Did you know that \"varicella infection [in early childhood] matures and primes the immune system\"? (There was more about the relationship between shingles and the varicella vaccine but I didn't write it down.) \r\n \r\n This sounds like pure  anthroposophy . \u00a0 But it is a quote from the odious\u00a0 Viera Scheibner 's\u00a0\u00a0 Immunizations: The Medical Assault on the Immune System \u00a0... \"there is no need to protect children from these childhood diseases.\u00a0These diseases are there to prime and mature their immune system.\u201d . \r\n \r\n Did you know that as US vaccination \"became more bloated, our rates of infant mortality also went up\"? \u00a0 \r\n \r\n Actually, this was interesting. LKH posted a table and one of the doulas present questioned her about infant mortality in third world countries; that the US would have a higher rate of mortality because we could try to sustain very-low-birthweight infants. LKH sidestepped and flashed the next slide. \u00a0But the study purporting to \"show\" this (Miller, N., & Goldman, G. (2011). Infant mortality rates regressed against number of vaccine doses routinely given: Is there a biochemical or synergistic toxicity?\u00a0Human & Experimental Toxicology\u00a0DOI:\u00a0 10.1177/0960327111407644 ) has been \u00a0taken apart by Respectful Insolence, \u00a0(\"The current study joins a long list of poorly planned, poorly executed, poorly analyzed studies that purport to show that vaccines cause autism, neurological diease, or even death. \") \r\n \r\n Did you know that McDonald and Paul proved that the increase in vaccines are linked to the autism epidemic? \r\n \r\n This one, too, had me rolling my eyes. \u00a0Sullivan at LeftBrain/RightBrain had the best  demolition of the methods \u00a0(\"The paper has made very little, if any, impact on the scientific community. But it has become part of the stable of poor quality papers used by those claiming that vaccines caused an autism epidemic.\") \r\n \r\n Did you know that the safety of aluminum in vaccines has never been studied? \r\n \r\n Wrong again. \u00a0  Still wrong . \r\n At that point, we left. \r\n That's all the bad news. The good news: Despite extensive publicity, the support of a large group of home-birth advocates, and 300 personal invitations, the audience numbered about 15 people, not including the three of us. \r\n Other views on the book: \r\n Part I: Review of book launch for \u00a0Vaccine Epidemic \r\n Part II: Review of book launch for \u00a0Vaccine Epidemic \r\n Part III: Review of book launch for \u00a0Vaccine Epidemic \r\n I'd forgotten about this from The Path Guy:  Anti-Immunization Activists: A Pattern of Deception. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n

We will profile a different autistic person every day, answering the same set of questions -- in a similar spirit to (although for copyright purposes otherwise unlike) the\u00a0 Proust questionnaire \u00a0capping each issue of Vanity Fair magazine. Why? We'd like to help our non-autistic readers get to know autistics as people \u00a0who have interesting, complicated lives, and who are as diverse and varied as any other random population united by a label. We are the people in each others' neighborhoods, and the more we know about each other, the more visible we and our children are, the more common Autism Acceptance will be.

What concerns me is the way in which the article appears to  give uncritical  support to the treatment offered by the Burzynski Clinic. There is much evidence to suggest that this clinic operates on the fringes of medical practice   and does little more than offer false hope  at a high price. A look at the Cancer Research UK website would have confirmed this. I fear that the consequences of this article will be to raise unrealistic expectations in other cancer sufferers and their families  and line the pockets of charlatans. I look to the Observer to provide balanced and informed articles. I hope therefore, that a future edition of the paper will address the issues I have raised. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Panic-Virus-Story-Medicine-Science/dp/1439158649", "http://blogs.plos.org/thepanicvirus/", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2011/nov/20/a-family-gripped-by-cancer", "http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-questions/what-is-antineoplaston-therapy", "http://nucella.wordpress.com/2011/11/25/dear-observer/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/11/mainstream-media-aiding-and-abetting-quackery-and-pseudoscience-burzynski-edition.html", "title": "Mainstream Media Aiding and Abetting Quackery and Pseudoscience: Burzynski Edition"},

I care when dollars that could be invested in those positive supports are solicited for organizations like Age of Autism [AoA]-- a for-profit, LLC company sponsored by an (alternative and so unregulated) pharmaceutical company -- which unironically and continuously attacks anyone who rightfully questions their horrifyingly misinformed and negative agenda as \"mercenary pharma shills.\" I care that your and AoA's negative messages have poisoned public perception about autism to the point where misinformed and mentally ill autism parents are killing their children because they're so afraid of autism. \r\n I care. Deeply. \r\n \r\n \r\n Age of Autism purports to be \"The Daily Web Newspaper of the Autism Epidemic\", but even a cursory examination of the published articles reveals it has two agendas: \u00a0\"Autism is Awful, Terrible, and Really Horrible for Parents\" and \"Autism Is All Vaccine Injury, We Don't Care That Science Says Otherwise\".\u00a0 \r\n That relentless drumbeat of awful and the vaccines is one reason we started The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism. \u00a0 \r\n To counter the fear and negativity, there's a twitter meme going:  #autismpride  \u00a0started  here \u00a0(Facebook) and at  Squidalicious . \r\n Update: \r\n From my friend and colleague Emily Willingham, mostly on  postpartum depression but also, signally, the damage autism fear-mongering can do: \r\n \r\n What I do know is that if she had paid attention to any one of the thousands of fear-mongering news media reports about autism, she'd've been terrified if, in her mind, her son were showing signs of it. I know that if she'd paid any attention at all to what some organizations that purport to help autistic people\u00a0 say about it , she'd've been terrified at the prospect. I also know that if she'd read any of the verbiage on the Internet about \" toxic \" children, \" monsters \" whose \"real selves\" were \"stolen\" from their parents, she'd be terrified. Stories purporting to describe the horrific financial burdens of autism. Stories focusing on the horrific toll autism reportedly\u00a0 takes on marriages \u00a0and families. Stories with the angle that\u00a0 autism destroys lives . In the aggregate, experiencing wave after wave of information about the alleged horrors of autism--and working in a place where she'd likely seen the most severely affected autistic people--did this mother see autism as the bogeyman of the darkest hours of the night, the thing that would take her child away and replace him with a monster? Would the autism monster steal her marriage, her finances, her\u00a0 fun ? She was insane, it seems certain, and still is. But the focus of her insanity was personal. Was autism for her what SIDS was for me, a thief in the night, the obsessions that haunted me in my mental abyss?

It's done in a cell line in a lab in little plastic containers like these: \r\n http://www.nuncbrand.com/en/page.aspx?ID=229 \r\n So the first thing we have to realize; this study only looks at one specific focus; those particular cells and their reaction to thimerosal. It does not take into account the rest of the organism; the circulatory system, the liver, etc - so there is no adsorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion (often called just ADME) here - all things which occur in our bodies. \r\n So we have to first understand that the results here may not accurately reflect what happens in a 'whole' organism.\u00a0 \r\n If we look at Figure 1 (which is actually mislabeled a/b wise in the 'window' of the study - but that's neither here nor there), we see two graphs. The top (a) graph shows the changes in mitotracker and ROS induced DCF levels as the concentration of thimerosal increases. \r\n (ROS = Reactive Oxygen Species) \r\n DCF = 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (I'm assuming - since they don't actually say specifically ANYWHERE in the paper what DCF is an abbreviation for). \r\n So how much ethyl mercury was there? \r\n At a concentration of about 2.5 uM (micro molar) we see a definitive (ie: significant) upswing in the fractional change, which is sustained through about 7.5 uM before it begins to tail off. \r\n How much mercury is in 2.5 uM of ethyl mercury? \r\n uM = umol/L \r\n (2.5 umol Et-Hg/L) * (1 umol Hg/1 umol Et-Hg) * (202.59 ug Hg/1 umol Hg) = 506.48 ug Hg/L \r\n There's 1 mole of Hg for every 1 mole of Et Hg, so there must be 1 micromole of Hg for every micromole of Et-Hg, and there's 202.59 grams of Hg per mole of Hg, therefore there must be 202.59 micrograms of Hg per micromole of Hg. \r\n So, we have 506.48 ug of Hg in each L.\u00a0 \r\n So now what? \r\n Well - we don't know how relative that number is. How does it compare to other studies of mercury?\u00a0 \r\n Let's compare that figure with the levels of Hg found in this study: \r\n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19560158 \r\n This study is in *preemies* - ie: low birth weight babies. \r\n Why am I comparing the two studies? Well - the preemie study looked at the excretion of mercury from the infants - as well as the blood concentrations.\u00a0 \r\n This is relevant, because you cannot get mercury into or past the BBB without it being in the bloodstream. \r\n So let's look at Figure 1. The highest amount of blood mercury recorded during this study was roughly 7.6 ng/mL. \r\n How does that compare to our 506.48 ug/L from the previous study? \r\n Well, that's rather simple. 1 ng/mL = 1 ug/L. So, the highest amount of blood mercury in the preemies in that study was 7.6 ug/L. (It's also interesting to note that the stools contained 10X the amount of mercury - on average - than the blood). \r\n (506.48/7.6) = 66.6 \r\n emphasis added by editor   The lowest amount of mercury which caused ROS generation in those astrocyte cells was over 60X the amount of mercury found in the bloodstream of infants within 48 hours of vaccination. \r\n The *average* amount of mercury found in those infants was 3.6 (+/- 2.1) ng/mL or 3.6 ug/L.

Simplicity because autism, for all its diversity, isn't complicated or scary or hard--it just is. Voice because autistic people have voices, otherwise we wouldn't be silenced. These two concepts go hand in hand.  \r\n Autistic brains are different from non-autistic brains--not better or worse, just different. Autistic voices, similarly, can take different forms or styles or express different things through different means than non-autistic voices. These facts are simple and neutral, but regularly obscured and overridden by cultural scripts and fallacies demanding broken, voiceless not-people stranded by huge chasms from the rest of the world in place of everyday autistics. Simplicity and voice are routinely sacrificed for dehumanization and spectacle. That's not our baggage, but when it's used to silence our voices and complicated our realities, it becomes our business.  \r\n The Loud Hands Project is designed as a counter to that, and this anthology is to be our guiding, founding document. \r\n \r\n Anthology Table of Contents \r\n \r\n Foreword \r\n Historical Foundations \r\n \r\n Don\u2019t Mourn For Us \r\n Autism Network International: The Development Of A Community And Its Culture \r\n Critic Of The Dawn \r\n The Future (And The Past) Of Autism Advocacy, Or Why The ASA\u2019s Magazine, The Advocate, Wouldn\u2019t Publish This Piece \r\n Retrospective At The National Press Club (transcript) \r\n The Beginnings of Autistic Speaking Day \r\n \r\n \r\n Current Realities \r\n \r\n Loud Hands & Loud Voices \r\n Dear Younger Self \r\n Loud Hands \r\n Perfectly Autistic, Perfectly Me \r\n Becoming Autistic, Becoming Disabled \r\n Non-Speaking, \u201cLow Functioning\u201d \r\n And Straight On Till Morning \r\n The Incapable Man \r\n Just Me \r\n \r\n \r\n What They Do To Us \r\n \r\n Quiet Hands \r\n They Hate You, Yes, You \r\n I Hid \r\n Speech, Without A Title \r\n This Is Why \r\n Grabbers \r\n Inhumane Beyond All Reason \r\n \r\n \r\n Rhetoric \r\n \r\n Why I Dislike \u201cPerson First\u201d Language \r\n Throw Away The Master\u2019s Tools: Liberating Ourselves From The Pathology Paradigm \r\n Killing Words \r\n Disability Catch-22s \r\n Like A Person \r\n Why No One Counts \r\n Passing As Ethics \r\n I\u2019m Spasticus Autisticus \r\n Connecting Dots \r\n Metaphor Stole My Autism \r\n Why Autism Speaks Hurts Us \r\n How Indistinguishability Got Its Groove Back \r\n \r\n \r\n Voice \r\n \r\n Plural Of Medium \r\n Metaphors Are Important \r\n An Ethnography Of Robotics \r\n Socializing Through Silence \r\n Are You Listening? \r\n Advocacy: Everyone Can Do It \r\n Pedagogy Of The Confused \r\n The Meaning Of Self Advocacy \r\n Autism, Speech, And Assistive Technology \r\n Untitled \r\n Run Forest Run: About Movement And Love \r\n On Being Articulate \r\n Loud Hands: I Speak Up With My Fingers \r\n Accepting MY Normal \r\n \r\n \r\n Moving Forward \r\n \r\n Autism Awareness Is Not Enough: Here\u2019s How To Change The World \r\n To My Beloved Autistic Community On Autism Acceptance Day 2012 \r\n What I Want To Say To Fellow Autistics \r\n Moving Forward: What\u2019s Next For The Loud Hands Project \r\n \r\n \r\n Conclusion \r\n \r\n On World Autism Awareness Day \r\n \r\n \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/dp/1938800028/", "http://theloudhandsproject.tumblr.com/post/31888933847/anthology-table-of-contents"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/12/loud-hands-autistic-people-speaking.html", "title": "Buy This Book: Loud Hands: Autistic People, Speaking "},

By bringing together self-advocate and researcher participants, the symposium served as \u00a0a starting point for meaningful dialogue between those conducting research on autism and the community of Autistic adults and youth. Confirmed participants include Administration on Developmental Disabilities Commissioner Sharon Lewis, ASAN President and IACC Public Member Ari Ne\u2019eman, National Institute on Child Health and Human Developmental Director Alan Guttmacher, Harvard Law Professor Michael Stein, Paula Durbin-Westby, Emily Titon, Liz Pellicano, David Rose and many more. \r\n This event was open to the general public without charge and was made possible by a grant from the Administration on Developmental Disabilities. \r\n \r\n Continue to live tweets after the page break \r\n \r\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n \r\n View the story \"ASAN Symposium: Ethical, Legal & Social Implications of Autism Research Part One\" on Storify ] \r\n \r\n View the story \"ASAN Symposium: Ethical, Legal & Social Implications of Autism Research Part Two\" on Storify ] \r\n \r\n View the story \"ASAN Symposium: Ethical, Legal & Social Implications of Autism Research Part Three\" on Storify ] \r\n \r\n View the story \"ASAN Symposium: Ethical, Legal & Social Implications of Autism Research Part Four\" on Storify ] \r\n There was significant additional discussion after lunch which I did not tweet or transcribe.

{"date": "Wednesday, December 14, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t There's a myth out there that parents are seeking an autism diagnosis for their children to \"collect a good SSI payment each month.\" I'm not making that up -- see my previous post, Sullivan at  LeftBrain/RightBrain , and  Caffeinated Autism Mom , this  TPGA Facebook page \u00a0-- especially read the comments. \u00a0This one woman articulated a myth that many have heard. \r\n SSI stands for  Supplemental Security Income \u00a0and it is a federal benefits program for the disabled. \u00a0 \r\n Michael Simpson ( @leftcoastman57  on twitter) left two comments ( one ,  two ) that deserve to be a post in their own right. \u00a0I've edited the comments slightly for clarity. \r\n \r\n I spend time every month, on a volunteer basis, assisting the mentally ill (or parents, family or caregivers) with obtaining disability benefits.  Usually, I assist those with diseases such a severe bipolar disorder or psychosis, but occasionally parents with autistic children (sometimes, as caretakers of autistic adults). \r\n SSI and SSDI (disability benefits that one earns by contributing to the Social Security system, and usually pay a lot more)\u00a0are need-based, with certain income ceilings.\u00a0 \r\n Let me make this clear.  Receiving SSI (or SSDI, which are disability benefits that one earns by contributing to the Social Security system, and usually pay a lot more) is not easy.  You do not just walk down to your local Social Security office, and say, \"I'm here, please write a check.\" \r\n The first step is a very long application.  That can be done online (this is where I assist, because I know the medical jargon, and assist the applicant in running down names of doctors, pharmaceuticals, hospitals, and diagnoses).  It takes 90 minutes, and it is complex.  To be honest, I'm pretty smart, and it takes a long while. \r\n The second step is that the Social Security Administration then sends out requests for information from all of your health care providers (because you have provided a release in the application).  They gather that information, and this may take a while, since physicians don't consider this a high priority.  This step usually happens 60 days after the initial application. \r\n The third step is that the Social Security medical team reviews the application.  One of three things may happen. \r\n \r\n They may accept it, and begin paying you.  This may happen, but I've been doing this for a couple of years, and I've yet to even hear a rumor of a friend of a cousin of a next-door-neighbor who's had that happen.  But they could.  My personal, non-evidentiary opinion is that they reject it to make people work at this application. \r\n They may ask you to visit one of their medical examiners who will review your case and your physical and mental status. \r\n They may reject your application.  You can appeal, and are encouraged to appeal. \r\n \r\n This may take up to six months.  To get SSI, you have to prove that you or a child is disabled.  And the burden of proof is on you.  So if you have three licensed pediatricians along with three pediatric psychologists who all agree that your child is autistic, the Social Security administration is going to have a hard time rejecting that.  This is an evidence-based system, not one based on opinion from either the bureaucrats or the applicants.  Sure there are mistakes made on both sides, and it is frustrating when it happens. \r\n One more thing.  It is not permanent.  Social Security regularly reviews the income of the family (well, that's automatic), the medical diagnosis, and other circumstances, all of which may cause the SSI payment to be revoked.  And cheating is a Federal Crime, so if, assuming bad faith somewhere, an applicant uses Dr. Smith who always signs off on these things, eventually they get caught. \r\n SSI isn't intended to cover the medical needs of an autistic child. Medicare or Medicaid (or in California, MediCal) should cover the medical needs. SSI should be used for education, clothing, food, etc. Yeah, I know, still not enough. I wish all of us were rich with outstanding private insurance so that we wouldn't have this discussion. \r\n \u00a0SSI is not a way to get rich.  It is there to help the truly needy in our system.  It does provide Medicare or Medical (Medicaid in other states).  It does help with education.  It is a good thing.  I'm sure a tiny percentage of applicants are trying to game the system.  Of course, the system is set up to block that (making it more difficult for legitimate claims), and it is hard, very hard, to get around it.  I'm pretty much an expert on SSI, and I can't see one way to get through it. \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \r\n\r\nNext, I need to write a post on destigmatizing SSI.  It's not a handout, it is a necessary support to families with extraordinary costs from disability.\n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/12/ignorance-adds-to-stigma-again/", "http://caffeinatedautismmom.blogspot.com/2011/12/getting-rich-off-autism-diagnosis.html", "http://www.facebook.com/thinkingpersonsguidetoautism/posts/237914356277622", "http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10026.html", "https://twitter.com/#!/leftcoastman57/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/12/supplemental-security-income-ssi-a-voice-of-experience.html", "title": "Supplemental Security Income (SSI): A Voice of Experience"},

Dr. Amador, a media-friendly psychologist (a specialty that does not deal with autism) told  Piers Morgan  that \u201ca symptom of autism\u201d is that \u201csomething\u2019s missing in the brain, a capacity for empathy, for social connection, which leaves the person suffering from this condition prone to serious depression and anxiety.\u201d \r\n \r\n No, autism is not a neurological condition that predisposes one to steal guns from one's parent and systematically murder the parent and children in  the parent's \u00a0a kindergarten classroom. \r\n The following are quotation from responses from autistics and autistic allies on the public speculations that Adam Lanza was autistic and that autism contributed to his murderous rampage, with links to the full statements. \r\n ( Revised to put statements in categories for easier navigation) \r\n Autistic Organizations Run By and For Autistics \r\n From Ari Ne'eman of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN) \r\n \r\n http://autisticadvocacy.org/2012/12/asan-statement-on-media-reports-regarding-newton-ct-shooting/ \r\n (in part) \" it is imperative that as we mourn the victims of this horrific tragedy that commentators and the media avoid drawing inappropriate and unfounded links between autism or other disabilities and violence.

Let us focus on the families impacted, and care for them, so that someday far off maybe we can explain\u2014though never justify\u2014what happened today. Perhaps then we will finally force those responsible for our care to pass legislations that could have helped prevent this tragedy, or revoke the legislations that may have assisted it.\" \r\n \r\n From Autism Women's Network,   http://autismwomensnetwork.org/article/awn%E2%80%99s-appeal-media-sources-covering-newtown-ct \r\n \r\n \r\n There is no evidence linking planned criminal violence to autism. \r\n With the tragic events unfolding regarding the recent school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, we here at Autism Women\u2019s Network send our heartfelt condolences to all the families. It is unimaginable what they are going through at this time. The loss of so many innocent lives is unspeakable and heartbreaking. \r\n With a few media sources reporting that the shooter is on the autism spectrum, we want to make an appeal that reporters and news outlets tread carefully in this regard.  \r\n First, nothing has been confirmed about any possible diagnosis the shooter may have had. \r\n Secondly, there is zero evidence linking planned crimes to autism. It cannot be stressed enough that autistic people, as well as all people with disabilities, are more likely to become victims of violence and crime rather than the perpetrators of such:\u00a0 Crime Victims with Developmental Disabilities. \r\n \r\n \r\nAutism Rights Watch, reposted at Wrong Planet\r\n \r\n http://www.wrongplanet.net/article439.html\r\n \r\n The search for answers should not be a search for a scapegoat. Autism is no excuse or explanation to evil. Being \u201cautistic\u201d, \u201codd\u201d,\"awkward\u201d, \u201ccamera shy\u201d, a \u201cnerd\u201d and \u201cuncomfortable with others\u201d does not cause a person to become a mass murderer. Autistic persons are more likely to be victims, rather than perpetrators of violence. Autism Rights Watch urges the public and the media outlets not to stigmatize the autistic persons and their families. They already are facing segregation and prejudices on a daily basis. \r\n From the Asperger's Association of New England (AANE) \r\n http://www.aane.org/blog/2012/12/16/aane-statement-on-the-tragedy-in-newtown-ct/ \r\n \r\n ....violence is not part of the Asperger or autism profile. People with Asperger syndrome or any other form of autism are far more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators of violence. Although it is impossible to conceive of a mass shooting as a mentally healthy act, the vast majority of mental health issues are not associated with violence. \r\n Our overwhelming concern is for the families of the victims through their deep, enduring grief and devastation. We hope too that the conversation around Adam Lanza will be thoughtful and considerate of people who have Asperger syndrome or other forms of autism and their families. When myths and misunderstandings are perpetuated, nonviolent people with the same condition suffer. It is painful and frightening to feel associated by virtue of a diagnosis with someone who has committed such a horrific crime.\r\n \r\n \r\n From Michael John Carley of the Global and Regional Asperger Syndrome Partnership (GRASP) \r\n http://grasp.org/profiles/blogs/turnaround-time-many-media-outlets-trying-to-stop-the-nonsense-ot \r\n \r\n As many of you all no doubt saw, certain media outlets described autism and Asperger's Syndrome as signifying a great potential for violent behavior . . . even though studies show the exact opposite. While TV news gives a lot of charlatan clinicians airtime, it really seemed more the cause of an irresponsible rush to report than to demonize what we have. But suddenly our kids, most of whom are at a challenged social standing enough as it is, were being sent into schools where their peers had been informed on TV that being weird or socially aloof was something to be petrified of . . . and anti-bullying campaigns were set back a bit. Such \"coverage\" not only was inaccurate, but it was inaccurate (as we all know) and it prevented many of us all from trying to mourn with the families as best as we inadequately could. \r\n \r\n From autistic individuals \r\n From Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg, writing at Disability and Representation \r\n \r\n http://www.disabilityandrepresentation.com/2012/12/15/when-children-die-grieve-reflect-dont-scapegoat/ \r\n \"I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Autism is not a predisposing factor to premeditated violence. Autistic people are far, far more likely to be the victims of crime than its perpetrators. \r\n And the same goes for mental illness. Most mentally ill people do not harm anyone and are at much greater risk of being the victims of violence.\" \r\n \r\n From Paula C. Durbin-Westby at her blog \r\n \r\n http://paulacdurbinwestbyautisticblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/mother-with-asperger-syndrome-grieves.html \r\n http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2012/12/how-one-mother-with-asperger-syndrome.html \r\n I would like to be able to grieve just as other parents all over America are doing,without the added baggage of the media's portrayal of Autistics as \"dangerous loners\" (or of \"dangerous loners\" as Autistics). \r\n \r\n Emily Willingham on her 11 year old autistic son's response\u00a0 \r\n \r\n http://www.emilywillinghamphd.com/2012/12/autism-empathy-and-violence-one-of.html?spref=fb \r\n http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2012/12/autism-empathy-and-violence-one-of.html \r\n http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/17/autism-empathy-connecticut-shooting_n_2314769.html \r\n He knows about the Dec. 14 shootings in Connecticut. When he learned about them, his first response was to turn away in the chair where he was sitting, drooping his head over the back. He stayed that way for many long minutes, quiet and still. When he turned around again, my child who rarely, rarely cries, had tears in his eyes. And then, his first urgent concern: That we break from homeschooling and go get his brother, our youngest son and in first grade, from school ... now. And as we drove to the school to pick up his brother, whom I badly wanted to see and hug and hear, my oldest, autistic son voiced what I'd already decided: \"Let's not tell him what happened. That's not something he needs to know. It would make him too anxious and scared.\" Perspective-taking and empathy, you see. \r\n Planned, social violence is not a feature of autism. Indeed, autistic people are far  more likely to have violence done against them  than to do violence to others. No one knows as of this writing what drove the Connecticut shooter to kill 20 children and 7 adults, point blank, although obvious candidates are rage, hate, a huge grudge against humanity, and some triggering event. But if he turns out to have been someone on the spectrum, I'd like to remind everyone that autism is not an explanatory factor in his actions. And that autistic people like my son are fully, fully capable of empathizing with those who were the target of them. \r\n \r\nFrom Shian (an autistic adult)  at TOTKO in the UK\r\n http://hellototko.blogspot.com/2012/12/im-autistic-person-not-killer.html \r\n \r\nThere are violent people all other the world committing mindless violent acts all the time.\u00a0 Naturally people want answers.\u00a0 So we pinpoint whatever we can and set it up for the blame. Gay?\u00a0 Muslim?\u00a0 Autistic? \u00a0 Stereotyping is a dangerous thing.\u00a0 I\u2019m one of those people currently being stereotyped and I can tell you, hand on my heart, I am anything but a violent killer.\u00a0 In fact, if people knew anything about Autism, the connection between violence and Autism wouldn\u2019t even occur them. \r\n \r\n An autistic adult, The Pirate Hook (warning, some violent language)\r\n http://thepiratehook.tumblr.com/post/37961855288/im-going-to-sound-like-an-asshole-and-you-know#\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nIf it turns out that he does have a form of autism, that does not mean that his sociopathy reflects on the rest of us. We are not violent people - the ratio of those of us with autism who would do something this disturbing to those of us who would not is very low. But to project that image of violence onto us is distorting the image of what we are.\u00a0\r\n \r\nFrom Yes That Too, autistic adult,  http://yesthattoo.blogspot.com/2012/12/in-response-to-connecticut.html\r\n \r\n \r\n We can't actually talk about this continuous pinning of shootings on autism without talking about the stigma of disability, especially disabilities that are based in the brain. We can't \u00a0actually talk about it without talking about the power differences between Autistic people and those who keep pinning mass murder on the way our brains are wired. \r\n People keep saying that now is not the time to talk about this, but the instant the accusation has been made, the time to talk is now. The \"no politics in a tragedy\" rule is broken by the attack on my neurology, and I am allowed to defend myself, no matter how political, long-winded, or anything else you could call my defense. I am not the one derailing the conversation about a tragedy. I am the one answering an attack on the very core of who I am, and I am permitted that answer everywhere and everywhen such an attack happens. \r\n Autism does not equate to violence. Sociopathy does not equate to violence. Lack of empathy does not equate to violence. Mental illnesses do not equate to violence. In fact, it leads to disproportionately being the  victim , not the perpetrator, of abuses.\r\nRead that again. You blame brain differences that lead to being disproportionately  victimized \u00a0for leading people to commit crimes. That is backwards. That is the opposite of the right thing to do. That is what happens, every time. That needs to  stop .\r\nEvery one of us needs to answer this, every place we see it. \r\n \r\n From Kassiane S., an autistic adult, \r\n \r\n http://timetolisten.blogspot.com/2012/12/plea-from-scariest-kid-on-block.html \r\n Yet another mass killing. Yet another tragedy. It is terrible. It is horrible. It is wrong. \r\n \u00a0People are scared. \r\n People are looking for a group to be scared of. \r\n Ladies, gentlemen, other august personages, I am the monster you are afraid of. For my entire life I have been. The reasoning changes, but I always come down on the wrong side of the line. I am always who the media, the talking heads, the papers, now the blogs, who the people you listen to tell me to fear. \r\n \u00a0And this makes being me terrifying. It makes being me unsafe. \r\n \r\n From Troubador at Daily Kos \r\n http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/12/15/1170176/-They-re-Saying-the-Shooter-Had-Asperger-s# \r\n The shooter at Sandy Hook is being reported as having had Asperger's Syndrome - an autistic spectrum disorder that has only had a relatively small amount of cultural exposure, so if it turns out to be correct, this would be how most of America (and the world) is introduced to it: As a dangerous mental illness associated with psychotic acts of violence - which is about as far from the truth as one could possibly get.  Speaking as someone who has Asperger's, this could add an additional (though by no means equivalent) layer of tragedy on top of an already fathomless horror if this monstrous act came to be how people with this disability are defined in the popular imagination.  The discussion should rightly focus mainly on gun control, but I'm disturbed by the tenor of some of the media statements I've seen when the subject turns to mental health, and would hope it's not a sign of a potentially damaging misconception being created.\r\n \r\nAmy Gravino, autistic adult:\r\n http://minikitkatgirl.blogspot.com/2012/12/thoughts-on-sandy-hook-tragedy-and.html \r\n \r\n ......I am sitting here now, trying to make sense of the Connecticut shootings and the media's irresponsibility in characterizing the shooter as having Asperger's Syndrome, and despite Linda's glowing accolades...I am at a loss. As I wade through the jumble of disbelief, sadness, heartache, and a steadily growing sense of fear, there is only one thing that I know for certain: \r\n I won't go back. \r\n I won't go back to believing that I am the only person going through what I am going through.  \r\n I won't go back to being that voiceless, frightened girl who thought that she was nothing and would never be anything.  \r\n I won't go back to when words like autism and Asperger's Syndrome had no recognition, no meaning...no place in the world.  \r\n \r\n From Savannah Nicole Logsdon-Breakstone \r\n http://crackedmirrorinshalott.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/i-was-one-of-the-scary-kids/ \r\n \r\n I didn\u2019t want to write about the shootings at all. I knew a number of people (who I\u2019ll link to throughout this post) and organizations would be posting and writing, working to counter the inevitable stigma fail that would happen. I even was keeping to commenting on the links of people I care about, people who I know and who I want to have these sorts of discussions with. Then, it happened. I\u2019ll leave the critiques of the post gawker promoted to others, but I feel obligated to make a comment about some of the assumptions it is based on and promotes.\r\n \r\n That comment starts with a declaration: I was one of those scary kids. \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\nFrom Karla Fisher, autistic adult, at Karla's ASD Page on Facebook\r\n http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=399797193428068&set=a.272416929499429.64583.155369821204141&type=1&theater \r\n \r\nYes this is a civil rights issue and when I finally again find my strength, I will come back stronger and harder than before. For now I must lay low and focus on keeping my job and my life together within the context of this onslaught of discrimination and within the context of my own grieving.\r\n \r\n http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=400219743385813&set=a.272416929499429.64583.155369821204141&type=1 \r\n \r\n It is improved this time in so many ways... The autistic community and its allies are fighting a good fight. Most media sources are retracting and correcting their earlier words... \r\n Alas the fallout from their mistakes are still out there. Stay diligent, stay strong and stay safe everyone.  \r\n \r\n From Zooey Roberts on Facebook \r\n http://www.facebook.com/notes/zoey-roberts/people-with-autismaspergers-are-not-murderers-and-killers/10150254783734997 \r\n \r\n Some people are looking for a scapegoat to pin this horrible mass-murder on. This search for a scapegoat is widening the pain and making the world a more scary and dangerous place for people who are Autistic or have any other disability that makes them 'different.' This is hurtful to large groups of people who are not violent and are much more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators of violence. \r\n  I don't feel comfortable wearing my Autism clothing in the current hostile environment. \r\n  \r\n From Steve Summer, autistic adult, on Facebook \r\n http://www.facebook.com/notes/steve-summers/autism-is-irrelevant-to-the-sandy-hook-elementary-shootings/536918066318839 \r\n \r\n Autism is Irrelevant to the Sandy Hook Elementary Shootings. \r\n The media is looking for a scapegoat to hang the Sandy Hook tragedy on. Some have mentioned the killer may have had Aspergers. The truth is the vast majority of Autistic/Aspergers people are very inclined to follow rules and are not violent. Autistic people are far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators of it. \r\n \r\n From Landon Bryce \r\n http://thautcast.com/drupal5/content/being-part-functional-community \r\n \r\n I still don't know if Adam Lanza had any kind of autism. The confirmation of a divorce mediator is better than that of classmates, but it's not conclusive. It's not surprising at all the popular media would take \"autism\" and run with it, that they would be careless about linking autism with violence, even though research does not tell us there is any link at all between autism and the kind of planned attack Lanza appears to be guilty of. \r\n\r\n The strength and unity with which our community has risen up to refute those assertions and assert the humanity of autistic people is somewhat surprising. \r\n \r\n From autism allies \r\n Jess at Diary of a Mom \r\n \r\n http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/stepping-into-the-void/#comment-33816 \r\n \"Fear becomes truth. Misconceptions and misperceptions and outright lies become the popular zeitgeist. Autistic people who have struggled for so long to be understood \u2014 who have finally, painstakingly made strides in changing  age-old misconceptions  about who they are \u2013 who have begun to be seen by \u00a0society in all of the glory of their complete human dimension are suddenly and terrifyingly thrown back at warp speed to the days of Boo Radley \u2013 to a time when it\u2019s okay to channel society\u2019s fear into that which is different \u2013 to point fingers at that difference and to connect it to evil \u2013 to blame it for incomprehensibly monstrous acts and in so doing to make them the target of all of our sadness and anger and desperate, aching fear that it could happen again. \r\n Every time that we let this go, every time that those with a platform to make a change stand by in silence, fear grows. \r\n Every time that good people say nothing, my daughter, my friends \u2014 ALL OF US \u2014 pay the price. \r\n Please, use your voice in any way that you can. \r\n Don\u2019t allow one tragedy to give birth to another. \r\n \r\n From ProfMomEsq \r\n \r\n http://profmomesq.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/one-truth-about-autism-and-the-sandy-hook-elementary-tragedy/ \r\n \r\n (in part) I don\u2019t know what motivated Adam Lanza to do what he did. \u00a0As I said several times yesterday, we call such acts \u201csenseless,\u201d because they literally defy logic, reason or explanation. \u00a0What I\u00a0do know is that Adam Lanza did not kill 27 people and himself because he was autistic. \u00a0Autism is a neurologic disorder; it is not a mental illness. \u00a0Even if autism were a mental illness, that does not mean that its diagnostic criteria include propensity for violence. \u00a0Compare the DSM-IV\u00a0criteria for a diagnosis of autism\u00a0with those for a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. \u00a0Lacking an ability to express or engage social or emotional reciprocity is NOT the same as callous indifference to others\u2019 feelings, a low threshold for discharge of aggression or the incapacity to experience guilt. \u00a0I don\u2019t know how any reasonably trained psychologist or psychiatrist could look at the diagnostic criteria for autism and even\u00a0speculate that it caused or contributed to a violent outburst of truly epic proportions. \u00a0Yet, we don\u2019t hear the talking-head doctors speculating that Adam Lanza suffered from antisocial personality disorder. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Because that doesn\u2019t have the same political sound-bite quality as \u201cautism.\u201d\r\n \r\nFrom Autismum, in Wales\r\n http://autismum.com/2012/12/15/ct-shootings/ \r\n I think it is worth reminding ourselves just how quick the media are to demonize autistic people. This piece by  Kassiane S  is a response to the very same speculation that abounded after the Aurora shootings. The fact that it has once again, become so horribly relevant is more than dismaying \u2013 it is terrifying.\r\n \r\nSharon, mother to an autistic  11 year old \r\n http://www.blog.mamasturnnow.com/2012/12/15/words/ \r\n \r\nMy heart is heavy too and I can understand the world\u2019s need to explain how someone could do something like take the lives of so many innocent people. BUT when I hear the media start to make accusations such as the fact that the shooter has ASPERGERS as a reason why this tragedy happened\u2026 well it makes my blood boil. Maybe he did have Autism and maybe he was right-handed or had brown eyes. He was a bad egg and whether or not he had Autism is not a factor. Once again everything we all work so hard to do, to make the world see our Autistic love ones as PEOPLE first and who have empathy and compassion just like everyone else can be washed away in a second because some stupid comment! My son has Aspergers and he is not a monster. Sorry I know I am preaching to the choir but I am just so upset!\r\nWhen the media makes comments in their search for understanding ( and ratings less not forget that)\u00a0 before having all the real facts they often do more harm than good. People hear these WORDS and if they have no prior experience with say\u2026 Aspergers for example, well they take these words that when strung together create pictures and images and ideas and stereotypes as FACTS. And once those WORDS are out there\u2026 well it can take forever to erase the damage that they can do. And they create damage people. What we say, or perhaps what we DON\u2019T Say matter!\r\n \r\nJess at Diary of a Mom on Facebook\r\n http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10151160838256937&id=310066991936 \r\n \r\nIt's inevitable. When the unthinkable happens, the talking heads search for explanations. They look for defining words. A diagnosis to blame. Something that will make sense of the senseless. The news outlets are now honing in on speculation that the shooter was on the spectrum. They are calling him 'odd' and using words like 'detached' - they are repeating the dangerous and desperately inaccurate myth that we've been talking about here for days - that autistic people lack empathy. They are searching in the wrong places for answers. And it's up to us, the community of autistic people and those who love them to set the record straight. When you hear a news outlet say something that you know is not true - when they imply that those on the autism spectrum are prone to violence (when in reality they are exponentially more likely to be the VICTIMS of violence), when you hear that they lack empathy, speak up. Every news outlet has contact info on their website. Use it. Talk to your friends, your neighbors, your family. There is nothing more dangerous than misplaced fear. We have a responsibility to each other - to our children. \r\n By Miz KP, autism parent http://sailingautisticseas.com/defending-autism-as-we-mourn/ \r\n \r\n The autism factor in this case has brought up a lot of debate and discussion. The autism factor angers me because it should not be a factor. We have not heard that the shooter, Adam Lanza, had autism from an official source. Even if we had, it should not be what we cling to as the reason for these heinous acts. \r\n I am heartbroken for all the families who have lost loved ones. I am also defensive of autism. I am defensive because the inference that autism is the reason for these horrific killings is misleading and erroneous. Parents like me cringe every time a news reporter reports this as a known fact. Our children already live in a world where they are stigmatized. This is not helping. \r\n \r\n From Kate Donovan at Ashely Miller's Freethought Blog  http://freethoughtblogs.com/ashleymiller/2012/12/14/when-you-tie-shootings-to-mental-illness/ \r\n \r\n Adam Lanza\u2019s mental health won\u2019t be known. Not ever. There\u2019s a lot of things we\u2019d like him answer for\u2013unclaimed Christmas presents and crying families and six year olds with cameras on them and reporters in their faces. We\u2019d like to know why he did it. We want to know what was going on in that mind. There\u2019s no explanation that will put this into perspective. Because, what kind of perspective could it be to understand what would drive you to kill children?\r\n \r\n But I\u2019m asking you\u2013begging you, really, to not decide that Lanza had a mental illness.  \r\n I\u2019m asking you not to make \u201cbeing a good person\u201d the standard for mentally healthy.\r\n \r\n Do not try to rationalize this away with mental illness. Stop talking about how it could have been schizophrenia, stop saying he  had  to have mental health issues. You do not know.\r\n \r\n \r\nYou  do not know  his state of mind.  \r\n When you decide to armchair quarterback him, to stamp him with an \u201cobvious\u201d diagnosis, do you know what you are saying?\" \r\n Here is a terrible thing. The only thing that could possibly cause someone to do such a terrible, tragic thing is to have This Disorder. Because only people with This Disorder could be so dangerous/awful/scary. \r\n \r\n From The Autism Life (parent of an autistic), about a conversation with her child\u00a0 http://www.facebook.com/notes/the-autism-life/thats-just-not-what-autism-is/10151246304340896 \r\n \r\n \u201cOk, so if someone says something to you about this, what will you say and how will you say it?\u201d \r\n He shrugged his shoulders and said calmly, \u201cLike this.\u00a0 I may be different, but I would never hurt anyone.\u201d \r\n I smiled, this is so simple for him.\u00a0 Why had I made it more complicated in my mind?\u00a0 I added, \u201cAnything else?\u201d \r\n He said, with an air of finality to the conversation, \u201cThat\u2019s just not what autism is.\u201d \r\n \r\n From Cara Liebowitz \r\n http://www.thatcrazycrippledchick.blogspot.com/2012/12/praying-for-time-sandy-hook-shootings.html \r\n \r\n I sit across the table, discussing the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings with people I love, people I respect, people who I trust.\u00a0 I know I'm treading on thin ice, but it's like a car wreck, I can't stop, can't look away.\u00a0 And then the ice cracks, oh god, here it comes, it always boils down to this.\u00a0 With smug conviction she says: \"We need to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill.\" I take a deep breath, but can't stop my voice from rising.\u00a0 I stare straight at her as I challenge: \u00a0 \"So you're saying that I shouldn't be able to own a gun?\u00a0 I have mental illnesses.\" Whether or not I would actually want to own a gun is irrelevant; it's the principle of the thing.\u00a0 The response is instantaneous. \"Not\u00a0 you !\" The implication is that I'm being ridiculous for drawing a logical conclusion.\u00a0 \"Having depression or anxiety is different.\u00a0 I'm talking about psychopaths.\"\u00a0 \r\n \r\n From Amy Caraballo \r\n http://ravingmotherfromhell.blogspot.com/2012/12/my-broken-back.html \r\n \r\n Autistics and individuals with other disabilities are no more likely to commit violent crime than non-disabled people. In fact, people with disabilities of all kinds, including autism, are much more likely to be the victims of violent crime. Attributing autism as a motive to this heinous crime is no more valid than attributing Adam Lanza's maleness, human-ess, or the fact that he lived in Connecticut. Though all of these things are true, they do not motivate one to murder. \r\n Today I live in fear because of a rhetorical interpretation of the 2nd Amendment. I fear that I cannot safely go Christmas shopping without the possibility that a \"legal\" gun owner might go on a killing spree. Leaving our home increases the likely-hood my family will die by gunfire. I fear my family may end up collateral damage so that gun enthusiasts can continue to stockpile assault weapons. \r\n But I mostly live in fear for my autistic child. A victim of abuse by the hands of \"typical\" people, my child, who values life above all, is now the target of a media frenzy. \r\n \r\n From M. O'Callahan at Skeptoid \r\n http://skeptoid.com/blog/2012/12/17/sinister-speculation-part-1-autism/ \r\n \r\n We have to make sense of these massacres by assuming someone or something makes the perpertrators less than human. It is easier, for some, to explain away Lanza\u2019s actions by assigning him to a group that is already stigmatised than to really examine how and why this happened or to accept that human will is, actually, unfathomable. Were it to emerge that Lanza was indeed on the autistic spectrum it would tell us little to nothing about what made him carry out his atrocious acts. The dehumanising of people with disabilities and mental illness has a long and creepy history. Judging by the reaction both in the media and on social networks, it has a very healthy future. \r\n \r\n Ellen Seidman (mother of a special-needs child)\u00a0 \r\n http://www.lovethatmax.com/2012/12/the-connecticut-shootings-whats-autism.html \r\n \r\n ...School shootings may be getting more common in modern-day America, but so is pointing the finger at autism as the cause\u2014and it could hurt kids and adults with special needs like Max. \r\n ....\"Asperger syndrome and other autism spectrum disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders, not personality disorders. People with Asperger's may be prone to behavior like aggressive outbursts and temper tantrums\u2014but there is no proof they are prone to violence,\" says psychiatrist Mohammad Ghaziuddin, M.D., in his book Mental Health Aspects of Autism and Asperger Syndrome. \r\n \r\n \r\n From Jillsmo \r\n http://yeahgoodtimes.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-connecticut-tragedy-and-autism.html \r\n \r\nI sent this letter to every single person I could think of at our district, including the Superintendant and the School Board.  Feel free to grab it and use it as your own, although I did borrow some of the language from the  Autism Discussion Page on Facebook .\r\n \r\n From Jim Walter at BloggingLily \r\n \r\n http://blogginglily.blogspot.com/2012/12/its-not-autism.html \r\n \r\n \r\nRecently an article was written by a mother claiming to have a child similar to the Newtown shooter.  The article doesn't flat out claim a formal diagnosis for her son, but instead \"throws out some terms\", one of which is \"autism\", and then describes behavior that, because of the reference, essentially implies that autistics are violent and disturbed.  The post went viral.  So of course every idiot with access to the internet now has at least SOME inkling in his head that autism is bad and leads to mass murder.  A blogging friend of mine, Jillsmo, had the idea of writing to her school district and just sort of laying it on the line to clarify or do damage control.  Some of this has been borrowed from Jillsmo's \"template\" and modified to better reflect my voice.  I sent this to the administrators and teachers of my daughter's school district.  It's more important than my usual schlock, you're free to use it or share it if you wish.\r\n \r\n From Lucy Berrington at Psychology Today Blogs \r\n http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/aspergers-alive/201212/the-pain-being-linked-asperger-dx-mass-shooter \r\n \r\n In the wake of the harrowing deaths of twenty young children and seven adults, it is difficult to focus on anything else. But theautism community has had to. Early reports included speculation that the shooter had Asperger syndrome and an unknown psychiatric condition, raising fears of retaliation against those who are neurologically or psychiatrically different. \r\n So it\u2019s deeply heartening that many members of the autism community have posted eloquent responses, some of which are climbing high in the internet search charts, and major news outlets have begun to emphasize that Asperger\u2019s and autism are not connected to planned violence. I can't help sort-of-hoping we retire any neurological or mental health diagnostic labels associated with this guy, for the sake of the millions of nonviolent people who also bear them. (Maybe that's an argument for being pleased with DSM-5 after all.) \r\n \r\n \r\nFrom Mike Stanton (autism parent and advocate) http://penumbrage.com/2012/12/19/adam-lanza-scapegoating-is-not-the-answer/\u00a0 \r\n \r\n In their eagerness to explain the inexplicable sections of the media have focused on identifiable sub cultures and categories of people in society. see for example the lurid profile of Lanza in \u00a0the Sun .\u00a0None of this helps to explain why Adam Lanza acted the way he did. But it does increase the likelihood of bullying and\u00a0violence\u00a0against these disparate elements in society. This irresponsible behaviour may inadvertently add to the list of Lanza\u2019s victims. \r\n \r\n From Pucks and Puzzle Pieces, an autism parent \r\n http://pucksandpuzzlepieces.com/2012/12/19/what-i-worry-about/ \r\n Our kids face enough challenges without people, fueled by wild media speculation, making assumptions about what their social awkwardness or quirky behaviors ultimately say about them. I surely hope that is not one of the lasting legacies of Newtown. Instead, I hope this can spark meaningful discussion about mental health and support services. It sounds like Lanza was well supported by his school system. Did he fall off \u201cthe cliff of 18?\u201d We may never know what happened to cause him to commit such atrocities. But perhaps, among the many, many things in our society that need to be examined in the wake of this tragedy, the lack of support for adults in the special needs community can fall somewhere on the list. \r\n From Mnosal49, an autism parent \r\n\r\n http://mnosal49.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/a-personal-letter-for-the-woman-who-called-the-autistic-population-violent/ \r\n \r\n You see Elisabeth; your angry words have hurt innocent children in a different way than a violent killer. You have killed with your words however. You have killed the self esteem of children in the autism community and their parents with your words. You have broken their hearts, saddened them and caused insecurity to surface. We do not need guns to kill because words kill people as well. It kills their hopes, dreams, and basically their drive to achieve and hope. \r\n In reading your angry commentary and vulgarity aimed towards the autism community I perceived something else. An angry woman with a filthy mouth who is looking for someone to blame all the wrong doing in society on. You mentioned in your letter that society should stop making excuses for people on the autism spectrum and accept them for who they are. Perhaps you need to stop making excuses for your own anger, accept why you are lashing out at innocent children with autism, and find out why you feel the need to do so. \r\n \r\n From Jillsmo at Yeah. Good Times.  \r\n http://yeahgoodtimes.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-letter-to-elisabeth-ja.html \r\n \r\nThis screenshot has been making the Facebook rounds; I don't know where it originated from and I've done my best to remove the identifying information. Seeing this makes me want to start sobbing and run and hide from the world, but instead of lying on the floor in the fetal position, I thought I would try to calmly respond to this, in the hopes that Elisabeth might see it\r\n \r\n From Ariane Zurcher at Emma's Hope Book \r\n http://emmashopebook.com/2012/12/18/where-fear-leads-us/ \r\n http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ariane-zurcher/autism-fear_b_2331797.html \r\n \r\n Once we\u2019ve become convinced that something is worth fearing it is extremely difficult to reverse.  When we speak of Autism using words and phrases that cause us to fear Autistic people, we are doing tremendous harm in the short and long-term to that population, harm that will be very difficult to reverse.   Convincing people to feel fearful about something or someone is one of the easiest things to do.  Convincing them, once they are convinced, that it was all a \u201cfalse alarm\u201d is extremely hard.  So when those first news reports came out linking Aspergers with the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, it only took an unethical few to do tremendous damage to an entire population of people.  Despite the fact that if you google \u201cAspergers and violence\u201d the first dozen pages that come up are articles stating that there is absolutely NO connection between Aspergers and violence.  And yet, my Autistic friends and I are terrified. \r\n I am frightened for my Autistic daughter and for those I love and care about who are Autistic.  I am frightened by what people will assume and how they will then treat those they assume are Autistic.  I am frightened for my friends who are Autistic, will they be safe?  Will a non autistic person hurt them, say cruel things to them, treat them differently because they fear \u201cautism\u201d and therefore \u201cAutistics\u201d?  I am frightened even though the truth is neurotypical people are far more likely to commit acts of violence than Autistics.  Watch these videos on Youtube \u2018 here \u2018 and \u2018 here \u2018.  Videos showing Autistic and disabled people being tortured by others.  Read these reports \u2018 here\u2019 , \u2018 here \u2018, \u2019 here \u2018 and \u2018 here \u2018 about the systematic abuse of Autistic people, abuse that continues unabated all the time. \r\n \r\n From autism organizations not run by autistics \r\n The Autism Society of America on Facebook: \r\n https://www.facebook.com/AutismSociety/posts/10151183638781194 \r\n \r\n This morning, many national media outlets are reporting that the shooter was autistic. While as of yet, this has not been officially documents, many newspapers and television outlets are stating that the individual who shot the children and teachers was autistic. And, in such reports, there is an implication that autism might have had an impact on the person's mindset in leading to the shootings.\u00a0 \r\n There is absolutely no evidence or any reliable research that suggests a linkage between autism and planned violence. To imply or suggest, as some are doing, that some linkage exists is wrong and harmful to the over 1.5 million law abiding, non-violent and wonderful individuals who live with autism each and every day. Stereotyping an entire group of individuals because of the actions of one is something is wrong and can't be accepted.\u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n Elizabeth Feld, President, Autism Speaks \r\n http://www.autismspeaks.org/news/news-item/statement-newtown-connecticut \r\n Our hearts go out to the families and town of Newtown, Connecticut in the wake of this heartbreaking event. Several media outlets are reporting that the shooter might have had an autism spectrum disorder. Some have also inaccurately reported that there is a linkage between autism and planned violence. We ask that blame not be placed on people with disabilities or disorders in the midst of these types of tragedies and that everyone keep the families of Newtown in their prayers.\r\n \r\nFrom the Autistic Global Initiative Committee and the Autism Research Institute\r\n http://myemail.constantcontact.com/ARI-Adult-Leadership-Committee-s-Statement-on-Newtown--CT.html?soid=1101659254324&aid=K7iUvjKFWRo \r\n \r\n Our thoughts and prayers are with the community of Newtown, Connecticut today in the wake of yesterday's tragedy. Some public comments have drawn potentially inaccurate and stigmatizing conclusions about a link between the diagnosis and a propensity for violence and lack of empathy. \r\n Autism is not a mental health disorder - it is a neurodevelopmental disorder. The autism community has long labored toward building understanding, awareness, and trust within communities throughout the United States and the world. As adults with autism living productive, peaceful lives, we urge the media and professionals who participate in speculative interviews about the motives of the accused shooter to refrain from misleading comments about autism and other neurodevelopmental disabilities. The eyes of the world are on this wrenching tragedy - with 1 in 88 now diagnosed, misinformation could easily trigger increased prejudice and misunderstanding.  Let us all come together and mourn for the families and exercise the utmost care in discussions of how and why it occurred. \r\n \r\n From Judy Endow on behalf of the Autism Research Institute and the Autistic Global Initiative \r\n http://www.autism.com/index.php/awareness \r\n \r\n Due to the media speculation that Adam Lanza, the suspect in the recent Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy, may have been affected with Asperger Syndrome, concern has developed on several fronts. Of immediate  concern is fear that students returning to school who have been previously identified with having an Autism Spectrum Disorder may now be stigmatized, especially those who may exhibit meltdown behaviors in the educational setting. \r\n The politically incorrect question on everybody\u2019s mind is, \u201cAre students with ASD dangerous when they have meltdowns and might this behavior lead to another Sandy Hook kind of incident at our school?\u201d \r\n \r\n Articles in main-stream media \r\n Priscilla Gilman at the New York Times \r\n http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/opinion/dont-blame-autism-for-newtown.html?_r=0 \r\n \r\n ....While autistic children can sometimes be aggressive, this is usually because of their frustration at being unable to express themselves verbally, or their extreme sensory sensitivities. Moreover, the form their aggression takes is typically harmful only to themselves. In the very rare cases where their aggression is externally directed, it does not take the form of systematic, meticulously planned, intentional acts of violence against a community. \r\n And if study after study has definitively established that a person with autism is no more likely to be violent or engage in criminal behavior than a neurotypical person, it is just as clear that autistic people are far more likely to be the victims of bullying and emotional and physical abuse by parents and caregivers than other children. So there is a sad irony in making autism the agent or the cause rather than regarding it as the target of violence. \r\n \r\n From Mari-Jane Williams at the Washington Post \r\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-parenting/post/newtown-shootings-media-coverage-creates-dangerous-stereotypes-of-people-with-autism/2012/12/17/2341fb42-4868-11e2-820e-17eefac2f939_blog.html \r\n \r\n Seidman, Durbin-Westby, Peete and Rosa all said the focus is, and should be, on the victims of this crime and their families. Their losses are unimaginable. The four women expressed mixed feelings about discussing autism in the aftermath of the tragedy. But they also felt that, given the coverage, they had no choice. \r\n \u201cWe should be talking about these families, about better mental health care, about gun control, instead of having to do this social triage when that\u2019s not the main concern,\u201d Rosa said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe in the midst of this horrible tragedy, this is what we have to do.\u201d \r\n \r\n From Lisa Quinones-Fontanez at Parenting \r\n\r\n http://www.parents.com/blogs/to-the-max/2012/12/17/uncategorized/what-autism-parents-want-you-to-know-about-autism-and-violence/ \r\n \r\n Autism is neurological developmental disorder. Autism is not a mental illness, nor is it a personality disorder. There is no link between autism and premeditated violence.  I am grateful to the journalists who are taking the time to clarify this. \r\n I keep hearing on the news that individuals with autism lack empathy. As a mother to a young son with autism \u2013 I do not believe this to be true. It\u2019s not empathy they lack, they lack the ability to read facial cues. So they may not understand when/if someone is sad, angry or hurt. Norrin understands these things, on the occasions he sees me crying \u2013 he\u2019ll bring me a tissue to wipe my tears. \r\n \r\n\r\nFrom Melinda Henneberger at the Washington Post\r\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2012/12/18/confusing-aspergers-with-mental-illness-and-mental-illness-with-evil/ \r\n \r\n Struggling to understand, we persist in referring to desperately sick people as evil incarnate. \u201dEvil visited this community today,\u201d said Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy. \u201dNo set of laws can eliminate evil from the world,\u201d President Obama told the grieving. \r\n A well person doesn\u2019t shoot a bunch of 6-year-olds, though, and while I believe in evil, from a Christian perspective, sin involves free will, which I\u2019m just not sure someone who acted as Lanza did was in any shape to exercise. Saying so is seen as \u201cexcusing\u201d such horrific acts, but calling illness by its modern name is important. We have so much hard work to do, and on multiple fronts, that we can\u2019t afford to set off in the wrong century. \r\n \r\nAmy Harmon at the New York Times\r\n http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/health/fearing-a-stigma-for-people-with-autism.html \r\n \r\n Amid reports from neighbors and classmates that the gunman in the shooting rampage in, Newtown, Conn., had an autism variant known as Asperger syndrome, adults with the condition and parents of children with the diagnosis are fighting what they fear may be a growing impression that it is associated with premeditated violence. \r\n ...experts say there is no evidence that they are more likely than any other group to commit violent crimes. \r\n\r\n \u201cAggression in autism spectrum disorders is almost never directed to people outside the family or immediate caregivers, is almost never planned, and almost never involves weapons,\u201d said Dr. Catherine Lord, director of the Center for Autism and the Developing Brain at NewYork-Presbyterian hospital. \u201cEach of these aspects of the current case is more common in other populations than autism.\u201d \r\n \r\nMargaret Sullivan at the New York Times\r\n http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/adam-lanza-aspergers-and-a-misleading-connection-with-violence/ \r\n \r\n  Did Adam Lanza, who authorities have identified as the gunman in Newtown, Conn., ever receive a diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s syndrome? \r\n If so, would that be relevant? \r\n And has The Times been scrupulously responsible in the way it has reported on this aspect of Friday\u2019s massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School? \r\n \r\n In brief, here are my conclusions, based on my own reading and a number of interviews and conversations this week. \r\n \r\nFrom Ron Fournier at the National Journal\r\n http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/don-t-stigmatize-asperger-s-syndrome-in-wake-of-newtown-massacre-20121216 \r\n \r\n Tyler is an Aspie. He shrugged. \u201cIf you meet somebody with Asperger\u2019s,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ve only met one person with Asperger\u2019s.\u201d \r\n Tyler's point is worth us all noting: Don\u2019t overgeneralize. Don\u2019t stigmatize in a rush to explain inexplicable evil. Autism didn't cause this tragedy: Asperger\u2019s is a blip on the far-reaching autism spectrum and no two cases are the same. Just as no \u201ctypical\u201d person deserves to be tar-brushed with the evil acts of another, Aspies don\u2019t deserve the bad press they\u2019re getting. \r\n \r\n From Bonnie Rochman at Time Magazine \r\n http://healthland.time.com/2012/12/19/guilt-by-associationtroubling-legacy-of-sandy-hook-may-be-backlash-against-children-with-autism/ \r\n \r\nAmid unconfirmed media reports that alleged gunman Adam Lanza, 20, had Asperger\u2019s, a high-functioning form of autism marked by social awkwardness, autism experts are mobilizing to combat misconceptions about the condition. Parents are reaching out to school principals to ensure that students with autism aren\u2019t being taunted. Advocates have issued statements disavowing any link between autism and premeditated aggression. And children \u2014 more often than not the siblings of kids who have autism \u2014 are standing up for others.\r\n \r\n Brenda Rothman at the Huffington Post \r\n http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brenda-rothman/autism-does-not-create_b_2332496.html \r\n \r\n But the Connecticut tragedy happened at an elementary school, like the one we went to, like the one we send our children to, a place we would all feel safe. But we still must find a difference because feeling vulnerable is too dangerous. So we look to the shooter. When we hear he was autistic, we think, \"Ah, so that's the problem.\" \r\n Except that's not the problem. Autism does not create killers. \r\n When my son was diagnosed with autism, I didn't know any autistic persons. I thought autism was a permanent lack of connection, a brain dysfunction that meant my child would never feel affection for me or for anyone else. I was so wrong. Autism is not a lack of connection. It is not a lack of affection or emotion. It's a communication disorder, sensory issues, a different schedule of development. Autistic persons have the same emotions, the same feelings of love and the same fears. \r\n \r\nJessica Jaglois at NBC12\r\n http://www.nbc12.com/story/20386590/woman-with-aspergers-defends-the-condition\r\n \r\n \r\n Paula Durbin-Westby knows what it's like to live with Asperger's. She was diagnosed in her late 40's. Since then, she's worked as an autism advocate. Since Friday's tragedy, she's had her work cut out for her. \r\n \"I don't think there's ever been this stereotype that we would go out and be mass murderers, which is very inaccurate,\" said Durbin-Westby.\r\n \r\n She says, the misinformation surrounding Asperger's is impacting children. Parents are writing from across the country her telling her about tales of bullying. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links":

But what if the upsurge is not what it appears to be? \r\n \r\n This introductory piece discussed the history of autism and gave the background on the rise in incidence. Some parts of the article were very well done...others troubling. I'll be writing more about the series; links to the pieces published to date are at the bottom. \r\n In  the comments \u00a0a woman who is a  Los Angeles-area entertainment attorney \u00a0announced than in her view, parents are seeking autism diagnoses for their children so that they can make a living from the generous  Supplementary Security Income (SSI)  paid to disabled children. \r\n No, I am not kidding. \u00a0Here's the text: \r\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n Many parents today want a diagnosis of autism spectrum for their child, not only because there is a great deal of funding allocated for services for those children, as the news article explains, but also because this qualifies the child or family to collect a good SSI payment each month. If a family can get a few kids diagnosed with such things, the family can live off the payments. This was caused because welfare payments are so low, welfare is so hard to get, and intact families with both parents present do not qualify for welfare.\u00a0 \r\n The real story would be to check out what percentage of families with child with an autism diagnose are collecting SSI. That is where you will find the real secret behind this \"epidemic.\" Also, school districts that will receive extra funding for each child with autism will be far more likely to make such a diagnosis. \r\n When I was a kid, there were kids who kept track of details, counted things, paid little attention to others, and seemed socially awkward. There were called future accountants.\u00a0 \r\n I realize there are actual cases of autism, which seems to be a form of retardation. A lot of this spectrum stuff, I think, is based on wanting to collect available funds, without regard for the fact it stigmatizes the children for life to have such a diagnosis. \r\n Anyone who writes a scathing reply should reveal if their family is collecting SSI or if they or their school is in any way collecting funds based on autism. \r\n \r\n 12/14/2011: Below, a screenshot of the comment, captured Monday morning. \u00a0Click to see full size: \r\n   \r\n Sunday, I was quite vexed reading this--it's the welfare queen with a Cadillac, autism edition, plus intense ignorance about autism--but decided to let it go. \u00a0Then today, \u00a0Sullivan wrote about the same comment at  LeftBrain/RightBrain :  Ignorance adds to Stigma Again , making the point that the rise in diagnoses is among the  well-to-do,  \u00a0not the poor. \r\n So I decided that I'd leave the \"music and film attorney\" a kind but firm comment at her  Facebook page , rather than in the LA Times comment page. \r\n It turns out that she had  already had a response  from somebody else upset by her ignorance and stigma: \r\n \r\n \u00a0just checked my messages and had a message from a woman with a fake name, with a \"husband\" with a fake name (Edgar Cayce, lol) bullying me about a Comment I wrote after a news article online. I am open to peoples' ideas, but if you want to bully me from expressing mine, get lost.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n I have no idea if the caller was using a fake name or not, or was \"bullying\". \u00a0I think not, given that the caller (not the attorney) was weeping. \r\n The entertainment attorney went on to write: \r\n \r\n lol. She said she cried when she read what I wrote and told me to get educated. I told her to go get herself educated, even read the news article. \r\n \r\n and \r\n \r\n No, seriously, this is a topic that NEEDs to be addressed. \r\n \r\n and\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Really, people are so afraid to speak reality because they might be bullied by people like this lady who messaged me. \r\n \r\n The other comments to this attorney were of the \"attorney lady you were right\" and \"the weeping woman needs to get a life\" variety. \u00a0Sigh. \u00a0Guess none of the commenters have ever had a child with a disability, or had to fight to get basic needs met. \r\n Here are 3 consecutive screenshots of the woman's now-deleted Facebook comments, captured Monday.\u00a0 \r\n   \r\n   \r\n   \r\n So I left a comment (well, two, but the first was truncated. \u00a0Danged Facebook). \r\n \r\n Hi Sue.  I read your comment yesterday at the LA times piece on autism, and was quite struck by your naivet\u00e9 about autism. \r\n To begin with, the word \"retardation\" isn't used any more.  The Arc, the largest national advocacy organization, .... [then hit return which posted comment #1.  Started over] \r\n First of all: I am not autistic, I do not have a child with autism, and I certainly have not applied for SSI for said non-existent child.  Yes the school district in which I live educates children with autism, but since it's a poor and struggling district any marginal payment hardly makes up for the marginal cost of educating said children.  I am however, and autism ally an advocate, and a co-founder and editor of The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism (TPGA).  Our webpage is here: \r\n http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/ \r\n and our Facebook page is here: \r\n http://www.facebook.com/thinkingpersonsguidetoautism \r\n Second, it is too bad you got a pseudonymous message.  However, as I said, your comment revealed an immense amount of ignorance about autism. \r\n The arc ( http://www.thearcorg/ ) now refers to \"intellectual and developmental disabilities. \r\n Autism is unrelated to retardation.  Some autistics have intellectual disabilities, but many have average or above-average intellectual capacities.  What we are finding is that even autistics with limited verbal language may have substantial intellectual ability.  I'd be glad to share the research if you'd like. \r\n On to SSI and your assertion that the autism diagnosis \"qualifies the child or family to collect a good SSI payment each month\" and that families can even \"live off the payments\" and \"A lot of this spectrum stuff, I think, is based on wanting to collect available funds.\" \r\n Your assertion is completely mistaken \r\n I wonder if you had any idea, when you wrote that, how hateful -- vitriolic even-- your assertion would appear to parents of autistic children, or adults with autism? \r\n I invite you and your readers here to come by TPGA and get to know real families dealing with autism and real adults with autism and how they live. \r\n \r\n So I posted the comment (with a link at LB/RB in  those  comments)\u00a0and went on my merry way. \u00a0Then I heard from Sullivan that the attorney had deleted my comments. \r\n verification that I indeed, posted the comments to her Facebook page. \u00a0Click to enlarge. \r\n   \r\n I went to look, and couldn't. \u00a0The entertainment attorney had blocked me from seeing her Facebook page. \u00a0 I guess I was bullying, or something. \u00a0You decide. \r\n I guess we can add to  Emily Willingham's list of things  that cause autism: the SSI gravy-train. \u00a0In case you can't tell, that's sarcasm. \r\n Update 1:  just heard from a friend: the princely sums autism parents can get from SSI, per child: the maximum is \u00a0$674 per month. \u00a0That'll let parents live large! \r\n Update 2:  \u00a0Realized after a brief poll that very few of my friends -- even friends whose children have intense autism -- receive SSI benefits, so I decided to actually, you know, poke around the SSI website. \u00a0Research. \u00a0(Don't attorneys do research? \u00a0Evidently not the one in this story.) \r\n \r\n Supplemental Security Income \r\n SSI makes monthly payments to people with low income and limited resources who are 65 or older, or blind or disabled. Your child younger than age 18 can qualify if he or she meets Social Security\u2019s definition of disability for children, and if his or her income and resources fall within the eligibility limits. The amount of the SSI payment is different from one state to another because some states add to the SSI payment. Your local Social Security office can tell you more about your state\u2019s total SSI payment. \r\n SSI Rules About Income And Resources \r\n When we decide if your child can get SSI, we consider your child\u2019s income and resources. We also consider the income and resources of family members living in the child\u2019s household. These rules apply if your child lives at home. They also apply if he or she is away at school but returns home from time to time and is subject to your control. \r\n If your child\u2019s income and resources, or the income and resources of family members living in the child\u2019s household, are more than the amount allowed, we will deny the child\u2019s application for SSI payments. \r\n We limit the monthly SSI payment to $30 when a child is in a medical facility where health insurance pays for his or her care. \r\n SSI Rules About Disability \r\n Your child must meet all of the following requirements to be considered disabled and therefore eligible for SSI: \r\n \r\n The child must not be working and earning more than $1,000 a month in 2011. (This earnings amount usually changes every year.) If he or she is working and earning that much money, we will find that your child is not disabled. \r\n The child must have a physical or mental condition, or a combination of conditions, that results in \u201cmarked and severe functional limitations.\u201d This means that the condition(s) must very seriously limit your child\u2019s activities. \r\n The child\u2019s condition(s) must have lasted, or be expected to last, at least 12 months; or must be expected to result in death. \r\n \r\nIf your child\u2019s condition(s) results in \u201cmarked and severe functional limitations\u201d for at least 12 continuous months, we will find that your child is disabled. But if it does not result in those limitations, or does not last for at least 12 months, we will find that your child is not disabled.\r\n Providing Information About Your Child\u2019s Condition \r\n When you apply for benefits for your child, we will ask you for detailed information about the child\u2019s medical condition and how it affects his or her ability to function on a daily basis. We also will ask you to give permission for the doctors, teachers, therapists and other professionals who have information about your child\u2019s condition to send the information to us. \r\n If you have any of your child\u2019s medical or school records, please bring them with you. This will help speed up the decision on your application. \r\n What Happens Next? \r\n We send all of the information you give us to the Disability Determination Services in your state. Doctors and other trained staff in that state agency will review the information, and will request your child\u2019s medical and school records, and any other information needed to decide if your child is disabled. \r\n If the state agency cannot make a disability decision using only the medical information, school records and other facts they have, they may ask you to take your child for a medical examination or test. We will pay for the exam or test. \r\n \r\n That sure reads like it's a piece of cake to get SSI for your children, or a good plan for parents to supplement their income....yes, that's sarcasm again. \r\n Links to the LA Times Series (will be updating as published): \r\n Sunday December 11 2011:  An epidemic of disease or of discovery?

Currently, we are raising money towards the creation of our first and foundational anthology ( Loud Hands: Autistic People, Speaking ) and accompanying website. \r\n Loud Hands: Autistic People, Speaking  features essays, long and short, by Autistic authors writing on autism acceptance, neurodiversity, Autistic pride and culture, disability rights and resistance, and resilience (known collectively by the community as having loud hands). Questions posed to the contributors might include  what does autism mean to you; why does Autistic culture matter; what do you wish you had known growing up Autistic; how can the Autistic community cultivate resilience; what does \"loud hands\" mean to you; and how do you have loud hands? \r\n The anthology is the first of a projected series featuring contributions from Autistic writers stressing the preservation and celebration of Autistic culture and resilience. The website will host shorter and multi-media submissions along the same lines, along with additional materials and videos, and serve as a focal point for the project and community. \r\n Our Impact: \r\n The Loud Hands Project  is about survival, resilience, and pride. The Loud Hands Project is necessary because autistic youth face systematic oppression, abuse, and bullying every day. It does not \u201cget better\u201d for us--typically, upon graduation, it actually gets worse. This must change. \r\n The Loud Hands Project  is a structured, multi-facetted response by the Autistic community to the systematic disenfranchisement, bullying, and abuse experienced by autistic youth, young adults, and self advocates. Taking the form of a publishing effort by the  Autistic Self Advocacy Network  and spearheaded by  Julia Bascom ,  The Loud Hands Project  consists of multiple prongs organized around the theme of what the Autistic community refers to as \"having loud hands\"--autism acceptance, neurodiversity, Autistic pride, community, and culture, disability rights and resistance, and resilience.  We focus on cultivating resilience among autistic young people and empowering us in building communities and cultures of ability, resistance, and worth. To quote Laura Hershey: \u201cyou weren\u2019t the one who made you ashamed, but you are the one who can make you proud.\u201d \r\n With your donation, you are helping to build a world where all people and all voices are valued and listened to. By helping to fund this project, you are supporting the Autistic community as we raise our voices, speak out, and come together to rewrite the world into one where we all can belong, be safe, be valued, and contribute. \r\n What We Need: \r\n We need to raise ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to help cover the initial costs of putting together and distributing our first anthology and launching our website. Please consider  making a donation- -every little bit helps! \r\n Other Ways You Can Help: \r\n Spread the word! Check out the share tools on our page, and please use them!

{"date": "Sunday, January 01, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t cross-posted at  The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism . \r\n My main volunteer activity this year was working on The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism,  the blog  and  the book . \r\n We published 189 posts from 114 authors, many new to Thinking Person's Guide to Autism. The complete list is below the fold.     We branched out. I started to categorize the blog posts using the section headings from the book, and realized a lot of the posts didn't exactly fit. We published a lot more posts by autistics, and more on adult issues in autism. Advocacy wasn't a heading in the book, but was a big subject this year, and into the future. Technology and research were also covered with more posts than in previous years.    Thinking Person's Guide to Autism went to, and reported on, conferences: the  International Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR) , the International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference,\u00a0 Hacking Autism's App Hackathon ,\u00a0UCSF's Developmental Disabilities Conference, and  BlogHer . \u00a0In terms of virtual events, we observed Autism Awareness Month by  posting daily , and promoted and reported on\u00a0 Autistics Speaking Day .    In 2011, our \u00a0Facebook page ( www.facebook.com/thinkingpersonsguidetoautism ) developed a lively community of its own. \u00a0We use it not just to publicize posts here, also but to put up short articles and links of interest to the community.    There were two big events here: One was the  Self-Advocate/Parent Dialogues , which began on September 19 and ran until September 30. About these conversations, TPGA editor, self-advocate, and autism parent Carol Greenburg  wrote : \r\n The thing about conflict resolution is that it requires conflict, which is messy, no matter how sensitively it's handled. Just because it's inevitable doesn't mean it's not annoying. In fact, in my experience, speaking as an individual unable to fully represent any community of any kind, the more annoying the task, the more important it is. \r\n Editor Shannon Rosa  wrote: \r\n \r\n This has been, and will continue to be, an imperfect process. It will continue to be hard work. It will also require a lot of tolerance for the mess and the imperfection, and eyes on the larger prizes of dialogue and constructive conversations. \r\nThe other big event was the long-awaited release of our book,  The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism , followed by Steven Silberman's review, naming it his \" Book of the Year .\" \r\n  What is in store for 2012? Running more wonderful posts from you, our community, and more autism advocacy.    On behalf of the entire Thinking Person's Guide to Autism editorial team, I want to express our \u00a0deep thanks and gratitude for our readers and contributors. \r\n \r\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\r\nThe Complete List of 2011 posts, in alphabetical order by last name. \u00a0( On section assignments and the ordering of the list: \u00a0the assignment to section is for some posts, arbitrary, as they might have fit in another. Interviews and transcriptions of talks are listed by the person's name, rather than the interviewer or the transcriber. \u00a0Rather than ordering the list chronologically, I chose to alphabetize by last name.)

{"date": "Thursday, January 05, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t August 25, 2012 Update:  Lea Kaydus has agreed to pay restitution \r\n January 16 2012 Update: Read this  blog post on the families affected by this scam...adorable photographs and updates on each family's search for a qualified service dog. \r\n \u00a0 Remember the Pepsi Refresh campaign? \u00a0In May, 2011 one of the projects funded was this one: LM Kaydus's Animals for Autism project: \r\n \r\n \u00a0First, L.M. Kaydus (Lea M. Kaydus), through her kennel Alaskan Snow Babies,  \u00a0was going to award one family a service dog to observe Autism Awareness Month  in April. \u00a0She sent out a press release, and evidently on her now-yanked web page, extolled the virtues of the particular breed(s) she was raising. \u00a0At the Australian blog  Can-Do-Ability : \r\n \r\n The organisation that I stumbled across is called Siberian Snow Babies. The program began many years ago, when a family, who bred and trained dogs, learnt of the impact that the dogs had on their daughter who was born with an ASD. They decided to train one of their dogs, to specifically suit her individual requirements. After doing so, her progress skyrocketed, and an organisation was born. \r\n Siberian Snow Babies, trains Siberian Husky\u2019s and Alaskan Klee Kai\u2019s. Using these two types of dogs has many benefits. They are free of any types of dog odour, which can turn some people off. They have a unique metabolism, which means they are more cost effective, when it comes to feeding them. They require less exercise than other small to medium sized dog breeds. They are highly intelligent. \r\n Dogs have been linked to sniffing out cancer and other undetectable scents, with their super sensitive noses. The Siberian Husky and the Alaskan Klee Kai who undertake training with Siberian Snow Babies, are trained to recognise a hormone in humans, called cortisol, which is released when someone is experiencing stress.... \r\n Siberian Snow Babies also offers a unique payment option, so families are able to pay off the cost of the dog over the duration of the training period, which can take one year or longer. This gives the family time to organise funds if required, through a charity for example. \r\n \r\n (aside: these claims, which may or may not be from Siberian Snow Babies, sets off alarm bells for me. \u00a0I know a bit about service dogs and dog temperament; spitz-type dogs generally aren't selected as service dogs. The  Klee Kai\u00a0 is a breed developed in the 1980s by a single breeder, who was selecting for size and temperament, not suitability as a service dog.) \r\n Then, \u00a0Kaydus, as Animals for Autism signed up to be in the May Pepsi Refresh Challenge, to raise $50,000 and award service dogs to 10 families. \u00a0Kaydus recruited prospective autism service-dog families to vote for her project: \r\n \r\n Animals for Autism emailed us 20 codes a day , sometimes more for us to use on our own computers. This went on for the entire month of May. Although I was a bit baffled by how they were coming up with so many codes, I was more than happy to help.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Many families voted enthusiastically (and made donations to Animals for Autism). Their enthusiasm was redoubled when on May 16 \u00a0 Kaydus announced the winner of the free dog offered as part of Autism Awareness Month : \r\n \r\n Hal and Amy Johnson of Brockport, New York, that their son, Rex, had been chosen as the recipient of a free Autism Service Animal! \u00a0James, the service-dog-in-training, will spend the next 12 months in an intensive program designed to meet their son's specific needs. \r\n \r\n On June 6, Kaydus announced:\u00a0 \r\n \r\n LM Kaydus, founder of Animals for Autism is pleased to announce finalist-status for a $50k grant in the Pepsi Refresh Everything Program. \u00a0All finalists will be notified by June 23 whether or not they have achieved \"winner\" status. \u00a0Should that come to fruition, up to ten (10) FREE autism service animals will be placed with children and adults in need in the United States. \r\n \r\n Families were even more excited. \u00a0Some families made down payments in the hopes that they would be selected to receive a free dog. \u00a0Donations were made to Animals for Autism on behalf of the families. \r\n On June 30, 2011, \u00a0a press release from L.M. Kaydus announced the 10 families that would receive the dogs, and said that the dogs would be placed \"in the summer of 2012\". \u00a0 \u00a0Kaydus emailed photographs of the selected puppies\u00a0 \r\n One of the  families wrote \r\n \r\n When the recipients were announced in July along with a picture of their matched puppies, each family was overwhelmingly honored and grateful for what this meant to their family.\u00a0\u00a0A lifeline had been thrown in the form of a tether to a Siberian Husky. \r\n \r\n Later in the summer, Kaydus informed the families that the terms of the grant had been changed, to allow Kaydus to build a better facility, but that the families would still receive dogs. \u00a0 This is said to be the text of the email from Pepsi Refresh to families enquiring : \r\n \r\n The original application approved in moderation was a one line budget requesting $50,000 to train autism service dogs. Because this was such a broad application and one that Global Giving (the company that runs the Pepsi Grant) could not approve for her project, they thought it would make more sense for her to use the grant funds for tangible items related to her project, including vests and collars, a physical training facility, grooming stations, and more. Her grant agreement that was signed and approved by Global Giving shows these 20+ line items. She moved her budget towards the tangible, per our request, to avoid issuing an individual a check for $25,000 to pay for less material costs, such as staff. All of these expenses for her project went both directly and indirectly towards the dog training costs. From Global Giving and Pepsi's point of view, that grantee was in compliance with her grant agreement and her original application. The story that you sent was around the original project describes exactly what GlobalGiving and Pepsi approved in our due diligence process. \r\n \r\n The Pepsi Refresh funds were disbursed to all awardees \u00a0through  Global Giving : \r\n \r\n GlobalGiving  is a charity fundraising web site that gives social entrepreneurs and non-profits from anywhere in the world a chance to raise the money that they need to improve their communities. Since 2002, GlobalGiving has raised $57,691,748 from 248,097 donors who have supported 5,202 projects. \r\n \r\n Over the summer of 2011, one of the families awarded a dog began to question the whole program. \u00a0The breed provided by Animals for Autism was not well-known to be a good service dog, the dog provided was going to be quite young, the puppies selected were promised to families before they were old enough to be evaluated for suitability as service dogs...other things just sounded hinckty. \u00a0So that family withdrew from the program .\u00a0 \r\n Others in the program also began to question. \u00a0By the fall, the wheels had come off: \r\n \r\n At the same time, Animals for Autism\u2019s website disappeared and they seemed to disappear entirely. Although they were supposed to move to a new location, nobody seemed to know where that was. We checked with the post office\u2026 no forwarding address. We checked with the animal control for the county they lived in and the county they were supposed to move to\u2026 no dogs were registered to them. We called autism agencies in the area\u2026 nobody ever heard of them. So, we contacted the IL Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau. They sent complaints on our behalf. The deadlines came and went with no response.\u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n \r\n \u00a0The family  which withdrew in August began to dig : \r\n \r\n \u00a0I have made contact with the Internal Revenue Service, the State Department of Illinois, the Illinois Attorney General, the Illinois Department of Agriculture, the Better Business Bureau of Central Illinois, Springfield Autism Resource Center, The Autism Program of Illinois, Members of Sangamon and Menard Country Animal Control, my Naval Legal Services Office (AFA ignored their letter for information), program managers for the Pepsi Refresh Everything Project \r\n \r\n The outcome? \u00a0Nada. \u00a0Zip. \u00a0Nothing. \u00a0Pepsi Refresh doesn't appear to care that they may have given out $50,000 under false premises to an individual. \u00a0Global Giving doesn't seem to care that the funds they disbursed didn't go for the project advertised. \r\n But the real bad ending is for those 10 families, who so wanted a service dog for their children with autism. \u00a0As one of the fathers  wrote in a comment : \r\n \r\n As one of the 10 families involved I can not put in the words how saddened we are about this. When several months went by without updates I started having doubts, that something so good could actually be true. It saddens me how an organization could use 10 families with autistic children to benefit only themselves and how Pepsi could just turn a cheek and not care. \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n The families awarded a service dog: \u00a0 \r\n \r\n The W. family of Springfield, Missouri \r\n \u00a0The S. family of Cedarburg, Wisconsin  \r\n The P. of Lee Center, New York  \r\n The S. \u00a0of Williamsburg, Ohio  \r\n The P. family of \u00a0 of Tallahassee, Florida \r\n The d. family of Mt.

{"date": "Sunday, July 22, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Goes number \u00a08;\u00a0 Taylor number \u00a0 \r\n Vargas DL, Nascimbene C, Krishnan C, Zimmerman AW, Pardo CA, Neuroglial activation and neuroinflammation in the brain of patients with autism. Ann Neurol. 2005 Jan;57(1):67-81. \r\n  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15546155 \r\n \r\n From a post criticizing the Burbacher study,  NotMercury writes: \r\n In an earlier study, Burbacher describes the effects of high dose mercury toxicity and specific changes within the very types of brain cells studied by the Vargas group. He reports an increase in the number of microglial cells and a steady decline in the numbers of astrocytes. These findings are completely inconsistent with data from both Vargas et al. and Rezaie et al. studies. Number of microglia does not reflect state of activation. \r\n \r\n From  a review of the bases for \"biomedical\" treatments for autism : \r\n \r\n Immune system abnormalities are inferred from increased cytokine levels in post mortem studies of autistic subjects. But the researchers themselves dispute this interpretation of their work. A key work is Vargas, 2005 that is often cited as proof that inflammation as a result of immune system abnormalities is implicated in the aetiology of autism. But the senior author in this study Carlos A. Pardo-Villamizar cautiously points out in a press release (Science Blog 2004) that, \u201cit is not yet clear whether [the immune activation] is destructive or beneficial or both.\u201d On the question of treatments he says that \u201cmuch more research would be needed to establish the validity of this approach.\u201d \r\n \r\n In 2008, the anchor author Pardo wrote as an  expert witness in the Autism Omnibus trial: \r\n \r\n These findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis of a potential toxic effect on astrocytes by neurotoxins or toxic material. \r\n \r\n and \r\n \r\n Another issue that is important to clarify is the notion that neuroinflammatory responses mediated by innate responses and neuroglial activation are directly associated with injury. At present, we are not able to conclude that these neuroglial reactions are deleterious for the central nervous system. These reactions may invoke anti-inflammatory and repairing processes as demonstrated in our study in which one potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, the transforming growth factor -1 (TGF1) was significantly present in all areas of the brain.  Other members of the same family of proteins (TGF2) were also present in the cerebrospinal fluid. So, it is erroneous to assign an exclusive deleterious or injury effect of these neuroglial responses in the CNS.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n The idea of autism as mercury poisoning goes something like this: The\u00a0thimerosal (that was removed from vaccines in 2001) \u00a0gets changed to ethyl mercury which deposits mercury ions in the brain, causing neuroinflamation which causes autism. \r\n There are many flaws in that chain of reasoning but a remarkable one is that the few world experts on autism and neuroinflammation the disagree with the contention that neuroinflamation in autistic brains is due to neurotoxins. \r\n Does this paper \"demonstrate that vaccines can cause autism\"? No.\u00a0 \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/notes/vaccination-challenge/30-scientific-studies-that-demonstrate-vaccines-can-cause-autism/259348200832913", "http://www.adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15546155", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=107", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/09/12/quackery-at-the-university-of-toronto-re/", "http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/autism/Expert%20Reports/Mead_03-215V/ExLL_Pardo-Villamizar_Letter_03-215.pdf"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/07/8-neuroglial-activation-and-neuroinflammation-in-the-brain-of-patients-with-autism-2005-.html", "title": "8.

{"date": "Tuesday, January 17, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Suppose you are an adult with a particular disability. \u00a0There are a number of national \u00a0organizations and charities whose mission is \u00a0to support your particular disability, but one is dominant, with an annual budget of over $50 million and a massive grass-roots fundraising campaign, with dozens of walks across the country engaging tens of thousands of volunteers. \u00a0However, you (and many other adults with this disability) have  profound  and\u00a0\u00a0 irreconcilable  ethical and philosophical differences with the organization's mission and goals. \r\n Suppose further that you are an author, and this organization, without your permission, has used a passage from your published works in one of their copyrighted publications. \u00a0When you ask the organization to remove the passage, they ...don't really comply. \r\n Now what can you do? \r\n This is exactly the situation that  Kassiane  finds herself with respect to Autism Speaks. Early in 2011, Autism Speaks published an on-line  \"transition tool kit\" , for autistics moving from school into adulthood. \u00a0The  first page  of the 10-page section on self-advocacy featured a quote from Kassiane's 2004 essay, \"Help Me Help Myself: Teaching and Learning Self-Advocacy\", which was published as a chapter in\u00a0\u00a0 Ask and Tell: Self-Advocacy and Disclosure for People on the Autism Spectrum ,  published by the\u00a0 Autism Asperger Publishing Company \u00a0(AAPC). (T he quoted passage is at the bottom of this post.) \r\n In Februrary 2011 Kassiane discovered the quote. She was  deeply offended : \r\n \r\n You can't yank a quote--even a good quote--and get the details about that person wrong and just use it when you know damn well they dislike you and all you stand for intensely.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n An Autism Speaks spokesperson (unidentified in the comment)  responded : \r\n \r\n Hi Kassiane \u2013 we actually did ask whether we could use the quote: the publisher gave us permission. We really liked your quote, it resonated with us and we thought that it would also particularly resonate with parents of individuals on the spectrum who were approaching adulthood. \r\n We may not see eye to eye all the time, but we do hope that you\u2019ll support our efforts to help people with this kit. Our goal with it is simply to help young individuals on the spectrum and their parents successfully navigate a particularly stressful period of their lives. \r\n \r\n \u00a0Kassiane investigated, and found that: \r\n \r\n My publisher insists no permission was given. Even though the quote was pulled (supposedly) they may have some Words.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n At some point after February 4, 2011, \u00a0the quote disappeared from the page. \u00a0All that white space is where the quote appeared ( as always, click to embiggen ): \r\n \r\n But, well, not quite. On January 14, 2012, \u00a0 A commenter wrote: \r\n \r\n go here: http://www.autismspeaks.org/docs/family_services_docs/transition/Self-Advocacy.pdf and search for Kassiane (Control F). It turns up twice although the page is blank.  Really  funny stuff! \r\n \r\n Kassiane protested and called for help: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n I responded, and sure enough, when you follow the commenter's instructions above, there it is. \u00a0All Autism Speaks did was to make the type for Kassiane's quote the same color (white) as the background. \u00a0 \r\n Here is an organization with a $50 million dollar budget, and they couldn't be bothered to re-format a 10-page PDF. \u00a0It would probably take all of 15 minutes to do it correctly. \r\n But why does Kassiane care? \u00a0After all, the words are gone, aren't they? \u00a0Well, the words are invisible to  humans,  but not to web-crawlers. \u00a0If you search for the name Kassiane is referred to on the PDF, you find that the third entry is Autism Speaks' PDF: \r\n Even worse, if you search for Kassiane + \"Autism Speaks\" it's the fifth entry: \r\n \r\n In case you need a visual of how Kassiane feels about Autism Speaks: \r\n \r\n What should Autism Speaks do? \r\n \r\n Take down the PDF, edit it so that Kassiane's words and bio are gone, and repost \r\n Apologize to Kassiane for the careless way they managed the event. \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \r\n Backstory for those who don't understand why Kassiane and many other autistic adults revile Autism Speaks,\u00a0 \r\n In 2005,  Autism Speaks  was founded, and quickly grew to a position of dominance, first by its fund-raising prowess (raising  $30 million in its first nine months ) and second by absorbing two other organizations, the  National Alliance for Autism Research  (NAAR) and  Cure Autism Now  (CAN). \u00a0 \r\n Protests against Autism Speaks began early in the organization's life. \u00a0In 2006, it released the infamous documentary \"Autism Every Day\". \u00a0Protest began as soon as the film was released, from  autism parents like Mike Stanton \u00a0and an international petition  \"Autism Speaks: Don't Speak for Us\".\u00a0 \r\n Many autistics spoke in criticism of Autism Speaks' policies and beliefs, for example: Cal Montgomery at Ragged Edge  Autistics Speak  (December 16, \u00a02005)\u00a0Amanda Baggs  Exactly Who Is Unresponsive Here?  (May 16, 2006)\u00a0 Autism Speaks/GRASP \u201carticles of understanding \u201d October 26,\u00a02006; \u00a0Michelle Dawson  Autism Every Day's Harsh Realities  (January 21, 2007) ABFH on \" Autism Speaks' Poisonous Ideas \" (July 31, 2006) \" Autism Speaks Campaign of Hate Speech \" (August 20, 2007) \u00a0\" Autism Speaks Eugenic Agenda \" (October 22, 2007)  \"Ransom Notes and Autism Speaks: Partners in Crime\" \u00a0(December 2007) \" Eradicate Autism Speaks \" (November 13, 2009). \r\n The Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN) \u00a0was founded in November of 2006, and spent its first year building organizational capacity. \u00a0In September, 2009, Autism Speaks released another  offensive \"awareness\" video, I Am Autism  (see  here for a round-up of responses \u00a0and  here for another roundup ) \u00a0This prompted  ASAN\u00a0 \u00a0to: write a letter of  protest to Autism Speaks' sponsors, donors, and supporters ;\u00a0 \u00a0organize a  petition \u00a0drive; and organize \u00a0a series of protests at various Autism Speaks fundraising events, for example:  Ohio \u00a0 Washington DC \u00a0 Boston \u00a0 Portland OR \u00a0and  New York City .\u00a0 \r\n More recently, ASAN  chapters have protested at Autism Speaks fundraising events :\u00a0 \r\n \r\n On Sunday, October 9 [2011], ASAN chapters in Central Ohio and Sacramento protested the Autism Speaks Walk Now for Autism events, with fifteen Autistic individuals and cross-disability allies protesting at the Ohio State campus and five individuals protesting in Sacramento. Protesters at both events emphasized the disparities in Autism Speaks finances. Of just over $10 million given in grants in 2010, Autism Speaks gave barely $50,000 to family services, with the rest of the grants going to research, the bulk of which is research seeking a \"cure\" for autism rather than applied research that seeks to improve problems facing Autistic people now. Other criticisms cited last year's over $2.5 million spent in salaries for its top-level officers and directors alone (and over $13 million in salaries total), and Autism Speaks's consistent failure to ensure meaningful representation of Autistic people in their leadership either locally or nationally.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Kassiane's \"whited out\" quote and bio in the Autism Speaks PDF: \r\n \r\n \"One thing autistics and parents of autistics agree upon is the desire for independence.  Many skills are taught in an effort to achieve this goal, but one of the most important is consistently neglected.  This skill is called self-advocacy. \r\n Self-advocacy is the process by which we get our wants and needs met.  If we are to be independent, we have to advocate for ourselves.  In spite of this blatant truth, few parents and professionals think to teach advocacy.  They do not teach advocacy mainly out of ignorance \u2013 it does not occur to them that a person on the spectrum needs to be shown how.  But the truth of the matter is that we do not naturally learn how to get our needs met the way typical children do. There are several reasons why autistic people tend to have poor self-advocacy skills.  First, we do not learn social patterns well, and self-advocacy is a social process.  While most neurotypical population learns to ask for things by imitation, autistics need explicit instructions.  Well-meaning adults often contribute to the problem in childhood by doing for us what we should be taught to do for ourselves, resulting in learned dependence because we do not practice the techniques of advocacy  ourselves.  The autistic theory-of-mind difference also contributes to our lack of self-advocacy skills. \u201cI know what I need; therefore, so does everyone else.\u201d \" \r\n - Help Me Help Myself: Teaching and Learning Self-Advocacy, by Kassiane Sibley from  Ask and  Tell: Self-Advocacy and Disclosure for People on the Autism Spectrum , edited by Stephen M.

Mol Psychiatry. 2004 Apr;9(4):358-70. \r\n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14745455 \r\n The 2010 Dwyer decision: \r\n \r\n [Deth's] own research, most of which was unpublished, unduplicated, or mentioned for the first time during the Theory 2 general causation hearing, was poorly performed and scientifically implausible. Based on in vitro effects of mercury on \u201cneuronal cells,\u201d he claimed that mercury had the same effects on human brain cells. \r\n \r\n Kathleen Seidel's correspondence with Deth \u00a0March 22, 2006, Deth to Seidel: \r\n \r\n I would like to make a virtual wager that within the next 18-24 months scientific evidence will make the thimerosal-autism link a near certainty. \r\n \r\n January 12, 2006  Bartholomew Cubbins on Autism: Waly et al. \r\n February 22, 2007  Kev or Sullivan at Leftbrain/Rightbrain \r\n \r\n Deth\u2019s paper, if I may quote myself, can be summed up thusly:The basic gist of the Deth paper is that various toxins, including thimerosal, affect methionine synthase activity (a process that helps in building proteins) and that this can adversely affect children. In short, the Deth paper alleges that thimerosal causes methionine synthase dysfunction (MSD). \r\n There are several issues with this as they relate to autism. Firstly, MSD and autism do not resemble each other.  Symptoms of MSD  are: Anemia, moderate to severe developmental delay, lethargy, anorexia, and homocystinuria (mental retardation, dislocation of the crystalline lens of the eye, sparse blond hair, and cardiovascular and skeletal deformities). \r\n Further issues: \r\n 1) There is no active transport mechanism into the central nervous system currently known for ethylmercury (thimerosal) whereas there is an known and active transport mechanism for methylmercury. \r\n 2) Because its half-life is much longer, methylmercury is more likely to accumulate than ethylmercury, causing higher levels of mercury in the blood. \r\n 3) Exposing cells in vitro to ethylmercury eliminates the most important difference between those two forms of mercury, and ignores the fact that ethylmercury is unlikely to enter the central nervous system at concentrations likely to be harmful. \r\n 4) The authors chose to use a cell line derived from a metastatic peripheral nervous system tumor to make predictions about developing healthy cells of the central nervous system. If the authors were interested in making claims about the developing central nervous system they should use cells derived from there. \r\n 5) The authors make statements in their introduction about developmental disorders such as fetal alcohol syndrome, Rhett\u2019s syndrome, or Fragile-X syndrome, they fail to consider the fact that all of these diseases have their origins in the developing embryo and fetus, not postnatally. \r\n 6) The authors\u2019 reference a study that evaluated the causal association between thimerosal and vaccines using the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Remember how good VAERS is? \r\n \r\n On December 30, 2007, Kathleen Seidel  published the full text of a  lengthy\u00a0 Memorandum Opinion \u00a0issued on December 21, 2007, in\u00a0 Blackwell v. Sigma Aldrich, Inc. et al. \u00a0(Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Case No. 24-C-04-004829). \u00a0In that hearing, Judge Stuart Berger excluded Deth's testimony on the following grounds: \r\n \r\n Dr. Richard Deth teaches pharmacology at Northeastern University. He was offered by the plaintiffs as an expert in the areas of physiology, neuropharmacology and the effects of thimerosal in the human brain. Dr. Deth is clearly qualified to testify as an expert witness in the areas of physiology and neuropharmacology. However, there is no recognized field of science in the third proposed area of expertise, namely \"the effects of thimerosal in the human brain.\" \r\n Dr. Deth offered the opinion that exposure to mercury for thimerosal-containing vaccines causes autism, based on a molecular theory that he developed through his in vitro studies. Questions about the effect mercury has in the human brain necessarily come within the ambit of the field of toxicology. These questions, including any opinions about the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and the excretion of thimerosal or mercury all involve issues of toxicology. \r\n Further, Dr. Deth is neither an epidemiologist, a neurologist nor a geneticist. That \u2014 vel non \u2014 would not operate to preclude his testimony. However, he has never taken any courses in epidemiology, has published no papers in any epidemiological journal, and is not a member of any epidemiological societies. He relies on an epidemiology paper published by Dr. Geier as support for his opinions. (20) Further, he relies on several papers about the neurology of autism. He is not a medical doctor and is not an expert in the field of pediatric neurology. Lastly, although he relies on various studies in the field of genetics, he does not have a degree in genetics nor is he a member of any professional genetics organizations or societies. Accordingly, in light of his expressed reliance on Dr. Geier's studies (that the Court has addressed at pp. 24-38 of this Opinion), this Court finds that he lacks a sufficient factual basis to support his testimony. \r\n \r\n On March 15, 2010, Kathleen Seidel  published lengthy extracts of the Dwyer decision \r\n \r\n The following excerpts are drawn from Special Master Denise Vowell\u2019s 310-page decision in Dwyer v. Secretary of HHS (Case No. 03-1202V), one of the three \u201cthimerosal theory\u201d test cases presented in the Omnibus Autism Proceeding. The claim was dismissed on March 12, 2010, for failure to prove that thimerosal-containing vaccines can cause autism, or that they did so in this instance. \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n On Dr. Richard Deth\u2019s testimony regarding mercury, oxidative stress and sulfur metabolism (pp. 176, 185, 192, 208, 224) \r\n Summarizing Dr. Deth\u2019s opinions on the causal role of mercury in autism is difficult. Not only were the biochemical processes allegedly affected very complex, his explanations of those processes lacked coherence. He opined that very small amounts of mercury had a scattershot effect on a number of biochemical processes, inducing systemic metabolic abnormalities and oxidative stress. He also opined that these metabolic abnormalities resulted in interference with neuronal functioning in attention and cognition, causing the major symptoms of autism. His entire hypothesis rested on a speculative \u201cgenetic susceptibility\u201d to environmental toxins, such as heavy metals in general, and mercury in particular. He asserted that children with autism have polymorphisms \u2013 variations in genes that are not considered mutations\u2014that render them more sensitive to mercury\u2019s effects by impairing their ability to eliminate ethylmercury, maintain normal oxidative and methylation balance, and maintain synchronization in neuronal signaling. The scientific studies upon which he relied provided, at best, only tangential support for his hypothesis. His own research, most of which was unpublished, unduplicated, or mentioned for the first time during the Theory 2 general causation hearing, was poorly performed and scientifically implausible. Based on in vitro effects of mercury on \u201cneuronal cells,\u201d he claimed that mercury had the same effects on human brain cells. \r\n In addition to his own unpublished research, Dr. Deth relied heavily on his one article on mercury, the Waly study. He relied on two studies conducted by Dr. S. Jill James, calling them the strongest evidence in support of his hypothesis. He also claimed that the \u201cstrongest evidence\u201d in favor of his hypothesis derived from his own unpublished work on post-mortem brain samples from individuals with ASD. \r\n Perhaps his most extravagant claim involved the quantity of mercury required to induce the claimed effects. He claimed the ability to detect the effects of mercury on cells at levels 100-1000 times lower than levels used by other researchers. He testified that mercury, in amounts at or well below the amounts contained in TCVs, could induce some individuals to enter into and remain in a state of oxidative stress. \r\n n the course of the hearing, nearly every premise of his causation theory, other than that of the ubiquity of mercury exposure in children (with or without autism), was seriously undermined, where not completely demolished. Mercury, and a number of other heavy metals, can affect cellular metabolism, but Dr. Deth\u2019s assertions that mercury does so in the manner and at the levels of exposure postulated and with the effects claimed were not scientifically supported. His assertion that oxidative stress in children with autism is causal of their autism was pure speculation. \r\n \u2026Although Dr. Deth\u2019s testimony was superficially coherent, the defects pointed out by true experts revealed the critical flaws in Dr. Deth\u2019s presentation, and, ultimately established that his hypothesis of causation was not reliable. \r\n \u2026The discovery of an extracellular methylation cycle, when all other methylation cycles take place inside cells, is so highly unusual that it warrants independent confirmation. That confirmation is lacking. The assertion in the Waly study that the D4 receptor was the site of the methylation activity was based on gel electrophoresis, but a critical failure in that process was noted by Dr. [Richard] Mailman. In view of Dr. Mailman\u2019s many publications on dopamine receptors, his testimony regarding them carries exceptional weight. \r\n As Dr. Deth had not conducted studies on human brain cells, other than his unpublished work discussed below, his testimony that human neurons lack the ability to use SAM to reactivate methionine synthase lacks scientific support. He based his findings on experiments conducted on cells with a known methionine synthase mutation. In summary, Dr. Deth and his colleagues designed an experiment around two faulty premises: the existence of the only extracellular methylation cycle, and a purported defect in human neuronal cells. In view of these problems, and the other issues noted by Drs. Jones and Mailman, any conclusions drawn from the first part of the Waly study are so unreliable as to render its evidentiary value virtually nil. \r\n \u2026Dr. Deth\u2019s late-in-the-game switch from mercury\u2019s impact on glutathione to its binding to otherwise unidentified \u201cregulatory proteins\u201d was unpersuasive. After considerable testimony about mercury\u2019s effects on transsulfuration and the methionine methylation cycle and his many experiments that purported to measure these effects, Dr. Deth\u2019s new focus on \u201cregulatory proteins\u201d was disingenuous at best. Given the ubiquity of thiols and sulfur in the brain and elsewhere in the body, the tiny amounts of mercury administered through TCVs, and the even smaller amounts that will reach and remain in the brain, are unlikely to deplete the thiols available. Most mercury in the brain is already bound, and only the small amount not already bound to thiols would be available to react with these \u201cregulatory proteins.\u201d \r\n \u2026Initially, to someone unacquainted with mercury\u2019s toxicology, ASD, or biochemistry, Dr. Deth\u2019s opinions on mercury, oxidative stress, and sulfur metabolism might appear to be solidly based and plausible. After all, mercury can be toxic to cells and is known to produce neurological injuries. Mercury does bind to glutathione, the body\u2019s primary antioxidant molecule, and thus might be expected to affect adversely the body\u2019s oxidative status. Mercury is known to bind to cysteine transporters, and thus might be expected to affect cysteine levels in cells, and thus adversely affect cells that cannot manufacture their own cysteine, such as neurons. There is evidence to indicate that mercury can cause proliferation of microglia and reductions in astrocyte numbers in at least some areas of the brain, which Dr. Deth equated to the neuroinflammation found in the brains of individuals with ASD. There is some evidence that children with ASD display biomarkers of oxidative stress in peripheral blood, and may even have some polymorphisms associated with higher levels of oxidative stress. \r\n However, when critically examined, Dr. Deth\u2019s causal assertions fall apart. Mercury, at sufficient doses, is toxic to cells, but humans are born with mercury in their brains, blood, and hair as a result of maternal exposures. Humans continue to be exposed to mercury throughout their lives, and methods for detoxifying and eliminating mercury have evolved to account for this exposure. In populations with high mercury exposure, there is no increased incidence of ASD, and thus the low levels once found in vaccines are unlikely to be a cause or a substantial contributor to the condition. Mercury, at sufficient doses, can produce neurological injuries, but not at the levels of mercury found in vaccines. The neurological injuries it produces are well established and do not resemble ASD. A comparison of autopsy findings in mercury\u2019s victims and autopsy findings from individuals with ASD do not show the same patterns of damage or injury. \r\n Dr. Deth attempted to demonstrate that vaccine levels of mercury could adversely affect sulfur metabolism and produce oxidative injury in the human brain through a series of experiments on cells in culture. He represented the cells as \u201cneuronal,\u201d although they were not neurons and had defects affecting the processes he attempted to measure. His laboratory experiments, funded largely by contributions from groups associated with the belief that vaccines cause ASD (ARI [Autism Research Institute] and SafeMinds), found adverse effects from doses of mercury between 100-10,000 times lower than those used by other researchers. Assuming, arguendo, that these experiments were properly performed and produced correct results (both points about which I am unconvinced), the experiments contribute little to nothing to the causation hypothesis. In vitro experiments on cells in culture may suggest likely avenues for further research, but the complexity of sulfur metabolism presented in Dr. Deth\u2019s testimony and report demonstrates the robust systems in place in human beings to handle oxidative stress and produce the methylated products needed for cellular functioning, including DNA expression. I note that Dr. Deth heavily relied on mercury\u2019s effects on glutathione, but the evidence overwhelmingly illustrated that glutathione levels in the body would be unaffected by vaccine level doses. \r\n Dr. Deth also relied heavily on evidence indicating that children with ASD display peripheral markers of oxidative stress, and that brains of those with ASD have evidence of neuroinflammation, which he equated to oxidative damage. He failed to mention that oxidative stress in the periphery is associated with many different diseases, but that peripheral levels do not represent brain redox status. He likewise failed to point out that neuroinflammation is found in many brain disorders and injuries, including those produced by trauma. Thus, a finding of oxidative stress or even oxidative injury says little about mercury as a probable cause of the stress or injury because there are so many other possible causes, including neuroinflammation as a response to the other pathophysiological findings in the brains of those with ASD. Since ASD is a highly genetic disorder, it is unsurprising that preliminary studies have found some polymorphisms exist in children with ASD in higher numbers than in neurotypical individuals. It is equally unsurprising that some of these polymorphisms are associated with problems in oxidation or sulfur metabolism. Children with Down syndrome, an entirely genetic disorder involving mental retardation, also have oxidative stress levels higher than neurotypical children. Children with Rett\u2019s disorder, another entirely genetic condition, have impairments in DNA methylation, a sulfur metabolism problem. The preliminary findings in children with ASD say nothing about a genetic susceptibility to mercury or even that the oxidative stress levels found actually affect mercury detoxification. \r\n Dr. Deth\u2019s own experiments were based on faulty premises regarding methylation of the D4 receptor and defects in methionine synthase activity in human neurons. His experiments detecting effects of nanomolar levels of mercury on glutathione, cysteine, methylcobalamin, and methionine synthase had so many flaws that they cannot be considered reliable as evidence. Respondent\u2019s experts in oxidative stress, sulfur metabolism, neurodegenerative disorders, and mercury pointed out the serious deficiencies in Dr. Deth\u2019s hypothesis, experiments, and conclusions. Their criticisms, coupled with the flaws in Dr. Deth\u2019s logic, his own acknowledgment that eliminating TCVs has not produced any decline in ASD rates, and the conflicts between his testimony and what is well established about mercury\u2019s toxicology, all convince me that Dr. Deth\u2019s hypothesis is not reliable, and cause me to accord his testimony and report little weight. \r\n \r\n\r\nDeth's research and the resulting paper was deeply flawed.

Neuroscientist. 2005 Oct;11(5):417-40. \r\n  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16151044 \r\n Here's the abstract for the paper: \r\n \r\n The most replicated finding in autism neuroanatomy-a tendency to unusually large brains-has seemed paradoxical in relation to the specificity of the abnormalities in three behavioral domains that define autism. We now know a range of things about this phenomenon, including that brains in autism have a growth spurt shortly after birth and then slow in growth a few short years afterward, that only younger but not older brains are larger in autism than in controls, that white matter contributes disproportionately to this volume increase and in a nonuniform pattern suggesting postnatal pathology, that functional connectivity among regions of autistic brains is diminished, and that neuroinflammation (including microgliosis and astrogliosis) appears to be present in autistic brain tissue from childhood through adulthood. Alongside these pervasive brain tissue and functional abnormalities, there have arisen theories of pervasive or widespread neural information processing or signal coordination abnormalities (such as weak central coherence, impaired complex processing, and underconnectivity), which are argued to underlie the specific observable behavioral features of autism. This convergence of findings and models suggests that a systems- and chronic disease-based reformulation of function and pathophysiology in autism needs to be considered, and it opens the possibility for new treatment targets. \r\n \r\n The paper is a review of what is known about the differences in brain development and function in autism, and concludes with Dr. Herbert's speculations on autism as a systematic condition. \r\n In October 2006, Dr. Herbert testified as an expert witness in an autism-causation case. The judge found: \r\n \r\n Dr. Herbert\u2019s publications indicate that she is an outspoken advocate of increased attention to the possibility of environmental influences. Even she, however, despite that acknowledged perspective, speaks in her published work of possibilities and potentialities, rather than of the \u2018reasonable degree of medical certainty\u2019 .... Dr. Herbert\u2019s method, to the extent the Court can discern it from the materials offered, is a series of deductions based on possibilities\u2026..Clearly, Dr. Herbert\u2019s method is not generally accepted in the scientific community. Dr. Herbert\u2019s theory of environmental triggers of autism may some day prove true.

Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2006 Jul 15;214(2):99-108. Epub 2006 Jun 16. \r\n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PMID%3A%2016782144%20 \r\n The 2006 Nataf paper caused quite a stir in the \"autism is mercury poisoning\" wing of the autism community. \u00a0The paper's essential findings were that \u00a0urinary porphyrns can give an accurate estimate of the amount of mercury in the person's body; \u00a0the levels were elevated in autistic individuals but not those with Asperger's; and that levels were \"normalized\" with an oral chelation product. \r\n There have been replications claimed in the US (a  Geier and Geier  publication) in  Australia  and  in Korea . \u00a0 \r\n A  February 2007 \u00a0review of the mercury  in vaccines and autism theory found relative to Nataf: \r\n \r\n Unfortunately the study done by Nataf et al. reported urinary porphyrin levels as a ratio to creatinine. Not only does this make actual quantification ambiguous, it exposes the results to known  inconsistencies of creatinine measurements  taken from autistic children based on spot urine collections. Furthermore, Nataf et al. apparently did not actually measure mercury. Potential weaknesses taken altogether, this study doesn\u2019t seem to provide scientific proof of [nothing]. \r\n \r\n Kev Leitch of LeftBrain/RightBrain had an email conversation with Professor Lathe (apparently the senior author) on some of the peculiarities in the paper: the role of Lorene Amet and the significance of the findings (August, 2006:\u00a0 Part I  and  Part II ). \u00a0In short,\u00a0 \r\n \r\n the shortcomings in the Porph study and Professor Lathe\u2019s reliance on extremely haphazard science. I also touched on his strange reluctance to publish  all  associated data relating to that study and his peculiar relationship with co-author and DAN! doctor Lorene Amet. I also reported on how Lathe conceded that several key aspects of his theory relied on unverified science \u2013 notably the  Holmes et al paper . \r\n \r\n In an April, 2007 post, Kev Leitch  again enumerates the weaknesses and flaws of the Nataf paper . \r\n In summary, Nataf et al. was based on very questionable science. \u00a0This paper cannot be said to \"demonstrate that vaccines can cause autism.\" \r\n Apparently the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program agreed. \u00a0The \u00a0Autism Omnibus Ruling of March 12, 2010, dismissed the mercury causation theory. \u00a0Nataf's work was mentioned in the King vs HHS case. \r\n \r\n Summary concerning \u201cgenetic hypersusceptibility\u201d and \u201cmercury efflux disorder\u201d theories (p. 60) \r\n I find that Dr. Brent\u2019s testimony concerning these issues was persuasive, and that the testimony of Dr. Aposhian was not. I conclude that the Holmes, Hu, Adams, and Bradstreet studies are of doubtful reliability, and that the contrary studies cited by Dr. Brent provide better evidence. I conclude that the Woods and Nataf articles also provide no significant support to Dr. Aposhian\u2019s theory. Accordingly, after analysis of all of the evidence in this regard, I conclude that there is no merit to the \u201cgenetic hypersusceptibility\u201d and \u201cmercury efflux disorder\u201d theories proposed by Dr. Aposhian and the petitioners. \r\n \r\n \u00a0It is useful to note that Nataf hasn't published on autism since, and Lathe seems to have moved on as well, publishing his last article on autism in 2009 \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/notes/vaccination-challenge/30-scientific-studies-that-demonstrate-vaccines-can-cause-autism/259348200832913", "http://www.adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PMID%3A%2016782144%20", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17885929", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18704827", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20391113", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=107", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16732798?dopt=AbstractPlus", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2006/08/22/professor-richard-lathe-brain-autism-and-environment-part-i-strange-bedfellows/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2006/08/26/professor-richard-lathe-brain-autism-and-environment-part-ii-strong-convictions/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12933322", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2007/04/17/lisa-sykes-and-paul-king-comed-with-a-silent-y/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/200/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/200/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/07/2porphyrinuria-in-childhood-autistic-disorder-implications-for-environmental-toxicity-2006.html", "title": "2.Porphyrinuria in childhood autistic disorder: implications for environmental toxicity.

J Toxicol Environ Health A . 2010;73:(24):1665-77. \r\n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21058170 \r\n The central claim of the paper is that \"Boys vaccinated as\u00a0neonates\u00a0had threefold greater odds for\u00a0autism\u00a0diagnosis compared to boys never vaccinated or vaccinated after the first month of life.\" \r\n As  Kev Leitch pointed out : \r\n \r\n The autism group had 33 kids total. Of these, 9 of 31 (29%) were given the HepB vaccine. Compare this to 1,258 of 7,455 (17%) of the non-autism group who were given the HepB. \r\n 9 out of 31. \r\n Are the red flags up yet? They should be. \r\n Take for example kids aged 17 in the 1997 survey. When were they born? That\u2019s right, 1980. \r\n When was the Hepatitis B vaccine introduced? 1991. According to Mr. Kirby himself, the HepB vaccine didn\u2019t get fully implemented until about 1996. \r\n A lot of the kids were born before the \u201cepidemic\u201d of autism. No one disputes that the number of people identified with autism has gone up significantly in the last 30 years. \r\n So, pretty much anything that changed in that time would \u201ccorrelate\u201d with autism. \r\n \r\n  Prometheus , a pseudonymous blogger who is a professor of biological sciences,  noted : \r\n \r\n I just did a couple of quick statistics on the data in this poster. \r\n The first thing that pops up is that the prevalence of autism in this group is 1 in 238 (in the groups with HBV data, the prevalence was 1 in 241). Seems a bit low. \r\n Secondly, there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups (HBV/no HBV) in their autism prevalence (p = 0.07). \r\n The poster gives no details about how the data was \u201ccontrolled for confounders\u201d, so it is unclear how they might have \u201cmassaged\u201d the data into significance. No matter \u2013 with no statistically significant difference between the groups, the odds ratio is meaningless. \r\n \r\n  Sullivan went on to comment  \r\n \r\n the authors found after their regression that the odds ratio for autism for non-Hispanic whites was 0.385. \r\n This is polar opposite to the administrative data (which usually shows very high \u201codds\u201d for whites) and against what actual prevalence studies show (no variation by race/ethnicity). \r\nSomething is very odd with that study. \r\n In January 2011, the paper again came up for discussion in the comments at Science-Based Medicine. \u00a0 One of the regular commenters \u00a0wrote: \r\n \r\n The key, of course, is that the premise of the article rests on the danger of thimerosal, so there are immediate problems with the mechanism by which the authors suppose the hep B vaccine is linked to autism \u2014 and predictably, in the discussion section, the authors cite the ludicrous work of the Geiers as supporting evidence for their findings. The data are drawn from the NHIH \u2014 so it\u2019s interview data with no independent confirmation of autism diagnoses, and there appears to be a lot of relevant information missing. For example, although they found about 193 cases of autism in the sample they used, only ~45 of those actually had usable vaccination records. \r\n \r\n So far, the study looks more than weak. \r\n I looked for papers published after 2010 that might replicate the results; there are none. \u00a0However, there  is  a  2011 Polish paper  that failed to find an association between thimerosal exposure from vaccines and autism. \r\n Does this paper \u00a0\"demonstrate that vaccines can cause autism\"? \u00a0No. \u00a0Not even the Hep B vaccine. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/notes/vaccination-challenge/30-scientific-studies-that-demonstrate-vaccines-can-cause-autism/259348200832913", "http://www.adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21058170", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/09/17/another-weak-study-proves-vaccines-cause-autism/", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/09/17/another-weak-study-proves-vaccines-cause-autism/comment-page-1/#comment-27536", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/09/17/another-weak-study-proves-vaccines-cause-autism/comment-page-1/#comment-27538", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/piltdown-medicine-and-andrew-wakefields-mmr-vaccine-fraud/#comment-60915", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22184954"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/07/1-hepatitis-b-vaccination-of-male-neonates-and-autism-diagnosis-nhis-1997-2002-2010.html", "title": "1.

Environ Health Perspect. 2005 Aug;113(8):1015-21.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079072 \r\n Pediatrician \"Bartholomew Cubbins\": \r\n \r\n There has been a number of people touting this paper yet only a few have really read it. Here's the paper in pictures. In short, only about half of the real experiment was done. I can't speculate why the authors stopped short, but I can say that their decision renders this paper almost worthless. \r\n \r\n Science Researcher NotMercury,  writing at Autism Street:  \r\n \r\n In an earlier study, Burbacher describes the effects of high dose mercury toxicity and specific changes within the very types of brain cells studied by the Vargas group. He reports an increase in the number of microglial cells and a steady decline in the numbers of astrocytes. These findings are completely inconsistent with data from both Vargas et al. and Rezaie et al. studies. Number of microglia does not reflect state of activation. \r\n In fact, Burbacher reported no ill health effects to monkeys when injected with thimerosal at 1990s levels. A figure, by the way, that would have little bearing on children born after 1999. Burbacher must have recognized the difficulty in obtaining thimerosal-containing vaccines when he did this study, since he chose to add thimerosal to vaccines that were never designed to contain thimerosal. Conditions may have allowed for premature dealkylation and generation of inorganic mercury species prior to injection. \r\n ....While it\u2019s true that it would have been accurate to describe thimerosal as 50% mercury by weight, molecular weight is probably meaningless in terms of toxicity (which is determined by the biological effects of a chemical compound on a given organism).  While the work of Burbacher does provide insight into the rates at which different forms of mercury are removed from a primate\u2019s brain and bloodstream. As far as proof of toxicity, or specifics of mercury actually causing autism go, conclusions based on this research, seem about a solid as a paper cup. \r\n \r\n From a later article, again by  NotMercury and Do'C \r\n \r\n The sole conclusion to be drawn from Burbacher, 2005 is, and we quote: \r\n \r\n \u201cThe results indicate that methylmercury is not a suitable reference for risk assessment from exposure to thimerosal-derived Hg.\u201d \r\n \r\n Which, when applied to Burbacher, 1996, renders any conclusions drawn from this study as irrelevant. Setting that aside for the moment, the Burbacher, 1996 study used more than 5 times the concentration of mercury before changes in brain cells were observed and those changes looked very different from those reported by Vargas, et al. \r\n So assuming that chronic exposure to methylmercury, not thimerosal, does result in an accumulation of inorganic mercury, Burbacher, 2005 shows a steady decline in the inorganic mercury fraction which never achieves levels required to induce changes in neuroglial populations that may, or may not, be associated with autism in some individuals. \r\n \r\n So.  Does this paper \"demonstrate that vaccines can cause autism\"?  No.  The double weight of flaws in the study design and the the slender conclusions of the paper do not support the vaccine-causation hypothesis. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/notes/vaccination-challenge/30-scientific-studies-that-demonstrate-vaccines-can-cause-autism/259348200832913", "http://www.adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079072", "http://bartholomewcubbins.blogspot.com/2007/01/bc-on-autism-revisiting-burbacher-2005.html", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=107", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=108"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/07/6-comparison-of-blood-and-brain-mercury-levels-in-infant-monkeys-exposed-to-methylmercury-or-vaccine.html", "title": "6.

I said that next year, for kindergarten, he\u2019ll be mainstreamed (with support), in school with 24 other students, 20 of whom are typical. I asked the panel and the audience at what point they consider becoming more anonymous when it comes to blogging about their children. I was hoping to have a discussion about protecting my son\u2019s privacy while also continuing to be honest and true to spreading special needs awareness. \r\n Ms. Campbell took great offense at what she heard Shannon say. \r\n She also didn't mention my response to what I heard her say. I don't recall my response being terribly coherent, but the points I wanted to get across were \r\n \r\n How open your are may depend upon conditions at your child's school and/or the district. I know that there are some blogging parents who have been retaliated against by their district. \r\n It's possible to have varying levels of transparency, from password-protecting your blog to using pseudonyms to being completely transparent. Each family has to make that decision, based on their particular circumstances \r\n Perhaps it's better for the child's classmates and teachers to get to know the child as he is today, rather than what he was like several years ago. Maybe those people don't need to know what he's overcome, right away. \r\n \r\n I hope Ms. Campbell takes the time to read through some of the reports of the previous BlogHer sessions, in which question she raised was addressed by many others, both from the autism community and those with other disabilities .\r\n After the break, one of the people I sat down with was  Miz Kp , who has an adorable and autistic boy. They live in New York City. I asked her a question, which she heard as : \r\n \u201cWhat can the white special needs community do to help the brown special needs community?\u201d I was asked this question at the BlogHer \u201914 Special Needs Mini Con session this past weekend in San Jose, CA. \r\n If I said it that way,-- well, I apologize. It sure sounds condescending. That set of words wasn't what was on my mind. What I had in mind was \"How does the white special needs community need to change to be more welcoming, more available to folk of color who have special needs or who are parenting special needs children?\" What comes out of my mouth isn't always what's in my mind. \r\n Miz. Kp answered the question, though, at her  Sailing Autistic Seas   blogpost,  Why Minority Voices Matter in the Autism Community   \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n I also had a chance to visit in person with Adrienne Jones, of  No Points for Style . I didn't tell her, but I didn't recognize her right away -- but she has a large and beautiful tattoo like the image to the left, that's also the icon for her blog. Suddenly as we were speaking, my brain went CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! And I said something like, it's YOU! We talked about empathy for others' struggles, and sighed of the stigmas attached to thinking disorders and emotional disorders, and different paths to emotional  differentiation .  \r\n I also traded hugs with Lexi Magnussun (formerly of her shuttered blog, Mostly True Stuff, now mostly on  Facebook (edited to add: and now at  Lexistential )  and JillSmo of Yeah Good Stuff, who looks exactly like her avatar. \r\n Edited to add: Lexi has \r\n If I find more recaps of the Special Needs Mini-con, I will post them here \r\n YIKES!

SCPA recently published a paper,\u00a0 Impacts of Environmental Factors on the Prevalence of Autistic Disorder after 1979 , by Theresa A. Deisher and colleagues. In short, SCPI has the notion that there's \"fetal DNA\" left in vaccines which use viruses grown on human cell lines. Once the vaccines are injected into humans, the alleged DNA can somehow invade neurons, recomine with the subject's DNA, and damage the neurons.\u00a0 \r\n This idea is biologically speaking,  completely implausible .\u00a0 \r\n This does not seem to deter Deisher and her company from advancing the idea, or pursuing the idea that vaccines can be made for sale without the use of human cell lines. \r\n 2014 Critiques of Deisher's ideas: \r\n Abortion, Autism and Immunization: The Danger of the Plausible Sounding Lie  by Genevieve H. at Rational Catholic (September 8, 2014) \r\n \r\n There is no plausible way that [something injected after birth could cause autism] could happen. It makes absolutely no sense with what we know to be true about autism. Even though to the layperson it sounds convincing that foreign DNA injected into a developing child could somehow go to the brain and cause autism, there is no credible way that that could actually be the case. Not with the overwhelming evidence that autism begins before birth. This is yet another in a series of plausible sounding untruths about vaccines that are so convincing to the average, intelligent parent just trying to learn more.... \r\n I do not know why the authors of this article published the conclusions that they did, or why they chose to publish their work in such a questionable publication. In no way do I want to impugn their characters or call into question what are probably deeply held beliefs on their parts.  However, deeply held beliefs do not make for rigorous scientific inquiry. And pro-life parents seeking to do the best by their children and by their culture deserve better than to have a plausible sounding lie masquerading as truth. \r\n \r\n Religious fundamentalists try to prove fetal DNA in vaccines causes autism and fail  by Orac at Respectful Insolence (September 9, 2014). This blog post goes into deep detail about the kinds of laboratory techniques used for finding RNA and DNA, and the shortcomings of Deisher's team, and then addresses the correlation issue \r\n Autism is usually diagnosed between ages 2 and 4; so, unless the power of these evil tainted vaccines to contaminate the DNA of our precious children can also travel back in time, it\u2019s hard to take correlations between these change points and vaccine introduction as anything more than spurious pseudo-correlations. It would be so hilarious if the consequences of such fear mongering weren\u2019t so dire, although even then it\u2019s still useful as a cautionary tale worthy of extreme mockery of how not to do linear regression and inflection point \u201chockey stick\u201d analysis. \r\n Dr. Deisher, vaccines and autism: three red flags , by Simcha Fisher at Patheos (September 11, 2014) \r\n \r\n Deisher commits the cardinal sin of scientific research: she confuses correlation with causation. There is even some question whether even the correlation she posits actually exists. \r\n This is bad science.... \r\n But if we are going to hesitate over any vaccine, let it be for medically and theologically sound reasons. Dr. Deisher has not provided either. Her study displays a conflict of interest; it banks on an emotional response to an ethical question; and most damningly, it relies on heavily flawed science. Catholics should keep their eyes open for other scientists whose research is sound. \r\n \r\n Problems with Deisher\u2019s study\u2014 Part I: The numbers  by Laura C. at Rational Catholic (September 12, 2014) \r\n \r\n If someone were to ask me to critically appraise the scientific merits of a study arguing that birth control usage caused earthquakes by changing the mating behaviors of fish, I might have had an easier time than I did with Dr. Theresa Deisher\u2019s widely shared study. That may be over the top, but it is kind of true. In such a scenario, I would have been able to say to myself, like most other people in the scientific blogosphere are doing with the Deisher study, \u201cThis is just too absurd, too poorly done to waste any more time refuting it!\u201d But, I can\u2019t do that because you, my brothers and sisters in Christ, deserve to know how badly you are being deceived by a study that is so abominable, it would be an insult to bad science to call it bad science. \r\n [in-depth analysis of Deisher's statistical failings] \r\n Stay tuned for criticism of the biological plausibility and synthesis of Deisher\u2019s conclusions\u2026 \r\n \r\n Looking a little closer at the numbers\u2014 A supplement to Part I  by Laura C. at Rational Catholic (September 17, 2014) \r\n There are some things I want to make perfectly clear: I chose to operate under many of Deisher\u2019s assumptions that I knew weren\u2019t particularly or necessarily valid because I didn\u2019t need to exit that paradigm to point out the flaws in the rationale. However, there are more reasons to think Deisher\u2019s analysis is flawed from the outset and I\u2019d like to address just a few. \r\n Autism And Stem-Cell Derived Vaccines: Deisher\u2019s New Paper , by Matt Briggs at William M. Briggs (September 18, 2014) \r\n We\u2019re finally back to Deisher, who from her paper does not appear to appreciate these and similar points. I find the paper poor in conception, argument, and quality, and regard her main contention as unproved (which is logically consistent with  it is still possibly true ). \r\n Vaccines and Autism: This is Starting to Get Really Weird  by Joseph Moore at Yard Sale of the Mind (September 19, 2013)--Evidently, feelings about Deisher and her paper, pro and con, are running quite high in a segment of the blogosphere I can best describe as Roman Catholics doing science. Mr. Moore describes. \r\n Problems with Deisher\u2019s Study\u2014 Part II: Biological Implausibility  by Laura C. at Rational Catholic (September 24, 2014) \r\n \r\n Deisher\u2019s study is incredibly, incredibly thin in the realm of biological plausibility. This is surprising (or not) because she is making some novel, extraordinary claims. Yes, she has a nice bibliography salad, but the studies she cites do not directly, or even indirectly at times, support her central hypothesis that DNA from fetal cell lines is a direct environmental cause for increasing autistic disorder (AD) diagnoses. Further, even her unpublished research that has been cited in newsletters and pro-life media means very little in terms of the hypothesis. \r\n \r\n   Autism and The Sins of the Fathers  by anonymous blogger at Pentimento (September 27, 2014) \r\n\r\n \r\nThe takeaway from Deisher's study -- at least as it's being expressed throughout the Catholic blogosphere -- is that autism must be cured (if not eliminated), and that, in fact, autism can be avoided (if not eliminated) if the rubella vaccine, which was derived from the stem cell line of an aborted baby more than fifty years ago, is no longer used. This assumes that autism is a Very Bad Thing, devoutly to be un-wished for, and that it's worth risking the deaths of countless babies (other people's babies; it always is) in utero to avoid it. This is not just theologically faulty; it's morally faulty.\r\n \r\n Previous critiques of Deisher's work and assumptions \r\n A Fishing Expedition at the Vaccine Court , by Sullivan (Matt Carey) at LeftBrainRightBrain Autism (July 14, 2013) \r\n \r\n [Deisher] did however, apply for an NIH grant to perform this research. The petitioners claim that the controversial nature of the study resulted in it not being funded. The referee reports, however, were clear that the planned study was weak and Ms. Deisher\u2019s skills were not strong in epidemiology and statistics (among other weak points). \r\n \r\n Although petitioners make assertions to the contrary, the evidentiary record before the undersigned contains a withering assessment of Dr. Deisher\u2019s ability to competently lead the proposed study. Petitioners here seek extraordinary relief, and the undersigned is reluctant to substitute her scientific judgment for that of the NIH reviewers\u2014a panel of Dr. Deisher\u2019s peers\u2014who have found her proposed study to be critically deficient. In the undersigned\u2019s view, the NIH reviewers\u2019 comments merit weighted consideration. \r\n \r\n Ms. Deisher\u2019s previous research has focused on \"changepoint\u201d analysis of autism prevalence data. She follows the method set forth by two people at the FDA who presented  such a changepoint analysis previously .  I found that analysis lacking  and submitted a comment to the journal on it. I find Ms. Deisher\u2019s analysis lacking as well. \r\n \r\n Iterative Hockey Stick Analysis? Gimme a break!  By Mark Chu-Carroll at Good Math, Bad Math (April 29, 2010). In this post, Chu-Carroll analyzes the presentation of Sound Choice Pharmaceutical Institute's data, from a company publication. \r\n \r\n Let\u2019s summarize the problems here. \r\n \r\n They\u2019re using an iterative line-matching technique which is, at best, questionable. \r\n They\u2019re applying it to a dataset that is orders of magnitude too small to be able to generate a meaningful result for a single slope change, but they use it to identify three different slope changes. \r\n They use mixed datasets that measure different things in different ways, without any sort of meta-analysis to reconcile them. \r\n One of the supposed changes occurs at the point of changeover in the datasets. \r\n When one of their datasets shows a decrease in the slope, but another shows an increase, they arbitrarily choose the one that shows an increase. \r\n \r\n Thermonuclear stupid about vaccines from someone other than Jenny McCarthy , by Orac at Respectful Insolence (July 22, 2009) \r\n \r\n ....[Deisher's argument] doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, strictly from the standpoint of a temporal correlation. After all, these cell lines were derived over 40 years ago. If there was a correlation between DNA from these cells in vaccines and autism (or any other of the problems blamed on vaccines), wouldn\u2019t it have started decades before the early 1990s? \r\n .... why this doesn\u2019t happen frequently from the many viruses humans are exposed to each and every day or after a blood transfusion. Or what about childbirth? There is almost always some mixing of fetal blood with the mother\u2019s blood upon childbirth, meaning that the mother is exposed to fetal DNA from white blood cells and monocytes in the fetal blood. Why is it that mothers don\u2019t all get anti-DNA autoimmune diseases after childbirth? \r\n \r\n Note:  It is true that Deisher spent from  1980 to 1990 as a student at Stanford University , first as an undergraduate and then as a PhD candidate in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology. However, she has not been associated in any way with Stanford for 24 years, so any publication referring to her as a \"Stanford scientist\" should be viewed with deep suspicion.

The gist of the paper is that vaccination with MMR was similar for the 624 autistic children and the 1824 non-autistic children. The paper was one more piece in the wall that reads: \"vaccination does not cause autism.\" \r\n The authors were: DeStefano F, Bhasin TK, Thompson WW, Yeargin-Allsopp M, Boyle C. \r\n Here is a photograph of Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, MD. This will become important later; you will see why. ( More about Dr. Yeargin-Allsopp ; link to her  95 published papers .) \r\n Another author was \"Thompson WW\", or  William W. Thompson , also a CDC researcher. \r\n Thompson WW has been a co-author with Destefano F on  nine other papers, dating back to 2000. . The most recent co-authored paper is the 2013 paper,  Number of antigens in early childhood vaccines and neuropsychological outcomes at age 7-10\u2009years. \r\n The 2004 paper was the only time Thompson WW was a co-author with Yeargin-Allsopp M. \r\n This brings us to the present. There is a biochemist named Brian Hooker, PhD, who has an autistic son.  Dr. Hooker is convinced  (in face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary) that thimerosal in the vaccines caused his son's autism. \u00a0Hooker has filed numerous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) suits to  compel the CDC to release allegedly damning evidence. \u00a0 There was a long and confusing brouhaha ( one ,  two , three,  four ,  five ,  six ) over the anti-vaccine movement's strategizing, and Hooker's involvement, in the run-up to the November 29 2012  Congressional Autism Hearing , chaired by Rep. Issa ( another report on the hearing ). The short version: Hooker is not an unbiased scientist; he's a man with an agenda: to prove that somehow, someway that vaccines cause autism; the CDC knew this as early as 2000; and that people at CDC have concealed data with malicious intent. \r\n On August 8, 2014, Hooker published his latest paper, \"Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination timing and autism among young African American boys: A reanalysis of CDC data\". This paper re-analyzed the dataset (designed as for a case-control study) used in deStefano paper, using a cohort methodology and a different and less subtle statistical test. This is technical stuff, but it's critical to the validity of Hooker's findings. What Hooker claims to have found: \"\u00a0a 3.36-fold increased risk for autism in African-American males who received MMR vaccination before the age of 36 months\" \u00a0 \r\n The anti-vaccine front group,  Focus Autism , published a press release on the Hooker paper, including the following claims: \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\r\n \r\n According to Dr. Hooker, the CDC whistleblower informant -- who wishes to remain anonymous -- guided him to evidence that a statistically significant relationship between the age the MMR vaccine was first given and autism incidence in African-American boys was hidden by CDC researchers. After data were gathered on 2,583 children living in Atlanta, Georgia who were born between 1986 and 1993, CDC researchers excluded children that did not have a valid State of Georgia birth certificate -- reducing the sample size being studied by 41%. Hooker explains that by introducing this arbitrary criteria into the analysis, the cohort size was sharply reduced, eliminating the statistical power of the findings and negating the strong MMR-autism link in African American boys. \r\n Dr. Hooker has worked closely with the CDC whistleblower, and he viewed highly sensitive documents related to the study via Congressional request from U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The CDC documents from Congress and discussions that Hooker had with the whistleblower reveal widespread manipulation of scientific data and top-down pressure on CDC scientists to support fraudulent application of government policies on vaccine safety. Based on raw data used in the 2004 DeStefano et al study obtained under FOIA, Dr. Hooker found that the link between MMR vaccination and autism in African-American boys was obscured by the introduction of irrelevant and unnecessary birth certificate criteria -- ostensibly to reduce the size of the study. \r\n \r\n Remember that one of the authors of the Destefano paper is an African-American woman. Hooker is labeling her a race traitor.\u00a0 On August 19, 2014 \"Autism Media Channel\" published a YouTube video,  CDC Whistleblower Confesses to Autism-Vaccine Fraud.  This video features one Andrew Jeremy Wakefield, claiming that Hooker was motivated to undertake his research because he was contacted by an unnamed, but remorseful CDC researcher. \r\n On August 22, 2014, Autism Media Channel published a second YouTube video,  CDC Whistleblower Revealed . In this video, the identity of the CDC researcher was revealed: William W. Thompson.\u00a0The Autism Media Channel videos, narrated by Wakefield, are quite inflammatory in tone.\u00a0 Wakefield compared the alleged coverup (to which Dr.\u00a0Yeargin-Allsopp would have had to been a party) to the infamous  Tuskegee syphilis experiments , and in a later passage, to\u00a0 \r\n \r\n \"You see, vile as the crimes of Stalin, Pol Pot and Hitler were, these men were not hypocrites.... These men were not entrusted with the welfare of their victims. Their mottos did not include the words, 'To save lives and protect.' They were not running a mandatory program disguised as caring. \r\n \"How many children? How many went to the wall in that decade of silence? How many Presidents, Mr. Obama?\" \r\n \r\n There are several distinct issues: \r\n \r\n The quality of the Hooker paper on its own merits. That is, what is the quality of Hooker's reanalysis? In other words, is there any there there? \r\n Let's say Thompson had legitimate concerns about the Destefano paper, especially with respect to an effect of the MMR on African American male toddlers. Is there any other plausible way that Thompson could have addressed his concerns?\u00a0 \r\n The \"whistleblower\" aspect. The story behind Hooker's reanalysis of the Destefano dataset is the claim that Thompson contacted Hooker to reveal \"secret knowledge\" -- that the CDC covered up data -- and that Hooker was the best person for this \"whistleblowing\" to go on. \r\n Turning back to the Hooker paper, is there any legitimacy to Hooker's claims that one, some subjects were improperly excluded; and two, unneccessary variables from the birth certificates were used to obscure real risks.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n With respect to the first and fourth issues, a really thorough examination of Hooker's paper would require access to the CDC dataset  and \u00a0 Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval  and  funding for such a study.\u00a0 \r\n With respect to the second point. \u00a0\u00a0For scientists in a given field such as epidemiology, there would be many channels to get a message out that there was a statistically significant signal that wasn't reported in a paper, such as the claim about the Destefano paper. \u00a0If you are an author on the paper, you could \u00a0talk to a lot of people at any conference you go to, or pick up the phone and call a colleague at a different institution. You could say, \"Hey, I know this is tough, but I need someone to get the word out on this so I can get a follow up study funded and put this question which really bothers me to rest. Would you please help me out?\" \r\n With respect to the third point: we will have to await further revelations. \r\n Posts discussing Hooker's allegations, excluding anti-vaccine sources (I will be updating these silently as new posts appear). \r\n Timeline \r\n August 8, 2014: Hooker paper published online \r\n August 18, 2014: Focus Autism Press Release published online \r\n August 18, 2014: Andrew Wakefield's Autism Media Channel Video Alleging a CDC Whistleblower published online \r\n August 22, 2014: Andrew Wakefield's Autism Media Channel Video Naming William W. Thompson as \"The CDC Whistleblower \" published online \r\n \r\n August 22, 2014, \u00a0Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence : \u00a0Brian Hooker proves Andrew Wakefield wrong about vaccines and autism \r\n Of course, the key finding in Brian Hooker\u2019s paper is that Wakefield was wrong. Indeed, in this video, Wakefield even admits that he was mostly wrong about MMR and autism. Let that sink in again. He admits that he was mostly wrong about MMR and autism. OK, he says we were \u201cpartially right,\u201d but the flip side of that is that he must have been mostly wrong. \r\n \r\n August 22, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog:\u00a0 Andrew Jeremy Wakefield plays video director while African-American Babies die, or something \r\n Hooker is wrong in his assertions because the DeStefano paper did not leave out African-American children on purpose. Children were excluded from the analysis because of very legitimate and scientific reasons. They either were not the right age, did not have autism but some other neurodevelopment disorder, or were born outside of Georgia. Even if they were tossed into the analysis, DeStefano et al used a statistical analysis that took into account things like birth weight and mother\u2019s age when analysing the data. They wanted to make sure that what they were seeing was most likely because of the MMR vaccine and not because of some other factor associated with autism. \r\n \r\n August 23, 2014, \u00a0Ren at Epidemiological:\u00a0 Directed Acyclic Graphs and the MMR vaccine doesn\u2019t cause autism .\r\n I\u2019m very skeptical that Dr. Hooker\u2019s simplified statistical approach can be better than DeStefano et al\u2019s approach of conditional logistic regression. Conditional logistic regression has the advantage of being able to control for a multitude of confounders and effect modifiers. \r\n \r\n August 24, 2014, Liz Ditz at I Speak of Dreams:\u00a0 L'affaire CDC-MMR: Hooker, Wakefield, and Focus Autism Accuse African-American Senior CDC Researcher of Being A Race Traitor \r\n According to Hooker, Wakefield, and Focus Autism, a respected senior African-American physician-researcher is a race traitor and a mass murderer. \r\n \r\n August 25, 2014, Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence:\u00a0 The central conspiracy theory of the antivaccine movement \u00a0\r\n I can imagine three main possibilities for what happened. The first possibility from what I know is that Thompson had some sort of disagreement with his co-investigators, made the incredibly stupid\u2014yes, stupid\u2014decision to unburden himself to Brian Hooker, who, he must have known or should have known, is an antivaccine crank associated with Andrew Wakefield, and is now paying the price for that decision... The second possibility is that Thompson wanted to correct something Hooker was doing with the data and somehow let himself be drawn into saying things that could easily be taken out of context. The third, and (I hope) much less likely, possibility is that Thompson\u2019s gone off the deep end and gone antivaccine. \r\n \r\n August 25,2014, David Gorski MD at Science Based Medicine:  Did a high ranking whistleblower really reveal that the CDC covered up proof that vaccines cause autism in African-American boys? \r\n \"What [Hooker] has done, apparently, is found grist for a perfect conspiracy theory to demonize the CDC, play the race card in a truly despicable fashion, and cast fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the CDC vaccination program, knowing that most of the white antivaccine activists who support hate the CDC so much that they won\u2019t notice that even Hooker\u2019s reanalysis doesn\u2019t support their belief that vaccines caused the autism in their children. Meanwhile, there is no evidence, at least none, submitted by the antivaccine propagandists flogging this conspiracy theory, that there really was a CDC conspiracy to hide anything. \r\n \r\n August 25, 2014, ToddW at Harpocrates Speaks,  Andrew Wakefield Tortures History  \r\n I want to focus on some statements made by one Andrew Wakefield, the British doctor who committed scientific fraud, resulting in the full retraction of his 1998 case series study on MMR and the stripping of his medical license. Wakefield boldly added himself to the list of not only torturing science, but now adds to his accomplishments torturing history and ethics (granted, we already knew he was ethically challenged). You see, in his videos (here and here) about the alleged \"whistleblower\", William Thompson,Wakefield compared the purported \"cover-up\" to the Tuskegee syphilis debacle. It's a false comparison used simply to inflame people and claim the race card. \r\n \r\n August 25, 2014, Michael Simpson at Skeptical Raptor,  Great CDC Coverup\u2013suppressing evidence that MMR vaccines cause autism? \u00a0cross-posted at \u00a0at Daily Kos \r\n It\u2019s clear what\u2019s happening here. Thompson, through sheer ignorance or total incompetence may have had a conversation with Hooker. Given the fact that the antivaccination gang lacks any serious scientific evidence supporting their dogma that vaccines cause autism, they jump on anything, however tenuous, that makes it appear that all of the evidence that refutes their dogma should be thrown in the garbage. \r\n \r\n August 26, 2014, Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence:  Hey, where is everybody? The \u201cCDC whistleblower\u201d manufactroversy continues apace \r\n Here it is, Tuesday already, and the antivaccine underground is still on full mental jacket alert over the biggest story the antivaccine movement has seen in a while. Fortunately, it\u2019s a story that\u2019s been largely ignored by the mainstream media, which tells me that maybe, just maybe, the mainstream media has figured out that it shouldn\u2019t give undue credence to cranks. \r\n \r\n August 26 2014, Sullivan (Matt Carey) at LeftBrainRightBrain Autism, Atlanta,  MMR: serious questions and also how Brian Hooker and Andrew Wakefield are causing damage to the autism communties \r\n A study relying largely on a small group of subjects (about 20) with the conclusion that more work is needed. Sounds vaguely familiar. And, as we will see, Mr. Hooker has teamed up with Andrew Wakefield to put out a video where they jump past the whole  this indicates more research is needed  through  this is absolute evidence of MMR causing autism  directly to  the CDC are engaging in a racist experiment sacrificing children to autism.  It\u2019s like the events around Mr. Wakefield\u2019s 1997 Lancet paper cranked up to 11. \r\n \r\n August 26 2014,Lisa Lightner at Grounded Parents:  the CDC vaccines/autism/coverup theory {spoiler alert-it\u2019s not true!} \r\n \r\n a friend, a friend that I consider to be intelligent and reasonable\u2026.first posted a link to a CNN article. Correction\u2013it\u2019s iCNN\u2026which is VERY different. ANYONE can post ANYTHING there. You can, really. It\u2019s a crowdsourcing platform. Shame on you CNN for whoring out your name for page views. Because this is what happens\u2013people will post just about anything..... \r\n I wish we knew the causes of autism, I really do. But vaccines ain\u2019t it. \r\n Fear sells, don\u2019t buy it. \r\n \r\n \r\n August 26, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog:  How to end a scientist\u2019s career with some fancy editing \r\n As much as the anti-vaccine activists have been demanding that Dr. Thompson come out into the open and make some sort of a statement, no one seems to demand that Andrew Jeremy Wakefield and his team publish the entire recorded conversation between Brian Hooker and Dr. Thompson. All we get are lies and innuendo. We have operatives like Ginger Taylor writing on Twitter that CDC deliberately didn\u2019t look at birth certificates for African-American babies in the DeStefano study. \r\n August 26, 2014: Anti-Vaccine Group The Thinking Mom's Revolution Hosts a #CDCWhistleblower Twitter Party \r\n \r\n August 27, 2014 Karoli Kuns at Crooks and Liars:  Rob Schneider's Anti-Vax Crusade Now Enters Alex Jones Territory \r\n There's nothing like a good conspiracy theory to get the creative juices flowing. For actor Rob Schneider, that means getting your dander up over your incorrect belief that the CDC altered data to bury the \"fact\" that MMR causes autism. \r\n \r\n August 27 2014, Sullivan (Matt Carey) at LeftBrainRightBrain Autism:  Discussions of the recent MMR/autism paper (and why the study isn\u2019t what the author wants you to believe it is) \r\n Below are a selected list of discussions about Brian Hooker\u2019s recent paper and the highly irresponsible way he and his team are promoting it. Let me know if you spot one I should add to the list. \r\n \r\n August 27, 2014, \u00a0Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence:  The CDC \u201cwhistleblower\u201d manufactroversy: Twitter parties and another \u201cbombshell\u201d e-mail \r\n ... just how desperate the antivaccine movement is to have Brian Hooker\u2019s incompetent \u201creanalysis\u201d of a ten year old vaccine safety study and Andrew Wakefield\u2019s despicable race-baiting video gain traction in the mainstream media. The failure of this conspiracy theory to do so is driving antivaccine activists into ever-greater fits of lunacy online. \r\n \r\n August 27, 2014, Phil Plait at Bad Astronomy, Slate:  No, There Still Is No Connection Between Vaccines and Autism \r\n There's a conspiracy theory going around that the CDC covered up a link between autism and vaccines. From what I can tell, this conspiracy theory is on the same level as the one that NASA faked the Moon landings. And you know how I feel about  that. \r\n \r\n August 27, 2014, ToddW at Harpocrates Speaks,  Anti-vaccine Activists Throw Twitter Tantrum \r\n ... the hashtag #CDCwhistleblower to do what really amounted to the social media equivalent of a temper tantrum, whining about how the mainstream media is not reporting on the study. It was really a sad display, as they simply all copied and pasted from the same list of talking points, not even adding their own interpretation. \r\n August 27, 2014, in the morning: The Journal Translational Neurodegeneration removes Hooker's paper from the public domain \r\n \r\n August 27 2014, Sullivan (Matt Carey) at LeftBrainRightBrain Autism: The Brian Hooker article \u201c\u2026has been removed from the public domain because of serious concerns about the validity of its conclusions\u201d \r\n August 27, 2014, Adam Marcus at Retraction Watch:  Journal takes down autism-vaccine paper pending investigation \r\n An article purporting to find that black children are at substantially increased risk for autism after early exposure to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine has been shelved, amid claims that a CDC whistleblower has accused health officials of suppressing information about the link. \r\n \r\n August 27, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog: Even the bottom-feeding journals seem to have some sense\r\n \u2019m still left wondering how this paper got through peer review, or who did the peer review. They seem to not have bothered with checking the biostatistics or with looking back at the DeStefano paper. \r\n A ugust 27, 2014, at approximately 2:30 pm, PDT, attorneys for William W. Thompson, the CDC employee,  publish Thompson's statement \r\n \r\n August 27, 2014: Ren at Epidemiological  Dr. Brian S. Hooker gets the Andrew Wakefield treatment .\r\n My problem with Dr. Thompson\u2019s statement is that the data were not omitted willy-nilly. There was a protocol that was established, and it excluded from the analysis children of different ethnicities, not just African Americans. In that exclusion, a vaccine-autism signal that was confounded by different factors was lost. It wasn\u2019t lost out of bias but out of properly adjusting for different factors. \r\n \r\n August 27, 2014, Debra Goldschmidt, CNN,  Journal questions validity of autism and vaccine study \r\n Dr. Frank DeStefano, lead author of the 2004 study, said he and his colleagues stand by their findings. DeStefano said all the study authors, including Thompson, agreed on the analysis and interpretation before the study was submitted for publication 10 years ago. However, he said he plans to review his notes and will decide whether to run another analysis on the data. \r\n \r\n August 28, 2014, Sullivan at LeftbrainRightBrain  Andrew Wakefield betrays another \u201cwhistleblower\u201d with Brian Hooker helping \r\n Apparently Mr. Hooker is unaware that the secrecy of confession is absolute. Priests, real ones, not self appointed ones like Mr. Hooker, have been known to go to jail rather than divulge what they\u2019ve been told in confession. Real priests don\u2019t record confessions so they can betray another. \r\n \r\n August 28, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog,  Autism is not death, unless you want it to be  \r\n While the black ribbon can mean different things to different people, it\u2019s main use is for grieving or remembering the fallen, the dead. The way that these people have used it is to try to bring attention to their cause by equating autism with a death or a loss. \r\n \r\n August 28, 2014, ToddW at Harpocrates Speaks: CDC Whistleblower William Thompson Breaks Silence\r\n Thompson's statement certainly casts Wakefield/Hooker in a not all that surprising light. At the very least, it calls into question their claims and behavior. But it does not exonerate Thompson, either. Despite his claims that he supports vaccination and that he would not suggest parents avoid immunizing their children, Thompson's actions were incredibly irresponsible. \r\n \r\n August 28, 2014, Orac at Respectful Insolence  A bad day for antivaccinationists: A possible retraction, and the \u201cCDC whistleblower\u201d issues a statement \r\n Betrayals within betrayals. This can\u2019t all be laid on Wakefield. Thompson was played. Big time. \r\n \r\n August 28,2014, Mike Siegel at Mike's Meandering Mind:  Mathematical Malpractice Watch: Torturing the Data \r\n You can\u2019t pick and choose little bits of data to support your theory. You have to be able to account for all of it. And you have to be aware of how often spurious results pop up even in the most objective and well-designed studies, especially when you parse the data finer and finer. \r\n \r\n August 28, 2014, Ari Brown MD at Parents   Vaccines. Autism. Are We Done With This Yet? \r\n What makes good science? Independent researchers study the same hypothesis and draw the same conclusions. The study in question came out in 2004, and was certainly not the only or definitive study done on the safety of the MMR vaccine. Believe me, the MMR vaccine has been studied repeatedly by researchers all over the world since the Modern Vaccine War began in 1998. Good science shows there is no association between the MMR vaccine and autism. Period. \r\n \r\n August 28, 2014, Alice Park at Time.com:  Whistleblower Claims CDC Covered Up Data Showing Vaccine-Autism Link\"> \r\n ...any time scientists take the original population of participants in a study, however large, and drill down to analyze trends in a subgroup \u2013 in this case the African-American boys \u2013 the power of the associations they find dwindles. \r\n \r\n August 28, 2014, Liz Klimas at The Blaze:  Researcher Says CDC \u2018Chose to Cover Up\u2019 Data Linking Autism With Vaccines\u2026but There\u2019s More to the Story \r\n However, the CDC and other researchers in the field defend the initial presentation of the data and even call into question the analysis conducted in Hooker\u2019s study. \r\n \r\n August 29, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog:  Working in the Quote Mine \r\n \r\n Of course, the moms are not the only ones lying by omission about this whole thing. Plenty of anti-vaccine people online have been flooding comments sections of blogs with falsehoods. They say that data were omitted when they weren\u2019t. Others said that Dr. Thompson was escorted off the CDC campus when was not. And, of course, the loonier of the loons are blaming everything from the Illuminati to the Reptilians for this. \r\n The worst of the worst, however, keep using racially-charged language over this, and they keep stoking something that I\u2019m sure not even they want to see catch on fire. \r\n \r\n \r\n August 29, 2014, Orac at Respectful Insolence:  The CDC whistleblower William W. Thompson: Final (for now) roundup and epilogue \r\n I conclude as I began, by asking \u201cWhat now?\u201d It\u2019s obvious that the antivaccine contingent will flog this story for all it\u2019s worth as long as they can, but fortunately the mainstream press doesn\u2019t appear to be getting the message. It\u2019s also clear that Hooker will continue to crank out incompetently performed epidemiological papers that torture the data until they confess a relationship between vaccines and autism \r\n \r\n August 31, 2014, Amanda Z. Naprawa at The Vaccine Advocate:  Whistleblowers and Story Tellers \r\n Ok. So we have a study by several epidemiologists in 2004 that concludes MMR does not cause autism. Then we have a 2014 study (under investigation by the journal that published it) by a biochemical engineer that reviews the same data and finds a connection for African-American boys. And this reanalysis is undertaken by a guy who has an agenda. I\u2019m no epidemiologist, but I know that researcher bias is a big fat red flag when looking at the reliability and validity of a study. And moreover, his study had a different design than the original one which can, naturally, lead to different results. So based on this, we have to question his findings. But what is important to note, is that even Hooker can\u2019t find a relationship between vaccines and autism in most children. Just black boys. And even for them: there\u2019s no relationship between getting the vaccine and autism. Just between the ages of 24 and 36 months. \r\n \r\n August 31, 2014, Dov Michaeli at The Doctor Weighs In:  Liars, Damn Liars, and Statistics: The Autism-Vaccine Fraud  \r\n What\u2019s wrong with this paper? Statistics, for starters. Post-hoc subgroup analysis is fraught with risks too numerous to detail here. Suffice it to say that confounding factors fall into the \u201cknown unknowns\u201d and \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d categories. Multiple logistic regression analysis can can ferret some, but not all, such problems. It is puzzling then that Hooker chose to use extremely simplified contingency statistics (chi square) that are far more prone to false positives, since they\u2019re less capable of isolating out confounding factors than the multiple logistic regression. \r\n \r\n August 31, 2014, Sullivan at LeftBrainRightBrain:  Comment on: Expression of Concern: Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination timing and autism among young African American boys: a reanalysis of CDC data \r\n In this case, it isn\u2019t that Mr. Hooker\u2019s decisions are poor (they are), it\u2019s that his choices show that he has a rather strong ideological stance on vaccines and the CDC. One which the editors of his recent article likely wish Mr. Hooker had disclosed when he submitted his paper. \r\n \r\n September 1, 2014, Russell Saunders at the Daily Beast:  Anti-Vaxxers Have a New Hero \r\n In short, not only did experts outside of the CDC verify the original study, but Dr. Hooker\u2019s new paper likely reaches the findings it does because he uses the wrong kind of analysis for the data set....So not only were whatever qualms Dr. Thompson had insufficient to have him remove his name from the original study, they were neither enough to make him speak out publicly in the decade since nor have him willingly attach his name to any effort to debunk it. Not a lot of air tooting that whistle, no matter what the video would lead viewers to believe. \r\n \r\n September 1, 2014, Orac at Respectful Insolence:  The CDC whistleblower William W. Thompson: One last word \r\n \r\n I was unexpectedly contacted by Rick Morgan, William Thompson\u2019s lawyer... he stated that he understood that I thought Thompson either had a beef with his co-investigators or had gone off the deep end. However, he wanted to \u201cplant a seed\u201d that maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014there might be another explanation, that this had been torturing Thompson all these years and he just had to do something because he couldn\u2019t take it any more. \r\n And maybe that is true. I have no way of knowing. I do know that, whatever his motivation, Thompson had done horrible damage and almost certainly endangered African American children to suffer from measles who might not have contracted it otherwise. \r\n \r\n \r\n September 1, 2014, Sullivan at LeftBrainRightBrain:  If this is what keeps a CDC researcher up at night, how would they ever keep a huge conspiracy going? \r\n Think about that. A single result, one which many people agreed didn\u2019t need to be discussed, was held back and this CDC researcher struggled with that decision for a decade. But he and his colleagues are just going along with what is supposedly the biggest cover-up in history? \r\n \r\n September 1, 2014, David Gorski at Science-Based Medicine:  The CDC Whistleblower Saga: Updates, Backlash, and (I hope) a Wrap-up \r\n Now imagine if there had been a real conspiracy to suppress compelling evidence indicating that vaccines cause autism. In that case, there wouldn\u2019t just be a single man torturing himself over decisions made, as Thompson, if we believe Morgan, apparently has. It would be men and women at every level of the CDC. If the CDC couldn\u2019t \u201ckeep Thompson quiet\u201d over this, if Thompson was willing to risk destroying his career over a small subgroup analysis with almost certainly spurious results that weren\u2019t followed-up on when he thought they should be, imagine what would happen if real data demonstrating a strong link between vaccines and autism had been covered up. There would be Bill Thompsons crawling out of the woodwork everywhere, beginning not long after the cover-up began. \r\n \r\n \r\n Posts discussing Hooker's allegations from anti-vaccine sources and those believing Hooker's allegations\u00a0 \u00a0(I will be updating these silently as new posts appear). \r\n Timeline \r\n August 8, 2014: Hooker paper published online \r\n August 18, 2014: Focus Autism Press Release published online \r\n August 18, 2014: Andrew Wakefield's Autism Media Channel Video Alleging a CDC Whistleblower published online \r\n \r\n August 18, 2014, Jake Crosby at  Autism Investigated: CDC Whistleblower Reveals Yet More Research Fraud \r\n August 19, 2014 Age of Autism at Age of Autism:  Whistleblower Says CDC Knew in 2003 of Higher Autism Rate Among African-American Boys Receiving MMR Shot Earlier Than 36 Month s \r\n August 20, 2014,  Mike Adams  at Natural News:  Vaccine bombshell: CDC whistleblower reveals cover-up linking MMR vaccines to autism in African-Americans \r\n August 20, 2014, Age of Autism at Age of Autism:\u00a0 Senior Government Scientist Breaks 13 Years' Silence on CDC's Vaccine-autism Fraud \r\n August 20, 2014  Jon Rappoport  at Jon Rappoport's Blog Breaking:  Breaking: MMR vaccine, autism, CDC coverup\u00a0 \r\n August 21, 2014 Jon Rappoport at Jon Rappoport's Blog:  Vaccine-autism connection: US Congressman stonewalled by the CDC \r\n August 21, 2014 Jon Rappoport at Jon Rappoport's Blog:  Advice for the secret CDC vaccine whistleblower \r\n August 21, 2014: Mike Adams at Natural News: \u00a0 CDC refuses to turn over documents to Congress: Evidence linking MMR vaccines to autism intentionally withheld from investigators \r\n August 22, 2014, Ethan Huff at Natural News,  CDC whistleblower confesses to publishing fraudulent data to obfuscate link between vaccines and autism \r\n August 22, 2014, metamars at  My Firedog Lake:\u00a0CDC refuses to turn over documents to Congress showing MMR vaccines caused autism in black children   (note: metamars' blog post, not an official Firedoglake post) \r\n August 22, 2014: Andrew Wakefield's Autism Media Channel Video Naming William W.

D. The Autism Action Network received the following document today and we believe it to be a genuine statement from William Thompson, Ph. D. \r\n FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\u2014AUGUST 27, 2014 \r\n STATEMENT OF WILLIAM W. THOMPSON, Ph. D., REGARDING THE 2004 ARTICLE EXAMINING THE POSSIBILITY OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MMR VACCINE AND AUTISM \r\n My name is William Thompson. I am a Senior Scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where I have worked since 1998. \r\n I regret my co-authors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data was collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed. \r\n I want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue to save countless lives. I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race. Vaccines prevent serious diseases, and the risks associated with their administration are vastly outweighed by their individual and societal benefits. \r\n My concern has been the decision to omit relevant findings in a particular study for a particular sub-group for a particular vaccine. There have always been recognized risks for vaccination and I believe it is the responsibility of the CDC to properly convey the risks associated with the receipt of those vaccines. \r\n I have had many discussions with Dr. Brian Hooker over the last 10 months regarding studies the CDC has carried out regarding vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes including autism spectrum disorders. I share his belief that CDC decision-making analyses should be transparent. I was not, however, aware that he was recording any of our conversations, nor was I given any choice regarding whether my name would be made public or my voice would be put on the Internet. \r\n I am grateful for the many supportive emails that I have received over the last several days. I will not be answering questions at this time. I am providing information to Congressman William Posey, and of course will continue to cooperate with Congress. I have also offered to assist with reanalysis of the study data of development of further studies. For the time being, however, I am focused on my job and my family. \r\n Reasonable scientists can and do differ in their interpretation of information. I will do everything I can to assist any unbiased and objective scientists outside of the CDC to analyze data collected by the CDC or other public organizations for the purpose of understanding whether vaccines are associated with an increased risk of autism. There are still more questions than answers, and I appreciate that so many families are looking for answers from the scientific community. \r\n My colleagues and supervisors at the CDC have been entirely professional since this matter became public. In fact, I received a performance-based award after this story came out. I have experienced no pressure or retaliation and certainly was not escorted out of the building as some have stated. \r\n Dr. Thompson is represented by Frederick M.

{"date": "Friday, September 12, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t That's the empathy for human suffering in the anti-vaccine movement.\u00a0 \r\n A person (I have concealed the person's name and twitter handle) started off by tweeting: \r\n \r\n #vaccinesNOVA #CDCwhistleblower #cdcfraud @PBS 1950 Total US Deaths from measles 468. 2014 1 in 68 children are autistic. \r\n \r\n Followed closely by \r\n #vaccinesNOVA #CDCwhistleblower #cdcfraud @PBS Scaring us with a childhood illness that killed a total of 468 people in the US in 1950 \r\n \r\n So let us review.\u00a0 \r\n Does measles (the wild type, which  sickened up to 750,000 people a year, and killed up nearly 700 people a year , to prior to the advent of the vaccine) have anything to do with autism? No, almost certainly no. \u00a0Certainly these sorts of illness and death statistics were a solid impetus to develop a vaccine.\u00a0 \r\n Does being immunized with the measles vaccine ( attenuated versions  \u00a0of  several strains  of the wild type measles) \u00a0have anything to do with a person subsequently developing autism?  Over 20 studies  have found  no connection .\u00a0 \r\n It is never acceptable to use fearmongering about the chance of becoming autistic to scare people away from vaccinating. It  dehumanizes real autistic people . \u00a0Autistic people are part of our community.  Autistic people are not \u201cthem.\u201d Autistic people are a part of \u201cus.\u201d \r\n The twitter user continued:\u00a0 \r\n \r\n #vaccinesNOVA #CDCwhistleblower #cdcfraud @PBS Horror if you child should be ill a few days with measles. Lifetime with autism much better. \r\n \r\n   \r\n I pointed out the consequences of not vaccinating. The twitter user didn't care. \r\n \r\n Liz Ditz Stop vaccinating against #measles @redacted go back to 683 deaths a year #CDCwhistleblower #vaccinesNOVA http://1.usa.gov/1ADvOtY \r\n @lizditz 1950 468 deaths total. Not that notable. Does not justify hysteria to vaccinate. \r\n \r\n \r\n The twitter user had other, similar exchanges with vaccine proponents \r\n So there you have the real face of the anti-vaccine movement.

A summary is here . \r\n \r\n My Verdict on the DeStefano Study \r\n The criticism that the study discarded data from African American subjects just doesn\u2019t hold water. No data was discarded. For the subjects who were linked to birth certificates, the researchers performed additional analyses. In this light, I see a careful observational study that assessed the role of potential confounders. \r\n The biggest weakness that I see for this study is that the researchers could not compare subjects who were vaccinated for MMR to those who were not vaccinated at all. The authors wrote that they \u201clacked an unvaccinated comparison group.\u201d The truth is that the vast majority of kids are vaccinated. Consequently, this study compared the distribution of vaccination ages for case and control children to see if the timing impacted the risk of autism. It didn\u2019t. \r\n \r\n \r\n My Verdict on the Hooker Study \r\n On the surface, it looks like there might be something to this study. However, there are problems lurking beneath the surface. The two major problems I see with Hooker\u2019s study are: \r\n \r\n The full data set has been sliced and diced into a small, biased sample. \r\n Low birth weight is an uncontrolled, confounding variable \r\n \r\n \r\n Please read the whole post. I have elided several paragraphs \r\n Thanks to the tiny sample and the uncontrolled confounding variable, Hooker\u2019s results are both imprecise and biased. Consequently, my personal opinion is that Hooker\u2019s results have no scientific value at all. \r\n So. No scandal, no controversy, so no \"whistleblower\" \r\n About the author of the two posts linked above \r\n \r\n I\u2019m Jim Frost and I came to Minitab with a background in a wide variety of academic research. My role was the \u201cdata/stat guy\u201d on research projects that ranged from osteoporosis prevention to quantitative studies of online user behavior. Essentially, my job was to design the appropriate research conditions, accurately generate a vast sea of measurements, and then pull out patterns and meanings from it. \r\n Now at Minitab, I am a technical writer who helps people use our software to gain insights from their own data, whether they\u2019re working in quality improvement, academic research, or another field entirely. I\u2019ll be writing about various experiences and practical tidbits that I\u2019ve learned along the way that may help you in your own research endeavors. \r\n \r\n The two papers under discussion \r\n 1. DeStefano, Frank, Tanya Karapurkar Bhasin, William W.

Think about it. \u00a0You put a little smooth round thing, almost tasteless, in your mouth and bite down. \u00a0KAPOW! \u00a0An explosion of at least four textures and tastes: the smooth tough skin, the slightly-crunchy pulp, the jelly surrounding the seeds, and then the seeds themselves. \r\n What if you want to try out how a tomato tastes without all the fireworks? \u00a0There's something for that: tomato water. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\r\n Tomato water (prep time: 12 hours) \r\n\r\n \r\n A blender or food processor (whirling device)\u00a0 \r\n A colander or strainer \r\n Two layers of cheesecloth to line the straining device \r\n A bowl to catch the liquid that drains from the tomatoes \r\n 2 pounds dead-ripe tomatoes, washed (and cored if necessary) \r\n pinch salt \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n Coarsely chop the tomatoes, preserving the juice (I use a flexible chopping board) \r\n Put the chopped tomatoes, juice, and salt in the whirling device, and pur\u00e9e until smooth and uniform. \u00a0The time will depend upon the capabilities of your device. \r\n Position the cheesecloth-lined colander over the bowl. \r\n Pour the pur\u00e9e into the \u00a0straining device and put into the refrigerator to drain for 12 hours (overnight works well) \r\n In the morning, the bowl will contain a clear, tomato-tasting liquid (tomato water) and the pulp will remain in the cheesecloth. \u00a0 \r\n If you like, freeze the pulp for later addition to soups and stews. \u00a0I use ice-cube trays and transfer the frozen results to a ziplock bag. \r\n Use the tomato water for tasting experiments for the tomato-shy. \r\n Variations include adult beverages such as  Todd Thatcher's Clear Mary \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \r\n For The Brick \u00a0because of  this Facebook post \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.foodrepublic.com/2011/06/04/tomato-water-bloody-mary-recipe", "http://lifewithlegos.wordpress.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/LifeWithLegos/posts/179140562247994"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2013/06/tomatoes-for-beginners-tomato-water-.html", "title": "Tomatoes for beginners: Tomato water "},
{"date": "Sunday, July 21, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n Why would a struggling parochial school, still advertising for students in mid-summer, reject an applicant who is highly qualified academically? \u00a0 \r\n It isn't a financial decision, as the parents are capable of paying the full tuition. \u00a0 \r\n It's not a religious issue;  the school's website specifically states , \"Children of all faiths may attend Saint Rita School. All students attend religion classes, school\u00a0masses and activities.\" \r\n What could it be, then? \r\n The answer is fear of autism and disability discrimination. There are many  social justice issues around autism . \u00a0Now we have another one: exclusion of a qualified student from a desired religious education. \r\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\r\nIt is well-known that Catholic parochial schools are  struggling with enrollment . \u00a0The San Francisco Diocese \u00a0is  no exception. \u00a0\u00a0\r\n In February 2013, the Archbishop of the  San Francisco Diocese , Salvatore Cordileone, announced that  St. Rita School , in Fairfax, Marin County, was to close at the end of the 2012-2013 school year.\u00a0 \r\n The causes for the threatened school closing point directly at short-comings by school administration and board, from an \u00a0enrollment short-fall of about 50 students (assuming class sizes of 20 for preschool through 8th grade); failure to collect tuition in a timely manner (tuition in arrears amounted to about 8% of the 2012-2013 budget); \u00a0and an overly-generous tuition reduction program (about 14% of the budget). \r\n Faced with the closing, t he school community sprang into action : \r\n \r\n Hundreds of people attended meetings organized by Brenda Gubbins of Fairfax, who has two daughters at the school. They went to work contacting elected representatives and raising money. In response, on March 20, San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone agreed to consider keeping the school open if certain conditions were met. To keep the school open, families who are behind in their tuition payments must make up the amount in arrears, which amounts to $100,000; the school must fully cover its operating deficit for the current school year, which is between $250,000 and $300,000; and the school must develop a financially viable operating budget for next year. \r\n \r\nPrior to the Archbishop's March 20 announcement, an anonymous donor pledged to give St. Rita's  $200,000, if the community raised matching funds. \u00a0 In the  March 26 Principal's newsletter , St. Rita's Principal Carol Arritola announced that she was retiring.\r\n \r\n In January, Fr. Ken offered me a contract for the 2013-2014 school year. I told him that I appreciated his confidence in me, but I felt that it was time for me to retire. I did not make this decision after all the problems began. I made the decision because I am 67 years old and the job is more than I want to do in the future. I am leaving at the end of this year knowing that I have done the best job that I knew how to do and that together we have accomplished a great deal over these four years. Fr. Ken will put a search committee together soon to look for the new Principal for Saint Rita School. \r\n \r\n Then there was another great stroke of luck.   On April 15th, an anonymous donor, evidently from San Mateo County, donated a no-strings gift of $250,000 to the school, which ensured the school's financial stability for the 2013-2014 school year. \r\n In the meantime, the Willingham family, who had recently relocated to Marin County, decided to apply to St. Rita's for the 2013-2014 school year for their oldest son, who would be entering 7th grade. \u00a0 \r\n They applied early in May. \u00a0Dr. Willingham \u00a0wrote of the school,\u00a0 \r\n \r\n The attractions were numerous\u2014the middle school staff have a high reputation, in spite of the school\u2019s financial woes, the classes are small, and the overall atmosphere is one of scrappy fortitude rather than the usual air of entitlement so many private schools emit. \r\n \r\n From third through sixth grade, young Mr. Willingham was in a hybrid home-school/bricks-and-mortar program, in which he excelled, both academically and socially. \u00a0He\u00a0has very high academic capacity -- the kind that any school, let alone a struggling school, would be happy to have. \u00a0The young man \" shadowed \" at St. Rita's for a day and enjoyed it. \u00a0The parents assumed, especially given the fact that the school was continuing to advertise for students, that their son would be accepted.\u00a0 \r\n Not surprisingly, given the small size of the school, there's not an Admissions Director (to the best of my knowledge, few parochial schools have such as staff position). \u00a0At St. Rita's, the 2013-2014 \u00a0admissions process appears to be managed by the Principal, possibly in consultation with teachers; the Principal's  decision is final . \r\n May went by, and the Willingham family heard nothing from St. Rita's, until early in June, when they received the following letter from the retiring principal: \r\n \r\n ......After seeing his performance and studying the information that you shared with us, it is our decision not to accept [redacted] for the 7 th \u00a0grade. [Redacted] needs much more resource and teacher time than we have available due to our very limited number of teachers on our staff.\u201d \r\n \r\n What performance?  \u00a0Young Mr. Willingham had been in class as an observer, not a participant. \u00a0The two teachers who had him in class had reported that he did well, and one thought he would \"be a good fit\". \r\n What information?  \u00a0The Willingham family had included contact information for young Mr. Willingham's previous school, and apparently no one from St. Rita's had followed through.\u00a0 What supports?  \u00a0The Willingham family had been open about their son's autism, and the fact that he has been without an aide at school since 2009. \u00a0He needs no academic support and no more behavioral support than any other 7th grader. The process and the Willingham admission decision appears to be in direct contraction to St. Rita's Parent-Student Handbook, on page 16, reads: \r\n \r\n ADMISSIONS: STATEMENT OF NON-DISCRIMINATION  Saint Rita School, mindful of its mission to be witness to the love of Christ for all, admits students of any race, color, and national and/or ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs and activities generally accorded to or made available to students at this school. Saint Rita School does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis or race, color, and national and/or ethnic origin, age, sex or  disability  in administration of educational policies, admissions policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school-administered programs. \r\n A student is admitted to Saint Rita School only if it is determined that the child has a reasonable, wellfounded hope of successfully completing the school\u2019s program. Students are  interviewed and evaluated  to determine readiness. Results of the interview and evaluation are confidential. \r\n \r\n Here is the kicker: Young Mr. Willingham was not interviewed by the school principal at any time. \u00a0Nor was he formally interviewed by either of the individuals listed on the school website as \"resource specialists\". \u00a0He did not speak to the  school's pastor . \u00a0\u00a0 In June, Dr. Willingham (a PhD, not an MD), appealed St. Rita's decision to the  Diocese of San Francisco's superintendent of schools , who did not respond. \u00a0Neither did a member of St. Rita's  School Board of Directors \u00a0or the school's pastor. \u00a0 \r\n So Dr. Willingham took the next step. \u00a0 On July 5th,  she published a blog post,  concluding: \r\n \r\n The bottom line? This school rejected our academically capable, emotionally mature son, using a rationale that is demonstrably and clearly without basis. This school discriminated against our son because of his autism, plain and simple. This administrator feared autism. She immediately presumed incompetence and stuck with that assumption in the face of a pile of evidence to the contrary, and she never bothered to meet with him or us to discuss it in good faith. And that is not OK. Not just because of our son but on behalf of\u00a0 any \u00a0autistic or otherwise disabled person. \r\n For this reason, I will unmask the pseudonyms in this post and go wide if we do not learn that there has been a good-faith and appropriate effort to review our son\u2019s application and evaluate it. This school and the Archdiocese of Urban Area need to be aware that this kind of blatant discrimination, this dismissiveness of a person with disabilities based on presuming incompetence is\u00a0 not acceptable \u00a0and that a loud, not even-remotely-joyful noise will arise in the face of it.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \r\n The  school's pastor , \u00a0Rev. Dr. Kenneth Weare,  finally responded  to Dr. Willingham by mail on July 19th. He upheld Principal Arritola's\u00a0decision to deny young Mr. Willingham admission, with a whitewash, claiming he and other school personnel had given\u00a0 \r\n serious and concerted evaluation of the circumstances. \r\n \r\n Except, of course, they had not. \r\n Dr. Willingham  responded to the pastor with an email \r\n \r\n \r\nI note here that the way the decision process is described, only one person in the group making the determination could have been someone who met with and interacted personally with our son, and that no one involved has gotten in touch with any of our son's previous teachers about his abilities. All of our statements that our son needs no supports and our provision of information supporting that and of teacher contact information for the same purposes have gone completely overlooked in favor of a blanket, unfactual determination that our son requires extra \"resources\" and \"care.\" Only one member of the team that made this decision interacted personally with our son, and she spent an hour with me after his shadow day expressing nothing but positive reactions about it. Our son's ITBS scores are in line with or exceed those published for the school. He performs at or above grade level in all subject areas, without supports. For these reasons, we must infer that institutional discrimination is at work here.\r\n \r\n As I reviewed what happened, I realized something. \u00a0Arritola, Weare, and possibly the \"school counselor\" are all near retirement age or beyond. \u00a0Maybe their ideas about autism haven't moved into the 21st century. \u00a0 That's not an excuse, but an observation. Maybe, like other social changes, real autism acceptance will take younger, more educated people being in educational leadership positions.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n Here's another thing that struck me. \u00a0Rev. Dr. Weare is proud of his 30-year history advocating for and teaching social justice. \u00a0 He missed an opportunity here.The Autism National Committee (AutCom) \"We believe that inclusive education is a matter of social justice and not clinical debate.\" \u00a0 \r\n The Diocese of Buffalo: \r\n \r\n Our Church\u00a0 Opens Minds\u00a0 through awareness about the variety of disabilities that affect people every day.\u00a0 There is no\u00a0 us \u00a0and \u00a0them\u00a0 when it comes to disabilities.\u00a0\u00a0 All people are differently-abled and all people will experience some\u00a0disability, at least once in life.\u00a0A parish\u00a0 Opens Minds\u00a0 whenever it takes concrete steps to exercise God's compassion for people who are\u00a0differently-abled physically, mentally or emotionally.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n The National Catholic Partnership on Disability has addressed  Access in Catholic Education  with a ringing call: \r\n Catholic schools more perfectly reflect the single flock envisioned by Jesus, our Shepherd, when they welcome and integrate students with disabilities into the total life of the school. \r\n There are books  All Are Welcome: Inclusive Service Delivery in Catholic Schools  and  Inclusive Catholic Schools: A Matter of Possibilities  and a leaders  Martin K Scanlan ,  Juliana Taymans  and  Michael Termini , to name three.\r\n \r\n Maybe this is an opportunity for the  education department  of the Diocese of San Francisco to develop a more mature understanding of academically-capable autistic students who seek a Catholic education in the Diocese, and what those students and their families can bring to each of their schools. \u00a0Other parochial schools have made the effort,  according to a 2010 article. \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n Sources \r\n \r\n Spring 2007 Peter Myer, Can Catholic Schools Be Saved?

It doesn't happen. Blood mercury does not equal hair mercury. The second flaw is the data collection methods (the hair used in the study). The third flaw is that the study found that the autistic children had lower hair mercury levels than the neurotypical controls. Rather than accepting that data, the authors went on to spin \"tooth fairy tales\" to explain why that might be so (the idea that autistic children had impaired mercury excretion). The fourth flaw in the study involves the hair analyzed: the samples had been in storage under unknown conditions for a median of five and a half years. \r\n Do I really need to go on why Holmes et al. is a broken reed?  It was, when published, a footling study. \r\n But wait: One more thing you should know: Holmes et al. 2003 authors' affiliations are given as Safeminds. Safeminds is an acronym for Sensible Action For Ending Mercury Induced Neurological Disorders.

I prefer to look at mouths. My eyes dart about and don\u2019t sustain direct eye contact. If my wife is involved in the conversation, I prefer to look at her face instead of other people\u2019s faces. I will glance at the other people and then return to her face. \r\n I can frequently see when other people start getting uncomfortable with my gaze flitting about. Women, in particular, seem to adjust the necklines of their tops because they notice my gaze is below the gaze line to their eyes. I guess that they assume that if a male is looking below their eyes, that we are looking at the chest area. They don\u2019t realize that I am looking at their mouth and all around the room as well. My darting eyes seem to be unsettling for many people. \r\n \r\n I think Steve for the clarity of his statement. \u00a0I have an unconscious habit of maintaining fairly strong eye contact when I am in a conversation, especially if the conversation has emotional content. \u00a0Because I can see Steve in my mind's eye, I will (I hope) be better in conversations about being mindful of how I look at the person I'm speaking to. \u00a0 The \"darting eyes\" feature is another one to be mindful of -- I tend to assume that a person who does that is nervous, or anxious, or wants to leave my company. \u00a0Of course, I only notice that because I am looking into eyes..hmmn. \u00a0Changing my conversational behavior might make conversations more comfortable for both parties.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n 2. Personal space \u2014 I notice that other people tend to stand too close to me. I feel comfortable with my wife at that distance, but it makes me uncomfortable when other people stand very close to me. I have been in several conversations involving my wife and one other person and I find myself wanting to move away from the other person because they are often nearly shoulder to shoulder with me. \r\n \r\n I am usually pretty good about personal space, as I don't like to be too close to people I don't know well. \u00a0But I do edge closer in noisy spaces, given that as I've gotten older, it is harder to pick out spoken language from the background hum. \r\n \r\n 3. Processing speed \u2014 I often take a few extra seconds to process all of the information that is coming in from another person. I often have to consciously work out what they are saying and what the tone and inflection in their voice means in context with their words. I don\u2019t always pick up on their body language either.  \r\n Most non-autistic people seem to do this without thinking about it. For them it is automatic, and in the background of their minds. For me, it takes some of my focus and attention. These issues often cause me to take a little (or a lot) of extra time to formulate a reply.  \r\n \r\n Reading Steve's words reminded me of the work of audiologist  Ray Hull, Ph.D., \u00a0who has studied auditory comprehension in children and typically-developing adults. Hull wrote, \r\n \r\n \"The problem is that adults are speaking at a rate that a child's central nervous system, or their brain, cannot comprehend. Adults, for example, generally speak at a rate of about 160 to 170 words per minute. Whereas, the child's central nervous system can process speech at a rate of about 124 words per minute.\"  \r\n \r\n I am not saying that Steve's nervous system is like a child's.  I am saying that many people (myself included) unconsciously talk more rapidly than our conversational partners can listen.  It is a reminder to slow down my speech and to wait, attentively, while my conversational partner thinks through what I have said, and formulates a response.  Rapid cross-talk isn't a sign of intelligence or superiority, it is a sign of ill manners.  \r\n \r\n In group conversations, this delay often means that the conversation has already moved on and I am too late to add my input to the the conversation. If I speak out in that case, it is out of step with the others and seems like I am moving the conversation backwards. It becomes a source of frustration and/or awkwardness. Other times, people just don\u2019t understand the delay in my reply. \r\n Some people don\u2019t know what to make of these slightly out of synchronization communication issues that I have. As a result some will interrupt me or simply walk away before I have made my point. That is very distressing and feels disrespectful to me. I don\u2019t deserve to be ignored and made to feel insignificant, or invisible to others. I want to be included and treated as an equal human being. \r\n Please take these autistic communication issues into consideration and accept that I do want to talk. I enjoy conversing and interacting with friends and acquaintances. With just a little understanding and acceptance, I can be included and not made to feel bad about my conversational difficulties. \r\n \r\n I for one resolve to do better in all my conversations with all people. \r\n Steve Summers' guest posts at Autismum: \r\n \r\n I was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome (part of the Autism Spectrum) as an adult. I was diagnosed following my 11-year-old son\u2019s diagnosis with Aspergers. I am happy to have my diagnosis. It was like a light being turned on that illuminated my entire life in a new way. Now I understand why I never really \u2018fit in.\u2019 It is like having a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders to have my diagnosis. \u2013 Steve Summers \r\n \r\n \r\n 10 Tips on How to Communicate with Autistic People \r\n Don't Sweat the Small Stuff \r\n I am Autistic and I Am Tired \r\n \r\n Steve Summers on Facebook\u00a0 https://www.facebook.com/Steve.R.Summers?fref=ts \r\n Steve Summers on Twitter\u00a0 https://twitter.com/AlohaWaimea \r\n Steve Summers on Google+\u00a0 https://plus.google.com/115911862705754942916/posts \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://plus.google.com/115911862705754942916/posts", "http://autismum.com/2013/05/31/guest-post-autism-and-conversational-differences/", "http://autismum.com/2013/05/31/guest-post-autism-and-conversational-differences/", "http://www.wichita.edu/thisis/wsunews/newsrelease/?nid=309", "http://autismum.com/guest-posts/steve-summers/", "http://autismum.com/2012/05/07/10-tips-on-how-to-communicate-with-autistic-people/", "http://autismum.com/2012/08/24/dont-sweat-the-small-stuff/", "http://autismum.com/2012/10/25/i-am-autistic-and-i-am-tired/", "https://www.facebook.com/Steve.R.Summers?fref=ts", "https://twitter.com/AlohaWaimea", "https://plus.google.com/115911862705754942916/posts"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2013/06/steve-summers-on-autistic-conversational-differences.html", "title": "Steve Summers on Autistic Conversational Differences"},

Click to enlarge.\u00a0   \r\n April 5, 2015: Edited to Add: I have added a list of screenings of the film at the bottom of the post. \r\n April 10, 2015: Edited to Add: I have added a list of responses to cancellations of \u00a0screenings at the bottom of the post. \r\n \r\n Reviews of Andrew Wakefield's film,  Vaxxed . The film is being positioned as a documentary, but there are a number of reasons to doubt that the film is entitled to be called such. One blogger has coined the word fraudumentary to describe it. \u00a0 \r\n Relative to reviews, remember that Wakefield  refused let reporters view the film on the ConspiraSea cruise . No advance copies (screeners) of the film have been made available, which is unusual.\u00a0 \r\n Then, there was all the  kerfuffle over the film first getting a slot at Tribeca Film Festival, then getting pulled . Finally, the producers scored a theater ( Angelika Film Center ) and the film opened April 1, 2016. ( April 3:\u00a0edited to add: on the decision to pull the film from Tribeca2016, please read Chris Barsanti's excellent piece  Why the Tribeca Film Festival was right to pull Vaxxed \u00a0\u00a0at Little White Lies.) As I often do, I will be updating this list silently after this post goes live at 3:00 pm PDT, April 2 2016.\u00a0 \r\n Negative Reviews: \r\n \r\n \r\n April 1 2016 Eric Kohn at Indiewire  'Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe' is Designed to Trick You (Review) : The controversial documentary pulled from the Tribeca Film Festival is one-sided propaganda.\r\n \r\n .....the movie would have fit better in a sidebar showcasing tone-deaf agitprop alongside the likes of Dinesh D'Souza's gloomy \"2016: Obama's America\" and Stephen K. Bannon's hagiographic Sarah Palin clip show \"The Undefeated.\" But Wakefield's self-aggrandizing approach walks a more troubling ethical line, pushing an outrageous agenda only evident to viewers willing to look beneath its paranoid surface. ... \r\n Shifting between media reports and a handful of anti-vaccine activists \u2014 including, naturally, a straight-faced Wakefield himself \u2014 \"Vaxxed\" makes epic conspiratorial claims, with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) emerging as its greatest target. Proclaiming that the organization has buried connections between autism and vaccines, \"Vaxxed\" presents a series of secretly recorded phone calls as its main coup. These conversations, between environmental researcher Brian Hooker and CDC \"whistleblower\" William Thompson, were previously summarized in a short video that Wakefield circulated last year. Since then, they have led to a book-length set of allegations and countless speculation about how much information the calls actually reveal. In the snippets shown throughout the movie, they hint at some modicum of disorganization to the CDC's research, but hardly validate the outlandish claims at the root of Wakefield's studies, which have themselves been suspected of biased reporting tactics. Needless to say, he's not the most credible person to helm a supportive overview. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 1 2016 Rebecca Robbins at Stat:  We watched the movie \"Vaxxed\" so you don't have to  \r\n \r\n The film struck a paranoid tone, seeking to raise doubts about the \u201cmedical industrial complex.\u201d... \r\n It hit at a range of targets: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for allegedly hiding vital data. Drug companies, for trying to \u201ccreate an environment of constant vaccination from cradle to grave.\u201d Even television news programs, for allegedly promoting the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s agenda..... \r\n Bigtree told STAT the film was backed by about $400,000 in donations. Promotional materials listed one donor as a charitable foundation backed by hedge fund manager Bernard Selz. A Texas law firm, Cullinane Law Group, was listed as another donor. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n April 1 2016 Frank Scheck at The Hollywood Reporter  Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe': Film Review \r\n \r\n The film is directed by Andrew Wakefield, and I would say that he shouldn't give up his day job except that he no longer has one. He's the British gastroenterologist who was one of the dozen authors of a study about the link between vaccination and autism published in a British medical journal in 1998. The study was retracted in 2010 and has been widely discredited. He's since had his medical license revoked over various ethical and financial improprieties, although not surprisingly you don't hear about that in the film. ... \r\n Still, it's hard to take the film's arguments seriously, considering that many of them are made by the likes of the disgraced filmmaker, Brian Hooker (not exactly a major figure in the medical world) and Del Bigtree. The last, afforded the most screen time, was formerly a producer of The Doctors, a daytime talk show created by Dr. Phil. Draw your own conclusions. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 1 2016 Melena Ryzik at the New York Times  Anti-Vaccine Film, Pulled From Tribeca Film Festival, Draws Crowd at Showing \r\n \u201cVaxxed\u201d itself vacillates between vilifying vaccines and saying that they save lives. Sowing this kind of confusion, Mr. Drezner said in an email, may harm the very people it aims to save. \u201cAll the energy we spend fighting over a debunked vaccine conspiracy theory,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis energy we\u2019re not spending on working with autistic people to help them better thrive in the world today.\u201d \r\n \r\n April 1 2016 April Haglage at The Daily Beast  I Watched the Anti-Vaxx Doc Booted from TriBeCa Film Festival and It Was Insane  In a nearly empty theater, I watched in horror as the filmmakers used crap science to link autism with vaccines.\r\n \r\n The film was, in a word, overwhelming. Full of dark music, white type on a black screen, toddlers red faced and screaming, and a hysterical young boy threatening to kill his dad. There were parents weeping over home videos of their kids, and a brother pleading with his parents not to vaccinate his little sister, whom he\u2019s pushing in a swing beside him. \r\n There were symbolic moments, too, like that of the so-called CDC \u201cwhistleblower\u201d sticking the files that he saved on a shelf and an open briefcase that was repeatedly filled with papers. There were graphs and charts and numbers, none of which remained long enough to digest. The needle was a recurring image as well, at one point, shown eerily blowing out a cloud of blue smoke. \r\n While unsettling and at times confusing, the film wasn\u2019t enough to convince someone well versed in the world of vaccines and autism that a connection is actually there. But the well versed in these worlds are not the film\u2019s demographic. It\u2019s parents with children who\u2019ve been suddenly been dealt a bad hand and others worried that they will be too. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 1 2016  Jessica Glenza ,The Guardian  Controversial Vaxxed film premieres in New York despite scientists' outcry \r\n The three-part storyline of Vaxxed begins there, with Wakefield\u2019s own research, followed by interviews with families of autistic children who believe vaccination caused the disorder, then what the film alleges is a cover-up of autism research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \r\n \r\n April 1 2016 Jessica Glenza's interview with  Philip LaRussa MD , a professor of pediatric medicine at Columbia University Medical Center. He specializes in infectious diseases and immunization, in  Vaxxed: an expert view on controversial film about vaccines and autism \r\n The first story is that Wakefield really conducted fraudulent research, and he did nothing in the film to address any of the concerns about all the discrepancies in his research. It\u2019s as if that didn\u2019t exist. He didn\u2019t mention the fact that he lost his license in Great Britain, he didn\u2019t mention the fact that [11] of his co-authors withdrew their names from his paper. He didn\u2019t mention the fact that there was a series of investigative articles by [Sunday Times journalist] Brian Deer. None of that existed in this film. \r\n \r\n April 2, 20016 Matt Carey at LeftBrainRightBrain  Autism Movie review: VAXXED . (The post consists of Carey quoting Eric Kohn's review of the film at IndieWire, with additional knowledgeable commentary by Carey, who is arguably the best-informed person on the planet about the CDC whistleblower manufactroversy and Wakefield's history of mendacious filmmaking.)\r\n \r\n Let\u2019s take another step back, a step away from the film. Here\u2019s the thing about this from my perspective as an autism parent\u2013if you believe this represents a real effect (that the MMR causes autism in African American males), you act very differently than Andrew Wakefield. You try to answer the question. Wakefield was at one point running a charity whose stated purpose was autism research (in the end, about half the money went to Wakefield\u2019s salary). He is reported to have raised $400k for this film. Four hundred thousand dollars. I have seen no effort whatsoever by Mr. Wakefield to investigate this claim of a link between MMR and autism in African American boys. Instead we keep hearing about efforts on getting a congressional hearing on the subject. For those outside the autism community: there have been two autism related congressional hearings in recent years. While they have provided much YouTube footage for people pushing the idea that vaccines cause autism, they haven\u2019t done anything to make life better for the autism communities.  Nothing . .... \r\n We can go through the details, but let me just say that a great deal of VAXXED is not really directly the story\u2013the story that is promised in the VAXXED web page. A lot of discussion about and by Andrew Wakefield, for example. We also get parents speaking about their beliefs that vaccines caused their child to be autistic. While very emotional and not something to be dismissed, this doesn\u2019t address the question of whether vaccines cause autism or if there was malfeasance at the CDC. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 2 2016 Jordan Hoffman at The Guardian  Vaxxed review \u2013 one-sided film leaves the elephant in the room \r\n \r\n The director, the former doctor Andrew Wakefield, is presented in the film as one of three or four key, highly educated talking-head witnesses. (Another, the credits reveal, is the film\u2019s producer Del Bigtree.) At no point does the movie address or deflect the elephant in the room: that the British gastroenterologist and researcher has been struck off as a licensed doctor. ... \r\n As a film-maker, Wakefield could surely use a regimen of steroids. Talking-head interviews of statisticians and the few scientists willing to take the anti-vax position hardly make for stimulating cinema. There are also late-in-the-game formal inconsistencies, such as introducing kids directly addressing the camera, pleading to \u201ckeep our baby siblings safe\u201d. But Vaxxed isn\u2019t quite as inept or loony as YouTube docs in the vein of 9/11 hoax film Loose Change. There are even some stretches where it feels like a real (albeit boring) movie. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 3, 2016 Emily Willingham at Forbes  Andrew Wakefield's Film Fizzles \r\n \r\n The vaccine of focus in the film is the MMR vaccine. As Robbins noted in the Stats piece, this vaccine has been demonstrated to be safe in many large-scale studies. \r\n Meanwhile, in California, measles has cropped up at one of the state\u2019s most undervaccinated elementary schools, forcing its temporary shutdown and an alert about possible exposure at a restaurant in California\u2019s Amador County. These are echoes of the 2015 outbreak in California, one of several US outbreaks in which more than half of those affected were intentionally unvaccinated. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 3 2016 Skeptical Raptor at Skeptical Raptor  In Memoriam \u2013 Fraudumentary Vaxxed By Andrew Wakefield \r\n I mean it really wasn\u2019t that hard. Mr. Andy Wakefield is a fraud \u2013 period. Vaccines and autism are unrelated according to all of the high quality epidemiological research \u2013 period. And the so called CDC Whistleblower manufactroversy (another invented portmanteau, just to be thorough), a key part of the film, was really much adieu about nothing. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n April 3 Joe Leydon at Variety Film Review: \u2018 Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe\u2019 \r\n \r\n this slickly produced but scientifically dubious hodgepodge of free-floating paranoia, heart-rending imagery \u2013 lots of shots of cute infants who reportedly were damaged by vaccines \u2014 and anti-Big Pharma conspiracy mongering likely would have preached to the converted during a handful of theatrical engagements, then slid into the relative obscurity of non-commercial exhibition and home video. Given its now-elevated profile, however, \u201cVaxxed\u201d is bound to have at least a slightly longer shelf life, and may even benefit from being attacked by scientists, film critics and other \u201cestablishment\u201d types. ... \r\n In the end, however, \u201cVaxxed\u201d comes across as a grab-bag of charts, theories and anecdotal evidence that would never pass muster by the editors of any major scientific journal (like, say, the Lancet), and too often resembles the kind of one-sided, paranoia-stoking agitprop that political activists construct to sanctify true believers and assault infidels. It should be taken with several grains of industrial-strength salt \u2014 although, to be fair, it does serve as a kind of one-stop-shopping source for anyone seeking to know just what the anti-vaccination crowd is all fired up about. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 3 2016 Tom Rosten at PBS POV 2016  New Documentary Chooses Anecdotal Evidence Over Scientific Credibility \r\n You\u2019d think that Wakefield, who has been discredited by the medical profession and who is confronting a scientific topic, would lay a foundation of scientific credibility for the notion that MMR causes autism in Vaxxed. But no. There\u2019s a second party reference to such papers or studies but they\u2019re never examined. This alone should put up a huge red flag. \r\n \r\n April 3 2016 W. Ian Lipkin at The Wall Street Journal  Anti-Vaccination Lunacy Won\u2019t Stop \r\n \r\n In 2010, after concerns arose about [Wakefield's] research, the U.K.\u2019s General Medical Council revoked Mr. Wakefield\u2019s medical license based on cross-examination of physicians and evidence from 36 witnesses. The council found that he had done invasive research on children without ethical approval, acted against the clinical interests of each child, failed to disclose financial conflicts of interest, and misappropriated funds. In 2010 the Lancet retracted the 1998 paper based on ethical irregularities and other misrepresentations. In 2004, 10 of the 12 authors who joined Mr. Wakefield on that paper explicitly disavowed any link between MMR and autism. \r\n The movie \u201cVaxxed\u201d mentions none of this. A film that distorts and omits established facts is not a documentary, and any venue screening it is complicit in knowingly misrepresenting science and disseminating misinformation. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 4 2016 Todd W at Harpocrates Speaks  Wakefield's \"Vaxxed\" Demands Less Safety \r\n While the demands at the end of Vaxxed appeal to the viewers' emotions, and, on the surface, seem reasonable, once we take a closer look at the details, it should be readily apparent that matters would become worse rather than better. But perhaps that is the goal. Make vaccines less tenable so that the argument to get rid of vaccines altogether seems reasonable and is more likely to come to pass. Unfortunately, public health would suffer. We would see more disease, more permanent disabilities, and more death. Those who suffer real vaccine injuries would have a more difficult time getting compensation. But how many people who see this film will have the knowledge to get past the surface veneer, the seemingly reasonable sheen that hides the darker and more dangerous outcome? My guess is very few. \r\n \r\n April 4 2016 Ed Cara at Medical Daily  Controversial Documentary 'Vaxxed' Premiered In NYC This Weekend; We Decided To See It \r\n If nothing else, the Tribeca fallout demonstrated clearly that whatever conversations we need to have about the separate but important issues of vaccine safety or autism, there\u2019s no place at the table for charlatans like Andrew Wakefield anymore. \r\n \r\n April 6 2016 Pete vonder Haar at Village Voice  Anti-Vaccination Doc 'Vaxxed,' Booted From Tribeca, Is a Tragic Fraud \r\n \r\n The crux of the entire movie \u2014 and understand, Thompson\u2019s statements are here only because Hooker recorded him without his knowledge \u2014 is Thompson asserting that his fellow study authors threw certain documents away, thus invalidating the study. \r\n And...that\u2019s it. In the decades-long absence of supporting evidence for his MMR \u201chypothesis,\u201d Wakefield and Hooker hinge the remnants of their argument on the word of a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d who only ended up in that role when he was duped by Hooker. (Wakefield\u2019s license was revoked in 2010.) \r\n The film\u2019s other key player is Del Bigtree, a medical journalist and host of the Dr. Phil\u2013produced daytime show The Doctors, who, as you conveniently won\u2019t learn until the credits roll, is also a producer of the film. Bigtree insists that parents with concerns about the vaccine were \u201cwritten off\u201d and that the CDC\u2019s vaccine schedule is something Americans are \u201crequired to adhere to,\u201d which is blatantly false. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 8 2016 Yasmin Tayag at Inverse  I Went to a Morning Showing Andrew Wakefield's 'Vaxxed' and Made Weird New Friends \r\n Apparently the anti-vaxx doc dropped by Robert De Niro from the Tribeca Film Festival lineup, which I thought was unremarkable aside from its questionable message, was a total crowd please. The audience wanted their suspicions confirmed and that is precisely what the film haltingly attempts to do. When I spoke to the clappers, they told me that they were just happy to get \u201cfacts.\u201d Apparently they were looking for very specific facts that could be connected to create a nefarious narrative arc. \r\n \r\n April 11, 2016 Paul Offit MD at The Hollywood Reporter  Anti-Vaccine Doc 'Vaxxed': A Doctor's Film Review \r\n \r\n If MMR really does cause autism, why hadn\u2019t it been found in 15 other studies, many of which included African-Americans and almost all of which didn\u2019t involve the CDC? Are there other whistleblowers who just haven\u2019t come forward yet? The real explanation for Vaxxed's \u201crevelation\u201d isn\u2019t conspiracy or hidden data; it\u2019s something else. When compared with their Caucasian counterparts, African-American boys in Atlanta in 1994 were under-vaccinated. In order to qualify for autism-support programs, this subset of under-vaccinated children with autism had to get vaccinated. In other words, it wasn\u2019t that MMR had caused autism; it was that the diagnosis of autism had caused them to get MMR. Not surprisingly, this is never explained in the film. \r\n Whistleblowers are supposed to blow the whistle on malfeasance that has resulted in harm. In this case, there was no malfeasance and there was no harm. Which is probably why the whistleblower never really blows the whistle. Others in the movie try to blow it for him but without much sound. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 19 2016 Charles Livingstone at Crikey.com  A public health expert reviews the anti-vax film that flummoxed Robert De Niro  (Note:  Dr. Livingstone  is an Australian public health expert.)\r\n \r\n Vaxxed presents Wakefield as a concerned medical specialist, the only one prepared to discuss the harm he claims the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine wreaks. He argues that the entire medical and research establishment is in league to maintain a tissue of lies in defence of the profits of pharmaceutical companies. \r\n This claim, the foundation of the film, is laughable. But it gets more ridiculous. \r\n A \u201cstudy\u201d cited in his dramatic, misleading film, was undertaken by an engineer whose child has ASD. This study, subsequently discredited and withdrawn from the journal that published it, purported to be a re-analysis of data collected by the Centers for Disease Control for their studies of any possible relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism in young children. \r\n The details of this are moderately technical, but suffice to say that the \u201cre-analysis\u201d sought to impose an inappropriate method onto data collected for another type of study. That\u2019s like comparing a banana to a Ferrari. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 21, 20016 Matt Carey at LeftBrainRightBrain  Why do people have to see Vaxxed to criticize it? Wakefield\u2019s own description of us tells us Vaxxed is bogus. \r\n \r\n But as we\u2019ve just seen, the key point of the film is precisely not Thompson\u2019s words or opinion. \r\n Wakefield appears to be using William Thompson as a sock puppet. We are told what Wakefield seems to either believe or wants us to hear. And with the claim that it\u2019s not Wakefield doing the telling but Thompson. \r\n But Wakefield\u2019s own words about Vaxxed don\u2019t match Thompson\u2019s own words. \r\n But per Wakefield people can\u2019t criticize the film. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 27, 2016 Sarah Gill at The Age  Anti-immunisation movie Vaxxed is a platform for its maker, not its message \r\n \r\n Don't be fooled \u2013 Wakefield's story is not the tale of a man wronged by powerful corporations or the medical establishment, which, in fact, closed ranks to protect him. It's the story of a physician who set out to cast doubt on vaccine safety before he'd even gathered the evidence, and he did so not for the public good, but for private gain. \r\n If this sounds personal, that's because it is. Scores of parents in the early 2000s, myself included, harboured a deep sense of unease about the 18-month MMR, and solely because of a small and inconclusive \u2013 but nonetheless troubling \u2013 study by a man uniquely positioned to exploit our greatest fears. Wakefield's hunger for media attention, his ferocious personal ambition and cunning business dealings \u2013 including a patent filed in 1997 for a vaccine to replace the triple shot and generate millions of pounds in annual revenue \u2013 were a toxic mix. And not much, it seems, has changed. \r\n \r\n \r\n May 13, 2016, Danny Wicentowki at River Front Times  Vaxxed, Opening at the Tivoli Today, Blames Vaccines for Autism \u2014 But It's Bullshit \r\n \r\n The documentary presents Wakefield as a neutral voice of reason, as it does one of the film's producers, Del Bigtree. Yet it fails to disclose how a Sunday Times investigation uncovered Wakefield's financial interests the debunked 1998 study. In 2010, those revelations ultimately led the British General Medical Council to bar Wakefield from practicing medicine in the U.K. \r\n In a press release sent to Riverfront Times this week, the film's publicist insisted that Vaxxed is not \"anti-vaccine,\" but only seeks to expose the CDC's cover-up about the MMR study. This is also bullshit. \r\n \r\n \r\n May 20,2016 Jim Shames, M.D. at Ashland Daily Tidings  Guest Opinion: 'Vaxxed' screening is irresponsible \r\n That brings me to the decision by Varsity Theaters to bring the movie \"Vaxxed\" to Ashland. It apparently glorifies the discredited Mr. Wakefield (he was a doctor before he had his license taken away), and uses scary music and disturbing graphics to suggest that unscrupulous government and industry types are withholding the truth from us all, that the MMR vaccine causes autism. This supposed link has been debunked over and over and over again by the most rigorous of researchers. Not to believe the Institute of Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and countless others is to accept a gigantic level of conspiracy to delude the public. Some of us have worked with the CDC and WHO and can assure you they are dedicated public servants whose motivation is to seek the truth, not to get rich and deceive all of us. \r\n \r\n May 20, 2016 Tricia Olzsewski at Washington City Paper  Andrew Wakefield's Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe, Reviewed \r\n I\u2019m no doctor, but I\u2019d suggest that if you really want to get to the bottom of the potential epidemic portrayed in Vaxxed, you do some investigating yourself\u2014as opposed to, you know, taking medical advice from a movie with magicians in it. \r\n \r\n \r\n Positive Reviews\u00a0 \r\n \r\n \r\n April 1 2016 Luke Rudkowski, The Activist Post (Video only):  The Premier Of VAXXED In NYC And Full Review \u00a0(note: this review has been picked up and reposted on a number of chiropractors' sites.) \r\n April 1 2016 Harvey Karten at CompuServe ShowBiz Forum  VAXXED: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe \r\n \r\n One wonders about the effect of this film on those who see it at the Angelika, and hopefully at other theaters around the country thanks to efforts of the brave distributors, Cinema Libre Studio. Administrators like the company chairman Philippe Diaz, do a service by calling the CDC to task with its alleged \u201csuppression of medical data by a governmental agency that may very well be contributing to a significant health crisis.\u201d Yet neither Diaz nor Dr. Wakefield is anti-vaccine. \r\n Who knows what other movies during the past decades gave in to critics and voluntarily agreed not to distribute their wares? Censorship is not supposed to be what we\u2019re about. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 1 2016 The NYC Movie Guru  Documentary Round-Up \r\n Big Pharma seems like a pimp while government agencies such as the CDC and even the mainstream media are essentially Big Pharma's unctuous prostitutes. Learning about the CDC's conscious decision to undermine public welfare reminds me of what Hannah Arendt wrote about the banality of evil. Many members of the CDC are merely following orders and don't even consider the option of subversively criticizing the \"party line\" like Dr. Thompson dared to do so bravely. How is the CDC's cover-up not a crime against humanity? If there were any justice in this world, they would be tried in the Hague. If there were indeed a Nuremberg-like trial for the CDC, it's doubtful that the excuse \"I was just following orders\" would be accepted. \r\n \r\n April 2 2016 ShamROCK at Thinking Moms' Revolution  Vaxxed: A Historical Turning Point? \r\n Del Bigtree\u2019s interpretation of what has happened is crucial in this movie as he brings a new perspective to this issue. He is a very mainstream filmmaker and producer. He understands the magnitude of this story and the ramifications of what bringing forth the truth will have, on a personal level and politically. He understands that he had no choice but to leave his successful and lucrative career producing the award winning TV show \u2018The Doctors\u2019, in order to tell this story. That\u2019s both fascinating and exciting. Very few have the courage or the stamina to do what Del Bigtree has done, and we owe him a great deal. Although, having listened to him in interviews, he, like Andrew Wakefield doesn\u2019t wish this to be about them; this is Thompson\u2019s story. \r\n \r\n April 2 2016 Professor TMR at Thinking Moms' Revolution  Review of the Film \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe \u201d\r\n Because of the current stranglehold that pharmaceutical dollars have on mainstream media, this story is even harder to get out. Just as in that situation, a powerful interest group is working day and night to suppress the facts \u2014 they know children\u2019s lives are being destroyed by their policies and they just don\u2019t care. Fortunately, the filmmakers of Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe know that, in this era of increased communication and transparency, mainstream media censorship can only postpone the truth getting out, not prevent it. So they threw their hearts, minds, and souls into this film as a way of circumventing that censorship. And they did a damned fine job of telling a difficult story that needs to be told. \r\n \r\n April 2 2016 Stephen Ericson at The Truth Barrier Media  Propagandists Willfully Ignore Core Content Of \u201cVaxxed: From Coverup To Catastrophe \u201d\r\n \r\n To Abby and the rest of the media who are busy slamming this film for being misleading while at the same time not even mentioning the name Dr. William Thompson, CDC whistle blower: HE is what this movie is about. If you fail to mention that, you are a propagandist. \r\n For everyone else, not sipping Statist Kool-Aid\u2013 go see it. Whatever you have to do to see it, make sure you see this documentary film, which is a feat of investigative reporting that demolishes the myth of a safe and ordered government \u201chealth\u201d complex. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 4 2016 Del Bigtree at Global Freedom Movement T o Those With Questions About The Movie Vaxxed \u00a0( Not a review; a director or producer cannot review his own product. However in fairness I wished to link to Mr. Bigtree's statement. \r\n History has shown us time and time again that people like Galileo, who break from the scientific consensus to reveal discoveries like \u201cthe earth is not the center of the universe,\u201d are often persecuted. I suppose it\u2019s one of our great human flaws. Both of these men were essentially tried for heresy. The difference is that the imprisonment of Galileo just meant there would be a delay in the advancement of modern astronomy and physics. In Andy\u2019s case we may be responsible for a civilization-ending epidemic of autism that has skyrocketed from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 45 children in less than forty years and is on a crash course for 1 in 2 by 2032. And still the CDC attempts to set our minds at ease with their official statement \u201cwe do not know what\u2019s causing autism.\u201d \r\n \r\n April 5 2016 Lisa Joyce Goes (The Rev) at Thinking Moms' Revolution   Vaxxed! The Movie I Couldn't and Didn't Watch..Until I Did   ( Note Mrs. Goes was provided by an advanced screener of the film by her friend Polly Tommey, who appears in the film and whose charity, Autism Media File, provided funds for the film. Two others of Goes's friends appear in the film. Karen Kain appears in the film and convinced Goes to watch the film; Jeanna Read's son Ian is displayed in the film as an example of the \"horrors\" of autism )\r\n I would highly recommend this film to just about anyone because it does a marvelous job of explaining the how and why at a very quick and understandable pace. Think The Big Short, minus the humor because in the face of so much human suffering that would just be in poor taste. Vaxxed accomplishes what it has set out to do, which is tell the truth about what is happening right now in pediatricians\u2019 offices across this country and the world. \r\n \r\n April 5, 2016, Richard Gale and Gary Null at Progressive Radio Network  Why is the CDC Petrified of the Film Vaxxed? \r\n \r\n A thorough review of the mainstream media\u2019s news bits reveals a remarkably similar editorial script. The media\u2019s central message frames Dr. Wakefield as a \u201cdiscredited\u201d British gastroenterologist who fabricated research in order to mislead the world that the MMR vaccine causes autism. For this reason, we are persuaded to blindly accept that Vaxxed is simply another example of misinformed anti-vaccine lunacy that will endanger the lives of children across America. Therefore, we should ignore the film and save our money, because our shining experts sitting in the high towers at the CDC have already concluded that vaccines do not cause autism. It is better to go back to sleep and not worry about Vaxxed\u2019s medical crime story. On the other hand, this is a story that has likely contributed to the approximately 3.5 million American children and adults with autism today. \r\n In fact, none of these journalists or reporters even know the film\u2019s entire storyline themselves. It has never been publicly released. Any journalists who have seen it would have done so illegally and in violation of the confidentiality agreements between Tribeca and the producers of Vaxxed. \r\n What is rather extraordinary and beyond coincidence is that all of these publications convey identical messages and even share the same quotes and sequential ordering of content and statements. For example, why is a statement by film director Penny Lane, a relatively unknown person with no association whatsoever to vaccine science and policy, notably mentioned in a significant number of these articles? How does this person\u2019s vitriolic comments against Vaxxed end up appearing in The Guardian, New York Times, CNN, Vanity Fair and other news reports all at once? The original script(s) was evidently composed by an unnamed third party(s) and distributed throughout these publications for personalized editing and immediate release. Nevertheless, the message remains the same. And even more curious, none of this press accurately addresses the film\u2019s central story. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 7, 2016 Dawn Lorenz at Raising Natural Kids,  What The NYTimes & Forbes Aren\u2019t Telling You About Vaxxed . This is not so much a review of the film but complaints about negative reviews. \r\n April 8, 2016 Jim West at Age of Autism  A Review of Vaxxed \r\n The film's description of CDC etc is scandalous, but the film merely advocates the single-dose vaccines and is critical of the tri-dose MMR vaccine. A large portion of children with autism have had the MMR disproportionately to the control groups in studies, and the CDC is refusing to do a simple and clear vaccinated vs unvaccinated comparison study, as is true with all vaccines. It appears clear that CDC is hiding meeting records, hiding data, shredding data, corrupting studies, etc. I learned that vaccines are not categorized as pharmaceuticals and are not therefore as stringently tested. The relation of CDC execs to the pharma industry is a revolving door, of course. \r\n \r\n April 8 2016 Curt Linderman at Linderman Unleashed  Linderman Unleashed Reviews VAXXED From Cover Up to Catastrophe \r\n \r\n This week on Linderman Unleashed: my lovely wife and co-host , Kimberly and I will be reviewing the new film regarding the vaccine cover up called VAXXED. Most of the people in this documentary we know personally (to include Dr. Wakefield and Dr. Hooker) and we were lucky enough to have been allowed to view the film in our home. Partly because we were planning on doing this review; but primarily because our very own son, Kaden was in the film. \r\n The film is absolutely amazing and Kim and I go through our very own, personal feelings regarding what we thought of the production. We go into quite a bit of detail when we start talking about the corruption that is so blatantly obvious from all aspects of society as they discuss the nuances of the \u201cconspiracy\u201d to cover up the poisoning of our children. \r\n I have new heroes in my little world: all of those that had a part in the making of this incredible piece of work! \r\n \r\n \r\n April 12 2016 Marcella Piper-Terry at VaxTruth  Rebuttal to Paul Offit\u2019s \u201cReview\u201d of VAXXED: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe \u00a0(Not a review but a list of complaints about Paul Offit's review in The Hollywood Reporter. BTW Dr. Offit did view the film in the New York venue.)\r\n \r\n It\u2019s beyond ridiculous that Dr. Offit would review a documentary he has never seen. But the fact that his review contains so many outrageous and easily-refutable errors is deeply disturbing. \r\n One is left with two choices: to believe that Dr. Offit really doesn\u2019t know the facts \u2014 or that he does, and is lying about them. \r\nI\u2019m not sure which is worse. \r\n \r\n April 12 2016 Christopher Wyatt at the Liberty Beacon  Outed by VaXXed-ABC News, CDC, Big Pharma & MS Reviews \r\n Finally after searching for a good review of VaXXed in the mainstream media, I was hit with the cold truth that an unbiased review would never come from the mainstream media due to government influence and deep ties with the pharmaceutical industry. After a good bit of searching I finally came across a  review from the alternative media  that puts into perspective why VaXXed is so important and why it scares everyone in mainstream media\u2013After years of lying and parroting the words of the CDC and the pharmaceutical industry everyone has been caught. This is the real story, that the game is over not just for the CDC but for mainstream media that is bought and paid for by Big Pharma. \r\n \r\n April 12, 2014 Tami Canal at March Against Monsanto  VAXXED: The Documentary That Destroys The CDC\u2019s Lies About Autism and Vaccines \r\n \r\n Dr. Andrew Wakefield narrates the film and should be regarded globally as a hero in an effort to save our children from the murderers running the CDC. Another thing I am done with is tolerating any mud-slinging or bashing of Dr. Wakefield. It is intolerable what the media and medical industry have done to this heroic man. I encourage you to learn the facts of the true story involving Dr. Wakefield. VAXXED does an amazing job of showing his courage despite the fact that so many have tried to destroy him for simply telling the truth. He believes the combination of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and the age that it is administered is what is of concern and actually states in his VAXXED interview that he believes the shots should be given individually. But as VAXXED documents, the CDC knows allowing children to be vaccinated in single doses would destroy the billion dollar vaccine program. \r\n Anyone that wants to argue that Dr. Andrew Wakefield is \u201canti-vaccination\u201d or a \u201cquack\u201d really needs to go do some independent research. \r\n The documentary is emotional and extremely well done. A portion of the movie focuses on the Hear This Well movement which came to be following a mainstream media attempt to overshadow vaccine dangers with a television anchorwoman ignorantly stating \u201cHear this well, vaccines do not cause autism.\u201d VAXXED shows just a few of the numerous submissions to the Hear This Well campaign and it\u2019s hard not to feel a lump in your throat at the emotional testimony of the parents of these innocent children who are now serving a life sentence with a disease that very likely could have been avoided if scientific integrity had been demonstrated. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 13 2016 Levi Quackenboss at Levi Quackenboss  The top 3 things that #VAXXED is not: a movie review \r\n \r\n Lastly, to close out this post about what something is not, let\u2019s talk about how the stories written about Vaxxed are not journalism. Journalism is the reporting of events and facts to keep society informed. Jumping on the \u201canti-vax, dangerous, shut it down, fraudster, de-bunked\u201d bandwagon and writing about a movie you\u2019ve never even seen nowhere near qualifies as journalism. \r\n Emily Willingham at Forbes, I\u2019m looking at you. Los Angeles Times, New York Times, and Time Magazine, I\u2019m looking at you. I know damn well that none of you saw an advanced copy of the movie before praising De Niro\u2019s decision under duress to pull it from the film festival, and you were all chomping to tell the masses why it\u2019s a dangerous movie. How do any of you call yourself journalists? You know what you are? You\u2019re prostitutes, and I\u2019ll tell you why: you get paid for sucking the virtual cocks of every pharmaceutical company marketing director that advertises with your \u201cnews\u201d organizations. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 28, 2016 Mick LaSalle at STfate  \u2018Vaxxed\u2019: Vaccination critics take their case to film \r\n \u201cVaxxed\u201d is not the end of the discussion and doesn\u2019t contain the whole story. It doesn\u2019t counter its own points. It\u2019s a polemic. But it\u2019s a passionate advocate for its viewpoint, and that makes for compelling viewing. \r\n \r\n \r\n Other Responses to VaxXed, mostly on Film Festival Cancellations -- Approving of Cancellations \r\n \r\n March 28, 2016 Kavin Senapathy, Forbes,  No Andrew Wakefield, You're Not Being Censored And You Don't Deserve Due Process \r\n \r\n I won\u2019t mince words. There is no big pharma conspiracy to push vaccines, and the only fraudulent narrative is that of Andrew Wakefield and his supporters. To screen the film at Tribeca would provide a false balance around an issue that doesn\u2019t have two equal points of view. It\u2019s simple, vaccine opponents fail every test of science and logic and their propaganda doesn\u2019t warrant validation. \u201cWe were denied due process,\u201d laments the statement from the Vaxxed team. \r\n Due process? Due process clauses in the 5th and 14th amendments to the United States Constitution only apply when government is involved. This isn\u2019t a court of law, and Andrew Wakefield doesn\u2019t deserve such considerations for his anti-vaccine propaganda film. \r\n \r\n \r\n March 28, 2016, Mary Elizabeth Williams, Salon,  Anti-vax film isn\u2019t being \u201ccensored\u201d: Andrew Wakefield is not entitled to a prestigious platform for his discredited autism claims \r\n Oh, these poor oppressed disgraced charlatans! Now they don\u2019t get a screening at a prestigious film festival! It\u2019s like a total human rights violation! It\u2019s like when the New Yorker rejects my poems \u2014 how is this even America? Yeah, sorry, that\u2019s not how these things work. Wakefield and his cronies have a right to raise the funds to make whatever misleading, unsupported information they want. They just don\u2019t have a God-given to a platform for it. But if they don\u2019t understand how censorship works, I guess it explains how they don\u2019t know how science does either. \r\n \r\n \r\n Other Responses to VaxXed, mostly on Film Festival Cancellations -- Disapproving of Cancellations \r\n \r\n \r\n March 27, 2016, Mike Adams at Natural News  BREAKING: Robert De Niro was clearly threatened by the vaccine establishment to censor the VAXXED documentary from Tribeca... new details emerge \r\n This is the first time in the history of film and media that the totality of the media establishment has condemned a film that none of them have ever viewed, desperately trying to make sure no American ever witnesses the hour and a half of film footage that is now \"forbidden\" to be viewed in a nation founded on free speech. \r\n \r\n March 27, 2016 Jon Rappoport at Blog,  Vaxxed: How did they threaten Robert De Niro? De Niro talked to Congressman about censored Vaxxed film \r\n There is a very good chance that the CDC reached out to someone, who in turn reached out to De Niro and whispered in his ear and caused the actor to pause for thought. \r\n \r\n April 8, 2016, Jon Rappoport at Blog,  Why Vaxxed was shot down at Tribeca\u2014up close and personal \r\n \r\n \r\n The answer? Jane Rosenthal and her (ex) husband, Craig Hatkoff. That\u2019s my opinion, my story, and I\u2019m sticking to it. \r\n \r\n April 9, 2016, Derek Boze, Activist Post  Why Did Houston\u2019s Mayor Prevent VAXXED From Being Screened? \r\n Activist Post contacted Janice Evans and was able to confirm that the Mayor did not directly stop the film from being shown, but did ask that it not be screened at the Houston International Film Festival. \u201cThe mayor did not halt the showing of the movie. He asked that it not be included in the lineup because the film festival has received city grant funding,\u201d Janice Evans told AP. \u201cIt is contradictory for the city to provide financial assistance to an event that is disseminating an anti-vaccination message that is counter to the work our health department does.\u201d \r\n \r\n April 20,2016 Phillipe Diaz at MovieMaker  Op Ed: The Tribeca Precedent and the Framing of Vaxxed \r\n I will not address here all the accusations against, nor the framing of, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, dating back 18 years, which have been discussed many times before and that we have made available to all. Instead, I ask why all this negative publicity is clearly originating from the same voice? Again, let\u2019s refer to Gale and Null, who reveal the existence of the \u201cCDC\u2019s sophisticated public relations and media operation.

It has not yet been verified.  At  http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2013/08/09/antivaccinationists-against-the-hpv-vaccine-round-5000/ , the blogger (a cancer researcher and surgeon) writes: \r\n \r\n....an entity called ASIA (Autoimmune/Inflammatory Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants). From what I\u2019ve been able to tell, ASIA is basically a made-up syndrome that isn\u2019t generally accepted....Even more dubious are the clinical criteria, four major and four minor, that are used to \u201cdiagnose\u201d ASIA. The idea is that either two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria are required for a diagnosis of ASIA. Out of curiosity, I went back to what appears to be the original article in which ASIA was defined by Yehuda Shoenfeld, who is known for testifying for \u201cvaccine injury\u201d victims and running a journal sympathetic to antivaccine views, even publishing works by quacks like Mark and David Geier.

That is, administrative data (special education data in particular) is not equipped to tell us if there are real differences in the prevalence of autism from one region to the next. No screening has ever demonstrated that substantial differences in administrative prevalence between regions are not simply diagnostic differences.\r\n \r\n This study does not address vaccines. \r\n Does this paper \"demonstrate that vaccines can cause autism\"?\u00a0 No.  \r\n 71.

If there is a genetic susceptibility, why isn\u2019t it seen in those with the greatest exposures? 2) Why isn\u2019t there a report of high autism prevalence in the children, just the grandchildren? My guess is that the response from some will be that the grandchildren received higher doses of mercury in vaccines than did their parents.

{"date": "Tuesday, September 03, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t This is a tiny drop in the ocean of awfulness that is the Attkisson piece, but it is bothering me. \u00a0So I will write about it and put the bother aside. \r\n The  CBS piece read in part , \r\n \r\nBut some in the autism advocacy community 1\u00a0 take issue with the idea that lack of help is an excuse for murder. Ari Neeman, who heads\u00a0a government-funded autism self-advocacy group,\u00a0a dea that lack of help is an excuse for murder., said, \"I think an ideology, a dangerous ideology that preaches that people are better off dead than disabled is what led to Alex Spourdalakis' murder.\"\r\n \r\n Attkisson's phrase \"a government-funded autism self-advocacy group,\"\u00a0is  dog-whistle  reporting. \u00a0 Most anti-vaccine folk are also anti-government, therefore any pronouncement from a \"government-funded\" group can be discounted or denounced. \u00a0(\"Of course, he's paid to say that\"). \u00a0Attkisson is twisting the truth. The man in question is Ari Ne'eman (note the correct spelling). \u00a0 The group is a national organization with local chapters, the  Autistic Self Advocacy Network  (ASAN), which is \u00a0a 501(c)(3) public benefit (\"nonprofit\") \"organization run by and for Autistic people\". ASAN was recognized by the  Internal Revenue Service as a public charity organzation in January 2011 . \r\n Most of ASAN's income comes from donations from individuals such as myself, or from other non-profit organizations such as the ARC and the Dan Marino Foundation. \u00a0This is easily verifiable if one bothers to, for example, sign up for\u00a0 Guidestar\u00a0 or similar organizations that report on non-profit funding sources. \r\n I read the most recently-published ASAN 990, for the fiscal year 2011. (You have to create a free account to view it.) It reported $0.00 in federal funding. \u00a0 \r\n Still bothered by the account published by CBS, most likely written by Attkisson, I emailed Mr. Ne'eman to ask about ASAN's \"government funding\". I will paraphrase his reply: \r\n \"ASAN has received income from the federal government, both as a subcontractor on grants given to another organization and as a direct recipient of federal grants. \u00a0This income is for services performed, not \u00a0general funding grant. \u00a0ASAN has provided policy analysis and data collection on \u00a0autistic self-advocate perspectives.\" \r\n In other words, ASAN is \"government-funded\" the same way that universities are \"government-funded\", because they seek and win government grants for research. There's another bit of dog-whistling: the  amount of hate against Ari Ne'eman  the person that Age of Autism and other anti-vaccine, autism-negative groups have expressed over the years. \u00a0Here's a recent example from Dan Olmstead  \r\n \r\nAs much as I like Sharyl Attkisson and am glad to see this story  -- first exposed by AOA Contributing Editor Lisa Goes months ago -- gain national attention, the segment devolved into a bit of a mess. Ari Ne'eman, really? He gave his usual spiel about how some people think autism is so bad its sufferers might as well be dead. So what, Ari, since you don't believe in treatment? Many people who are in agony wish they and/or someone else they believe to be in agony were dead. Some act on that wish. That's bad. Very bad. Tell us something we don't know.\u00a0\r\n \r\n CBS, or Attkisson, could have contacted or quoted the  Autism Women's Network, whose representative Lydia Brown wrote, in part (emphasis added by me) \r\n \r\n As an organization whose primary constituency is Autistic women and our allies, the Autism Women\u2019s Network joins with the National Council on Disability and the Autistic Self Advocacy Network in calling for the prosecution of hate crimes against disabled people under the provisions of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Disabled people are disproportionately victimized by violent crimes of all types, yet media coverage of these incidents frequently suggests that the appropriate response ought to be sympathy for the aggressors rather than for the victims. \r\n When disabled people are murdered, and particularly when the perpetrators are family members or caregivers, public discourse has a disturbing tendency to suggest that the lives of the disabled victims were the tragedies rather than their murders. Unscrupulous advocates frequently misappropriate such situations as evidence for much-needed reforms in availability and quality of supports and services. These types of claims do little more than underline rhetoric that exculpates the perpetrators.  \r\n Alex Spourdalakis was not murdered because of a lack of services or because his caregivers were too stressed from living with him. He was murdered because he was autistic. \r\n \r\n Dog-whistle journalism. \u00a0I imagine Sharyl Attkisson is beyond shame, but CBS should have higher journalistic standards. \r\n Edited to add: someone questioned my about negative attitudes in the autism community about Ari Ne'eman. \u00a0Herewith, some comments: \r\n \r\n The claim that Ari Ne'eman has autism , is like the claim that Brian Deer is an \"award winning\" journalist.  \r\nOr that Paul Offit is one of the world's leading \"experts\" on autism. \r\nOr that Autism Speaks is a \"real\" autism advocacy organization. \r\nAnyone with a child on the spectrum, should know right right away that the Ari Ne'eman thing is just another cruel media concoction. I mean come on... the Autistic Self Advocacy Network ????? \r\nAnyone who has the presence of mind to 'self advocate', whatever the hell that even means, does not have autism. They have an acting job.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Previously: \r\n \u00a0 CBS's Sharyl Attkisson: This time, an apologist for murdering the disabled . \u00a0This post has links to as much of the commentary on Spourdalakis's death at the time, as well as current responses to CBS's Attkisson's biased coverage. \r\n\r\n \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.donotlink.com/JY", "http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Dog_whistle_politics", "http://autisticadvocacy.org/", "http://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ASAN-501c3-approval-letter.pdf", "http://www.guidestar.org/?", "http://www.donotlink.com/Lt", "http://www.donotlink.com/Lf", "http://autismwomensnetwork.org/node/1611", "http://www.donotlink.com/MQ"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2013/09/a-sidelight-on-sharyl-attkissons-spin-on-the-murder-of-alex-spourdulakis.html", "title": "A sidelight on Sharyl Attkisson's spin on the murder of Alex Spourdulakis, ASAN edition"},

{"date": "Monday, September 24, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t \r\n The American Academy of Pediatrics will publish  Autism Spectrum Disorders: What Every Parent Needs to Know \u00a0 on October 1. \u00a0(You can pre-order the book at the Amazon link above.) \r\n The first few weeks and months after a child's diagnosis with any disability is bewildering, but I think especially so for autism. \u00a0There's so much pressure to  do something, anything, now. \u00a0The  myth of the \"window of opportunity\"  to really make a difference in your child's future is particularly pernicious and panic-making, as is the \" autism cause of the day \"  drumbeat . \r\n I had two reactions to the AAP's calm, authoritative guide: \r\n \r\n It is a useful antidote to the bewilderment and pressure, in a format that harried parents can easily absorb, and \r\n It is terribly flawed, in that the editors ignored (or are ignorant of) the many helpful insights of autistic adults. \u00a0The book is much the weaker for the absence of autistic voices. \r\n \r\n \u00a0Topics covered include: \r\n \r\n A short, non-technical introduction to the history of autism, some typical early signs, and how it is diagnosed. \u00a0I particularly appreciated the clarification of differences and similaries between autism, Asperger's, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). \r\n A short and non-technical review of what is now known (and not known) about causation. \u00a0Particularly valuable is the discussion on why vaccines have been excluded as a cause. \r\n More detail on signs of autism, common health problems, \u00a0and how autism is diagnosed. \u00a0Particularly valuable are the lists of milestones \r\n How to develop and implement a management plan that meets your family's needs and your child's needs, including behavioral and developmental treatments. \u00a0Particularly valuable is the discussion of the various types of therapies and therapists. \r\n An introduction to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the autistic child in school, both therapies and challenges. \u00a0I found the short but pertinent discussion of IDEA a good introduction to the complexities of special education law. \r\n Other approaches to autism: medication and \"complimentary and alternative medicine\" (CAM). \u00a0I found the CAM discussion very helpful, in that it gives parents a grounding in how to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the myriad \"cures\" and \"treatments\" for autism available online. \r\n Defining \"the medical home\" and how to build and maintain a care notebook. The section on how to prepare for medical and dental visits was particularly well-done for parents of the newly-diagnosed. \r\n How to find and afford services and supports in your community. Particularly valuable to families with a new diagnosis are the guides to government financial assistance. \r\n Autism in adolescence and adulthood: creating the transition plan and more. One wise autism parent said that \"planning for adulthood begins in kindergarten\". \u00a0The brief roadmap in the book will help parents of young children to begin to think long-term. \r\n Strategies that other families have found helpful for common problems in autism. These few vignettes illustrate some creative solutions to sensory issues, troubles with transitions, and the like. \r\n Childhood autism and its effect upon siblings and family life. \u00a0I particularly appreciated the passage on resilience. \r\n Research directions: causation, prevention, and interventions. \u00a0The section on evaluating effectiveness of interventions is a particular interest of mine. \r\n How to advocate for autism. \u00a0The editors suggest that all parents could be advocates, in their own way. \r\n \r\n Now for the criticism. The book apparently had virtually no input from autistics. \u00a0The front matter lists \"parent reviewers /contributors\", but not \"autistic reviewers/contributors\". \u00a0 Yes, this is a book about autism in  children,  but autistic children grow up to be autistic adults. \u00a0Leaving autistic voices, in favor of parental voices or professional voices, \u00a0out implies that the editors believe that autistic adults have nothing useful to say, \r\n The book lists 11 \"autism champions\". \u00a0Of those,  \r\n \r\n 3 are autism researchers (Lord, Mason-Sears and Myles) \r\n 7 are autism parents (Pingree, Resnick, Singer, Smith, Sneid, Unub, and Wood) \r\n 1 is identified as autistic (Tim Page) \r\n \r\n \u00a0There are very many topics on which autistic adults have written insightful commentary. \u00a0Here are but a few pertinent examples, from hundreds or even thousands of posts. \r\n \r\n Judy Endow, MSW:  Preventing Meltdowns: Outsmarting the Explosive Behavior of Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders \r\n Julia Bascom:  Quiet Hands \u00a0(on the emotional and cognitive costs of some behavioral therapies) and a parent's response  Thoughts on Quiet Hands \r\n Corina Becker on  25 Things I Know as an Autistic Person \u00a0(especially on transition to adulthood) \r\n Ari Ne'eman on  The Value of Autistic Community \r\n Not only do autistic people date, they are parents:\u00a0\r\n \r\n Bridget on  How Autism Makes Me a Better Parent \r\n Melody Latimer at AS Parenting on  Get Your Priorities Straight \u00a0(on selecting goals for intervention) \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nI hope that if there's a second edition of this book, the editors will take care to include contributions from autistics.\r\n ( Disclosure: I was sent a review copy of this book.) \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Autism-Spectrum-Disorders-Every-Parent/dp/1581106513/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1348532587&sr=1-1&keywords=autism+spectrum+disorders+what+every+parent+needs+to+know", "http://autism.about.com/b/2007/09/27/breaking-through-the-window-of-opportunity-study-notes-that-symptoms-of-autism-improve-with-age.htm", "http://biologyfiles.fieldofscience.com/2011/10/this-just-in-being-alive-linked-to.html", "http://yeahgoodtimes.blogspot.com/2012/05/new-study-shows-autism-linked-to-moms.html", "http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2010/07/preventing-meltdowns-outsmarting.html", "http://www.shiftjournal.com/2011/10/27/quiet-hands/", "http://cynthiajpatton.com/2012/01/thoughts-on-quiet-hands/#.UGEYbdCXRrc", "http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2010/10/31/corina-becker-communication-shutdown-for-autism-awareness-no-thanks/", "http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2011/11/01/white-house-appointee-ari-neeman-on-the-power-of-autistic-community/", "http://itsbridgetsword.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/how-autism-makes-me-a-better-parent/", "http://www.asparenting.com/2012/07/24/dont-worry-hell-catch-up/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2012/09/not-quite-everything-parents-need-to-know-about-autism-spectrum-disorders.html", "title": "Not Quite Everything Parents Need to Know About Autism Spectrum Disorders"},

{"date": "Monday, September 02, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Back in March 2013,  Age of Autism ,  Lisa Joyce Goes  of The Thinking Moms' Revolution,\u00a0Jeanna Reed of  Autism is Medical , and Polly Tommey and Andrew Wakefield of the Autism Media Channel made much of an hospitalized autistic teen,\u00a0Alex\u00a0Spourdalakis, using his health woes to advance their own agendas.\u00a0 \r\n Wakefield and Tommey  shot videos of Alex ,\u00a0\u00a0showing him in  4-point restraints  and semi-nude with a diaper barely concealing his genitalia. \u00a0These videos were posted to YouTube, presumably with the consent of Dorothy Spourdalakis. Autism Media Channel is seeking to develop an  \"autism reality show\" ; the videos made of Alex would presumably be part of the show. After March 23, \u00a0these people -- so concerned-- appeared to drop the Spourdalakis family. Oh, there was that  tear-jerking video by Wakefield on May 23 , but actual published support? Nada.\u00a0 \r\n On June 9, Alex Spourdalakis was brutally murdered. \u00a0His mother and godmothers -- his caretakers -- have been charged. Sharyl Attkisson, a CBS reporter, \u00a0has a history of reporting as if she is deep in the pockets of the anti-vaccine, autism-hating movement. \u00a0On August 30, 2013, in a report entitled,  Film provides glimpse into life of autistic teen killed by his mother , \u00a0Attkisson became an apologist for accused killers Dorothy Spourdalakis and Jolanta Agata Skordzka, who had first drugged Alex\u00a0Spourdalakis , and when he didn't die fast enough, stabbed him repeatedly and hacked his hand nearly off.\u00a0 \r\n The report featured clips from a documentary-in-progress, produced by something called  Autism Media Channel , which is  Polly Tommey 's and  Andrew Wakefield 's enterprise for spreading fear, \u00a0uncertainty, and doubt about vaccines, and to denigrate autistics and spread fear of autism. \u00a0 \r\n The purpose of the CBS report was to paint\u00a0Spourdalakis and Skordzka as victims of \"the system\".  Attkisson quotes uncritically Tommey's claim: \r\n \r\n \"Dorothy was like any other autism mother, desperate to get help for her child,\" Polly Tommey, who is producing Alex's story for the channel, told CBS News' Sharyl Attkisson. \r\n \"His death didn't need to be,\" Tommey, who is the mother of an autistic son herself, said. \"It was because there wasn't anything in place for him.\" \r\n \r\n No, Dorothy Spourdalakis isn't like other autism mothers. \u00a0She refused appropriate services and medical care, demanded inappropriate medical care, and ultimately murdered her son after a week of planning the crime. \r\n Notice what Tommey said. \u00a0She is not placing the responsiblity for Alex's death on his mother and godmother, but on a \"lack of services.\" \u00a0How callous can you get? \u00a0It isn't even factual. \r\n Mary Kay Betz, is the executive director of the  Autism Society of Illinois , in March went to the hospital to offer  support and services to Alex and his mother.   \r\n \r\nBetz recalled how she told Dorothy Spourdalakis that, although she couldn't promise her state money, she would do whatever she could to help get the support the mother needed. Spourdalakis said all she wanted was an attorney. Betz found a lawyer and thought the boy's mother was doing better. Then she learned that Alex had been stabbed to death in his bed.\r\n \r\n According to a l ocal report, Alex's\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Family members refused DCFS referrals to community-based services ranging from respite to psychological counseling, said Dave Clarkin, DCFS spokesman. \r\n \r\n While he was alive, Alex Spourdalakis was used by anti-vaccine activists to promote their beliefs about vaccines and autism.  Now he is again being used by the same individuals, with Sharyl Attkisson's collusion. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Text: ACTION ALERT!!!!! Watch this important story about the medical neglect  of Alex Spourdalakis. Please call CBS viewer line at 212-975-3247 to let them know how much we appreciate this important factual coverage of Alex's journey to get the same health care as all other children. Alex's bowel disease was ignored and he was illegally restrained without doctor's orders!!!!!!!!!!! Share and retweet. Let Sharyl Attkisson know how much we needed this important story and how grateful we are that she covered the FACTS. Let CBS know we need MORE!!!!!!!\r\n \r\n The Facebook post above is from a group of three women,\u00a0Jill Rubolino, Amanda Lochbaum, and Jeanna Reed, who have formed a support group for parents called \" Autism Is Medical \". Back in 2009, the trio had planned to  start a company \u00a0flogging \"autism recovery\", but four years on, it is  just a series of meetings .\u00a0\u00a0 Jeanna Reed visited with Dorothy\u00a0Spourdalakis while Alex was hospitalized, and  encouraged her to distrust Alex's care team and refuse the care Alex's medical team was planning. \u00a0 \r\n \r\n \r\n Text: Alex Spourdalakis. May he never be forgotten.  May his story serve to remind us... we need each other. We can't do this alone. These children and their families need help/support. I never want to hear about another tragedy like this one as long as I live. \r\n Please call CBS and tell them we appreciate autism related stories at 212-975-3247. We have to keep autism in the headlines. Keep telling your stories. We are making a difference! \r\n \r\n The Facebook post above is by The Thinking Moms' Revolution, a group of autism-hating, anti-vaccine mothers who believe autism is vaccine injury. \u00a0Lisa Joyce Goes is a founding member, and was one of the people telling Dorothy Spourdalikis that her son could be \"cured\" of autism if only he recieved the correct treatment. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nText: thinkingmoms \u200f@thinkingmomsrev 30 Aug\r\n \r\n ACTION ALERT: Sharyl Atkinson has asked that we all call CBS and tell them that we appreciate autism related...  \r\n http://fb.me/Wl4wsz5m  \r\n  \r\n Retweeted by Autism is Medical  \r\n More\r\n CBS News\r\n View this content on CBS News's website\r\nBehind the tragedy: Mother murders autistic son\r\nA new documentary produced by the Autism Media Channel shares a wrenching glimpse of a desperate mother who murdered her 14-year-old autistic son, Alex Spourdalakis.

CBS and Autism Media Channel Present a Prelude to Tragedy \r\n In an unprecedented insight into the apparently senseless and violent death of Alex Spourdalakis, a 14 year-old boy with autism, CBS in collaboration with Austin-based Autism Media Channel presents a game-changer \u2013 intimate documentary footage of the unfolding crime. \r\n Autism Media Channel: Alex was one of millions of children at risk. Without a complete overhaul of our approach to autism treatments, therapies, and services, tragedies like this are inevitable. \r\n CBS This Morning (PRWEB) September 01, 2013 \r\n Where: CBS THIS MORNING  \r\n When: Friday August 30, 2013, 8.00 am EST \r\n In a country where 1 in 25 children born today will develop autism, this compelling story is certain to create universal debate. Alex\u2019s tragedy is a story of our time, pitting the old against the new, capturing the iniquity of autism when perceived as a psychiatric oddity rather than a medical disease - an epidemic in an unprepared world. Using exclusive footage that followed Alex\u2019s journey leading up to his death, CBS and Autism Media Channel present a story, unique in documentary history \u2013 one whose outcome should have been prevented; one that will change perception. \r\n Polly Tommey, autism advocate, Autism Media Channel director, and founder of The Autism Trust, says the answers are staring us in the face. \"Alex was one of millions of children at risk,\" she said. \"Without a complete overhaul of our approach to autism treatments, therapies, and services, tragedies like this are inevitable.\" \r\n For interviews with Autism Media Channel and professional enquiries please contact Ryan Parmenter at Modern Panda Pubic Relations on 512 797 2219 or email ryan(at)modernpandapr(dot)com. \r\n MISSED IT!

Kudos to PEN for putting on such a dynamic and information-rich day.\u00a0 \r\n One focus was on exhibitors of technologies focusing on special education students' needs. \u00a0 \r\n I stopped by the BrainAid suite and had a lively conversation about executive function and technological supports with Brain Aid's president, Rich Levinson. \u00a0 \r\n Levinson was a robotics researcher at NASA-Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. In the early 1990s, Levinson began studying the neuropsychology of human planning -- executive function--in order to increase autonomy for NASA robots such as the Mars Rover. \u00a0 \r\n  In 1995, Levinson proposed a computer model of human frontal lobe function. That computer model led to the development of \u00a0the\u00a0Planning and Execution Assistant and Trainer -- PEAT\u2122. \u00a0 It is an \u00a0Android-based application that aids individuals with memory, attention and cognitive disorders.  \r\n PEAT was originally designed for brain injury rehabilitation -- specificially traumatic brain injury with the Veterans' Administration-- but has been used by many people with nearly all forms of cognitive impairment including mild cognitive impairment, early dementia, stroke, autism, ADHD, PTSD, hypoxia and others. \r\n Right now, BrainAid is working with a Santa Clara County school district to build PEAT's capability to help students with executive function dysfunction (conditions such as autism and ADHD) be more successful academically. \r\n I can see the PEAT device, with modifications, also being very useful for autistic adults, who often have executive function challenges that reduce quality of life. \u00a0I like the way BrainAid puts \"autonomy\" front and center -- \"autonomy is our core value\". \u00a0 \r\n Kassiane  wrote a nifty article on \" Autistifying My Habitat \"that illustrates her low-tech way of overcoming some of the executive function challenges particular to her and her living situation. \u00a0Karla Fisher has a number of reflections on autistic executive function, but  this essay is a great place to start. \r\n PEAT training videos \u00a0 \r\n BrainAid on Twitter\u00a0 \r\n BrainAid on Facebook \r\n BrainAid on Pinterst \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.parentseducationnetwork.org/", "http://www.edrevsf.org/about/", "http://timetolisten.blogspot.com/2012/08/autistifying-my-habitat.html", "http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2012/08/autistifying-my-habitat.html", "http://asdculture.wikispaces.com/My+Time+Management+EF+Strategies", "http://brainaid.com/peat-training/", "https://twitter.com/PEATbyBrainaid", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/PEAT-by-BrainAid/50486319799?fref=ts", "http://pinterest.com/peatbybrainaid/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2013/04/edrev-2013-brainaids-peat-device.html", "title": "EdRev 2013:  BrainAid's PEAT Device, or Cognitive Orthotics"},

{"date": "Wednesday, April 17, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t The UK's  Daily Mail  (or the Daily Fail) continues to be a primary contributor to the  outbreak of vaccine-preventable disease in the UK , and the  thoroughly discredited notion that autism is somehow connected to recept of the measles vaccine .\u00a0 \r\n An example of the Daily Mail's continuing malign influence popped up just today. There's a gullible, science-rejecting UK organization called  Treating Autism , which has a  Facebook page . \u00a0Here's what they posted on Facebook today: \r\n \r\n Sadly, the article posted is over 10 years old. One would expect that an organization called \"Treating Autism\" would have recognized Melanie Phillips's old, debunked spew, but perhaps the Facebook page is in the hands of a parent new to this issue.  \r\n Here's a clue. \u00a0As I wrote  two years ago , the  Daily Mail  does not accurately date-stamp articles online.  It's the  Daily Mail  eternal present. Here's an image of article that Treating Autism linked to.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n A few seconds' research shows that Melanie Phillips' article was  published the week of March 11,  2003 . \r\n \r\n I really wonder why the folks at Treating Autism didn't bother to check if the Phillips article was new. \u00a0It only took me a few seconds to find Michael Fitzpatrick's article \r\n \r\n \r\n Phillips' encouragement for the increasingly irrational and irresponsible anti-MMR campaign is likely to compound the unwarranted anxieties of parents whose infants are due to be immunised and result in a further decline in vaccine uptake. It will also intensify the distress of parents of autistic children, whose burden is now increased by feelings of guilt for having them immunised. \r\n While ill-advised parents of autistic children pursue litigation against vaccine manufacturers - with negligible chances of success - doctors apprehensively await the  return of serious infectious diseases that we only recently believed were on the verge of disappearance. \r\n \r\n 10 years on, and the measles epidemic in Wales shows that Dr. Fitzpatrick was right \r\n \r\n Here are some questions for Melanie Phillips. \r\n If Dr Wakefield has 'evidence that he thinks will prove that he was right all along', then why does he choose to disclose this in the Daily Mail rather than in a medical journal in which it can be properly evaluated by his peers? \r\n Wakefield has repeatedly promoted claims in public - at congressional hearings in the USA, on a BBC Panorama programme in 2002 - which have not held up to subsequent scrutiny. It would appear that Wakefield, having consistently failed to convince his peers of his case, has decided to present it directly to the public, via compliant journalists who lack the scientific expertise to assess the validity of his claims. The result is that, while Wakefield is no longer taken seriously in the world of medical science, he is still effective in provoking public anxiety. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health/measles-recorded-every-health-board-2635589", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2013/04/09/stephen-bustin-why-there-is-no-link-between-measles-virus-and-autism/", "http://www.treatingautism.co.uk/", "https://www.facebook.com/treatingautism?fref=ts", "http://melaniephillips.com/the-mmr-controversy-an-investigation-part-one"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2013/04/another-patsy-of-the-daily-mails-sorry-continuing-contribution-to-vaccine-autism-fear.html", "title": "Another Patsy of The Daily Mail's Sorry Continuing Contribution to Vaccine, Autism Fear"},

Evidence-based interventions for teaching writing to students across the autism spectrum will be reviewed, to enable participants to identify the practices that will be effective with their students. Drs. Delano and Pennington also will present instructional strategies shown to improve writing skills, including response-prompting procedures and computer-assisted instruction. They will discuss evidence based practices for assisting students in developing basic writing skills (e.g., labeling, sentence writing), as well as strategies for developing more complex writing skills, such as composing stories and writing essays. In addition, they will discuss the process and techniques involved in   monitoring student progress. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cec.sped.org/Professional-Development/Events-Calendar/WEB1313?utm_source=cec&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=WEB1313&utm_content=%231", "http://imis.cec.sped.org/cec_prod/EventDetail?WebsiteKey=269141f1-45d0-49b9-9769-40de3a48419c&EventKey=WEB1313"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2013/04/fyi-webinar-teaching-written-expression-to-students-with-autism-spectrum-disorders-may-16-2013.html", "title": "FYI Webinar Teaching Written Expression to Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders  May 16 2013"},

Autism Positivity explains \r\n \r\n \r\n Last year hundreds of bloggers came together in a show of support and solidarity in response to an anonymous person\u2019s Google search \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have Aspergers\u201d. The posts that came flooding in from all over the world were a beautiful example of the power of strength in numbers. With so much negativity still surrounding Autism and the misinformation and misconceptions that continue to abound, we invite each of you to share one, or two, or more \u201cAusome\u201d things! \r\n \r\n \r\n I've been turning this over in my mind for the last month.  I hear many adult autistics writing about how April is a hard month, like  Karla Fisher on Facebook \r\n \r\nIRL Status: I have come to the conclusion that April is not a month for me to do Autism stuff. ;) I am not strong enough. The good news is that there are significantly more of us autistics speaking against the flood of crappy Autism messaging and they are strong enough. The parent allies are also increasing in numbers. The bad news is there is still a flood of crappy messaging and we are in a place as a people where acceptance is so far away. It makes life for those of us living it, so hard every day and still it continues...\r\n \r\n I thought I would focus on gratitude.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 07, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Back in February 2013,  Woman With Asperger's  ( Nicole Nicholson , poet and thinker-at-large) started a series on the artist Paul Robeson, Asperger's, and the African-American experience.  \r\n \r\n This month, I\u2019m going to explore Robeson \u2014 who he was an an artist and a person, and through the lens of Asperger\u2019s. Robeson was born in 1898 and died shortly before I was born (January 1976). I wonder \u2014 and would like to explore \u2014 about the reality he encountered as an African-American autistic in the early part of the twentieth century, and how that reality compares to the reality I encounter today as a multiracial African-American autistic. \r\n And of course, this exploration will lead me to related questions. I know I am not the only African-American autistic out there. In my journeys over the last three years I have encountered some wonderful individuals, including record producer and autism advocate Michael Buckholtz. Logic dictates that he, I, and the few other individuals I have met cannot possibly be the only African-American Aspies out there. The big question in this case is: where ARE we? Through a bit of exploration, I hopefully may find some general answers (while being careful to respect the privacy of those who cannot be \u201cout\u201d) this month. \r\n \r\n The series: \r\n \r\n The Souls of Black Autistic Folk: A Prelude to the Journey \r\n The Souls of Black Autistic Folk, Part I: An Introduction to Paul Robeson \r\n The Souls of Black Autistic Folk, Part II: Paul Robeson, the Aspie? \r\n The Souls of Black Autistic Folk, Part III: Difference and the Question of Visibility \r\n \r\n Nicholson  concludes with these thoughts \r\n \r\n As we move between the realities of being African-American and autistic, we each need to decide what we do with them. Do we merge them, as DuBois suggests? Do we compartmentalize them? Do we find a way to achieve a healthy synthesis of the two that will promote greater understanding of autism in the Black community as well as of African-American autistics themselves? \r\n I know that I am a Black autistic soul. I happen to be one which whips language and words around her tongue and slides them out through her pen. I happen to be one with a collection of my own narrow/special interests, talents, and philosophies. I happen to be one who is still healing from the effects of childhood bullying. But I know I am not the only one. \r\n \r\n If you would like to read more from Nicole: \r\n \r\n Woman with Asperger's  blog \r\n Twitter:  @aspergerwoman \r\n \r\n For those of you who aren't sure who Paul Robeson was: athlete, attorney, actor, singer, political activist: \r\n.\r\n \r\n From the  introduction to Robeson's testimony at HUAC \r\n \r\n\tMany African-American witnesses subpoenaed to testify at the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) hearings in the 1950s were asked to denounce Paul Robeson (1888\u20131976) in order to obtain future employment. Robeson, an All-American football player and recipient of a Phi Beta Kappa key at Rutgers, received a law degree at Columbia. He became an internationally acclaimed concert performer and actor as well as a persuasive political speaker. In 1949, Robeson was the subject of controversy after newspapers reports of public statements that African Americans would not fight in \u201can imperialist war.\u201d In 1950, his passport was revoked. Several years later, Robeson refused to sign an affidavit stating that he was not a Communist and initiated an unsuccessful lawsuit. In the following testimony to a HUAC hearing, ostensibly convened to gain information regarding his passport suit, Robeson refused to answer questions concerning his political activities and lectured bigoted Committee members Gordon H. Scherer and Chairman Francis E.Walter about African-American history and civil rights. In 1958, the Supreme Court ruled that a citizen\u2019s right to travel could not be taken away without due process and Robeson\u2019 passport was returned.\r\n \r\nThe PBS \"American Masters\"  episode on Paul Robeson .\r\n (note to those new here: I also use this blog as a personal aide-memoire) \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://womanwithaspergers.wordpress.com/", "http://womanwithaspergers.wordpress.com/about/", "http://womanwithaspergers.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/the-souls-of-black-autistic-folk-a-prelude-to-the-journey/", "http://womanwithaspergers.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/the-souls-of-black-autistic-folk-part-i-an-introduction-to-paul-robeson/", "http://womanwithaspergers.wordpress.com/2013/02/20/the-souls-of-black-autistic-folk-part-ii-paul-robeson-the-aspie/", "http://womanwithaspergers.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/the-souls-of-black-autistic-folk-part-iii-difference-and-the-question-of-visibility/", "http://womanwithaspergers.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/the-souls-of-black-autistic-folk-part-iii-difference-and-the-question-of-visibility/", "http://womanwithaspergers.wordpress.com/", "https://twitter.com/aspergerwoman", "http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6440", "http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/paul-robeson/about-the-actor/66/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2013/05/the-souls-of-black-autistic-folk.html", "title": "The Souls of Black Autistic Folk: A Series by Nicole Nicholson"},

{"date": "Monday, May 20, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Over the weekend, I hosted a party honoring my darling daughter's graduation from university. \u00a0It was a lovely event, with family and friends from near and far coming together to celebrate. \u00a0Over the years, Jumper Girl has been blessed with a number of caregivers, with whom we are happily still in touch. \u00a0Many of them were at the party. \r\n \r\n Of course we were telling stories. \u00a0One story was the time that Jumper Girl, age about 2, escaped from our secure back yard, when my back was turned for just a minute. \u00a0At that time, \u00a0we were putting jingle bells on her shoes, because she had developed the vexing habit of running away and hiding, especially in the house. \u00a0 At the time of this story, we were outside, and I think I had bent over to pull a weed or something. \u00a0When I looked up, she was nowhere in sight, and the gate, which I swore she couldn't open, stood ajar. Worse yet, her be-jingled shoes, which I believed she was incapable of removing on her own, were lying in the middle of the lawn. \r\n I think every parent, if they were honest with themselves, has had such moments with their children. \u00a0You know, the ones where the child demonstrates some new skill in such a way that places the child at risk, if not outright danger. \u00a0 \r\n This last week has been a particularly haunting one in that respect for the autism community. \u00a0On May 12, 2012, nine-year-old Mikaela Lynch managed to get out of her secure back yard and vanished. \u00a0She was found dead in a nearby creek on May 15. \u00a0On May 19, \u00a0eight-year-old Owen Black somehow slipped out the beach condo where his family was staying and was later found drowned in\u00a0Perdido Key. \u00a0 Age of Autism is reporting that a third child,  Drew Howell , also slipped out of his parent's house and was found within minutes. \u00a0Sadly, Drew had drowned. Mikaela and Owen were autistic, non-speaking, and by all reports, \u00a0had the obliviousness to danger that some autistic children exhibit. \u00a0 The thing about autism though, is that many autistics exhibit developmental delay. \u00a0Pay attention: delay. \u00a0Skills do develop, only on a different timetable than expected. \u00a0Parents and caregivers can be taken by surprise by a sudden jump in skills. \r\n A friend of mine who has a child, Frank*, \u00a0much like Mikaela and Owen, \u00a0told me a story a while ago. \u00a0Their backyard was they thought doubly secure, with locking features that Frank couldn't reach, and that were beyond (they thought) his fine motor skills. \u00a0One fine day, while his mother wasn't looking, he reached over and handily undid the latch. \u00a0What had happened? \u00a0Oh, all the work his PT and OT had been doing on gross and fine motor skills paid off. \u00a0He had learned to balance on tiptoe, and had mastered the snap lock. Fortunately, his mother heard the gate open and had caught up with Frank before he got into any danger. \u00a0  While the search for Mikaela was going on, many of my \u00a0friends who are parents of autistic children -- some like Mikaela and Owen, others who have more of a sense of danger and less likelyhood to wander off -- wrote  again  and  again  about their own close calls with a child escaping, despite extreme care and hypervigilance. \r\n While Mikaela was missing, there were some who said said vile things about the Lynch family. \r\n One of the autism parent bloggers  decided that must not stand, and organized a blog drive for today, \" An Outpouring of Love for the Mikaela Lynch Family \". \u00a0You can peruse a list of posts at\u00a0 http://www.blenza.com/linkies/links.php?owner=sunday75&postid=19May2013 . \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n My heart aches for each family -- the Lynches, the Blacks, and the Howells. Each of those children had teachers and helpers and therapists who also are suffering. \u00a0To lose a child.... \u00a0The pain is unspeakable. \u00a0To those who loved Mikaela, Owen, and Drew, I am so, so sorry for your losses. \r\n There is a website honoring Mikaela's memory,\u00a0 http://mlvillage.org/ \r\n \r\n We are a community of Mikaela\u2019s family and close friends that are dedicated to the life and love of Mikaela Lynch. This wonderful girl has touched so many lives around the globe. It is our intent to continue to spread the love that Mikaela shared liberally. We hope to have your help in our mission.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n The local paper, the Lake County News,  reported that  \r\n \r\n The site includes a donation link. One of the child\u2019s teachers, Alyssa Winn, reported that Mikaela\u2019s family currently is choosing a foundation \u2013 likely one benefiting children with autism \u2013 in order to make a donation in her name. \r\n \r\n Oh, the end of the Jumper Girl story? \u00a0We were lucky. I went around the west side of the house, but she had gone around the east side. Just as she got to the driveway, one of the caregivers arrived and apprehended her. \u00a0We upgraded the escape prevention that day, and now it is one of those family stories....that families tell each other for fun, but also as a reminder. \u00a0It could have been my child. ----- \r\n * pseudonym\u00a0 Image source:  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gate_ajar.jpg\u00a0 \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.giveforward.com/fundraiser/wnd2/in-memory-of-drew-howell", "http://www.extremeparenthood.com/2013/05/it-could-be-my-child-on-that-poster.html", "http://sleepdeprivationdiaries.blogspot.com/2013/05/dear-lynch-and-black-and-howell-family.html", "http://www.extremeparenthood.com/2013/05/honoring-mikaelalynch.html", "https://www.facebook.com/events/623837284312973/", "http://www.blenza.com/linkies/links.php?owner=sunday75&postid=19May2013", "http://mlvillage.org/", "http://www.lakeconews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=31278:memorial-web-site-launched-for-mikaela-lynch&catid=1:latest&Itemid=197", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gate_ajar.jpg"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2013/05/i-blinked-and-she-was-gone.html", "title": "I blinked and she was gone"},
{"date": "Sunday, February 02, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t The short answer is no. Toxins have not been shown to cause autism. The longer answer is that approaches to autism that seek to repair non-existent 'toxicity' are heavily marketed, despite having no evidence of efficacy and being dangerous to those receiving those treatments. \r\n We reviewed the evidence for  'leaky gut' in autism and found it false . \u00a0We reviewed the idea that  autistic folk have detectible levels of 'toxins' in their brains or blood , and found it false.\u00a0 \r\n The Association for Science in Autism Treatment (ASAT) has  published a succinct survey of what is known about the causes of autism: \r\n \r\n At this time, the exact cause of autism remains uncertain, but research suggests that any one of several factors may be involved in its onset: genetic factors, possible environmental influences; certain types of infections; problems before, during, or after birth. Some studies suggest the possibility of a disruption of very early brain development, before birth. \r\n There is extensive past and ongoing research intending to delineate the causes of autism. \r\n Increased frequency of occurrence of autism within families supports a probable genetic contribution to the disorder; however, it is very unlikely that any one single genetic defect will explain all cases of autism. Observations that the identical twins of an individual with autism has only about a 60% chance of also having autism, lead to the conclusion that genetics alone do not explain the condition. Ongoing research is seeking to find out if a genetic predisposition to autism may be triggered to develop into autism by the occurrence of certain environmental, infectious, immunological, and other conditions or events. \r\n At this time, there is no evidence that specific toxins in the environment, immunization practices, dietary differences, or immunologic differences cause autism. It is quite likely that some combination of genetic, neuropathologic, and environmental agents will explain the etiology of autism, and that the etiology may vary from one individual to another. \r\n \r\n Nonetheless, there are people who believe that autism is caused by 'toxicity', which can be diagnosed using various urine, blood, stool, and hair tests; the problems the tests reveal can be addressed by various treatments. \u00a0People holding this set of beliefs are roughly referred to as the \"autism biomedical movement. \" \r\n The invalidity of one type of tests has been discussed in depth by Stephen Barrett MD in\u00a0 How the \"Urine Toxic Metals\" Test Is Used to Defraud Patients \r\n Physician-researcher David Gorski MD wrote , about \"biomedical autism treatments\" \r\n \r\n These ideas are dangerous because they have direct consequences for children with autism. These consequences take the form of subjecting children to unscientific treatments that are ineffective at best and harmful at worst, sometimes even life-threatening.... \r\n Autistic children have paid the price. They will continue to pay the price until somehow, some way, science-based medicine, rather than anecdote- and pseudoscience-based medicine can prevail. Autistic children deserve no less than the best scientific medicine that can be brought to bear on helping them to develop and alleviating their symptoms. They most certainly don\u2019t deserve the unethical and uncontrolled experimentation to which far too many of them are being subjected. \r\n \r\n Matt Carey  pointed out that the autism biomedical industry is entirely unregulated  and does not even collect data on adverse reactions to biomedical treatments. \r\n \r\n .....are people being given the ability to make an informed decision about alternative medical treatments used for autism? The answer is simple as well: no. They are not. \r\n \r\n Back in 2009, the blog Left Brain / Right Brain published  a list of biomedical autism treatments as seen through the postings of one family. \r\n \r\n But behind the scientific and legal consensus that vaccines do not cause autism lies a hidden world, the autism \u201cbiomedical\u201d yahoo- and chat-group world. There is no decline in the number of posts in this world. It\u2019s a thriving, and growing community, one that has fueled the popularity of the anti-vaxers, and the certainty of those parents who consider their child \u201cvaccine-injured\u201d. It has spurred the spending of millions of dollars on supplements, hyperbaric treatments, off-label prescription medications, and myriad other autism \u201cbiomedical treatments\u201d. These \u201ctreatments\u201d are almost all of no proven benefit, some are ridiculous, some relatively benign, and many potentially dangerous. This article will explore the journey of one mother, \u201cMary\u201d in her efforts to cure her son \u201cSaul\u201d. While the case of Mary and Saul, documented in her own words is shocking and appalling, Mary is not alone nor is she an extreme case. She is one of thousands of parents seeking autism \u201cbiomedical treatments\u201d on the internet. \r\n \r\n The Autism Science Foundation has published a non-exhaustive list of such treatments \r\n \r\n Biomedical Non-Evidence-Based Treatments \r\n Chelation: Chelation therapy involves administering chemicals designed to bind to heavy metals and eliminate them from the body. Chelating agents have a legitimate use in the treatment of poisoning from lead, mercury and other metals. There is no evidence that supports chelation as a safe treatment alternative because autism is not caused by metal poisoning. In 2005, a child with autism died from chelation therapy, when the chelating agent bonded with calcium in his body and caused his heart to stop. No paper published in the peer-reviewed literature has reported abnormal levels of mercury in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Moreover, symptoms of mercury poisoning are unlike symptoms of autism, making chelation an impractical way to improve symptoms. \r\n Lupron Therapy: Lupron is a testosterone-inhibiting drug used in the treatment of precocious puberty (which is rare) and prostate cancer, as well as for the \u201cchemical castration\u201d of sex offenders. Its use for autism is based on the hypothesis that testosterone magnifies the toxic effects of mercury (see above). There is no evidence that Lupron is safe or effective for the treatment of autism. In addition, it can have harmful side effects including hives, difficulty breathing/ swallowing, numbness, tingling, weakness, painful or difficult urination, blood in the urine, bone pain, testicular pain and osteoporosis. \r\n Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT): HBOT has been proven effective for treatment of gangrene, carbon monoxide poisoning, \u201cthe bends\u201d and various other conditions related to oxygen in blood. There is no evidence to support ASD as an insufficiency of oxygen in the blood. Evidence also fails to support HBOT as safe or effective for the treatment of autism. Furthermore, the benefits of hyperbaric oxygen delivered in a soft-shelled chamber are no different than with a less expensive oxygen tent, or nasal cannula. \r\n Gluten Free-Casein Free (GFCF) Diet: Those who promote gluten (protein found in wheat, rye, and barley products) and casein (protein found in dairy products) free diets claim that children with autism have \"leaky guts\" that allow opioids to escape into the bloodstream and then travel to the brain and cause autistic behaviors. There is no evidence for this claim, and studies have found that compared to typically developing children, children with autism have no more opioids in their blood. Furthermore, children on the GFCF diet have been found to have lower bone density than controls, which could lead to osteoporosis. A large-scale study of the safety and efficacy of the GFCF diet indicated that children on the diet had similar outcomes to those who were not on the diet. \r\n Stem Cell Therapy: Stem cell therapy for autism is illegal in the United States, but that hasn\u2019t stopped some from offering this as a treatment for autism in Costa Rica, China, and other countries. There is no evidence that the treatment is safe or effective for autism, and no guarantee that the stem cells used in these countries are even human. \r\n Secretin Injections: Secretin is a hormone that controls digestion. It is currently prepared from pigs as a synthetic human form is not available. The FDA has approved use of single doses of secretin in diagnosing gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers or impaired pancreatic function in adults, but it has not formally approved the hormone for autism treatment. No data exists on the safety or efficacy of repeated doses of secretin or its use in children. In a report, the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development states that the efficacy of secretin in ASD treatment is currently unknown. \r\n Antifungal Agent Therapy: Some people believe that bacteria in the gut cause autism, and since antifungal medications can eliminate bacteria they believe they can simultaneously cure autism. There is no evidence to support any antifungal agent as an autism cure. Importantly, treating children with antifungal agents is potentially harmful; possible side effects include itching, irritation, burning, diarrhea, stomach pain, and skin rashes. Some antifungal treatments, including Diflucan, Sporanox, Lamisil, and Nizoral, are absorbed in the body and can impede liver functioning over time. \r\n Vitamin Supplements: It is important to maintain a healthy and balanced diet. To achieve this goal, healthcare providers may recommend nutritional supplements to people with and without autism. Use of supplements can be problematic however, when they are misused in an attempt to cure an individual of autism. There is no scientific evidence suggesting that vitamin supplements can cure autism. Using supplements without consulting a healthcare provider can be dangerous. Some supplements (e.g., vitamin A) can be toxic when taken in high doses for sustained periods; others may not contain what they claim. \r\n Raw Camel Milk: Raw camel milk has been alleged to cure autism-related ills with benefits ranging from improved eye contact and motor skills to decreased inflammation. Although it may be nutritious, there is no scientific research that upholds claims that raw camel milk is an autism \u201ccure-all.\u201d \r\n Marijuana Therapy: Marijuana is an illicit drug whose use in ASD treatment is neither medically nor scientifically supported. Reported short-term side effects of marijuana use include distorted perception; impaired coordination; and impaired thinking, problem solving, learning and memory. Long-term marijuana use has been associated with decreased learning abilities, increased risk of respiratory diseases associated with smoking, and decreased motivation. \r\n Nicotine Patch Therapy: Research studies have uncovered abnormalities in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brains of people with autism, and some scientists have posited that core symptoms of ASD could be attributed to these alterations. Some findings specifically indicate a shortage of these receptors, leading some to believe that stimulating or increasing these receptors could eliminate ASD symptoms. Proponents of nicotine patch use in individuals with ASD believe that the nicotine released into the body from the patch activates and upregulates receptors, and thereby reduces ASD symptoms. Despite having a rationale that is based on scientific findings, use of this treatment is not supported by scientific evidence. No clinical trials have demonstrated that nicotine patches are safe or effective in the treatment of ASD. Common side effects reported in clinical studies evaluating safety and efficacy of the patches include skin irritation; sleep problems, including insomnia and nightmares; headaches, indigestion, and nervousness. \r\n Bleach Therapy: In bleach therapy, an individual with ASD is given a diluted form of bleach orally or through an enema in an attempt to cure their symptoms. Bleach doses are given repeatedly; supporters of this treatment have recommended that children drink the bleach mixture up to eight times per day or receive an enema up to three times per week. The rationale for the treatment is that bleach can eliminate bacteria, parasites, yeast, and heavy metals and consequently eliminate ASD symptoms. This treatment has been widely denounced for the harm it can cause as well as its complete lack of scientific basis. Ingesting bleach can lead to severe fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and other complications. \r\n Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: TMS is a procedure in which magnetic fields are used to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to enhance or reduce certain functions. TMS is currently used to treat mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. The most commonly reported short-term side effects include headaches and scalp discomfort. Therapeutic TMS is relatively new so long-term side effects, if any, are unknown. Investigations into the efficacy of TMS in ASD treatment are currently underway, but presently there is no evidence to support its use. \r\n Psychological and Behavioral Non-Evidence-Based Treatments \r\n Therapeutic Horseback Riding: Horseback-riding therapy for individuals with ASD aims to foster motor, communication, and social skills, while improving responses to external stimuli. Although a few studies touting the benefits of therapeutic riding have been published in peer-reviewed journals, they are either mainly descriptive, involve small samples or rely on poor outcome measures, and thus cannot support the therapy as a useful, evidence-based intervention. \r\n Dolphin-Assisted Therapy: When undergoing dolphin-assisted therapy (DAT), an individual with autism swims, touches, and interacts with dolphins. Alleged benefits of dolphin therapy include improved emotional control and communication skills, as well as increased attention. Some proponents also claim that the emotional experience created by DAT helps individuals become more receptive to more conventional treatments. There is no scientific evidence suggesting that DAT is efficacious in the long-term improvement of ASD symptoms. Moreover, DAT involves significant safety risks given that dolphins are powerful animals that are capable of harming humans despite extensive training. \r\n Prism Glasses: Prism glasses alter the visual perception of individuals with ASD and are thought to improve behavior and challenging vision-related symptoms as a result. Supporters believe that some individuals with ASD suffer from distorted perception and compensate using abnormal movements and postures such as head tilting. Prism glasses aim to ameliorate perceptual distortions and aid visual development. Their purported benefits extend to other areas, including spatial localization, visual awareness, decrease in sensory seeking behaviors, organization, gait, eye contact, mood, facial expressions, and fine and gross motor skills. Unfortunately these benefits have no scientific backing; no studies with strong experimental designs have supported the use of this expensive therapy in individuals with autism. \r\n Music Therapy: Music therapy aims to mitigate cognitive, behavioral, social, and sensory-motor impairments in individuals with ASD. Although music therapy may be rewarding for individuals with ASD, there is no strong scientific evidence for its efficacy in improving functioning. \r\n Holding Therapy: Holding therapy is based on the erroneous notion that autism is a disorder of attachment caused by a parent\u2019s failure to bond with their child. In a holding therapy session, a caregiver physically restrains a child with autism in order to force eye contact and repair attachment. This treatment has been deemed ineffective and dangerous. There is no scientific evidence suggesting that holding therapy works and fatalities have resulted from its use. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.asatonline.org/about_autism/causesautism", "http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/urine_toxic.html", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-autism-biomed-movement-uncontrolled-and-unethical-experimentation-on-autistic-children/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2012/09/21/adverse-reaction-data-for-alternative-therapies-for-autism/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/09/23/truth-and-consequences-the-anti-vaccination-movement-exacts-a-price/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2014/02/is-it-true-that-toxicity-causes-autism-.html", "title": "Is It True That 'Toxicity' Causes Autism?

Pediatrics. 2003 Sep;112(3 Pt 1):604-6 . \r\n \r\n To paraphrase David Gorski, writing at Science-Based Medicine,\u00a0 The curious case of Poul Thorsen, fraud and embezzlement, and the Danish vaccine-autism studies : \r\n First, you need to understand the importance of the order of names in scientific and medical studies. The order of the authors' names is significant in scientific and medical studies. In straight science studies, the two most important authors are usually the first author and the last author. The last author is usually the senior author in whose laboratory the work was done, while the first author is the person whose project the work represents and who was the primary author of the manuscript. In medical papers (such as those published in  Pediatrics  or the  New England Journal of Medicine) , position in the author list usually signifies the relative contribution of each author to the article, the first being the most important and the last being the least important. \r\n In both types of articles, there is always designated one author who is the corresponding author. In scientific papers, the corresponding author is almost always the last author; in medical papers it is usually the first author. The corresponding author is responsible for answering inquiries about the study and is generally considered to be the primary author for the paper. Look at the author list in the citations above. Thorsen's name is not first, nor is it last. \r\n Thorsen\u2019s position in the author lists of these two papers indicated that, whatever leadership position he may have held at Aarhus University and in its vaccine studies group, he clearly was not the primary contributor  for these studies . \r\n Furthermore, the papers were published in 2002 and 2003; presumably the research was done months or years earlier. \u00a0According to the US Office of the Inspector General, Thorsen's financial misdeeds took place between 2004 and 2010. \r\n Finally, there has been no hit of a whisper that these papers are even remotely at risk of being withdrawn. \r\n The claim: \u00a0 \r\n \r\n Dr. Wakefied's research never claimed vaccines cause Autism. His research showed that vaccines cause intestinal damage that led to leaky gut syndrome which allowed toxins to enter the bloodstream and brain, And THAT is what caused Autism. The doctor that supposedly debunked his research was funded by Merck, the manufacturer of the MMR and was related to Rupert Murdoch who obviously controls lots of the mainstream media.  This man was also convicted of embezzling CDC funds.  Over two dozen studies have since confirmed what Wakefields studies have shown. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fugitives/profiles.asp", "http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/347/19/1477", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/112/3/604", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-curious-case-of-poul-thorsen-fraud-and-embezzlement-and-the-danish-studies/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2014/02/is-it-true-that-the-one-doctor-who-debunked-wakefields-research-was-convicted-of-embezzling-cdc-fund.html", "title": "Is It True That The One Doctor Who Debunked Wakefield's Research Was Convicted of Embezzling CDC Funds?"},

This man was also convicted of embezzling CDC funds.  Over two dozen studies have since confirmed what Wakefields studies have shown. \r\n \r\n Note that the newest paper on this list is from 2009. Since then, there have been approximately 11,000 papers published on the subject of autism; \u00a0you would think that whoever has drawn up this list could find one or two to add to the list. \r\n (repost of my December 2013 post, for those who have difficulty clicking links) \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\r\n \u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n This putative list of 28 papers was originally published (to the best of my ability to ascertain) on Joe Mercola's site as a part of his interview with Andrew Wakefield in April, 2010. \u00a0The list has returned to circulation recently, so it deserves another look. \r\n Of the 28 papers, two (#18 and #22) are repeat citations, bringing the number down to 26. Wakefield's retracted Lancet paper was published on February 28, 1998. Any papers published prior to that date cannot be said to \"support\" or \"replicate\" his work. The list of 26 includes three papers (#5, #16, and #17) published well before the Lancet paper, so the list is down to 23. \r\n Of the remaining 23 papers, #s 2, 3, 4, 18, and 19 have Wakefield as a co-author. So we are down to 18 papers. \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n Of those 18 papers, #9 was published by a journal Wakefield edited; #20 \u00a0included Wakefield's co-authors on the retracted Lancet paper; and #27 is closely associated with Wakefield's Texas clinic, Thoughtful House None represent independent replication or support of Wakefield's research. \u00a0So the list is down to 15 papers. Remember what the retracted Lancet paper claimed,\u00a0 \r\n \" We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine.\" \r\n Of the remaining 15 papers, #s 1, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 24,25, 26, and 28 discussed some aspect of gut disfunction in autistic individuals but did not mention measles virus or measles vaccines. \u00a0These 10 papers do not, therefore, \"replicate\" or \"support\" the retracted Lancet paper or Walkfield's research. \u00a0the list is down to 5 papers. Of those 5 papers, #6 and 11 are by one researcher. \u00a0 \u00a0#14 is a speculative paper in a dodgy journal on the author's belief that autism is an occult tetanus infection. #15 discusses a treatment modality. #23 discusses metabolic variations in autistic adults.\u00a0 Paper #6 does mention autism and measles, but there is  sound reason to believe that what the authors found was laboratory contamination , not measles virus. \r\n In short, the list of 28 doesn't \"support Dr. Wakefield's Research\". \u00a0 \r\n The list as cited \r\n \r\n The Journal of Pediatrics November 1999; 135(5):559-63 \u00a0 gut; no measles \r\n The Journal of Pediatrics 2000; 138(3): 366-372\u00a0   Wakefield a co-author \r\n Journal of Clinical Immunology November 2003; 23(6): 504-517 \u00a0 Wakefield a co-author \r\n Journal of Neuroimmunology 2005\u00a0 Wakefield a co-author \r\n Brain, Behavior and Immunity 1993; 7: 97-103 \u00a0 published prior to February 1998 \r\n Pediatric Neurology 2003; 28(4): 1-3  Singh;\u00a0signficant doubts about laboratory findings;\u00a0 \r\n Neuropsychobiology 2005; 51:77-85 \u00a0 gut; no measles \r\n The Journal of Pediatrics May 2005;146(5):605-10 \u00a0 gut; no measles \r\n Autism Insights 2009; 1: 1-11  Published in journal edited by Wakefield \r\n Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology February 2009; 23(2): 95-98\u00a0 \u00a0 gut; no measles \r\n Annals of Clinical Psychiatry 2009:21(3): 148-161 \u00a0 Singh;\u00a0speculative paper \r\n Journal of Child Neurology June 29, 2009; 000:1-6\u00a0 \u00a0 gut; no measles \r\n Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders March 2009;39(3):405-13\u00a0 gut; no measles \r\n Medical Hypotheses August 1998; 51:133-144.

This study looked at 172 autistic children, who were classified (in a non-specific way) as having GI problems or not having GI problems. Only 23% had GI problems, mostly constipation and diarrhea. Those with GI problems were no different from subjects without GI problems in demographic characteristics, measures of adaptive functioning, or autism symptom severity. Compared to autistic children without GI problems, those with GI problems showed greater symptom severity on measures of irritability, anxiety, and social withdrawal. Those with GI problems were also less likely to respond to treatment. There is a glaring weakness in this study: one is that there was not a \"typically developing, but with matched GI problems\" wing, to see if the GI problems alone would account for the differences.

{"date": "Saturday, April 05, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Update: about 2 pm on Sunday, April 6, 2014, Chili's posted the following to their Facebook Page: \r\n \r\n \r\n Chili's is committed to giving back to the communities in which our guests live and work through local and national Give Back Events. While we remain committed to supporting the children and families affected by autism, we are canceling Monday's Give Back Event based on the feedback we heard from our guests. \r\n We believe autism awareness continues to be an important cause to our guests and team members, and we will find another way to support this worthy effort in the future with again our sole intention being to help families affected by autism. At Chili's, we want to make every guest feel special and we thank all of our loyal guests for your thoughtful questions and comments. \r\n \r\n Thanks, Chili's for thinking of autism for one of your Give-Back days. \u00a0Thanks also for supporting science and public health. \r\n \r\n On Monday, April 7, 2014, Chili's is planning to do a good thing, partnered with an inappropriate recipient. \r\n The good thing is that Chili's announced that they would be donating 10% of the day's receipts for each restaurant to a charity; in this case, an autism charity.\u00a0 ( As usual,  some restrictions apply:  in this case, you have to print out  this flyer  and present it to your server for the donation to be made.) \r\n The inappropriate recipent is the National Autism Association (NAA). \u00a0In turn, NAA has done some good work (on wandering and the Big Red Safety Box), but the the organization's overall mission and view of autism is unacceptable to me. \r\n Before I talk about NAA and why I don't support it, let's clear a little ground. \u00a0 First, Chili's is owned by  Brinker International ; locally, regionally, and nationally, the Brinker restaurants do a lot of this sort of fundraising: \"we'll give a percentage of the day's receipts to a charity\". I think this is great: it's a low-cost, low-stress way for a charity to raise funds, and it's a win for the participating restaurants by building traffic and ties to communities. \u00a0Well done, Brinker! Second, I want to acknowledge that it can be challenging for any enterprise (like Brinker) to select appropriate philanthropic partners. NAA sounds good and looks good and (as I have said) has done some good work. You'd have to be pretty sophisticated about autism or about the anti-vaccine movement to notice the details that I object to about NAA. \u00a0 Now, let's run the numbers.  First, Brinker: how much does any charity stand to garner from a one-day, \"bring a coupon or it doesn't count\" event like that planned for Monday? \u00a0I looked at  Brinker's 2012 annual report  (the last one available on the internet). \u00a0These are all back-of-the envelope calculations, mind you. \r\n In 2011, the average Chili's restaurant had a sales volume of $3,000,000.00 \r\n (3,000,000/365) = each restaurant's average daily take \r\n Let's just call that $8,200 per day. \u00a0The April 7 promotion promises to donate \"10% of your check\". \u00a0So each restaurant could conceivably donate $820 to NAA. \r\n In 2011, Chili's had\u00a01,279 US restaurants (Brinker owned and franchises).\u00a0 \r\n If every single patron at every single Chili's\u00a0 \r\n $820 * 1,279 = \u00a0$1,048,780 \r\n Of course, not every diner at every Chili's will use the flyer. \u00a0I have no idea what the rule of thumb is for such fundraisers. \u00a0 Each 0.01% change is approximately $105, so if say 2.5% of all patrons use the flyer, the take for NAA would be about $26,000, or about 5% of what they raised from all sources in 2011. Not bad for a no-effort fundraiser. \r\n NAA and why I don't support it. I go into some detail about \u00a0the\u00a0 National Autism Association Structure and Financials , but let me just say here: NAA promotes  uncontrolled and unethical experimentation  on autistic children; presents autism as a fearful thing and autistic children as \"damaged\" or \"less than\".\u00a0 \r\n Bottom Line for Chili's \r\n Thanks for thinking of autistic folks! \u00a0Hope this event doesn't happen, but maybe you can find some better autism organizations to support. \u00a0Here's a starter list: \r\n \r\n Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) --run by autistics for autistics\u00a0 http://autisticadvocacy.org/ \r\n Autism Women's Network (AWN) run by autistic women for autistic women \u00a0 http://autismwomensnetwork.org/ \r\n GRASP-- run by autistics for autistics \u00a0 http://grasp.org/ \r\n Autism Science Foundation (funds autism research)\u00a0 http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/ \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.chilis.com/Documents/NationalAutismAssociation.pdf?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1", "http://www.brinker.com/", "http://www.brinker.com/company/Brinker2012/annualreport2012.pdf", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-autism-biomed-movement-uncontrolled-and-unethical-experimentation-on-autistic-children/", "http://autisticadvocacy.org/", "http://autismwomensnetwork.org/", "http://grasp.org/", "http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2014/04/chilis-and-the-national-autism-association-why-i-wont-be-dining-at-chilis-on-april-7.html", "title": "Chili's and the National Autism Association: Why I Won't Be Dining at Chili's on April 7"},

As of Sunday, April 6, 2014, that event has been cancelled.  The data on NAA is still accurate. \r\n   What does the National Autism Association Do? \r\n The organization's  stated mission  is: \r\n \r\n The mission of the National Autism Association is to respond to the most urgent needs of the autism community, providing real help and hope so that all affected can reach their full potential. \r\n \r\n \r\n NAA offers funding for  biomedical  \" interventions \" for low-income families, through the  Helping Hand Program  (grants to families comprised 7.9% of NAA's income for 2009-2011). \r\n NAA provides families with safety/anti-wandering resources, through  Big Red Safety Box  (free safety toolkit)\u00a0\u00a0(grants to families comprised for the BRSB comprised 10.7% of NAA's budget 2011, the only year the BRSB was distributed). \r\n NAA used to provide support and counseling for parents whose marriage was affected by their child(ren)'s autism, through the  Family First program  (grants to families comprised 0.4% of NAA's budget for 2009-2011). \r\n NAA's new program offers communication software and devices, through Give A Voice (no grants yet made) \r\n NAA claims to be supporting translational autism research, through Progress Research (grants to univeristies accounted for 2.3% of\u00a0NAA's budget for 2009-2011). \r\n NAA hosts an annual \"National Autism Conference\" (The conferences accounted for 33% of NAA's income in 2009-2011 and 30% of expenses). \r\n NAA provides local support for families via regional chapters (no direct accounting of expenses or income).\u00a0 \r\n NAA directs families to Yahoo discussion groups (no effect on income or expense). \r\n \r\n From the IRS Form 990s published by the National Autism Association, I compiled a summary of the organizations financial activity for the fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011 (the last tax return available)  \r\n I cannot say I am hugely impressed with the percentage of funds supporting individuals, or the overall dollar amound given. \u00a0It bothers me that the organziation cannot seem to sustain projects such as Family First. \u00a0The \"Helping Hand\" fund seems to be designed to allow families with meagre means to spend money on \"biomedical interventions\", whhich some physicians refer to as \" uncontrolled and unethical experimentation on autistic children \".\u00a0 I am equally unimpressed with the portfolio of grants to organizations. I do not see sustained giving, and I see large grants to Thoughtful House (which has  since been reorganized ) and to BlackBaud (which sells fundraising software). I have never been to a National Autism Conference. \u00a0The l ineup of speakers for the 2009 conference read  like a \"Who's Who in Autism Is Vaccine Injury\" or anti-vaccination, pseudoscience purveyors: \r\n \r\n Andrew Wakefield \r\n Martha Herbert \r\n Dan Rossignol \r\n J eff Bradstreet \r\n Russell Blaylock \r\n Jerry Kartzinel \r\n David Kirby \r\n Barbara Loe Fisher \r\n \r\n In short, the National Autism Association is anti-vaccine to its core, and does very little to \"respond to the most urgent needs of the autism community\" or provide \"real help and hope\". \r\n NAA has a few chapters.

{"date": "Monday, April 07, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Updated April 12, 2014 \r\n Last week , The first week of April, 2014, the restaurant chain  Chili's  was promoting a Give-Back Day, promising 10% of receipts would go to an organization called the National Autism Association. On Sunday, Chili's cancelled the event. Here's the story. First,  Yay, Chili's!   This restaurant chain has a solid track record of supporting both regional and national philanthropic campaigns, through various  days or longer campaigns.  The most impressive of these is Chili's support for  St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital . \r\n Typically, the Chili's fundraising campaigns run like this:\u00a0: \"we'll give a percentage of the [duration of campaign] receipts to a charity\". I think this is great: it's a low-cost, low-stress way for a charity to raise funds, and it's a win for the participating restaurants by building traffic and ties to communities. (By the way, \u00a0Chili's is owned by\u00a0 Brinker International ; locally, regionally, and nationally, the Brinker restaurants do a lot of this sort of fundraising.  Well done, Brinker!) It's April, that is, Autism [Something] Month. [Something] could be Awareness, or  Acceptance , or even ... but I digress. At any rate, in April, lots of organizations and businesses and so on do autism-related events and fundraisers. And Chili's had a previous unplanned social media win, when the story about\u00a0A rianna Hill's distress over a \"broken\" cheeseburger, fixed by server Lauren Hills at a Midvale, Utah, went viral. \r\n Evidently earlier this month, somebody at Chili's had the bright idea to have one of their  Give Back days , at a national level (all 1,279 restaurants) with the proceeds to go to an autism charity. For some reason, Chili's selected the National Autism Association as the recipient. \u00a0I am not going to speculate about how or why the chain selected NAA, the fact is, it did. \u00a0What Chili's appeared not to grasp is NAA's belief is that some (if not all) autism is caused by vaccine injury, and can be ameliorated by pseudoscientific or downright dangerous treatments. \r\n On April 3, Paul Szoldra, writing at the Business Insider, broke the story:\u00a0 Chili's Is Fundraising For A Notoriously Anti-Vaccine Charity . Now, I don't think of the Business Insider as a notorious vaccine-activism publication.  Paul Szoldra  doesn't leap to mind as a public health advocate or an advocate for vaccines. \r\n \r\n Business Insider is dedicated to aggregating, reporting, and analyzing the top news stories across the web and delivering them to you at rapid-fire pace. \r\n \r\n Szoldra's story was surely the one that got the protest ball rolling. I first heard about Chili's planned donation Thurday April 3rd, through an email alert, but didn't really pay attention until I read Szoldra's story.\u00a0 \r\n Ken Riebel of  Autism News Beat interviewed Chili's public relations office on April 4 , who were apparently gobsmacked by the protests against NAA.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n \u201cRight now we are coming up with what we are going to say about it,\u201d a corporate spokesperson told AutismNewsBeat. She promised to call back when information becomes available. \r\n \r\n Michael Simpson at Skeptical Raptor detailed exactly how anti-vaccine and anti-science the NAA program is, at\u00a0 Don\u2019t unintentionally fund an antivaccination front organization . Chili's Facebook page erupted with thousands of comments, both pro and con. Sadly, I did not take a screenshot of the original post, which has since been deleted.\u00a0 On Facebook, Voices for Vaccines posted a call to action, and gave the Chili's corporate public relations office phone number:   \r\n Some of the twitter activism shared this photograph, using the hashtag #sideofmeasles. \r\n \r\n After hearing from people, Chili's posted the following on t heir Facebook page \u00a0early Friday morning: \r\n Text: \r\n \r\n At Chili\u2019s Grill & Bar, we\u2019re about making every guest feel special and pride ourselves in giving back to our communities. When choosing a charitable partner for our Give Back Events, both locally and nationally, we are committed to supporting organizations dedicated to helping children and their families. \r\n The intent of our 4/7 National Give Back Event is not to express a view on this matter, but rather to support the families affected by autism. Our choice to partner with the National Autism Association was based on the percentage of donations that would go directly to providing financial assistance to families and supporting programs that aid the development and safety of children with autism. We sincerely appreciate all of the feedback we've heard on this topic. \r\n \r\n The phrase, \"donations that would go directly to providing financial assistance to families and supporting programs that aid the development and safety of children with autism\" made me curious about NAA's financials, so I researched and wrote  National Autism Association Structure and Financials . tl;dr? NAA doesn't give much of its budget to providing \"financial assistance\" to families, and when it does, it's for unproven therapies. \r\n On April 5, Emily Willingham, writing at Forbes,  published a withering critique of NAA's \"science\" and closed with the following admonition: \r\n \r\n What [Chili's does] make abundantly clear with their choice\u2013and their doubling down\u2013is that being aware of autism doesn\u2019t help autistic people at all. And eating at Chili\u2019s on Monday won\u2019t help autistic people, either, although it looks like it\u2019ll help the NAA. And those are two very different outcomes. \r\n \r\n Late on Saturday afternoon, the Chili's Facebook page posted the following message,  as reported by Michael \u00a0 Simpson  (I again failed to get a screenshot, and the post has since been deleted):\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Chili\u2019s Grill & Bar Hi all- Thank you all for your thoughtful questions and feedback about Monday\u2019s Give Back Night. We want you to know all funds raised on 4/7 will go directly to support the Big Red Safety Box Program, which provides free toolkits to help autism families prevent and respond to wandering-related emergencies  http://nationalautismassociation.org/big-red-safety-box/. \r\n \r\n Mr. Simpson went on to discuss why that sop to advocates of public health is insufficient. \r\n \r\n The problem is that no one controls what\u2019s in that \u201ctoolkit\u201d, meaning it could still be carrying an outlandish antivaccination statement. Moreover, such a directed contribution means that the National Autism Association now has more money to spend on other efforts, like promoting the pseudoscience that vaccines cause autism. How is this a \u201ccompromise\u201d? How is this anything more than continuing support of an organization that actively promotes harm to children by providing information to the public that may reduce the the number of vaccinations, leading to more outbreaks of diseases that were once conquered in the USA. \r\n \r\n Robert T. Gonzalez,  at the influential io9 site , wrote,\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Chili's is, of course, free to donate its money wherever it damn well pleases \u2013 but you have a right to know where your money is going. And on April 7th, it'll be going to an organization that has no qualms drawing connections between vaccines and autism. \r\n \r\n Commentary at Facebook and on Twitter continued through Saturday. \u00a0 Mid-afternoon Sunday, April 6 2014, Chili's posted the  following to their Facebook page: \r\n Text: \r\n \r\n Chili's is committed to giving back to the communities in which our guests live and work through local and national Give Back Events. While we remain committed to supporting the children and families affected by autism, we are canceling Monday's Give Back Event based on the feedback we heard from our guests. \r\n We believe autism awareness continues to be an important cause to our guests and team members, and we will find another way to support this worthy effort in the future with again our sole intention being to help families affected by autism. At Chili's, we want to make every guest feel special and we thank all of our loyal guests for your thoughtful questions and comments. \r\n \r\n Note: As of 11:30 am Sunday April 6, there are 3,130 comments on the post above. \r\n Sunday afternoon, The National Autism Association published the  following to their Facebook page:   \r\n Text: \r\n \r\n Thank you to all of our supporters, and thank you to Chili's for taking a chance on us. Though NAA has changed our mission and efforts in recent years to focus on autism safety, namely wandering prevention, controversial views about vaccines remained on our website. Because of guest feedback about these views, Chili's has opted to cancel tomorrow's event. We respect their decision and ask everyone to please speak words of love and kindness. NAA has evolved as our children's needs have evolved. Our Big Red Safety Box Program very much helps protect children and adults with autism from wandering-related emergencies. We will continue to provide boxes as funding becomes available. Again, thank you for your support and your positive messages that represent our entire autism community. \u202a#\u200eLove\u202c \u202a#\u200eHope\u202c \u202a#\u200eNeverGiveUp\u202c \r\n \u25ba Please note: Chili's leadership team has made the difficult decision to cancel Monday's Give Back Event. Chili's remains committed to supporting the children and families affected by autism and so this decision was not made lightly. As you know, Chili's wants to make every Guest feel special and that includes listening to feedback from their Guests about this event. \r\n \r\n Monday morning, there were a number of articles published in the mainstream press, covering Chili's decision and giving Ms. Wendy Fournier, NAA's president, outlets to give her side of the story. \u00a0Ms. Fournier's protestations that NAA \"isn't anti-vaccine\" aren't very convincing, but that's a matter for another post. So what happened?   \r\n I don't think this had anything to do with autism. I suspect that there's a large swathe of the American community who is fed up with vaccine-refusing parents, pseudoscience, and the ensuing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease. \u00a0And they spoke. And Chili's listened. \r\n Sources before Chili's cancelled the Give  Back  event (I'll be adding to these silently) \r\n \r\n March 26 2013, Liz Klimas, The Blaze \u00a0 The Touching Story of a Restaurant Fixing a \"Broken\" Cheeseburger for an Autistic Girl .\u00a0 \r\n April 2, 2014 , Chili's press release\u00a0 How Fixing a \"Broken Cheeseburger\" Brought Chili's Compassion to Light\u00a0Viral act of kindness inspires nationwide Give Back Event benefitting the National Autism Association Monday, April 7 \r\n April 3, 2014, Paul Szoldra, The Business Insider,  Chili's Is Fundraising For A Notoriously Anti-Vaccine Charity . \r\n April 4, 2014\u00a0Michael Simpson, Skeptical Raptor,\u00a0 Don\u2019t unintentionally fund an antivaccination front organization \r\n April 5, 2014, Emily Willingham, Forbes\u00a0 Chili's Autism Awareness Problem \r\n April 5 2014 Marcy Franklin, The Braiser\u00a0 Chili\u2019s to Donate to Anti-Vaccine Crazies, Yikes \r\n April 5, 2014, Chelsea K The Grounded Parent  When Corporations Attempt Autism Awareness \r\n April 5, 2014,\u00a0Michael Simpson, The Skeptical Raptor\u00a0 Chili\u2019s stubbornly sticks with its support of an antivaccination group \r\n April 5, 2014, Michael Simpson, The Skeptical Raptor,\u00a0 Chili\u2019s kind of, sort of revises support for an antivaccination group \r\n April 5, 2014, Robert T.

He has written widely on anti-vaccination topics, as  discussed by Orac at Respectful Insolence .  Crosby primarily has been published at the anti-vaccine organ  Age of Autism . \r\n Science Mom \u00a0at  Just the Vax summarizes what happened this week very well : \r\n \r\n Last November (2012) there was a congressional hearing lead up by  California Republican representative Darrell Issa. \u00a0 Autism parent Brian Hooker  revealed a series of meetings  he had with rep. Issa and other congress critters.\u00a0 Mr. Hooker was accompanied by  Andrew Wakefield  who wined and dined members of the oversight committee that would ultimately hear testimonies from anti-vaccine groups on the topic of autism.\u00a0 The testimonies and speakers at this hearing has made  Jake Crosby very angry  and has posted his diatribe on none other than the Bolen Report*. \r\n The Cliff Notes version is that Jake has decided to slam his comrades-in-arms, particularly SafeMinds, because they chose to try and appear sane and rational (as sane and rational as one can be given that they believe vaccines cause autism) in front of the congressional committee by refusing to let Jake present his contorted conspiracy theories and instead letting Mark Blaxill speak and trimming Brian Hooker's screed down.\u00a0 Jake's little hissy fit is a thing of beauty to read as it illustrates the mindset of anti-vaxxers and their slimy tactics to weasel their way onto a platform of legitimacy. \r\n \r\n There is a history of folk scrubbing incriminating documents from the internet record.  I decided to take screenshots of Crosby's diatribe, posted below.  This of course removes the links, but preserves the sense. \r\nAs always, click to embiggen.\r\n( Image descriptions: a series of 13 screenshots of Crosby's post at The Bolen Report, SafeMinds Steals The Show, Literally... )\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n------- \r\n * If you are fortunate enough to be ignorant of who Tim Bolen is, or the barmpottery tthat is \u00a0the Bolen Report, you might want to read  Encyclopedia of American Loons, #31: Tim Bolen  or Quackwatch: A Response to Tim Bolen, or  A Nonsensical Attack on Stephen Barret . ______ \r\n \u00a0 \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/jake-crosby-once-again-unintentionally-convicts-himself-of-having-a-conflict-of-interest/", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/tag/jake-crosby/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/jake-crosby/", "http://justthevax.blogspot.com/2013/01/jake-crosby-throws-fellow-anti-vaxxers.html", "http://www.rollcall.com/members/3088.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2012/12/brian-hookers-testimony-autism.html", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/dec/23/struck-off-mmr-doctor-quackery-award", "http://www.bolenreport.com/feature_articles/Jake%20Crosby%20on%20SafeMinds.htm", "http://americanloons.blogspot.com/2010/06/31-tim-bolen.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/07/27/a-nonsensical-attack-stephen-barrett/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2013/01/a-disturbance-in-the-anti-vaccine-force-crosby-falls-out-with-redwood-safeminds-blaxill.html", "title": "A Disturbance in the Anti-Vaccine Force: Crosby publicly falls out with Redwood, Safeminds, Blaxill."},

{"date": "Tuesday, February 12, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t [ 2/12/2012:\u00a0edited to add: One of my readers suggested that I add the following disclosure, with which I agree. Mr. Crosby and my daughter are four days apart in age. \u00a0My daughter identifies as neurodiverse, as a well-remdiated dyslexic. \u00a0Her life experiences deeply inform how I veiw Mr. Crosby's writings.] \r\n In the 17 posts to Age of Autism in 2009, Jake Crosby broadens a number of themes and introduces a new element, the \"6,000 degrees of separation\" ploy to discredit those he disagrees with. \r\n Themes:  \r\n \r\n Autism  is too \u00a0caused by vaccines, specifically the ingredient thimerosal\u00a0 \r\n Any \"health authority\" who does not condemn vaccines is corrupt\u00a0 \r\n Autism is loathsome and should be prevented and/or cured \r\n The neurodiversity movement and the autistic-self-advocacy movement are despicable and should be condemned \r\n Any disagreement with the proceding statements  must  be caused by corruption or undue influence (usually wielded by the pharmaceutical / vaccine industry), which can be proven by association. \r\n \r\n List of Posts \r\n \r\n January 14, 2009\t Discovering I Was Toxic \t http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/01/discovering-i-was-toxic.html#more .  I found this to be the most poignant of Crosby's writings. In this post, Crosby recounts his belief that he was made autistic by a preservative formerly used in vaccines, thimerosal, and the \"treatments\" his mother subjected him to.  He also recounts his shame about being autistic, and expresses his anger at the \"health authorities\" who \"completely betrayed the public trust\" -- that is, Crosby's belief that vaccines are \"toxic\". \r\n \r\n February 19, 2009\t History Suggests HHS Candidate Not Unbiased on Thimerosal-Vaccine Issue \t  http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/history-suggests-hhs-candidate-not-unbiased-on-thimerosal-vaccine-issue.html . This post makes an unsourced, negative assertion about   Kathleen Sibelius 's position on vaccine safety:  \"As early as 2003, her staff has ignored warnings of thimerosal dangers, relying on federal and corporate information\".  \r\n \r\n March 3, 2009\t The Age of Neurodiversity   http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/03/the-age-of-neurodiversity.html .  In this post, Crosby is responding to a presentation on the Best Resources for Attainment and Intervention re Neurodiversity in Higher Education ( BRAIN-HE ),  Neurodiversity in higher education: Insights from qualitative research by the BRAINHE project.\" .  I am afraid Crosby misread, or mis-represented, the contents of the presentation.  Joseph (himself autistic) at Natural Variation goes into Crosby's errors in some detail at  AoA's Token Aspie Reacts to BRAINHE Study With Error-Filled Article , and goes on with  All Autistics Who Oppose Neurodiversity are High Functioning  and  Nevertheless, There Are Differences Between Autistics Who Approve of and Disapprove of Neurodiversity \r\n \r\n March 18, 2009\t A Glimpse Inside Asperger's Syndrome   http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/03/a-glimpse-inside-aspergers-syndrome.html .  Another poignant post, in which Crosby discusses how some of the executive functioning deficits intrinsic to autism hinder his  academic success.  But he robs the poignancy by setting up \"neurodiversity\" as a giant straw man in the closing paragraphs. Crosby seems to have isolated himself from autistic peers \u00a0-- he might have learned some tools and work-arounds for the problems he described. Here, some  other autistic college students comment on Crosby's attitude , and discuss some of the ways they have learned to compensate. \r\n May 8, 2009\t An Open Letter to Newsweek Magazine on Possible Neurodiversity Coverage \t http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/05/an-open-letter-to-newsweek-magazine-on-possible-neurodiversity-coverage.html \u00a0 Background: \"Sullivan\", writing at LeftBrain/RightBrain,  responded with: \u00a0\"... prior to the publication of the Newsweek article, Stephen Shore leaked the information.... Jake Crosby at the Age of Autism decided to blog his own misconceptions about it....\r\nMr. Crosby\u2019s blog piece had a fairly simple theme: \u201cdon\u2019t publish the Ari Ne\u2019eman article; interview me instead\u201d. Or, failing that, \u201cGive me equal time\u201d. We all knew (and I assume Mr. Crosby is intelligent enough to know as well) that his was an empty commentary: the article was already in press.\" \u00a0 (I highly recommend that you read the whole  LeftBrainRightBrain piece .) While Crosbydefines neurodiversity in such a way that he can deplore it, \u00a0this is another of Crosby's essays that I find poignant, particularly the depth of Crosby's dislike for how his mind works.\u00a0 \r\n June 6, 2009\t Newsweek\u2019s Newspeak: Pharma\u2019s Weapon Against Oprah \t http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/06/newsweeks-newspeak-pharmas-weapon-against-oprah.html .  This is an attack on Newsweek, the magazine itself.  The vehicle is the issue in which Newsweek takes issue with Oprah Winfrey's promotion of pseudoscience and outright quackery, which Crosby defends.  I came away with the feeling that the real issue was Crosby was miffed that Newsweek didn't give Crosby equal billing with Ne'eman.\r\n \r\n June 19, 2009\t Autism, Cancer and AIDS   http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/06/autism-cancer-and-aids.html .  This was a particularly ill-researched, ill-sourced, innuendo-riddled post, in which Mr. Crosby accuses Maurice Hilleman of \"importing AIDS\" , via monkeys Hilleman had imported from Africa for vaccine research. The facts behind the video Crosby cited was debunked (and the video called \"irresponsible\") in 2007,  by Brandon Keim at Wired .  Why would Crosby repeat such a false and baseless accusation? Because it gives Crosby a hook with which to slur another of the scientists that Crosby reviles, Paul Offit MD.  Turning from Offit, Crosby promotes the  OPV-AIDS hypothesis  as fact, even though that hypothesis had been soundly debunked and  refuted   five whole years  before Crosby posted this article.  The whole article is a smear attack on a deceased public health hero, Maurice Hilleman, and by extension, a living public health hero, Paul Offit.  Mr. Crosby wrote this at (what I believe, based on his graduation date)  the end of his sophomore year at Brandeis University.  The word \"sophomoric\" may apply.   \r\n \r\n July 13, 2009\t Autism, Asperger's: Who is Truly Disabled? \t http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/07/who-is-truly-disabled.html   This post was prompted by  Roger Kulp's letter to Age of Autism.    Mr. Kulp is an autistic adult with a complex, and incompletely treated, medical history.  In this post, Crosby elaborates one of his enduring themes: the argument against the neurodiversity  straw man .  In this post, it takes the form that neurodiversity advocates (NDs, in Crosby's usage) want to \"prevent people on the spectrum from getting help.\"  And yet -- this is another of Crosby's postings that I find poignant.  Remember, my daughter is almost exactly the same age as Crosby.   At the time he published the post, he wasn't yet 21, and didn't (at least in writing) appear to have folk --peers and adults--around him who were supportive.\r\n \r\n July 23, 2009\t Why Asperger Syndrome is a Legal Disability \t http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/07/why-asperger-syndrome-is-a-legal-disability.html  In this essay, Mr. Crosby is wrestling with the meaning of \"disability\" as it pertains to an \"invisible\" disability such as autism, especially for folk like himself who can \"pass\" as neurotypical.For me, it is another poignant post, in that Mr. Crosby seems not to have any broader connection to the disability-rights movement as a whole,or had never even been introduced to the  social model of disablity .  Read, for example, another autistic adult's response to this essay,  Cat in a Dog's World: Asperger's is a Disability  . \r\n \r\n August 8, 2009 \tJake Crosby Reviews Fox Searchlight's \"Adam\" Movie with Asperger's \t http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/08/jake-crosby-reviews-fox-searchlights-adam-movie-with-aspergers.html   Another, to me, poignant Crosby post, as he wrote: \"The movie \u201cAdam\u201d was billed as a romantic comedy, but to a person with Asperger Syndrome, it might be more of a suspense drama.\".  \r\n \r\n August 15, 2009\t First Michael Savage, then Denis Leary, now Rex Reed   http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/08/first-michael-savage-then-denis-leary-now-rex-reed.html . LeftBrain/RightBrain agreed, with links to other autistic bloggers' responses to Mr. Reed's hurtful, inaccurate words.  http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/08/19/rex-reed-is-just-plain-ignorant/ \r\n \r\n September 22, 2009\t\u201c Science\u201dBlogs: Seed Media\u2019s Aggressive WeedPart I: Fertilizer From Pharma  \t http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/09/scienceblogs-seed-medias-aggressive-weed.html .  This, and the subsequent of Crosby's posts, takes some scene-setting.   Seed Media's Science Blogs conglomerated a number of previously self-hosted science blogs.  The benefit to the individual bloggers was larger audiences; the benefit to Seed was revenue from embedded advertisements (sometimes embarrassingly inapposite).  Some of the bloggers wrote under their real names (cf PZ Myers); others used, for professional reasons, previously-established pseudonyms (cf Orac). Of those blogs that addressed immunization issues, all were deeply pro-vaccination, rejecting the failed theory that vaccines were somehow causal in autism.  If my memory serves correctly, Orac's  Respectful Insolence  was (and is) the most vocal of the pro-vaccination blogs. On April 2009, Orac published  The mindset of an antivaccinationist revealed, courtesy of Jake Crosby of The Age of Autism blog .  This seems to have been what prompted Crosby to dig into Seed Media.  In this essay, he attacks Adam Bly for being unqualified to run a science media empire  and  for monetizing science reporting; the Seed Media collective for rejecting the \"vaccines cause autism\" hypothesis, (\"the site full of bloggers who relentlessly defend mercury in vaccines and the MMR - even if it means defending sham studies, defending the CDC when it broke the law at Simpsonwood, destroyed data, lied, and did not disclose conflicts of interest \"), and Orac for...well, it's hard to say exactly, but mostly for having the temerity to reject Crosby's world view.   Along the way, Crosby begins to develop his theme of tenuous relationships among entities \"proving\" that the pharma industry controls what is written at the Science Blogging collective.\r\n \r\n September 23, 2009\t Part II Seed Media's \"Science\"Blogs: A 180 Degree Shift in Reporting   http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/09/part-ii-seed-medias-scienceblogs-a-180-degree-shift-in-reporting.html .  In this essay, Crosby presumes his previous essay had established that Seed Media and its science blogging collective are in fact, \"tied to the drug industry\".  He goes on to ask if Seed Media (the dead-tree magazine and the science blogging collective) had ever represented the \"vaccines cause autism\" issue in a way that Crosby would find acceptable. A short bit of clarification is needed for those new to the anti-vaccine, \"autism is vaccine injury\" ideology.  The notion that vaccines cause autism had its origins in the late 1990s, and achieved national prominence in the early 2000s.  The idea that thimerosal  might  have something to do with autism was a reasonable and testable hypothesis. One would expect a science magazine to report on this hypothesis in the early 2000s, and Seed Magazine did so, with an article   So research  was  done .  By 2001, or at,  by the latest , 2005 the evidence was clear: there is no reason to think that thimerosal exposure via vaccines is in any way causal in autism. Mr. Crosby, in this essay, advances the view that as of September 2009, the entire collective of science bloggers should still have had entertained the idea that somehow, vaccines are dangerous, specifically referring to autism. Because Seed Media Science bloggers instead regarded the issue as closed is evidence of \"censorship\" and that, somehow, Big Pharma controls the opinions and blogging output of all the contributors.  I will leave you to decide if Mr. Crosby's opinions are reasonable.

Autism Awareness Week Update: Current Schedule   http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/11/brandeis-u-autism-awareness-week-update-current-schedule.html  The finalized schedule. \r\n \r\n December 18, 2009  Keeping Autism Neurodiversity Out of the White House   http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/12/keeping-autism-neurodiversity-out-of-the-white-house.html .  This post starts out with a giant  strawman , Crosby's distortion of neurodiversity ( here  and  here  for more accurate representations, and keeps going.  What raised Mr. Crosby's ire? Ari Ne'eman's nomination to the  National Council on Disability  -- the first autistic so nominated. Crosby's article has a certain ring of sour grapes about it -- Ne'eman is a year younger than Crosby, but Ne'eman had by then achieved much more national prominence than Crosby,  mostly for Ne'eman's achievements in founding and leading the Autism Self-Advocacy Network and for  scholarly publications . Crosby stooped so low as to insinuate that Ne'eman's mother had political connections, which allowed her to engineer the nomination. In doing so, Crosby  misrepresented Mrs. Ne'eman's employment . Crosby closes by claiming Ne'eman is not representative of the autism community or adult autistics. Crosby implied that the \"real\" autism community endorsed the \"autism is vaccine injury\" claim, and denied and abhored Ne'eman's claim that  autistics are not inarticulate wretches crying out in hopes of a cure to return us to normalcy. We are human beings, individuals in our own right. We are who we are, not in spite of being autistic but in part because of it.\" . In other words, in Crosby's view, \"real\" autistics must be wretched sufferers, seeking a cure. An indication of how popular this view is among the autism community is that a  mere 782 people signed the online petition to oppose Ne'eman's nomination. \r\n December 22, 2009\t Autism Awareness Week at Brandeis: A Great Success! \t http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/12/autism-awareness-week-at-brandeis-a-great-success.html  The 2009 Autism Week committee did a remarkable job of putting together a multi-day, multi-speaker event.  While I disagree with many of Mr. Crosby's views, I was then impressed and remain impressed by what the committee accomplished.\r\n \r\n \r\n The Series \r\n \r\n Jacob Lawrence Crosby: A Catalog Raisonn\u00e9 (of sorts), 2008 - 2013 Part 1 Introduction and Early Life \r\n Jacob Lawrence Crosby: A Catalog Raisonn\u00e9 (of sorts), 2008 - 2013 Part 2 Works 2009 \r\n Jacob Lawrence Crosby: A Catalog Raisonne (of sorts), 2008 - 2013 Part 3 Works 2010 \r\n Jacob Lawrence Crosby: A Catalog Raisonne (of sorts), 2008 - 2013 Part 4 Works 2011 \r\n Jacob Lawrence Crosby: A Catalog Raisonne (of sorts), 2008 - 2013 Part 5 Works 2012 \r\n Jacob Lawrence Crosby: A Catalog Raisonne (of sorts), 2008 - 2013 Part 6 Works 2013 \r\n Jacob Lawrence Crosby: A Catalog Raisonne (of sorts), 2008 - 2013 Part 7 Appendices \r\n \r\n Autism and anti-vaccination events of note in 2008 and 2009 \r\n \r\n June 2008\u00a0 \" Green our vaccines\" march lead by Jenny McCarthy and her then-boyfriend, Jim Carrey.\u00a0 http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/jenny-mccarthy-jim-carrey-and-green-our-vaccines-anti-vaccine-not-pro-safe-vaccine/ \r\n May 26 2008, Ken Reibel is expelled from the AutismOne conference for being \"negative\".\u00a0 http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/62 \r\n September 18, 2008: Paul Offit publishes  Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure\u00a0 \r\n February 8, 2009 Brian Deer published \"MMR doctor fixed data on autism\"\u00a0 http://briandeer.com/solved/st-fixed-data.htm \r\n Stanford Medicine Magazine publishes a special issue on immunization\u00a0 http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2009spring/index.html \r\n May 22, 2009 Chicago Tribune publishes Trine Tsouderos and Patricia Callahan's multi-part story on quackery in autism treatment  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-autism-doctor-eisenstein-may22,0,3826791.story \r\n July 6, 2009: Andrew Wakefield gets crosswise with The Times of London\u00a0 http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/07/07/brian-deer-talks-back-to-andrew-wakefield/ \r\n July 7, 2009: Eric \u00a0London resigns from Autism  Speaks\u00a0http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/07/07/eric-london-resigns-from-autism-speaks/ \r\n July 15, 2009: FBI, IRS shuts down an autism clinic\u00a0 http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/07/16/fbi-and-irs-shut-quack-clinics/ \r\n July 29, 2009: Hazelhurst petition to the Autism Omnibus Proceedings denied\u00a0 http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/07/29/autism-omnibus-hazelhurst-appeal-denied/ \r\n August 11, 2009: Cedillo appeal to the Autism Omnibus Proceedings denied \u00a0http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/08/11/autism-omnibus-cedillo-appeal-denied/ \r\n August 12, 2009: Snyder appeal to the Autism Omnibus Proceedings denied\u00a0 http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/08/12/autism-omnibus-snyder-appeal-denied/ \r\n August 30, 2009: Matt Lauer produces an hour-long show, \"A Dose of Controversy\"\u00a0 http://insidedateline.nbcnews.com/_news/2009/08/25/4374204-sunday-aug-30-a-dose-of-controversy \r\n September 22, 2009: The National Health Services releases a report that indicate about 1 in 100 adults in the UK have autism.   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/6219201/One-in-100-adults-have-autism-research.html \r\n September 22, 2009: Autism Speaks Debuts the \"I Am Autism\" fundraising video.

From ASAN:\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n  The disability community is gathering in memory of disabled people murdered by family members or caregivers, and hosting vigils to honor the lives of those whom we have lost. \r\n We will be holding vigils in cities across the country, including Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington DC. For a full list of vigils with details on locations and times, click  here.   \r\n Join us Friday as we mourn for members of our community who were victims of murder. Our voices and the presence of our community are needed now more than ever. \r\n In solidarity, \r\n The Autistic Self Advocacy Network \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n ASAN Day of Mourning on March 1st February 4, 2013 Dear friends, Last year, the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, along with  Not Dead Yet  and the  National Council on Independent Living , held a Day of Mourning for people with disabilities killed by their relatives and caregivers. Day of Mourning began as a response to the murder of George Hodgins, a 22-year-old autistic man from California, and to the way people were talking about his death. Far too often, when a disabled person is murdered by a caregiver, journalists write as though it is the disabled victim who has perpetrated a crime simply by existing. In discussing the killing, people say that we should feel sorry for the murderer, because they had to live with a disabled relative. When a disabled person is murdered, many people act as though the murder victim\u2019s life, not their death, was a tragedy. On March 30th, 2012, we held vigils in 18 cities to remember those we have lost, and to remind the world that their lives had value. On March 31st, 2012, a 4-year-old autistic boy named Daniel Corby was drowned in a bathtub by his mother. There is so much work to be done to change public perceptions about the worth and the quality of our lives. That is why the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network will be holding Day of Mourning again this year on Friday, March 1st. And I need your help to organize vigils across the country. The first time I organized a vigil, I was very scared to do it, but it was not as hard as I feared. If you are interested in leading a vigil in your area, you begin by finding a good spot for it, making sure you can gather a group of people there, and spreading the word to your local community. If you want to organize a vigil, contact me at   zgross@autisticadvocacy.org  for instructions and support. I will help you find a location and to plan and publicize your event. On March 1st, we will remember our dead and take a stand against the violence facing our community. I hope to see you there.

{"date": "Tuesday, April 02, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t I'm not autistic. \u00a0I don't have close family members who are autistic. \u00a0But I support autistic folk -- both at a personal level, and at a broader level-- as much as I can. \u00a0Why? There are a lot of reasons. Here are three.  \r\n One: \u00a0autism  is  a natural variation in the human condition. Autism isn't \"new\" or \"increasing\" or \"a tsunami\". \u00a0 Two: While supports for autistic children are getting more common, adult autistic folk often lack the supports they need to live a full and satisfying life. \u00a0Three: Because a society that supports diversity of all kinds -- including neurodiversity -- is a better society than a more restrictive, limited society. \r\n The last few years, I've been rather pinched in how much I can financially support causes that I find worthy. \u00a0This year, at last, I can put my money where my mouth is. \u00a0The first thing I did was donate $365.00 to ASAN -- the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. \u00a0Why did I choose that amount? \u00a0Why did I choose ASAN? \u00a0 \r\n The number is easy: a mere dollar a day for a year. \u00a0 \r\n I chose ASAN because I support  its mission ,\u00a0 \r\n \r\n ASAN seeks to organize the community of Autistic adults and youth to have our voices heard in the national conversation about us. ASAN believes that the goal of autism advocacy should be  a world in which Autistic people enjoy the same access, rights, and opportunities as all other citizens.  We hope to empower Autistic people across the world to take control of our own lives and the future of our common community. Nothing About Us, Without Us!\u00a0 \r\n \r\n I would like to see the organization grow into a truly powerful organization, with mulitple chapters in every state. \u00a0 \r\n \r\n April is, in some quarters, \"Autism Awareness Month\". \u00a0My inbox is full of offers to \"show my support\" and partner with one particular, very large, national organization, which \u00a0has a \"Light It Up Blue\" campaign. \u00a0The campaign's goal is to raise money for the organization and to \"raise autism awareness\". \r\n I don't participate in those sorts of things, because I don't approve of the organization's goals and mission. \u00a0The Caffeinated Autistic summarizes the problems with the organization well at  this post . \r\n I started thinking about what the concept of the \"awareness month\" really meant. \u00a0 It implies that once the month is over, the job is done. \u00a0It implies that \"awareness\" is sufficient to meet the needs of the autism community. \u00a0 And it implies that one organization is meeting the needs of the autism community. \u00a0All three of those implications are false. \r\n \r\n Last year,  Paula Durbin-Westby  (an autistic and the parent of an autistic child) started something different:  Autism Acceptance . \r\n She is carrying on this year, with a  blog\u00a0 \u00a0and a Facebook  event page . \u00a0I urge you to go follow along. \r\n I believe that autism should be accepted, every day of the year. \u00a0I believe that autistics should dominate the conversation about autism, not not-autistic parents of autistic children, or researchers into autism, or any other non-autistic voice. \u00a0My donation to the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network is one way of acting on those beliefs. \u00a0There are other \u00a0autistic organizations to be supported as well. \u00a0Stay tuned throughout the month for news about those organizations. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/", "http://thecaffeinatedautistic.wordpress.com/so-what-is-the-problem-with-autism-speaks/", "http://paulacdurbinwestbyautisticblog.blogspot.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/events/307262445978535/", "http://autismacceptanceday.blogspot.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/events/314081628698619/?fref=ts"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2013/04/autism-support-and-understanding-every-day.html", "title": "Autism Support and Understanding, Every Day: 2013 Edition"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 08, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t For those of you who aren't conversant with issues in the autism community, elopement or wandering off can be a high safety risk for autistic people, especially children and those who do not have much expressive oral language, or who require one-to-one (1:1) supervision for their safety and well-being. \u00a0A 2012 study in Pediatrics  found that almost half of families had experienced an elopement episode. \u00a0( Note: the issue of wandering in autism is itself controversial in the autism community , which is beyond the scope of this post)\u00a0 \r\n In 2011, the National Autism Association (NAA) developed a kit to help families reduce the risk of elopement, The Big Red Safety Box,which they sent to families for no charge. (It was and is  available for sale .) \u00a0 \r\n Contents Of The Big Red Safety Box: \r\n According to  NAA's website, the box contains the following physical tools : \u00a0 \r\n \r\n Two  Door/Window Alarms with batteries\u00a0 \r\n One RoadID  Personalized, Engraved Shoe ID Tag* \r\n Five Laminated Adhesive Stop Sign Visual Prompts for doors and windows \r\n Two Safety Alert Window Clings for car or home windows\u00a0\u00a0  \r\n One Red Safety Alert Wristband\u00a0 \r\n \r\n \u00a0plus printed materials: \r\n \r\n A caregiver checklist \r\n A Family Wandering Emergency Plan \r\n A first-responder profile form \r\n A wandering-prevention brochure \r\n A sample IEP Letter \r\n A Student Profile Form \r\n \r\n note: a version of the the printed materials included in the box may be downloaded free of charge from\u00a0 http://nationalautismassociation.org/docs/BigRedSafetyToolkit.pdf \r\n Funding and Distribution for The Big Red Safety Box The program of distributing the Big Red Safety Box  began in 2011 , when NAA shipped 2,000 boxes free of charge. \u00a0The exact number of boxes shipped to date is not clear,  although as of April 4, 2012\u00a0 , NAA claimed to have shipped 10,000 boxes. \r\n The way the program appears to work is that NAA orders the contents of the box and has them shipped to an assembly plant, which appears to be a sheltered workshop for individuals with developmental disabilities. I believe NAA collects addresses for qualified recipients and ships the labels to the assembly plant for shipment (mailing or other delivery system). Anyone who has done this sort of thing knows that there's usually a minimum run -- let's say, in this case, 1,000 boxes. \u00a0 \r\n The cost per thousand appears from the 2011 NAA 990 to be about $25,000.00. \u00a0Autism Speaks, in an February\u00a0 2014 press release , \u00a0announced it had awarded\u00a0 \r\n \r\n \u00a0$30,000 in funding to the National Autism Association (NAA) to provide 1,000 Big Red Safety Boxes to families of individuals with autism. \r\n \r\n A  later press release raised  the amount to $50,000 for 1,500 boxes, or somewhere around $34,000 per thousand. \r\n However, as of April 8, 2014, this announcement was still up on the NAA website: \r\n \r\n Yesterday, in interviews about Chili's decision not to sponsor a national Give-Back Day for the National Autism Association, NAA President Wendy Fournier  was quoted as saying, \r\n \r\n \"This could have made a huge difference in how we could have served at-risk individuals in the autism community,\" Fournier said of the planned fundraiser. \r\n \r\n My Observations and Questions\u00a0 \r\n \r\n NAA's reported budget from 2009-2011  averaged over $500,000 per year .\u00a0 \r\n As far as I am aware, the Chili's fundraiser was  not \u00a0 the result of careful cultivation of Chili's by NAA's board or development staff, but a rather spur-of-the-moment initiative by Chili's national staff. \r\n If the Big Red Safety Box is so important to NAA's mission, why hasn't the NAA board worked more effectively to provide consistent funding?\u00a0 \r\n Has NAA undertaken any study to see if providing the box has had any positive effect? \r\n \r\n \u00a0 AWAARE \r\n NAA also lead the creation of the\u00a0Autism Wandering Awareness Alerts Response and Education (AWAARE) Collaboration, whose mission is to\u00a0prevent autism-related wandering incidents and deaths.

Authors' affiliations:  Shaw is a professor in the  Department of Ophthamology and Visual Science, specifically in the Graduate Program of Neuroscience, at the University of British Columbia.  Tomljenovic appears to be a post-doctoral fellow in Shaw's group. Interestingly, while Shaw references his interest in \"the potential for compounds such as aluminum to be neurotoxic,\" he does not list this or his other papers with Tomljenovic on his university biography page. \u00a0This paper lists the following sources of funding: \r\n \r\n The authors would like to thank Dr. James Garret tfor his invaluable help with statistical analysis. This work was supported by the Katlyn Fox and the Dwoskin Family Foundations.\u00a0 \r\n The  Katlyn Fox Foundation\u00a0 \u00a0is a Canadian charity that funds research finding vaccines dangerous. The Dwoskin Family Foundation funds a number of different projects, but has been quite generous to organizations that find vaccines to be dangerous. \r\n \r\n Claire Dwoskin is a board member of the anti-vaccine group National Vaccination Information Center.  Her husband, Albert, is president and CEO of A.J. Dwoskin & Associates, Inc. Through their foundation, they funded The Greater Good Movie, giving $25,000 to the project in 2010. Two years ago, they made two donations to the American Foundation for University of British Columbia, academic home to Shaw and Tomljenovic. One contribution, for $10,000, was just for \"general expenses\". The more significant donation was for lab costs for the \"Aluminum Toxicity Project\", for which they donated $125,000. \r\n \r\n Were the authors' findings influenced by their funding? Nature of Journal:  Reputable journal addressing among other things,  \"the role of metals in medicine \"; impact factor 3.197.\u00a0 \r\n   Where does this paper fit on the pyramid of evidence?\u00a0 \u00a0It appears to be a kind of cohort study.\u00a0 \r\n Methods:  The methods section of this paper reveals it to be fatally flawed. The methods are discussed at length in the posts below: \r\n \r\n http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2013/07/10/comment-on-do-aluminum-vaccine-adjuvants-contribute-to-the-rising-prevalence-of-autism/ \r\n http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/12/08/and-global-warming-is-caused-by-the-decr/  In particular, note:\r\n \r\n the authors are plotting ASD incidence in each year (1991-2008) against total aluminium content for the pediatric schedule *in that year*. Not (as you might expect) the aluminium exposure for the ASD cases themselves, according to the pediatric schedules of 6 to 21 years previously, but no, that same year. \r\n In effect they are looking for a correlation between the number of people who developed ASD decades earlier, and the number of vaccinations given to other children, in the current year. This is an interesting model of causality! \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n The World Health Organization's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety reviewed this study and another from the same researchers at their June 2012 meeting.  The report of that meeting read \r\n \r\n The GACVS reviewed 2 published papers alleging that aluminium in vaccines is associated with autism spectrum disorders and the evidence generated from quantitative risk assessment by a US FDA pharmacokinetic model of aluminium-containing vaccines. \r\n GACVS considers that these 2 studies are seriously flawed. The core argument made in these studies is based on ecological comparisons of aluminium content in vaccines and rates of autism spectrum disorders in several countries. In general, ecological studies cannot be used to assert a causal association because they do not link exposure to outcome in individuals, and only make correlations of exposure and outcomes on population averages. Therefore their value is primarily for hypothesis generation. However, there are additional concerns with those studies that limit any potential value for hypothesis generation. These include: incorrect assumptions about known associations of aluminium with neurological disease, uncertainty of the accuracy of the autism spectrum disorder prevalence rates in different countries, and accuracy of vaccination schedules and resulting calculations of aluminium doses in different countries. \r\n \r\n Summary: \r\n Remember that the compiler of this list of papers made the following assertion: \r\n Here we provide for the reader research that demonstrates the link between vaccines and autism, and the mechanisms by which vaccines can cause autism. \r\n Does this paper effectively demonstrate a link between vaccines and autism?  No. \r\n Does this paper demonstrate the mechanism(s) by which vaccines can cause autism?  No. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.donotlink.com/FW", "http://neuroscience.ubc.ca/people/Shaw", "http://katlynfoxfoundation.com/?page_id=2", "http://www.harpocratesspeaks.com/2013/08/a-snapshot-of-deep-pockets-of-anti.html", "http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-inorganic-biochemistry", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2013/07/10/comment-on-do-aluminum-vaccine-adjuvants-contribute-to-the-rising-prevalence-of-autism/", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/12/08/and-global-warming-is-caused-by-the-decr/", "http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/reports/Jun_2012/en/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2014/05/86-research-papers-allegedly-supporting-the-vaccine-autism-link-.html", "title": "86 Research Papers Allegedly Supporting the Vaccine-Autism Link: Paper #3, Do aluminum vaccine adjuvants contribute to the rising prevalence of autism?"},

Mr. Crosby and my daughter are four days apart in age. \u00a0My daughter identifies as neurodiverse, as a well-remdiated dyslexic. \u00a0Her life experiences deeply inform how I veiw Mr. Crosby's writings.] \r\n e\u00a0 Jacob Lawrence Crosby, hereafter Jake Crosby, is a 2007 high school graduate and a  2011 graduate of Brandeis University  with a bachelor of arts degree with two major subjects: History and Health: Science Society and Policy. Crosby matriculated in the  epidemiology track for Master's Degree in Public Health (MPH) at The George Washington University  in the fall of 2011.  \r\n Crosby is best known for his writings at the blog,  Age of Autism . His published works there began with personal accounts of his experiences with autism, specifically Asperger's Syndrome, and developed into accounts of his confrontations with vaccine advocates and criticisms of reporting on autism causation. \r\n Family, Early Life, and Education \r\nMr. Crosby was born December 2, 1988 ( source ) to Frederic G.\"Giff\" Crosby and Nicole Cranberg Crosby.  \r\n Mrs. Crosby's father was the highly respected research physicist, inventor, and entrepreneur,  Lawrence Cranberg, PhD . \r\n  Among Dr.Cranberg's  many accomplishments \u00a0was the invention of the    Texas FireFrame , which he built into a thriving business from its invention until his death in late 2012. \u00a0 The company is located in Austin, Texas. \u00a0His daughter Nicole Cranberg Crosby today  runs the company. \r\n Nicole Cranberg Crosby was brought up in Texas, and earned a BS in Advertising from the University of Texas. \u00a0She then relocated to New York, where   worked in advertising from 1978 to 1995 .  She was  named a senior vice president of Doyle Dane Bernback in 1986 .  In 2010, Mrs. Crosby  took over her father's fire grate business . \r\n \u00a0Nicole Cranberg Crosby's brother, Jake's uncle, is\u00a0 Alex Cranberg , a  highly successful energy industry entrepreneur . \u00a0He controls Aspect Energy LLC, and is a  controversial recent addition to the board of trustees of the University of Texas  (the alma mater for both himself and his sister Nicole). \r\n Jake Crosby's father, Giff Crosby, appears to have spent his entire career in the advertising industry. \u00a0According to his\u00a0 LinkedIn profile , Giff Crosby today works for\u00a0 Dentsu America . Previously he was a copywriter for such products as\u00a0 Miracle-Gro (2008) . \r\n In 1999, Giff Crosby\u00a0 was employed by DDB \u00a0(formerly Doyle Dane Bernbach), where he was an Executive Creative Director (ECD) slated to work on such firms as Compaq, Lockheed Martin, and The Bank of New York and new business. That same year,\u00a0 DDB picked up the vaccine maker Merck as a client. \r\n The industry giant\u00a0 Monsanto \u00a0brought RoundUP,\u00a0 a highly-toxic, carcinogenic weedkiller, to market. Doyle Dane Bernbach, which employed Mr. Crosby, provided advertising services to Monsanto. \r\n \u00a0What is known about Jake Crosby's life prior to 2008 is drawn from several of his published posts at Age of Autism. \r\n Crosby's first post for Age of Autism,  Living with Asperger's  in fact, may have been a sort of coming out, in which he proclaims to the world that he is an autistic student at Brandeis.\u00a0 \r\n In  Discovering I Was Toxic , Crosby discusses how he learned the belief that thimerosal in vaccinations may have caused his autism, and how he hid his autism, in shame, \u00a0from his classmates throughout high school and the first year of \u00a0college. \u00a0 \r\n \r\nWhile it\u2019s good to know the cause of my problems, as well as having the freedom to discuss them with others, what has been very disturbing was learning about the tremendous amount of suffering caused by the health authorities. They were given the huge responsibility of protecting people from defective drugs, but instead, completely betrayed the public trust. I am both overjoyed at the explanation I have for my condition and angered at the people who are responsible.\r\n \r\n These first posts also establish themes Crosby continues to develop: a deep loathing of autism; contempt for the neurodiversity movement and the allied, but not identical, autistic self-advocacy movement, and rage against the \"health authorities\" over a non-existent issue (the alleged toxicity of vaccines).   \r\n Next: Jacob Lawrence Crosby: A Catalog Raisonne (of sorts), 2008 - 2013 Part 2 Works 2009 \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/05/congratulations-jake-crosby-brandeis-graduate.html", "http://sphhs.gwu.edu/departments/epibio/programs.cfm", "http://www.ageofautism.com/jake-crosby/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/12/seth-mnookin-boots-jake-crosby-out-of-public-conference-chaired-by-merck-exec.html", "http://alexcranberg.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/my-dad-the-research-physicist-inventor-and-entrepreneur/", "http://lawrencecranberg.com/", "http://www.texasfireframe.com/", "http://www.zoominfo.com/#!search/profile/person?personId=1563751166&targetid=profile", "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/nicole-cranberg/2b/7a2/64", "http://www.nytimes.com/top/news/business/small_business/marketing_and_advertising/index.html?s=closest&field=per&match=exact&query=CRANBERG-CROSBY,%20NICOLE", "http://tf.newsblaze.com/story/2010120200065000038.tf/topstory.html", "http://alexcranberg.wordpress.com/", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2012/09/13/whos-the-texas-oilman-behind-the-newest-iraqi-gusher/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/us/12ttcranberg.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0", "http://www.linkedin.com/search/fpsearch?type=people&keywords=Giff+Crosby&pplSearchOrigin=GLHD&pageKey=nprofile_v2_view_fs", "http://www.dentsuamerica.com/", "http://www.splendad.com/people/show/3636-Giff-Crosby", "http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/ddb-grows-its-creative-ranks-42464", "http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/creative-deja-vu-ddb-25160", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate", "http://www.organicconsumers.org/monsanto/roundup.cfm", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/09/is-aspergers-sy.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/01/discovering-i-was-toxic.html#more"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2013/02/jacob-lawrence-crosby-a-catalog-raisonn%C3%A9-of-sorts-2008-2013-part-1-introduction-and-early-life.html", "title": "Jacob Lawrence Crosby: A Catalog Raisonn\u00e9 (of sorts), 2008 - 2013 Part 1 Introduction and Early Life"},

Jingjing Liu is also at MIT's  Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ; at the time of publication, she may have been working in Seneff's lab.\u00a0 Davidson is a physician practicing internal medicine. \u00a0His  license is current .\u00a0 The authors have an array of expertise unrelated to autism or to the etiology of autism. One would not expect an internist (Davidson) \u00a0to know very much about autism or about vaccinology. One would not expect a senior computer scientist (Seneff) whose area of expertise is\u00a0in computer conversational systems, (speech recognition, natural language parsing, discourse and dialogue modelling, language generation, and information summarization) to know anything at all about autism or autism etiology. The junior member of the team (Liu) has no research interests related to autism (spoken language systems, natural language processing, information retrieval).

The watchdog \u00a0Scholarly Open Access does not currently regard it as \" a predatory journal \" but there have been questions about the  academic standing of several papers published .  Some of the journals may be stronger than others. \u00a0 Entropy is not yet indexed in PubMed.\u00a0 \r\n   Where does this paper fit on the pyramid of evidence? \u00a0 It is a hybrid. The first half is a review of the literature that link various environmental exposures to autism. The second half is a sort of case series. \u00a0 \r\n Methods:  Both halves of the paper have fatal flaws. \r\n First, the review section. The authors do not appear to have a grasp of what autism is, or the concept of \"autism spectrum disorder\", or how the diagnostic criteria for autism have expanded over time. (If you are unclear yourself, see R.R. Grinker's  Diagnostic Criteria for Autism Through the Years  for disambiguation.) The paper's authors seem to believe that there is a monolithic \u00a0\"autism spectrum community\", composed entirely of parents of autistic children, all of whom believe that vaccinations caused their children's autism. In fact, the \"autism spectrum community\" consists of (1) autistic adults,  almost all of whom reject the autism-vaccine myth ; (2)  parents of autistic children  who  reject the autism-vaccine  myth; and (3) a tiny minority of the\u00a0parents of autistic children who embrace the\u00a0autism-vaccine myth.\u00a0 The review section is quite credulous in the sources cited, beginning with DeLong, moving through the Geiers, and includes a stop by Boyd Hayley. The review section is simply incompetent.\u00a0 \r\n The analysis section is worse.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n .... In this section, we will present the results of several experiments we conducted with the VAERS database, using standard statistical techniques based on word frequency information. \r\n \r\n What part about the following  disclaimer from VAERS did the authors not understand ? \r\n \r\n A report to VAERS generally does not prove that the identified vaccine(s) caused the adverse event described....VAERS data should be used with caution as numbers and conditions do not reflect data collected during follow-up. \u00a0Note that the inclusion of events in VAERS data does not infer causality. \r\n \r\n The analysis section is very hard to follow. \u00a0The authors \u00a0jump from from speculative autism causation theory A \u00a0to speculative autism causation theory Z\u00a0theory, even within the same paragraph. Many of the A-Z theories are mutually exclusive, a point which seems to escape the authors. Perhaps they were motivated by\u00a0\u00a0\"\u201cSpaghetti-Logic\u201d i.--throw every vaccine-autism link / theory against the wall to see if any of them would stick.

{"date": "Saturday, May 10, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t A Positive Association found between Autism Prevalence and Childhood Vaccination uptake across the U.S. Population  (Original Taylor number = 51, \u00a0second Taylor number \u00a0= 4, \u00a0current Taylor number = 6) \r\n Correct citation : Delong G., A positive association found between autism prevalence and childhood vaccination uptake across the U.S. population. J Toxicol Environ Health A. 2011;74(14):903-16. doi: 10.1080/15287394.2011.573736. \r\n Author affiliation:\u00a0  The author is not a medical researcher or an autism expert. She earned her PhD in Finance and International Business, and currently is an Associate Professor of Economics and Finance at the Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College, City University of New York. \u00a0At the time the paper was published, she was a member of the executive board of  SAFEMINDS , an acronym for Sensible Action For Ending Mercury Induced Neurological Disorders, an anti-vaccine group devoted to the discredited notion that a preservative in some vaccines was causal in autism. \u00a0Professor DeLong is no longer associated with SAFEMINDS at the board level. DeLong once described herself as \"a parent of two girls with autism. Starting in May 2005, her family began biomedical interventions to treat the girls\u2019 illness. Both girls have benefited greatly from supplements, diet, chelation, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.... She has attended rallies in Washington, DC to promote safer vaccines and spoken against adding vaccines to New Jersey\u2019s mandated schedule at a public hearing\" \r\n Nature of journal: \u00a0 Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A has an Impact Factor of 1.733, and a track record of  publishing highly questionable papers on the connection between vaccines and autism , including two papers by  the Geiers. \r\n   Where does this paper fit on the pyramid of evidence? \u00a0 This paper does not fit into the \"pyramid of evidence\" model.\u00a0 \r\n Methods:  There are many egregious flaws in this paper. To begin with, the introduction. DeLong misrepresents the scientific consensus on the possibility that receipt of vaccines is somehow connected to autism (the scientific consensus is that there is no connection). The sources she cites for this connection include the\u00a0 \r\n Then the use of educational data (The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)) as source data\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Under IDEA, every school is required to provide data on children who have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) , including the students\u2019 primary classification. As Liz Ditz pointed out, IDEA classifications are not medical diagnoses. A child with a diagnosis of autism under IDEA may or may not really have autism. Also, children with an IDEA classification of SLI are most commonly children with problems in fluency, articulation, or voice, not autism. Examples include apraxia and aphasias, voice disorders, stuttering, and language-based learning disabilities. \r\n \r\n It had been clear for more than 5 years before DeLong published her paper that  IDEA or educational data is unreliable as a source of autism prevalence. \u00a0That the author blithely used such data is a very serious condemnation of the paper. Then there is the issue of subsuming\u00a0Specific Language Impairment \u00a0(SLI) with Autism, as the author does in this paper. Dorothy Bishop is a professor at Oxford University; her whole career has been spent researching SLI.  While she agrees that there may be some overlap between SLI and autism,\u00a0 \r\n \r\n nobody would ever dream of treating them as interchangeable. It has never been suggested that SLI is caused by vaccination; it is highly heritable and typically involves very slow onset of language from the earliest stages. It is also considerably more common than autism. \r\n \r\n Another fatal flaw is that the author rests her argument on the  ecological fallacy: \r\n \r\n The ecological fallacy occurs when you make conclusions about individuals based only on analyses of group data. For instance, assume that you measured the math scores of a particular classroom and found that they had the highest average score in the district. Later (probably at the mall) you run into one of the kids from that class and you think to yourself \"she must be a math whiz.\" Aha! Fallacy! Just because she comes from the class with the highest average doesn't mean that she is automatically a high-scorer in math. She could be the lowest math scorer in a class that otherwise consists of math geniuses!\" \r\n \r\n Further commentary on this fatally flawed paper \r\n \r\n http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/07/08/a-positive-association-found-between-autism-prevalence-and-childhood-vaccination-uptake-across-the-u-s-population-2/ \r\n http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/06/11/speech-impairment-and-autism-inseparable/ \"The \"vaccination rate\" (they have a very odd definition) goes up dramatically in the first two years of the study. The \"autism+SLI rate\" does not. If there were a real association between the two, it would be clear in those first columns of data. \r\n http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/06/08/more-bad-science-in-the-service-of-the-discredited-idea/ \r\n http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2011/05/vaccines-cause-autism-until-you-look-at.html  \"My conclusion is that this dataset shows no evidence of any association.

One thing that I wish were more widely remembered is that  disabled people were among the first targets of the Nazis.  The rhetoric of the Nazi eugenics movement portrayed the disabled as \"burdens\" whose existence was an economic drain, a \"crisis\" that society couldn't afford. The Nazis borrowed this rhetoric from the early 20th Century eugenics movement in the U.S.A., and, once they'd had success using it to justify the mass murder of the disabled, they used variations of the same rhetoric to justify the mass murder of every other group they targeted. Remember this today, and remember it every time you hear anyone describe the lives of disabled people as \"burdens,\" or talk about any sort of disability in terms of societal \"crisis\" or how much it \"costs\u00a0non-disabled people.\" \r\n Bob Wright, co-founder of Autism Speaks, 2012: \r\n \"Autism is a global public health crisis.

Evidence was revealed at the Nuremberg Trials that German and Austrian physicians continued the euthanization of patients after October 1941, and that a total of about 275,000 people were murdered under T4.

{"date": "Saturday, February 01, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t The short version: scant evidence for \"leaky gut syndrome\" at all; \u00a0none for it being caused by vaccines; none for it being a defining or causal characteristic in autism. Let's start with some definitions. \u00a0\"Leaky gut\", formally, \u00a0is \"intestinal permeability\", \u00a0and increased intestinal permeability really does exist in some conditions.\u00a0 \r\n The general \"leaky gut syndrome\" storyline runs like this: a typically-developing child is vaccinated; the child develops \"leaky gut\", which allows particles from food (especially gluten and casein) leak into the blood and affect the brain. Child's behavior changes. In a previous post, we reviewed the  evidence that vaccines do not affect the intestine s.\u00a0 \r\n Leaky gut syndrome is almost certainly a  \"fad diagnosis\" , without a medical basis.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n ...\"leaky gut syndrome,\" is described by proponents as a condition in which the intestinal lining becomes irritated and porous so that unwanted food particles, \"toxins,\" bacteria, parasites, and \"Candida\" enter the bloodstream and result in \"a weakened immune system, digestive disorders, and eventually chronic and autoimmune disease.\" Treatment of this alleged condition can include dietary changes (such as not eating protein and starch at the same meal); \"cleansing\" with herbal products; \"reestablishing good balance\" of intestinal bacteria; and supplement concoctions claimed to strengthen and repair the intestinal lining. Note: Some medical scientists use the term \"leaky gut\" for problems associated with abnormal intestinal permeabilty, but \"leaky gut syndrome\" is not one of them. \r\n \r\n The origins of the \"leaky gut\" myth start with\u00a0 Jaak Panksepp , who published \u00a0\"A neurochemical theory of autism\" in 1979. In that paper, Panksepp proposed that autism arises from an upset in the opiate systems in the brain. \u00a0\u00a0Then in 1991, Karl Ernst (Kalle) Reichelt published a paper in Norwegian on leaky gut, and later published other papers in English. \u00a0Since then, the idea that certain foodstuffs (and/or vaccination) cause a host of symptoms and problems have passed into \"common knowledge\", without the benefit having a base of evidence. \u00a0 \r\n The UK's National Health System has this to say about  \"Leaky gut syndrome\" \r\n \r\n 'Leaky gut syndrome' is a proposed condition some health practitioners claim is the cause of a wide range of long-term conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple sclerosis. \r\n Proponents of 'leaky gut syndrome' claim that many symptoms and diseases are caused by the immune system reacting to germs, toxins or other large molecules that have been absorbed into the bloodstream via a porous ('leaky') bowel. \r\n There is little evidence to support this theory, and no evidence that so-called 'treatments' for 'leaky gut syndrome', such as nutritional supplements and a gluten-free diet, have any beneficial effect for most of the conditions they are claimed to help. \r\n While it is true that certain factors can make the bowel more permeable, this probably does not lead to anything more than temporary mild inflammation of an area of the bowel. \r\n \r\n \r\n Why we should be sceptical about 'leaky gut syndrome' \r\n Unproven theory \r\n Exponents of 'leaky gut syndrome' \u2013 largely nutritionists and practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine \u2013 believe the bowel lining can become irritated and 'leaky' as the result of a much wider range of factors, including an overgrowth of yeast or bacteria in the bowel, a poor diet and the overuse of antibiotics. \r\n They believe that undigested food particles, bacterial toxins and germs can pass through the 'leaky' gut wall and into the bloodstream, triggering the immune system and causing persistent inflammation throughout the body. This, they say, is linked to a much wider range of health problems and diseases, including: \r\n The above theory is vague and currently largely unproven. \r\n \r\n There \u00a0has been one small pilot study on the leaky gut hypothesis in autism. \r\n \r\n Robertson MA, Sigalet DL, Holst JJ, Meddings JB, Wood J, Sharkey KA.\u00a0 Intestinal permeability and glucagon-like peptide-2 in children with autism: a controlled pilot study .\u00a0J Autism Dev Disord. 2008 Jul;38(6):1066-71. doi: 10.1007/s10803-007-0482-1. Epub 2008 Feb 29. Abstract We measured small intestinal permeability using a lactulose:mannitol sugar permeability test in a group of children with autism, with current or previous gastrointestinal complaints. Secondly, we examined whether children with autism had an abnormal glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) response to feeding. Results were compared with sibling controls and children without developmental disabilities. We enrolled 14 children with autism, 7 developmentally normal siblings of these children and 8 healthy, developmentally normal, unrelated children.  Our study did not detect differences in these measures of gastrointestinal function in a group of children with autism. \r\n \r\n \u00a0 Edited \u00a0to add: \r\n Thjodleifsson B, Dav\u00eddsd\u00f3ttir K, Agnarsson U, Sigth\u00f3rsson G, Kjeld M, Bjarnason I.

Virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue.\u201d \r\n \r\n but Wakefield loudly proclaimed at the 1998 press conference, and ever since, that the MMR was linked to autism:` \r\n Jeremy Laurance, a UK reporter,  was at the press conference and published this report in 2010 \r\n \r\n [The Royal Free Hospital] \u00a0decided to deal with the inevitable press interest head on. It called a press conference before a panel of five doctors, led by Professor Arie Zuckerman (a virologist and dean of the medical school, but not an author of the paper), who were carefully selected to present a balanced view. All were eminent in their own fields but, fatally, each had a different opinion. \r\n The five had rehearsed the press conference in advance and agreed the line they would take, which was to recommend continued use of the MMR vaccine pending further research. Under questioning, however, this carefully constructed consensus fell apart. \r\n The five of them were sitting behind a table with Andrew Wakefield on the extreme left and Arie Zuckerman on the right. The tension rose as the event progressed and by the end Wakefield was coolly urging parents to give their children single vaccines at annual intervals, while Zuckerman was on his feet, banging the lectern in frustration as he insisted that the MMR vaccine had been given to millions of children around the world and was safe. \r\n \r\n Brian Deer has a  transcript of the interview Wakefield gave to Twenty Twenty Television on February 4 1998 \r\n DR ANDREW WAKEFIELD: ... And I have to say that there is sufficient anxiety in my own mind of the safety, the long term safety of the polyvalent, that is the MMR vaccination in combination, that I think that it should be suspended in favour of the single vaccines, that is continued use of the individual measles, mumps and rubella components...there is no doubt that if you give three viruses together, three live viruses, then you potentially increase the risk of an adverse event occurring, particularly when one of those viruses influences the immune system in the way that measles does. And it may be, and studies will show this or not, that giving the measles on its own reduces the risk of this particular syndrome developing... the risk of this particular syndrome developing is related to the combined vaccine, the MMR, rather than the single vaccines.... People have been saying for some time, people on the periphery of autism, have been saying for some time that this may well be related to bowel damage. The Italians for example have found that children who are autistic have in many cases a leaky intestine. Others, biochemists, have been saying that it may be a toxic state that absorption of chemicals such as opioid, peptides, morphine like substances from the gut that you and I produce in our diet from milk and wheat, are actually getting access through that leaky gut into the developing brain. \r\n On May 8, 2012, the blog Left Brain/Right Brain published a list, \" Andrew Wakefield\u2019s many statements that MMR causes autism \".

{"date": "Saturday, February 01, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t The short answer is no. And no, vaccinations of any kind do not cause autism. This is part of the whole myth about \"leaky gut\". \r\n First, the evidence, then the myth. \r\n At present, there are no biologically-based tests that can diagnose autism.  \u00a0Not blood tests, not screening tests using biological markers. \u00a0Nothing. \u00a0 Can autism be detected by testing for \"toxins\" in the blood? (And by implication, in the brain?) No. \u00a0The folk that so proclaim have no evidentiary basis. \u00a0There are labs that claim to test for autism and other conditions from blood samples and other biological samples. Even Fox News ( Fox News! ) have  condemned them. \r\n The myth runs something like this: \r\n \r\n A typically-developing child is vaccinated; the child develops \"leaky gut\", which allows particles (petides) \u00a0from food, especially gluten and casein, to leak into the blood. These peptides can cross the blood-brain barrier, because they are similar in structure to natural opioids, so they are a match for structures in the opioid receptors in the brain. \u00a0Thus, these peptides\u00a0cause the problems with speech, social skills and behavior that are the hallmarks of autism. \u00a0If you remove the sources (gluten and casein) from an autistic child's diet, plus adding other treatments, the autism can be reversed.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n The most famous person advocating this myth is Jenny McCarthy, who said in a 2007 interview promoting her book: \r\n You know, I could in two months turn Evan completely autistic again. I could do it completely through diet. And maybe getting some vaccine boosters. Through diet, I could load him up again with all the things that will aggravate the damage that was done. Right now, what happened now was that I healed him to the point where he got everything back to this baseline level and it stays there like this. But I mess with it at all\u2013boom! \r\n No. Just no \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/autism/detail_autism.htm#243533082", "http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fox_News", "http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/04/06/quack-attack-case-dangerous-sippy-cup/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2014/02/is-it-true-that-autistic-folk-have-toxins-in-their-bloodstreams-and-their-brains.html", "title": "Is it True that Autistic Folk Have Toxins In Their Bloodstreams And Their Brains?"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 01, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t The short answer is no and no. \u00a0No vaccine-strain virus persistent in the gut; and no unique intestinal damage in autism.\u00a0 The longer answer: In addition to the retracted 1998 paper, Wakefield was a co-author on a 2002 paper. which has  not\u00a0 been retracted, but whose findings have been shown to be not valid. \r\n The paper is: Uhlmann V, Martin CM, Sheils O, Pilkington L, Silva I, Killalea A, Murch SB, Walker-Smith J, Thomson M, Wakefield AJ, O'Leary JJ.  Potential viral pathogenic mechanism for new variant inflammatory bowel disease . Mol Pathol. 2002 Apr;55(2):84-90. \r\n Astonishingly, the paper and an accompanying editorial were the subject of a BBC World News episode of Panaroma on\u00a0Sunday February 3 2002, \" MMR: Every Parent's Choice\" \u00a0(the link is to a transcript of the show).\u00a0 \r\n How about the Uhlmann paper? \u00a0Is it true that there is evidence of damage to some children's \u00a0intestinal tracts from vaccines, specifically the measles vaccine? \u00a0To say that it is true, two things would have to be true: evidence of damage, and evidence of vaccine-strain measles virus (VSMV) in the damaged areas.\u00a0 I will discuss the second issue first. \u00a0Was there ever evidence of \"vaccine-strain measles virus (VSMV) in the damaged areas\"? \u00a0The answer is almost certainly no. \u00a0Stephen Bustin, who is arguably the world's expert on the technique used to find viral particles in tissue, says no. \u00a0The technique is\u00a0polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Professor Bustin has published several articles on the shortcomings of the Wakefield research group (including Uhlmann): \r\n \r\n RT-qPCR and molecular diagnostics: no evidence for measles virus in the GI tract of autistic children  (2008) \r\n Why There Is no Link Between Measles Virus and Autism  (2013) \r\n \r\n In 2008, Hornig et al. set out to replicate Wakefield and Uhlmann's finding, in: \r\n Hornig M, Briese T, Buie T, Bauman ML, Lauwers G, Siemetzki U, Hummel K, Rota PA, Bellini WJ, O'Leary JJ, Sheils O, Alden E, Pickering L, Lipkin WI.  Lack of association between measles virus vaccine and autism with enteropathy: a case-control study . PLoS One. 2008 Sep 4;3(9):e3140. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0003140. \r\n \r\n This study provides strong evidence against association of autism with persistent MV RNA in the GI tract or MMR exposure. Autism with GI disturbances is associated with elevated rates of regression in language or other skills and may represent an endophenotype distinct from other ASD. \r\n \r\n These are just a few of many papers that show that children with autism\u00a0 do not  have vaccine-strain measles virus in their GI systems or circulating in their blood.\u00a0 \r\n Turning back to the first issue: do autistic people have changes in the histology of their gastrointestinal tracts that is unique to autism ? (Histology = \"the study of the microscopic structure of tissues.\") \r\n In 2007, \u00a0a literature review was published (emphasis added) \r\n \r\n MacDonald TT, Domizio P.  Autistic enterocolitis; is it a histopathological entity?  Histopathology. 2007 Feb;50(3):371-9; discussion 380-4. \r\n AIMS:  To review the literature on the histopathological diagnosis of the condition termed 'autistic enterocolitis'. \r\n METHODS AND RESULTS:  We have reviewed all published works where mucosal biopsy specimens from autistic children have been examined histopathologically. Abstracts were excluded. Our review of the published works,  nearly all from a single centre , identifies major inconsistencies between studies, lack of appropriate controls and misinterpretation of normal findings as pathology. Ileal lymphoid hyperplasia may be more prevalent in children with regressive autism but is also seen in children with food allergies and severe constipation,  the latter being an extremely common finding in autistic children \r\n CONCLUSION:The histopathological diagnosis of autistic enterocolitis should be treated with caution until a proper study with appropriate methodology and controls is undertaken. \r\n \r\n What about the children in Wakefield's retracted 1998 paper? As Brian Deer reported in the  British Medical Journal (April 2010) , the 12 children in the 1998 paper really had histological profiles within the normal range.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n With swollen glands in the terminal ileum (widely regarded as a benign or normal finding in children), this \u201ccolitis\u201d\u2014which was even cited in the retracted paper\u2019s title\u2014was Wakefield\u2019s new disease. And yet the colitis was apparently invisible to the Royal Free\u2019s pathology service. \r\n In fact the service identified findings suggestive of possible inflammatory bowel disease in only one of the 12 children. \u201cThe mild patchy generalised increase in inflammatory cells with lymphoid aggregates and follicles is not very specific but could be in keeping with low grade quiescent inflammatory bowel disease,\u201d it reported for child 2. But this inflammation resolved after two months\u2019 enteral feeding with a product now marketed as Modulen. A repeat ileocolonoscopy found no abnormality, and a food intolerance was diagnosed. \r\n \r\n In short, autistic folk  do not  have changes in the histology of their gastrointestinal tracts that is unique to autism, nor are there GI changes caused by vaccination against measles, or any other immunization.\u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n Brian Deer's Investigative Reporting on the MMR Scare and Wakefield's Conduct \r\n \r\n The Lancet Scandal (Times of London Sunday Edition 2004) \r\n MMR: What They Didn't Tell You (BBC Channel 4 Documentary, 2004) \r\n Solved--The Riddle of MMR (Times of London Sunday Edition 2009) \r\n Wakefield's 'Autistic Enterocolitis' Under the Microscope (British Medical Journal April 2010) \r\n Secrets of the MMR Scare (British Medical Journal, January 2011) \r\n Pathology reports solve \"new bowel disease\" riddle (British Medical Journal, November 2011) \r\n \r\n Additional Commentary on Horning paper: \r\n \r\n MMR still doesn\u2019t cause autism \r\n New MMR study makes the NAA angry \r\n The final nail in the coffin of the MMR vaccine-autism hypothesis \r\n MMR and Autism \u2013 No connection \r\n Lack of Association between Measles Virus Vaccine and Autism \r\n Experts comment on Hornig et al.\u2019s MMR paper \r\n The exoneration of John O\u2019Leary \r\n U.S. study clears measles vaccine of autism link \r\n Vaccination doesn\u2019t cause autism volume what-are-we-up-to-now? \r\n NOW is it over? \r\n Before the MMR science, the press conference \r\n MMR Vaccine Does Not Cause Autism (not that you didn\u2019t know that already) \r\n Antivax: new evidence shows (again) no link to autism \r\n New study finds no vaccine-autism link \r\n Yet another really bad day for antivaccinationists: No link between MMR and autism\u2013again \r\n Study Says No MMR-Autism Link; NAA Says \u201cFlawed\u201d \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11950955", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/audio_video/programmes/panorama/transcripts/transcript_03_02_02.txt", "http://www.badscience.net/wp-content/uploads/erp_mmr.pdf", "http://www.intechopen.com/books/recent-advances-in-autism-spectrum-disorders-volume-i/why-there-is-no-link-between-measles-virus-and-autism", "http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0003140", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17257133", "http://briandeer.com/solved/bmj-pathology.pdf", "http://briandeer.com/mmr-lancet.htm", "http://briandeer.com/wakefield-deer.htm", "http://briandeer.com/solved/solved.htm", "http://briandeer.com/solved/bmj-enterocolitis.htm", "http://briandeer.com/solved/bmj-secrets-series.htm", "Pathology%20reports solve \"new bowel disease\" riddl", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1252", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1262", "http://www.blacktriangle.org/blog/?p=1833", "http://actionforautism.co.uk/2008/09/04/mmr-and-autism-no-connection/", "http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=372", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1301", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1291", "http://www.forbes.com/reuters/feeds/reuters/2008/09/03/2008-09-03T213128Z_01_N03276037_RTRIDST_0_AUTISM-MMR-EMBARGOED.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2008/09/oh_lets_go_back_to.php", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/09/now-is-it-over.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1285", "http://www.autismvox.com/mmr-vaccine-does-not-cause-autism-not-that-you-didnt-know-that-already/", "http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/09/03/antivax-new-evidence-shows-again-no-link-to-autism/", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-measles_thusep04,0,5169721.story", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/09/yet_another_really_bad_day_for_antivacci_1.php", "http://www.autismvox.com/study-says-no-mmr-autism-link-naa-says-flawed"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2014/01/is-it-true-that-andrew-wakefields-research-showed-that-vaccines-cause-intestinal-damage.html", "title": "Is It True that Andrew Wakefield's Research Showed that Vaccines Cause Intestinal Damage?"},

{"date": "Saturday, April 16, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Before I begin:\u00a0Autism is a natural variation in being human. Vaccines don't cause autism.  In advocating for vaccines, I refuse to stigmatize autistic people . There's no \"debate\". On the one hand, there's the overwhelming weight of the scientific evidence: vaccines are not causal in autism. On the other hand, there are people who passionately believe that vaccines cause autism. These beliefs, while heartfelt, are mistaken. This erroneous belief that vaccines cause autism causes harm to autistic people in several ways. One is that the focus on vaccine causation has diverted attention away from the real needs of autistic people. Another is that the vaccine myth has lead parents to subject their children to harmful and useless \"cures\" such as bleach enemas, long courses of unneeded medications, and/or restrictive diets.\u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n This is a sad state of affairs. The false notions that vaccines are unsafe and may be causal in autism are back in the news.\u00a0 \r\n What happened: a film stigmatizing and exploiting autistic people and blaming autism on vaccines, Vaxxed, was slated to appear at the Tribeca Film Festival, at the behest of Robert De Niro's wife, Grace Hightower. After many people objected, Vaxxed was withdrawn and opened at a New York theater. \u00a0The withdrawal brouhaha\u00a0attracted  a lot of media attention.\u00a0 \r\n \u00a0On Wednesday, April 13, Robert De Niro and\u00a0Jane Rosenthal appeared on The Today Show\u00a0to celebrate the 15th opening of the Tribeca Film Festival. The conversation turned to the Vaxxed ruckus, and  De Niro said ,\u00a0 \r\n \"I, as a parent of a child who has autism, am concerned, and I want to know the truth,\" he said. \"I'm not anti-vaccine. I want safe vaccines. Some people can't get a certain type of shot and they can die from it \u2014 even penicillin. \u2026 If you're scientists, let's see, let's hear. Everybody doesn't seem to want to hear much about it. It's shut down, and you guys [the media] are the ones that should be investigating it.\" \r\n Articles Explaining That Vaccines Are Safe, and The Role of Vaccines in Autism Has Already Been Investigated, Intensively \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016 Manny Alvarez MD at Fox News  Dr. Manny: I'm talkin' to you, De Niro -- autism is not caused by vaccines \r\n \r\n When it comes to health, false promises and misinformed theories lead to inefficient therapies and dead end research. At the end of the day, it leads to anger and the misperception that somebody \u201ccaused\u201d whatever medical hardship you\u2019re facing to happen to you, and that is not a good starting point when it comes to autism. After 25 years of watching the rates of autism increase, we are faced with two challenges in this field. One: we must do more for these young adults entering the real world. We need more education, more job opportunities, better government support and full integration into society. Two: we must support genuine autism research. We must find out where autism originates, which could possibly begin in the womb. \r\n Creating an environment of suspicion only delays what we must accomplish today. De Niro, I need you and your celebrity pals to concentrate on today. I know that you chose a different career path than I, and that it takes many years of scientific training to understand cellular biology, but that is not an excuse to give any form of validity to Wakefield\u2019s quack claims. Rather than acting as a mouthpiece for conspiracy theorists and the like, it\u2019s time for you to use your celebrity power for good and help me, a father like you, get the answers we want. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016, Russell Saunders MD at The Daily Beast  Robert De Niro Sticks Up for Anti-Vaxx Documentary \r\n \r\n I would happily sit down with De Niro, pause Vaxxed at any moment of his choosing, and rebut every single point he cares to mention.... And there is  a perfectly good, accurate movie about vaccines  for people who want to watch one. \r\n But it is lamentable that once again a celebrity has cast in his lot with people willing to ignore, deny, or even misrepresent medical science. De Niro\u2019s comments not only shake his credibility as an arbiter of quality documentary films, they have the potential to make our country less safe from disease. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016 Rupal Pinto, MD, FAAP at Doc2mom  The story they don\u2019t want you to hear \r\n There\u2019s nothing like a new celebrity wagging his finger at the medical establishment to make a doctor-mom want to vomit. A lot. The most recent iteration: Dr. (okay, not a doctor) Robert DeNiro stating that physicians and researchers have not been paying sufficient attention to the conversation about whether vaccines are related to autism (Antique Spoiler alert: they\u2019re not.) Doctors deal with this issue every day \u2013 thanks to the work of charlatans like Andrew Wakefield \u2013 and millions of dollars have been spent trying to see if there is a relationship. No relationship has been found. Mr. DeNiro says that \u201cnobody wants to talk about it.\u201d Not true. We talk about it often with patients and we all do our reading and our homework and I have personally read that horrific Wakefield study enough times to know that it\u2019s plainly a bad study, and warrants no documentary, no expose, and certainly no recognition at an internationally renowned film festival. Interesting that DeNiro pulled \u201cVaxxed\u201d because filmmakers were backing out. \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016 Eric Boodman at Stat News  Robert De Niro Defends Discredited Idea Linking Vaccines to Autism \r\n That echoes a strong theme in the \u201cVaxxed\u201d documentary, which holds that the CDC has covered up vital data and committed fraud. It\u2019s based on concerns that a CDC scientist, William Thompson, raised about a study that he and several colleagues published in the journal Pediatrics in 2004. But as the conspiracy theory grew, Thompson came forward with a public statement. He said he wanted to make \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that he believes vaccines save lives and that he would never advise a parent not to vaccinate. \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016 Simon Delott at Fishwrapper  Robert De Niro Continues to Disappoint \r\n \r\n No, De Niro, this isn't some sort of conspiracy. There are basically two reasons that people didn't want the film shown. \r\n The first is that it's not just a falsehood -- it can actually do harm. Some people -- a small minority, but some of them anyway -- will believe it. They'll latch onto it because the bogus cause-and-effect story \"sounds right\" to them. Maybe they like conspiracy theories. Maybe they're just afraid of needles. Children get sick when we lose herd immunity thanks to people opting out of vaccines. \r\n Secondly showing something like this lends credibility to the idea. Which is, as we said, harmful. Those jerks would get to slap \"screened at the Tribeca Film Festival\" stickers on every copy of their movie. They can sell their movie and put it online for people to watch, but showing it at Tribeca is giving them a platform that they do not deserve. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016 Anna Merlan at Jezebel  Robert De Niro Promotes All Kinds of Anti-Vaccination Nonsense in Wild Today Interview  \r\n \r\n The hosts gently asked De Niro if he knew there\u2019s a broad scientific consensus that vaccines don\u2019t cause autism. \r\n \u201cI believe it\u2019s much more complicated,\u201d he answered. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016 Hilary Lewis at The Hollywood Reporter  Robert De Niro Talks Autism and Vaccines: \"I Want to Know the Truth\" \r\n \r\n Rosenthal, who claimed the fest has \"equally controversial\" movies still in its lineup, also seemed to feel that Vaxxed had been given more than enough attention. \r\n \"Clearly the festival has about a hundred other movies that are in the festival,\" she said. \"This was only going to be screened once. They've certainly had their voice and their time.\" \r\n \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016 Maria Puente at USA Today  Robert De Niro says he believes in link between vaccines and autism \r\n \r\n But numerous studies by doctors and medical researchers have not found any such link. Moreover, Vaxxed and its creator have been discredited: It was directed by Andrew Wakefield, the \"father\" of the anti-vaccine movement, who first linked vaccinations and autism in a 1988 report that later had to be retracted. Also, his medical license was revoked. \r\n De Niro's return to the vaccines-cause-autism conflict threatened to upstage his latest honor. GLAAD's annual excellence award goes to media professionals \"who have made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance\" of LGBT people. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016 Rachel Paula Abrahamson at US Magazine  Robert De Niro: My Wife Saw a Change in Our Autistic Son After He Was Vaccinated \r\n Discredited doctor Andrew Wakefield directed the film. In 1998 he published a paper in medical journal The Lancet suggesting a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and childhood developmental delays, but no other researchers have ever been able to replicate his findings. Wakefield\u2019s paper \u2014 based on just 12 subjects\u2014 was rescinded by the journal in 2010, and he was barred from practicing medicine in the U.K. after the General Medical Council charged him with dishonesty and abusing developmentally challenged children. \r\n \r\n April 14, 2016 Byron Whyte MD at The Scientific Parent  What Is Thimerosal and Why Is It In My Kid\u2019s Vaccines? \r\n In spite of the overwhelming, worldwide, scientific evidence that vaccinations are safe and effective, claims of \u201ctoxins\u201d and \u201cpoisonings\u201d continue on the internet and at family gatherings. I won\u2019t link to them here, but trust me. My job, as I see it, is to continue to fight the good fight against vaccine misinformation. The more people understand what we are giving their children, the more vaccine uptake and suffering prevented. \r\n \r\n April 14, 2016 Phil Plait at Slate  Robert De Niro Defends Anti-Vax Nonsense \r\n \r\n And that\u2019s the irony here. The interviewer asks him if he wanted to air the film \u201cto start a conversation,\u201d and De Niro says, \u201cTo shut (the conversation) down, there\u2019s no reason to. If you\u2019re a scientist, let\u2019s see. Let\u2019s hear. Everybody doesn\u2019t seem to want to hear much about it. It\u2019s shut down. And [to the interviewer] you guys are the ones who should be doing the investigating.\u201d \r\n But the investigating has been done. Over and again. And every time, when the studies are done properly, the results are the same: Autism isn\u2019t linked to vaccines. Again, this shows De Niro hasn\u2019t done his due diligence here. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 14, 2016 Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence  Raging Bullsh*t: Robert De Niro is the latest celebrity antivaccinationist to spew pseudoscientific nonsense to the world \r\n You know, despite apologetics for De Niro that I\u2019ve read, I\u2019m sorry, I know antivaccine. De Niro is antivaccine. Either that, or he\u2019s doing a very good imitation of being antivaccine. Hell, I could play antivaccine Bingo! with this interview. It hits all the major antivaccine talking points, complete with the \u201cI\u2019m not \u2018anti-vaccine\u2019; I\u2019m pro-safe vaccine.\u201d De Niro states it word for word! He\u2019s also wrong. This is a question that\u2019s been asked and answered many times. Vaccines are not associated with autism. Scientists have already looked at this on multiple occasions. \r\n \r\n April 14 2016 Andrew Gregory at The Mirror (UK)  Why Robert De Niro is wrong about a link between autism and MMR vaccinations \r\n Health experts stressed there is \u201cno credible evidence\u201d of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism after Hollywood superstar Robert De Niro claimed a connection.\r\n \r\n \r\n April 14 2016 Skeptical Raptor at Skeptical Raptor  Anti-vaccine Robert De Niro morphs into Jenny McCarthy \r\n \r\n We all want safe vaccines. But guess what De Niro \u2013 we already do. Unless, you\u2019re a fan of the Nirvana fallacy, where if something isn\u2019t perfect, it must be junk. No vaccines aren\u2019t perfect, but they are probably safer than any medical procedure out there. \r\n Let\u2019s take a closer look at his nonsense. \r\n Trace Amounts?  Bad movie that pushes bad science and several outright lies. \r\n CDC whistleblower? Oh come on,  that\u2019s been utterly debunked \r\n Vaccines and autism? How many times do I have to say this.  Vaccines have nothing to do with autism.  They aren\u2019t linked. There\u2019s no correlation. And there\u2019s no causation. Robert De Niro can say it a billion times, and it\u2019s not going to be true. \r\n And vaccine safety once again? Wait, I\u2019ve heard this before. The claim that \u201cwe just want safe vaccines.\u201d Who said it? Ah, I remember. That daft actress, Jenny McCarthy, who continually claims that  she\u2019s not anti-vaccine, just wants safe vaccines . \r\n ....But the anti-vaccine Robert De Niro has no viable claim to authority, expertise, or knowledge on vaccines and autism. He should just shut up. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 14, 2016 Tanvier Pearl at The Stir  Robert DeNiro Wants 'Safe Vaccines' & There's Nothing Wrong With That>/a>\r\n \r\n While I don't agree with everything Robert DeNiro says about vaccinations, I do think he has a point in wanting the movie to be seen. Why can't we have a heart-to-heart conversation in the parenting world about vaccines, the pharmaceutical companies, and those moms and dads who strongly feel there's more to the debate than meets the eye -- or CDC report? \r\n At the very least, I think such a discussion would (hopefully) empower folks on opposing sides to agree to disagree in a more cordial way -- instead of damning someone for something you don't agree with. In my opinion, vaccinations do and have saved lives, but that doesn't mean I'm not open to hearing more about the reasons why other parents choose not to vaccinate their kids. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 15, 2016 Julianna LeMieux at American Council on Science and Health  Dear Robert De Niro... \r\n \r\n If you have watched \u201cVaxxed\u201d (produced by Andrew Wakefield, co-written by Andrew Wakefield, and starring Andrew Wakefield) you gave Andrew Wakefield 90 minutes of your time to make his point. And, although he is a complete failure as a physician, a scientist and an ethical person, he is a mastermind at making his own corrupt actions sound convincing. \r\n I am asking you today, then, to give the scientific community 90 minutes. What we won\u2019t bring are anecdotal, and emotional, stories from parents or heart tugging videos of children with developmental challenges (both made even more convincing when embellished with the right music and the right lighting). \r\n What we will bring to the table are peer reviewed scientific articles full of robust data that are clear, and were collected using the scientific method. If you give us the chance, we\u2019ll teach you why cutting this film from your festival is a decision that you can feel proud of and why you have the full support of the scientific, medical and public health communities behind you. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 15, 2016 Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence  Raging Bullsh*t, part 2: J. B. Handley enters the fray to defend Robert De Niro\u2019s antivaccine stylings \r\n And personally, I remain dumbfounded at Handley\u2019s apparently belief that he knows what he\u2019s doing when analyzing science. Contrary to Handley\u2019s claims, childhood vaccination schedules are evidence-based. Contrary to his claims elsewhere, the relationship between thimerosal in vaccines and autism has been studied\u2014many times!\u2014and no relationship to autism has been found; it is a failed hypothesis. There is no correlation between the antigen load from vaccines and the risk of autism, and there is no correlation between autism and the on-time receipt of vaccines compared to dosing vaccines later. In other words, a key antivaccine talking point, \u201ctoo many too soon\u201d is not valid. There are even monkey studies (once touted by Handley) showing no correlation between vaccines and autistic-like symptoms. \r\n \r\n April 15, 2016, Maggie Fox at Today\u00a0 De Niro says 'find the truth' on vaccines: But scientists already did \r\n But scientists have debunked, often multiple times, every assertion that De Niro makes. They've been made and knocked down many times in the past 20 years as a small but highly vocal group of vaccine critics raise them. \r\n \r\n April 16 2016 Catherine Bennet at The Guardian  Movie stars have their uses: medical science isn\u2019t one of them \r\n \r\n Although purportedly a factual work, Vaxxed, to judge by numerous early reviews, transports viewers to a world where none of the above [Wakefield's disgrace] ever happened. In this parallel world, it is the immunisers, not the former gastroenterologist, who go in for cover-ups. So comprehensively is contradictory evidence ignored here that Wakefield permits himself the liberty of rehashing some of his earlier \u2013 utterly discredited \u2013 claims, which seemed good reason to many of us, in 1998, to worry about the MMR jab. \r\n The Lancet piece warned of \u201cdevelopmental regression\u201d. This time, he throws in the prediction that, if MMR usage continues, half of all America\u2019s boys will be on the autistic spectrum by 2032. To be fully apocalyptic, his message requires autism itself to be portrayed \u2013 deploying footage of distressed-looking children \u2013 as an invariably frightful diagnosis. It is as if Wakefield wants parents to panic anew with the same, injurious consequences for the understanding of autism. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Articles Agreeing with Mr. De Nero: Vaccines are Unsafe and Cause Autism  \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016 JB Handley at Medium  What\u2019s with DeNiro\u2019s Tribeca co-founder, Jane Rosenthal? \r\n \r\n Jane Rosenthal is closely aligned with a view of autism that many of us strongly disagree with, and it goes something like this: \r\n \r\n Autism is genetic, and it\u2019s a condition of the brain \r\n Pharmaceutical drugs will be developed that can keep autism in check, and we already have some promising drugs to fight autism \r\n Or something like that. Basically, autism is the next great profit center for pharmaceutical drugs and genetic engineering. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016 Matt Agorist at The Free Thought Project  De Niro Finally Speaks About \u2018Vaxxed\u2019 \u2014 \u2018People Should See it, There\u2019s a Link to Autism\u2019 \r\n While we have everyone from attorneys to biologists, to political scientists who write for the Free Thought Project, none of us are doctors, so we do not make recommendations about what you and your family should do in regards to vaccination. That being said, when we see critical information about vaccines being kept from the public, we will expose it every single time. \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016 Tami Canal at March Against Monsanto  Robert De Niro Defends Controversial Autism Film: \u2018Let\u2019s Find Out The Truth\u2019 \r\n The mainstream media has shown zero journalistic integrity as far as investigating the facts that comprise the film VAXXED. Why isn\u2019t it headlines news that CDC senior scientist-turned-whistleblower Dr. William Thompson handed over evidence to Congressman Bill Posey proving that he, Dr. Frank DeStephano, Dr. Coleen Boyle, and Dr. Julie Gerberding were a part of a team that literally threw away the futures of hundreds of thousands children? These respected scientists decided that the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s profit margin was more important than the lives of innocent children, so they callously destroyed the damaging evidence in a trash can. \r\n \r\n April 14, 2016, Mike Adams at Natural News,  Robert De Niro denounces medical totalitarians: 'Let the people see VAXXED' and decide for themselves what the evidence shows \r\n Nearly all pharma-controlled media outlets also insist that any link between vaccines and autism has been \"disproven.\" See this Daily Mail article by Hannah Parry, which parrots the typical propaganda. In reality, the link has been known by the CDC for well over a decade, but it has been deliberately hidden. If hiding scientific truth is to be accepted as \"disproving\" something, then the entire field of science deserves no credibility at all. \r\n \r\n April 14, 2016 JB Handley at Medium  Who should parents trust, Robert DeNiro or Dr. Ari Brown? (Because one of them has to be lying) \r\n AAP Spokespeople , and many other interested parties shamelessly lie about the studies that have (and haven\u2019t been done) regarding vaccines and autism. \r\n \r\n April 14, 2016 Anne Dachel at Age of Autism Autism  'Today' Freaks Itself Out, Goes Running Back to Pharma \r\n \r\n What Robert De Niro said on the TODAY Show on Wednesday was addressed by NBC on Thursday's show, and what was done was a huge attempt at damage control using industry-backed sources. The network had to dispel the idea that De Niro put forth, that vaccines can cause autism. \r\n In typical mainstream media style, NBC cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a doctor from the American Academy of Pediatrics, Ari Brown, in support of the safety of vaccines and in opposition to the possibility of any link to autism. (The vast web of pharmaceutical industry ties to the AAP were, of course, not included.) \r\n \r\n \r\n April 14, 2016 Dan Olmstead at Age of Autism  De Niro Drops Da Bomb \r\n \r\n I don't know what impact Robert De Niro's interview on the Today show Wednesday will have on those who don't believe vaccines cause autism, but I do know the effect it has already had on those who do. The word is \"galvanic.\" This was a call-up-your-friends moment, and we don't get those too often. \r\n It's been, as they say, a long cold lonely winter, and I'm not speaking meteorologically. The condescending and ridiculous premises of books like Neurotribes and In a Different Key; the refusal of those I call the \"greasy nothing-burgers\" in Congress to confront the William Thompson revelations; the long slog of the Merck mumps whistleblowers; the removal of Vaxxed from the Tribeca Film Festival; the triumph of SB-277 forcing vaccine mandates on California schoolkids; all of it is very wearing. And I say that without having an affected child. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 16, 2016 Lori Alton at NaturalHealth365  Robert De Niro wants to know the truth about vaccines and autism\" \r\n \r\n In an obvious attempt to refute public perception that she and De Niro had given into pressure from the pharmaceutical industry, Rosenthal insisted it was filmmakers (not sponsors or donors) who threatened to boycott the festival \u2013 unless the film was pulled from the lineup. De Niro jumped in, stating, \u201cI find that amazing, and we are going to talk about that.\u201d He later added that at the time, he did not even want to ask where the resistance was coming from, \u201cBut now I will ask.\u201d \r\n When Rosenthal further attempted to move the interview away from the topic of vaccine dangers by pointing out that the festival had included a film on the life of a family with an autistic child, De Niro became visibly agitated, interrupting her and pointing out that the documentary she was referring to was beautiful, but did nothing to further the debate over vaccine dangers. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 16, 2016 Paul Thomas at Health Impact News  Pediatrician Dr. Paul Thomas Agrees with Robert De Niro: \u201cLet\u2019s Find Out The Truth\u201d About Vaccines \r\n It is tempting to point fingers, blame vaccines, and be outraged by the way the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have actively closed the door on what, given the rising numbers of children with autism, should never have been a closed issue. It is becoming increasingly clear that the science on the possible link between vaccines and autism has not been done accurately or responsibly, as this senior scientist at the CDC admits. That\u2019s what the movie Vaxxed is about\u2014how the government deliberately and knowingly destroyed data showing a connection between the timing of the MMR vaccine and autism risk in African-American boys. Once we start asking the right questions and stop throwing out the data that does not conform to our pre-existing ideas, we can start getting real answers. \r\n \r\n April 16, 2016 Gary Barnes at TruthKings  De Niro\u2019s Secret Anti-Vaccination Meeting Revealed \r\n It would be difficult to summarize De Niro as anything but a supporter of anti-vaccination premises at this juncture. As speculation has grown and De Niro himself denies any \u201canti-vaccine\u201d sentiment and claims to push only for \u201csafe vaccines,\u201d he is likely learning that to the masses, there is no line of separation. Even the slightest admission that vaccines could cause any negative effects incites the masses to revile your name and creates a stream of social backlash. \r\n \r\n April 16 2016 Levi Quackenboss at Levi Quackenboss  The Unintended Consequences of #VAXXED Getting Axed \r\n \r\nSo, thanks CDC and all of your multiple masks that you hide behind.  Thanks, Jane Rosenthal for being such an uptight control freak.  Thanks Mayor Turner for all of the Texas media coverage.  If MMR rates plummet and the media starts blaming Dr. Wakefield\u2019s movie I hope you think of Barbara Streisand and all of the unintended consequences of your attempts to tell the American public what they can and cannot see.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n As usual, I will keep silently updating this list as new posts appear \r\n Previously Here \r\n \r\n April 2, 2016,  Vaxxed the Movie: Livetweets and commentary by vaccine advocates, skeptics \r\n April 2, 2016  Running List of Reviews of Andrew Wakefield's film, Vaxxed. \r\n April 16, 2016  What Andrew Wakefield Thinks About Autistic People: A Blight . \r\n \r\n Photograph taken sometime between April 3 and April 9, 2016. \r\n \r\n Image Source: Eric Gladen's Facebook, April 13, 2016 \r\n left to right, John Raatz, Jim Carrey, Grace Hightower, Robert F.

On the other hand, there are people who passionately believe that vaccines cause autism. \r\n The \"vaccines cause autism\" belief, while heartfelt, is erroneous and harmful. \r\n This mistaken belief causes harm to autistic people in many ways. One example is that the focus on vaccine causation has diverted time, money, and social resources away from meeting the real needs of autistic people. Another is that the vaccine myth has lead parents to subject their children to harmful and useless \"cures\" such as bleach enemas, long courses of unneeded medications, and/or restrictive diets. \r\n \u00a0Feel free to share.

{"date": "Saturday, May 21, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t The movie Vaxxed has been  widely reviewed . There is nothing new in the movie  that had not been extensively analyzed, starting in 201 4. Many of the people who think the film is important seem unaware that the substantive content of the movie had been published in book form in 2015. \u00a0 \r\n This book,  Vaccine Whistleblower , was reviewed in 2015 by a number of knowlegable people: ScienceMom;  David Gorski  MD PhD;  epidemiologist Ren\u00e9 Najera MPH ; and law professor  Dorit Reiss. \r\n Here are their reviews. \r\n \r\n Monday August 24, 2015: Catherina at Just the Vax:  \"Vaccine Whistleblower\": A Review of the Preface and Foreword \r\n This book is so bad that it's good, so good in the sense that it contains such demonstrably false information and a re-hash of previously debunked claims that I have chosen to review it in parts, the first being the Preface (Boyd Haley) and Foreword (Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (RFK Jr.)), \r\n \r\n Monday August 24, 2015 David Gorski MD at Science-Based Medicine  Vaccine Whistleblower: An antivaccine \u201cexpos\u00e9\u201d full of sound and fury, signifying nothing \r\n The funny thing is, nothing in Vaccine Whistleblower actually demonstrates [wrongdoing at the CDC]. All we have are the words of a very angry man, William Thompson, who clearly has been nursing a grudge against his former colleagues since at least 2003 and is willing to make accusations without significant evidence at them. All we have from this very angry man are a highly select number of transcripts, only four out of over 30, in which this bitter man makes his accusations. It\u2019s all very one-sided, and unfortunately the CDC, probably because Thompson has lawyered up with one of the best whistleblower attorneys in the country, is being painfully vague and discreet in its response: \r\n \r\n CDC is aware that employee Dr. William Thompson has raised concerns regarding an article he co-authored that was published in 2004 in Pediatrics. Consistent with CDC\u2019s existing policies and procedures, the agency, through its Office of the Associate Director for Science (ADS), and in coordination with the HHS Office of Research Integrity, is reviewing these concerns. The agency will provide further information once the review is completed. \r\n \r\n The bottom line is that this book is nothing more than propaganda, and deceptive propaganda at that. The sad thing is that a formerly reputable scientist, William Thompson, provided the grist for the propaganda because he apparently has an ax to grind against his former co-investigators. \r\n \r\n Monday August 24, 2015 Ren\u00e9 Najera at Science-Based Medicine  Vaccine Whistleblower: BS Hooker and William Thompson try to talk about epidemiology \r\n Let\u2019s start by reviewing BS Hooker\u2019s credentials. He is a bioengineer and chemical engineer, not an epidemiologist, despite what the author of the book wants you to believe: \r\n \r\n With the publication of Kevin Barry\u2019s Vaccine Whistleblower: Exposing Autism Research Fraud at the CDC, any claims of credibility for the CDC\u2019s science has collapsed. Barry built his book upon four legally taped conversations between CDC senior vaccine safety scientist Dr. William Thompson and Simpson College professor and epidemiologist, Dr. Brian Hooker. \r\n \r\n Later in the book, in the transcript of one of the conversations between BS Hooker and Thompson, BS gets a list of things he needs to do to earn an \u201chonorary\u201d degree in epidemiology. Among those things was to look at some of the earlier studies that Thompson had coauthored. And BS did. He would go on to write a flawed paper that  I critiqued here  and ended up being retracted,  as I told you about here . That paper alone should tell you everything you need to know about BS Hooker\u2019s epidemiological understanding, but the transcripts given to us by his camp in the form of the book really reveal his ignorance. \r\n \r\n Monday August 24, 2015 Dorit Reiss at Science-Based Medicine  Review of Vaccine Whistleblower: A Legal Perspective  \r\n This post addresses some legal issues raised in the Vaccine Whistleblower book. The first part explains whistleblower protections and how Dr. Thompson\u2019s allegations fit into them. The second part addresses Dr. Thompson\u2019s suggestion of an independent research agency. The third part explains why the book\u2019s claim that school mandates violate international human rights is incorrect. \r\n \r\n \r\n Backstory #1: At the blog Harpocrates Speaks, ToddW has kept an updated guide for parents and media over the story:  MMR, the CDC and Brian Hooker: A Guide for Parents and the Media \r\n Backstory #2: January 4, 2016, Matt Carey at LeftBrain/RightBrain Autism: \u00a0 The William Thompson Documents. There\u2019s no whistle to blow. \u00a0\"Congressman Posey released the documents to a journalist recently and, given that they are now in the public domain, Dorit Reiss and I requested that they be made available to us as well. Mr. Posey\u2019s office graciously granted our request and I have spent some time going through them.\"\u00a0 Here is what you need to remember: \r\n Also, consider this: before Thompson, Wakefield and Hooker didn\u2019t talk about the issues of racial/ethnic minorities. For the most part, the entire \u201cautism is caused by vaccines\u201d community have ignored minority communities. Why? Because [the racial/ethnic minority autism figures] are a clear example that the vaccine hypothesis is a failure. Prevalence estimates for racial/ethnic minority groups have been typically much lower than for Caucasians (Hispanics are diagnosed at a rate of 1/3 that of Caucasians in California. And this has been consistent for over 10 years.) This presents a huge problem for the likes of Hooker and Wakefield. If vaccines are a major cause of autism, why do minority groups have such low prevalences? If they were honest about their own beliefs, they would be calling for a study into the \u201cprotective\u201d effect for minorities. But they don\u2019t. More importantly, if they were real autism advocates they would be calling for better diagnosis, better awareness, better services for these under served communities. Instead they have just ignored these minority communities. That is, until they could use them as part of their campaign against vaccines. \r\n Don't forget that last point. In the last two decades \"vaccines cause autism\" community has demonstrated no (0, null, zero) in engaging with the needs of non-white, low-SES families affected by autism \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.harpocratesspeaks.com/2014/09/mmr-cdc-and-brian-hooker-media-guide.html", "http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Whistleblower-Exposing-Autism-Research/dp/1634509951", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gorski", "http://www.jhsph.edu/admissions/scholarships/institutional-scholarships/brown-scholars/scholars/rene-najera.html", "http://www.uchastings.edu/faculty/reiss/", "http://justthevax.blogspot.com/2015/08/vaccine-whistleblower-review-of-preface.html", "https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/vaccine-whistleblower-an-antivaccine-expose-full-of-sound-and-fury-signifying-nothing/", "https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/vaccine-whistleblower-bj-hooker-and-william-thompson-try-to-talk-about-epidemiology/", "https://epidemiological.net/2014/08/24/directed-acyclic-graphs-and-the-mmr-vaccine-doesnt-cause-autism/", "https://epidemiological.net/2014/08/27/dr-brian-s-hooker-gets-the-andrew-wakefield-treatment/", "http://www.harpocratesspeaks.com/2014/09/mmr-cdc-and-brian-hooker-media-guide.html", "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2016/01/04/the-william-thompson-documents-theres-no-whistle-to-blow/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2016/05/the-book-vaccine-whistleblower-reviews.html", "title": "The Book Vaccine Whistleblower: The Core of the Movie Vaxxed Examined"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 03, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t \r\n The \u00a0 list of papers \u00a0 pictured to the left -- an ever growing number -- has been circulating for some time. Back in the summer of 2013, a group of people addressed the papers in the list (then numbering 86) and showed how the papers did not support the claim. You can read that series beginning here:  Those Lists of Papers Claiming That Vaccines Cause Autism: They Don't Show What They Claim . \r\n But the woman compiling the papers,  Ginger Taylor , likes to reshuffle the list and add papers -- seemingly at random.\u00a0 \r\n Taylor is a loud voice in the \"vaccines do too cause autism\" movement, and  has been since 2004 . \u00a0She has been known to  make much of her \"scientific background \" as a marriage and family therapist but she actually was a  paid political operative . \u00a0Nonetheless, this list keeps being cited, mostly by the scientifically naive, as \"proof\" that vaccines can be causal in autism, and latterly, that  the CDC is covering something up .  \u00a0 \r\n I had been meaning to reconvene the paper study team since last summer, but the project just did not gel. \r\n Thankfully, two other people took up the baton. The first at The Logic of Science is by a pseudonymous scientist who has good reasons for using a pseudonym. The second is by a trauma surgeon who has been writing  Stories from the Trauma Bay  since 2011. He likewise has good professional reasons for blogging under a pseudonym. \u00a0(See this post from the  Pseudonymity Laboratory  for reasons to trust anonymous bloggers.) \r\n The first is  Fallacy Man , who blogs at the excellent blog The Logic of Science. The blog's  mission :\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Teach critical thinking. \r\n Explain how science works and why it is reliable. \r\n Use critical thinking to defend science against the numerous logically flawed attacks that are hurled at it. \r\n \r\n In the blog post  Vaccines and autism: A thorough review of the evidence \u00a0Fallacy Man \u00a0evaluated two lists of \"vaccines don't cause autism\" papers and three lists of papers intended to show that vaccines can cause autism: \r\n Vaccines don't cause autism lists: \r\n \r\n 107 Studies That Show No Link Between Vaccines And Autism  Catherina Just the Vax March 11 2014 \r\n Vaccines And Autism \u2013 Science Says They Are Unrelated  The Original Skeptical Raptor March 24 2016 \r\n \r\n Vaccines do cause autism lists:\u00a0 \r\n \r\n 22 Medical Studies That Show Vaccines Can Cause Autism  Arjun Walia Activist Post September 12, 2013 \r\n 124 Research papers supporting Vaccine/Autism Causation  Ginger Taylor, MS Scribd April 28, 2014 \r\n 30 Solid Scientific Studies That Prove Vaccines Cause Autism  Sean Adl-Tabatabai Your News Wire December 9, 2015 \r\n \r\n Fallacy Man's \u00a0goal of the exercise of going through these papers ( \u00a0enumeration & paragraph breaks added for ease of reading;\u00a0 ) \r\n \r\n I have three key target audiences here. \r\n First, to any parents who are concerned about vaccines and are truly and sincerely looking for good information rather than just trying to find evidence to support their preconceptions, I hope that this post will be a helpful tool for you and will dispel much of the nonsense on the internet. There are so many frightening stories and claims out there that I fully understand why you would be concerned. So I have done my best to thoroughly cover all of the evidence, and I hope that you will carefully consider it.Second, for those who have already reviewed the evidence, but are tired of explaining it over and over again in debates, I hope that this post will provide a resource that will save you some time. \r\n Third, for those who are not particularly interested in the autism/vaccine debate, I hope that this post will provide a nice worked example of how to critically analyze a large body of literature. There are, sadly, a lot of bad scientific publications out there, and it is important that you know how to sift through them and separate the high quality studies from the statistical noise. \r\n Finally, to those who are already convinced that vaccines cause autism, although you are not my target audience, I do hope that you will read this, but I have one simple request to make of you. If you choose to continue reading, then I want you to seriously consider the possibility that you might be wrong and actually examine the evidence presented here. If you aren\u2019t willing to do that, then there is really no point in you continuing to read. \r\n \r\n After a long and detailed discussion of the papers presented in both sets of lists, Fallacy Man concludes: \r\n It should now be clear to you that the evidence really is overwhelmingly supportive of vaccines. Even though anti-vaccers claim to have lengthy lists of papers supporting their position, most of those papers are irrelevant, used weak designs, and had small sample sizes. In contrast, the literature supporting vaccine safety consists of multiple exceptionally large and powerful studies. So there really is no good scientific evidence to suggest that vaccines cause autism. \r\n If you want to use either set of lists, you owe it to yourself to at least glance over the  Logic of Science  post; it is exceptionally thorough and detailed. (Aside: please see Fallacy Man's explanation of  the hierarchy of evidence ) \r\n In the second post,  124 papers that DO NOT prove vaccines cause autism , the author wrote: \r\n \r\n However none of them goes over each of the 124 papers individually. Moreover I've been feeling increasingly uneasy lately about using other folks' blog posts to shoot down this \"proof\". To that end I've decided to do my own... \r\n I've now read every . . . single . . . one of these 124 papers and will address any and all concerns I found relevant. Despite the fact that many of Ginger's links were broken, the titles here are all clickable and go to the original abstract (or the full paper for some of them). \r\n \r\n And so  Doc Bastard  goes through the papers, in order, step by step. His tone is less academic than Fallacy Man's, but the analysis is equally serious.For example, \r\n 69) Pediatric Vaccines Influence Primate Behavior, and Amygdala Growth and Opioid Ligand Binding  If I was laughing at #68, I was rolling on the floor after reading this one. \u00a0This was a pilot study which showed (in its preliminary data) that macaques given childhood vaccines showed some neurodevelopmental deficits. \u00a0The followup 5-year comprehensive study, which was funded by Safeminds (another rabidly antivax group) was  published in 2015 , showed  no differences \u00a0in macaques given the full infant vaccine schedule with and without thimerosal versus controls who were given saline injections. \u00a0I'll repeat for those antivaxxers too slow to understand:  the full infant vaccine schedule was given, the monkeys were followed for 5 years, and there was no evidence of any neurobehavioural differences . \u00a0Feel free to use that reference ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690930 ) with any antivaxxer that tries to claim \"BUT THE VACCINE SCHEDULE HASN'T BEEN TESTED!\" \u00a0Safeminds was, as expected,  not happy \u00a0that their money went to fund a study that refuted their own pre-determined conclusion. \r\n Doc Bastard concludes his review with \r\n AND THAT IS IT. As I was going through every single paper in this list, it became increasingly clear that Ginger simply went to Pubmed, typed in her search terms (thimerosal, mercury, oxidative stress, autism, heavy metals), and copied the links without bothering to read or understand what the hell she was reading. Of the 124 papers presented, exactly -0- of them proves any link between vaccines and autism, and a few even disprove any link. I sincerely doubt that any antivaxxer who sprays this list around the Twitterverse (or anywhere else) has read any of these papers, let alone all of them. Having now read every single one, I feel . . . well, I feel exactly the same. \r\n There are no reputable studies that indicate vaccines can cause autism. And while we are at it, Wakefield's research  has not been replicated . Except in the sense that it has,  courtesy of epidemiologist Reuben Gaines . \r\n PS: A medical student tackled  Ginger Taylor's assertions about vaccine causation  back in 2009 at Heal Spiel. It is still worth a read.\u00a0 \r\n \u00a0Updated May 4 2016 :\u00a0Iida Ruishalme, a Finnish cell biologist living in Switzerland, writes the blog  Thoughtscapism  (again, highly recommended).

{"date": "Wednesday, April 27, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Tom Leonard is The Daily Mail's US Correspondent. According to  LinkedIn , Leonard is based in Brooklyn. Leonard has a little problem with factual reporting, at least related to Wakefield, vaccines, and autism, as his  April 22 2016 article on Wakefield and De Niro  showed. \u00a0Let's start with the offensive. \r\n Either way, both sides in this vicious battle hopefully realise the most important thing is never to lose sight of the main goal \u2014 finding a cure for this soul-destroying condition. \r\n Soul-destroying ?  My contempt for Leonard knows no depths.  Finding a cure?  How about finding ways so that autistics are accepted and supported as the over-arching goals. \r\n Back to the article. \r\n Furious with the British medical establishment, Wakefield moved to the U.S. He founded the Thoughtful House Center for Children to further his work on autism and set up a non-profit organisation to commission studies into the condition. \r\n Well, not quite. By all accounts,in 2001  \"Dr Wakefield resigned from his \u00a350,000 a year NHS post \" while  The Daily Mail and other UK papers   launched a Wakefield support campaign . At some point in 2001, Wakefield moved to Florida to work with Jeff Bradstreet's Christian medical organization, The Good News Doctor Medical Foundation (which seems to have gone out of business), and or Bradstreet and Jerry Kartzinel at  International Child Development Resource Center . Remember that Wakefield was unlicensed to practice medicine outside the UK. Then in March 2004,   Ten co-authors on the 1998 Wakefield Lancet paper issue a retraction and editor of the Lancet says, with hindsight, they shouldn't have published the paper . \r\n During the same 2004 time period, a group of wealthy parents who believed in the vaccines-cause-autism myth  set up Thoughtful House in Austin, Texas  and  hired Wakefield , at a  reported $250,000 per year salary .\u00a0From say 2004 to 2010, Wakefield was employed by Thoughtful House at quite the generous salary. In late January 2010, the UK's General Medical Council found Wakefield to be a  dishonest, irresponsible doctor . After the guilty verdict, Wakefield  either resigned , or was  forced to leave , Thoughtful House in February 2010. \u00a0Then in late May, 2010, Wakefield was struck off t he UK medical register . \u00a0What did Wakefield do between 2010 and 2015? \u00a0Well, there was the  Strategic Autism Initiative , which again was lucrative for Wakefield but did not produce much in the way of research results, and seemed to have petered out in 2013.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, he's been involved with the Autism Media Channel.\u00a0 \r\n Leonard writes of Wakefield's \"work on autism\". \u00a0First, whatever qualified Andrew Jeremy Wakefield to \"work on autism\"? \u00a0He trained as a gastroenterologist, not a psychiatrist or neurologist or pediatrician, the medical specialities that most often provide useful services for autistic children. \u00a0 What has Wakefield ever done to improve autistic lives? \u00a0Many feel his work has actually  harmed the autistic communities . \u00a0 But back to the article. \u00a0  \r\n The movie contains a bombshell revelation:  the existence of a 1994 study (pre-dating Wakefield's findings in The Lancet)  by the U.S. government's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that buried the suggestion the MMR jab was associated with a 340 per cent increased risk of autism in African-American boys \r\n Uh no, just no. The film Vaxxed is all about  DeStefano 2004 \u00a0and  Brian Hooker's botched reanalysis .\u00a0\u00a0I have no idea what Leonard is on about with the \"1994\". Hooker's  retracted study is old news from 2014 .\u00a0 Here is another howler: \r\n With the commercial value of holding the licence to make a government-prescribed single vaccine worth as much as $30 billion a year in the U.S., Vaxxed suggests that rich pharmaceutical companies could hardly have had a stronger vested interest in promoting their vaccines. \r\n Leonard is making stuff up, or Wakefield is. I n 2014 the  entire world market  for all vaccines, including animal vaccines was $30 billion . But back to the article.\u00a0 \r\n As for Wakefield, he tells me he hasn't 'earned a cent for three and a half years' as he and his wife, Carmel, a classical music radio DJ, survive off the proceeds of selling their home in Kew, South-West London. He now calls himself a professional filmmaker. \r\n Oh sure. \u00a0Wakefield raised $400,000 for a 90-minute film that recycles a lot of old footage.\u00a0I wonder how much Wakefield is being subsidized by say  Barry Segal or Claire Dwoskin . I wonder what his fee was for t he ConspiraSea cruise ? \r\n Not surprisingly, many parents of autistic children believe Wakefield, although discredited by his peers, raised worrying issues. \r\n It would be more accurate to say that maybe <0.01% of autistics and maybe 10% of the parents of autistic children buy into the \"vaccines cause autism\" myth. Tom Leonard should be ashamed of his shoddy journalism.\u00a0 ------ Mike Stanton contributed to the analysis in this article. \u00a0 An  index of the reviews for Vaxxed can be found here . \u00a0Also see An index of articles discussing  Is De Niro's Demand for \"The Truth\" about Safe Vaccines and Autism Justified ? \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-leonard-14936b54", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3554747/Why-Niro-backing-MMR-doctor-hounded-Britain-Actor-believes-triple-jab-risks-covered-pharmaceutical-giants-son-developed-autism-overnight-vaccination.html", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3513365.stm", "http://www.badscience.net/2008/08/the-medias-mmr-hoax/", "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jan/28/mmr-doctor-timeline", "http://briandeer.com/wakefield/wakefield-quack.htm", "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jan/28/mmr-doctor-timeline", "http://www.johnson-center.org/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/magazine/mag-24Autism-t.html?_r=0", "https://www.texasobserver.org/autism-inc-the-discredited-science-shady-treatments-and-rising-profits-behind-alternative-autism-treatments/", "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jan/28/andrew-wakefield-mmr-vaccine", "http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/british-doctor-resigns-as-head-of-austin-autism-ce/nRqdL/", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/02/18/andrew-wakefield-pushed-out-by-the-board/", "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/may/24/andrew-wakefield-struck-off-gmc", "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2014/11/07/andrew-wakefield-paid-316k-to-administer-80k-in-grants-by-the-strategic-autism-inititiative/", "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2014/08/26/autism-atlanta-mmr-serious-questions-and-also-how-brian-hooker-and-andrew-wakefield-are-causing-damage-to-the-autism-communties/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754936", "http://www.harpocratesspeaks.com/2014/09/mmr-cdc-and-brian-hooker-media-guide.html", "http://www.stats.org/african-american-boys-and-autism/", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/global-vaccine-market/pipeline-analysis/prweb11519787.htm", "http://www.harpocratesspeaks.com/2013/08/a-snapshot-of-deep-pockets-of-anti.html", "https://violentmetaphors.com/2016/02/15/an-interview-with-andrew-wakefield/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2016/04/-tom-leonard-and-the-daily-mail-inaccurate-and-deeply-offensive-.html", "title": " Tom Leonard and The Daily Mail on Wakefield, Vaxxed, and Autism: Inaccurate and Deeply Offensive "},
{"date": "Sunday, May 15, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t The movie  Vaxxed ,  produced and directed  by Andrew Wakefield, also features a British woman, Polly Tommey, who appears in several scenes in the movie and is listed as one of the seven producers. \u00a0She has also been appearing with Del Bigtree and Andrew Wakefield at Q&A sessions following screenings of the movie. Ms. Tommey is well-known in UK autism circles, but not so well in the US. \u00a0 \r\n A bit of backstory: in the UK, the dominant autism organization is the National Autistic Society (NAS), which began as a group of parents meeting in a private home in 1962. By 1965, the organization had opened a school for autistic children; by 1972 the organization held a national conference on autism, and by 1997, NAS had organized and funded a national helpline ( you can see a timeline of NAS achievements here ). it is worthwhile to note that NAS has  several autistic \u00a0board members . The focus of NAS has been to improve the quality of life for autistic people across the life-span, and has run several remarkable autism acceptance campaigns (see the 2008 \u00a0 I Exist for example ).\u00a0 In 1997, Jonathan and Polly Tommey's second son, William (\"Billy\") was born. According to a 2009  interview with The Evening Standard , Billy developed normally for the first 13 months of life, and began suffering health woes thereafter. \u00a0Mr. Tommey, who was a fitness instructor, began to research dietary and other interventions. \u00a0One of the treatments popular at the time in the US was intravenous secretin, a hormone. (See  John Wills Lloyd's assessment from 1998, and updated in 2014 ). \u00a0As recounted in their book  Autism: A Practical Guide to Improving Your Child's Quality of Life , the Tommeys arranged to obtain supplies of secretin from the US and have it administered under medical supervision six times between\u00a0November 1998 and September 1999. \u00a0Somehow, the Tommeys were put in touch with Trevor McDonald, a prominent television figure in the UK, and \"Billy's Story\" was broadcast on ITV on  April 29, 1999 .\u00a0 \r\n The Tommeys said that subsequent to the airing of the Trevor McDonald program, they received \"thousands\" of messages from parents of autistic children who were in desperate need of help. The Tommeys started a newsletter, The Autism File, which eventually became a glossy magazine. In 2007, the Tommeys established a charity,  The Autism Trust .\u00a0 \r\n Ms. Tommey was back in the UK national news in 2009, with a billboard campaign directed at then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Both  Michael Fitzpatrick  and  Mike Stanton  urged Prime Minister Brown to ignore Tommey's campaign.\u00a0 \r\n Fitzpatrick: \r\n \r\n ...in the interests of children and families affected by autism, I hope that you will refuse support for her key activities \u2013 upholding discredited links between vaccines and autism and recommending unproven and untested fringe treatments. \r\n \r\n Stanton \r\n The greatest danger is not that Ms Tommey and the Autism Trust are going to persuade the government to follow their lead. But by muddying the waters with their campaign they may give the government an excuse to back pedal on existing commitments while they consult with this self appointed autism constituency. The best way forward is to get behind the NAS campaign and keep up the pressure for the provisions of the autism bill to become law. \r\n Notably, the Autism Trust was not one of the backers of the landmark 2009  Autism Bill sponsored by The National Autistic Society \r\n In 2010, Tommey started another billboard campaign:   \r\n Guardian reporter Amelia Gentleman called it:  Attention-grabbing antics for autism \r\n Tommey is controversial in other ways, too. Her desire for residential centres for people with autism is not universally supported, with many other charities advocating that care should be brought into the wider community. Her magazine's focus on nutritional remedies has raised questions: her husband, a nutritionist, runs the Autism Clinic, a private practice offering treatment through dietary modifications. \r\n Much of the content of The Autism File consisted of  articles in support of Andrew Wakefield . Wakefield was  forced out of his position at Thoughtful House in 2010 , after the General Medical Council struck him off the UK medical register. \u00a0Tommey continued vocal in her \u00a0support of wakefield\u00a0 \r\n In January 2013, The Texas Observer published a long article ,  Autism Inc.: The Discredited Science, Shady Treatments and Rising Profits Behind Alternative Autism Treatments \r\n The founder of Autism File is a woman named Polly Tommey, who is also the mother of an autistic child. In 2010, according to an Observer review of records kept by the Texas Secretary of State, Andrew Wakefield registered a company called The Autism File Global in Texas, listing Tommey as a fellow manager. In June 2011, an amendment was filed changing the company\u2019s name to the Autism Media Channel. Today, its website contains general autism tips, diet and nutritional information, and various embedded videos, many of which feature Tommey. Wakefield remains a director of the company. \r\n On April 6, 2013, The Guardian published Alex Hannaford's \u00a0article,  Andrew Wakefield: autism inc , which among other things details the many interrelationships, professional and personal, between the Wakefield family and the Tommey family. \u00a0Mike Stanton gave his opinion of why the Tommeys might have left England.\u00a0 \r\n According to Mike Stanton, British author of Learning To Live With High Functioning Autism and the father of a son with Asperger's syndrome, the Tommeys are now \"linked to these people in America who think diseases are better than vaccines \u2013 that diseases will give you immunity and vaccines will kill you. [Tommey] knows Wakefield is a busted flush over here. That's why they've gone over there.\" \r\n The Tommeys moved from England to the  Austin area of Texas in October 2012 . In March, 2015,  Cassie McKee at Four Points News \u00a0interviewed Polly Tommey. Local landowners Berta Bradley, and her daughter, Lisa Eckhart, donated 40 acres of land to the Autism Trust USA to build a residential facility for adult autistics. In the year since, little progress has been made on building the facility.\u00a0 \r\n In 2013, Wakefield and Tommey were working  on an autism reality TV show . \u00a0As part of that effort,  they became involved  with the family of Alex Spourdalakis, the autistic young man later  brutally murdered  by his  mother and godmother , in June, 2013. \r\n \r\n Tommey and her Autism Media Channel worked with Dorothy Spourdalakis - recording the public pleas for help. \r\n \"He needs something simple, in the country, where he can run around, get the treatment that he needs so he can get better,\" said Dorothy Spourdalakis, Alex's mother, in the YouTube video. \r\n \"She was crying and so was the godmother. They were both in a terrible state - that's why we did that plea in the hospital for help,\" said Tommey. \r\n \r\n In January 2015, Wakefield released a direct-to-DVD film, Who Killed Alex Spourdalakis, which was r eviewed by autism parent and advocate  Matt Carey. Tommey is listed as the producer. \r\n \r\n Alex deserved better in life. He deserved medical care, be it psychiatric, standard medical or both, to bring him back to the happy person he was before his crisis. But Alex also deserves better in death. He deserves that his life and death not be used as a tool to promote Andrew Wakefield\u2019s poorly supported one-size-fits-all approach to autism. He deserves to be the story, not have his story framed as \u201cwho killed Alex Spourdalakis\u201d. \r\n Alex deserves better. \r\n \r\n In the summer of 2014, Wakefield's associate Brian Hooker released a paper that was withdrawn from publication in a matter of weeks. \u00a0In the meantime, Wakefield and Tommey released videos  hyping the story . \u00a0In the fall of 2014, an early trailer for what was then called \" Feast of Consequences \" was released  and Matt Carey reviewed it . \u00a0(Here is an  account of a presentation Wakefield gave under the \"Feast of Consequences\"  title.) \r\n \r\n If Mr. Wakefield weren\u2019t doing so much damage to my community, his videos would be laughably bad. \u00a0I\u2019m not laughing. \r\n \r\n Evidently Wakefield and Tommey spent much of 2015 developing the film that was released as \"Vaxxed\". \u00a0 \r\n Here is Tommey's self-written biography from the Vaxxed website: \r\n \r\n PRODUCER Polly Tommey is the mother of Billy, a 20-year old boy with autism, a book author, founding Editor-in-Chief of the world\u2019s preeminent autism magazine The Autism File, and Autism Media Channel\u2019s TV host and award-winning documentary film producer (\u201cWho Killed Alex Spourdalakis\u201d). \r\n An outspoken autism advocate and founder of the not-for-profit Autism Trust in the UK and US, Polly has appeared in print and television media around the globe, gone head-to-head with top political leaders, and never compromised. \r\n She has received multiple nominations and awards from, among others, The Women of The Year Foundation, Red magazine, and the British Society of Magazine Editors. She is also a Producer on \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe.\u201d \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n On May 13, Orac at Respectful Insolence examined  Polly Tommey's claim that she is not anti-vaccine . \r\n \u00a0 \r\n Image source:  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1164799/Mothers-unite-World-Autism-Day--8216-If-want-heard-noticed-8217.html \r\n\r\n Updated to add: This masterful synopsis of the film.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 24, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t There's a young podcaster, Justin Kanew, of  Get It Got It Good . \u00a0I admired his interview  with Steve Silberman .\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Recently he kicked off a series of interviews with the following statement: \r\n \r\n Let me say right up front that my wife and I have a 2-month old daughter, and that my #1 goal here is to learn as much as possible about how to care for her health, because if anything happened to her I honestly don't know what I would do. \r\n Until recently - like most people - I assumed vaccines were 100% safe, and I thought anyone who thought otherwise was dangerous and selfish, putting everyone else at risk. I thought this because I was told this, by many people, many times. \r\n \"The science is in.\" \r\n \"Vaccines are 100% safe.\" \r\n Lather, rinse, repeat. \r\n \r\n \r\n You see the problem right away, I think. No one should have been telling Kanew that vaccines are 100% safe. Nothing in life is 100% safe. Vaccination is a medical procedure; all medical procedures have inherent risk. Here's what we know about the vaccines given to children: they are very safe, and orders of magnitude safer than the diseases they prevent. \u00a0I get it that young parents are fearful -- I remember my daughter being that young, and how I'd hover over her: Is she still breathing? Is everything OK?\u00a0 Unfortunately, Kanew found some skilled propagandists to fan his fears to the blazing point, namely the producers of the film Vaxxed. Kanew wrote, \r\n Right after my wife gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, we heard about the documentary \"Vaxxed\", and how it had been yanked from the Tribeca Film Festival. We didn't pay it much attention until we saw the Today Show interview with the usually quiet Robert Deniro who said he regretted pulling it, and seemed sure there was more to the story than people wanted to believe. \r\n What Kanew didn't read was responses to De Niro's interview, for example: \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016 Manny Alvarez MD at Fox News  Dr. Manny: I'm talkin' to you, De Niro -- autism is not caused by vaccines \r\n \r\n When it comes to health, false promises and misinformed theories lead to inefficient therapies and dead end research. At the end of the day, it leads to anger and the misperception that somebody \u201ccaused\u201d whatever medical hardship you\u2019re facing to happen to you, and that is not a good starting point when it comes to autism. After 25 years of watching the rates of autism increase, we are faced with two challenges in this field. One: we must do more for these young adults entering the real world. We need more education, more job opportunities, better government support and full integration into society. Two: we must support genuine autism research. We must find out where autism originates, which could possibly begin in the womb. \r\n Creating an environment of suspicion only delays what we must accomplish today. De Niro, I need you and your celebrity pals to concentrate on today. I know that you chose a different career path than I, and that it takes many years of scientific training to understand cellular biology, but that is not an excuse to give any form of validity to Wakefield\u2019s quack claims. Rather than acting as a mouthpiece for conspiracy theorists and the like, it\u2019s time for you to use your celebrity power for good and help me, a father like you, get the answers we want. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016, Russell Saunders MD at The Daily Beast  Robert De Niro Sticks Up for Anti-Vaxx Documentary \r\n \r\n I would happily sit down with De Niro, pause Vaxxed at any moment of his choosing, and rebut every single point he cares to mention.... And there is  a perfectly good, accurate movie about vaccines  for people who want to watch one. \r\n But it is lamentable that once again a celebrity has cast in his lot with people willing to ignore, deny, or even misrepresent medical science. De Niro\u2019s comments not only shake his credibility as an arbiter of quality documentary films, they have the potential to make our country less safe from disease. \r\n \r\n \r\n April 13, 2016 Rupal Pinto, MD, FAAP at Doc2mom  The story they don\u2019t want you to hear \r\n There\u2019s nothing like a new celebrity wagging his finger at the medical establishment to make a doctor-mom want to vomit. A lot. The most recent iteration: Dr. (okay, not a doctor) Robert DeNiro stating that physicians and researchers have not been paying sufficient attention to the conversation about whether vaccines are related to autism (Antique Spoiler alert: they\u2019re not.) Doctors deal with this issue every day \u2013 thanks to the work of charlatans like Andrew Wakefield \u2013 and millions of dollars have been spent trying to see if there is a relationship. No relationship has been found. Mr. DeNiro says that \u201cnobody wants to talk about it.\u201d Not true. We talk about it often with patients and we all do our reading and our homework and I have personally read that horrific Wakefield study enough times to know that it\u2019s plainly a bad study, and warrants no documentary, no expose, and certainly no recognition at an internationally renowned film festival. \r\n \r\n \r\n There are more responses at  Is De Niro's Demand for \"The Truth\" about Safe Vaccines and Autism Justified? \r\n So you see, Justin Kanew, thoughtful people have been thinking about these issues for quite some time. Maybe you should interview them. I imagine Russell Saunders (which is a  nom de blogue ) would make quite a good interview. \r\n Next:The film Vaxxed convinced Mr. Kanew that there was a cover-up at the CDC. There's no coverup.  It's a manufactroversy ginned up by Hooker and Wakefield. I explain why. \r\n\r\n Updated to add: This masterful synopsis of the film.

I\u2019d love to see someone go through and explain about each of those papers. \r\n Ask and you shall receive. \r\n Tietje explained how she collected the papers she listed: \r\n Anyway. You get the point. There is clear evidence. And these are just the studies I was able to pull up in about 15 minutes\u2019 time. Imagine if I spent hours? It would be more than that kid spent \u2014 and far more than \u201creading a forwarded email.\u201d (Sounds more like his \u2018research\u2019 honestly.) \r\n In 15 minutes of research,Tietje would hardly have had time to read each of the abstracts, let alone evaluate each paper on its merits. Let's see what the convenience sample contained. \r\n Papers 1 and 2 are by the research team of Lujia Tomljenovic and Christopher A. Shaw. The World Health Organization's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety  reviewed two of Shaw & Tomljenovic's papers  at their June, 2012 meeting: \r\n \r\n The GACVS reviewed 2 published papers alleging that aluminium in vaccines is associated with autism spectrum disorders and the evidence generated from quantitative risk assessment by a US FDA pharmacokinetic model of aluminium-containing vaccines. \r\n GACVS considers that these 2 studies are seriously flawed. The core argument made in these studies is based on ecological comparisons of aluminium content in vaccines and rates of autism spectrum disorders in several countries. In general, ecological studies cannot be used to assert a causal association because they do not link exposure to outcome in individuals, and only make correlations of exposure and outcomes on population averages. Therefore their value is primarily for hypothesis generation. However, there are additional concerns with those studies that limit any potential value for hypothesis generation. These include: incorrect assumptions about known associations of aluminium with neurological disease, uncertainty of the accuracy of the autism spectrum disorder prevalence rates in different countries, and accuracy of vaccination schedules and resulting calculations of aluminium doses in different countries. \r\n \r\n Paper #1  Tietje titled it \u201cAluminum adjuvants in vaccines likely causally linked to autism\u201d =  Do aluminum vaccine adjuvants contribute to the rising prevalence of autism ?

This is the time when I should point out that this study was funded by the Dwoskin Family Foundation, which was founded by Claire Dwoskin. Mrs. Dwoskin is a board member of the horribly misnamed National Vaccine Information Center, a public charity anti-vaccination advocacy group. Shaw and Tomljenovic have been speakers at conferences with such other speakers as antivax neurosurgeone Russell Blaylock, MD, NVIC founder Barbara Loe Fisher, and Andrew Wakefield.

Geier the father is a delicensed physician; Geier the son has a batchelor's degree and has been sanctioned for practicing medicine without a licence. \u00a0You can read criticisms of their scientific escapades, for example:\u00a0 Plagiarism Complaint  \u00a0\u00a0 Why the latest Geier & Geier paper is not evidence that mercury in vaccines causes autism ;  Dr. Mark Geier Severely Criticized ;  Looking back at two decades of Geier   Is Mark Geier finished as an expert witness in the vaccine court? \u00a0and\u00a0  Chemical castration of autistic children leads to the downfall of Dr. Mark Geier .\u00a0 \r\n The Geiers are practicing  Fairy Tale Science . In this case, what the Geiers are doing is continuing to collect \"evidence\" that exposure to minute quantities of ethyl mercury (in the form of thimerosal) can cause autism. To put it another way, they are asserting that autism is a novel form of mercury poisoning. \r\n \" Tooth Fairy science\" is an expression coined by Harriet Hall, M.D ., (aka the SkepDoc) to refer to doing research on a phenomenon before establishing that the phenomenon exists. Tooth Fairy science is part of a larger domain that might be called Fairy Tale science: research that aims to confirm a farfetched story believed by millions of scientifically innocent minds. Fairy Tale science uses research data to explain things that haven't been proven to have actually happened. Fairy Tale scientists mistakenly think that if they have collected data that is consistent with their hypothesis, then they have collected data that confirms their hypothesis. Tooth Fairy science seeks explanations for things before establishing that those things actually exist. \r\n It was a reasonable concern in 1999 that something about thimerosal exposure might contribute to autism. Since that time, numerous studies have been done evaluating that hypothesis. In 2006, Offit and Gerber published a review of the evidence to that date: \u00a0 Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses , summarizing the studies in Table 2 (below):\u00a0 \r\n In 2010, Hurley, Tadrous and Miller published  Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines and Autism: A Review of Recent Epidemiologic Studies . \u00a0Remember, as Fallacy Man has shown,  systematic reviews are the strongest form of evidence. \u00a0 Multiple lines of evidence show that thimerosal in vaccines is not causal in autism.\u00a0 \r\n But back to analyzing the papers that Tietje is promoting:\u00a0 \r\n Paper #6 \u00a0Tietje titled it \"Mercury exposure can cause autism\" =  A comprehensive review of mercury provoked autism.

This will give you extraordinary statistical power, but, the result that you get may not actually be applicable to humans.

Really. \u00a0I was calling on a neighbor two houses down the other day and could clearly hear him... from inside my house. Just talking about what he was hoping was available for snack.\u00a0 \r\n To be honest, a lot of Mr. Idaho's ways chap my hide. I find being addressed by a Drill Sergeant \u00a0aversive -- I don't like being blared at. I could say he is \u00a0a  bull in a china shop . And so on. In the olden days, before I had autistic friends, I might have had the idea that I could shame or discipline Mr. Idaho out of ... being who he was by nature.\u00a0 \r\n But then I met for example, Julia Bascom, who let me peek into her world with the  The Obsessive Joy Of Autism . \u00a0And many have spoken of  the cost of passing for neurotypical. \u00a0Cynthia Kim's article  Acceptance As A Well Being Practice \u00a0is particularly insightful. So I shifted my point of view. \u00a0My goal has become to find time and space to allow and encourage Mr. Idaho to be his natural self, his loud, exuberant, boisterous self....in ways where he doesn't run into limits or inadvertent bad outcomes. \r\n I would not have gotten to this place of seeking settings for Mr. Idaho to be himself without the wisdom and guidance of my autistic friends. Thank you. And Mr. Idaho thanks you. He is a happier, more confident, more joyous boy.\u00a0 Edited to add: if you have favorite essays about the cost of passing, or how acceptance has changed your life, or similar topics, please put links in the comments.\u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNn9H1LR2Tw", "http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/bull+in+a+china+shop", "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/04/05/the-obsessive-joy-of-autism/", "http://www.autismacceptancemonth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AAM-Burnout.pdf", "https://musingsofanaspie.com/2015/01/14/acceptance-as-a-well-being-practice/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2016/05/i-want-to-thank-my-autistic-friends.html", "title": "I Want To Thank My Autistic Friends"},

Handley publishes the post Is Paul Offit's Wife Internet Troll/Autism Father \"Sullivan\"?, which he makes the following promises:    \r\n Wednesday, April 27 2011  at LeftBrain/RightBrain, Kev Leitch (with Matt Carey's permission)\u00a0 publishes  Sullivan Outs Himself , and asks      if Mr. Handley is going to make good on his promises, above. \r\n Friday, April 29 2011  At Age of Autism, J.B. Handley publishes the post Matt Carey says He's Bonnie Offit (Just Kidding), and promises to make good on his promise.      \r\n Friday, April 29, 2011  J. B. Handley emails Matt Carey, indicating that he will transfer the domain name to Paul Offit and suggests that Age of Autism host an interview between J.B. Handley and Matt Carey.  \r\n Friday, April 29, 2011  Matt Carey posts  \"An Apology to Mr. J.B. Handley  at LeftBrain/RightBrain \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n Monday, May 2, 2011,  at approximately 10:30 pm PST, J.B. Handley emails a third party (possibly the owner of the PaulOffit.com registration, possibly just an associate who manages Handley's domains), who I will call  Agent.  Handley requests that Agent  \"Give the site back to Paul Offit, or at least give him the right to register the domain name\", and gives Agent Dr. Handley's work email.  \r\n Tuesday, May 3, 2011  at approximately 9:30 am PDT,  Agent replies to  J.B. Handley via email, indicating:                     \r\n \r\n The PaulOffit.com site had been updated (presumably replacing all content with a simple image of the Disney/Pixar character Sullivan \r\n The domain is unlocked and  anyone can request a transfer \r\n Mr. Handley would receive an email from Register.com to indicating that a request for transfer had been submitted, and that such an email would require some action from Mr. Handley to confirm that transfer. \r\n  Agent also indicated that he had used some process at Register.com using Dr. Offit's work email. \r\n \r\n \r\n Between May 3 and May 11,\u00a0 the story gets murky  \r\n \r\n J.B. Handley made the following claims (in a blog comment sent to my blog and others on May 14 at approximately 8 am PDT):                   \r\n \r\n Dr. Offit received an email on May 3 giving him the right to claim the PaulOffit.com domain \r\n The right to claim said domain expired after \"72 hours\" \r\n Dr. Offit did not exercise that right, therefore the domain was \"available to anyone to register.\" \r\n \r\n \r\n Dr. Offit was unaware of any email from Register.com between May 3 and May 13 \r\n Dr. Offit did not take any steps to \"claim\" the PaulOffit.com domain \r\n Agent apparently did not email Dr. Offit directly to indicate that action was needed, either on May 3 or later. \r\n J.B. Handley apparently\u00a0 did not email Dr. Offit directly either on May 3 or later. \r\n According to two conversations  Matt Carey had with the Register.com  helpdesk:             \r\n \r\n It is not the policy of Register.com to \"simply unlock a domain after 72 hours\".  In other words, Mr. Handley was either mis-informed or mis-spoke. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n May 5, 2011  J. B. Handley again to Matt Carey, indicating that an email had been sent, offering the domain name, to Dr. Offit. \r\n Wednesday May 11, 2011 , sometime before noon, the PaulHandley.com domain ceased to display merely the Disney/Pixar character Sullivan, and instead displayed this image :      \r\n Confusion ensues  \r\n \r\n Given Mr. Handley's previous statements that the domain was \"up for grabs\", it is assumed that a third party has gained ownership of the domain; \r\n The site is credited to an anonymous person who goes by the handle of  M. Wazowski,  also a Monsters Inc. character.  \r\n Mr. Handley had previously sneered at those who use pseudonyms for blogging. \r\n \r\n \r\n Wednesday May 11, 2011  I publish \"J.B. Handley Forsworn\" \r\n Thursday May 12, 2011  A number of bloggers  call J. B. Handley to account.   In particular, Todd W. Harpocrates Speaks publishes  Integrity and Honesty   \r\n Saturday May 14, 2011  J. B. Handley leaves identical comments at a number of blogs.  The original is at Harpocrates Speaks .  The comment made the following allegations and claims:     \r\n \r\n  Dr. Offit is lying \r\n Dr. Offit is a habitual liar \r\n Register.com sent an email to Dr. Offit on May 3 offering the transfer of the site to him \r\n Dr. Offit recieved said email \r\n Dr. Offit had and knew he had\u00a0 a period of 72 hours in which to claim the site \r\n \u00a0Dr. Offit failed to act \r\n J. B. Handley's comment implied, but did not state directly that the domain PaulOffit.com had been claimed by a third party -- neither Mr. Handley nor Dr. Offit  \r\n \r\n \r\n Sunday, May 15, 2011  Paul Offit receives an email from Register.com offering him the site from J.B. Handley.  \r\n Monday May 16, 2001 , in a blog post to Age of Autism, J.B. Handley repeats the \"72 hour\" canard.\u00a0 He goes on to write,\u00a0 \"As an additional courtesy, on May 15th, 12 days after offering profiteer the site for the first time, I asked the person controlling the site to send a SECOND email, offering the site again.\"  \r\n \u00a0     \r\n \r\n Please recall that comments at Age of Autism are very heavily moderated. No comment appears that does not have the full approval of at least one editor\r\n \r\n One commenter was allowed to post the Offits' home address ( I have a screenshot of this comment, if it is removed later.\u00a0 For obvious reasons, I'm not posting it here.) \r\n One commenter allowed to lie about the registration date:     ( this comment was later removed ) \r\n One commenter is soliciting for additional libel against Dr. Offit     \r\n One commenter bragged about setting up another cybersquatting site to defame Dr. Offit  \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n According to two conversations  Matt Carey had with the Register.com  helpdesk:         \r\n \r\n The domain PaulOffit.com passed directly from Mr. Handley (or Agent) to Dr. Offit \r\n The transfer was initiated and completed on Sunday May 15. \r\n \r\n \r\n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/04/sullivan-outs-himself/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/04/an-apology-to-mr-j-b-handley/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/05/pauloffit-com-a-tempest-in-a-teapot/", "http://silencedbyageofautism.blogspot.com/2011/05/integrity-and-honesty.html", "http://silencedbyageofautism.blogspot.com/2011/05/integrity-and-honesty.html?showComment=1305384945207#c1262538907565093634", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/05/pauloffit-com-a-tempest-in-a-teapot/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/05/the-pauloffitcom-saga-timeline-.html", "title": "The PaulOffit.com Saga: Timeline "},

More discussion at  Respectful Insolence . \r\n\r\n Back in 2008 I told you about the scandal of Boyd Haley  marketing a powerful industrial decontaminant as a \"dietary supplement\" used to \"heal\" autism.  Kathleen Seidel of Neurodiversity did the groundwork with her articles A  Fine White Powder , the  Industrial Treatment  and  An Inquiry Emerges .  \r\n\r\n The Food and Drug Administration took their time, but finally, June 17 2010, issued a warning letter to Haley and his company.  As reported in  the Chicago Tribune :\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nA product promoted to parents of children with autism is not a harmless dietary supplement, as claimed, but a toxic unapproved drug that lacks adequate warnings about potential side effects, including hair loss and abnormalities of the pancreas, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned in a letter to its maker.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe FDA's June 17 letter to Boyd Haley, a retired Kentucky chemist and hero to the autism recovery movement, details five violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act related to his product, OSR#1. Failing to correct such violations can result in fines, seizure of products and even criminal prosecution.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKathleen Seidel at Neurodiversity has a  summary and the entire warning letter .  \r\n\r\n \r\nRemember, the product marketed as OSR#1 was developed to be an industrial decontaminant. In  Fuel for Thought , Seidel analyzes a paper on the product's primary use, comparing it to Haley's use as a \"food supplement\".  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProf. Haley's  first response to the FDA warning  claimed the product was safe. In  A Bevy of Adverse Events , Seidel  collates online discussions of OSR's side effects .  \r\n\r\n The company marketing OSR,  CTI Science ,\u00a0 lists the following dosages and warning:  \r\n\u201cRecommended dose of OSR#1 for adults is 100 mg once daily\u2026 Recommended dose of OSR#1 for children 55-100 pounds is 100 mg once daily.  OSR#1 is not recommended for children under 55 pounds or under 4 years of age.\u201c \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn  The Littlest Consumers , Seidel reports that DAN! practitioners (who may be nurses or chiropractors in addition to physicians) have been providing OSR to children as young as 20 months and as light as 26 pounds.\r\n\r\nSeidel closes with:\r\n \r\n\t\r\n\t Needless exposure of children to inadequately tested, potentially hazardous substances is indefensible , regardless of whether the instigator is a multinational corporation, an academic research center, a public residential institution, or a powder-peddling moonshiner working the alternative autism treatment hero circuit.\r\n .\n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/209/", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/07/boyd_haley_finally_does_the_right_thing.php", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/168/", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/169/", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/170/", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/ct-met-autism-chemical-20100623,0,7088247.story", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/205/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/206/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/06/boyd-haley-comments-on-the-fda-warning-letter/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/207/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/207/", "https://www.ctiscience.com/CTIScience", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/208/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/208/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/07/the-boyd-haley-osr-scandal.html", "title": "The Boyd Haley / OSR Scandal"},

I do not care if other people think he behaves strangely or makes funny noises; as long as he is not harming or interrupting anyone, we carry on with heads raised, meeting stranger's stares with confident and unapologetic smiles that I will admit to having practiced in the bathroom mirror. \r\n\r\n Here are some of the tactics that make excursions with Leo, and hopefully some of his friends, a bit easier. Please feel free to leave your own suggestions in the comments. \r\n \r\n\r\n Right now I'm on vacation and I think I've spotted an adult on the spectrum right here, a fellow guest with me.  I'm so grateful to my blog friends like  Rory  and  Rachel Cohen-Rottenburg  who have shared what it is like to be on the spectrum.  I know what things I might do that may make our shared experience more enjoyable for me (and I hope, for my fellow guest). \r\n\r\n Jennifer Byde Myers, one of my fellow editors at  The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism , is about to undertake a cross-country adventure with her family, including her son Jake who has autism and mobility issues:  Have Autism, Will Travel .

Upon discovering that Wakefield did not disclose payments from a law firm to underwrite some of the research, in 2004 ten of the 12 co-authors renounced the study.  Following an investigation by journalist Brian Deer, in 2007 the British General Medical Council (GMC) launched an investigation.  In January 2010, the GMC ruled against Wakefield on all the charges.  In February 2010,  The Lancet  withdrew the paper.  On 24 May 2010 he was struck off the United Kingdom medical register. On January 5, 2011, the British Medical Journal published an article and editorial, documenting that Wakefield extensively edited data in the 1998 paper with the intent of benefiting from litigation and from sales of an alternative vaccine he had patented. \r\n Reactions to  Secrets of the MMR scare: how the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed \u00a0 \u00a0 from parents of children with autism and adults with autism--condemning Wakefield \r\n The most thorough overall coverage of the story has been from LeftBrain/RightBrain.

Jacobson , MD\u00a0 posted that he had a \u201cproblem\u201d with the proposed ad on the AMC community feedback board: \r\n http://getsatisfaction.com/amc_theatres/topics/remove_the_unfounded_anti_vaccine_message_from_your_ads \r\n There was not much response to the post\u00a0 until early Sunday November 21st, when  Elyse Anders posted a suggestion at Skepchick that skeptics support Dr. Jacobson\u2019s \u201cproblem\u201d . \r\n Around 11:30 EST, one of Skepchick\u2019s commenters posted the link to Dr. Jacobson\u2019s petition, and suggested that readers respond.The link was repeated by a number of\u00a0 twitter users with thousands of followers, such as P.Z. Myers and Phil Plait. \r\n The numbers of respondents agreeing with the petition started climbing extremely rapidly. \r\n When there were about 900 respondents, Sunday afternoon, one of AMC\u2019s spokespeople announced that AMC would not run the ad. \r\n By about 9 pm over 1,600 people had told AMC that they were opposed to the airing of the Safeminds ad. \r\n Age of Autism Dips Back Into the Well of Contempible Behavior \r\n Early Sunday morning, December 5, someone (the managing editor?) at Age of Autism posted a photograph of Elyse and her baby to Age of Autism's Facebook fan page, with the caption: \r\n \r\n This is the woman who fought to pull the SafeMinds PSA's from the theatres. It's her FB profile page photo. She is anti-choice and wants to tell you that mercury is safe and that Thimeosal is good - according to her blog. She trolls AofA regularly. As do all the pro-vaccine-injury bloggers. \r\n \r\n Kim Wombles sent me a message alerting me to the attack.  Shortly thereafter, Kim put up a post \" Nasty Business \".\u00a0 Orac at Respectful Insolence followed with  \"The Age of Autism Counterattack Against Skepchick Elyse Begins.\" \r\n Here are a few of the comments at the Facebook page: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n   \r\n Here's a defense of the AoA actions from \"media editor\" Anne Dashel: \r\n \u00a0     \r\n Here's Kim Stagliano's defense: \r\n \r\n Nice. \r\n Skepchick posts on the AMC campaign -- be sure to read comments \r\n \r\n Let's All Go to the Movies and Save Some Lives \r\n AMCs and PSAs -- We Haven't Won Yet \r\n Good Guys Win! \r\n \r\n Other posts: \r\n \r\n November 9 Emily Willingham at A Life Less Ordinary:  Safeminds, Counterpoint to Public Health, wants to run an anti-vax \"PSA\" in Movie Theaters for the Holiday. \r\n November 20 Skeptical Teacher  Antivaccine PSA Coming to a Theater Near You \r\n November 20 James Randi Forum  Antivaccine PSA Coming to a Theater Near You \r\n November 21 Maki at The Bard  Let's Not Get Polio for Christmas \r\n November 21 Autism News Beat  AMC Says No to Shouting Fire in a Crowded Theater \r\n November 22 Orac at Respectful Insolence  Battleground Movie Theaters: Skeptical Activism vs. the anti-vaccine movement \r\n November 25 David Gorski at Science-Based Medicine  Be Thankful No Anti-Vaccine Propaganda at the Movies This Weekend \r\n November 25 Ryan at Skeptic<<Quantum of Knowledge  Score One for the Good Guys \r\n November 25\u00a0 Larry Moran at Sandwalk:  Don't Mess with Skepchick! \r\n November 25 The Skeptical Teacher  Anti-Vaccinationists PSA Won't Be Aired by AMC Theaters! \r\n November 29 Steven Salzberg at Forbes Blogs Science Business  Anti-Vaccine Ads at the Movies \r\n November 29 Michael Rosch at Gotham Skeptic:  SafeMinds Propaganda Blocked by Skeptics \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.mayoclinic.org/bio/11052368.html", "http://getsatisfaction.com/amc_theatres/topics/remove_the_unfounded_anti_vaccine_message_from_your_ads", "http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/11/lets-all-go-to-the-movies-and-save-ourselves-some-lives/", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2010/12/nasty-business.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/12/the_age_of_autism_counterattack_begins_a.php", "http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/11/lets-all-go-to-the-movies-and-save-ourselves-some-lives/", "http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/11/amcs-and-psas-weve-not-won-yet/", "http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/11/good-guys-win/", "http://daisymayfattypants.blogspot.com/2010/11/safeminds-counterpoint-to-public-health.html", "http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/11/20/anti-vaccination-psa-coming-to-a-theater-near-you-literally/", "http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?p=6576733", "http://maki.page8productions.com/archives/1598", "http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/1357", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/11/battleground_movie_theaters_skeptical_ac.php", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=8404", "http://aquantumofknowledge.wordpress.com/category/skeptic/", "http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2010/11/dont-mess-with-skepchick.html", "https://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/11/25/anti-vaccinationists-psa-wont-be-aired-by-amc-theaters/", "http://blogs.forbes.com/sciencebiz/2010/11/29/anti-vaccine-ads-at-the-movies/", "http://gothamskeptic.org/safeminds-propaganda-blocked-by-skeptics/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/12/age-of-autism-dips-back-into-the-well-of-contemptible-behavior.html", "title": "Age of Autism Dips Back Into the Well Of Contemptible Behavior"},

Most notably was  The Lancet \u2019s decision to retract Andrew Wakefield\u2019s article which claimed a link between vaccines and autism. Recently, Chris Mooney interviewed Paul Offit on the popular podcast  Points of Inquiry , hosted by Chris Mooney. In the interview, Offit discusses the state of the vaccine skeptic movement in light of [the news about Wakefield]. In particular, Offit explores why the tides may be turning on the movement\u2014as well as the grave public health consequences of ongoing vaccine avoidance.  \r\n \r\n Following the interview, Mooney wrote about three insights: \r\n \r\n\t   Waking the Silent Majority . Many parts of children with autism do not agree with the idea of vaccine causation and are angry that it has dominated public discussion of autism \r\n   How the medical publishing industry contributed to the anti-vaccination hysteria \r\n The anti-vaccination fervor is contributing to the resurgence of vaccine-preventable illnesses \r\n \r\n Columbia University Press filmed an interview with Dr. Offit as a part of the book's launch  \r\n\r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cupblog.org/?p=1575", "http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-14636-4/autisms-false-prophets", "http://www.pointofinquiry.org/paul_offit_the_costs_of_vaccine_denialism/", "http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/02/15/insights-from-the-paul-offit-interview-part-i-waking-the-silent-majority/", "http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/02/16/insights-from-the-paul-offit-interview-part-ii-blame-the-journal-not-the-media/", "http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/02/17/insights-from-the-paul-offit-interview-part-iii-the-resurgence-of-diseases/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/autisms-false-prophets-out-in-paperback.html", "title": "Autism's False Prophets Out in Paperback"},

{"date": "Thursday, March 25, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Update the last:  Smockity posted the following on her blog on March 30, 2010: \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nFrom the very beginning, I have always wanted this blog to be a blessing, something to help others, and never to hurt. I wanted to make people laugh, even in the midst of parenting trials.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nIt has become evident that I have not achieved that goal. I have unintentionally caused hurt and pain and for that I am truly sorry.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nWhen I described a situation I observed recently, I was seeing in my mind and describing on my blog behavior that I have witnessed dozens of times in my own seven children and hundreds of students during my eight years as a school teacher. The behavior I described was nothing more to me than childishness and impatience, but I can see now that the words I used were viewed as symptoms of autism and many people were offended.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe most grievous part, for me, is that this has brought dishonor to the name of Christ, and that is wholly the opposite of my life\u2019s mission.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nIt is my sincere hope that this apology will bring healing and peace.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n I am sure that it was a hard journey to get to that apology, which I find heart-felt.\u00a0 I am grateful for her apology, and I share her wish for peace and healing. \r\n\r\n Update #5  I have heard from a friend of Smockity's that she's received emails that attack her personally for her religious practices, or which call her vile names.\u00a0 I fully and totally condemn such behavior, and have rebuked the commenters,\u00a0 below, who tread a little too close to the line of attacking Smockity's person rather than condemning her statements. \r\n\r\n Update #4 (#s 1, 2, & 3 are at the bottom)  Smockity, if you happen to come here and read this, please know that in your post you\u00a0 ridiculed behaviors (like toe-walking, hand-flapping, and perseverating) that many of my friends' children exhibit -- behaviors they can't control, any more than a child with paralysis can get up and walk normally,\u00a0 or a blind child can see.\u00a0 I dearly hope that you can come to imagine the hurt these parents encounter, and resolve to be more accepting and more welcoming in the future. \r\n\r\n About a year ago, my real-life friend Squid, who has three children, one with autism,\u00a0 wrote a post about a  very harrowing trip she took to Costco , in which her middle child (with autism) had a meltdown. Please know that if you see a child who looks too old to be having\r\na tantrum going into full tantrum mode, there's a good chance that\r\nchild is autistic. It's okay to watch and see if the adult has the\r\nsituation under control \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSquid's post changed my behavior. I now  always  offer to help when I see a family struggling as she did with her tribe of three. I don't care any more if I'm rebuffed -- the offer matters.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n The deal is here: many children with neurological challenges to their behavior appear to be perfectly normal.\u00a0 Until you really have the tools to  see . \r\n\r\n Which brings us to today's topic: in which a  homeschooling mother of seven  observed a child, and did not  see . She blogs at  SmockityFrocks .\u00a0 I want to be generous to this person, even though her post,  In Which Smockity Considers Jabbing A Ball Point Pen Into Her Eye , made me feel....well, quite uncharitable.\u00a0  \r\n\r\n It's possible, given that her family homeschools, and possibly where she lives, she has never met a family affected by autism.

{"date": "Tuesday, December 08, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t My my my. The Age of Autism post referenced below,  http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/12/dr-paul-offit-on-national-public-health-radio.html .... has been removed from the Age of Autism site.  \r\n\r\n Click on the link and all you get is a white screen.  \r\n\r\n \r\nBut my dear editors at Age of Autism-- that really isn't effective, you know? There are various ways of looking at,  and capturing  .... disappeared content. Including comments that  your heavily moderated site allowed. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere are any number of people who have screenshots not only of this post & the comments you allowed, but many of the previous posts (and attendant comments).  \r\n\r\n Just sayin'.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\r\n On November 30th,\u00a0 a n informative  interview with Steven Novella MD, Paul Offit MD, and Phillip Alcades PhD was released on podcast: \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nAs the anti-vax campaign rages, parents are just saying \u201cno\u201d to vaccines. But now the incidence of childhood diseases such as whooping cough are on the rise.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nA number of studies have refuted the link between vaccines, autism and other chronic conditions, yet the anti-vaccine movement continues. Find out why. Also, how the media have irresponsibility framed the debate.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nPlus, we panic over plague, sweat about swine flu, but don\u2019t think twice about jumping in a car and roaring down a crowded highway at 70 mph. Discover why most of our health worries are overblown.\r\n \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s Skeptic Check\u2026 but don\u2019t take our word for it!\r\n \r\n\r\n Age of Autism  (AoA) bills itself as the \"Daily Web Newspaper of the Autism Epidemic\".\u00a0 On December 7, responded with an article critical of the broadcast \" Dr. Paul Offit on National Public (Health) Radio .\" Media Editor Anne Dachel took issue with many of Offit's and Novella's statements and identified the program being broadcast by National Public Radio.  \r\n\r\n Because I'd heard the podcast over the weekend, I posted several comments to AoA indicating that the attribution to National Public Radio was incorrect.\u00a0 AoA moderates its comments very heavily; none of my comments were approved, nor was the attribution corrected. \r\n\r\n The AoA commenters responded with such statements as:\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nNPR IS PART OF THE VACCINATION PIPELINE;\r\nTHEY ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM .\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nStop all support to local NPR stations. During the next pledge drive, send them a letter explaining NPR's gross violation of their mission statement or journalistic standards of objectivity, integrity, or fairness.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nOver the last couple of months, they've had Amy Wallace who attacked JB Hadley. No equal time for JB. Scott Simon (Weekend Edition) had Michael Specter. No equal time for Olmstead, Katie Wright, or any of the writers from from AoA. A couple of weeks ago, Simon had AJ Jacobs \"Vaccines:What you don't need to know.\"\r\nIra Flatow had DA Henderson with his story about Smallpox eradication.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nNPR is clearly, aggressively pushing a biased vaccination agenda, with perhaps NBC a close second. Tonight's Law and Order was that despicable measles episode. Joseph Goebbels could have written the script.\r\n \r\n \r\nand\r\n \r\n \r\nJust when I think they've run out of ways to suck, Offit and Novella prove me wrong.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nAs for NPR, what a disappointment! Pharma likely purchased a block of air time so that their favorite vaccine front man Paul Offit could launch his usual diatribe against \"anti-vaccinationist\" better known as the parents of vaccine injured children.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nNPR gives no opportunity for callers to question Dr. Offit. No dissenting view is offered. Ever. How odd.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nI agree with everyone who said to stop supporting NPR.. time to boycott all media outlets that give a one-sided view of the autism crisis.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere's just one little teeny problem. National Public Radio had nothing to do with the broadcast. It was produced\u00a0 and distributed by an arm of the SETI Institute,  Are We Alone? Science Radio for Thinking Species. \r\n\r\nThat's a pretty basic attribution error, especially from a person who is the Media Editor. \r\n\r\n Don't you think that Ms. Dachel ought to issue a correction and apology to NPR? \r\n\r\n Crickets chirping. \r\n\r\n Update: AoA has changed\u00a0 the attribution, but it is still incorrect as it does not credit Are We Alone?, Skeptic Check, or the SETI Institute. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe latest comment from me:  Anne, I appreciate that you have made a correction at the top of the article,but it isn't sufficient.  \r\n\r\n 1. You alleged that the show was broadcast by NPR, and numerous commenters have gone on to criticize NPR. Your mis-attribution has damaged NPR's reputation among this group. You owe NPR an apology posted prominently at the beginning of this piece.  \r\n\r\n 2. You link to National Public Health Radio Network (NPHRN)as the source of the interview, when in fact they just distributed it. The show was produced and distributed by an arm of the SETI Institute, \"Are We Alone? Science Radio for Thinking Species\". Skeptic Check is one of Are We Alone's recurring features.  \r\n\r\n If Age of Autism is indeed \"a daily newspaper\", accurate attribution AND  Publish correcting and admitting errors should certainly be part of your organization's function.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am not holding my breath that this latest comment will be accepted either. The editors at Age of Autism exert very tight control over what information gets into their little bubble of anti-science and anti-vaccination. \r\n \r\n\r\n Update March 8, 2010.

You can contact Springsteen's publicist at mlaverty@shorefire.com or by phone at 718-552-7171.  \r\n \r\n\r\nAt  AspergerSquare8 ,\u00a0 Bev has a moving, open letter to Bruce Springsteen -- how his music spoke for her, when words failed her, and how she sees Autism Speaks:\r\n\r\n Imagine a group claimed your voice, but allowed you no say. They used your name to spread propaganda, and this propaganda made your life harder, all the while they claimed to exist for your benefit. This is the truth about Autism Speaks.  \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJoe at Club166, the father of a child with autism,  also posted a letter to Mr. Springsteen. \r\n\r\nBob Williams, former Commissioner of The Administration on Developmental Disabilities, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, wrote a letter to Springsteen, part of which was published with permission at Rethinking Autism:\r\n \r\n\t\r\n\tI am writing to strongly urge you not to perform at the Autism Speaks benefit concert in November and ask that you withdraw your offer to do so in protest over its horrendous video, \u201cI Am Autism\u201d.  Watching it left me and others physically ill and deeply outraged much as a hard core porn video or one filled with racial, homophobic or other bigoted images and tirades would do.  Under the supposed guise of promotion a cure of all conditions along the Autism Spectrum, the video strips children and adults on the spectrum naked of their humanity \u2013 sowing the worst of stereotypes, fears and low expectations.  The message it senselessly projects is one of complete dread and utter disdain \u2013 not just of the disability but of those with it as well.\r\n \r\n\r\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/press/seinfeld_springsteen_concert.php", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/postt108186.html", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/09/for-you.html", "http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/09/dear-mr-springsteen.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/10/dear-bruce-springsteen-about-that-benefit-concert-for-autism-speaks.html", "title": "Dear Bruce Springsteen, About That Benefit Concert for Autism Speaks"},

The child, then 7, had autism and was largely non-verbal. In addition, the boy had a severe peanut allergy, suffering hives and swelling if he so much as touched a peanut.\u00a0 In March, it is alleged that Barocas gave the child a  Mr. Goodbar  (a chocolate and peanut confection), in the hopes that the\u00a0 boy would then be too ill to go on a scheduled field trip. \r\n\r\n \r\n\"She gave him the Mr. Goodbar candy bar in an attempt to keep him from going on a field trip to the Indianapolis Zoo,\" said Ron Frazier, the family's attorney.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nFrazier says that's just the beginning of the abuse Young's son endured at the hands of Barocas.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\"She pinched him, that she put him in a room that she called his 'office' and she left him there for extended periods of time,\" he said.\r\n \r\n\r\n{snip}\r\n \r\nAccording to a report from Child Protective Services, provided to Eyewitness News by Frazier, three separate teachers' aides came forward in March, claiming Barocas mistreated two students. One of them being Young's son.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\"He had no way of communicating to me that he was being hurt at school,\" Young said.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe school district said, in a statement, they learned of the alleged abuse last March 16 and called CPS. Three days later, Barocas was put on administrative leave. The district says Barocas told the school in February she would resign at the end of the year for unrelated reasons.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nFrom the Associated Press:\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nA lawsuit filed by the boy's mother, Anita Young, alleges that special education teacher Trinda Barocas told a classroom aide that the boy would likely misbehave and \"maybe he could be sick enough not to attend and we won't have to deal with it.\" Young said her son, Jacob, who is mostly nonverbal, gets hives and experiences swelling if he merely touches peanuts.\r\n \r\n\r\n{snip}\r\n \r\nThe lawsuit said one classroom aide told school officials that Barocas treated the boy like a \"caged animal\" by keeping him for hours in a cubicle that should have been used for short times alone. Barocas also was accused of pinching the boy, standing on his foot so he could not move his leg and grabbing him by the arm to drag him around the classroom.\r\n \r\n {snip}\r\n \r\nThe DCS report said aides also claimed Barocas hit a 9-year-old girl with Down syndrome on the lips in an attempt to make her pull her tongue back into her mouth. Barocas told DCS officials that she would tap the girl with two fingers on her mouth as a physical prompt. Barocas said it was a therapeutic technique, not abuse.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nIn 2007, Barocas was placed on administrative leave in Franklin Community Schools after a nurse told a child's mother that she saw Barocas force-feed the girl, slap her and improperly restrain her, according to The Indianapolis Star. Authorities cleared Barocas in that case. \"I did not, will not and would not hurt a child in my care,\" Barocas told the newspaper at the time.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n Sylvia Tangle   Just News   CFNews13.com  ,  Palm Beach Post  and  NBCTV33.com  -- this is more confusing. Some reports say that Ms. Tangle put hot sauce in a soda and gave the soda to one of her students, a child with autism, to teach him not to grab her soda off her desk. (What's a can of soda doing in the classroom, anyway?) Other reports have Ms. Tangle saying that she \"always\" put hot sauce in her sodas, and the child helped himself to the drink. In any case, a student with autism inadvertently consumed hot sauce in soda, and Ms. Tangle put the hot sauce in the soda. She was convicted of abuse, but not sentenced to jail. She is on two years' probation and must serve 100 (200?) hours of community service. Some parents are upset that she didn't get jail time.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091010/ap_on_re_us/us_candy_bar_lawsuit", "http://www.theindychannel.com/news/18980284/detail.html", "http://www.wthr.com/Global/story.asp?s=11287249&clienttype=printable", "http://www.hersheys.com/products/details/mrgoodbar.asp", "http://www.justnews.com/news/21062762/detail.html", "http://www.cfnews13.com/News/Local/2009/9/23/teacher_spikes_autistic_students_soda_with_hot_sauce.html", "http://www.palmbeachpost.com/state/content/state/epaper/2009/10/08/1008hotteacher.html", "http://www.nbc33tv.com/news/teacher-sentenced-200-hours-community-service"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/10/reasons-5678-7890-and-8123-that-parents-whose-children-are-in-special-education-do-not-trust-the-sch.html", "title": "Reasons #5,678 and #7,890  That Parents Whose Children are in Special Education Do Not Trust The Schools: Trinda Barocas and Sylvia Tangle"},

{"date": "Saturday, November 15, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n In 2004, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), started a campaign called  Learn the Signs. Act Early .  \n\n \n\nHere's the mission:\n\n \n\n It's time to change how we view a child's growth.\n \n\n Message to Parents Do you know all the ways you should measure your child\u2019s growth? We naturally think of height and weight, but from birth to 5 years, your child should reach milestones in how he plays, learns, speaks and acts. A delay in any of these areas could be a sign of a developmental problem, even autism. The good news is, the earlier it\u2019s recognized the more you can do to help your child reach her full potential.\n\n\n On other words, the goal of the campaign is to help all parents\u00a0 know what the normal developmental milestones for their children are and when they should be occurring.\u00a0 If all parents were aware of such milestones as developing a social smile, shared gaze, and other social (and physical) acts,\u00a0 the parent would seek early intervention as soon as possible. \n\n The\u00a0 public relations company  Porter Novelli  has been in charge of developing the  Learn the Signs, Act Early  messages for the CDC.\u00a0 They've put out a Request for Information to authors and illustrators who might be interested in developing   a children's book that promotes developmental milestones to parents while also engaging young children. The goal of te project is to develop a product that encourages positive parent-child engagement, stimulates development, and provides an opportunity for learning about and monitoring important developmental milestones.\n\n For more details,including submission guidelines,\u00a0  Download Milestone_Moments_RFI.pdf \n\n  \n\n Submission Deadline is November 25, 2008 \n\n 2005 article on the Learn the Signs campaign \n\n Learn the Signs homepage \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nablopomo.com/", "http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/actearly/", "http://www.porternovelli.com/site/pressrelease.aspx?pressrelease_id=118&pgname=news", "http://www.toddlerstoday.com/articles/special-needs-kids/one-up-on-autism-3941/", "http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/actearly/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2008/11/attention-autho.html", "title": "Attention Authors and Illustrators: The CDC Wants You for Early Autism Detection Project"},

He is also an anthropologist and he studies autism around the world looking closely at the role culture plays in how societies identify and treat individuals with autism. In this presentation, Grinker will discuss what we can learn about autism diagnosis, care and advocacy from other cultures across the globe. Dr. Grinker will also describe his international research and will explain how this research has affected the choices his family has made in parenting his own daughter, Isabel. Is there an epidemic of autism? Is autism a disability or a disease? These are questions that Grinker will address by sharing his international research and his personal experiences.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nRoy Richard Grinker is Professor of Anthropology, Human Sciences and International Affairs at the George Washington University. Grinker was born and raised in Chicago. He graduated from Grinnell College in 1983 and received his Ph.D. in SocialAnthropology at Harvard University in 1989. He is the author of numerous books and articles, including  Unstrange Minds: Remapping the World of Autism  (NY: Basic Books, 2007). He is currently completing the first ever prevalence study of autism in Korea, funded by Autism Speaks.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nPresented by CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities and Autism Speaks, in collaboration with The Marcus Autism Center; Autism Society of America, Georgia Chapter; CADEF: The Childhood Autism Foundation. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nSources:\r\n\r\n Talk Gwinnett \r\n CDC \r\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=O1csURYb3ssd3PlRfXc1vw_3d_3d", "http://www.talkgwinnett.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=710&Itemid=1", "mailto:sme1@cdc.gov", "http://www.talkgwinnett.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=710&Itemid=1", "http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/ecard/autism-ecard.htmhttp://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/ecard/autism-ecard.htm"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/04/autism-awareness-roy-grinker-speaking-in-atlanta-april-23-2009.html", "title": "Autism Awareness: Roy Grinker Speaking in Atlanta April 23, 2009"},

B. Handley's Generation Rescue and its celebrity mouthpieces Jenny McCarthy and her boyfriend Jim Carrey. The weight of the scientific evidence is that the current vaccine schedule is both effective in preventing disease and safe--as free as possible of side-effects.. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn to Carrey's innuendos. He makes it seem a bad thing that:\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n There are more than 100 vaccines in development,\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Note that the way Carrey's essay is structured leads the reader to believe that 1 00  infant or pediatric vaccines  are in development.\u00a0 Hold that thought. \r\n\r\n Second, note that Carrey never mentions a reason other than \"profitability\" for vaccine development.\u00a0 Don't let his rhetoric confuse you:\u00a0 remember the primary reason for vaccine development:  there are diseases that cause human suffering, disability, and death . The purpose of vaccines is to eliminate the suffering, disability,and death. Hold that thought, too. \r\n\r\n I don't know where Carrey gets the \"more than 100 vaccines in development\" figure.\u00a0 Carrey's estimate of vaccines in development may be low. A  poster at the 2008 National Immunization Conference   indicates that over 400 vaccines are in various stages of development. This does not mean that 400+  diseases  are being addressed through vaccine development, but 400+  vaccine formulations .  \r\n\r\n Are all the vaccines in development for infant or pediatric use?\u00a0 No: many of the vaccines in development would be for adult use: against diseases such as HIV,\u00a0 various cancer vaccines, food-borne illnesses such as salmonella, and tropical diseases. The 400+ figure is for vaccines in all stages of development.\u00a0 Most vaccine formulations is the preliminary phase don't make it even as far as clinical trials. \r\n\r\n Let's back up to Carrey's innuendo:  the profitability of vaccines . \r\n \r\nWith vaccines being the fastest growing division of the pharmaceutical industry, isn't it possible that profits may play a part in the decision-making? That the vaccine program is becoming more of a profit engine than a means of prevention? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis claim is quite disingenious. Yes, the formerly stogy vaccine segment is growing -- but it isn't in the pediatric vaccine sector.   From the 2007 AEIGis report: \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nadult vaccines will see a big spike due to increased uptake of influenza and hepatitis vaccines, predicts a report from Kalorama Information.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nCancer vaccines will also become a major player in the vaccine market, rising from its current level of $135 million to more than $8 billion by 2012.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\"We anticipate phenomenal growth in cancer vaccines,\" Bruce Carlson, the Kalorama Information editor who worked on the report, told United Press International. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom the  Global Vaccine Market Prediction through 2012 :\r\n Owing to lower margins and the mature nature of these markets, the  basic and enhanced paediatric markets are expected to show stagnant growth  in future. On the other hand, launch of a number of new vaccines will make the addiction, cancer and proprietary paediatrics/adolescent vaccine market highly dynamic. On a whole, the global vaccine market is expected to register revenues in excess of US$ 30 Billion by 2012. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCarrey's next next slimy piece of innuendo and one big, fat lie.\r\n \r\n \r\n Paul Offit, the vaccine advocate and profiteer, who helped invent a Rotavirus vaccine is said to have paved the way for his own multi-million dollar windfall while serving on the very council that eventually voted his Rotavirus vaccine onto our children's schedule.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI very strongly object to Carrey's slander here.\u00a0 Step-by-step: \r\n\r\n \u00a0\" Profiteering \" implies an unethical act, associated with price fixing and price gouging. \" Windfall \" means \"Money received which was not expected and not a direct result of something the recipient did.\"\u00a0 The phrase \" while serving on the very council that eventually voted his Rotavirus vaccine onto our children's schedule \" is just a malicious lie. \r\n\r\n Remember the idea that vaccines are developed to prevent  suffering? \u00a0 Here's  the toll for rotavirus \r\nRotavirus is the leading cause of severe acute gastroenteritis among infants and young children, accounting for an estimated 527,000 deaths among children aged <5 years worldwide in 2004 (1,2). In the United States, rotavirus causes few deaths (20--60) each year, but  remains a substantial cause of morbidity  among children, resulting in approximately 55,000--70,000 hospitalizations, 205,000--272,000 emergency department (ED) visits, and 410,000 physician office visits (3). In the continental United States, rotavirus activity follows a distinct winter-spring seasonal pattern (4). In winter months, approximately 50% of hospitalizations and ED visits and 30% of outpatient visits for acute gastroenteritis among U.S. children aged <3 years are caused by rotavirus (5).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Worldwide, rotavirus killed approximately 500,000 per year in 2004. \u00a0 According to an April 2, 2009 report, \r\n Rotavirus is one of the most deadly diseases  children in the developing world face,\" Dr. John Wecker, PATH director of immunization solutions, said in a news release. \"Vaccination holds the key to making this disease one of the most preventable.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \u00a0How is it that Dr. Offit, who worked for 20 years to develop a vaccine that prevents the needless death of infants world-wide, can be said to be a \"profiteer\"?\u00a0 How is his share (whatever the size) of the royalties from Rotateq be said to be \"a windfall\"? \r\n\r\n The lie:\r\n\r\n \r\nPaul Offit...is said to have paved the way for his own multi-million dollar [compensation] while serving on the very council that eventually voted his Rotavirus vaccine onto our children's schedule. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat really happened:\r\n\r\nDr. Offit was a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from  1998 to 2003.  RotaTeq, the vaccine that Dr. Offit helped to create,  was granted approval in February 2006 ,  three years after Dr. Offit's service on ACIP. \r\n \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Dr. Offit's \"conflict of interest\" behavior while serving on the ACIP, as reported by  Sullivan at LeftBrain/RightBrain in August 2008: \r\n \r\n \r\nDr. Offit was a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1998 to 2003. During this time he had to vote on a competitor\u2019s rotavirus vaccine (RotaShield). (People seem to have a habit of confusing RotaShield with Dr. Offit (and team\u2019s) RotaTeq)\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nSo, when RotaShield, the competitor\u2019s vaccine, came up for vote, what Did Dr. Offit say? He voted to include it in the schedule. It\u2019s hard to spin that as something that would benefit Dr. Offit, as it clearly meant that the marketability of his own vaccine was reduced.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nRotashield was found to potentially cause intussusception. The numbers affected were too small to detect in the trial, so this concern was raised after the vaccine was added to the schedule. the ACIP took a vote on whether to remove RotaShield from the schedule\u2014a move that clearly had potential benefits for Dr. Offit, so he abstained.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you are as disgusted as I am by Carrey's lies and misrepresentations, send him a letter via Autism.Change.Org:\r\n\r\n Tell Jim Carrey that hw is wrong about vaccines and autism  from Autism.Change.Org:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAll the publicity surrounding the claims of a vaccine-autism link has diverted attention and energy away from focusing on issues of pressing importance to individuals on the autism spectrum including education and schools, services, employment, and housing.\r\n\r\nAsk Jim Carrey to reconsider his statements about vaccines and autism and, if he wishes to advocate for autism, to rather direct his energies to support services and education for individuals on the autism spectrum. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe suggested text of the letter. Feel free to compose your own message and post it at the Change.org link, above:\r\n\r\n\r\n Dear Mr. Carrey,\r\n\r\n\r\nI have read your recent article in  The Huffington Post , \" The Judgment on Vaccines Is In??? \" in which you assert that \"We don't know enough to announce that all vaccines are safe\" and that further research about a possible vaccine-autism link is necessary. Further research has and is being done, and the scientific evidence refuting this hypothetical link is steadily accruing. Nonetheless, this issue continues to hold the attention of the public and of parents who have become fearful of vaccinating their young children. \r\n\r\n It is unfortunate that, due to your celebrity, many people will listen to your statements about vaccines and even decide not to have their children receive the vaccines that are important for their health. Please reconsider your statements about vaccines and autism and please rather direct your energies to supporting services and education for individuals on the autism spectrum. \r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n Paul Offit 's official website\r\n\r\n Update March 8, 2010.

The District has 12 elementary schools, housing grades K-6 with 2 pre-school programs and 2 developmental kindergarten programs. The District has two middle schools for grades 7-8 and two high schools for grades 9-12. In addition, there is an alternative middle school and an alternative high school. The District also sponsors a school at the Behavioral Health Center. The District also provides services for a comprehensive special education program. All of our schools and programs are fully accredited. \u00a0The student population of the District is over 9,500 students and growing. The Bonneville School District employs over 1,200 people, of whom, almost 500 are certificated personnel.\r\n\r\n District personnel serve over 950 students with disabilities  and over 400 that are considered gifted and talented.

I am very skeptical of their activities. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Both CARE and CASD bill patients' insurance companies for tests and for \"treatments\". According to Barrett, the paid bills have been as high as $40,000.\u00a0  \r\n\r\n Kazuko Irie Curtin's son was diagnosed with autism about 14 years ago.\u00a0 She founded the Center for Autistic Spectrum Disorders as a 501(c)3 charity in 2001, and the for-profit CARE Clinics sometime later.\u00a0 Here is her biography from the November 2008  United States Autism and Asperger's Association conference Kazuko A I Curtin is the founder and CEO of CARE Clinics. Over a decade ago, Kazuko set out to find the very best treatments for her son, James, who was diagnosed with autism at two years-of-age, and given no chance of recovery. Since that time, Kazuko has traveled the world in search of answers for her son.\u00a0 First, Kazuko developed expertise in behavior therapy. She received training in ABA therapy, and invented \u201cAutism Visual Learning Method\u201d, which is patented in the U.S.,  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n According to Barrett, the method, a type of Picture Communication System, is not patented. and is pending in 150 countries. Then she learned about biomedical treatments for James, and began building what later became CARE Clinics.\u00a0 Kazuko was a successful entrepreneur since she was a college student in Tokyo. Among many achievements, Kazuko was a leader at DASCOM, which was an extremely successful computer software company that was later sold to IBM. \r\n\r\n In addition to treating her son, Kazuko has recovered from chronic illness herself, by using the therapies at CARE Clinics. The success of treating both herself and her son has bolstered her resolve to create a world-class treatment center that helps both parents and children recover from difficult, chronic illnesses such as autism and cancer.\u00a0 Kazuko is a frequent speaker at many autism conferences, including UCLA, ASA, ATF, GPL, CASD, which help parents make informed decisions for their children. Kazuko is the author of  New Autism Treatment Paradigm , printed in Japanese, and leads a team at CARE Clinics that is authoring a  New Autism Treatment Paradigm 2008 , printed in English, and to be released April 1st, 2008. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n I couldn't find publication records for  New Autism Treatment Paradigm 2008.\u00a0  However,\u00a0 I did find CASD's IRS form 990.\u00a0 You can read it for yourself:\u00a0  Download CASD_990.pdf \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Kazuko Irie Curtin's 2006 compensation from CASD was $203,833.\u00a0 That's pretty good entrepreneurial change.\u00a0 CASD has a board of three.\u00a0 Curtin, Mary Y. Irie, and Jane N. Irie.\u00a0 There appears to be a lack of independence on the board. \r\n\r\n Dr. Barrett would like to speak with families who have used the services at CASD or CARE.\u00a0 Please read  his article --his phone number is at the bottom of the page. \r\n\r\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t Previous related blog posts and essays \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n Daniel Dage:  The Fleecing of the Autism Community  March 20, 2006 \r\n Kristina Chew:  What Are the Costs?

{"date": "Friday, September 26, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t The  Crisis Prevention Institute  has developed a half-day seminar,  Autism Matters at Work to raise awareness and dispel myths about autism. It is designed to help professionals\u2014those who have occasional workplace encounters with people on the autism spectrum\u2014interact safely, effectively, and respectfully. This seminar provides important information that helps minimize risks and prepares staff for workplace contact with individuals on the autism spectrum. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n \n CPI Announces Autism Awareness Seminar\n[Press Release]\n   \n\n \nSeptember 16, 2008  \n\n In 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that one in every 150 eight-year olds was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Given this high diagnostic rate, it is very likely that employees in a variety of workplace settings will come in contact with someone on the autism spectrum. CPI President Judith Schubert encourages organizational leaders to promote respectful workplaces through employee education and notes, \u201cAnyone who works in a care or service profession can benefit from the practical strategies taught in this training.\u201d\n \n\n \nIn 2006, CPI began offering a 3-day advanced course for Nonviolent Crisis Intervention\u00ae Certified Instructors focused on strategies for care providers working directly with service users on the Autism Spectrum. The course\u2019s popularity led to many requests for more autism-related training, and ultimately, to the development of this half-day seminar. According to Schubert, \u201cOur advanced Instructor course continues to benefit many, but it is more comprehensive than some employee groups need. This seminar will serve a wider audience.\u201d\u00a0 Autism Matters At Work is available to the general public and requires no prior CPI training. \n \n\n \nIn developing Autism Matters At Work, CPI collaborated with Dennis Debbaudt, an advocate for people with Autism and author of Autism, Advocates and Law Enforcement Professionals. According to Schubert, \u201cDennis\u00a0 has worked tirelessly to raise awareness and improve interactions between people with autism and law enforcement-----and his unique perspective relating to safety issues\u00a0 is important for anyone to consider.\" \n \n\n \nJackie Marquette, Ph.D., an author who has focused research and writings on Autism, attended CPI\u2019s debut of Autism Matters at Work last month. \u201cThe attendees of this seminar walk away with a clarity and an understanding of the characteristics of autism, said Dr. Marquette. \u201cThe activities promote favorable responses that can be supportive in times of stress for those with ASD. The approach in the CPI seminar is one of respect and honor for people with autism and other related disabilities. I highly recommend this seminar.\u201d\n \n\n \nDr. Marquette, founder of the Marquette Group\u2014 provides consultation and resources to agencies and families impacted by ASD.\n \n\n \nThe Crisis Prevention Institute is an international training organization that offers training programs and innovative resources to professionals around the world who are committed to creating safe and respectful work environments. CPI\u2019s Nonviolent Crisis Intervention\u00ae training program and the PrepareTraining\u00ae program focus on prevention and offer effective strategies for resolving situations when confronted by anxious, hostile, or violent behavior.\n \n\n \nAutism Matters at Work is part of the CPI Matters at Work Series. The series addresses important issues that impact the safety and well-being of employees, visitors, guests, and coworkers in today\u2019s work environments. An upcoming program in the series, currently under development and slated to be available later this year, will examine what businesses can do to address and help prevent bullying and intimidation in the workplace.\n \n\n \nSince 1980, more than 5.4 million professionals have participated in CPI training programs offered both on-site and at select locations in 146 cities worldwide.

The day of the Autism Twitter Day event, the stream of discussion about autism was so intense that twice during the day it outstripped every other topic on Twitter. For one December day on Twitter, autism was bigger than Obama, bigger than Xmas, bigger than Santa. WOW.\r\n\r\nI tried to capture a bit of the flavor of the event, from how it was arranged and managed, to the significance for the participants. While autism as a condition is on the rise in America, it is still a topic about which most folk are pretty uninformed. Trust me on this. My son is on the spectrum, albeit on the high end of the spectrum, and I know just how little knowledge is typical from conversations with people at church, in the community, peers at work, and even more surprising educators and clinicians who are in the situation of working with my son professionally. I belong to a couple family groups, email groups, subscribe to a couple newsletters and magazines. I buy books that I skim and mean to read but never manage to finish. You know the drill -- what you do when you need to know and care but can't always cope beyond just getting through the day. On any given day, I might typically receive and notice from one to a half dozen communications about autism spectrum concerns. Comparing that to the thousands that streamed past during Autism Twitter Day is impossible.\r\n  \r\n\r\n Anderson put together a digital scrapbook, which is repeated at Autism Family Adventures:  Autism Twitter Day Digital Scrapbook \r\n\u00a0 Squid lead me to P.F.

The book discusses the scientists, politicians, and parent groups that helped fuel the fears that vaccines, or a mercury-containing preservative in them, accounted for a sharp rise in autism cases worldwide, and the scientific work that later showed these fears ungrounded. Throughout, Offit pays attention to the interplay of a number of concerned parties: doctors and scientists, the parents of autistic children, politicians, personal-injury lawyers, and the media. He argues that the public was seriously and dangerously misled about autism and vaccines, and his analysis aims to understand how a specific piece of scientific misinformation was able to spread widely and obtain great traction.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nJoining Dr. Offit to discuss  Autism's False Prophets  are Kristina Chew, PhD, author of the blog  Autism Vox ; Kev Leitch, author of the blog  Left Brain, Right Brain ; Bob Park, PhD, a University of Maryland physics professor and author of the weekly online column, \" What's New by Bob Park ;\" and Orac, the pseudonymous surgeon-scientist author of the blog  Respectful Insolence.

This book reveals that these therapies are far from pioneering interventions and they remain unsubstantiated by scientific authorities. Campaigns promising to \u2018defeat or cure autism now\u2019 have attracted much support among parents struggling with their difficult children. But the crusade against autism risks dehumanising and stigmatising those who are identified as autistic and their families. This compelling book is essential reading for students and professionals working in the field of autism, as well as academics concerned with the public understanding of science and the treatment of scientific and medical controversies in the media. Recently, several \"autism=vaccine injury\" proponents  have spoken in Britain .\u00a0 In addition, mouthpieces for the \"autism=vaccine injury\" lobby have been gleeful\u00a0 ( here ,  here ) over the extent to which McCain seems to have accepted their deluded beliefs.\u00a0 Both events gave Dr. Fitzpatrick pause.\u00a0 In the article at Spiked entitled \" This 'crusade against autism' will do more harm than good \", Fitzpatrick concluded: Many families affected by autism welcome the higher public profile of autism, as reflected in the US election campaign. If this leads to greater resources to enable children with autism to get appropriate schooling and for affected families to get the support that they need, then that will be progress. If, however, resources are diverted into the pursuit of phantom environmental causes \u2013 such as vaccines \u2013 or the promotion of quack treatments or fad therapies, this is likely to have damaging consequences for all concerned.

Can you explain the brain-basis for what we usually call \"attention\"? \n\n MP:  I have been interested in how the attention system develops in infancy and early childhood. \n\n One of our major findings, thanks to neuroimaging, is that there is not one single \"attention\", but three separate functions of attention with three separate underlying brain networks: alerting, orienting, and executive attention. \n\n Alerting: helps us maintain an Alert State. \n\n Orienting: focuses our senses on the information we want. For example, you are now listening to my voice. \n\n Executive Attention: regulates a variety of networks, such as emotional responses and sensory information. This is critical for most other skills, and clearly correlated with academic performance. It is distributed in frontal lobes and the cingulate gyrus. \n\n The development of executive attention can be easily observed both by questionnaire and cognitive tasks after about age 3\u20134, when parents can identify the ability of their children to regulate their emotions and control their behavior in accord with social demands. \n\n SB:  \"Executive attention\" sounds similar to executive functions. \n\n MP:  Executive functions are goal-oriented. Executive attention is just the ability to manage attention towards those goals, towards planning. \n\n Both are clearly correlated. Executive attention is important for decision-making (how to accomplish an external goal) and with working memory (the temporary storage of information). For example, given that you said earlier that you liked my monograph,\u00a0 I have been thinking of the subheadings and sections there as I provide you my answers, using my working memory capacity.

Today as citizens of the world, we face a daunting array of social and environmental problems ranging from health care and education to global warming and economic inequality. For each of these issues, whether local or global in scope, there are millions of people who care passionately about working for change but lack the information and opportunities necessary to translate their interest into effective action. \r\n\r\n Change.org  aims to address this need by serving as the central platform informing and empowering movements for social change around the most important issues of our time.  \r\n\r\nThey are planning to launch a blog on autism, as one of the featured issues.\u00a0 Below the fold, what I sent to Levy. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \r\n \r\nI've read of your plan to start an autism blog here at Change.org at a number of places.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nWhile I am an ardent blogger ( http://lizditz.typepad.com ) and I do cover autism issues,\u00a0 I'm not volunteering for the job for two reasons: One, I think your blogger should be a person with autism, and I'm not a person with autism; Two; in the current episode, I don't have the time.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nI want to pass on a words of friendly advice, though. Be very, very careful who you chose to be your autism editor.\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nAutism can be viewed through many lenses, some reality-based, some not.\u00a0 Among the non-reality-based lenses, or tribes,\u00a0 is the notion that autism is caused by vaccination or environmental toxins.\u00a0 The people in this tribe do not themselves have autism, but may have a child with autism.\u00a0 They refer to their children as \"vaccine damaged\" or \"vaccine injured\".\u00a0 \u00a0 Personally, I suspect this tribe is small, but they are vocal and have significant visibility, in part because they include some wealthy individuals and because they have attracted celebrities such as Jenny McCarthy and Robert Kennedy jr. to their belief system.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThey are ardent and vocal and will lobby hard for the job.\u00a0 This morning, one of the leading vaccine=autism web presences, Age of Autism,  posted the job announcement,  together with all of your contact information.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nIf you select an editor from the vaccine=autism tribe, your selection will destroy  Change.org 's credibility.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe vaccine-autism connection has been thoroughly debunked.\u00a0 Fourteen plus studies have not found any correlation between autism and vaccination.\u00a0 Yet these true believers continue to write and demonstrate their belief that there is too a connection, and the government is covering it up.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n(If you would like a closer look at the vaccine-autism claims and their falsity, I can recommend two books published this fall: Paul Offit, MD:  Autism's False\r\nProphets  ( http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-14636-4/autisms-false-prophets ) and Michael Fitzpatrick, MD:  Defeating Autism: A Damaging Delusion  ( http://www.routledgementalhealth.com/9780415449809 ).\u00a0 Dr. Offit focuses on the vaccine-autism mania in the US, while Dr. Fitzpatrick's book is on vaccine-autism mania the UK.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThere's no room for \"balanced reporting\" -- any more than there's room for \"balanced reporting\" on the theory that the Holocaust didn't happen, or the earth is flat. The editor you choose must have the education and the strength of mind to stay based in science and reality.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nPick someone who can understand scientific writing, especially in neuroscience, epidemiology, and genetics, which is where the real work in the etiology of autism takes place.\u00a0 There's a tremendous amount of pseudoscience in the world of autism.\u00a0 Pick someone who can sort out false claims for efficacy of a given treatment.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nYou might also look around the existing on-line world of autism.\u00a0 I'd recommend two sites to start:\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThe Autism Hub \u00a0 http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/  \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Autism Hangout\r\n http://www.autismhangout.com/default.asp \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nPaul Offit 's official website\r\n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nablopomo.com/", "http://whittereronautism.com/2008/11/picky-eaters-and-then-some/", "http://www.change.org/info/about", "http://www.change.org/info/about", "http://tinyurl.com/64ubwx", "http://www.change.org/info/about", "http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-14636-4/autisms-false-prophets", "http://www.routledgementalhealth.com/9780415449809", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/", "http://www.autismhangout.com/default.asp", "http://www.paul-offit.com/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2008/11/advice-to-chang.html", "title": "Advice to Change.org On Hiring an Autism Editor/Blogger"},

{"date": "Friday, January 02, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t 2008\u00a0 was the year of \"Green our Vaccines\" and \"Too Many, Too Soon\" --\u00a0 clever marketing ploys that imply a  lack of safety  in both vaccines and the current CDC-recommended schedule.  \r\n\r\n Unfortunately for public health, these ploys are anti-science. \r\n\r\n One of the physicians who both benefits from these ploys and advances them is Robert W. Sears, M.D, the author of  The Vaccine Book . \r\n\r\n He is a scion of the pediatric marketing juggernaut, the Sears family, who bill themselves as \" America's Family of Pediatricians \". \r\n\r\n \r\n William Sears, M.D., the father, \"Dr. Bill\", who is best known for  attachment parenting. \u00a0 He and his wife and several co-authors have  written a number of popular books. \r\n James M.

Not only does the vaccine-autism theory suggest that autistic children are somehow \"damaged\" and \"injured\" and full of toxic substances---mercury, various \"heavy metals\"---but all the writing and rhetoric about vaccines and autism takes energy and attention away from what is our first task in helping autistic individuals, providing them with high quality education and services throughout their lifespan.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Mainstream Media Responses To Offit/Moser Article \r\n\r\n \r\n Shari Rosen, LA Times, 12/30/08 \r\n Deborah Kotz, US News & World Report, 12/29/08 \r\n Stacy Garfinkle, Washington Post, 12/29/08 \r\n Audrey Greyson, ABC News, 12/29/08 \r\n \r\n Blog Responses to Offit/Moser Article \r\n\r\n \r\n Bryan Vertabedian, M.D.\u00a0 on the Offit article \r\n Bryan Vertabedian, M.D. : APA needs a strategy \r\n Bill Hendrick, WebMD: Alternative Vaccine Schedule Stirs Debate \r\n Paul Wilson, Hawk/Handsaw: Pediatrics Publishes a Critique of an \"Anti-Vaccination\" Book \r\n Mainstream Parenting Resources: Dr. Paul vs. Dr. Bob \r\n Science-Based Parenting: Dr. Offit and Dr. Sears, side by Side \r\n \r\n Esther Ar,  Pediatrician, On Vaccination and Sears' Vaccine Book \r\n\r\n \r\n January 10 2008 Notes from the Israeli Measles Epidemic \r\n September 3, 2008 Have These Parents Been Reading Dr. Bob? \r\n September 5, 2008: Bob Sears' Obsession with Aluminum Demystified Part I \r\n September 7 2008: Bob Sears' Obsession with Aluminum Demystified Part II \r\n September 19 2008: Dr. Bob vs. the MMR \r\n December 31 2008 Dr. Paul vs. Dr. Bob \r\n \r\n\r\n Blog Posts Critical of the \"Green Our Vaccines/Too Many Too Soon\" Ideology \r\n\r\n \r\n David Gorski, M.D. : \"Green Our Vaccines = Anti-Vaccine, Not Vaccine Safety \r\n John Keily: Not Worth the Risk: Thoughts of A Measles Survivor \r\n I Speak of Dreams: Index of Posts on \"Green our Vaccines\" Fallacious Propaganda \r\n I Speak of Dreams: Around the Blogosphere debunking GOV movement \r\n Orac at Respectful Insolence on Jim Sears on the TV show, The Doctors \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n Paul Offit 's official website\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Book-Decision-Parenting-Library/dp/0316017507", "http://www.askdrsears.com/default.asp", "http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/t130100.asp", "http://www.askdrsears.com/store/products.asp?cat=20", "http://www.thedoctorstv.com/DrSears", "http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Book-Decision-Parenting-Library/dp/0316017507/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230743344&sr=1-1", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/123/1/e164", "http://www.askdrsears.com/thevaccinebook/", "http://skepticdad.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/dr-offit-vs-dr-sears-a-copypaste-blow-by-blow/", "http://scienceblogs.com/bookclub/2008/10/thank_you_antivaxxers_and_let.php", "http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/booster_shots/2008/12/pediatrics-grou.html", "http://www.usnews.com/blogs/on-medicine/2008/12/29/flexible-approach-to-vaccinations-comes-under-fire.html#Comments", "http://voices.washingtonpost.com/parenting/2008/12/vaccines.html", "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/ColdandFluNews/story?id=6531763&page=1", "http://parentingsolved.typepad.com/parenting_solved/2008/12/offit-takes-on-the-sears-vaccine-schedule.html", "http://parentingsolved.typepad.com/parenting_solved/2008/12/the-public-evisceration-of-dr-bob-sears-a-sign-of-change.html", "http://children.webmd.com/vaccines/news/20081226/alternative-vaccine-schedule-stirs-debate", "http://hawk-handsaw.blogspot.com/2008/12/pediatrics-publishes-critique-of-anti.html", "http://mainstreamparenting.wordpress.com/2008/12/31/dr-paul-vs-dr-bob/", "http://skepticdad.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/dr-offit-vs-dr-sears-a-copypaste-blow-by-blow/", "http://mainstreamparenting.wordpress.com/about/", "http://mainstreamparenting.wordpress.com/2008/01/10/notes-from-an-epidemic/", "http://mainstreamparenting.wordpress.com/2008/09/03/have-these-parents-have-been-reading-dr-bob/", "http://mainstreamparenting.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/so-whats-the-deal-with-aluminum-in-vaccines-anyway-part-i/", "http://mainstreamparenting.wordpress.com/2008/09/07/so-whats-the-deal-with-aluminum-in-vaccines-anyway-part-ii/", "http://mainstreamparenting.wordpress.com/2008/09/19/dr-bob-vs-the-mmr/", "http://mainstreamparenting.wordpress.com/2008/12/31/dr-paul-vs-dr-bob/", "http://Jenny%20McCarthy,%20Jim%20Carrey,%20and%20%E2%80%9CGreen%20Our%20Vaccines%E2%80%9D:%20Anti-vaccine,%20not%20%E2%80%9Cpro-safe%20vaccine%E2%80%9D", "http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/stories/2008/10/09/kielyed_1009.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/run_dont_walk_from_these_doctors.php", "http://www.paul-offit.com/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/01/the-problem-with-alternative-vaccination-schedules.html", "title": "Alternative Vaccination Schedules Encourage Distrust"},

If you feel a lump, it could be cancer. Early diagnosis can save your life.\" All true. So you find a lump, you go to your doctor, he hems and haws and tells you many women have lumps in their breasts. Go home. The lump grows and gets painful. You go back to the doctor. He says many lumps grow and get painful before they fix themselves. Go home. You feel a lump in your throat and your stomach hurts. He go to the doctor. He diagnoses cancer and then tells you, \"Now go out an create a treatment plan for yourself and you should probably call a funeral home. There's no cure for your cancer. You'll have to pay for much of the treatment you find yourself. See me again in 6-12 months.\" \r\n\r\n Sound familiar? Awareness? Feh.... TACA, GR, NAA, A1, SM, ARI many local autism groups, whether biomed or educational or both are LIGHTYEARS ahead of mere awareness. \r\n\r\n Keep your awareness, we'll provide us action. \r\n\r\n Posted by: Stagmom | December 14, 2008 at 01:43 PM  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a February 2008 article in the Pittsburg Post-Gazette, \r\n\r\n Nancy Minshew, the director of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Excellence in Autism Research, said last week, \"I used to think there were more cases [than in past years], but I don't think so any more.\" She is now convinced that the higher numbers are \"not an increase in the number of cases, but are an improvement in recognition.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n In past decades, she said, it was often hard to get doctors or schools to diagnose higher-functioning children as having autism. They were often labeled as having \"behavior difficulties.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n Dr. Shattuck said other epidemiological studies have shown that the rate of severe autism has stayed steady at about one to two children per 1,000, so that the main part of the increase to an estimated six to seven children per 1,000 has come in the milder, higher-functioning forms of the disorder.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n That points partly to the broader definition being used for what are called Autism Spectrum Disorders today, he said.\r\n\r\n\"When we talk about autism spectrum disorders,\" he said, \"we're talking about kids who have very different symptoms. Some are severely retarded; some have high IQs; some have pathological shyness; others want to have contact but are socially awkward.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n And when people say they don't remember seeing so many autistic children when they were growing up, or ask where all the adults with autism are, there are two possible explanations, Dr. Minshew said.\r\n\r\nOne is that many autistic children in the past were never sent to school. In what she called the \"Forrest Gump era, you didn't even go to school, or you went to a totally separate school.\"\r\n\r\nThe other phenomenon was that some autistic children were labeled as schizophrenic, and many may have ended up in state hospitals or other institutions, she said.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMs. Stagliano's responses?\r\n \r\nTHE SHAMING OF THE MINSHEW\r\n \r\n\r\nI am nauseous reading this article.  \r\n\r\n I have three daughters with autism. No epidemic? Just a genetic blip that happened to hit us?\u00a0\r\n\r\n[snip]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe epidemic deniers are now at the highest echelons of the \"autism experts.\" Meanwhile, they rake in the money from the epidemic that doesn't exist. Disgusting. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n DR. MINSHEW: TODAY'S AUTISM IS YESTERDAY'S SCHIZOPHRENIA \r\n\r\n Does your child, or do you (if you are an adult with autism) appear schizophrenic? Has any doctor or therapist ever uttered the words schizophrenia and autism in the same sentence to you?\r\n\r\nThis declaration of Dr. Minshew's is repulsive and offensive to all people with autism. All people with autism, regardless of what you think of cause or treatment.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a post reporting on the development of vaccines to be delivered by inhalant, Stagliano wrote:\r\n\r\n http://www.buffalo.edu/news/9128\r\n\r\nreports that scientists are working on vaccination via the mucus membranes, in this case, the nose. This application makes sense in outlying areas of the globe, given lack of sanitation, refrigeration and potable water. But having watched enough of Scarface to know that sniffing/snorting/spraying stuff into your nose can affect your brain I have to wonder about the ramifications of snortable vaccines. I'm sure FDA will make sure they are perfectly safe though.\r\n\r\n[snip]\r\n\r\n When they figure out how to put Gardasil onto tampons, I'm leaving the country.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn response to a  profanity-laced post by JB Handley Could I possibly have three children whose \"spontaneous mutation\"  lead to EXACTLY the same diagnosis?????? Puleeeze. And the tooth fairy lives in my mail box. And yet, this is the new \"Company line\" to explain away autism. Sudden, spontaneous mutations affecting 1 in 150 children..... Perhaps I'll achieve a sudden spontaneous mutation soon and finally have the 36C chest I've always wanted? A gal can hope, can't she?

So I hit Jennifer up for more than one interview. Here's the first, continuing the themes that were explored in the \"real world\" post--why can it be so hard to get seemingly simple accommodations from teachers? Is this a problem with individual teachers, with teacher education, with the educational system, with--with what?\r\n \r\n\r\nHere's the beginning of the second interview:\r\n \r\n \r\nThursday I posted Jennifer Parker's take on why it can be difficult for students on the autistic spectrum to get academic accommodations.  Now with more of her attorney hat on, I've asked Jennifer some questions more about the legal and self-advocacy side of academic accommodations at the primary and secondary school leve l.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n Dora: Give me a brief summary of the laws that govern special education and public school accommodations. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n Jennifer:  Section 504 is a civil rights law that allows medical and classroom accommodations for children with disabilities who do not require special education services.

{"date": "Friday, January 02, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t On December 29, the Obama-Biden transition website, Change.gov, announced that the  second round of \"Open for Questions\"  was live.\u00a0 On December 30,\u00a0 the Age of Autism  echo chamber  blog  urged its readers  to advance their anti-vaccination, anti-science agenda on Change.gov. On the same day, Age of Autism  announced  that David Kirby was their Reporter of the Year.\u00a0 The announcer wrote: \r\n I know that for many of us in the autism community, that's an understatement.\u00a0 David should be receiving a lifetime achievement award for what he's done. Now, pay attention.\u00a0  There's another organization, Change.org.\u00a0 I know the names are confusing, but\u00a0 in fact, Change.org pre-dates the Obama campaign's \"Change\" mantra. \r\n \r\nChange.org is a social entrepreneurship venture  based in San Francisco, CA. The company was founded by Ben Rattray in the summer of 2005, and with the support of a friend from Stanford, Mark Dimas, and a founding team of Darren Haas, Rajiv Gupta, and Adam Cheyer, Change.org launched the first version of its site in 2007. \r\n\r\nHere's an important bit:\u00a0  Change.org has no relation to the Obama-Biden transition team or the website Change.gov Back in November, Change.org advertised that it was looking to hire a part-time blogger to manage its autism portal,  http://autism.change.org/\r\n \r\n Previous blogging experience is a plus but not required; we're most interested in someone with passion for autism activism, excellent writing skills, and the drive to lead an online community of like-minded people working for change. \r\n\r\nAs I reported  here , on January 1, Change.org announced who they had hired: Kristina Chew and Dora Raymaker.\u00a0 Both Chew and Raymaker disagree with the Generation Rescue/Age of Autism position that autism is caused by vaccinations, and that autism is \"curable\" by biomedical interventions. In an  article datelined January 2, 2009 , David Kirby takes issue with Chew and Raymaker's approaches to autism, and indicates that he believes that Chew and Raymaker are the \"national autism bloggers.\"\u00a0 In other words, he confuses\u00a0 Change.org with\u00a0 Change.gov.\u00a0 This is a very curious lapse from a professional journalist, let alone a \"Journalist of the Year.\" What follows are some direct quotes from  Kirby's post at Huffington Post .\u00a0 I have taken the precaution of taking screenshots of the whole article, in case of\u00a0 a desire to revise this embarrassing incident out of existence.  \"Recovery from autism is neither possible, nor desirable\" \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nIt's hard to believe that those words would appear anywhere on an official website of the United States Government. But there they are, on the new Autism Blog of President Elect Obama's transition team at www.change.gov.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThey were written by the two women the Obama people hired to head up what could ostensibly be described as the \"National Autism Blog\" - Kristina Chew, who has a son with autism, and Dora Raymaker, an adult on the autism spectrum.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThese women believe that autism is a genetic disorder that children are born with, and is simply part of natural human diversity. They are generally opposed to those who would seek to \"treat\" autism, or try to recover a child from the spectrum.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n......\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nSo, the people who were chosen to run Obama's autism blog don't want to find treatments for autism. They don't believe that autism is epidemic, and don't think there are environmental factors involved in its cause.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nIn fact, they are not particularly interested in even finding out why children have autism in the first place.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\"Focusing on what causes autism diverts attention away from considering issues of pressing concern to actual autistic persons and their families today,\" they wrote, which seems like an odd representation of a man who ran for President on a pro-science agenda.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nEveryone is entitled to their opinion, and to the right to express their opinion. But now, I think, it is time to hear the opinion of the incoming President.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nAnd Age of Autism's Journalist of the Year concludes on a characteristic magisterial note:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nI have written to Change.org and asked them if Mr. Obama shares the view that autism is purely genetic, and that it is not only impossible, but \"undesirable\" to try to recover children from its grips.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nI'd jump on Kirby's misrepresentations and distortions of\u00a0 Chew's approach to autism, but his primary blunder is just too much, all by itself.\u00a0\u00a0 My daddy taught me not to kick a man while he is down. I wonder what the good folks at Age of Autism think now about their Journalist of the Year.

One such student is the son of Kim Miller.\u00a0 The boy's behavior had been deteriorating over the last few weeks, to the point that his psychiatrist was considering hospitalization to stabilize the boy's mental condition.\r\n On Friday, January 30, Ms. Lawson was not at school.\u00a0 The school principal, Lori Link, was dispensing medication in her stead.\u00a0 Ms. Link noticed that Ms. Miller's son's medication capsule was empty.\u00a0 She inspected the other capsules in the boy's medication bottle, and discovered that many had been tampered with. Ms. Miller was summoned to the school. \u00a0 She said,\u00a0\r\n\r\n \r\n \u00a0\r\n\"I felt ill when I got that phone call from the principal. I've known that nurse, I've trusted that nurse for three years. It's a critical situation, it's illegal, it's unethical.\"\r\n \r\n[snip]\r\n \r\n\"This whole thing has made me physically sick. I don't know how long it's been going on. My son wonders if someone is out to get him. He was almost hospitalized unnecessarily because of this. I can't understand why anyone would steal a child's medicine.\"\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nYou have an ill child whose health has been threatened by a school official's behavior. How does the school respond?\r\n \r\n \r\nMs. Miller says, \"To top it all off, I had to sit in the school office for more than two hours on Wednesday after I got the call. Some of the main people from Central Office met behind closed doors all that time, to do damage control I guess. Every once in a while they would walk by me and look at me, and I didn't know what was going on. They finally talked to me after about two and a half hours.\"\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nAlso according to Ms. Miller, a police officer was not summoned to the school until she inquired why the no officers were on the scene.\r\n\r\nThe incident occurred on January 30, 2009. On February 6, the Hamilton County School District issued a statement:\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\"During the course of this investigation, the District learned that Ms. Lawson may also have tampered with student medicine. Hamilton County Department of Education immediately turned this matter over to Red Bank Police Department for further investigation.\"\r\n \r\n \r\nStatements are easy to make. Reality is a bit different.\r\n \r\n \r\nHowever, Red Bank Police Lt. Jay LaMance says a criminal investigation has not yet begun, and his department is awaiting the results of a meeting with school officials before deciding how to proceed.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nMs. Lawson has been suspended without pay.\r\n\r\n Sources:  \r\n \r\n Chattanoogan, October 16, 2007 \u00a0 \r\n Chattanoogan, Feb 6, 2009   \r\n WRCB, February 6, 2009 \u00a0 \r\n Autism at Change.org, February 7, 2009 \r\n \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hcde.org/applications/schooldirectory/SchoolDetail.aspx?FinanceNumber=706", "http://www.hcde.org/site/general_info.aspx", "http://www.cityofredbank.org/", "http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_115308.asp", "http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_115308.asp", "http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_144218.asp", "http://www.wrcbtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=9804353", "http://autism.change.org/blog/view/missing_medication_school_employee_charged"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/02/reason-60578-that-special-education-parents-distrust-schools.html", "title": "Reason #60,578 That Special Education Parents Distrust Schools"},

Otherwise, you would know that the Strategic Plan has not been finalized or voted upon.  You are misleading people, Mr. Kirby.   \r\n That's after  Friday's embarrassing gaffe , in which Kirby can't tell the difference between a private advocacy group and the Obama/Biden transition team. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \r\nHere's the background: The Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee  (IACC) coordinates all efforts within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) concerning autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Through its inclusion of both Federal and public members, the IACC helps to ensure that a wide range of ideas and perspectives are represented and discussed in a public forum.\r\n \r\n\r\nAs  Autism Library explaine d: The NIH has a committee called the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee. Their main goal has been to create a \u201cStrategic Plan\u201d. That\u2019s basically a roadmap for where research should concentrate efforts for the next few years.  As always in strategic planning, it has been a slow and complicated process (see meeting  dates and agendas here ).\u00a0 The last one was December 12, which Kristina Chew covered in part ( agenda  and  report ). Autism Speaks reported The IACC was not able to complete its review of the draft plan and proposed changes during the allotted time provided by federal regulations. It is tentatively scheduled to reconvene in January to complete its work on the introduction and budgetary requirements for the plan and vote on its approval. Mr. Kirby is apparently not part of the reality-based community. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/top-federal-autism-panel_b_155293.html", "http://iacc.hhs.gov/", "http://autismlibrary.org/blog/deadline-today-iacc-strategic-plan-input/", "http://iacc.hhs.gov/events/", "http://www.autismvox.com/iacc-meeting-today-9am-4pm/", "http://www.autismvox.com/1-billion-initiatives-on-autism/", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/inthenews/dec_12_2008_iacc_meeting_recap.php", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/172/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/01/david-kirby-again-two-embarrassing-gaffes-in-three-days-should-his-friends-be-worried.html", "title": "David Kirby Again!

Given that it involved Generation Rescue, Jim Carrey, Jenny McCarthy, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Deirdre Imus and her Deirdre Imus Environmental Center for Pediatric Oncology, the Huffington Post, Age of Autism, and various other antivaccine activists, I thought it pretty obvious that there was a lot of planning and coordination of effort. However, I never expected to find the sort of planning and coordination of effort discovered by Kevin Leitch. It turns out that David Kirby and Peter Bell of  Autism Speaks  have been  coordinating their efforts  to drum up \"respectability\" to the idea that vaccines cause autism.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Kevin discovered this when David Kirby posted an e-mail to his  Evidence of Harm  Yahoo! group. This e-mail happened to include an exchange between him and Peter Bell that led to Kirby writing his  latest HuffPo spinfest  based on an  Autism Speaks interview  with Duane Alexander, M.D., Director of the NICHD. \r\n\r\n Most telling is this exchange, after Bell had forwarded this interview to Kirby: \r\n\r\n Bell:  You just happened to find this on our website, right?

If you want to sign,  go here.  Tell your friends. \r\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\nText of the petition:\r\n \r\n \r\n Ask Michelle Obama to Meet With Autism Families  \r\n\r\n \r\nWe, the undersigned, propose that Michelle Obama meet with Shannon Des Roches Rosa and Jennifer Byde Myers, representatives of the autism community, to discuss effective strategies to provide urgently needed assistance to overstressed autism families.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nWe believe that an Autism Corps, based on the Teach for America model, can create an army of trained volunteers to effect this assistance by providing four to fourteen weekly hours of one-to-one in-home support for people with autism.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nWe believe autism families' immediate need for day-to-day assistance with their autistic family members supersedes discussion of ongoing autism research and causation.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe believe in supporting measures that benefit all autism families.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Sign the petition\r\n \r\n Background \r\n\r\n Target : Those who believe in providing support for ALL families affected by autism.\r\n \r\n\r\n Background  (Preamble):\r\nWe would like to propose that Michelle Obama meet with Shannon Des Roches Rosa and Jennifer Byde Myers, two parents representing two very different autism families' perspectives, to discuss creating an Autism Corps or other measure that will address one of the most pressing needs of families affected by autism: one-to-one in-home support.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThousands of American children and adults have autism diagnoses, and their ranks are swelling. While autism shouldn't be demonized, we need to be frank: having a child with autism is more stress than some families can handle. There often aren't enough trained professionals providing autism services -- and in areas where autism professionals are abundant, many families can't afford their services. Those families have needs that take precedence over panels and promises and research; they need help getting through the day, and they need it now.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nMichelle and Barack Obama have spearheaded a campaign to encourage service. Millions of energetic and idealistic young adults want work but can't find jobs. Our president has said that he \"...believes we must work to guarantee that Americans with ASD [autism spectrum disorder] can live independent and fully productive lives and to assure that their families understand and are able to support a loved one with ASD.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nWe would like to discuss taking those three factors and combining them into a nationwide organization dedicated to training volunteers to aid kids and adults with autism: an Autism Corps, based on the Teach For America urgent action model, to provide autism families in need with between four and fourteen hours of weekly care.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nAutism Corps workers could be trained to help individuals with autism gain skills and independence, and have recreation opportunities. They could give their families some sorely-needed respite. They could make a real difference for families approaching a breaking point. And, like Teach for America alumni, Autism Corps volunteers would have a permanent interest and investment in autism rights and issues, thereby continuing to raise awareness of autism needs in general.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nWe believe that an Autism Corps model is the best way to support all families affected by autism. If you agree, and you think Michelle Obama should meet with Shannon Des Roches Rosa and Jennifer Byde Myers to discuss the matter, then please sign our petition.

A well-timed visit to the bathroom is a cause for major congratulation and a few extra moments of eye contact or an unexpected hug are golden moments. The first time he responded to and delivered back a highfive was glorious.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nDo I regret his autism? Yes, of course. I worry about his ability to cope once we're not around and who will provide any necessary care. As autistic children are often intelligent, they soon realise they are different, and that can lead to great upset. I hope he will turn out to be one of the many autistic adults who learn to cope with society and lead nearnormal lives.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nWould I want him cured? Some parents have said they want their children to remain autistic and, in a way, I can understand why. They are open, honest and vulnerable, and they bring out the best in us. I firmly believe the world would be a better place if everyone had direct experience of an autistic child in the family.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nBut if the question is, would I want him to participate fully in society and have as complete an understanding of the world around him as the rest of us do, the answer is a definite 'Yes'. But if he could retain some of that lovely innocence, that would be a bonus. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n Update March 8, 2010.

But experience shows that counter-scares are likely to be counterproductive. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, May 2003  Immune to the Facts  There have been two phases in the media treatment of the MMR-autism link. In the three years following the appearance of Dr Wakefield\u2019s paper that first suggested the link in February 1998, the issue was largely the preserve of specialist health reporters in the broadsheet newspapers. They reported Dr Wakefield\u2019s case against MMR and the mainstream response in a balanced way. The tone was sceptical towards Dr Wakefield and tended to affirm the benefits of the mass immunisation programme. After January 2001, MMR became a major political issue: Dr Wakefield questioned the safety of the national immunisation campaign, and the integrity of those running it, and the Chief Medical Officer launched a campaign of reassurance. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, December 2003  Hear the Silence  \"Viewers of  Hear the Silence  should know that the pro-MMR experts have refused to participate in the debate because they are outraged that such an utterly groundless scare is being given still more publicity. I would like to make it clear that I have decided to participate in this discussion as a parent of an autistic child and as a GP - not as a specialist in this area.\"> \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatric, December 2003  MMR: Fact and Fiction  On Monday 15 December, Channel 5 is due to screen  Hear the Silence , a drama featuring Juliet Stevenson as the campaigning mother of an autistic child, and Hugh Bonneville as Dr Andrew Wakefield, leading advocate of the link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The drama will be followed by a debate - pre-recorded last week - in which Dr Wakefield and his supporters face critics of the anti-MMR campaign, including myself. Although this debate was boycotted by all the leading experts in the fields of child and public health, immunisation and autism, Evan Harris (Liberal Democrat MP), Gini Bartlett (from the rubella charity Sense) and Tammy Spears (co-author of the Cardiff journalism school study on MMR) helped to ensure that the Wakefield case was not conceded by default....Being the parent of autistic child - as I am - qualifies you to speak authoritatively on the experience of being the parent of an autistic child. It does not give you any privileged insight into the aetiology, epidemiology or any other aspect of the condition. Yet Mrs Kessick and other parents are ready to make public statements on matters that are well beyond their sphere of competence in a way that is likely to undermine public confidence in immunisation policy. As I commented in the studio discussion, the fact that as parents, we have experienced the tragedy of autism in our families, does not give us a license to promote a scare that may have the consequence of visiting similar tragedies on other families. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, December 2003:  Medicine on Trial  The enormous waste of public funds on the abortive MMR litigation is a scandal with a number of dimensions. Before considering the consequences of the collapse of the case, it is worth surveying the legal background and the nature of the scientific research that was carried out under the direction of a team of solicitors. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, February 2004:   MMR: Investigating the Interests   Dr Andrew Wakefield is not the only person with questions to answer following The Sunday  Times \u2019 revelations that he failed to disclose a conflict of interest in his February 1998 Lancet paper that launched the MMR-autism scare. According to a major investigative feature by Brian Deer, in 1996 Dr Wakefield was retained by the solicitor Richard Barr to carry out investigations on a number of children with autism and bowel problems (1). The object of these investigations was to confirm parents\u2019 claims that their children\u2019s behavioural and digestive symptoms had been caused by the MMR vaccine, so that they could claim compensation from the vaccine manufacturers. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, March 2004  MMR: The Controversy Continues  It is true that Dr Wakefield\u2019s career in mainstream medical research has been effectively destroyed by his anti-MMR campaign. But this is more the result of his refusal to follow the rules of scientific research by persistently promoting a hypothesis that neither he nor anybody else has been able to substantiate (at least to the satisfaction of any reputable scientific authority), than the consequence of some arbitrary persecution. It is not the medical establishment that has suppressed debate about MMR, but Dr Wakefield who has avoided it. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, September 2004   Anti-Vaccination Nation?  UK Anti-vaccination campaigns, past and present \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, September 2004   MMR a reparation of sorts  Review of  MMR: Science and Fiction: Exploring the Vaccine Crisis,  Richard Horton, Granta, 2004. \u2018The Wakefield affair reveals a society undone and unable to come to terms with dissent, uncertainty, the meaning of evidence, the inescapable human need for trust, and our wider global responsibilities.\u2019 \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, November 2004  How did the doctor get away with it  Brian Deer\u2019s documentary M MR: What the Doctor Didn\u2019t Tell You  - shown as part of the Dispatches series on the UK\u2019s Channel 4 last night - exposed the sleaze and quackery surrounding the campaign claiming a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Dr Andrew Wakefield, the gastroenterologist who first suggested this link in a now-discredited article in the Lancet in 1998, presents himself as a serious scientist committed to the welfare of children with autism. Yet Deer revealed Dr Wakefield\u2019s commercial interests in discrediting the MMR vaccine (through a patent for a rival vaccine for measles) and the extent of his collaboration with charlatans who exploit vulnerable parents with offers of unproven treatments, even \u2018cures\u2019, for autism. Many viewers will have been shocked to discover the extent of Dr Wakefield\u2019s links with religious fundamentalists and alternative health crackpots in the USA. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, May 2005   Mercury and autism: a dangerous delusion  Review of  Evidence of Harm: Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic: A Medical Controversy , by David Kirby, St Martin\u2019s Press, New York, April 2005. As the parent of an autistic child, and as a doctor distrustful of government and corporate involvement in healthcare, I might be expected to respond positively to this book. If there was convincing evidence that vaccines containing the mercury-based preservative thimerosal cause autism, perhaps I would join those currently applauding David Kirby\u2019s book on his coast-to-coast US promotional tour. But since there is no such evidence, I fear that his misguided endorsement of the anti-mercury cause can only compound the damage that this campaign has already done, both to families affected by autism and, by undermining public confidence in the childhood immunisation programme, to the welfare of children in general. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, November 2005   The death agony of the anti-MMR campaign  A recent Cochrane systematic review concluded that there was \u2018no credible evidence\u2019 of a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and either inflammatory bowel disease or autism (1). The virtually unanimous verdict of the media was that this review, following a series of studies coming to the same conclusion, meant that the scare launched by Andrew Wakefield\u2019s now notorious Lancet paper in 1998 was finally over. Not quite. The publication of the Cochrane review provoked demands that the  Daily Mai l and  Private Eye  acknowledge their past mistakes and apologise for their role in promoting the MMR-autism scare. Instead the  Mail  published a feature by leading columnist Melanie Phillips insisting that claims that MMR was safe were \u2018a load of old baloney\u2019 (2). Phillips proclaimed that, far from having received the \u2018all-clear\u2019, the \u2018MMR scandal\u2019 was \u2018getting worse\u2019. When  Guardian  science writer Ben Goldacre observed that Phillips seemed \u2018to misunderstand basic epidemiology\u2019 (3), she accused him of \u2018smear and evasion\u2019 (4). The hapless  Eye  stumbled between pleading that it had always been pro-immunisation and insisting that Wakefield had been unjustly \u2018completely vilified\u2019 for claiming a link between MMR and autism (though neither he nor anybody else has substantiated this since it was first suggested, nearly 10 years ago) (5) \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, May 2006  MMR is safe -- so why are so many people afraid of it?  Now the notion that MMR causes lingering measles infection in children with autism has been authoritatively refuted. In a study published in the current Journal of Medical Virology, a team led by London-based virologist Muhammad Afzal, and including the Edinburgh autism specialist Anne O\u2019Hare, set out to replicate the methods used by Professor O\u2019Leary (QRT-PCR TaqMan) and also used a more sensitive test (RT-PCR-nested PCR assay) (1). These methods have the potential to detect measles virus RNA transcripts down to single figure copy numbers. Considering it unethical to inflict colonoscopy or lumbar puncture on autistic children for research purposes, the authors used blood specimens taken for other clinical investigations from 15 children who presented sequentially to an autism diagnostic service in the south east of Scotland. The sample included 12 boys and 3 girls; 10 had shown signs of regression in their second year. All had received MMR. The authors could find no measles-virus specific genetic fragments by any method in any case, using assays targeting multiple genomic regions under various experimental formats to improve detection rates. However, they found that all the patients had detectable levels of anti-measles antibodies. They observed that \u2018it therefore seems reasonable to conclude that, after provoking immunity in the vaccine recipients, measles virus was eliminated from the blood by the host defence system, as expected with normal healthy children\u2019. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, June 2006  Stop Witch-hunting Wakefield  The lesson that emerges from the failures of leadership in the medical profession over MMR is that it is not enough to challenge junk science in exclusive conferences and in specialist journals (though that is an indispensable start). When public health is threatened by a researcher who promotes his theories in the mass media before they have been substantiated scientifically, it is vital that these theories are challenged in public as well as in private. It is also important that the invidious character of these methods of evading scientific scrutiny is exposed and the potential dangers pointed out. In short, instead of vindictively pursuing Dr Wakefield, the medical establishment should put its own house in order. While Dr Wakefield has now left the scene, it is only a matter of time before another self-deluded scientist on a mission comes along. \r\n\t Michael Fizpatrick, January 2007  The anti-MMR gravy-train derailed  Two significant developments occurred over the Christmas period in the long-running MMR saga \u2013 both related to the activities of the investigative journalist Brian Deer. .... On 22 December 2006, in response to a request initiated by Deer under the Freedom of Information Act, the Legal Services Commission revealed for the first time details of how more than \u00a315million of legal aid funding was spent by lawyers attempting to make a case that MMR had caused autism in more than 1,000 children (3). This case collapsed in September 2003 when the LSC finally realised that there was no possibility of the case succeeding on the basis of the research commissioned by the lawyers and refused further funding. On 2 January this year, Dr Wakefield announced his withdrawal from the libel action he had launched against Deer and Channel 4 over the \u2018 Dispatches \u2019 programme, agreeing to pay costs of \u00a3500,000 (borne by Dr Wakefield\u2019s medical insurance firm) \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, April 2007   What's behind the autism epidemic?  A review of  Unstrange Minds: Remapping the World of Autism , Roy Richard Grinker, Basic Books, 2007;  Constructing Autism: Unravelling the \u2018Truth\u2019 and Understanding the Social , Majia Holmer Nadesan, Routledge, 2005;  Send in the Idiots: Stories From the Other Side of Autism , Kamran Nazeer, Bloomsbury, 2006. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, July 2007  The Dark Art of the MMR-Autism Panic  Ten years after he launched the MMR-autism scare, Dr Wakefield and his supporters display the formidable PR skills that have provoked and maintained a high level of public disquiet about childhood immunisations. Unfortunately, Dr Wakefield\u2019s scientific achievements lag far behind his successes in media manipulation: after 10 years (and the expenditure of \u00a315million in legal aid funding), he has yet to produce credible evidence that MMR has caused autism in a single child (2). \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, Feburary 2008   The rise and fall of anti-MMR mania  Review of  Health, Risk and News: The MMR Vaccine and the Media, by Tammy Boyce  Dr Boyce asks a number of important questions, notably \u2013 why was media coverage so sympathetic to the campaigners against MMR? Why did those supporting MMR appear relatively ineffectual? \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, October 2008   \"Crusade against autism doing more harm than good\"  The most damaging aspect of the crusade against autism espoused by campaigners such as Kirby, McCarthy and Wright is the attitude it expresses towards children with autism, indeed towards people with autism more broadly. In the article accompanying his London lecture, Wright described the \u2018personal tragedy\u2019, the \u2018emotional burden\u2019, the \u2018devastating\u2019 impact of having an autistic child in the family. Parents who identify with this outlook often describe their own predicament in terms of grief and loss and as one of unremitting battle against the corrosive impact of autism on their child, their marital relationship and on their wider family. This rhetorical excess implicitly disparages and dehumanises people with autism. It is not surprising that such a negative attitude towards autism sometimes seems to lead to a negative attitude towards the autistic child, who is depicted in metaphors of toxicity and disease. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, December 2008   False Prophets in the 'crusade against autism'  Reviews of Aitken's  Dietary Interventions in Autism Spectrum Disorders  Lathe's  Autism, Brain and Environment , Kirk's  Hope for the Autism Spectrum: A Mother and Son Journey of Insight and Biomedical Intervention  The books by Aitken, Lathe and Kirk are given legitimacy by being published by Jessica Kingsley, Britain\u2019s leading publisher of popular autism titles. In all three, authors lacking in relevant qualifications and expertise provide pseudoscientific justifications for treatments not supported by scientific evidence. They encourage parents to implement interventions which are very unlikely to benefit their children, may cause them harm and will certainly impose a heavy burden \u2013 in dashed hopes even more than wasted money \u2013 on the whole family. In striking contrast with the above authors, Paul Offit, author of  Autism\u2019s False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine and the Search for a Cure , is highly qualified to write on theories linking autism to vaccines and the associated \u2018unorthodox biomedical\u2019 treatments. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, February 2009  The MMR scare: From Foolishness to Fraud  From the very start of this scandal, I have worked to debunk the myth of a link between MMR and autism. However, when it emerged nearly three years ago that Dr Wakefield was to be summoned to appear before the GMC on charges of professional misconduct, I argued that this was ill-advised (see Stop witch-hunting Wakefield)... Though I accepted that he had a case to answer in relation to the ethical propriety of conducting invasive investigations (ileo-colonoscopy, lumbar puncture) on autistic children, and in relation to undisclosed legal aid funding, these did not appear to me to justify such punitive proceedings. ... By contrast, Brian Deer\u2019s allegations go the heart of the scientific basis for the claim for a link between MMR and autism, mediated by the hypothesised inflammatory bowel condition subsequently dubbed \u2018autistic enterocolitis\u2019 by Dr Wakefield. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, February 2009  MMR-Autism scare: the truth is out at last  Wakefield\u2019s tragedy is that his incapacity to acknowledge scientific error has led to his professional disgrace. The tragedy for the parents who have followed his campaign is that they have been the last to discover the truth. At least now, thanks to the grand masters of the vaccine court and their excellent expert witnesses, the truth is out. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, February 2009  It is time to stop this 'miracle cure' madness  Biomedical tests and treatments impose a heavy burden on families. One recent US estimate was of an average annual cost equivalent to the median household income ($50,000) (10). Clearly such costs are far beyond the budgets of most British families who do not have private medical insurance (which may well not cover such costs). Yet, as a General Practitioner, I have come across families living on benefits who have spent a substantial proportion of their income on such interventions in the (forlorn) hope that this would help their autistic children. The opportunity costs \u2013 in terms of other expenditures of family resources that are sacrificed to biomedical interventions \u2013 may also be high, affecting siblings and the wider family. \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick April 2009  An Open Letter to [UK Prime Minister] Gordon Brown  In response to her \u2018Dear Gordon\u2019 billboard advertising campaign (see below), you have invited the British autism campaigner Polly Tommey to discuss her campaign with you on Wednesday 15 April. However, in the interests of children and families affected by autism, I hope that you will refuse support for her key activities \u2013 upholding discredited links between vaccines and autism and recommending unproven and untested fringe treatments.  \r\n\t Michael Fitzpatrick, May 2009  Asking questions is not an Inquisition  There is, however, one noise from my experience in the old left that echoes loudly in the current debate. It is the sound of opponents resorting to personal abuse and smears. This was, and is, a sure sign that the other side have just lost the argument and it still puts a spring in one\u2019s step. It is encouraging that, after some equivocation over MMR in the past, the world of autism is moving to distance itself from the unorthodox biomedical approach promoted by Mrs Tommey and her friends. When it became known that three prominent unorthodox biomedical practitioners \u2013 who featured in the recent Bournemouth conference \u2013 had been invited to speak at a mainstream autism conference in London in July, leading autism specialists indicated that they would not share the same platform. The fact that the invitations to all three were briskly withdrawn and the agenda reorganised indicates the refusal of serious scientists and clinicians to give any recognition or legitimacy to the unorthodox biomedical approach. \r\n \r\n\r\nBy the way,  \r\nPaul Offit 's official website\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.co.uk/Defeating-Autism-Damaging-Michael-Fitzpatrick/dp/0415449812/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251910745&sr=1-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Defeating-Autism-Damaging-Michael-Fitzpatrick/dp/0415449812", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415321794/spiked", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415321794/spiked-20", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415235723/spiked", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415235723/spiked-20", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/about/article/193/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/6923/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/5318/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/4436/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/417/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/4422/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2613/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/414/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/411/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2167/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/409/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/408/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/407/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/6756/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/401/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2703/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/3106/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/4462/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/5869/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/5992/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/6194/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/6283/", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/6433/", "", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/6649/", "http://www.paul-offit.com/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/09/index-to-michael-fitzpatricks-autism-articles-at-spiked-------michael-fitzpatrick-november-2002-mumps-campaign-swollen-co.html", "title": "Index to Michael Fitzpatrick's 2002-2009 autism & MMR articles at Spiked!"},
{"date": "Tuesday, September 01, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t On Sunday, August 30, Matt Lauer of Dateline interviewed Andrew Wakefield, Brian Deer, and  Paul Offit , in a program called  Dose of Controversy \r\n\r\n Wakefield is the UK gastroenterologist who was the lead author of a paper published in the Lancet in 1998 that claimed to have measles virus in the intestines of children with autism, and that a new condition, \"autistic enterocolitis\".\u00a0 However, the study could not be replicated, and in 2004, 10 of the 13 authors withdrew from the paper.\u00a0 In 2003, the UK investigative reporter Brian Deer began looking into Wakefield's claims for the Sunday Times.\u00a0 In 2004, Deer published his first report: \" MMR Research Scandal\".\u00a0 \r\n\r\n  Deer's investigations prompted the UK medical board to institute proceedings against Wakefield, including allegations of dishonesty.\u00a0 I believe his medical license is suspended.  \r\n\r\n Wakefield left the UK for the US to become the Executive Director of Thoughtful House in Texas. He does not have a US medical license.  \r\n\r\nMichael Fitzpatrick, November 2004 asked  How did the doctor get away with it  \r\n  Brian Deer\u2019s documentary MMR: What the Doctor Didn\u2019t Tell You - shown as part of the Dispatches series on the UK\u2019s Channel 4 last night - exposed the sleaze and quackery surrounding the campaign claiming a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Dr Andrew Wakefield, the gastroenterologist who first suggested this link in a now-discredited article in the Lancet in 1998, presents himself as a serious scientist committed to the welfare of children with autism. Yet Deer revealed Dr Wakefield\u2019s commercial interests in discrediting the MMR vaccine (through a patent for a rival vaccine for measles) and the extent of his collaboration with charlatans who exploit vulnerable parents with offers of unproven treatments, even \u2018cures\u2019, for autism. Many viewers will have been shocked to discover the extent of Dr Wakefield\u2019s links with religious fundamentalists and alternative health crackpots in the USA.\r\n \r\n \r\nPaul Offit , MD, is Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the Director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Dr. Offit is also the Maurice R. Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology, and a Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. In 2008, he published  Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and Search for a Cure , which is a history of the mistaken notion that something in vaccines is responsible for autism. In an article in the  New York Times ,  \r\n\u201cOpponents of vaccines have taken the autism story hostage,\u201d Dr. Offit said. \u201cThey don\u2019t speak for all parents of autistic kids, they use fringe scientists and celebrities, they\u2019ve set up cottage industries of false hope, and they\u2019re hurting kids. Parents pay out of their pockets for dangerous treatments, they take out second mortgages to buy hyperbaric oxygen chambers.

Open and honest discussions with families using or planning to use chiropractic for their children will, hopefully, bring about a rational use of this treatment in selected musculoskeletal conditions for which there is proof of efficacy, and enable parents to make informed choices about this form of therapy. Further, well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the chiropractic belief that musculoskeletal dysfunctions can be located and treated in children with nonmusculoskeletal conditions 10.

{"date": "Sunday, December 27, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t The Big Pharma Conspiracy (that vaccines somehow cause autism) by Thomas D. Taylor, creator of Midnight in Chicago \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Part I In recent weeks, I have been involved in discussions about whether vaccines cause autism and whether certain treatments for autism are \u201cquack\u201d treatments and therapies.  \r\n\r\n For the record, I do not believe vaccines cause autism, nor do I believe in many of the other conspiracy theories surrounding autism. And I believe a significant number of autism therapies and treatments are indeed \u201cquack\u201d therapies and \u201cquack\u201d treatments.  \r\n\r\n \u201cBig money\u201d and/or \u201dBig Pharma\u201d and/or whoever else is allegedly involved always seem to be the culprit in these conspiracy theories. As if, when a person or company or group of them crosses an arbitrary financial line or exceed a certain profit margin, they have suddenly changed camps or are required to do so by some unspoken law of duplicity. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Part II \r\n \r\n\t\r\n\tThere are PETA activists who are 18 years old college students in debt up to their ears with student loans who have been able to infiltrate slaughter houses and expose the atrocities within via video, or via documentation they\u2019ve managed to get from supposedly secure computer records, but not one person in the vaccines-cause-autism camp has been able to produce a video of a secret meeting where government officials and Big Pharma collude against the public, nor have they produced a document that says that any conspiracy theories are actually in operation. \r\n \r\n\r\n Part III\r\n \r\n\t\r\n\tIt is absurd to think that we supposedly have generations of people going to their graves with undocumented and unverifiable wealth hidden somewhere that has gone unnoticed by the IRS or any other revenue authority in any country.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\t\r\n\tIt is ridiculous to think that all these people would have the knowledge not only to participate in this conspiracy without friends, family members, acquaintances, lovers, et al remaining clueless about what\u2019s going on, as well as to have a working knowledge of all tax laws, the most efficient methods for successful money laundering, and more.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n Part IV \r\n\r\n \r\n\t\r\n\tDo conspiracy theorists mean to suggest with the hundreds of thousands of people involved in all of this, everyone would be able to keep this secret and not tell anyone not in the loop? What possible gain would someone on the lowest level of pay be able to achieve when they could simply break the silence and make millions on a lucrative book deal by telling us all about the alleged conspiracy? Or all book and magazine publishers part of this conspiracy as well?\r\n \r\n\r\n Part V\r\n\r\n \r\n Question:  Identify the profit and/or benefit to doctors when they make the following pronouncement to a parent: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. There is no medically approved treatment available for autism.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Answer:  Zero.  \r\n\r\n Now here is what I find interesting.

{"date": "Sunday, January 03, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t  I heard about this story from Robin Hansen, the  Special Education Examiner \r\n\r\n Zakhqurey Price  is an 11 year old boy with autism who is a student at Beard Elementary in\u00a0Fort Smith School District, Arkansas.\u00a0 In 2008, he spent some time in a residential placement.\u00a0 When he enrolled at Beard, the recommendations for his educational support were not met. \r\n\r\n Specifically, the family requested a full-time aide, a Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) and a Positive Behavior Plan (PBP).\u00a0 None were provided.\u00a0 However, authorities did call the police on numerous occasions. On Oct 30th, Zakhqurey exhibited behaviors manifested by his Autism, which led to restraints. The police were called. In the process of attempting to restrain him, two staff members were injured and filed felony charges against the 11 year old child. They cornered him and tried to take him down, he fought back. There were very minor injuries to principal and teacher. The fifth grader was taken away in handcuffs and booked with juvenile criminals.\u00a0 He has an IQ of 68. \r\n\r\n The family is represented by Zakh's grandmother, Carole Reynolds (go to  Carole's Facebook page )\u00a0 They have not been able to retain an attorney or an advocate, and they lack the funds to continue Zakh's therapies or to attend to his legal issues. \r\n\r\n Other than Robin Hansen's report, I haven't found other verifying reports.\u00a0 School officials or district officials haven't yet commented. \r\n\r\n Anne M. Zachry, who is the CEO of\u00a0 KPS4Parents, Inc (\"Making Special Education Work\") has a blog post  explaining the special education law issues  that arose from the conduct of the Fort Smith school district prior to Zakh's arrest. \r\n\r\n The local television station has a discussion board.\u00a0 Some of the comments are just vile. \r\n\r\n http://community.kfsm.com/service/displayDiscussionThreads.kickAction?as=97523&w=225196&d=337833&ac=new \r\n\r\n Other Supporters: \r\n\r\n Robin Hansen ( Special Education Examiner ) \r\n\r\n Karen Halabura (tweets at  333autismnews ) \r\n\r\n Trisha Kennedy (tweets at  trishinspace ) \r\n\r\n The  Zakh Supporters Facebook Page \r\n\r\n Donation website at The Zakh Appeal ( http://zakhs.blogspot.com/ ) \r\n\r\n Faces of Autism   Update from Trish at the  Autistic Women's Network \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nWell, I had a long conversation with Carole earlier today and I'm in shock at all that has been done to this child and family. They were not given an iep when they requested it and were not given an aide when asked for. They gave the school specific instruction on how to prevent meltdowns and then how to calm him down in case of a meltdown and the school did not follow any of the instruction. They specifically asked the school not to call the police on him, but they did it anyway.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThis is a family trying so hard to keep it together. There are four autistic boys in this family and they are a very loving group with much support from other family members, including Carole, their grandmother. Zakh was taken away over 2 yrs ago and put in an istitution where he was heavily drugged and denied an education or social interaction. When Carole and other family members told medicaid that Zakh was regressing in that environment, they stopped paying his coverage there and was finally released and able to go home.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nDuring his time there though, his 3 yr old sister passed away. He was allowed to go to her funeral, but was sent there in dirty old clothes and was not allowed to mourn with his family. Now he is scared to death because he is facing having to be taken away from his family again as a result of this school's mistreatment of him. No therapy or support has been given to him to help him work through the past two years of his life and the losses he's suffered.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe family is terrified and feeling very much a victim to the system where they live. They fear for the other children as well. They know that what is happening is wrong, but are receiving no support or help from the community that they are in. They wanted to just leave the school system and homeschool, but a judge denied them that right. They tried getting legal help, but were told they would need a $3000 retainer and simply don't have the money.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nWe're in contact with ASAN and hoping that there is something that they can do to help this family.

{"date": "Wednesday, January 06, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\tI told you about  Zakhquery Price on January 3 . Tricia Kennedy, who hosts  Embrace Autism Now  at Blog Talk Radio, had an  interview with Zakh's grandmother on January 5th 2009.  \r\n\r\nThis morning, I received the following action alert\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n \r\nThis is another ASAN Update for bloggers in the Autistic and disability rights communities. ASAN has created an Action Alert regarding the case of an 11-year old Autistic boy in Arkansas named Zakhqurey Price, who has been charged with felony assault after a school restraint incident. There were no serious injuries, and the incident occurred under circumstances where the use of restraint would not have been legal if recently introduced federal civil rights legislation to protect children in schools had been in effect. We are asking that you take action by contacting the school principal and superintendent to inform them of your concerns and by reposting the ASAN Action Alert set forth below.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nAs always, we encourage you to contact us with your comments, and please let us know if you would prefer to receive these announcements at a different address or to be removed from the list.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nBest regards,\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nMeg Evans  \r\nDirector of Community Liaison,Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN)  \r\nemail\u00a0  mmevans@woh.rr.com \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nBy Ari Ne'eman, ASAN President.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nHello,\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nIn the past, we've written to you about advocacy issues relating to the rights of adults and youth on the autism spectrum. Our voices have made a difference on all manner of policy concerns and have sent a clear message that those who seek to deprive Autistic people of any age of their rights will have our community to answer to. Now we'd like to ask you to help us take action to help protect an 11-year old Autistic boy in Arkansas named Zakhqurey Price, currently being charged with felony assault after fighting back when two staff members restrained him in response to behavioral challenges. The school has ignored repeated efforts from Zakh's grandmother over the course of the last five months to obtain needed IEP supports to improve his educational options and manage his behavioral difficulties.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nAccording to the suspension notice, the restraint was in response to Zakh destroying school property - something beyond the scope of what would be allowed under recently introduced federal civil rights legislation around restraint and seclusion in schools. Disability advocates, including ASAN, are fighting to pass this crucial legislation that would broaden the protections available to students like Zakh as well as those with other disabilities and with no disability at all. We have asked for your help in passing this important legislation, and together we can succeed in bringing proposed civil rights protections into law - but not in time to help Zakh. That is why we need you to take action now. Find out how below:\r\n \r\n \r\nSchool Principal: \r\nPam Siebenmorgan (One of the charging parties in Zakh's felony hearing - polite but firm calls and e-mails encouraging her to drop the charges would be helpful)\r\nPhone: 479-646-0834  \r\nE-mail:  psiebenm@fortsmithschools.org   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nSchool Superintendent: \r\nDr. Benny Gooden (The Superintendent runs the entire school district - polite but firm calls and e-mails communicating how this situation is damaging Fort Smith Public Schools' reputation would be helpful as well) \r\nE-mail:  bgooden@fortsmithschools.org \r\nSchool Board Office: 1-479-785-2501 Ext. 1201 \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nWe recommend that you both e-mail and call if you can. If necessary, e-mail is the preferable option. If you would like your e-mails to be passed along to Zakh's grandmother, please bcc: info@autisticadvocacy.org. Please stress the importance of Fort Smith Public Schools taking the following steps:\r\n \r\n \r\n\t Drop the charges against Zakhqurey Price \r\n Work with his grandmother to put in place an IEP that will fulfill Zakh's right for a Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) \r\n Improve training for school personnel to prevent future such incidents and to ensure that students on the autism spectrum as well as with other disabilities are included, supported and educated in Fort Smith Public Schools.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nIf Zakh is declared incompetent as part of the hearing scheduled for January 12th, state law requires that he be placed into a mental hospital for at least 30 days. His grandmother fears that, due to the negative repercussions of being taken out of the community and being forced into an institutional setting, Zakh may lose skills in such an environment and not be returned to her indefinitely.

Many of the blog posts in \"supporting the decision\" list have more accurate summaries\u00a0. For deep detail, readers are directed to  Brian Deer's investigative research  . For another element of the back-story, see David Gorski, blogging at  Science-Based Medicine,  on  Anti-Vaccine Hero Andrew Wakefield: Scientific Fraud \r\n \u00a0 \r\n On January 28, 2010, the body responsible for overseeing physician conduct in the United Kingdom handed down a verdict against Wakefield.The Panel concluded that these findings \r\n \r\n which include those of dishonesty and misleading conduct, would not be insufficient to support a finding of serious professional misconduct.

The commentary was to have been published on Wednesday.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe BMJ commentary said once the study by British surgeon and medical researcher Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues appeared in 1998 in The Lancet, ''the arguments were considered by many to be proven and the ghastly social drama of the demon vaccine took on a life of its own.''\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n I kept a running record of the reactions to the General Medical Council's verdict on Wakefield's conduct at  Andrew Wakefield: Dishonesty, Misleading Conduct, and Serious Professional Misconduct: Blog Posts Critical of Verdict; Blog Posts Approving of Verdict .

For the most part, the major media in the United States aren't interested in that point of view, they won't investigate the causes and possible biomedical treatments of autism independently, and they don't listen to the most important voices \u2013 those of the parents. We will do all those things, and more.\r\n \r\n\r\n Age of Autism has a comment policy.  It reads in part:\r\n \r\n We moderate comments for content. When you fill in the spambot code, your comment will seem to \"disappear.\" Don't worry, we have it. It may take several hours for your comment to appear on the site. [snip] \r\n\r\n We reserve the right to delete any comments sent to us at our discretion. Reasons include, but are not limited to: \r\n \u2022 are abusive, off-topic,\u00a0 or\u00a0 use excessive foul language \u2022 contain racist, sexist, homophobic or other slurs \u2022 are solicitations and/or advertising for personal blogs and websites \u2022 are posted with the explicit intention of provoking other commenters, writers or the staff at Age of Autism \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nAge of Autism has a twitter account.\u00a0 Oddly for a newspaper of record,  they protect their tweets .\u00a0 Recently, they made a twitter announcement:\r\n \r\n We have over 4000 fans on our  Age of Autism FB page . If you ARE a fan please join. We delete trolls, it's not an argument page. FYI. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe fact is, the Age of Autism social media community -- the blog, the twitter account the Facebook page -- is closed to any opinion or statement of fact that disagrees with their party line.\u00a0 It's an echo chamber in there. \r\n\r\n There are deleterious effects to hearing the same message repeated over and over again, without countervailing messages. (sorry -- can't find the links, will try later.) \r\n\r\n There have been some efforts to counter the echo-chamber effect. \r\n\r\n Earlier, Kim Wombles began a blog,  Countering Age of Autism , the announced purposes of which were \"Standing as a direct counter to the misinformation and perpetual gloom that Age of Autism is; Promoting acceptance of and appreciation for people of all neurotypes; Woo-fighting; And some kickass kumbaya when there's a need.\" \r\n\r\n Todd W. (of the  anti- anti-vaccination page ) recently began a new blog,  Silenced by Age of Autism  in response to his frustration over having his comments recently rejected by age of autism.\u00a0 Here's his explanation: \r\n\tRecently, I've tried engaging in dialogue  with some of the folks over at Age of Autism, a blog purporting to be a news source for autism and supporting the autism movement. The bloggers there and commenters frequently cry out about how autism science is being censored (it's not). The curiously hypocritical thing, though, is that they heavily moderate their comments, seldom allowing comments that offer a critical or dissenting opinion.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe purpose of this blog, then, is to provide a forum for people to copy their Age of Autism comments.  \r\n\r\n If you have posted comments at AoA in a respectful manner and have been silenced by their moderators, please copy your post here, including the date and time you posted at AoA. If there is not already a blog post here for the article you commented on, please let me know via the e-mail link in the About Me section to the right, and I will create a new post where you can copy your comment. \r\n\t\r\n\tThe next time someone talks favorably about Age of Autism, point them here so they can see just how much they're missing from the larger picture.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo if you have something to say about a post at Age of Autism, post it there, and keep a text file so you can cross-post it at  Silenced by Age of Autism . On the general subject of comment moderation on an online forum or blog, everyone should study Teresa Nielsen Hayden's  Some things I know about moderating conversations in virtual space:  and Jim McDonald's  Here\u2019s what moderators need to know: \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nAfter studying the articles above, I feel that while Age of Autism is within their rights as blog owners to moderate as heavily as they do, they are missing out on an important aspect of educating the public and advancing their cause. I proudly sport the certificate. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/a-welcome-from-dan-olmste.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/comments-and-submissions.html", "http://twitter.com/AgeofAutism/status/8703868433", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Age-of-Autism/35230968907", "http://counteringageofautism.blogspot.com/", "http://antiantivax.flurf.net/", "http://silencedbyageofautism.blogspot.com/", "http://silencedbyageofautism.blogspot.com/2010/02/age-of-autism-censorship.html", "http://silencedbyageofautism.blogspot.com/", "http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/006036.html", "http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/010445.html#010445"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/02/have-you-ever-had-a-comment-censored-by-age-of-autism-now-theres-an-answer.html", "title": "Have You Ever Had A Comment Moderated Out of Existence By Age of Autism?

The blog  Disability Scoop summarized the report : Thousands of children are secluded or restrained in America\u2019s public\r\nand private schools each year, including hundreds of cases where the\r\ntechniques are allegedly abusive or cause death, according to a report\r\nreleased Tuesday by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n (The complete report can be downloaded by clicking this link:\u00a0  Download D09719t.) \r\n\r\n On December 9, 2009, Rep. George Miller introduced\u00a0 H.R.4247. As introduced, the bill applied to  all  schools, public, private, and homeschools.  \r\n\r\n On February 17, 2010, the Council on American Private Education (CAPE) sent a letter to the House, essentially requesting that private, religious and secular schools, be exempted from the provisions of the bill.  The letter lists several concerns, but to me the central one is this: \r\n\r\n \r\nAnother serious concern we have is that this legislation would impose an unprecedented degree of federal mandates on religious and independent schools.\r\n \r\n (Click here to  .Download 100217_CAPE_letter) \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 23, 2010, a revised version of the bill was submitted.\u00a0 Section 11, Limitations, reads: \r\n\r\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) Applicability- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1) PRIVATE SCHOOLS- Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect any private school that does not receive, or does not serve students who receive, support in any form from any program supported, in whole or in part, with funds appropriated to the Department of Education. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2) HOME SCHOOLS- Nothing in this Act shall be construed to-- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (A) affect a home school, whether or not a home school is treated as a private school or home school under State law; or \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B) consider parents who are schooling a child at home as school personnel. \r\n\r\n On March 1, 2010, The Alliance to Prevent Restraints, Aversive Interventions, and Seclusion (APRAIS)  http://aprais.tash.org/  responded to the CAPE letter\u00a0 with a letter of their own, addressing each of CAPE's expressed concerns.\r\n\r\n \r\n\tPrivate schools have always been covered by, and not exempted from, a wide variety of health and safety regulations, including fire safety rules; building codes; health department regulations on food safety, handling, and cleanliness; and protocols for dealing with outbreaks of infectious disease. The requirements for a minimal level of staff training in crisis prevention and the safe use of potentially dangerous emergency measures as set forth H.R. 4247/S. 2860 are simply another positive contribution to a school\u2019s overall safety and preparedness.\r\n \r\n\r\n (Click here to\u00a0  Download CAPE_letter_response_2-22-10 ) \r\n\r\n\r\n The bill passed March 3, 2010. (Text of bill not yet available in PDF.\u00a0 In the meantime, here's the annotated version from CAPE:  Download HR4247_Miller_CAPE_annotations ). \r\n\r\n I have to say I'm deeply conflicted.\u00a0 On the one hand, I've heard far too many stories of abusive behavior by school personnel toward children with disabilities, and I'm all in favor of national legislation of this nature.\u00a0 On the other hand, I agree with\u00a0 CAPE's worry about federal intrusion into private schools.\u00a0 As the  CAPE press release reads: The bill represents an unprecedented degree of federal control of private schools that threatens their autonomy and puts them between a rock and a hard place:\u00a0 accept the federal intrusion in policies and practices or give up participation in federal programs that benefit students and their teachers.\u00a0 By using even limited involvement in federal programs as the pathway for regulating schools, the bill establishes a dangerous precedent for federal control of private education in the future. \r\n\r\n The blog Disability Scoop has great coverage of the issue of restraint and seclusion:  http://www.disabilityscoop.com/restraint-seclusion/ .

Edited version of my comment: \r\n \r\n \r\nNote: clicking on Judy Converse's name in the comment above takes you to her website,  http://www.nutritioncare.net/index.php  where she is marketing her services and products. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nJudy Converse closes her comment by writing  but I\u2019d rather stick to facts. .\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nHmmmn.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nJudy Converse makes the following claim\r\n GN, are you aware of the much decreased illness, infection, asthma, and autism in the unvaccinated Chicago cohort (>30,000 children)? These children are healthier, get sick much less often,\u00a0 \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n The \"Chicago cohort\" is almost certainly referring to Meyer Eisenstein, M.D.'s practice, which he calls Homefirst.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe claim of\u00a0 \">30,000 unvaccinated children\" originates from a December 7, 2005 article by Dan Olmstead:\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nhttp://www.upi.com/Health_News/2005/12/07/The-Age-of-Autism-A-pretty-big-secret/UPI-68291133982531/\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe problem with Eisenstein's claim is that it has never been validated by any objective evidence. It's just Eisenstein's \"recollections\". It is an extraordinary claim, and as Carl Sagan said, \"because of human fallibility, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nWhat kind of evidence? Well, a start, if lower-level, would be a rigorous and objective chart review from Eisenstein's practice, tabulating vaccination status and presence or absence of asthma, autism, and some other indicators of health.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nWhy hasn't Eisenstein performed such a study to validate his claims? Why hasn't one of the other organizations such as Generation Rescue, Age of Autism, Autism Action Network, or the Autism Research Institute (to name a few) funded such a study?\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nI don't know. Is it possible that they aren't interested in the facts, just opinion? Or that they know a chart review wouldn't substantiate their claims? \r\n\r\n \r\nReaders interested in an investigative report on Meyer Eisenstein and his practice may want to read\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nhttp://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-autism-doctor-eisenstein-may22,0,5564152,full.story  \r\n\r\n Eisenstein's practice has faced at least 19 malpractice cases in the last three decades, and two Homefirst doctors were involved in 15 of those cases -- more than what's typical. In 80 percent of the cases involving those two doctors, a jury either sided with the plaintiffs or the cases were settled, court records show. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nSo I think that claim of Ms. Converse's can be dismissed as just hearsay, not a fact.\u00a0 It's based on a claim from a physician who among other things has misspoken under oath. \r\n\r\n Ms. Converse's second set of claims: Do you not know that children who get Prevnar still get ear infections\r\nand myringotomy tubes, that this vaccine has a >90% failure rate,\r\nand is credited with inviting more virulent pneumococcal strains to\r\ninfect our children? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Prevnar, introduced in 2000,\u00a0 is a vaccine that protects against seven strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae.\u00a0 It's given as a series of four injections ( 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age). \r\n\r\n Ms. Converse implies that Prevnar was developed to prevent ear infections (otitis media).\u00a0 It wasn't. It was developed to prevent serious diseases and death.\u00a0 Prior to the introduction of the vaccine,\u00a0 in children younger than 2 years, infection with streptococcus pneumoniae strains annually caused\u00a0 700 cases of meningitis, 13,000\r\nblood infections,\u00a0 and 200 deaths. (citation:  http://www.immunize.org/printmaterials/dis_pcv7.asp ) \r\n\r\n Ms. Converse is partially correct about Prevnar and otitis media. It has reduced otitis media by 10% and the need for ear tubes (myringotomy) by about 20%. \r\n\r\n The National Network of Immunization Information writes\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nhttp://www.immunizationinfo.org/vaccineInfo/vaccine_detail.cfv?id=9\u00a0 \r\nA full series of the 7-valent conjugate PCV7 vaccine is 97% effective in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the seven types of the pneumococci contained in the vaccine. The vaccine is 89% effective in preventing invasive disease caused by all strains of the pneumococci. The vaccine reduces the incidence of ear infection by about 10% and the need for tubes in the middle ears of children by 20%. Since PCV7 immunization of young children began in the US, there has been a decrease in the number of invasive pneumococcal infections due to the strains in the vaccine (but not to strains that are not in the PCV7 vaccine) in all age groups, including among those who are over the age of 65 years.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Let me repeat: Prevnar has had  striking efficacy in reducing serious illness :  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19947881?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&ordinalpos=6\r\n \r\nDramatic reductions in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) after PCV7 introduction in the United States remain evident 7 years later. IPD rates caused by serotype 19A and other non-PCV7 types have increased but remain low relative to decreases in PCV7-type IPD.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I wonder why Ms. Converse didn't address Prevnar's success in reducing suffering and death? As a parent and a grandparent, I am grateful that Prevnar is available.\u00a0  \r\n\r\n About Ms. Converse's claim that non-vaccinated children are healthier:   because their immune systems have not been overstimulated and riddled with toxins from vaccines.  \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThat't the immune system gambit and the toxins gambit. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nOn the idea that vaccination \"overstimulates the immune system\", for a rebuttal, see the National Network for Immunization Information (NNii)\r\n http://www.immunizationinfo.org/immunization_issues_detail.cfv?id=140\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nAlso see Mark Crislip M.D. at Science-Based Medicine. Dr. Crislip is an infectious disease specialist.\r\n http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=289\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nTo rebut the \"toxins gambit\" see David Gorski M.D. at Science-Based Medicine,  http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9  and  http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=139\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nMs. Converse makes the claim that Prevnar is credited with inviting more virulent pneumococcal strains to infect our children?   \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nAgain, not in accord with the published research. Antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae have been noted, but the research seems to show that standard of antibiotics in \"nonsevere otitis media\" may be the culprit, not routine infant vaccination. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/115/6/1455?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=acute+otitis+&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=10&sortspec=relevance&resourcetype=HWCIT\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19941021?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&ordinalpos=7\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nBottom line: While Judy Converse may be a registered dietician, she seems to have difficulty conforming her opinions with published research.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n Full text of Ms.Converse's comment\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nI am astounded to see the suggestion by \u201cGN MD PhD in Immunology\u201d suggesting parents of unvaccinated children be held liable for infections in other children. Likewise, can parents of vaccine injured kids hold parents of healthy kids responsible? How does one manage to get all those degrees in a human health science, and learn nothing of nutrition vis a vis disease transmission and immune function? \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nGN, are you aware of the much decreased illness, infection, asthma, and autism in the unvaccinated Chicago cohort (>30,000 children)? These children are healthier, get sick much less often, because their immune systems have not been overstimulated and riddled with toxins from vaccines. Do you not know that children who get Prevnar still get ear infections and myringotomy tubes, that this vaccine has a >90% failure rate, and is credited with inviting more virulent pneumococcal strains to infect our children? This is just one of many examples of why vaccines have failed us more than helped at this point.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nNutrition status -not vaccination status - wields enormous power over whether or not a child succumbs to infection. This fact is inexplicably ignored in this debate, and in pediatric practice and training today. Worldwide, over five million children die annually from infections -including measles- that they would have survived or avoided altogether, if they had been in normal nutrition status (see the work of Pelletier PhD from Cornell Univ on this, for starters). There is ample, well pedigreed science on nutritional epidemiology that illustrates how nutrition status and individual nutrients drive robust immune function in children.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nVaccines do not make robust immune function, or strong nutrition status. Food and nutrients do that. Vitamin A alone reduced mortality from infection 23% (view this research at Micronutrient dot Org).\r\n \r\n\r\nElementary tenets of public health nutrition defy much of what is asserted by the pro-vaccine community. So do accepted facts of child nutrition in clinical practice. Turning the debate into zealotry and religion is workable if you want to scare and control people - but I\u2019d rather stick to facts.\r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.albertfuchs.com/", "http://www.jewishjournal.com/nicejewishdoctor/", "http://www.jewishjournal.com/nicejewishdoctor/item/twelve_years_later_the_truth_about_vaccines_and_autism_20100205/#comments", "http://bit.ly/9Lfrjg", "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2005/12/07/The-Age-of-Autism-A-pretty-big-secret/UPI-68291133982531/", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-autism-doctor-eisenstein-may22,0,5564152,full.story", "http://www.immunize.org/printmaterials/dis_pcv7.asp", "http://www.immunizationinfo.org/vaccineInfo/vaccine_detail.cfv?id=9", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19947881?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&ordinalpos=6", "http://www.immunizationinfo.org/immunization_issues_detail.cfv?id=140", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=289", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=139", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/115/6/1455?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=acute+otitis+&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=10&sortspec=relevance&resourcetype=HWCIT", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19941021?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&ordinalpos=7"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/02/on-judy-converses-claims.html", "title": "On Judy Converse's Claims"},

There are even two blogs devoted to the phenomenon:  Countering Age of Autism  (which provides  counterpoint and facts  for the, well, distortions in Age of Autism posts) and  Silenced by Age of Autism , which exists as a place to post comments to Age of Autism posts that are killed by AoA's editors.  \r\n\r\n \r\nJ.B. Handley (an editor at Age of Autism):  commenting at Respectful Insolence ,\u00a0\r\n\r\n \r\nOrac, the reason they screen posts at [Age of Autism] AoA is so that parents of children with autism have a safe environment to talk within. If they wanted debate, they can come to your lovely blog, so we all serve our little purposes, keep up the good work.\r\n \r\n\r\n Interview with Teresa Nielsen Hayden and John Scalzi  on building strong web communities: \r\n \r\n Scalzi : The difference between moderating and controlling is that moderating inclines where controlling dictates. At the end of the day, you are responsible for everything that goes on your site, and sometimes you do need to step in and tell people, \"OK, now you need to stop talking about this,\" or whatever. But when at all possible, what you want is to incline people to a state where they get what they really want to do, which is to have a conversation, and you get what you really want to do, which is to have your site work.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n It seems that one sign of a truly robust online community is that disagreements occur all the time, but they're conducted respectfully.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nScalzi : You don't want to be at a point where what you end up having is only the people who will end up agreeing with you. That's going to get very boring and megalomaniacal. It's much more interesting to have conversations with people who say, \"You know, I like what you write, but your politics are crazy.\" And as long as they can do it politely and have a good time with everybody else, that's perfectly fine. You do have to come in with the idea that you don't mind people telling you you're wrong ... and that's something that's difficult for people to learn. You have to train yourself. You have to moderate yourself as well as the community.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nSome further responses to Mr. Handley's patronizing, infantilizing approach to parents of children with autism and their need for \"safety\"\r\n\r\n \r\nJB: Since I'm the parent of an autistic child, I appreciate your warning that AoA is an echo-chamber where only your opinions are allowed to be heard. I'll stay here on Orac's site, thanks...\r\n\r\n Andrew \r\n \r\n\r\n What are you trying to protect those parents from, JB? The same science and free inquiry that hasn't been done regarding vaccines? What's so unsafe about that? Is that what you mean by \"too many, too soon\" - too many relevant questions asked before your parents are ready for them?\r\n\r\n Posted by: AutismNewsBeat \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nHow incredibly insulting. I'm the parent of two autistic boys, JB, and I certainly don't need the screening of comments to make me feel \"safe.\" What I do need to feel \"safe\" is accurate information, and honest and open discussions, and you know what JB? I feel a thousand times safer here at RI than I do at AoA, even if we do have disagreements here. You never learn anything if you're living in a bubble with other like-minded people, nodding in agreement with one another. Real learning comes from having your ideas challenged every so often.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nYMMV, of course.\r\n \r\n\r\nPosted by:  Jen in TX  \r\n \r\n\r\n As a parent of a child with autism I need to ask, why do parents need to be treated with so much tender care? Parents are too fragile to take differing opinions? I think you, JB are the one who is underestimating the parents, you want your echo chamber to validate yourself, not to protect the parents.

{"date": "Sunday, March 14, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\tThe Poul Thorsen affair:   Left Brain Right Brain has the best coverage \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nA story in the Philadelphia Inquirer today sheds some light on the situation involving Dr. Poul Thorsen.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nBackground for anyone who needs it: Dr. Thorsen is a Danish researcher who is co-author on a number of important studies. These include epidemiological studies on vaccines and autism. Dr. Thorsen did this work at the University of Aarhus, and has since left. There is an investigation ongoing apparently implicating Dr. Thorsen in a possible shortfall of about US$2M from the University.\r\n \r\n\r\nDr. Thorsen\u2019s work was funded largely by the CDC. He started working for Emory University before leaving Aarhus (and this is a point of contention with Aarhus, as they state that Dr. Thorsen was not allowed a joint full-time appointment). He was also listed as adjunct faculty at Drexel University. Dr. Thorsen has also left Emory and his adjunct appointment at Drexel.\r\n \r\n\r\nEmily ( who is knowligeable in this area ) writes:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThese misconduct probes are extremely detailed. They comb over ever millimeter of data, lab books, digital data. If there\u2019s been any kind of compromise of the data, they\u2019ll find it, especially given that completeness and multiplicity of the Danish databases. It would be remarkably difficult to pull off data compromise under those conditions with any expectation of getting away with it while stealing $2 million.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nFrom the sound of the senior authors\u2019 responses to the queries, he was on these papers almost as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d author, probably because of his position in the institute/connections, rather than as someone who did any actual analysis or data gathering. Of course, now everyone\u2019s supposed to swear that any listed author on a paper contributed substantially to the work at hand, so if he didn\u2019t, that\u2019s nefarious, as well\u2026but as we know, everyone does that sort of logrolling. That\u2019s another issue entirely.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nAdd to that Sullivan\u2019s point that these two studies are two of more than 20 have yielded results in agreement: no link.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRobert F. Kennedy jr., who is an attorney, wrote an  article in the Huffington Post  on the Thorsen matter. The \"daily Web newspaper of the autism epidemic\" also published several articles.  \r\n\r\n Orac covers it all at  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: The fine art of distraction from inconvenient facts .

The earlier ruling has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, and this one most likely will be also, but most experts think the court will uphold the decision.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, LB/RB has the best coverage:\r\n\r\n Vaccine Court Decision: thimerosal containing vaccines do not cause autism \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nThe decisions are in for the second phase of the Omnibus Autism Proceedings\u2014the \u201cvaccine court\u201d trials to determine if autism can be considered as a vaccine injury. The first set of decisions were handed down last year (those regarding the MMR as a causative agent). This set explored whether thimerosal, the mercury containing preservative formerly used in childhood vaccines, could cause autism.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe decisions are long, and I expect there to be much discussion. Below are the final paragraphs from the decisions. These are for the three \u201ctest cases\u201d, the hearings held for three specific children who petitioned for compensation on the basis of autism as a vaccine injury. They are clear and decisive: the evidence does not support thimerosal containing vaccines as causing autism, in general or in these three children in specific.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nThe the anti-vaccination movement (or as  PalMD insists ) the \"infectious disease promotion movement\" or IDPM, is not pleased.

{"date": "Monday, March 15, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Many people with autism and other conditions have difficulty in \"social thinking\".\u00a0 As  Michelle Garcia Winer  writes Social thinking is required before the development of social skills. Successful social thinkers consider the points of view, emotions, thoughts, beliefs, prior knowledge and intentions of others (this is often called perspective-taking - considering the perspectives of others). This is for most of us an intuitive process. We can determine the meanings behind the messages communicated by others and how to respond to them within milliseconds to three seconds! Social thinking occurs everywhere, when we talk, share space, walk down the street, even when we read a novel and relate to our pets. It is an intelligence that integrates information across home, work and community settings - something we usually take for granted! In neurotypical (so-called normal-thinking) people, social thinking is hard-wired at birth and learned intuitively from infancy onward. While most of us develop our communication skills as we grow up, steadily observing and acquiring social information and learning how to respond to the people around us, many have great difficulties with this process. These difficulties with learning and applying social information is\u00a0 often considered a social learning disability. \r\n \r\n\r\n Katherine Beals (author of  Raising a Left-Brain Child in a Right Brain World ) writes a post that illustrates how  difficulties with social thinking can affect a child's reading comprehension: \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nBecause of this phenomenon [ social thinking issues ], readings centering on other times, places, and issues tend to be much more accessible to those with autism than readings centering on everyday life. Unfortunately, however, in their zeal to make everything \"relevant\" to students' purported \"personal lives,\" today's educators are biasing their reading selections more and more towards realistic texts about everyday life.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nAny parent who spends any time reading with their autistic child knows about the problems this creates. But too few of those who teach autistic children in school settings--be they regular ed or special ed teachers--have either the training or the experience with one-on-one reading support to have much of an inkling about how autism affects reading comprehension.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nTeachers must therefore be willing to hear suggestions from autism parents about appropriate reading assignments. But are they? I'm still waiting to find out...\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nAnother experienced teacher, Palisadesk,  reflects on teaching reading comprehension to students with autism: \r\n \r\n\t\r\n\tThe issue of teaching reading comprehension to kids with autism is bound up with how to develop their language skills generally, and a lot of generalists like me don\u2019t have a deep knowledge of the relevant research and resources.\r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.socialthinking.com/what-is-social-thinking", "http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Left-Brain-Child-Right-Brain-World/dp/1590306503/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1252432127&sr=8-1", "http://kitchentablemath.blogspot.com/2010/03/autism-and-reading-comprehension.html", "http://kitchentablemath.blogspot.com/2010/03/palisadesk-on-teaching-reading.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/issues-with-language-and-reading-comprehension-autism-edition.html", "title": "Issues with language and reading comprehension: Autism Edition"},

I don\u2018t hesitate to say certain things that are true: That FC has failed every test of science; that it has never once worked under properly controlled conditions; and that facilitator control has been repeatedly shown to be its primary mechanism of operation. These things are the baseline. I believe it is a moral obligation to say that FC is a fundamental human rights violation. Its use not only prevents the person with autism from learning real, functional independent living skills, but it replaces the real person with a fantasy identity of someone else\u2018s making. All that said, we must be exceedingly careful in dealing with the parents and caretakers who have been taken in by these cruel frauds. Smart people can be fooled, and once it happens they are in a trap. They have multiple investments that simply cannot be divested without significant psychological cost. No one wants to admit being taken in by a fraud. No one wants to discover he or she could have done something better for a child.

When you have a whole industry -- books, TV appearances, supplements, merchandise -- and the adulation of religiously devoted followers riding on your theory, the stakes are high. Having to admit you're wrong is intolerable. (How's McCarthy's \"quantum prayer wheel\" working for your kid's autism?) It is much easier to simply reject the truth, which as we know, the vaccine denialists don't care about; it is irrelevant to them.

This school is not just a school, it's a big family and he has done wonderfully.\"\r\n\r\nMelissa and Chris Kalbfleisch, Carter's parents, have been fighting Columbia school leaders since last summer to get the district to allow the service dog at school. The district repeatedly refused, despite a contrary ruling by a Monroe County judge and an upholding of that ruling by the 5th District Appellate Court. Instead, the district sent the boy and his dog to the Illinois Center for Autism.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the school held a Fun Day for its 143 autistic students and 24 autistic adult clients. The day featured games, sprinklers, bounce houses and inflatable slides, swimming pools, snow cones and therapeutic horseback riding for the children.\r\n\r\nStudents attend the school year-round, according to Rachel Newsome, director of development at the center. The year-round attendance helps keep the children from sliding back, behaviorally, during an extended summer break.\r\n\r\n\"The dog is doing great,\" Newsome said. \"We love the challenge with what we do, and this was a window of opportunity for us. The dog has become part of the family, part of the staff. There are six students in Carter's room and there have been noticeable improvements with those students as well as with Carter.\"\r\n\r\nCarter splashed around with friends in a wading pool while Corbin watched him expectantly from his spot in the grass. No children came up to pet Corbin as he laid quietly in the grass among a crowd of students and staff splashing each other with water, running, laughing and playing.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons the school district refused to allow Corbin in the school was the fear that the dog would create havoc in a room full of autistic and special-needs kids.  \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bnd.com/2010/06/25/1307006/autistic-boy-service-dog-fit-in.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/06/a-boy-and-his-dog-after-being-kept-out-of-columbia-school-carter-and-corbin-are-thriving-in-fairview---education---bndcom.html", "title": "A boy and his dog: After being kept out of Columbia school, Carter and Corbin are thriving in Fairview - Education - bnd.com"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 22, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Updated 2/2/13: to add: the author of the attack on Gorski was Jake Crosby, then an undergraduate student.  Mr. Crosby has  recently increased his attacks on folk,  so I wanted to note it here. \r\n David H. Gorski  M.D., Ph.D., FACS is a researcher-surgeon who is working on cures for breast cancer.\u00a0 On his own time, he is also a leading and prolific science blogger, publishing his blog  Respectful Insolence  (where he started pseudonymously, as Orac) and as the managing editor of the group blog  Science-Based Medicine . \r\n On June 14, Gorski published  In which Dr. Gorski once again finds himself a target of the \u201cpharma shill\u201d gambit  at Science-Based Medicine.\u00a0 It is a long and meaty piece, but the gist is a discussion of conflicts of interest in medicine; Dr. Gorski's research relative to a particular drug produced by a pharmaceutical company; and an explanation of\u00a0 real conflicts of interest versus phantom conflicts of interest. \r\n The blog Age of Autism (AoA)\u00a0 is a publication of the anti-vaccination, anti-science organization Generation Rescue and advertises itself as \"the daily web newspaper of the autism epidemic\".\u00a0 Yesterday, AoA\u00a0   published a long, ad-hominem attack  on Dr. Gorski's ethics, based on hazy and fanciful associations and a complete misunderstanding of scientific research. \r\n In the comments ( 1, 2, 3 ), readers were provided with the email addresses of Dr. Gorski's superiors and were urged to send emails to those people, urging them to \"shut down\" Dr. Gorski's online publications, and possibly to suggest that Dr. Gorski should be disciplined or fired by his employer. \r\n This is contemptible.\u00a0  \r\n In defense of Dr. Gorski, I used those same email addresses to send the following to the Board of Governors of the university where Dr. Gorski works. \r\n \r\n \r\nDear Chairman Bernstein, Vice Chair Abbot, and esteemed members of the Board of Governors of Wayne State University,\r\n \r\n \r\nI am writing in regards to the community or public service achievements of David H. Gorski M.D., Ph.D., FACS. \r\n \r\n \r\nI am not a scientist, but an educator of children under the age of 12.\r\n \r\n \r\nI do not know Dr. Gorski personally, but I have been reading his online publications on science, pseudoscience, critical thinking, and medicine for over five years. I regard his online writings, especially those at Science-Based Medicine  (http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/ ) as a tremendous public service not only to me, a lay reader, but to all Americans, especially in regard to cancer treatments and how the science of cancer treatment is evolving, and in critical thinking about science reporting.\r\n \r\n \r\nDr. Gorski is the managing editor of the internet publication Science-Based Medicine; in his biographical page there ( http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?page_id=224 ) he makes clear his connection to Wayne State University; announces any potential conflicts of interest; makes clear that his opinions \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nare most definitely not intended to represent the opinions or positions of Wayne State University School of Medicine, his department, or the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute and should never, ever be construed as such. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nI have learned that an extreme anti-vaccination group, Generation Rescue, today published an article by an undergraduate student attacking Dr. Gorski's integrity. In particular, the post alleged that Dr. Gorski has \"undisclosed financial ties to the vaccine industry.\" The online publication is called Age of Autism. In the comments section, a person I believe to be Age of Autism's managing editor urged readers to write to you and to Dr. Gorski's department chair, with the goal of \"shutting down\" Dr. Gorski's public service activities.\r\n \r\n \r\nInstead, I hope you will commend Dr. Gorski for his extracurricular, public service work in educating the public on pseudoscience and fake cancer \"cures\".\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n====  \r\n Here are the comments posted at Age of Autism.\u00a0 I also have screenshots. \r\n \r\n Comment 1  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nWho is this guy's dept. chair at Wayne State? I wonder if he reads his blog, or better yet, will read THIS. I would think that Wayne State would not appreciate the lines he steps over on a regular basis and would shut him down.\r\n \r\n \r\nPosted by: kim | June 21, 2010 at 08:16 AM \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Comment 2  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nhttp://bog.wayne.edu/members/\r\n \r\n \r\nThis is the Wayne State Board of Governors, names and contact info.\r\n \r\n \r\nPosted by: sos | June 21, 2010 at 09:48 AM\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n comment 3  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nUse sos's links to email the board of the school ASAP. from their website:\r\nThe Wayne State University Board of Governors and 2 of its standing committees will meet on Wednesday, June 23, 2010 in Rooms BC at McGregor Memorial Conference Center, 495 W.

{"date": "Sunday, April 11, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Jenny McCarthy and John Asher 's son Evan was\u00a0 born in May 2002.\u00a0 In the fall of 2004, when he was about 30 months old,\u00a0 Evan suffered a bout of seizures.\u00a0 Subsequently Evan was evaluated for autism at UCLA, and was diagnosed with autism in May of 2005, when he was about 36 months old.\u00a0 Subsequently, according to published reports, he received up to 40 hours a week of behavioral and speech therapy for 12 months or more. \r\n\r\n The speech-language therapy was in part with Sarah Clifford Scheflen. Following the reported success of Evan's treatment with Scheflen,\u00a0 in 2007 McCarthy and Scheflen started a limited liability company,  Teach2Talk , to produce products for parents to use at home, which appears to have been marketed primarily through the internet.  \u00a0Teach2talk\u2019s\u2122 produces educational resources for children which target core speech and language, play and social skills using techniques including video modeling. Our products are created by a practicing speech language pathologist based on her clinical experience and her review of the peer\u2013reviewed research of others, but are designed to be used by parents on their own without outside assistance. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n In an Ocotober 2007 interview with Allison Kugel (when Evan would have been 5 years, 6 months, or eligible for kindergarten), Jenny said He\u2019s classified as typical, but he still has auditory processing issues. I still have him in speech [therapy].  But he\u2019s in typical school and completely normal functioning.  Once in awhile we\u2019ll talk so quickly and there will be so much information, and he\u2019ll go, \u201cWait. Can you slow down?\u201d That\u2019s Evan\u2019s thing though (laughs). He\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re talking too fast!\u201d And that\u2019s auditory processing, where there is too much information together at once. But all of the autism is gone. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n In the fall of 2009, according to an interview in  Cookie Magazine, McCarthy opened a school for\r\nautistic children in L.A.. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n The school's description from its website: Teach2Talk Academy  is an intensive early intervention program for the treatment of preschool aged children from two and a half to six with autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disorders. \r\n\r\n Jenny described the school in an interview with  Bonnie Siegler at the\u00a0 Living Without website: The school, called Teach to Talk Academy, is located in the house where I used to live. I got rid of all my furniture and converted each room into a classroom. We have about 30 kids enrolled between the ages of 3 and 6 years old. The school is an intensive treatment center for autistic kids. We\u2019re basically teaching them how to speak, how to go to the bathroom, how to function, how to look their friends in the eyes. We\u2019re treating autism through nutrition, as well. So I\u2019ll be bringing all my nutritional advice to the school. We have a doctor on board who will come in and do the blood work with the kids and have them on a health regimen. The same diet, the same vitamins, the same detoxing\u2026all the things I\u2019ve done with Evan\u2019s recovery. There\u2019ll also be behavior therapy. I consider these kids in the school right now to be one of the luckiest groups around because we have the very best of the best therapists from UCLA, combined with the best doctors in the world to treat autism. I\u2019ve just put them together under one roof\u2014and there it is!  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n According to several sources, including the KidsLA magazine article quoted below McCarthy's long-term goal was to, with Scheflen, to open a string of schools.  \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n Also, tell us about the Teach2Talk Academy. Why did you start it and what makes it more suitable for kids with autism and other learning disorders?  Teach2Talk Academy opened this year and I'm proud to say is an absolute success in terms of the amount of progress children with autism are making. We have children age 2 to 6 and we use a combination of ABA, floor time and other therapies that help the kids progress according to their specific goals. I also teach parents and guide them toward diet/nutritional tips that can help further their progress while at the school. We also have an after school social skills program for ages 3 to 9. Evan attends social skills and it's his favorite part of the week. They learn how to play freeze tag, teamwork and the importance of making a buddy. (http://t2tacademy.com/)\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n Do you plan on opening more academies, and/or growing it to include older children?  We do have a goal to open more schools around the country. If I had Bill Gates' money I would have them in every state. For now, Sherman Oaks is our home. We do plan on increasing with age in terms of social skills group. But our intensive school is only for ages 2 thru 6.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n It's also important to note that McCarthy's son Evan, who is now 8 1/2 years old, would have aged out of this school or network of schools.\u00a0 (It hasn't been reported where Evan is attending school today, although he may still be homeschooled.) Later in the  KidsLA  article, McCarthy attends social skills classes at the Teach2Talk campus. \r\n\r\n According to the February 25, 2010 interview in  Time  Magazine, the Teach2Talk Academy school was located in the Thousand Oaks house that McCarthy owns. \r\n\r\n According to an April 9, 2010 article in  TV Guide  McCarthy has decided to close the school.\u00a0 It's not clear from the reports if the school will close immediately, or if it will close at the end of the planned school year. \"Jenny and her partner at the Academy, Sarah Scheflen, had different visions for the school and made a decision to go their separate ways,\" McCarthy's rep said in a statement. \"Sarah and Jenny really enjoyed their time working at the Academy and feel honored that they were able to provide such high quality early intervention services to so many children with autism and other developmental disabilities.\" \r\n\r\n It's\u00a0 not clear why McCarthy elected to close the school, or what will happen to the Teach2Talk teaching videos enterprise. \r\n\r\n Unverified gossip posted several places on the web, including Yahoo Shine: \r\n \r\n\tIt was Jenny's pet project \u2014 but, according to a source who knew the couple well, the school's demise may even have been an additional strain that contributed to the end of her five-year relationship with 48-year-old Jim Carrey.  \t\r\n\t\"I don't know who broke up with whom, but I know that for a little bit before the school fell apart Jim was going to possibly buy out Jenny's partner so the school would be all Jenny's. Then, next thing I heard, [Jenny] was moving out [from Carrey's house],\" an insider told us about the couple's April 4 split . \"Jenny McCarthy has had...the worst two months of her life. Her school and her man all vanished in about 60 days.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Given that the school's defined purpose was early intervention for autism, it would have fallen under the  North Los Angeles County Regional Center for Developmental Disabilities.  Some of the children enrolled in Teach2Talk Academy may have been previously served by  California Early Start .\u00a0 Funding for early intervention services for children with autism is  complex and confusing.  \r\n\r\nWhat follows is speculation, not fact:\r\n \r\n\t Ms. McCarthy and Ms. Scheflen may have failed to secure the appropriate permits to run a school or early-intervention program from either the city of Sherman Oaks or the County of Los Angeles  \r\n The business model for the school may have hinged on securing state, county, or school district funding for some of the students or some fraction of the program, which they were unable to obtain \r\n The schoool may have been heavily subsidized by Mr. Carrey, a source of funding that disappeared with the end of the McCarthy-Carrey relationship \r\n Ms. Scheflen may not have endorsed the nutritional /\"detoxing\" aspects of the program \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Sources:\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\t September 20 2007 People Magazine interview \r\n October 09 2007 Press release by Allison Kugel: Jenny McCarthy on Healing Her Son\u2019s Autism and Discovering Her Life\u2019s Mission \r\n May 2009 Shape Magazine article \r\n August 2009 cover article, Cookie Magazine \r\n December / January 2010 issue of Living Without Magazine, Bonnie Siegler Interview with Jenny McCarthy \r\n February 25, 2010 Karl Taro Greenfield: Who is Afraid of Jenny McCarthy \r\n Teach2Talk -- YouTube Channel \r\n KidsLA Magazine (publication date unknown) \r\n April 9 2010 article by Kate Stanhope at TV Guide \r\n April 12 Yahoo Shine article \"Inside Jenny McCarthy's Personal Turmoil\" \r\n California Early Start Program  \r\n California Protection & Advocacy Inc: Early Intervention \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.teach2talk.com/about-us-2.html", "http://www.cookiemag.com/entertainment/2009/08/jenny-mccarthy", "http://t2tacademy.com/", "http://www.livingwithout.com/issues/4_1/autism_jenny_mccarthy-1059-1.html", "http://www.nlacrc.org/eligibility.html", "http://www.dds.ca.gov/earlystart/", "http://www.disabilityrightsca.org/PUBS/505201.htm", "http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20057803,00.html", "http://www.pr.com/article/1076", "http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0846/is_9_28/ai_n31527985/", "http://www.cookiemag.com/entertainment/2009/08/jenny-mccarthy", "http://www.livingwithout.com/issues/4_1/autism_jenny_mccarthy-1059-1.html", "http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1967796-1,00.html", "http://www.youtube.com/user/Teach2Talk", "http://www.kidslamagazine.com/subjects_jenny.html", "http://www.tvguide.com/News/Jenny-McCarthy-School-1017148.aspx?rss=news&partnerid=spi&profileid=05#comments", "http://shine.yahoo.com/channel/parenting/inside-jenny-mccarthys-personal-turmoil-star-closes-school-for-autistic-children-amidst-split-from-jim-carrey-1271964/", "http://www.dds.ca.gov/earlystart/", "http://www.disabilityrightsca.org/PUBS/505201.htm"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/04/jenny-mccarthys-teach-to-talk-enterprises.html", "title": "Jenny McCarthy's Teach to Talk Enterprises"},

One of my earliest memories, from 1956 or 1957, involves translating for Poppy when a plumber came to fix a blocked sink.\u00a0 I was not the most satisfactory mouthpiece -- while I understood what Poppy said, more-or-less, my knowledge of plumbing at age five or six was unsatisfactory.\u00a0 A proud man ,my grandfather's\u00a0 life was profoundly limited for thirty or more years by his speech disorder. \r\n\r\n My father died in 1991, of metastatic melanoma.\u00a0 His speech also became garbled, in the last few months of his life, which was a great frustration to him and to us. \r\n\r\n Today, over the last 18 months, somebody dear to me has developed severe aphasia, as a consequence of a brain injury.\u00a0 For a number of reasons, my dear one isn't a candidate for an augmentative and alternative communication device, but it's quite clear to me, given that relationship, how important communication can be, and how liberating communication devices can be. \r\n\r\n AAC devices used to be referred to as Voice Output Communication Aids (VOCA).\u00a0 At  Teaching Learners With Multiple Special Needs , I ran across this song.  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nNow if that doesn't move you.... \r\n\r\n Many AAC devices are...well, expensive.\u00a0 Currently, a  PRC Vantage Light  is about $7,300.

In 1969, Barrett founded a regional group, the Lehigh Valley Committee Against Health Fraud. In 1996, Barrett and his colleagues began  Quackwatch , an online site publishing articles about  \r\n health-related frauds, myths, fads,\r\n fallacies, and misconduct. . Over time, Quackwatch has grown into a group of related sites, including  Chirowatch  and  Chelationwatch .\u00a0 (The complete list of active sites is at the bottom of this post.) \r\n\r\n Chelationwatch  became a separate site in July of 2004, linking to previously-published articles critical of chelation therapy for anything other than heavy-metal poisoning. \r\n\r\n Chelation is the  accepted medical treatment \u00a0 for a set of rare conditions: heavy-metal poisoning (lead, mercury, and so on).\u00a0 That is the only medically-accepted use for chelation.\u00a0 However,\u00a0 it has been proposed as a questionable therapy for a number of conditions. \r\n\r\n In the\u00a0 1970s,\u00a0 some doctors theorized that chelation might be helpful in heart disease. However, studies showed no benefit and\u00a0  by 1998, chelation was thoroughly discredited as an effective treatment for heart disease. \r\n\r\n Enter novel theories about autism causation and the internet. In 1996, Bernard Rimland of the Autism Research Institute (ARI) published a guide for alternative autism health practioners, which became known as the \"Defeat Autism Now! (DAN!) protocol\".\u00a0 In 2001, Sally Bernard and co-authors published \"Autism: a novel form of mercury poisoning\" in a  fringe medical journal, Medical Hypotheses .\u00a0\r\nWhat's the accepted treatment for mercury poisoning? Why, chelation.\u00a0 \u00a0 In a 2005 position paper, ARI reported: The Autism Research Institute convened our first mercury detoxification Think-Tank in February 2001, in Dallas Texas, in response to the need for information on how best to treat mercury toxicity. The resulting Consensus Report published in May, 2001, has been widely distributed in hard copy and on the Autism Research Institute website. \r\n \r\n\r\n This opened a whole new avenue for \"autism therapy providers\" ( many of whom were not physicians ) to provide \"therapy\" for \"autism as heavy metal poisoning\".\u00a0 Another key word is \"detoxification\".  \r\n\r\n\r\n The hypothesis that autism is a form of mercury poisoning  has been found to be false . Thoroughly and completely false.\u00a0 That didn't stop the chelation enthusiasts.\u00a0  \r\n\r\n A 2008 article by Katie Duzan points out some of the problems ( emphasis added ) \r\n The problem with DAN goes beyond certification.Let's break down the\r\ngeneral protocol for treating a new patient at a DAN office. First,\r\nthey take blood, urine and stool samples. These go to labs for testing\r\nto determine any deficiencies or issues. Sounds legitimate, right?\r\nWell, consider that there are never any children that have their tests\r\ncome back 'normal'. And if anything comes back abnormal, the DAN doctor\r\naggressively treats the problem with medication or other means. Still\r\nsounds okay, but start thinking in terms of reality. What are the odds\r\nthat every single child a DAN doctor sees is in dire need of medical\r\nassistance?  There are parents that truly believe that every single\r\nautistic child has a gut issue, metal toxicity or something else that\r\nneeds to be cleaned, cured or altered. \r\n \r\n Barrett and his colleagues broadened their criticism of chelation to include  chelation as an autism \"treatment \".\u00a0 In the view of\u00a0 responsible physicians, chelation as a treatment for autism is unnecessary and dangerous to the health of the child.\u00a0\u00a0  Chelation rests upon urine tests for \"toxic loads\" of heavy metals.\u00a0 In an article written for  Quackwatch  and republished at  Chelationwatch ,\u00a0 Robert Baratz, M.D., D.D.S., Ph.D. explains \"Dubious Mercury Testing\" ( emphasis added ) Because mercury is ubiquitous, the body reaches a steady state in\r\nwhich tiny amounts are absorbed and excreted. Thus, it is common to\r\nfind mercury in people's urine. Mercury can also be found in the blood,\r\nbecause this is the major medium for transporting materials around the\r\nbody. Large-scale population studies have shown that the general\r\npopulation has urine-mercury levels below 10 micrograms/liter.\r\nIndustrial workers, and dentists, who have regular exposure to mercury\r\nvapor also have low values. Because urine-mercury levels represent the\r\nchronic, steady state, exposure to the body of mercury, they are fairly\r\nreliable indicators of past exposure, since they tend to even out the\r\npeaks and valleys of transient rises and falls in the blood level.\r\nUrine measurements should be performed on the first urine specimen of\r\nthe day, which would be the most concentrated, or (preferably) on a\r\n24-hour urine specimen. \r\n\r\n Urine mercury levels can be artificially raised by administering a\r\nmercury scavenger (chelating agent) such as DMPS or DMSA, which collect\r\nthe small amounts of mercury from the body, concentrate them, and then\r\nforce them to be excreted. In other words, mercury that normally\r\nrecirculates within the body is now bound and excreted. The urine level\r\nunder such circumstances is artificially raised above the steady-state\r\nlevel....  The use of a chelating agent\r\nbefore testing\u2014\"provoked testing\"\u2014should be considered a scam. Anyone\r\ntold that a urine-mercury level produced after taking DMPS represents a\r\ntoxic state is being misled. \r\n \r\n In 2008, Dr. Barrett published an expose of one particular clinic that was using the \"provoked urine heavy metals test\",\u00a0  Be Wary of CARE Clinics and the Center for Autistic Spectrum Disorders (CASD) , in which Barrett observed\r\n\r\n\r\n All patients underwent a provoked \"urine toxic metals test\" in which a urine sample is obtained after the patient receives a chelating agent. The chelating agent temporarily increases the excretion of mercury, lead, and/or other metallic substances that are present in trace amounts within the body. The test report, which typically states that the reported levels are elevated, is then used to claim that the child needs to be \"detoxified\" with chelation therapy  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n In 2009, three decisions from the\u00a0 U.S. Court of Federal Claims (the \"vaccine court\") ruled that there was no reliable evidence linking autism to specific vaccines (MMR)\u00a0 or vaccine ingredients such as thimerosal. \r\n A number of articles followed, pointing out that some physicians and other health-care providers\u00a0 are still using chelation as a \"treatment\" for autism.\u00a0 As Arthur Allen noted in Slate Magazine: \r\n\r\n \r\n ....[A] Chicago laboratory that performs most of the chemical testing for alternative doctors like Bradstreet who treat autistics. Doctor's Data Inc., which tests about 100,000 urine samples for toxic metals each year, presents the results in such a way that it almost guarantees a finding of \"toxicity\" for each child.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nAccording to a recent federal report on complementary medicine, about 72,000 children were chelated in 2007. Most of them were probably seen by doctors loosely allied to an organization called Defeat Autism Now! The doctors, naturopaths, and other practitioners in DAN! frequently order up exhausting regimens of testing for each child in the belief that people with autism are out of whack with nature. They test the children for viruses, bacteria, yeast, immune system elements, and brain antibodies, drawing copious amounts of blood, as well as spinal fluids and biopsy material, before prescribing immune globulins, vitamins, enzymes, and other pills and infusions. The tests and therapies run into the tens of thousands of dollars per child.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nOne of the more popular tests, in recent years, has been for traces of toxic metals. The testing methodology is explained here. In a nutshell, Doctor's Data classifies the level of mercury in the urine of a recently chelated child by comparing it with base-line levels in normal, unchelated children. Naturally, the chelated levels are higher. That's what chelators do: They leach metals out of tissue. Plus, everyone has a little bit of mercury in them, because trace amounts are in our air, water, and food. What's remarkable is that so many people have relied on the data from these tests.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 18, 2009, Stephen Barrett wrote an expose of the urine testing business,  How the \"Urine Toxic Metals\" Test Is Used to Defraud Patients . \u00a0Many patients are falsely told that their body has dangerously high levels of lead, mercury, or other heavy metals and should be \"detoxified\" to reduce these levels. This article explains how a urine test is used to defraud patients. \u00a0 \u00a0 The Bottom Line The urine toxic metals test described above\u2014whether provoked or not\u2014is used to persuade patients they are toxic when they are not. I believe that several agencies can and should do something to stop this deception. \r\n\r\n \r\n If the FDA has jurisdiction over the software used to generate the test reports, it could ban its use. State licensing boards could prohibit the use of provoked testing and discipline practitioners who use it. \r\n State laboratory licensing agencies could prohibit testing of provoked specimens or order Doctor's Data to raise its reference ranges and to stop comparing provoked test results to these non-provoked ranges. \r\n The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Division of Laboratory Services can also ban the testing of provoked specimens. \r\n State attorneys general can seek injunctions based on violations of consumer protection laws. \r\n In addition, all of these agencies can and should issue public warnings. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn July 27, 2009, The American College of Medical Toxicology published a Position Statement \r\n \r\nAmerican College of Medical Toxicology Position Statement on Post-Chelator Challenge Urinary Metal Testing\u00a0 \r\n\r\n It is, therefore, the position of the American College of Medical Toxicology that post-challenge urinary metal testing has not been scientifically validated, has no demonstrated benefit, and may be harmful when applied in the assessment and treatment of patients in whom there is concern for metal poisoning.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n On April 20, 2010, Dr. Barrett published  Doctor's Data Facing Multiple Lawsuits ,\r\n\r\n \r\n\tSeveral networks of fringe practitioners are using hair and urine tests from Doctor's Data to persuade patients to buy dietary supplements and/or undergo \"detoxification\" that they do not need. My advice is very simple. If you encounter a doctor who does either of these things, terminate your relationship, complain to your state licensing board, and  e-mail me an account of what happened.\r\n\t\r\n \u00a0\r\n Evidently,  Doctor's Data  did not appreciate Dr. Barrett's work.\u00a0 He writes: \r\n\r\n On June 18th, Doctor's Data filed suit against me, the National Council Against Health Fraud, Inc., Quackwatch, Inc., and  Consumer Health Digest , accusing us of restraint of trade; trademark dilution; business libel; tortious interference with existing and potential business relationships; fraud or intentional misrepresetation; and violating federal and state laws against deceptive trade practices. (On June 29th,  Consumer Health Digest  was dropped as a defendant.) The complaint asks for more than $10 million in compensatory and punitive damages. The suit objects to seven articles on my Web sites:  \r\n\r\n \r\n  How the Urine Toxic Metals Test Is Used to Defraud Patients \r\n  CARE Clinics, Doctor's Data, Sued for Fraud \r\n  Be Wary of CARE Clinics and the Center for \r\n Autistic Spectrum Disorders (CASD) \r\n  Three brief articles in  Consumer Health Digest :\r\n \r\n  Slate article blasts the urine toxic metals test \r\n  Shady clinic and lab under legal assault \r\n  \"Autism specialists\" sued \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  Laboratories Doing Nonstandard Laboratory Tests \r\n \r\n Provoked testing (administering a chelating agent before collecting a specimen for heavy metals testing) yields unreliable results. This is the prevailing scientific belief and has been the basis for many government actions against practitioners who administered such tests. Like the attorneys' warning letters, their suit objects to my opinion that provoked testing is used to defraud patients, but it fails to challenge my reasoning. Many others have criticized provoked testing, but my analysis may be more conspicuous than the others.  \r\n\r\n The lawsuit also asks the court to muzzle me: \r\n  WHEREFORE, DOCTOR'S DATA, INC., Plaintiff, prays that this court enter an\r\n order granting Doctor's Data a permanent injunction; direct them to remove or delete all disparaging statements and remarks pertaining to Doctor's Data from these or any web sites under their control; and prohibit them from publishing these or any other or additional such remarks on blogs, the aforesaid websites, or any other web sites pending the outcome of this litigation. \r\n The Bottom Line Very few people provide the type of information I do. One reason for this is the fear of being sued. Knowledgeable observers believe that Doctor's Data is trying to intimidate me and perhaps to discourage others from making similar criticisms. However, I have a right to express well-reasoned opinions and will continue to do so.

She\u2019s also a proud member of an often-misunderstood minority-within-a-minority: a woman on the autism spectrum \u2014 or as she prefers to call herself, an \u201cAspergirl.\u201d \r\n \r\n Simone has recently published  Aspergirls:Empowering Females with Asperger Syndrome  (available from  Jessica Kingsley  and  Amazon ). \r\n Steve goes on to write: \r\n \r\n Aspergirls  is partly a personal memoir, and partly a book of  practical advice and support for women on the spectrum and their parents  and friends. Simone has asked a chorus of Aspie women to speak through  its pages, and this personal testimony is deeply moving. Instead of the  bulleted lists of traits and diagnostic criteria that fill many other  books on the subject of autism,  Aspergirls  offers memorable snapshots of autistic lives from the inside. \r\n \r\n Beginning today and continuing until November 10, Steve Silberman will be hosting \r\n a group interview with Simone on the Well , one of the longest-lasting online communities. Most of the Well\u2019s discussions are only open to paying members, but as part of a series of author interviews called Inkwell, my conversation with Simone about  Aspergirls  is readable by anyone on the Web. Interested readers can send their own questions for Simone to  inkwell@well.com . When I get your questions, I\u2019ll post them into the topic so Simone can respond. Indicate clearly if you want to remain anonymous.\r\n \u00a0 \r\n Please join us on the Well . \r\n \r\n\r\nI plan to --  especially on November 1  -- and I hope you will too.  \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2010/10/27/im-right-here-rudy-simone-on-life-as-an-aspergirl/", "http://www.jkp.com/catalogue/book/9781849058261", "http://www.amazon.com/Aspergirls-Empowering-Females-Asperger-Syndrome/dp/1849058261/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1288208307&sr=1-1", "http://www.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/396/Rudy-Simone-Aspergirls-Empowerin-page01.html", "mailto:inkwell@well.com", "http://www.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/396/Rudy-Simone-Aspergirls-Empowerin-page01.html", "http://daisymayfattypants.blogspot.com/2010/10/no-im-not-going-silent-for-autism.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/10/two-weeks-of-interactive-talk-with-rudy-simone-author-of-aspergirls.html", "title": "Two Weeks of Interactive Talk with Rudy Simone, author of Aspergirls"},
{"date": "Sunday, September 19, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Friday September 17, I made a new friend:  Laura Shumaker .\u00a0 Laura's son Matthew is the subject of Laura's memoir  A Regular Guy: Growing Up with Autism  (link to Amazon).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Jennifer Byde Myers ,  Shannon des Roches Rosa  and I met up with Laura at a lovely Greek restaurant in San Francisco,  Kokkari. \u00a0 Part of our conversation was about blogging, and our waiter,  Michael Procopio,  not only told us what to order but had a few thoughts on food blogging. But I digress. \r\n\r\n A Regular Guy  recounts Matthew's story, from a first diagnosis of language delays and Pervasive Developmental Disorder -- Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) when he was just short of three years old, in 1988 or 1989, to his adolescence at a boarding school specializing in children with developmental disabilities, the  Children's Village at Beaver Run. \r\n\r\n The title is beautifully chosen, in a heart-wrenching way. As Matthew matured into adolescence,\u00a0 he had enough language to want to be \"a regular guy\" in the neighborhood, but his cognitive and social skills challenges left him again and again on the outside -- or worse yet, suspended from school or at the attention of law enforcement. \r\n\r\n When Matthew was 15, it became evident that his needs were too great to be met in the local public schools, and his family began exploring residential placement alternatives.\u00a0 There were few, especially given Matthew's impulsive wanderings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In these passages, Shumaker writes about harrowing moments -- Officer Jones' visit following a 911 domestic disturbance call--with grace and restraint. \r\n\r\n Shumaker's chapters\u00a0 on seeking a residential placement for Matthew highlights the difficulties many families affected by autism face: inadequate or inappropriate educational and vocational opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0 The closest place that's a good match for Matthew is over 2,000 miles away from their home in California.\u00a0 The closer programs couldn't meet Matthew's needs. In short, I recommend this book to parents of children newly diagnosed with autism, and for friends and family members. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ------- \r\n\r\n Want to read more of Laura's writing?\u00a0 She has written  \r\n\r\n \r\n Adolescence  and  Moving Day (Transitioning to a Group Home)  for The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism \r\n Dating, With Autism , at Lisa Belkin's  Motherlode  blog in the NY Times \r\n Parenting an Autistic Adult , at Lisa Belkin's  Motherlode  blog in the NY Times \r\n Interview with Laura Shumaker  by Steve Prussack at Autism Talk Radio \r\n She has a  regular column on autism  at the San Francisco Chronicle (SF Gate) \r\n Facebook page for  A Regular Guy \r\n \r\n\r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.laurashumaker.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Regular-Guy-Growing-Autism/dp/098018360X", "http://jennyalice.blogspot.com/", "http://www.squidalicious.com/", "http://www.kokkari.com/home/", "http://michaelprocopio.wordpress.com/", "http://www.camphillspecialschool.org/who_we_are/childrens-village.php", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2010/06/adolescence.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2010/09/moving-day.html", "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/27/dating-with-autism/", "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/", "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/20/parenting-an-autistic-adult/", "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/", "http://autismtalkradio.com/past-shows/0009-autism-talk-radio-growing-up-with-autism-with-laura-schumaker.php", "http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/lshumaker/index", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/A-Regular-Guy-Growing-Up-With-Autism/63614220989"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/09/a-regular-guy-lunch-review.html", "title": "A Regular Guy: Lunch & Review"},

Main post is  Health Consumer Activist Group Subject to Legal Threats -- Send Help \r\n\r\n \r\nDetails: \r\nDoctor's Data, a lab that caters to chelation therapists, has sued Dr. Stephen Barrett. [Barrett S. Why Doctor's Data is trying to muzzle me. Quackwatch, July, 2010].  http://www.quackwatch.org/14Legal/dd_suit.html\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe suit is primarily concerned about Barrett's article, \"How the urine toxic metals test is used to defraud patients,\" which describes how chelationists mislead patients into believing that they need treatment for heavy metal toxicity. [ http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/urine_toxic.html ] \r\n\r\n The heart of the deception is \"provoked\" testing, in which the practitioner administers a chelating agent before the urine specimen is obtained. This artificially raises the levels of lead, mercury, and/or other heavy metals in the urine. The test report states that its \"reference values\" are for non-provoked specimens. However, if a provoked test level exceeds the reference values-which it usually does-it is reported as \"elevated,\" even though it should not be considered significant. Dr. Barrett's article also tabulates disciplinary actions, court decisions, and lawsuits related to provoked testing.  \r\n\r\n Doctor's Data is asking for damages exceeding $10 million and a sweeping injunction against further criticism. Although it is unlikely to prevail, defending against the lawsuit could be costly. Contributions to Barrett's defense fund can be made through the Quackwatch donations page:  http://www.quackwatch.org/00AboutQuackwatch/donations.html\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n Those who support Barrett (updated silently as I find them) \r\n\r\n \r\n June 30 2010 Orac  More Legal Thuggery Against A Defender of Science-Based Medicine   Doctor's Data \r\n June 30 2010\u00a0 Stavros Isaiadis  More Libel Lawsuits instead of Scientific Debate  Journey Through A Burning Mind  Doctor's Data \r\n June 30 2010 Barbara Drescher  Quackwatcher Dr. Steve Barrett Is Under Attack  Woo Fighters  Doctor's Data  and  Doctor's Data \r\n June 30 2010 Monica Pignotti  Science Based Medicine Blog on Legal Thuggery  Potential Harmful and Other Questionable Therapies  Doctor's Data \r\n June 30 2010 Todd W.

You can find the site at  https://communicationshutdown.org/?view=home . \r\n \r\n It's a global initiative to raise much-needed funds for autism groups in over 40 countries. By shutting down social networks for one day on November 1, we hope to encourage a greater understanding of people with autism who find social communication a challenge.  \r\n \r\n I think that the organization's intentions are good, but misguided. \r\n I won't be participating. \r\n I think it perpetuates the stereotype that people with autism \"don't communicate\" or can't speak for themselves. \r\n Others who will be speaking up on November 1.\u00a0 I encourage you to go visit each of these blogs and study their reasons for speaking up. \r\n Update: for those of you who use twitter, there are two hashtags in play: #AutisticsSpeakingDay (for people with autism participating in social media on November 1) and #AutismShoutOut (for autism allies on the day) \r\n Even if you don't use Twitter, you can see what is going on by going to \r\n \r\n http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23AutisticsSpeakingDay \r\n http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23ASDay \r\n Facebook page is  http://www.facebook.com/pages/Autistics-Speaking-Day/162932960394619?ref=mf&v=wall \r\n \r\n There is an allied twitter hashtag, #AutismShoutOut, which you can track at  http://twitter.com/search?q=%23autismshoutout \r\n ( I will be silently adding to this list as I find new posts) \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Corina Becker, a woman with autism,  http://nostereotypeshere.blogspot.com/2010/10/real-communication-shutdown.html \r\n Corina Becker,\u00a0 on the design above\u00a0  http://nostereotypeshere.blogspot.com/2010/10/autistics-speaking-day.html \r\n Emily Willingham, parent of children with autism  http://daisymayfattypants.blogspot.com/2010/10/no-im-not-going-silent-for-autism.html \r\n JHolverstott, autism spectrum specialist,\u00a0  http://jholverstott.wordpress.com/2010/10/15/forget-the-communication-shutdown-heres-how-to-build-awareness/ \r\n Rachel B.

Handley's\u00a0  b\u00eate noire  is anyone who disagrees with the discredited notion that vaccines cause autism; his favorite target for villification is  Paul Offit, MD . \r\n Today, based on an  offhand comment I wrote at Squidalicious , Handley has posted a cloud castle, claiming \"evidence\" that Sullivan is in fact not a father of a child with autism, but Paul Offit's wife Bonnie. \r\n The chain of evidence is pathetic in its delusions.\u00a0 But it's standard operating procedure for those enmeshed in pseudoscience: begin with a misinterpretation, and go hunting frantically (if not hysterically) for confirmation.\u00a0 \r\n Update: Here's Handley's two promises \r\n \r\n If you can produce a dad with a child with autism with a remarkable  grasp of the medical and scientific literature who blogs under the name  Sullivan, a man who has an inordinate grasp of the details of your  husband\u2019s patents, lawsuits, published studies, and web habits,  I will  make sure that the pauloffit.com website is given to you and your  husband for good.

{"date": "Monday, November 01, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t This week is  vaccine awareness week\u00a0  for blogs that are interested in reality- or science-based approaches to health. \r\n As a lay person (that is, not a physician or public health professional) I want to bring my perspective to bear.\u00a0 \r\n I have a number of posts queued up, but I want to start not with the science, but with emotion and memory. \r\n When I started writing online about vaccine issues, and the lack of connection between autism and vaccination, in about 2006,\u00a0 I did so because somebody dear to me was immuno-compromised.\u00a0 I thought if I just explained  the facts,  I'd be persuasive. \r\n My own children are now adults and have children of their own.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm hearing more from young parents and their fears.\u00a0 It is individual parents, one at a time, who make the decision to accept all vaccinations for their children, or none, or some combination.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n And mostly, it seems to me, what motivates parents to avoid some or all vaccinations is fear.\u00a0 \r\n You remember that old game of \"Telephone\", where you whisper a message around a circle?\u00a0\u00a0 The message becomes progressively more garbled.\u00a0 This is what I think is causing parents' fears -- messages originated by professional anti-vaccinationists, like Joe Mercola, Barbara Loe Fisher, Mayer Eisenstein, Suzanne Humphries, Andrew Wakefield, and the like.\u00a0 The professional anti-vaccinationists aren't constrained by truth or reason, and their entire method of operation is to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.\u00a0 They deserve all the scorn and contempt reality-based vaccine advocates can heap upon them. \r\n But the individual parents who hear and believe their messages?\u00a0 Not at all.\u00a0 They need their fears acknowledged and addressed. \r\n Other things on my mind: \r\n I am old enough that I  had  what are now vaccine-preventable diseases.\u00a0 The two I remember most clearly are probably:\u00a0 mumps, during which I rested my head on a chair by my bed and drooled into a basin on the floor, because it hurt too much to swallow; and measles, during which I tried to walk from my bed to the bathroom, and could not, and lost control of both my bladder and bowels.\u00a0 I still remember the shame.\u00a0 Why would I ever subject my children to such suffering if it were safely preventable? \r\n When my daughter was not yet six, somebody very dear to me lost her son, a few months older than my daughter.\u00a0 The boy had a brain stem glioma.\u00a0 From diagnosis to death was less than a year.\u00a0 \r\n I have never given any credit to the vaccine-causation theory of autism, either the discredited Wakefield gut-measles meme, or the \"autism is a unique form of mercury poisoning\" meme.\u00a0 The Wakefield theory all along struck me as footless.\u00a0 The measles vaccine had been given since 1968\u00a0 and the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine had been given since 1971.\u00a0\u00a0 If the measles vaccine was responsible for autism, why wouldn't the increase in incidence have begun in the 1970s?\u00a0 The \"mercury poisoning\" notion struck me as equally without value.\u00a0 \r\n To me,\u00a0 high vaccine uptake rates for infectious diseases are a social justice  issue.  The burden of vaccine-preventable diseases fall  disproportionately upon the poor.\u00a0 \r\n A couple of weeks ago, my blog-pal Lesbian Dad went to  a meditation retreat  lead by the Buddhist nun and teacher,\u00a0  Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n , and came away with some nuggets.\u00a0 Here's the one that resonates with me the most: \r\n \r\n Don\u2019t close your heart or mind to anybody. (Least of all one whose heart or mind you wish to open.) \r\n \r\n Last month I took part in two online debates over vaccination.\u00a0 The first was in the comments section of a post of Shannon Rosa's at the Shot of Prevention blog,  Why My Child With Autism is Fully Vaccinated , and the second was a post at KQED's Quest Community Science Blog,  Health Officials to Consider Tightening Vaccine Exemptions. \u00a0 \r\n So many of the most vociferous anti-vaccine commenters have children, even young adults, with severe behavioral and cognitive challenges.\u00a0 Those commenters blame vaccines for their children's challenges, and they are deeply, deeply angry. \r\n It is so easy, and so foolish, to respond with anger instead of compassion.\u00a0 Yes, they are repeating lies and misinformation about vaccines -- but lies and misinformation fed to them by the professional anti-vaccine forces, those that profit from them.\u00a0 \r\n I'm going to try leading with compassion and the light of truth.\u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/SBM-VaccineAwareness/", "http://www.lesbiandad.net/2010/10/weekend-bonus-shot-monday-edition-10-18-10/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pema_Ch%C3%B6dr%C3%B6n", "http://shotofprevention.com/2010/10/04/why-my-child-with-autism-is-fully-vaccinated/", "http://www.kqed.org/quest/blog/2010/10/13/health-officials-to-consider-tightening-vaccine-exemptions/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/10/-vaxfax-on-vaccine-fears-adverse-reactions-to-vaccines-vaccine-injury-and-parental-beliefs-.html", "title": " #vaxfax On vaccine fears, adverse reactions to vaccines, autism as \"vaccine injury\" and parental beliefs "},

Not so fast, Barbara Loe Fisher and Joe Mercola!,  \r\n Orac issued the following call to action: \r\n \r\n I now request that any and all skeptical bloggers out there also take advantage of Vaccine Awareness Week to do the same... \r\n Joe Mercola and Barbara Loe Fisher want to declare a week \"Vaccine Awareness Week\" in order to bury readers in a deluge of pseudoscience? Surely we can do better than they can and make sure that when anyone Googles \"vaccine awareness,\" what is found is not the current list of anti-vaccine pseudoscience but rather a flood of rational, science-based discussions of vaccines and refutations of the lies of the anti-vaccine movement. What I'd love to see from November 1-6 are a tsunami (word choice intentional) of posts that: \r\n \r\n Include science-based discussions of the safety and efficacy of vaccines \r\n Include science-based refutations of anti-vaccine misinformation \r\n Specifically refute posts by Joe Mercola and Barbara Loe Fisher during that week. (You can throw in Age of Autism, too, if you like.) \r\n \r\n \r\n There have been several indications that there will be one or more aggregators, but it never hurts to have more. \r\n On Twitter, you can follow discussions with the  #vaxfax  tag.\u00a0 If you don't use Twitter, but still want to follow along, you can go to  http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23vaxfax. \r\n Other Aggregations \r\n \r\n Science-Based Medicine Vaccine Awareness Site \r\n \r\n Reliabl e sources of information \r\n \r\n \r\n National Network for Immunization Information (NNii) \r\n Vaccine Safety Institute , Johns Hopkins University \r\n History of Vaccines website \r\n Vaccine Central \r\n antiantivax.flurf.net   \r\n Sense about Science: MMR Vaccine \r\n \r\n Here's the list.

Between 2005 and 2007, she worked both for her own firm, Spectrum Kids LLC, and for private clients.\u00a0 In 2007, she was hired by the  Norwalk, CT school distric t to provide services for preschool children on the autism spectrum. Sometime before October 2008, Norwalk families became concerned about both Lore's billing practices and her\u00a0 treatment methods.\u00a0 The Hour , Norwalk's independent newspaper, seems to have done some old-fashioned newspaper leg-work to uncover the Lore story and to pressure the school district to press charges. As it turned out, Lore lied about her credentials (she only has a high-school equivalency diploma) and was...rather creative with her billing methods. The school district had proof by August of 2008 that Lore wasn't a credentialed behavior analyst, but they continued their contract until the beginning of the criminal investigation in March of 2009.\u00a0 Why? \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n Three Years Later, Lore Arrested \r\n Phony Autism Therapist Arrested \r\n Newly released documents detail Lore's fraud \r\n special ed company snagged in accounting audit \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://portal.norwalkps.org/default.aspx", "http://www.thehour.com/history/", "http://www.yourct.com/new/2010/03/fixing-norwalk-schools-three-years-later-lore-arrested/", "http://www.thedailynorwalk.com/schools/phony-austim-therapist-stacy-lore-arrested-0", "http://www.thedailynorwalk.com/news/newly-released-documents-detail-lores-fraud", "http://www.yourct.com/new/2008/10/special-ed-company-snagged-in-accounting-audit/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/04/reason-85-140-that-parents-of-special-needs-kids-go-ballistic-fraud-edition.html", "title": "Reason #85, 140 that parents of special needs kids go ballistic (Fraud Edition)"},
{"date": "Thursday, November 18, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Updated with new blog posts & requests from bloggers formerly designated as \"anonymous\". So naturally the numbers change as well. \r\n \u00a0  \r\n Yesterday (November 16, 2010), the Age of Autism blog published a  phantasmagoria  by J. B. Handley, asserting that the  blogger known as Sulliva n is in fact Bonnie Offit MD, the wife of  Paul Offit MD . \r\n In that post, Handley wrote: \r\n I\u2019m personally convinced, I think Bonnie Offit is Sullivan. \r\n Today (November 17, 2010), Mr. Handley  posted this comment\u00a0 \r\n \r\n click to embiggen \r\n I'll attend to just the first two sentences: \r\n One of the more enjoyable parts of kicking the hornet's nest is watching the Keyboard Courage Club, aka anonymous bloggers, all get together to defend one of their own. It's a society of chicken-shits. \r\n Two points: \r\n \r\n Is  anonymous  the same as  pseudonymous? \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n How many of the bloggers who challenged Mr. Handly's phantasmagoria are in fact -- well, not blogging using their legal names?  \r\n \r\n I'm going to tackle the second point first, and leave the first for another post.  Let's look at the evidence to date: \r\n As of November 17, 2010, at 6:39 Pacific Standard Time (PST)  November 18 at 8:05 pm  there are  eighteen  twenty responses to Mr. Handley's assertions: \r\n Posts: \r\n \r\n Liz Ditz at I Speak of Dreams So Wrong It Is Funny:  \r\n Orac at Respectful Insolence  I am Bonnie Offit \r\n Kev at LeftBrain/RightBrain  I am Bonnie Offit \r\n Kim Wombles at Countering  No No No  I  am Bonnie Offit \r\n Kim Wombles at Countering  It Has to Be Asked \r\n Kim Wombles at Countering  Age of Autism Runs Out of Steam: Handley, Bonnie Offit, and Sullivan from LBRB \r\n Catherina at JusttheVax  I am Bonnie Offit \r\n Science Mom at JusttheVax  I'm Really Bonnie Offit \r\n Todd W at Silenced by Age of Autism  I am Bonnie Offit! \r\n Laura at Life at The House That Asperger's built  I am Bonnie Offit \r\n Emily Willingham at A Life Less Ordinary  Age of Autism, Meet Shark \r\n Rene F.

What about the other  eight?  eleven? \r\n \r\n Orac at Respectful Insolence  I am Bonnie Offit \r\n \r\n Orac's relationship to David Gorski, MD is well-known.\u00a0 In fact, at the blog Age of Autism Mr. Handley himself  made a big deal out of their relationship,  as did Jake Crosby at the same site in  an effort to threaten Dr. Gorski's employmen t. \r\n So we are up to  10/18 = 55.55%.\u00a0  10/20=50% Progress!  Even closer to busted. \r\n Next: \r\n \r\n Kev at LeftBrain/RightBrain  I am Bonnie Offit \r\n Kev\u00a0 at LeftBrain RightBrain  Society vs. Individuals \r\n \r\n Who is Kev? He is Kevin Leitch;\u00a0 his real-life identity is well-known to the folk at Age of Autism,  as this scurrilous post reveals . \r\n So we are up to  12/18 = 66.66%.\u00a0  12/20=60%   Even closer to busted.  Creeping up on busted! \r\n Who is left?\u00a0 Are they truly anonymous? \r\n \r\n Catherina at JusttheVax  I am Bonnie Offit \r\n Science Mom at JusttheVax  I'm Really Bonnie Offit \r\n Todd W at Silenced by Age of Autism  I am Bonnie Offit! \r\n Laura at Life at The House That Asperger's built  I am Bonnie Offit \r\n Travis at the Pretend Biologist  I am Bonnie Offit \r\n Sheldon at Vaccines Work  He Who Pays the Piper--I am Bonnie Offit \r\n Todd W at Silenced by Age of Autism  I am Bonnie Offit -- Followup \r\n MJ at Autism Jabberwocky  When Age of Autism Attacks \r\n \r\n Are these people  anonymous  or  pseudonymous?\u00a0  Let's take them on a case-by-case basis. \r\n \r\n Catherina at JusttheVax -- she and her blogging partner, ScienceMom, were long-time commenters at sites such as Respectful Insolence.\u00a0  They began their blogging career in April, 2009 \u00a0  \r\n Science Mom at JusttheVax  I'm Really Bonnie Offit  They have an email address,  justthevax@gmail.com , to which they respond [personal evidence]  \r\n \r\n My call?\u00a0 Pseudonymous, and therefore the count is up to 14/20 = 70%.\u00a0 Even closer to busted. \r\n \r\n Todd W. is a long-time commenter at sites such as Bad Astronomy. \u00a0\u00a0 He has a website,  The Truth About the Evils of Vaccination  and a blog,  Silenced by Age of Autism  , to track comments that were moderated out of existence at the Age of Autism site, and  an email address to which he responds . [personal evidence] \r\n \r\n My call?\u00a0 Pseudonymous, and therefore the count is up to 16/20 = 80%.\u00a0 Even closer to busted. \r\n Next: \r\n \r\n Sheldon at Vaccines Work  He Who Pays the Piper--I am Bonnie Offit \r\n \r\n Sheldon is a long-time commenter at the Huffington Post (as Sheldon101), and other sites.\u00a0 In October 2009 he started a blog to curate his comments, some of which were, well, moderated out of existence. (Is there a pattern here?) He has a  revealing about page , including  an email address  to which he replies [personal evidence] \r\n My call?\u00a0 Pseudonymous, and therefore the count is up to 17/20 = 85%.\u00a0 Even closer to busted. \r\n Although I don't know MJ myself, I know people who know him in real life and vouch for his identity. \r\n \r\n MJ at Autism Jabberwocky  When Age of Autism Attacks \r\n \r\n My call?\u00a0 Pseudonymous, and therefore the count is up to 18/20 = 90%.\u00a0 Even closer to busted. \r\n  \r\n \r\n Laura at Life at The House That Asperger's Built \r\n \r\n Laura has an  informative about page , but no contact information. I'm putting her in the \"anonymous\" category. \r\n \r\n Travis at the Pretend Biologist  I am Bonnie Offit \r\n \r\n Travis also has an  informative about page  but not contact information.  For that reason I am also putting him  in the \"anonymous\" category. \r\n \r\n Both Laura and Travis have left comments that indicate they don't think of themselves as \"anonymous\" so I'm adding them to a new category: blogs under a partial version of real name: \r\n \r\n Laura at Life at The House That Asperger's built  I am Bonnie Offit \r\n Travis at the Pretend Biologist  I am Bonnie Offit \r\n \r\n Final count?\u00a0 20/20 = 100%\u00a0 \r\n That is strong enough to call \r\n Mr. Handley's assertion is totally and completely busted. \r\n   \r\n Oh, and about Mr. Handley's comment that \r\n \r\n ...anonymous bloggers, It's a society of chicken-shits. \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n Well, Mr. Handley, how about  your  anonymous (and vulgar) comments? \r\n These are his most recent\u00a0

Martin, MD\r\n\r\nMay 5, 2010 -- The use of gluten-free and casein-free diets to treat autism is increasingly popular among families, but researchers who reviewed 14 published studies on the diets say science does not back them up as useful.\r\n\r\n\"The evidence that has been collected does not support the use of the diets as a treatment for autism,\" study researcher Austin Mulloy, a doctoral student at the University of Texas at Austin, tells WebMD.\r\n\r\n\"A number of studies have been done and they are all inconclusive about the diets' effectiveness,\" he says. The review is published in the summer edition of Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders.\r\n\r\nAbout one in 110 children in the U.S. has autism spectrum disorder, a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that include autism as well as Asperger's syndrome and other forms that involve difficulties in social relationships and communication. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20100505/can-special-diets-treat-autism"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/05/can-special-diets-treat-autism.html", "title": "Can Special Diets Treat Autism?"},
{"date": "Saturday, December 04, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t (a\u00a0 version of this post is cross-posted at  Academic Remediation )  \r\n See updated discussion at the bottom of the post \r\n Years ago, Daniel Dage published  The Fleecing of the Autism Community,  on all the ways people sell \"cures\" and \"treatments\" to parents of children with autism. \r\n From a commenter  on a forum discussing Brain Balance: \r\n \r\n There's also a burden-of-proof issue here. Proposed therapies basically  need to be assumed ineffective until proven otherwise. The fact that  this therapy has not managed to generate a shred of research in its  favor is a very bad sign. \r\n \r\n There's a new wrinkle: a chiropractor is marketing franchises to sell his \"treatment\", called \"Brain Balance\".\u00a0\u00a0 It isn't cheap ( this is from an Atlanta, Georgia-area seminar, and was posted September 21st, 2010 ) \r\n \r\n $450 for your child's Brain Balance assessment (Brain Balances's confusing way to say your child needs help and to justify their specific program/vitamins for your child) \r\n For $7,000:             \r\n \r\n 24 1-hour sessions over 6 weeks, at 3 sessions per week.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n Blood/Urine analysis that will determine which franchise vitamin  supplements your child will need to \"succeed\".  \r\n \r\n \r\n Additional supplements as indicated by the tests above. These supplements can  only be purchased while enrolled in this franchise. \r\n \r\n As more than one commenter said in the forum linked above, if it works, $7,000 is cheap. However: The Brain Balance scheme has no research base, is founded on misunderstandings about brain development, is extremely expensive, and is unlikely to help your child.. \r\n \r\n The Brain Balance Program\u00ae  is an individualized and comprehensive approach to helping children with neurobehavioral and learning difficulties surmount their unique challenges. This proprietary, non-medical program has been successful in helping hundreds of children reach their physical, social/behavioral health and academic potential. We work with children who suffer with ADD/ADHD, Dyslexia, Tourette\u2019s, Asperger\u2019s and Autism Spectrum Disorders. \r\n \r\n First point: despite claims and testamonials on the Brain Balance website, there is no published evidence that the Brain Balance program does anything other than lighten your wallet.\u00a0 There have been no peer-reviewed, randomized controlled trials (RCTs)\u00a0 for the Brain Balance program.\u00a0\u00a0 In this article\u00a0  Dorothy Bishop explains why RCTs are necessary to evaluate psychological and/or\u00a0 educational interventions. \r\n Second point:\u00a0 while the explanations from Brain Balance sound \"sciencey\",\u00a0 they are almost entirely psuedoscience: \r\n Harriet Hall MD wrote: \r\n \r\n [The Brain Balance website claims]\u00a0 that ADHD, autism, Tourette\u2019s syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder and dyslexia are no longer considered separate entities but are now considered points on a spectrum of neurobehavioral / developmental disorders. This is their own idiosyncratic interpretation and it directly contradicts the understanding of mainstream science. \r\n \r\n Emily Willingham wrote: \r\n \r\n One of the cardinal signs of a pseudoscience is the promise to ameliorate unrelated problems with a single, curative method...that is proprietary . \r\n \r\n Steven Novella MD wrote \r\n \r\n the brain balance paradigm wants to roll back the clock of our understanding about half a century ....\u00a0 To argue that a broad range of neurological disorders all come down to one narrow subtype of one type of brain dysfunction is pseudoscience \u2013 it is good for marketing your one therapy, but not for actually helping people or understanding neuroscience. \r\n \r\n Mina Dulcan MD on the foundational idea behind Brain Balance: \r\n \"The notion that one half of the brain developed faster than the other just doesn't fit with anything we know about the brain\" \r\n Third point: it's a turn-key franchise business.\u00a0 \r\n click on image for full size \r\n That's right, the owner of the Brain Balance enterprise in your town may have no expertise in education, or treatment of ADHD, learning disabilities such as dyslexia, or neurological conditions such as Tourette's or autism.\u00a0 \r\n Here's a portion of the sales pitch for prospective Brain Balance franchisees: \r\n \r\n Description: Brain Balance\u2122 Achievement Centers. Where every kid connects with success. Some people say that parents of children with developmental and learning disorders can only expect so much from their child. We disagree. Opportunities: Franchises available throughout the US. Business Type: Franchise. Minimum Investment: $188,900. Training Provided: Yes. SBA-Approved: Yes. At each Brain Balance\u2122 Achievement Center, you will be trained to employ our exclusive Brain Balance Program\u00ae. The Brain Balance Program\u00ae is an individualized, comprehensive program that integrates physical and cognitive exercises, with easy-to-follow dietary changes. The Brain Balance Program\u00ae integrates physical activities (sensory-based stimulation and motor exercises) with effective educational and behavioral methods, as well as supportive nutritional initiatives, in order to promote optimum brain and body function. The Brain Balance Program\u00ae does not rely on pharmaceutical drugs, medical procedures, or psychotherapy. Our program is an integrated approach \u2013 one that is designed to help children who suffer from a range of neurobehavioral disorders. What Brain Balance\u2122 Achievement Centers offer \r\n \r\n \u00a0Use of our proprietary software that will allow you, as a franchisee, to oversee and manage your center from anywhere in the world, at any time. It also allows you to handle all the daily center student program activities and provide frequent reports to parents in real time. \r\n Training and consulting by Dr. Robert Melillo and his staff. Dr. Robert Melillo is the founder of the Brain Balance Program\u00ae and is an internationally known brain researcher, professor, author and functional neurologist.\u00a0  Note that \"Dr\" Melillo is actually a chiropractor, not a physician.  \r\n High level of training and use of our effective, innovative training platform \r\n Support from our corporate staff, which has many years experience in franchise development, center business applications and school education. \r\n \r\n \r\n Do you really want a cookie-cutter, ineffective, expensive \"treatment\" for your child, administered by persons of unknown (if any) training,paid $12-18 per hour?\u00a0  The image below is an ad for a \"Sensory Motor Coach\" for the Denver Brain Balance, retrieved 12/4/2010 from  http://denver.craigslist.org/edu/2049522111.html \r\n \r\n Further Reading: \r\n \r\n Emily Willingham, PhD at a Life Less Ordinary  Brain Balance: A Critique \r\n Steven Novella, MD at Neurologica  Brain Balance \r\n Harriet Hall, MD at Science-Based Medicine  Brain Balance \r\n Jim Roche, PhD at AutismBC  Brain Balance not so Balanced \r\n Margaret V.

He was fantastic and had answers to everything. But in the end what we took away from Brain Balance was a sense of disappointment at what could have been. If the program had been regulated and monitored in a professional manner, we might have seen some success without medication for ADHD. \r\n I have heard many different opinions about Brain Balance. We attended the one in Peachtree Center. One of our acquaintances has a child with HFA and the elimination diet alone has helped them tremendously. Although we tried this, it did not help our situation. Our child is now seen a reputable trained psychiatrist and is prescribed medication. \r\n At the end of our 12 weeks, BB said 'oh, we've made progress but not enough...but if you give us another 3K (on top of the 5K we paid for 12 weeks) we will be excited to work with your child for another 12 weeks. \r\n Even after explaining how outrageous their request was, no one ever contacted us from BB to discuss nor empathize with our disappointment. \r\n About a year after (this January), we did receive a letter. It was to tell us there were new vitamin/amino acids we could purchase...as if the $500 for that wasn't enough. \r\n I wouldn't have cared on the amount of money we spent on trying to find a non-medication based therapy for our child. I do care that they only saw our family, our child, as a profit margin. \r\n \r\n http://www.city-data.com/forum/atlanta/408686-brain-balance-my-add-child-5.html \r\n \r\n 10-19-2009; boys007 \r\n Brain Balance did not help our child!!!!! Save your $6000 and go to a good psychologist! They often stimulate the wrong side of the brain and really only help a handful of kids. \r\n Ask them what happens if you aren't satisfied? They only offered us more sessions for another $6000!! \r\n \r\n http://www.city-data.com/forum/atlanta/408686-brain-balance-my-add-child-6.html \r\n \r\n \u00a0 05-17-2010,E&NM \r\n There is no evidence of long term gains from such a program. Brain Balance has employed an amazing NY PR firm to sell their product. This program promises to cure disorders that have no known cure by packaging bits and pieces of interventions as a cure. Use the $6,000 and hire a great tutor to incrementally help a child with skill development OR put it towards a private school that can support your child's needs. Most of the CAMs fall in this category. \r\n \r\n http://www.city-data.com/forum/atlanta/408686-brain-balance-my-add-child-6.html \r\n \r\n 08-04-2010 hrkheather \r\n I would also like to mention that Brain Balance hires people to scour the internet for forums, like this. They are hired to write numerous posts, in several aliases, as satisfied customers. \r\n \r\n --- \r\n http://www.city-data.com/forum/atlanta/408686-brain-balance-my-add-child-6.html \r\n \r\n 08-29-2010 tamadhur \r\n Brain Balance is about profit, pure and simple. Why on earth does someone need $7,000 to throw together a program that dedicated parents, with the support of qualified therapists and educators, could establish at home? What Brain Balance is doing is ripping off various approaches (biomedical, Defeat Autism Now!, Floortime), combining them with OT and ABA lite, and repackaging them as some innovative cure for autism. This is bunk. \r\n I spoke with an actual board-certified behavior analyst, with a PhD in psychology, and he referred to Brain Balance as \"snake oil.\" \r\n The guy who runs Brain Balance's franchise in Suwanee is not a neurologist; he is a chiropractor. Since Brain Balance claims their approach is rooted in neuroscience, shouldn't the people who run the place actually have backgrounds in neuroscience? \r\n I attended one of their free information sessions and found the presentation to be a little too slick and glib. I was also completely turned off by the guy's attitude. When I expressed my skepticism about this \"miraculous\" approach that no one else had discovered, and learned that the people working with my child were not actual psychologists or therapists, but just coaches with special training, the center director became very dismissive. Instead of making himself available to answer my questions, he sequestered himself in his office, leaving me wondering what kind of reception my child would receive if I decided to enroll him in the program. \r\n I am so grateful I decided not to give Brain Balance my money. \r\n My child was diagnosed with autism nearly four years ago. I have attended workshops, conferences, seminars, and classes, and have amassed a lot of information on potential treatments for autism. \r\n I know when an approach is rooted in science and when something is cleverly marketed to play on parents' emotions. Brain Balance is a marketing strategy to lure in gullible parents who are willing to plunk down thousands of dollars for a 3-month program they could easily implement at home for a fraction of the cost. \r\n I know when someone wants to genuinely help my child and when they are in it for the money. \r\n Autism parents be warned! There a whole lot of people out there who don't give a damn about your child but who are very interested in your money. \r\n \r\n Bottom line:  I am sure that the franchisees mean well and may \"believe\" in the efficacy of the \"treatment\" they offer, but I wouldn't waste my money or my child's time.   \u00a0 \r\n Update  I found another forum discussing the Brain Balance program.    I found another discussion of Brain Balance at the forum listed below: \r\n http://giftedissues.davidsongifted.org/BB/ubbthreads.php/topics/74063/menu_control_74075 \r\n \r\n From MegMeg 4/15/10  re a previous poster asking about Brain Balance: \r\n This is a load of snake-oil. If they have one jot of peer-reviewed, methodologically-sound evidence that these therapies work, I will eat my hat. \r\n (My field is cognitive neuroscience, so I'm allowed to be snarky about it. wink ) \r\n Seriously though, everything in this article sets off all the standard alarm bells. The blithe over-simplification of the science, the claims of outlandishly large results, the childishly simple theraputic techniques (a buzzer in the left ear will help autism? Really?) -- all of these are hallmarks of the pseudo-therapy industry. Don't even get me started on EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), or Facilitated Communication. \r\n From\u00a0 MegMeg on\u00a0 5/1/10  \r\n More digging turns up further oddities: the PsycInfo database shows he  [Melillo]  has only three publications, just one of which is peer-reviewed (the one discussed above), and it is in a journal so obscure that I cannot access it through the University of California. \r\n From MegMeg 6/11/10, responding to a question about Brain Balance  \r\n Maybe you should turn your question around and ask yourself, why are you taking anecdotal evidence as your gold standard? Personal stories 1) don't tell you what the overall success rates are (an individual anecdote may be wildly unrepresentative), and 2) they rely on subjective impressions of success rather than measured improvements. \r\n There's also a burden-of-proof issue here. Proposed therapies basically need to be assumed ineffective until proven otherwise. The fact that this therapy has not managed to generate a shred of research in its favor is a very bad sign. \r\n From MegMeg on 6/11/10 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n (previous commenter)  We've become intrigued by the whole Right Brain/Left Brain disconnect approach, As it is accepted science which i can GENERALLY understand. \r\n I also want to address this specifically. It is simply not true that any \"right brain/left brain disconnect approach\" to autism is accepted by serious researchers. Details upon request. \r\n From\u00a0 MegMeg on 6/12/10  \r\n (previous commenter)  You don't believe in the science behind delineating right brain/left brain processing? Thats well beyond being generally scientifically accepted. Even from a laymans persepective. \r\nI'm a neuroscientist by profession. Most of what laypeople know about left-brain/right-brain is wrong. I would be happy to give you a quick tutorial about what we do know about the specializations of the left and right hemispheres.....\r\n From MegMeg on 6/12/10 \r\n responding to the request about specialization of the left and right hemispheres \r\n The quick version is: \r\n Both hemispheres have areas for - visual processing - auditory processing - identifying familiar objects - processing spatial locations and spatial relationships - processing information coming in from the body - planning body movements - reasoning and decision-making - and much more \r\n The left hemisphere - has a few areas that are specialized for language (but may be more generally for fast temporal changes) \r\n The right hemisphere - is more strongly involved in spatial processing - is specialized for some \"large scale\" language stuff (e.g. discourse processing) \r\n All this is just for right-handers. Left handers may be the same, reversed, or mixed. \r\n The popular media have drastically over-exaggerated and over-simplified these issues. The whole \"right brain equals logical, sequential, detail-oriented, mathematical; left brain equals intuitive, wholistic, artistic\" mythology is just simply made up. \r\n The two hemispheres are connected by a thick band of communicative fibers called the corpus callosum. The two hemispheres function together as a single system. Everyone uses both. There is no such thing as a \"left-brained person\" or a \"right-brained person.\" \r\n As for citations, well, the literature is vast. Your best bet is a good undergraduate text in cognitive psychology or cognitive neuroscience. My personal choice is Reisberg's text, but it's quite pricey (they all are). \r\n \u00a0 \r\n Discussion betweetn Kriston & MegMeg on\u00a0 6/14/10 \r\n Kriston  I am COMPLETELY on-board the peer-reviewed, scientific evidence train. The plural of anecdote is not data. I can't even begin to tell you how strongly I agree! \r\n However... \r\n I think it's important to add that I'm similarly skeptical of the notion that because we don't know about something right now, it doesn't exist. I think we have to be very wary of accepting the current thinking as the ONLY POSSIBLE thinking, especially when it comes to the brain. \r\n The fact is that we don't know it all, and if past history is any indication of the future of science, some of what we think we know isn't 100% correct yet. Science is always evolving, happily. \r\n Lack of peer-reviewed evidence is not evidence that something doesn't exist or isn't happening. It may just mean that it hasn't yet been studied. Lack of peer-reviewed evidence isn't the same as a debunking. \r\n With that said, I completely agree that lack of evidence of effectiveness is a *very* good reason to think twice--or 3 or 4 or 5 times!--before handing someone your money for an unproven treatment for a disorder that may not even exist. \r\n Basically I dislike blind faith in anything, even science! \r\n From MegMeg responding to Kriston : \r\n You raise an important issue. It's one that I think is very much misunderstood by the non-scientist public. First, scientists would be the first to say that we don't have all the answers yet! Especially when it comes to understanding the brain, everybody in the biz knows that we have barely scratched the surface. \r\n But that is a separate issue from, second, whether a particular proposal has any truth to it. This is where scientists start to get impatient and sound like know-it-alls. Because, really, we've been around that block SO many times, it's like playing whack-a-mole. \r\n This is where the burden-of-proof issue comes in. It is incumbent upon the person proposing a theory to provide SOME reason, ANY reason, why it should be taken seriously, before asking people to waste their time and scarce research funds looking into it. Our culture has this myth of the persecuted genius (think Galileo) who is eventually vindicated by history. But that kind of thing is rare. Vanishingly rare. Meanwhile, there is a river of crackpot ideas that will never be anything but crackpot. \r\n It's like being asked, \"You don't believe in the Easter Bunny? Why not? Give me all your reasons and arguments, in explicit detail. Oh, okay, I guess that sounds kinda convincing, but what about Santa Claus? Why don't you believe in him? Don't you think you're being a little closed-minded? What about Ganesh? Leprechauns? Aliens who built the pyramids? Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, ya know.\" \r\n This analogy might sound rather snarky and unfair, but it's really pretty accurate. Because another feature of these kinds of theories is their sheer implausibility. Their quality of pulled-out-of-nowhere-ness. Their complete lack of fit with everything else we already know. \r\n This leads to my next point, which is the myth that scientists are dismissive of any idea that hasn't already been proven. In fact, scientists LOVE new and promising ideas. Think of the history of AIDS treatment research. There were numerous ideas and approaches that seemed promising and raised scientists' hopes, that turned out to be dead ends, before real progress finally started happening. Those early treatments were taken seriously because there was some reason to think they could pan out. For example, maybe a certain effect worked in the petri dish, but just didn't scale up (or whatever). This is one of the important features that distinguishes viable theories from theories that make scientists roll their eyeballs. \r\n Thanks for raising this important issue, and giving me a chance to do another Public Service Announcement! \r\n \r\n So: Burden of proof is on the Brain Balance corporation to prove that it is efficacious for the conditions it claims to help.\u00a0 I'm not holding my breath. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://specialed.wordpress.com/2006/03/20/the-fleecing-of-the-autism-community/", "http://giftedissues.davidsongifted.org/BB/ubbthreads.php/topics/74063/menu_control_74075", "http://www.city-data.com/forum/atlanta/408686-brain-balance-my-add-child-6.html", "http://www.brainbalancecenters.com/", "http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2010/08/three-ways-to-improve-cognitive-test.html", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6736", "http://daisymayfattypants.blogspot.com/2010/08/brain-balance-centers-critique.html", "http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2541", "http://www.jsonline.com/business/108047584.html", "http://www.franchisedirect.com/childrensfranchises/brain-balance-achievement-centers-franchise-07622/", "http://denver.craigslist.org/edu/2049522111.html", "http://daisymayfattypants.blogspot.com/2010/08/brain-balance-centers-critique.html", "http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2541", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6736", "http://autismvancouver.blogspot.com/2010/11/brain-balance-might-not-be-so-balanced.html#comment-form", "http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2010/08/three-ways-to-improve-cognitive-test.html", "http://www.franchisedirect.com/childrensfranchises/brain-balance-achievement-centers-franchise-07622/", "http://www.jsonline.com/business/108047584.html", "http://www.city-data.com/forum/atlanta/408686-brain-balance-my-add-child-4.html ", "http://www.city-data.com/forum/atlanta/408686-brain-balance-my-add-child-5.html", "http://www.city-data.com/forum/atlanta/408686-brain-balance-my-add-child-6.html", "http://www.city-data.com/forum/atlanta/408686-brain-balance-my-add-child-6.html", "http://www.city-data.com/forum/atlanta/408686-brain-balance-my-add-child-6.html", "http://giftedissues.davidsongifted.org/BB/ubbthreads.php/topics/74063/menu_control_74075\""], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/12/is-this-a-money-making-opportunity-for-franchisees-or-a-legitimate-therapy.html", "title": "Is This A Money-Making Opportunity for Franchisees, or A Legitimate Therapy?"},

{"date": "Sunday, May 16, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Part I of a four-part series on the IACC \r\n \r\n Part I -- IACC background \r\n Part II-- IACC: Coverage from \"The Daily Web Newpaper of the Autism Epidemic\" \r\n Part III--IACC:  Coverage elsewhere on the web of IACC meetings, announcements, plans, and issues \r\n Part IV--2010 IACC members \r\n \r\n \r\nWhat is the Interagency Autism Coordinating Council (IACC), and why should you care?\r\n \r\n\r\n If you are a person affected by autism, you should care because this is the big bear in the room as far as autism research and service provision goes. If you are not affected by autism, you should care if you are a taxpayer \r\n\r\n \r\nThe federal government authorizes  interagency coordinating councils and advisory councils   in many different areas of interest, of which the IACC is one. The IACC began in 2001, as authorized by the Children's Children\u2019s Health Act (CHA) of 2000.  The CHA directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to :\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n Establish an Interagency Autism Coording Committee to coordinate all efforts within HHS concerning autism. \r\n Expand, intensify, and coordinate activies of the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIH) with respect to research on autism \r\n Develop disabilities surveillance and research programs \r\n Establish and implement a program to provide information and education on autism to health professionals and the general public, including information and education on advances in diagnosis and treatment of autism and training and continuing education through programs for scientists, physicians, and other health professionals who provide care for patients with autism. \r\n Submit an annual report to Congress \"concerning the implementation of this title and the amendments made by this title.\" \r\n \r\n\r\n In 2007, the IACC was re-authorized by the Combating Autism Act (CAA). \r\n\r\n The  Combating Autism Act (CAA)  was a bi-partisan bill with broad support, introduced in 2005.\u00a0 The original version  was opposed by Rep. Joe Barton , R-Texas, because of one provision to direct federal funding toward specific research priorities. When that provision was restated, the revised bill passed, and was  signed into law by President Bush on December 19, 2006 . Among its provisions were the re-authorization of the IACC with a broader mandate.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Act Calls On The Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) To Enhance Information Sharing. The IACC provides a forum to facilitate the efficient and effective exchange of information about autism activities, programs, policies, and research among the Federal government, several non-profit groups, and the public. The Combating Autism Act requires the IACC to provide information and recommendations on ASD-related programs, and to continue its work to develop and update annually a strategic plan for ASD research.\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom the IAAC website:\r\n \r\n The Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC)  is a Federal advisory committee that coordinates all efforts within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) concerning autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Through its inclusion of both Federal and public members, the IACC helps to ensure that a wide range of ideas and perspectives are represented and discussed in a public forum. \r\n The IACC mission is to: \r\n \r\n Provide advice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding Federal activities related to autism spectrum disorder. \r\n Facilitate the exchange of information on and coordination of ASD activities among the member agencies and organizations. \r\n Increase public understanding of the member agencies' activities, programs, policies, and research by providing a public forum for discussions related to ASD research and services. \r\n \r\n \r\nIACC meetings are open to the public and include presentations and discussions on a variety of topics, including activities and projects of the IACC, recent advances in science and autism policy issues. A portion of each meeting is reserved for public comment.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nThe  first meeting of the second iteration of the IACC took place in Washington, D.C., on November 30, 2007 \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/com.html", "http://iacc.hhs.gov/reports/reports-to-congress/FY2001.shtml", "http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:SN00843:@@@L&summ2=m", "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=2708925&page=1", "http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/12/20061219-3.html", "http://www.iacc.hhs.gov/", "http://www.iacc.hhs.gov/events/2007/full-committee-mtg-agenda-nov30.shtml"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/05/the-interagency-autism-coordinating-councilpart-i-background.html", "title": "The Interagency Autism Coordinating Council--Part I, Background"},

I have to confess, I don't read those articles very carefully, but I'm glad somebody is covering these essential decision-making meetings.  \r\n\r\n I also have to confess I don't read Age of Autism (AoA) all that closely.\u00a0 It's in my reader feed, and I scan the headlines and click through to read articles that interest me.\u00a0 I rarely take the time to comment because of  its comment moderation practice . Still, I do scan it.\u00a0 I had noticed that the paper regularly posts announcements of IACC meetings, and I suppose I assumed that they also published summaries of the content of the meetings.\u00a0 This is relatively easy to do, as IACC publishes the  meetings' agendas, materials, minutes of the meetings, and videocasts.  \r\n\r\n On May 15, AoA published an article by one of its regular contributors,  Katie Wright , that I found astonishing in its tone and presuppositions. \r\n\r\n I decided to test my naive assumption that AoA was covering the IACC meetings. I went to the IACC website, made a list of all the meetings. Then I went to Age of Autism and listed every post that mentioned IACC meetings. The results were disheartening. \r\n\r\n\r\n This Age of Autism posts on the IACC and its members (posts that merely announce how and where to participate,etc., omitted) since November 27, 2007.\u00a0 AoA posts in roman type; wimportant IACC dates\u00a0  in italic \r\n\r\n \r\n 2007 \r\n Age of Autism began publication on  June 17, 2007 as the Rescue Post , \"an interactive site devoted to news, views and opinion from inside the the autism community\". \r\n November 28, 2007:\u00a0 HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt's\u00a0  announces the members  appointed to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 new Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee.  \r\n November 30, 2007 Full Committee meeting of IACC \r\n 2008 \r\n January 12 2008 Jim Moody:  What's So Secret about Autism Science \r\n January 15, 2008, JB Handley:  Grinker's Stinker: His Wife Runs the IACC  \r\n January 15-18: Scientific Workshops on Biology, Treatment, Diagnosis, and Risk Factors \r\n February 21, 2008 IACC First Strategic Planning Workgroup \r\n  March 14, 2008IACC Full Committee \r\n April 21, 2008 IACC Second Strategic Planning Workgroup \r\n April 30, 2008 IACC Services Subcommittee Webinar and Conference Call \r\n\t\r\n May 3, 2008 IACC Town Hall\r\n \r\n May 12, 2008 IACC Full Committee \r\n June 13, 2008 IACC Services Subcommittee \r\n July 8, 2008 IACC Third Strategic Planning Workgroup  \r\n July 8 2008 Jim Moody:  The Strategic Plan For The Combating Autism Act \r\n July 15, 2008 IACC Full Committee (includes release of Summary of Advances in Autism Spectrum Disorder Research:\u00a0 Calendar Year 2007) \r\n August 8 2008 IACC Strategic Planning Implementation Workgroup  \r\n August 25 2008: Kelli Ann Davis  NIMH Flip-Flops on Pivotal IACC Workgroup Meeting \r\n September 10, 2008 IACC Strategic Planning Implementation Workgroup \r\n September 15, 2008 IACC Services Subcommittee Webinar and Conference Call \r\n October 10, 2008 IACC Services Subcommittee Webinar and Conference Call \r\n November 21 2008 IACC Full Committee \r\n December 10 2008 IACC Services Subcommittee Webinar and Conference Cal l \r\n December 11, 2008: Jim Moody:  IACC Meeting Friday to Finalize Federal Autism Research Plan \r\n December 12, 2008 IACC Full Committee \r\n 2009 \r\n January 14 2009 IACC Full Committee \r\n January 14, 2009, Jim Moody:  IACC to Finalize Federal Autism Research Plan \r\n January 15 2009  Alison Singer No Longer Speaks for Autism Speaks: Autism Speaks Withdraws Support For Strategic Plan For Autism Research, Decries Unexpected Change In Final Approval Process \r\n  January 16, 2009:  TACA: IACC Rescinds Vaccine Research Initiatives \r\n January 16, 2009: SafeMinds: Federal Members of Advisory Committee Block Vaccine-Autism Research \r\n January 17, 2009  National Autism Association on IACC Removal of Vaccine Safety Research \r\n January 19, 2009:  Generation Rescue Seeks Legal Advice on IACC Violations \r\n  January 22, 2009: Katie Wright,  IACC Insanity \r\n January 26 2009  Protest Federal Autism Committee\u2019s Deceitful Reversal on Vaccine-Autism Research \r\n J anuary 26, 2009:\u00a0 Release of  The 2009 Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee Strategic Plan for Autism Spectrum Disorder Research -

Let's start with the language the 'friend' in the letter used. \"Fixed\".  When someone talks about getting 'fixed' in that sense, it is usually directed towards a household pet in need of spaying/neutering so that they won't spray on furniture or display aggressive behaviour. Do I even need to explain the history of comparing people who are developmentally disabled to animals, and using such logic to justify their horrible treatment, including but not limited to torture, deprivation of essentials, and yes, sterilization? How far have we come in how we view disabled people? If this friend's attitude is any indication, not very far.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nShe goes on to write:  \r\n \r\n Developmentally disabled children are treated as special \"burdens\" to be borne by saintly neurotypical able-bodied parents, and as adults, we are denied the chance to become parents ourselves, because we've shifted in neurotypical eyes from being an adorable burden to a worrisome burden. No thoughts or considerations on what we desire in terms of our reproductive rights and parenthood; it's frequently assumed these topics are beyond our understanding. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Shaker Lydia Encyclopedia's previous post, Disablism and my life,  should be studied by all those who advocate for people with autism. \r\n\r\n For family reasons, I am not at all offended by part of Abby's response to the mother, \r\n\r\n make sure Jasper clearly understands everything he needs to know to protect himself and his nice girlfriend from premature parenthood. \r\n\r\nEven neurotypical young men and women, who know all about safe sex and contraception, can throw away what they know in the heat of the moment.

Even the smallest little ball of mercury in that image is  thousands of times larger than the amount of mercury in the shot. You  couldn\u2019t even SEE the mercury if it was properly represented. \r\n What is missing is the perspective on how much mercury is actually in the MINORITY of flu shots that do still contain mercury. It\u2019s 25 micrograms. Do you actually understand how small a microgram is? Using the density of elemental mercury, it turns out that 25 micrograms corresponds to a tiny ball with a diameter of 0.15 mm. That\u2019s how much mercury. (And I know there\u2019s no liquid mercury in the shot, but that\u2019s what they show). \r\n That\u2019s just one example of how this commercial is so misleading. \r\n I don\u2019t naturally think in metric units, so I like to use homely images to visualize. \r\n Do most people have whole peppercorns at home? I do. I\u2019ve measured a sample & they are about 3.5 mm in diameter. So 3.5/0.15 = 23 times bigger in diameter \u2014 let alone the volume calculation. \r\n Do most people have whole rice at home? I do. Raw long grain rice is about 2 mm wide, or 13.3 times wider across than the imaginary ball of ethyl mercury in vaccines. \r\n Hair from a human head is normally between .04 and .25 millimeters, averaging normally .1 So here\u2019s how to visualize the diameter of a drop of ethyl mercury: \r\n Take a single hair from somebody who has somewhat coarse hair. Clip off the end at a 90-degree angle. You have made a one-hair brush. Dip the hair in black ink and gently dot the one-hair brush straight down on a clean piece of non-absorbent paper. \r\n I am pretty sure that I could not see the resultant dot with my naked eye, or with my usual glasses. I\u2019m guessing I\u2019d need at least 10x magnification to even spot it, let alone measure it. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/12/why-the-safeminds-propaganda-piece-was-wrong.html", "title": "Mercury in flu vaccine"},

Perhaps, but not at the pressures attainable in the \u201csoft chambers\u201d used by most \u201calternative\u201d autism practitioners. \r\n If they really wanted to see the effects of pressure alone, the HBOT \u201cresearchers\u201d could dilute the air in the \u201csoft chamber\u201d with an inert gas such as helium so that the partial pressures of nitrogen and oxygen remain the same as they are at sea level (or whatever the ambient pressure is). This would require (at sea level) a mix of 23% helium and 77% air. It would be a simple test (and safe - even breathing the mix at sea level pressure would not be dangerous, as it still contains 16% oxygen) and would finally put to rest any question about the need for (mildly) elevated pressure. \r\n Unfortunately,  the risks of using real hyperbaric therapy (not to mention the costs) outweigh the potential benefits (which are largely hypothetical and unproven), so a trial of real HBOT for autism is probably not in our future. \r\n \r\n Rossignol\u00a0 et al. \u00a0 November 16 2007\u00a0  The effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on oxidative stress, inflammation, and symptoms in children with autism: an open-label pilot study.

For most students, academic and social achievements closely relate to the degree to which parents are involved with their child\u2019s schools.  In special education, however, we know little about these issues.  Few studies have examined parent knowledge of the IEP process, parent advocacy skills, or parent-school relations, nor how each relates to parent stress. Similarly, we do not yet know the degree to which a parent\u2019s ability to navigate the IEP process and collaborate with the school might be related to aspects of parents or of children with disabilities. \r\n This study attempts to understand parent-school collaboration by asking about 5 distinct areas.  After a first section in which we request basic demographic information, we then ask about characteristics of the child with disabilities; characteristics of the respondent; and characteristics of parent-school relations and services. We end this survey by inviting you to tell us\u2014in your own words\u2014about your overall experiences in dealing with the school and what advice you would give to parents and teachers. \r\n All together, this survey should take about 25-30 minutes to complete.

The series is based on interviews, documents and data, collected during seven years of inquiries by award-winning investigative journalist Brian Deer. \r\n Thanks to the recent publication of the General Medical Council\u2019s six million word transcript, the BMJ was able to peer-review and check Deer\u2019s findings and confirm extensive falsification in the Lancet paper. \r\n In an editorial, Dr Godlee, together with deputy BMJ editor Jane Smith, and leading paediatrician and associate BMJ editor Harvey Marcovitch, conclude that there is \u201cno doubt\u201d that it was Wakefield who perpetrated this fraud. They say: \u201cA great deal of thought and effort must have gone into drafting the paper to achieve the results he wanted: the discrepancies all led in one direction; misreporting was gross.\u201d \r\n Yet he has repeatedly denied doing anything wrong at all, they add. \u201cInstead, although now disgraced and stripped of his clinical and academic credentials, he continues to push his views. Meanwhile the damage to public health continues.\u201d \r\n \r\n \u201cScience is based on trust,\u201d concludes Dr Godlee. \u201cSuch a breach of trust is deeply shocking. And even though almost certainly rare on this scale, it raises important questions about how this could happen, what could have been done to uncover it earlier, what further inquiry is now needed, and what can be done to prevent something like this happening again.\u201d \r\n \r\n Editorial: Wakefield\u2019s article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent\u00a0   Download MMR1edit \r\n Table contrasting the Lancet paper with NHS records of patient diagnoses and histories:   Download MMR1table \r\n Article: Secrets of the MMR scare: how the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed   Download MMR1 \r\n Online analysis: Piltdown medicine: The missing link between MMR and autism   Download MMR1blog \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/01/press-release-from-the-british-medical-journal-wakefields-mmr-study-an-elaborate-fraud-.html", "title": "The British Medical Journal: Wakefield's MMR Study \"An Elaborate Fraud\" "},

You take a group of kids who all got vaccines but got a little less mercury and compare them to a group of kids who all got vaccines but a little more mercury and find there's no difffenced in autism and then claim that vaccines don't cause autism.  The only appropriate study to do would be to look at a group of childrren who never got vaccines and a group of children who got all of them,  and see if there's a difference in autism rates and that study has never been done despite many people trying to call for it. \r\n \r\n In 2007, Mr. Handley's organization commissioned and published a telephone survey, asking respondents their children's vaccine and neurocognitive status.\u00a0 The survey was rubbish and was rightly ridiculed, as the links below show.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n June 26, 2007 Kev at LeftBrain/RightBrain  Generation Rescue Survey Results  http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2007/06/generation-rescue-survey-results/ \r\n This is a disaster for Generation Rescue and the whole \u2018vaccines cause autism\u2019 debacle. Generation Rescue\u2019s data indicates that you are \u2018safer\u2019 from autism if you fully vaccinate than partially vaccinate. It also indicates that across the spectrum of autism, you are only 1% more likely to be autistic if you have had any sort of vaccination as oppose to no vaccinations at all \u2013 and that's only if you are male. If you are a girl your chances of being on the spectrum are less if you have been vaccinated! Across both boys and girls, your chances of being on the spectrum are  less  if you have received all vaccinations. \r\n \r\n June 27, 2007\u00a0  Survey Says...Nothing  Prometheus at Photon in the Darkness  http://photoninthedarkness.blogspot.com/2007/06/survey-says-nothing.html \r\n Generation Rescue just published their long-awaited telephone survey results that showed - surprise! - that vaccinations cause autism. Well, actually, it doesn't  really  show that vaccines cause autism, what it shows is that vaccines cause \"neurological disorders\", loosely defined as autism (or autistic spectrum disorder) and/or ADD/ADHD. Except that it really doesn't show  that , either. So what does the survey show? Well, let's just take a look. \r\n \r\n June 27, 2007 Orac at Respectful Insolence  Fun With Phone Surveys and Vaccines   http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/fun_with_phone_surveys.php \r\n Not surprisingly, given the source, the \" study \" turns out to be totally underwhelming, nothing more than a phone poll really. (Amusingly,  David Kirby  has said that he doesn't consider phone surveys to be \"data.\") Even so,  expect to see it trumpeted all over antivaccination websites and blogs  as \"proof\" that vaccines cause autism or, at the very least, as  \"evidence\" that compels a study. It might be, if it weren't so poorly  designed and analyzed and if it actually showed what GR claims that it  shows. \r\n \r\n September 3, 2007 Joseph at Natural Variation  A Simple Selection Bias Model Explains Generation Rescue's Survey Results  http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/09/simple-selection-bias-model-explains.html \r\n What I want to do in this post is go over a model that explains the  survey results, including discrepancies between its findings and those  of prior phone surveys. Data of this nature can sometimes result in  knowledge that wasn't expected, as I will hopefully demonstrate. \r\n \r\n \r\n Generation Rescue and other anti-vaccine activists then switched to asking for a study comparing autism rates in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations.\u00a0 Handley's January 6, 2010 is just the latest in a long string of demands.\u00a0 There are particular barriers to doing cuch a study, which has been widely discussed by science bloggers. \u00a0 \r\n What follows is a list of blog posts that have addressed the issues: This issue has been discussed at length. \r\n \r\n July 19, 2007  Let's Do a Study!

The folks at GR are pushing for this despite the fact that their baloney \u201csurvey\u201d showed no connection between autism and vaccination. \r\n \r\n  October 20, 2007  We Want a Study!  Prometheus at Photon in the Darkness   http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=121  \r\n Let me run you all through the process of designing a study to show that thimerosal does or does not cause autism. Perhaps you will see why \u201cnobody\u201d has \u201cdone the study\u201d that these parents are yearning for. And why probably nobody ever will. \r\n \r\n  November 3 2008  Let's Put on a Study!  Prometheus at Photon in the Darkness  http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=154\u00a0 \r\n The interest in \u201cdoing a study\u201d seems to stem from the idea that the only way to find if vaccines are connected with autism is to study unvaccinated children and compare their autism prevalence with vaccinated children. This is  not  true and is - in fact -  not  even the most effective way to study the postulated connection, as I will show later. \r\n \r\n  April 14, 2009   Feasibility study of\u00a0 Vaccinated/Unvaccinated/Alternatively Vaccinated Children  National Vaccine Advisory Council (NVAC) Vaccine Safety Working Group Draft Report    www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/.../NVACVaccineSafetyWGReport041409.pdf\u00a0 \u00a0  (full text is at the bottom of this post)  \r\n  April 27, 2009\u00a0  Human subjects protections and research ethics: Where the rubber hits the road for science-based medicine  David Gorski MD at Science-Based Medicine  http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=467 \u00a0  An in-depth, but accessibly to lay readers, discussion of ethical limitations in medical research.  \r\n  June 2, 2009  Recommendations on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Immunization Safety Office Draft 5-Year Scientific Agenda  National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC)   www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/.../nvacrecommendationsisoscientificagenda.pdf \u00a0\r\n The NVAC endorses the Writing Group\u2019s recommendation for an external expert committee, such as the Institute of Medicine, with broad methodological, design, and ethical expertise to consider \u201cstrengths and weaknesses, ethical issues and feasibility including timelines and cost of various study designs to examine outcomes in unvaccinated, vaccine delayed and vaccinated children and report back to the NVAC. \r\n \r\n  June 06 2009  A Vaccinated vs. Unvaccinated Study  Kev Leitch at LeftBrain/RightBrain  http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/06/a-vaccinated-vs-unvaccinated-study/  Discussion of the 2007 Generation Rescue phone survey. \r\n  August 24, 2009  The perils and pitfalls of doing a \u201cvaccinated versus unvaccinated\u201d study\u00a0  David Gorski MD, at Science-Based Medicine \u00a0   http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=939\u00a0  \r\n On the other hand, antivaccinationists should be very careful what they ask for. They may just make enough of a pain of themselves to get it. True, getting the resources necessary to do a study the like of what Prometheus described initially would monopolize autism research funding for years, but the anti-vaccine movement doesn\u2019t really care about that, because it\u2019s always been all about the vaccines more than helping autistic children. \r\n \r\n  June 08 2010  Generation Rescue's proposed vaccinated vs. unvaccinated study  Sullivan at Leftbrain/Rightbrain  http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/06/generation-rescues-vaccinatedunvaccinated-study/  In-depth analysis of a study proposal published by Generation Rescue, including analysis of study design and qualifications of the researchers.  \r\n December 10, 2010  Of SBM and EBM Redux.

Dozens of studies have been performed in the United States and elsewhere. The purpose of this document is to list those studies and provide links to the publications to allow parents and all those who administer or recommend vaccines to read the evidence for themselves. The studies provided have been published in peer-reviewed medical journals. These studies do not show any link between MMR vaccine, thimerosal and autism. This is not an exhaustive list and it will need to be updated frequently since vaccine safety studies are ongoing. \r\n \r\n \u00a0   Click the link to download a paper copy of this paper.

The Working Group considered drafting a recommendation for an IOM review of the science, epidemiology and feasibility of studies of unvaccinated, vaccine delayed, and vaccinated children. The Writing Group Draft Document on Gaps in Research Agenda further developed this idea. The Working Group wishes to clarify several points on this topic. First, the Working Group believes that the strongest study design, a randomized clinical trial that includes a study arm receiving no vaccine or vaccine not given in accord with the current recommended schedule, is not ethical, would not pass IRB review, and cannot be done. The type of study that is being suggested would be an observational study of populations looking at natural variation in vaccination schedules including some children where vaccination is declined through parental intent. All children in the study should be recommended to receive the standard immunization schedule. The Working Group endorses the Writing Group\u2019s recommendation for an external expert committee, such as the Institute of Medicine, with broad methodological, design, and ethical expertise to consider \u201cstrengths and weaknesses, ethical issues and feasibility including timelines and cost of various study designs to examine outcomes in unvaccinated, vaccine delayed and vaccinated children and report back to the NVAC.\u201d \r\n The Working Group does not necessarily agree with all of the language in the Writing Group\u2019s statement, but with its general intent. The process should be open and transparent, engaging individuals from a broad range of sectors. Considerations as outlined by the Writing Group and modified by the Working Group are as follows: \r\n \r\n  This review should consider strengths and weaknesses, ethical issues and feasibility including timelines and cost of various study designs and report back to the NVAC  \r\n Consideration should be given to broad biomedical research including laboratory studies, and animal studies.  \r\n Consideration should also be given to study designs comparing children vaccinated by the standard immunization schedule with unvaccinated children (by parental intention), and possibly partially vaccinated children or children vaccinated by alternative immunization schedules  \r\n Outcomes to assess include biomarkers of immunity and metabolic dysfunction, and outcomes including but not limited to neurodevelopmental outcomes, allergies, asthma, immune-mediated diseases, and other developmental disabilities such as epilepsy, intellectual disability and learning disabilities.  \r\n The inclusion of autism as an outcome is desired. This review should also consider what impact the inclusion of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) as an outcome would have on study designs and feasibility, as referenced in the IACC letter to NVAC.  \r\n This review should be conducted expeditiously, in a transparent manner, and involving broad public and stakeholder input. \r\n \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/01/jb-handley-of-generation-rescue-on-cnn/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2007/06/generation-rescue-survey-results/", "http://photoninthedarkness.blogspot.com/2007/06/survey-says-nothing.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/fun_with_phone_surveys.php", "http://www.generationrescue.org/survey.html", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=503", "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/09/simple-selection-bias-model-explains.html", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=100", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=121 ", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=154", "www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/.../NVACVaccineSafetyWGReport041409.pdf ", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=467", "www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/.../nvacrecommendationsisoscientificagenda.pdf", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/06/a-vaccinated-vs-unvaccinated-study/", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=939 ", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/06/generation-rescues-vaccinatedunvaccinated-study/", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=8874"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/01/the-issues-in-undertaking-a-vaccinated-vs-unvaccinated-study.html", "title": "The Issues in Undertaking a Study of Autism Incidence/Prevalence in Vaccinated vs. Unvaccinated Populations "},

BishopBlog: What's in a name? . \r\n We are stuck between the proverbial rock and hard place. It seems that if we stick with medical-sounding labels for neurodevelopmental disorders, they are treated seriously and gain public recognition and research funding. Furthermore, they seem to be generally preferred by those who are affected by these conditions. However, we know these labels are misleading in implying that we are dealing with clearcut syndromes with a single known cause.  So here\u2019s a proposal that attempts to steer a course through this morass. We should use the term \u2018neurodevelopmental disability\u2019 as a generic term, and then add a descriptor to indicate the areas of major difficulty. Let me explain why each part of the term is useful. \u201cNeurodevelopmental\u201d indicates that the child\u2019s difficulties have a constitutional basis. This is not the same as saying they can\u2019t be changed, but it does move us away from the idea that these are some kind of social constructs with no biological basis. The evidence for a biological contributory causes is considerable for those conditions where there have been significant neurological and genetic investigations: dyslexia, SLI, autism and ADHD. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://psyweb.psy.ox.ac.uk/oscci/Dorothy%20Bishop.htm", "http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2010/12/whats-in-name.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/12/renaming-conditions-such-as-dyslexia-argument-for.html", "title": "Renaming Conditions Such as Dyslexia: Argument For"},

{"date": "Sunday, January 16, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t See foot of article for update \r\n \r\n Correcting our record - Inside Salon - Salon.com .  In 2005, Salon published online an exclusive story by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that offered an explosive premise: that the mercury-based thimerosal compound present in vaccines until 2001 was dangerous, and that he was \"convinced that the link between thimerosal and the epidemic of childhood neurological disorders is real.\" \r\n The piece was co-published with  Rolling Stone  magazine -- they fact-checked it and published it in print; we posted it online. In the days after running \"Deadly Immunity,\" we amended the story with five corrections (which can still be found logged here) that went far in undermining Kennedy's expos\u00e9. At the time, we felt that correcting the piece -- and keeping it on the site, in the spirit of transparency -- was the best way to operate.

{"date": "Friday, January 21, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Updated see below \r\n The  California Endowment  has a new enterprise,  Reporting on Health ,\u00a0 which includes journalism fellowships and blogs. \r\n One of the fellows is  William Heisel ; his blog is  Antidote: New Ways to Investigate Untold Health Stories .\u00a0 \r\n His advice for reporters, drawn from the lessons of\u00a0 the Wakefield fraud, in seven parts: \r\n Wakefield's Wake, Part 1: Media should help undo damage from vaccine-autism hoax   a description of the sources Deer used for his BMJ pieces:  \r\n \r\n These documents and the rest used by Deer are great guideposts for health writers, bloggers and investigators hoping to fix what Wakefield and his colleagues have broken. \r\n \r\n Wakefield's Wake Part 2: Passionate parents of autistic children can be tricky sources . \r\n This should serve as a lesson to health writers everywhere never to assume that the research subjects involved in a study actually saw the outcome of the study. Those subjects, should you be able to track them down, could provide the necessary evidence for verifying \u2013 or disproving \u2013 the study\u2019s findings or probing flaws in the study\u2019s design. \r\n Wakefield\u2019s Wake, Part 3: Trust parents of autistic kids, but verify stories with health records   note: this is sound advice for all unusual health claims, not just the \"something caused autism\" story.\u00a0 Two things to keep in mind: \"correlation does not equal causation\" and \"anecdotes are not data, even in the plural\". \r\n As research has shown, self-reported health information is often flawed. Most parents \u2014 including McCarthy \u2014 aren\u2019t trying to deceive anyone. When talking to a reporter, though, they may not be able to, on command, provide the clearest picture of the dates, symptoms, test results and other medical facts involving their child. \r\n Wakefield's Wake, Part 4: Overcome confidentiality rules used to hide shaky science \r\n ....reporters need to push past glib suggestions that parents are wrong to be talking about these issues or that reporters are wrong for talking with the parents. \r\n One of the ways I have pushed past is by asking people if I can talk with their doctors directly and providing them with a release form to sign. I created a short form years ago based on a standard form that has been used by hospitals and physicians to allow patients to waive HIPAA protections. The terminology is important. You want to make it clear to patients and their parents that they are protected by HIPAA from having their private medical information disclosed and that by signing this form they are waiving those protections for the purposes of providing you information for a story. \r\n Wakefield\u2019s Wake, Part 5: Treat advocacy groups with a healthy dose of skepticism \r\n So what\u2019s a health writer who wants some good contextual quotes to do? \r\n First, stop dialing groups for a quote just because their name sounds on target. Placing \u201cAmerican\u201d in front of something doesn\u2019t make it a truly national or nationally representative group. Including \u201cautism\u201d in a name doesn\u2019t mean that the group is involved in serious work to find cures and treatments for autism disorders. \r\n Second, treat these advocates the way you would any other source. I mentioned this before with parents, and it is worth repeating. Don\u2019t let advocates make bold claims without proof.  Robert Goldberg , author of  Tabloid Medicine , posted a  great video  about what reporters should have said when interviewing Jenny McCarthy, who, as everyone knows, has her own advocacy organization: Generation Rescue. \r\n Third, find out who is paying the bills. If they are registered as a nonprofit, they have to file a Form 990 with the IRS, and you can ask them for a copy, ask the IRS for a copy or look it up on Guidestar. If they are not registered as a nonprofit, that\u2019s odd and should make you ask even more questions. \r\n I would add: this advice holds true not just for autism, but any \"miracle cure\" for conditions that are defined qualitatively -- like learning disabilities. \r\n Update: \r\n Wakefield's Wake Part 6: Don't call it a witch hunt: Scientists who perpetrated autism-vaccine scare should be called out \r\n \r\n ...A witch hunt, of course, implies a band of crazed bigots and fear-mongers falsely accusing someone of a socially unacceptable act. Charges are trumped up. A trial is hastily put together. Witnesses lie. And the witch is burned at the stake. Even as metaphor, this doesn\u2019t work in the Wakefield case or others like it. Government investigators and journalists like Deer didn\u2019t try to pin some false crime on Wakefield. As Deer puts it:\u00a0 \u201cThe regulator\u2019s main focus was whether the research was ethical. Mine was whether it was true.\u201d \r\n \r\n Take-away lessons for journalists  \r\n \r\n Follow up by writing about scientists who have cited work by discredited scientists \r\n Question out-of-nowhere advances in science and medicine \r\n Follow up by writing about who decided to fund, support and publish  the discredited research.\u00a0 Hold the decision-makers accountable. \r\n \r\n Wakefield's Wake, Part 7: Blowback can be fierce and frightening for autism-vaccine stories \r\n \r\n It underscored for me that journalists who take on vaccine conspiracy theories and other controversial topics need to prepare themselves and their editors for blowback. \r\n Parents who are advocating for their children are fighters, as they should be. But they can start to develop an us-versus-them mentality. \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.calendow.org/", "http://www.reportingonhealth.org/", "http://www.reportingonhealth.org/users/william-heisel-0", "http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/antidote", "http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/wakefields-wake-part-1-media-should-help-undo-damage-vaccine-autism-hoax", "http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/wakefields-wake-part-2-passionate-parents-autistic-children-can-be-tricky-sources", "http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/wakefield%E2%80%99s-wake-part-3-trust-parents-autistic-kids-verify-stories-health-records", "http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/wakefields-wake-part-4-overcome-confidentiality-rules-used-hide-shaky-science", "http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/wakefield%E2%80%99s-wake-part-5-treat-advocacy-groups-healthy-dose-skepticism", "https://twitter.com/#!/Tabloidmed", "http://www.amazon.com/Tabloid-Medicine-Internet-Medical-Science/dp/1607147270", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaZlcpe3VDk", "http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/dont-call-it-witch-hunt-scientists-who-perpetrated-autism-vaccine-scare-should-be-called-out", "http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/wakefields-wake-part-7-blowback-can-be-fierce-and-frightening-autism-vaccine-stories"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/01/reflections-on-wakefields-fraud.html", "title": "Lessons for reporters from Brian Deer's investigation of Wakefield's fraud"},

For each patient, medical histories, vaccination records, histopathology reports, and ileocolonoscopic biopsy tissue were available for evaluation. Terminal ileum (TI) biopsy tissue was assayed by RT-PCR for the presence of measles virus RNA and PCR-positive samples were sequenced. \r\n Results: Medical and clinical data have been collected for >275 patients who fit the study inclusion criteria. PCR analysis on TI biopsy tissue from an initial 82 patients showed that 70 (85%) were positive for the F gene amplicon. Fourteen have been verified by DNA sequence and an additional 56 amplicons are being sequenced now. Work is ongoing to assay the remaining specimens (~200) and to identify and assay relevant control tissue samples. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this large cohort of pediatric autistic patients with chronic GI symptoms confirm earlier findings of measles virus RNA in the terminal ileum and support an association between measles virus and ileocolitis /LNH.

Downloaded from  http://www.wfubmc.edu/News-Releases/2006/Wake_Forest_Researcher_Warns_Against_Making_Connection_Between_Presence_of_Measles_Virus_and_Autism.htm  on January 22, 2011. \r\n \r\n Wake Forest Researcher Warns Against Making Connection Between Presence of Measles Virus and Autism  6/1/2006 \r\n WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. \u2013 An American scientist whose research replicates a connection published in England in 2002 between the measles virus and bowel disease in autistic children strongly warns against making the \u201cleap\u201d to suggesting that the measles vaccine might actually cause autism. \r\n \u201cThat is not what our research is showing,\u201d said Stephen J. Walker, Ph.D., an assistant professor of physiology and pharmacology at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. Walker and colleagues have issued an abstract to be presented at this week\u2019s International Meeting for Autism Research, indicating that a high percentage of autistic children that they have tested with chronic bowel disease show evidence of measles virus in their intestines. \r\n Some observers have said that the presence of the measles virus indicates a strong possibility that the measles vaccine, a possible source of the virus, could have caused the children\u2019s autism. That possible connection has caused a major controversy in the United Kingdom, where the connection was first made in 2002. The vaccine is first given as part of a triple vaccine called MMR \u2013 for measles, mumps and rubella \u2013 at ages 12-18 months. That is shortly before a particular type of autism (regressive) begins to appear in children afflicted with the condition, which has fueled the speculation about a connection. \r\n Walker says the new research does not support the connection, and he notes that the results have not even been published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cEven if we showed association (between measles virus and bowel disease) and we published it in a peer-reviewed journal, the conclusion will be simply that there is measles virus in the gut of a large number of children who have regressive autism and bowel disease. End of story. \r\n \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything to demonstrate that the measles virus is causing autism or even causing bowel disease.\u201d \r\n Walker explains that exploring the causes of chronic bowel disease in autistic children is the major impetus for his research. \u201cThere are lots of viruses in the gut, and any one of them could be causing inflammation. If it truly is from a vaccine and this virus causes inflammation and a chronic bowel condition in some susceptible children, then that\u2019s something that needs to be known.\u201d \r\n The main task at hand, Walker said, is to determine what is causing the bowel condition in the autistic children, a condition that has a direct influence on cognitive and behavioral issues associated with autism. \r\n A high percentage of autistic children have chronic bowel disease, a discovery in the late 1990s that eventually led to the measles virus connection. \r\n \u201cIf anybody has severe GI problems, it causes problems with focus, it causes problems with everything. You can\u2019t do anything until you get that resolved. We\u2019ve all experienced that. \r\n \u201cThese kids experience it hour after hour every single day of their lives. Many of them are non-verbal so they can\u2019t tell anybody what the problem is, and the behavior that they exhibit as a result of a severe stomach ache was once attributed to just being autistic and having weird behaviors \u2013 for example, leaning over the sharp edge of a coffee table for hours at a time. That seems weird, but what they\u2019re doing is relieving pressure on their lower abdomen.\u201d \r\n Walker said that relieving the bowel discomfort has been shown to improve other conditions associated with autism, such as cognition and the ability to learn. \u201cThere\u2019s case after case where kids improved cognitively, behaviorally and biomedically when you treat the bowel disease. There is a great improvement from better nutrition alone. You see improvements in their overall condition.\u201d \r\n Walker said he will continue to look for possible causes, the biological mechanism, and new treatments of the bowel condition. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal for me: understanding the biology of what\u2019s causing the disease and then gaining insight into the most effective way to treat it, so that clinicians will not have to go through a trial and error approach.\u201d \r\n # # # \r\n Media Contacts: Mark Wright, mwright@wfubmc.edu, Karen Richardson, krchrdsn@wfubmc.edu, or Shannon Koontz, shkoontz@wfubmc.edu, at (336) 716-4587. \r\n Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center is an academic health system comprised of North Carolina Baptist Hospital and Wake Forest University Health Sciences, which operates the university\u2019s School of Medicine.

(Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 634A-35A.) \r\n page 64-65 \r\n c.  The Walker study \r\n Petitioners have also relied on a study that is currently in progress, conducted by Dr. Hepner and several others, often described as the \u201cWalker study.\u201d  (See Ex. 59, Tab K; P. Trial Ex. 3.) Dr. Hepner stated that the \u201cpreliminary data\u201d from that study \u201cpresent another step in support\u201d of the proposition that the measles virus persists in the intestinal tissue of some autistic children.  (Ex. 63, p. 5; see also Tr. 634A-35A.)  After consideration of the Walker study and the testimony about it in the record of this case, however, I conclude that the study does not provide any substantial support to the proposition that the measles virus persists in the bodies of Michelle Cedillo or any other autistic individuals. \r\n Dr. Hepner reported that she and three other researchers--Steve Walker, Jeff Segal, and Dr. Arthur Krigsman, the latter being another of petitioners\u2019 experts in this case--are engaged in a study similar to the Uhlmann study, in that their objective is to perform PCR testing for the detection of measles virus on intestinal biopsies of children with both developmental delay and gastrointestinal symptoms.  (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 634A-35A.)  Dr. Hepner stated that the researchers generated \u201cmultiple primer sets\u201d and \u201ctested them for their specificity and sensitivity\u201d in identifying the presence of measles virus.  (Tr. 635A; Ex. 63, p. 5.)  Dr. Hepner and Dr. Krigsman testified that the study, which began in 2003, is not yet complete, but that the group conducted some initial testing and presented \u201cpreliminary data\u201d from the study at an autism-related conference in 2006, in the form of a \u201cposter presentation\u201d (literally, a poster board describing the study was set on an easel at the conference). (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 474A-75, 634A.)  Dr. Hepner reported that of 82 biopsy samples tested in the study\u2019s initial testing, which all came from children with both \u201cdevelopmental delay\u201d and \u201cGI [gastrointestinal] symptoms,\u201d 70 tested positive for measles virus.  (Ex. 63, p. 5.)  She further stated, without explanation, that her group was able \u201cto confirm vaccine strain specificity\u201d in some of the positive samples.  (Tr. 635A.) \r\n Petitioners, in their post-hearing briefs, have relied on the Walker study as supportive of their view that the Unigenetics measles virus testing should be considered reliable.  (P1, pp. 141, 154-55, 242; P3, pp. 33-34.)  After full consideration, however, I cannot agree. First, two of respondent\u2019s experts, Dr. Ward and Dr. Bustin, each pointed to a number of flaws in the Walker study, based on the description in the poster presentation.  (Tr. 1861-65; 1952A- 59A.) \r\n Moreover, a second important reason to discount the Walker study is the testimony of Dr. Hepner herself.  Dr. Hepner stated that the initial data from her study were only \u201cvery preliminary data.\u201d  (Tr. 659.)  She acknowledged that it would be inappropriate to \u201cdraw any conclusions\u201d from those preliminary results.  (Tr. 682.)  She acknowledged that her group at this time is still attempting \u201cto test this assay, to optimize the assay\u201d (Tr. 660A)--i.e., to develop the test to a point where they can then be confident that their test is yielding reliable results.  Part of developing any such test is to use \u201cnegative controls\u201d--i.e., to test samples that are known to be free of the target, to make sure that the test is not erroneously identifying the target in samples that do not contain it.  However, Dr. Hepner explained that her group is still at the point of developing their negative controls.  (Tr. 658, 681.) \r\n In short, Dr. Hepner was forthright in acknowledging that, in terms of drawing any conclusions with regard to the issue of the validity of measles virus testing, the preliminary data available from her study simply are \u201cnot useful at this time.\u201d  (Tr. 659.) In sum, it is clear that the Walker study must be disregarded.  First, both Dr. Ward and Dr. Bustin pointed out a number of reasons why one cannot draw any conclusions from, or place any reliance on, the preliminary data from the Walker study.  And even petitioners\u2019 expert Dr. Hepner, one of the study\u2019s own authors, has acknowledged that the preliminary data from the study are \u201cnot useful at this time.\u201d  (Tr. 659.)  Accordingly, I must agree with Dr. Hepner on this point.  I conclude that the Walker study is not useful in deciding the issue of whether the Unigenetics measles virus detection testing was reliable. \r\n p. 71 \r\n b.  The Walker study \r\n Petitioners also, in their final post-hearing brief in this case, pointed to another item of evidence in the record.  (P4, pp. 33-34.)  They pointed to the ongoing Walker study, discussed above, and note that one of their experts who has worked on that study, Dr. Krigsman, stated that in the study\u2019s initial testing, six specimens were determined to be positive \u201cfor vaccine-strain-specific RNA.\u201d  (Tr. 487A.)  However, as I have already discussed above, the preliminary data from the Walker study, in the words of the petitioners\u2019 own expert and co-author of that study, Dr. Hepner, is simply \u201cnot useful at this time.\u201d  (Tr. 659.)  Thus, again in Dr. Hepner\u2019s own words, it would not be appropriate for me to \u201cdraw any conclusions\u201d from that data.  (Tr. 682.) \r\n \r\n Selected abstracts from the Hazelhurst decision  ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/.../Campbell-Smith%20Hazlehurst%20Decision.pdf \r\n OFFICE OF SPECIAL MASTERS  E-Filed: February 12, 2009  No. 03-654V \r\n P. 148-149 \r\n \r\n I. The Preliminary Findings of the Walker Study \r\n Petitioners also rely on unpublished findings of measles virus in tested bowel tissues taken from autistic children as support for their claim regarding measles persistence.  Petitioners\u2019 expert Dr. Hepner expressed the opinion that the published 2002 Uhlmann findings are \u201creliable,\u201d see Cedillo Tr. at 639, and her confidence in the reported positive findings of measles virus is bolstered by the preliminary findings of a study on which she is working.  Dr. Hepner discussed her current work with a team of investigators in the laboratory of Dr. Stephen Walker at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  Dr. Hepner described the project as a study \u201cto create a highly reproducible, highly sensitive, very specific . . .  experimental design to detect [measles virus] RNA in the bowel biopsies of ASD patients.\u201d  Id. at 634A-635A.  She stated that the preliminary findings of the study, which were presented as an abstract at the June 2006 International Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR), confirm the presence of vaccine strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested.  Id. at 635. \r\n Dr. Hepner stated that while positive controls (specifically \u201can artificial laboratory construct\u201d of wild-type measles virus) have been run in each experimental run in the study, no negative controls have been run to date because the investigators are still looking for suitable negative controls.  Id. at 658, 663, 674-675.  The experimental controls are patients who do not have ASDs but have gastrointestinal symptoms.  Id. at 675.  The experimental group includes ASD patients who have \u201c[inflammatory bowel disease]-like symptoms, but not all of whom have received the MMR vaccine.\u201d  Id. at 676.  She described the preliminary results of the experiments as \u201ca technical achievement\u201d because the investigators \u201cbelieve that they have developed some assays to detect [measles virus] in this cohort of patients in biopsied tissue that is vaccine strain specific.\u201d  Id. at 682.  But Dr. Hepner declined to \u201cdraw any conclusions about the biological significance\u201d of the investigators\u2019 findings.  Id. \r\n However, respondent\u2019s expert Dr. Bustin expressed some concern about the preliminary PCR results reported in the Walker abstract presented at the IMFAR conference and discussed in Dr. Hepner\u2019s testimony.  Dr. Bustin\u2019s chief concern after reviewing the slides from the poster presentation is that there is evidence from the location of the bands in the experimental gel that the obtained results are not specific for the intended target.  See id. at 1955A-1958A.  Because the experiment did not include a negative control, a proper determination of what the observed bands show cannot be made. See id. at 1958.  In the absence of both positive and negative controls during a PCR run, Dr. Bustin stated that he \u201c[could not] have any confidence\u201d in the test results.  Id. at 1959A. \r\n The testimony during the Cedillo hearing of the parties\u2019 experts, Dr. Hepner for petitioners and Dr. Bustin and Dr. Ward for respondent, made clear that standard laboratory practice requires that positive samples (that always contain the targeted material), negative samples (that never contain the targeted material), experimental samples (the subjects with an exposure of interest tested for the presence of the targeted material), and control samples (the subjects without the exposure of interest tested for the presence of the targeted material) are run during each experiment.  See Cedillo Tr. at 620A, 621A, 627A, 677 (Dr. Hepner); id. at 1842 (Dr. Ward); id. at 1959A (Dr. Bustin). The use of the positive and negative controls provides information about the internal consistency of the experiments.  Informed that test results without the use of these controls during PCR experiments may not be reliable, the undersigned cannot place much weight on the preliminary findings of Walker study (addressed by petitioners\u2019 experts Drs. Corbier, Hepner, and Krigsman), specifically the alleged findings of vaccine-strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested. \r\n pp 175-176 \r\n Petitioners\u2019 claim that the measles virus can persist in the gut of certain vaccinated children and cause inflammation is based on reported findings of persistent measles virus in the biopsied gut tissue taken from autistic children who have received the MMR vaccine and developed gastrointestinal symptoms.  Petitioners\u2019 reliance, however, on the published reports of positive test results, the unpublished positive findings of the preliminary Walker study, and the positive lab results obtained by Unigenetics lab from biopsied gut tissue taken from children involved in the OAP litigation is unavailing.  Strong evidence, including highly credible expert testimony, indicates there were numerous irregularities in the testing procedures.  Those irregularities compromised the integrity of the conducted tests and have rendered the test results unreliable.  Underscoring the unreliability of the test results is the inability of other laboratories (that is, accredited laboratories not affiliated with either Dr. Wakefield, his colleagues, or the Unigenetics lab) to replicate the reported findings in gastrointestinal tissues or blood cells. \r\n Petitioners\u2019 theory is based on the characteristics of the wild-type measles virus rather than on the characteristics of the attenuated vaccine-strain measles virus. Petitioners\u2019 theory is further based on unreliable reports of positive measles findings.  The bases for petitioners\u2019 theory that the measles component of the MMR vaccine can lead to the development of autism are unsound.  Petitioners have failed to offer reliable support for the proposition that the MMR vaccine can cause autism and have failed to meet their burden of proof under the first prong of the Althen standard. \r\n \r\n Selected abstracts from the Hazelhust appeal,\u00a0 http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=in%20fco%2020100513188.xml&docbase=cslwar3-2007-curr \r\n downloaded January 24 2011 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n The Hazlehursts also argue that the special master disregarded critical evidence regarding the reliability of the Walker group's test results, in violation of the Vaccine Act's requirement to consider \"all . . . relevant medical and scientific evidence.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(b)(1). They assert that the special master ignored evidence\u2014 including testimony from Dr. Hepner and exhibits from the Walker group's 2006 IMFAR poster presentation\u2014showing that the Walker group used genetic sequencing to verify its test results. If the special master had given that evidence proper consideration, the Hazlehursts argue, she would have found that the Walker study reliably detected persistent vaccine-strain measles virus in the bowels of autistic children. The Hazlehursts therefore assert that the special master's decision to accord little weight to the Walker group's test results was arbitrary and capricious. We disagree. \r\n As an initial matter, even if the special master had made no explicit reference to the evidence that the Walker group used genetic sequencing, we would presume that she considered that evidence. See Medtronic, Inc. v. Daig Corp., 789 F.2d 903, 906 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (\"We presume that a fact finder reviews all the evidence presented unless he explicitly expresses otherwise.\"). In this case, however, it is not necessary to rely on that presumption, as the special master's opinion specifically refers to that evidence. Discussing Dr. Krigsman's testimony, the special master explained: \r\n Dr. Krigsman stated that the preliminary findings of that [Walker group] study show that based on the obtained PCR results, measles virus is present in the biopsied gastrointestinal tissue taken from patients with autism and bowel disease and examined by Dr. Krigsman. Dr. Krigsman acknowledged, however, as did Dr. Hepner, that not all of the samples had been sequenced for vaccine strain measles. \r\n Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *139 (citations to exhibits and testimony omitted). Thus, the special master clearly understood the testimony that some, though not all, of the Walker group's samples were sequenced to confirm vaccine-strain specificity. Moreover, the exhibits that the special master cited in her opinion included the June 2006 IMFAR abstract and IMFAR poster presentation\u2014the very documents that the Hazlehursts contend were \"ignored.\" We thus cannot conclude that the special master failed to consider the evidence in question, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(b)(1). \r\n In any event, an examination of the cited exhibits and testimony reveals inconsistent and preliminary data that provides only minimal support for the petitioners' claim that the Walker group confirmed the presence of vaccine-strain measles virus, as opposed to wild-type measles virus. While the abstract states that \"PCR analysis on. . . tissue from an initial 82 patients showed that 70 (85%) were positive\" for measles virus, the poster presentation states that \"PCR analysis on . . . tissue from an initial 86 patients showed that 57 (66%) were positive\" for measles virus. With respect to sequencing, the abstract observes that \"[f]ourteen [samples] have been verified by DNA sequence,\" but it does not state whether the sequencing was vaccine-strain specific. The poster presentation, on the other hand, states: \"Thirty five [samples] have currently been verified by DNA sequence. Six of the thirty five MV [measles virus] positive [samples] bear sequence that is specific to vaccine strain MV.\" That information, which suggests that only a small number of samples were successfully sequenced for vaccine-strain measles virus, is confirmed by Dr. Krigsman's testimony: \"All we could say at the time of this poster is that, as far as vaccine-strain-specific sequencing positivity, a total of six specimens [] were positive . . . . So genetic material that was specific for vaccine-strain measles virus was positive in six.\"[ 3 ] Given that the Walker group's data reflects only a small amount of vaccine-strain-specific sequencing, it was not inappropriate for the special master to include only a brief discussion of the Walker group's sequencing efforts in her opinion. \r\n The special master's decision to accord little weight to the Walker group's data was largely based on the study's other shortcomings and was thus well within her discretion in weighing the evidence. Most significantly, the special master found that the Walker group's research was unpublished, preliminary, and incomplete. Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *124-25, *139, *150. Embodied only in a poster presentation, the Walker study was not subject to peer review and therefore has not been subjected to scrutiny from the greater scientific community. See id. at *16, quoting Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 594 (1993) (\"The fact of publication (or lack thereof) in a peer reviewed journal thus will be a relevant, though not dispositive, consideration in assessing the scientific validity of a particular technique or methodology.\"). In fact, Dr. Krigsman and Dr. Hepner repeatedly described the Walker group's data as \"partial\" and \"preliminary.\" As the special master observed, Dr. Hepner testified that she \"certainly wouldn't draw any conclusions about the biological significance\" of the Walker group's test results at that early stage. In particular, Dr. Hepner noted the lack of a \"proper control source\" of tissue samples from children without autism spectrum disorders. She explained that the Walker group's current data does \"not give us any information yet about this cohort of patients relative to a different cohort of patients.\" \r\n The special master also expressed misgivings about the Walker group's use of controls in its study. The special master noted that \"while positive controls (specifically `an artificial laboratory construct' of wild-type measles virus) have been run in each experimental run in the study, no negative controls have been run to date because the investigators are still looking for suitable negative controls.\" Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *125. In their reply brief, the Hazlehursts dispute the special master's statement that \"no negative controls have been run.\" They argue that negative \"technical\" controls were run with every sample to check for contamination and to assure the reliability of the PCR testing, even though the Walker group lacked certain \"experimental\" controls, namely, control samples of tissue from children who tested negative for autism. \r\n The record is unclear as to precisely what negative controls were run. Although Dr. Hepner testified that \"no-template negative controls\" were run \"as a control for contamination,\" she also stated that the Walker group was still \"in the process of procuring samples that would be appropriate negative controls.\" She further noted that \"the negative control at this point generally has been a no-template control because we don't have access to the right material.\" The confusion is compounded by Dr. Bustin's testimony that he could not rule out the possibility of contamination\u2014suggested by several indicators of unidentified genetic material in the Walker group's poster presentation\u2014because \"there's no negative control there.\" \r\n What is clear from the record is that, at the time of the omnibus autism hearings, certain key controls used by the Walker group were incomplete and in flux. Most critical is the undisputed lack of a sufficient control group of non-autistic children with which to compare the positive findings in autistic children. If the Walker group were to find persistent measles virus at comparable rates in both autistic and non-autistic children, for example, such a finding would significantly undermine the petitioners' theory that persistent measles virus contributes to the causation of autism spectrum disorders. Moreover, Dr. Hepner's testimony suggests that the Walker group was also seeking a different type of positive control to rule out the possibility of cross-contamination. That evidence further underscores the preliminary and unconfirmed nature of the Walker group's results. \r\n Like the Court of Federal Claims, we do not believe that the Walker group's small amount of vaccine-strain-specific genetic sequencing \"carries enough weight to overcome the special master's conclusion that the Walker group's results were preliminary, unpublished, and not entitled to substantial weight.\" Hazlehurst, 88 Fed.

{"date": "Tuesday, February 22, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Sunday I put up a post about  the one-day bookbuying event  for Paul Offit's  Deadly Choices .\u00a0 Since Dr. Offit has donated the royalties from  Deadly Choices  to  The Autism Science Foundation , it was in effect a benefit for ASF. \r\n Michelle Dawson , a person with autism, an autism researcher, and a noted critic of all autism organizations that do not include people with autism in their leadership,  posted the following yesterday afternoon: \r\n Autism Science Foundation has, for nearly 2 years, deliberately excluded autistic people from its leadership. While (apparently) a lot of people see this as reason to support and promote ASF, I do not see how this can help autistics, or anyone else. \r\n The commenter known as Broken Link responded with \r\n Michelle, In an ideal world (which doesn't exist), there would be equitable representation. People with ASD would be a majority in all the organizations with a vision is to support autism and science. But it's not an ideal world. I have no idea how many people are full-time employees of the Autism Science Foundation. But I imagine that it's not thousands. Maybe 10's? Statistically speaking, they might have needed 100's of employees to randomly get one person with ASD. Of course, they should be proactive and seek out people who could speak to their core motivation. When you say people with ASD have been deliberately excluded, do you mean that you know people with ASD who have tried to gain employment with ASF, and have been rejected? \r\n An anonymous commenter wrote:  \r\n Number of ASF employees? Many many fewer than you would think.  \r\n This morning, Michelle Dawson wrote: \r\n In response to Broken Link, I didn't mention employees. I did mention leadership. A major autism funding body which publicly excludes autistics from its leadership is practicing and promoting bad science and bad ethics. Also, if ASF is structured such that ASF does not attract a lot of autistic people wanting to be in visible leadership positions (setting priorities, standards, etc), then ASF is in deep trouble, both scientifically and ethically. Finally, ASF is setting an example to employers, schools, families, communities, governments, etc. Why should employers (etc) see autistics as having something to contribute, when a leading autism organization (claimed to be science-based) very publicly does not? Maybe someone could explain to me why ASF's decision to publicly exclude autistics from its leadership is such a good thing. \r\n Broken Link responded with: \r\n Michelle, Sorry, I misread your comment. Indeed, there are no declared autistics in the leadership of ASF:  http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/leadership.html  The leadership consists of the two founders, an attorney, Paul Offit, and the scientific advisory board consists of active researchers in autism. Yes, it would indeed be great if there were people with autism in some of these positions. Can you direct me to some evidence that autistics have been \"publicly excluded\"? Can it simply be that none have expressed interest? I would think that besides yourself, autistics holding autism research positions must be quite rare. And that's not a good thing either. \r\n So. Must every autism organization have autistics in leadership positions?  Discuss. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Deadly-Choices-Anti-Vaccine-Movement-Threatens/dp/0465021492/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1298399205&sr=1-1", "http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/home.html", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/leadership.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/02/autism-organizations-and-autistics-in-leadership-positions.html", "title": "Autism Organizations: Where are the Autistics in Leadership Positions?"},

A diagnosis of autism is made using the DSM-IV criteria; a person must exhibit\u00a0  enough  of  the criteria to recieve an autism diagnosis.  I like Orac's two examples :\"  This is akin to arguing that anyone who has a belly ache or  diarrhea must have irritable bowel syndrome or that someone who  experiences a headache must have migraines.\" \r\n \r\n Of the more than 2,500 individuals who have been compensated for vaccine injury, 83 have autism (using the authors unique understanding of autism)   \r\n \r\n This too is an astonishing and counter-factual claim. The method they used was to comb through the  all \u00a0 cases of  vaccine injury compensated through March 3, 2011  (according to the footnote on page 522), in the years 1989 to 2011.\u00a0 Of  those cases (which the authors estimate as \u201d\u2026 approximately two  thousand five hundred; the actual number as of May is 2,664).\u00a0 \r\n From that  search\u00a0 identify  \u00a0  Using their unique understanding of \"autism\", Holland et al. claim that 83 individuals have been compensated for vaccine injury that includes autism (see table on pp   combed through  all \u00a0 cases of  vaccine injury compensated through March 3, 2011  (according to the footnote on page 522), in the years 1989 to 2011.\u00a0 Of those cases (which the authors estimate as \u201d\u2026 approximately two thousand five hundred; the actual number as of May is 2,664).\u00a0 From that search\u00a0 identify\u00a0 83 individuals where compensation\u00a0 cases, stretching from 1,. During this time, according to the authors, the VICP had\u00a0 compensated vaccine injury claims.\u201d The footnote mentions that this number was checked on 3 Mar 2011. When I checked (17 May 2011), there were 2,664 compensated claims. According to the VICP, at the end of 2010, there had been 2,524 compensated claims.  The authors\u2019 figure lacks the precision available.  Second, because they base  this  estimate primarily on children for whom  there are reports of   \u201cautistic-like\u201d symptoms or who ultimately  developed autism, they argue   that there is no difference between  autism and having been noted to   exhibit \u201cautism-like\u201d behaviors or  symptoms. \r\n \r\n Finally, they claim that   this means that autism is three times more prevalent in VICP-compensated   children than in the general population. Let\u2019s look at these one at a   time. \r\n \r\n The \"83 cases\" \r\n The article\u2019s authors are: \r\n Mary Holland, a lawyer who wrote the chapter defending Andrew Wakefield in the recent book  Vaccine Epidemic ;   Louis Conte, the father of two boys he believes are vaccine injured  and  the former director of something called the \u201cVaccine Injury   Compensation Program Justice Project\u201d; Robert Krakow, who is an attorney   who represents clients who have filed Vaccine Court claims and who has   filed his own claim on behalf of his son; and Lisa Colin, one of   Krakow\u2019s colleagues. \r\n About the Pace Environmental Law Review: \r\n \r\n Established in 1982, the Pace Environmental Law Review (PELR) was one  of the first scholarly journals in the then-new field of environmental  law. It is run and edited by Pace Law School JD candidates. \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=12610", "http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/742471", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/05/when-the-science-fails-you-turn-to-the-legal-option/", "http://blogs.plos.org/thepanicvirus/2011/05/09/the-latest-claims-of-proof-that-vaccines-cause-autism-will-the-media-take-the-bait/#comment-1235", "http://blogs.plos.org/thepanicvirus/2011/05/10/and-the-winner-is-fox-news/", "http://autism.about.com/b/2011/05/10/update-on-vaccine-court-publication-raises-questions.htm", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/05/another_swing_for_the_fences_and_a_miss.php", "http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/1671", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/05/study-by-nyu-and-pace-another-failure-in-obtaining-ethical-approval/", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=216", "http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statistics_report.htm#statistics_report", "http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statistics_report.htm#statistics_report"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/05/critiques-of-h0lland-et-al-unanswered-questions.html", "title": "Critiques of Holland et al., Unanswered Questions From The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program"},

{"date": "Monday, July 11, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Before we start: Some of this post touches the case  on a girl  who was born in 1998, who likely had a pre-existing, genetic condition -- a  mitochondrial disorder. \u00a0 In the  Vaccine Court  ( more here for beginners  )--but not, perhaps in areas with higher standards of evidence--the girl's maladies were found to be a result of\u00a0 vaccination.\u00a0  \r\n What is clear: this child continues to have severe and multiple challenges, relative to health, physical, and cognitive function. Not only has this girl -- now a teen--been suffering, her parents and other family members have been suffering as well. As for every family with such challenges, I am deeply sympathetic to this child's suffering and life limitations. \r\n That does not mean I cannot or should not challenge any family member's\u00a0  narrative  about the  cause  of those challenges. \r\n What is important here: the author of the opinion piece is that girl's great-aunt, and has a specific view, not grounded in research or science, that vaccines may be causal in autism or may have more risks than benefits. \r\n The article by Margaret Dunkle claims \" We don't know enough about childhood vaccines \"\u00a0 \r\n The mendaciousness starts with the headline, the deck, and the byline.\u00a0 (Keep in mind that the author of a given newpaper article isn't responsible for the headline or deck -- but is responsible -- for the most part -- for his or her bio.) \r\n \u00a0     with the claim, \"we don't know enough about childhood vaccines\" and the vague assertion that the author is a \"researcher\".\u00a0 \r\n Margaret Dunkle is a very accomplished woman, but not in the area of vaccinology or vaccine safety.\u00a0 She has a batchelor's degree in psychology, and appears to have spent the 1970s and 80s as an advocate for women's equality, especially in athletics. She also has\u00a0 an interest in gender equality in school health programs. Later, her professional focus turned to the coordination of services for children with disabilities, and establishing early developmental screenings for children -- especially low-income children -- who might be at risk for developmental delays. \r\n While her faculty page lists her areas of expertise as \r\n \r\n Civil Rights \r\n Health Disparities \r\n Public Policy \r\n Vaccine Safety \r\n \r\n I would say her accomplishments and publications make her an expert in vaccine safety in the same way I am an expert in vaccine safety. \r\n The following is the text of Ms. Dunkle's opinion piece.\u00a0 Her article is indented, in italics.\u00a0 My comments are in roman; quotes from others are indented in roman. \r\n \r\n The topics of vaccines and vaccine safety spark emotional outbursts at scientific meetings and family dinner tables alike. .... \r\n \r\n I don't doubt that there are emotional intra-family discussions; I've had a few of them myself.\u00a0 But Dunkle is mistaken, or disingeneous, to allege\u00a0 \"emotional outbursts\" at scientific meetings.\u00a0 The topic of vaccines and autism risk has been studied at length, with dozens of studies with hundreds of thousands of subjects.\u00a0 No increased risk for autism has been associate with vaccines.\u00a0 The overall subject of the safety of the recommended pediatric vaccines -- especially compared with the risks from the diseases they protect against -- is likewise not a topic that raises much interest, let alone \"outbursts\". \r\n \r\n But many of these debates are remarkably fact-free.  \r\n \r\n I highly doubt that discussions about vaccine safety in scientific meetings are \"fact-free\". \r\n \r\n Surprisingly few people \u2014 not just concerned parents but also doctors, policymakers and even immunization experts \u2014 can answer this seemingly simple question: How many immunizations does the federal government recommend for every child during the first two years of life? \r\n \r\n I am not sure of her point here.\u00a0\u00a0 If you stopped the average pediatrician in the street, I doubt she would be able to answer the question off the top of her head.\u00a0 I usually have to look it up and count to make sure I am remembering correctly.  Centers for Disease Control's recomendations   are available in multiple formats to prompt the memory of of health care providers and parents.  There's  even an iPhone app for parents  to help them keep to the schedule. \r\n \r\n The answer is important because most states, including Maryland, faithfully follow the recommendations of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, codifying CDC guidelines into requirements for children to enroll in school, kindergarten, preschool and child care. \r\n \r\n As if policy-makers can't be troubled to go to the CDC's website and print out any of many charts of the recommended vaccine schedules.\u00a0 Of  course  the states follow the CDC's recommendations -- they are formulated for the most public health. \r\n \r\n A new Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health study reports that the higher the proportion of infants and toddlers receiving recommended vaccines, the higher the state's rate of children diagnosed with autism or speech-language problems just a few years later. This analysis is sure to rekindle the debate about vaccine safety. \r\n \r\n Oh my. The \"study\" Dunkle is referring to is the deeply flawed paper written by Gayle deLong, an attorney, whose two daughters have autism.\u00a0 A list of articles detailing the paper's flaws are at the bottom of this post.\u00a0 The short answer is that the paper is so flawed that many question how it even passed peer review and came to be published. The DeLong paper is so weak that it\u00a0 does nothing to \"rekindle the debate\", and Ms. Dunkle should know that. \r\n \r\n For that conversation to produce useful results, we must start by defining terms. A \"dose of vaccine\" refers to each vaccine or antigen given to increase immunity against one specific disease. For chicken pox, a child receives one dose of vaccine through one shot. \r\n By contrast, an \"immunization event\" refers to each separate administration of a vaccine or bundle of vaccines \u2014 through a shot, orally, or nasally. The MMR shot for mumps, measles and rubella involves three doses of vaccine but is one immunization event. \r\n \r\n \r\n The critical number is how many doses of vaccine a child receives. Why? If a vaccine is strong enough to confer immunity against a disease, it is important enough to count separately. \r\n \r\n This passage reveals either Dunkle's ignorance, her bias, or both.\u00a0 The critical issue is not \"doses\" or \"immunization events\" but the number of antigens a child is exposed to through vaccination.\u00a0 If you are unclear on this (and many lay people are)\u00a0 I highly recommend the resources at the  History of Vaccines  project, specifically  How Vaccines Work. \r\n \r\n Clear definitions, analysis of CDC's \"General Recommendations on Immunization,\" and confirmation by Dr. Andrew Kroger, lead author of the definitive report on these recommendations, produce the answer to the not-so-simple-after-all question posed above. \r\n \r\n \r\n In all, the federal government recommends 36 doses of vaccine, addressing 14 different diseases, for every U.S. child under age 2. An on-schedule child will receive a dose of vaccine for hepatitis B at birth, eight doses of various vaccines at 2 months, seven additional doses at 4 months, and four to seven more doses at 6 months. \r\n Infants and toddlers receive these vaccine doses through 26 separate immunization events \u2014 mostly shots. If a child misses vaccinations because of illness or scheduling problems, following CDC's catch-up schedule usually results in extra doses at a later date. \r\n The federally recommended doses of vaccine for every child during the first two years of life are: three doses each for hepatitis B, polio, flu, and HIB (12 doses in all); two doses each for hepatitis A and rotavirus; four doses for pneumococcal infections; one dose for chicken pox; three doses through the combination MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella; and 12 doses through four separate administrations of the combination DTaP vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough). \r\n \r\n Put that way, it seems to be overwhelming.\u00a0 But why is the vaccine schedule the way it is?\u00a0 Readers might peruse  The Infection Schedule versus the Vaccine Schedule,  by infectous disease specialist  Mark Crislip . \u00a0 Dunkle's argument is just a of the \"too many, too soon\" argument that has been refuted, over and over again.\u00a0 \r\n Going back to antigens:\u00a0 children are exposed to fewer antigens in today's vaccines than they were in the past.\u00a0  The 1980s CDC schedule exposed children to over 3,000 antigens in the course of protecting against seven diseases; the 2000 recommendation exposed children to approximately 130 antigens inc the course of protecting against eleven diseases. \r\n How else could one state it?\u00a0 How about, \"the federally-recommended vaccine schedule protects infants and toddlers from 14 serious illnesses.\u00a0 Prevention of these illnesses has demonstrably improved individual or public health.\" \r\n \r\n Some infants and toddlers receive still more doses of vaccine \u2014 if they switch to pediatricians who use different \"combined\" vaccines, if they are at high risk for certain diseases, if lost or incomplete records lead to duplicate immunizations, and depending on the time of year they were born (for flu shots) or the brand of vaccine used. \r\n \r\n More fear-mongering in the \" too many, too soon \" vein, and hinting at the \" overwhelming the immature immune system \" ploy, which is demonstrably false. \r\n \r\n While testing is routine for individual vaccines as they are licensed, research on the both short- and long-term effects of multiple doses of vaccine administered to very young children during the critical birth-to-2 developmental window is sparse to nonexistent. \r\n \r\n First, the paragraph above is a variation on the \"too many, too soon\" gambit.\u00a0 Second,\u00a0 it is not quite true. In the course of vaccine development and after approval, vaccines are evaluated for safety, including post-marketing surveillance.\u00a0 as to the \"sparcity\" of research, one merely needs to read the references in  On-time Vaccine Receipt in the First Year Does Not Adversely Affect Neuropsychological Outcomes  to see that Dunkle is making much of little. \r\n \r\n In addition to the number of doses, vaccine ingredients can be problematic, especially for susceptible subgroups. First are adjuvants, substances added to boost effectiveness and allow smaller doses of vaccine antigen to be used. The most common adjuvant is aluminum, which is found in vaccines for hepatitis and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus. \r\n \r\n First -- Dunkle essays another foray into begging the question. What is the evidence for \"susceptible subgroups\"? Who are in those those subgroups, what are they susceptible to, and how do we know? \r\n Second -- oh no,  the toxins!!! gambit . \r\n Third -- aluminum as scary toxin,  Dr. Bob Sears' favorite bogeyman  to  move parents away from vaccination .\u00a0 Dunkle omits key facts, such as that aluminum (the third most common element on earth) is ubiquitous. It's even in breast milk, in far larger quantities than a child will recieve if vaccinated on the CDC schedule.\u00a0  \r\n \r\n Second are preservatives \u2014 such as thimerosal, which is 49.6 percent mercury. Thimerosal is still contained in many flu shots, although it was, except for trace amounts, removed from other child vaccines a decade ago. Many child vaccines (including those for diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, HIB, and hepatitis) contain formaldehyde, which was just added to the government's list of known human carcinogens. \r\n \r\n Why bring up thimerosal, which has been removed from all vaccines except some flu shots?\u00a0 Why not mention that thimerosal-free flu vaccinations available?\u00a0 Because Dunkle's aim in this essay is to repeat the anti-vaccine message that there are unsafe ingredients in vaccines.\u00a0 \r\n Then Dunkle emits another of the toxins!!! gambit --  formaldehyde .\u00a0 It certainly sounds vile -- it's used in embalming fluid, after all -- but she omits the fact that the body -- even babies' bodies--naturally produce formaldehyde at levels up to ten times the amount in a vaccine.\u00a0\u00a0  \r\n \r\n Third are ingredients to which some people have severe allergies: stabilizers such as gelatin, and eggs or other proteins that are used to prepare vaccines for flu, MMR, and other immunizations. \r\n \r\n Dunkle is partially correct.\u00a0 \"Some people\" are allergic to eggs and gelatin, which limits their access to the protections provided by the vaccines that are grown in eggs, or use gelatin as a stabilizer.\u00a0 But first, the percentages are very small.\u00a0 About 0.5% of people are allergic to eggs, and a somewhat larger percentage are allergic to gelatin.\u00a0 But here's where Dunkle gives away her true identity: she isn't a \"vaccine safety expert\" (or advocate), she's merely a garden-variety anti-vaccinationist.\u00a0 A true vaccine safety advocate would be advocating for change in vaccine manufacture.\u00a0 It's possible to make vaccines without growth in eggs; it's possible to find other stabilizers than gelatin.\u00a0 The manufacturers (given the small size of the at-risk population) need to be goaded into making the changes. \r\n \r\n The ongoing debate about vaccines and their safety needs to incorporate these basic facts as our country seeks to answer the critical Goldilocks question: Too many? Too few? Or just right? \r\n \r\n \"Needs to incorporate these basic facts\".\u00a0 As I have indicated, many of Dunkle's facts...aren't factual.\u00a0 The points Dunkle failed to make are the reasons for the recommended CDC vaccine schedule: the protection of children (and adults) from serious infectious disease with high risks of adverse outcomes.\u00a0 Dunkle completely ignored the relative risks of infectious disease compared to vaccination. \r\n The Baltimore Sun has in recent months done good work on exposing another set of anti-vaccine quacks, Mark Geier MD and his physician-imitating son David Geier.\u00a0\u00a0 It's a pity that the editorial board squandered that good work by approving Dunkle's flight of misinformation and spin. \r\n Update: also please read\u00a0  \r\n \r\n David Gorski MD at Science-Based Medicine  Antivaccine Propaganda in the Baltimore Sun \r\n Dr. Sandeep Rao at the Baltimore Sun   Misinformation about Vaccine Risks is Making Us Less Safe\u00a0  \r\n \r\n \u00a0 \r\n Sources \r\n \r\n Dunkle, Margaret.

{"date": "Friday, August 12, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t The BlogHer 11  Special Needs Mini Conference  ran on Friday August 5 2011 to 2:30 (ish).\u00a0 It was organized by Julia Roberts of  Kidneys and Eyes , who also founded and runs  Support for Special Needs . (Twitter:  JuliaRoberts1  and  SupportforSN ) \r\n The speakers were Aurelia Cotta, Robert Rummel-Hudson, and Shannon des Roches Rosa.\u00a0 \r\n There's a  list of issue affecting the attendee's speakers (including themselves ) \r\n What follows is a summary of each talk, with some but not all of the comments from the audience \r\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\r\nJulia Roberts, as\u00a0 organizer and moderator, was the first to speak. Part of her introduction was her story of  her son's mental breakdown , how his school reacted (with a desire for silence) and her family's rejection of the the school's attitude.\r\n The first speaker was AureliaCotta (twitter:  AureliaCotta  blog with backstory:  No Matter How Small ). \r\n Aurelia's talk was on why how blogging has been transformative for her; why she blogs and twitters pseudonymously; defending the right of folk to be pseudonymous online;\u00a0 how she discovered her own disability, ADHD, late in life; and how connecting with others online can be transformative. \r\n We then broke into small groups and discussed Aurelia's talk, and brought the larger discussion back to the group.\u00a0 The biggest point was protecting our children's privacy, if we blog under our own names; and autonomy for older children, if we blog under our own names or a pseudonym.\u00a0 There was a brief discussion of how to erase your blog presence from the internet (this is worthy of a separate post). \r\n The second speaker was Robert Rummel-Hudson, author of  Schuyler's Monster,  who blogs at  Fighting Monsters With Rubber Swords , and tweets as  @rumhud. \r\n The theme of his talk started out to be \"How to tell a story no one wants to hear\".\u00a0\u00a0 Robert mentioned his backstory -- his blog started out as a humorous look at new parenting, but transformed as Schuyler's disability -- a rare  brain malformation  that (most importantly in Schuyler's Monster) inhibits her ability to talk transformed him into something he never expected --a special needs parent.\u00a0 As he spoke, he developed four themes: \r\n \r\n The grieving every parent of a child with a disablity feels -- mourning the loss of the idealized child \r\n Representing your child as a whole, autonomous being, more than just her disability \r\n The absolute need for people affected by disability to band together, especially in this adverse political and social climate -- to shift the framing from entitlements or funding to civil rights. \r\n Developing your voice, personalizing the issues, so that people not affected by disability can hear, understand, and empathize with disability issues, so when it comes time for hard choices, that person sees another human being, not \"an issue\". \r\n \r\n Robert mentioned in particular the writings of  Jean Vanier.  From his writings, a world-wide network of intentional communities,  L'Arche International , has evolved. \r\n The final speaker was Shannon des Roches Rosa, who blogs at  Squidalicious , is the  BlogHer Contributing Editor on parenting special needs children,  and is the co-founder and co-editor of  The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism .\u00a0 She tweets as  @shannonrosa \r\n Shannon has  transcribed her talk at The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism (TPGA) \r\n In her talk, she described how we have built the community at TPGA.\u00a0 We can disagree, but it has to be with respect -- and what it takes to build that kind of vibrant community that allows conflict and disagreement within an envelope of respect. \r\n The discussion that followed had to do with building blog community and with building bridges.\u00a0 Some of the notable comments (I have cleaned up the speech dysfluencies and some of the spelling inaccuracies): \r\n \r\n Unidentified speaker : Our role as bloggers and public representatives for disability: When we hear from the naive: \"oh, how can you do that?\u00a0 You must be so strong\" -- that arises out of people's fear of having a disabled grandchild or a  disabled child.  We're their worst nightmare.  We have to make it less  of a nightmare--which all of our blogs do--but I want to say something about terminology.\u00a0 I really don't like the word \"disability\", I like capacity. I say we're all on this continuum capacity.\u00a0 \r\n Ellen  from  Love That Max : I write about fun things a lot of times.  I will write about, say, ten  things I will never program into Max's speech app, like \"Will you marry me,  Snooky?\"\u00a0  By doing that, I attract people or kids who are typical.  They  will read my posts then.  If they know I have a sense of HUMOR about it,  they will read, and help me spread the word.  So I think I  can write the most depressing blog in the whole wide word, but I think I  try to so a sense of humor and that helps keep my audience. \r\n Unidentified speaker from Massachussets : I'm on a school board. School board members deal primarily with a budget and  we get tax payers coming to us to complain.  I want to reinforce something that Robert  said about disability and advocacy and reaching out to  communities that maybe don't have a disabled child in their families or  anyone close to them. I get approached by  tax payers at least once a year.  They're usually older people that  didn't have the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or ADA legislation in their school days.  They frequently use word  \"before\".  Of course, one older gentleman did so on a day that I had a  particularly bad day with my special needs kid and I let him have it.  I  won't go into that except to repeat what I said: \"Our children are not burdens and  everyone's got issues.\" \r\n Robert Rummel-Hudson : When we talk about how much money goes into special education and all the things that we need, people talk about that money... It  makes me wonder, do people talk about the boulevards and bridges that don't  collapse as a burden?\u00a0 How about    if your house catches on fire or  if your community is hit by an earthquake? Are those \"burdens\"?\u00a0  I talk about shifting the  discussion of what our families and what our kids need to something  besides an economic budgetary issue. This idea of a \"burden\" -- we've all heard it; it can be the number one thing in discussions with our communities and with political leaders. I think that's number one attitude that has to somehow change.  \r\n Shannon des Roches Rosa : All those people who have this \"burden\" problem, I bet you 90% of them went to  public school.\u00a0 I say to them, you went to school.  You are the beneficiary of that investment in  you .  You are  seriously going to take that away there the people who come behind you?  \r\n Shannon des Roches Rosa :  You can tell people \"You invest in our kids when  they're younger.  It's a lot less expensive than it is to support them  as adults.  Our kids are good investment.\" \r\n Anita from  momsrising.org. :  Thank you.  It's a real honor to be here in this  particular session.... We have done a ton of advocacy around healthcare  and medicaid. We had a bunch moms  who shared\u00a0 their stories around, parenting with special needs children.\u00a0  We were able to take a group of mothers and children to\u00a0 the White House to share  their stories.  The mothers let senior White House  officials know the mothers, the families, wouldn't have made it without these programs. These officials are the people  making and influencing policy and they have no idea until they heard the  stories.. \r\n Sarah Gilbert  and I blog at  CafeMama. \u00a0 I have three special needs children whose condition causes are not known.\u00a0 I wanted to react  to the thing about advocacy.  I don't have energy for advocacy.  A lot of  times I just get so exhausted from advocating for my kids because what  I'm getting at school a lot of times is judgment and from other parents  and from the teachers and from the professionals.  And so I just get tired out.\u00a0 I'm not gonna fly to Washington and  tell my story.  I'm just gonna tell it, you know, where I am and for all  the people who say, you know, how is your kid ever going to get along  in society.  I'm like F*CK society.  Not that this is a bad kid or which  is a kid that's going to be successful.  I was voted most likely to  succeed in high school. I went and got an MBA, and worked on Wall  Street.  Now I sit at home and write and I know this is the success that  I wanted.  I don't go to an office.  I'm not on time for things.  So I  think kids can get along if we sit and change the expectation of what  success is.  Success doesn't mean $500,000 in an economic income and a Mercedes.   Success means being true and hopefully, um, not being a sh*t, though my  son is sometimes. \r\n Cheryl  from  abilitypath.org.  I wanted to thank everyone in this  room.  I've been in this field for 30 years.\u00a0 The things we see are  happening are bigger communities driving social change is because  of you here in this room.  The fact that you're telling your stories.   You're got people who are listening to your stories. A quick  success story! AbilityPath has been in direct services for 90 years, but we've been reading all of you for only about a year, to really hear what the emerging issues and are what really needs  to be addressed.\u00a0  What came up was bullying of special needs children.\u00a0  We ended up with a 60 page report  and also had a toolkit of what to do about it.  I was flying to New York  to be on CNN, to be on Good Morning America, and the producers called because\u00a0 they had kids with  special needs or a brother and sister.\u00a0  In California, there is now pending  legislature.  I have the ear of the state superintendant of California schools -- he called me to talk  to me about what he planned -- to work with every teacher in California is  to turn the bullying around.  So, the enormous power of building the community  and what we can do. \u00a0 I'm more hopeful than I have ever been and I'm  thankful because I know all those stories are painful to tell and by  doing that, that's how we'll make change. \r\n Unidentified speaker:  After Sarah spoke about how it's so hard and  she's too tired to advocate, I cannot tell you how often I've heard that  from people.\u00a0 Some the problem is --although I want to celebrate everybody  advocating for their children-- if that's criteria by which our kids get  help, then it will only be the special needs kids who are raised by the  wealthy, the educated, the literate, the white, the powerful, the  undisabled who get help.  The reality is not everybody can advocate for their  children and can advocate politically.  We have to find a way in the community to say,\u00a0 Look!  This mother is overburdened and we've all got to help her.   There's got to be some sort of way. We can't just keep  saying oh, we're going to fight this battle on our own.  We're all in it  together.  Thank you. \r\n \r\n Here's my Storify version of the tweet stream during the conference. \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n View \"The BlogHer11 Special Needs Mini Conference\" on Storify \r\n dot \r\n Here is

a  printed list of presenters -- with their names-- and some  words common  to the conversation, but uncommon in usual discourse.\u00a0  Some of the names are garbled, and the transcript is faithful

Parents that are interested should contact Maura Chatwell of  Stanford Autism Center at Packard's Childrens Hospital  via email:  chatwell@stanford.edu  or phone (650) 721-6327 \r\n Spanish-language translation will not be provided at the conference, but  Stanford Autism Center at  Packard's Childrens Hospital does offer Spanish-language autism services through  Parents Helping Parents. \r\n \r\n Press release: \r\n \r\n Autism Symposium April 2 at Stanford University, Sponsored by Packard Children's Hospital  \r\n STANFORD, Calif. \u2014An autism diagnosis raises big questions in parents' minds. Prominent among them: How do I talk to my child's doctors? Will I be able to communicate my family's needs? How will I make sure my son or daughter receives the right treatments? \r\n Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford is here to help parents find answers. On April 2, the hospital presents its Fourth Annual Autism Spectrum Disorders Update, an event that gives members of the community a chance to learn about new autism research and therapies. This year's theme, \"Bridging the Gap,\" puts the focus on parent-doctor partnerships. \r\n WHAT: \r\n Autism experts from Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, the Stanford University School of Medicine and across the country will give presentations on the  biology  of autism;  stem cells  and nascent autism therapies; building strong  relationships with your child's physicians ; improving  social communication  in children with autism;  medications  for autism spectrum disorder; and autism and  sleep problems . The day will conclude with break-out sessions where participants can interact with experts and get their questions answered. The complete program is online at  http://tinyurl.com/annual-autism-agenda   \r\n WHERE: \r\n Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center, Stanford University, 326 Galvez St., Stanford, Calif. Register online at  http://tinyurl.com/annual-autism-symposium . \r\n WHEN: \r\n Saturday,  April 2, 2011 , 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (Registration and continental breakfast begin at 7:45 a.m.) \r\n WHY: \r\n \"We hope parents will leave the symposium with new approaches for how to ask doctors and scientists for the information they really need,\" said Carl Feinstein, MD, director of the Center for Autism and Related Disorders at Packard Children\u2019s and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine. \"Doctors may know a lot about autism, but they may not always know all of the parents' concerns, or what their specific questions are. We want to help bridge that gap.\" \r\n The conference also provides parents, educators and caregivers with a rare opportunity to interact first-hand with the scientists who are advancing our understanding of the biology and treatment of autism, Feinstein added. \r\n \"We really want to reach out to parents,\" he said. \"At the Center for Autism, we believe that two-way communication between parents and experts is an essential part of providing the best care for children, teens and young adults with autism spectrum disorders.\" \r\n WHO SHOULD ATTEND: \r\n Parents, teachers, pediatricians, psychologists, caregivers, media and anyone with an interest in autism are invited to attend.

(Shan, Jen & I are co-founders and editors of  The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism .) \r\n Here's the deal: Sullivan had never met Shannon & Jennifer\u00a0 in real life before.\u00a0 It was kind of like a group blind date.\u00a0 It was great. \r\n We met at  Mudai , an outstanding Ethiopian restaurant in Silicon Valley.\u00a0 It helped that the food was really, really good and we were sharing dishes. \r\n And oh did we talk.\u00a0 Things about autism in childhood.\u00a0 Things food-related.\u00a0 We shared photos of our children (well, grandchildren in my case). Things about the broader autism community. \r\n It also helped that the four of us share a lot of values. \r\n So the moral(s) of this little post is: if you get a chance, meet your blog-friends and online acquaintances in real life.\u00a0 At a good restaurant.\u00a0 For lunch.\u00a0 You won't regret it. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://www.squidalicious.com/", "http://jennyalice.blogspot.com/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/", "http://www.mudairestaurant.com/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/03/when-you-introduce-friends.html", "title": "When you introduce friends..."},

You need to see this film. And if you want to help others better understand autism, you need to recommend Loving Lampposts to them. \r\n The segment I found most moving was the interviews (in the film itself, and the extended interview in the Extras) with Lila Howard, whose son Lyndon was born in the same year I was.\u00a0 It was all so different then -- Lila had to contend with the \"refrigerator mother theory\", the lack of supports, the lack of educational opportunities... She made it all happen.\u00a0 Indomidable is the word. \r\n Lyndon is living in his own apartment, with support from visiting staff. Yes he has challenges, but he is also living a life of dignity and satisfaction. \r\n You can buy the DVD through Amazon ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H4XDI6/ ) or download it from iTunes ( http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewMovie?id=421776921&s=143441  link opens iTunes Store). \r\n Eventually it will be available on Netflix, too,just not today. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2011/03/29/loving-lampposts-a-groundbreaking-documentary-about-autism-love-and-acceptance/", "http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Loving-Lampposts/70166285?strkid=305844720_0_0&lnkctr=srchrd-sr&strackid=3d6e63f3b256867a_0_srl&trkid=222336", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/03/loving-lampposts-accepting-and.html", "http://www.lovinglamppostsmovie.com/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H4XDI6/", "http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewMovie?id=421776921&s=143441"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/03/a-must-see-movie-loving-lampposts-1.html", "title": "A Must-See Movie: Loving Lampposts"},

Scroll down to read the response. \r\n On April 29, 2011 at approximately 2:30 PM PDT, Mr. Sullivan posted an apology to Mr. Handley.\u00a0 Scroll down to read. \r\n Remember back in November 2010,\u00a0 when crack investigator J.B. Handley claimed that he had proof that the blogger known as  Sullivan was really Paul Offit's wife Bonnie Offit ?\u00a0 The internet  laughed .\u00a0 In response, Mr. Handley went on to  make foul-mouthed and anonymous comments.\u00a0  \r\n Sullivan has decided to reveal his real-life name:\u00a0 \r\n \u00a0   \r\n as always, click to embiggen \r\n Remember what the crack researcher J.B. Handley claimed? \r\n   as always, click to embiggen \r\n Nope.\u00a0 Not Paul Offit or his \"Pediatrician wife\", but\u00a0 \"an industrial researcher in computer hardware\" and the father of a child with autism. The crack researcher was wrong about the \"hundreds of hours\" bit too.\u00a0 This is how wrong:\u00a0 Mr. Carey is presenting a poster at the International Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR) ,  Parent Reported Status and Expectations for Their Autistic Student Children: An Analysis of the 2007 National Household Education Survey  \r\n Remember what else J.B. Handley, the businessman, promised?\u00a0 I will remind you (and Mr. Handley): \r\n \r\n as always, click to embiggen \r\n So, Mr. Handley: time to make good on your offer  and\u00a0  your promise.\u00a0 Or be forsworn.\u00a0 Your choice. \u00a0 \r\n ==== \r\n Update:  Message from Sullivan: \r\n \r\n In case he\u2019s waiting\u2014here\u2019s an open message to Mr. Handley: Do you   intend to make good on your commitment, as stated in your blog post? \r\n  And, an open message to Dan Olmsted: You are editor of a blog  which has  a post in need of a correction.  I would greatly appreciate  it if you  were to post a correction to the Bonnie Offit post. \r\n \r\n Update: Post from Kev Leitch:  Sullivan Outs Himself \r\n Posts to date pointing out Mr. Handley's error, and requesting him to make good on his word: \r\n \r\n April 27, 2011, Sullivan at LeftBrain/RightBrain: Sullivan to Attend IMFAR \r\n April 27, 2011, Kev at LeftBrain/RightBrain: Sullivan Outs Himself \r\n April 27, 2011, Skepacabra: Sullivan Reveals He's Not Bonnie Offit and J.B. Handley Must Never Mention Paul Offit Again \r\n April 27, 2011, Harpocrates Speaks: An Outing at IMFAR \r\n April 27, 2011, Countering: Handley's Egg on His Face: I Bet He Doesn't Even Notice \r\n April 28, 2011, Respectful Insolsolence: Sullivan Outs Himself, or Time for J.B. Handley to Put Up or Shut Up About Paul Offit \r\n April 28, 2011, The Epi Times: Tic-Toc, Mr. J.B. Handley.. \r\n \r\n Mr. Handley's response:  \r\n \r\n Matt Carey, Ph.D. says he\u2019s Bonnie Offit (Just Kidding)  \r\n http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/04/matt-carey-phd-says-hes-bonnie-offit-just-kidding.html \r\n 5 months late, Matt Carey, a research staff member at Hitachi GST, with a PhD in physics from UCSD, has revealed himself to be the notorious blogger \u201cSullivan.\u201d \r\n In a previous post, I speculated that Sullivan was actually Bonnie Offit, wife of a not-to-be-mentioned vaccine millionaire. Mr. Carey\u2019s personal outing of himself renders my speculation incorrect. \r\n As many ravenous members of the dark side I\u2019m sure have mentioned, I also made a simple promise that if Sullivan was NOT Bonnie Offit, I would not utter said name of said leader of the Dark Side. \r\n I also offered to give up the website www.pauloffit.com \r\n Apparently, Mr. Carey is a parent of a child with autism. Matt, if you\u2019re reading this, note that I really have no interest in writing about or attacking other parents, and you can expect similar treatment. My enemies are the AAP, CDC, and the vaccine makers themselves, as well as their well-paid minions. Since you don\u2019t appear to be in any of those camps and have a kid just like me, I don\u2019t have the heart. \r\n If I live 5 lifetimes, I will never understand where your reverence for not to be named profiteer of vaccines comes from, or why you choose to use your precious time to defend him. \r\n I\u2019m also pleased to see you now blogging in your own name, as all AoA writers and parents do. I think it\u2019s a simple way to demonstrate courage, conviction, and integrity in the things you write. \r\n \u2018Nuff said, in the world I live in, a deal\u2019s a deal, even if you took five months to get here. Just email me, plenty on the dark side know how to find me, and we can work out the details. \r\n \r\n Mr. Carey's apology to Mr. J. B. Handley: \r\n \r\n As Kev points out I chose this week to out myself. The title for my talk at IMFAR has been posted online and it was time. As part of Kev\u2019s post, he noted that Mr. Handley made some commitments on condition that I step forward. I doubted that Mr. Handley would make good on his commitments, even going so far as to write that I didn\u2019t think he had the integrity to do so. For those comments I offer a sincere apology. I was wrong. \r\n On important point to make here. It wasn\u2019t JB Handley or a regular of the Age of Autism who outed me. It was former members of the autism hub blogs in the comments for the \u201cBonnie Offit\u201d piece by Mr. Handley. \r\n On the other hand, one person with whom I have disagreed over the years figured out my name long before any of this \u201cBonnie Offit\u201d mess. Rather than out me, that person emailed me with the information of how I was exposing myself. It is that person\u2019s integrity that is the biggest lesson I have learned from these events. \r\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/11/is-paul-offits-wife-internet-trollautism-father-sullivan.html rel=", "http://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2011/webprogram/Paper9678.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/04/parent-reported-status-and-expectations-for-their-autistic-student-children-an-analysis-of-the-2007-national-household-education-survey/#comment-163622", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/04/sullivan-outs-himself/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/04/parent-reported-status-and-expectations-for-their-autistic-student-children-an-analysis-of-the-2007-national-household-education-survey/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/04/sullivan-outs-himself/", "http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2011/04/27/sullivan-reveals-hes-not-bonnie-offit-and-j-b-handley-must-never-mention-paul-offit-again/", "http://silencedbyageofautism.blogspot.com/2011/04/outing-at-imfar.html", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2011/04/handleys-egg-on-his-face-i-bet-he.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/04/sullivan_outs_himself_or_time_for_jb_han.php", "http://blog.epiren.com/2011/04/tic-toc-mr-jb-handley.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/04/an-apology-to-mr-j-b-handley/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/04/now-it-can-be-revealed-sullivans-true-identity.html", "title": "Now it can be revealed: the blogger Sullivan's true identity!

Handley Makes Good on His Promise, Finally, Sort Of. \r\n Mr Handley also published his version of the whole issue, including the phrase,  \r\n looking for some reason to sully my reputation, \r\n No, Mr. Handley, your actions sullied your reputation -- you didn't need outside help. \r\n see blog post  http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/05/pauloffitcom-the-website-no-one-wants.html \r\n Update 5/14/2011: Mr. Handley claims to have fulfilled his end of the deal.\u00a0 He didn't.\u00a0 He is still forsworn.\u00a0 See below.\u00a0  \r\n     \r\n The best short response to J.B. Handley's claim to have fulfilled the deal?\u00a0  Andrew at Respectful Insolence \r\n \r\n I didn't break my promise to return your car - I left it unlocked on the street, so it's your own fault that someone took it. \r\n \r\n Remember, the deal was: \r\n \r\n I will make sure that the pauloffit.com website is given to you [Bonnie Offit] and your husband [Paul Offit MD] for good. \r\n \r\n A person of honor and integrity would have: \r\n \r\n Determined the steps for domain transfer \r\n Communicated the steps necessary for domain transfer to Dr. Bonnie Offit  and  Dr. Paul Offit, with sufficient back-and-forth communication to ensure all three parties (Handley and the Drs. Offit) were aware of the steps including any time limitations, and that the Drs. Offit were prepared to act on the transfer when it became actionable. \r\n Initiated the transfer at a time and in such a way that the Drs. Offit were ready and able to take possession of the domain name. \r\n Safeguarded the transaction\u00a0 in such a way that only the three parties to the deal were aware of the transfer. \r\n Safeguarded the transaction in such a way that the property (the domain name) could only come into the possession of the Drs. Offit. \r\n \r\n It is clear from Mr. Handley's communication (screenshot above of comment below) took  only the first  of those five steps. \r\n J. B. Handley is still forsworn.\u00a0 He did not keep his promise. \r\n Update #1 One of my readers reminded me privately that I had not explained that J.B. Handley had purchased the domain name PaulOffit.com in order to revile Paul Offit MD.\u00a0 This is commonly called \" cybersquatting, \" or purchasing a domain name in bad faith.\u00a0 This\u00a0 purchase is not Mr. Handley's first or only act of cybersquatting. It is a further indication of Mr. Handley's character. \r\n Update #2 A list of blog posts on the topic of the current ownership and content of PaulOffit.com is at the bottom of the post. \r\n Update #3 Screencaptures of the current contents of PaulOffit.com is at the bottom of the post \r\n Update #4: What Handley's supporters thought about his agreement to honor his word and transfer the PaulOffit.com domain name to Paul Offit  \r\n \u00a0 Last month there was the big reveal of Sullivan's real identity, as I discussed in  Now it Can Be Revealed: the Blogger Sullivan's True Identity -- Time for JB Handley to Make Good on His Promise . \r\n edited 5/14/2011 to add: \r\n \u00a0 Here is the promise J. B. Handley made, on November 16, 2010, in the blog post http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/04/matt-carey-phd-says-hes-bonnie-offit-just-kidding.html: \r\n (click image to see full size) \r\n   \r\n \u00a0 \r\n In response to Sullivan revealing that he was indeed Matthew J. Carey, Mr. Handley wrote, on April 29, 2011 \r\n \r\n ... I  also made a simple promise that if Sullivan was NOT Bonnie Offit, I  would not utter said name of said leader of the Dark Side. \r\n I also offered to give up the website www.pauloffit.com \r\n ....\u2018Nuff said, in the world I live in, a deal\u2019s a deal... \r\n \r\n \r\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\r\nFor a while, the website pauloffit.com had this image:\r\n   \r\n Which wasn't exactly keeping his promise, but was close enough (and humor counts). \r\n Now, the forsworn J.B. Handley (who still controls the website, apparently) has posted this: \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \r\n (click to embiggen) \r\n Forget that \"voted himself rich\" is the endless lie.\u00a0 \r\n J. B. has reneged on his deal.\u00a0 He is forsworn; he has demonstrated what his word is worth. \r\n Update: evidently the PaulOffit.com website has  not  been transferred to Paul Offit, as Mr. Handley promised to do.\u00a0 However, Handley, who used to control the website,  has granted someone named M. Wazowski editing privileges  Evidently I am clueless when it comes to Monsters Inc.  M. Wazowski is also a Monsters Inc. character.\u00a0  And  Mr. Handley has previously sneered at those who use pseudonyms for blogging. Handley has still gone back on his word. \r\n     \r\n Other blog posts about Handley's integrity and honor: \r\n \r\n May 12, 2011, ToddW at Harpocrates Speaks  Integrity and Honesty , which includes a comment from Paul Offit MD confirming that Mr. Handley made no attempt to contact Dr. Offit for ownership transfer of PaulOffit.com  \r\n May 12, 2011 Kim Wombles at Countering  J.B. Handley Backs Out of Agreement Regarding Offit Website\u00a0 \r\n May 12, 2011 Ren\u00e9 Najera at The Epi Times:  Quick Note: I Guess Honor Doesn't Stand for Much Anymore\u00a0 \r\n May 12, 2011 Leart Shaka at The Vaccine Times:  J.B. Handley and the Unkept Promise \r\n \r\n Responses from Age of Autism readers to Mr. Handley's post  http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/04/matt-carey-phd-says-hes-bonnie-offit-just-kidding.html, posted at 5:44 am on April 29, 2011 \r\n Mr Handley wrote at the link above: \r\n \r\n I\u2019m also pleased to see you now blogging in your own name, as all AoA  writers and parents do.

They labelled Leduc a\n\"diligent\" mother doing the best she could for her child under\ndifficult circumstances, closed the file and left, calling the report\n\"ridiculous.\" The school cannot keep Victoria safe by preventing her school elopement behaviors. The district has not provided intensive behavioral intervention.\u00a0 But responding to a psychic's allegations?\u00a0 Up to speed. \n\n No wonder parents of children in special education are often angry and frustrated. \n\n Update-- from the local paper:   The situation has aggravated Leduc on many levels.\n \n\n \"A, I don't believe in psychics. B, (Victoria) is not around\npeople who are those ages (mentioned by the psychic),\" she said. \"C,\nshe has GPS with a listen-in device. And D, it's an insult to me as a\nparent because I'm so diligent with her and who she's around.\"  More from the local paper With Victoria out of school, the stress level at home has been compounded.\n \n\n \"These children strive on structured days,\" Leduc said, adding\nher daughter is now more prone to emotional meltdowns, stimming\n(repetitive behaviour), as well as sleep and feeding issues.\n \n\n Leduc, who's on stress leave while she gets her daughter's life\nin order, met with school officials yesterday afternoon, but said the\nmeeting was \"a lot of fluff, about how we have to work together. I just\nsat and listened.\"\n \n\n No apology was offered, she added.\n \n\n \"The [local school] board has been very difficult to work with,\" Leduc said.\n\"Very uncooperative, very evasive.

An example: When we lived in San Francisco, our neighbor's phone went out. We were standing on the front porch of our adjoined homes talking about it. When she mentioned it, I said, \"Oh, that's too bad,\" thinking \"empathy, empathy\" and feeling rather proud of myself. But then Mr. DMFP, who's far better at this kind of thing, said, \"If you need to use our phone while you're waiting for them to repair it, just let us know.\" I almost smacked myself on the forehead, right there. Of course! That's the RIGHT thing to do. I filed it away:  When neighbor mentions loss of function of small appliances, phone, or other communication devices, offer use of your own version of said item.  That would be item #2,520 on the mental list. Emily points to  this list of social tips .\u00a0 #4 is particularly helpful: If a thought passes through your head and you have time to think to yourself, \u201cShould I say that?\u201d Don\u2019t. If you have to think about it, it\u2019s probably a sign from beyond that it\u2019s a bad idea.

Widespread use of the measles vaccine has dramatically reduced the incidence of the disease over the past four decades; in 2004, there were just 37 cases, the smallest number in nearly 90 years of record-keeping. \n\n The girl unknowingly brought the viral disease back to her home state of Indiana, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Thirty-two other people in Indiana and one from Illinois became infected. Three people were hospitalized, but no one died. \n\n Only two of the 34 people had been vaccinated against measles. \n\n \"The outbreak occurred because measles was imported into a population of children whose parents had chosen not to vaccinate their children because of safety concerns, despite evidence that measles-containing vaccine is safe and effective,\" the CDC said. \n\n The Indiana girl became infected after visiting a Romanian orphanage while on a church-mission trip, the CDC and state health officials said. The others became infected after they attended a church gathering with her the day after her return. \n\n \"Certainly orphanages are known to be higher risk\" for measles, said Dr. Philip Gould of the CDC's division of viral diseases. \"The main point is to ensure that people do get vaccinated, especially prior to leaving the country, ... going to a place that physicians suspect that measles is a risk.\" \n\n Nearly all of the 32 other U.S. cases in 2005 originated abroad, including 16 involving U.S. residents infected while traveling overseas and seven involving foreigners who were infected before visiting the United States. \n\n In the decade before a vaccine became available in 1963, about 450,000 measles cases and about 450 measles deaths were recorded in the U.S. each year. The disease - often characterized by a rash that begins on the face and spreads - can cause ear infections, diarrhea and pneumonia. It kills about one in 1,000 patients, according to the CDC. \n\n The U.S. vaccination rate against measles is now more than 90 percent \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.examiner.com/a-469222~CDC__1_girl_tied_to_more_than_half_of_U_S__measles_cases_in_2005.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2006/12/cdc_1_girl_tied.html", "title": "CDC: 1 girl tied to more than half of U.S. measles cases in 2005 - Examiner.com"},

(Examples:  Normal is Overrated ;  Whose Planet Is It Anyway ?; and most notably, the row over the 2006 video \"Autism Every Day\", well-summarized by  Mike Stanton .) \n\n Early in 2008,\u00a0 a teenager with autism made a parody of the Autism Speaks website, calling it NTspeaks.\u00a0 Autism Speaks  responded by threatening litigation , and the girl took the parody site down.\u00a0  \n\n\n\n \nThis month, Zach, who runs\u00a0  AspieWeb, created the tee-shirt pictured to the left,  which he planned to sell at the  AspieWeb store .\u00a0 Autism Speaks had a different idea: it contacted the firm that manages the store,  Zazzle.com , and demanded that the tee-shirt be removed from the product line.\u00a0  Zazzle.com complied, fearing litigation . \n\n Wrong Planet  wrote: Autism Speaks, which claims to\nspeak for autism, has no autistic employees or board members with\nautism and is viewed as a bully by many autistic individuals who feel\nthat the organization engages in tactics that marginalize their voices\nand contribute to an environment that hurts the lives of those with\nAutism. Their most recent move certainly supports such an argument.

{"date": "Monday, October 15, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Update: February 2010. Best's blog has been put behind a warning label by Blogger. \r\n November 23, 2013: Edited to add: this is in reference to  Kev Leitch shutting down his blog, LeftBrainRightBrain in October 2007 , because of threatening behavior by John Best \r\n I received a comment (see below) from a person whose email seems to be fraudulent. I'm posting the comment here, up front. My points are \r\n flush left in roman \r\n and \"hectorchavezhomieintel@aol.com\"'s comments are  \r\n indented and in italics \r\n My response \r\n Thanks for taking the time to comment. I'll take your points one by one. \r\n \r\n  I don't understand all the hate towards John Best. \r\n \r\n Perhaps you didn't notice that the post you commented on was from 2007. At that time, Mr. Leitch, whose daughter also has autism, was at that time 7 years old, non-verbal, and had several problematic behaviors. In other words, she had \"severe autism\". \r\n Mr. Best, in the months leading up to the post: \r\n \r\n Appeared at autism conferences using a nametag with Mr. Leitch's daughter's real name \r\n Encouraged others to mock Mr. Leitch's daughter \r\n Wrote blog posts purporting to be written by Mr. Leitch's daughter \r\n Made internet appeals for funds for treatment for Mr. Leitch's daughter, the funds to be sent to Mr. Best's home address. \r\n \r\n Sources for the above assertions: \r\n \r\n http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2006/10/too-far-attacks-on-autistic-peopl \r\n http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/10/hate-is-unmistakeable.html \r\n http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/10/loving-will-prevail.html \r\n http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/10/the_mercury_militia_silences_a_voice_of.php \r\n \r\n In Mr. Leitch's own words in the fall of 2006 \r\n \r\n John Best at AWARES \r\n John has developed what seems to be an unhealthy interest in my daughter. I find it incredibly disturbing. More so than I can possibly convey in writing. I don\u2019t give a stuff if he or his crowd insult me personally, I\u2019m a big boy \u2013 but time after time he has seen fit to abuse my daughter. Who can forget his charming comparison of my daughter to a trained monkey: \r\n \"My wife bought too many bananas so I;ll send some for your daughter\" \r\n which came about as a result of me detailing her progress (the crime being of course that she\u2019s progressing without chelation/ALA/megadose vitamins or HBOT). \r\n Well now he\u2019s stooped even lower. This year's AWARES conference is well under way. John has apparently changed his stance from last year where he stated that AWARES was a made up conference solely to trap him (John has a little problem with ego and reality) and decided to attend again this year. \r\n This time though he joined up with the username \u2018Megan Leitch\u2019 and made numerous posts abusing autistic members of the conference and pushing chelation as the only cure. When I was made aware of this, I contacted the conference administrator and after satisfying himself that what I was saying was true, he deleted all posts from that user and deleted the account. \r\n What sort of utter coward assumes the identity of a six year old autistic girl? I am in two minds at whether to follow up on this legally. I\u2019m not sure what constitutes identity theft in a legal sense but I intend to find out. But of course this goes far beyond identify theft. To anyone with an ounce of morality, posting in the name of a child to further your own agenda is so tasteless that I don\u2019t think there are adjectives to describe this particular act. Assuming the identity of an autistic child because you don\u2019t like the child\u2019s father or what he has to say is\u2026..disturbing\u2026. \r\n \r\n In the fall of 2007, Mr. Best upped his attacks on Mr. Leitch, using the voice of Mr. Leitch's daughter. As a consequence of these actions, Mr. Leitch felt he must close down his blog. \r\n Mr. Best's intemperate comments were well-known before the Leitch affair. A father of an autistic child collated some of Mr. Best's more objectionable statements here. I think you might want to read through the sections, here: \r\n http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/john-bests-greatest-hits.html \r\n \r\n  The man has a severly autsitic son you heartless thugs. \r\n \r\n I'd like to point out that of the folk repudiating Mr. Best's behavior on the blog post above, five have children who are \"severely autistic\": nonverbal or minimally verbal, some who still struggle with toilet training, some with self-injurious behaviors. \r\n \r\n  Yet, you hipocrites call him a thug?  \r\n \r\n Of those five bloggers (and others who blog) who have children severely affected by autism, none have threatened another blogger, or impersonated or mocked other children on their blogs. \r\n Mr. Best's behavior was beyond the bounds of civilized behavior. \r\n \r\n  He's the one targeted and abused by you all.  \r\n \r\n No, you are mistaken. No one would pay attention to John Best (or Foresam) if he did not repeatedly show up in blog comments using vile language and threatening others with harm. \r\n \r\n  Hey, man up or woman up whatever. This is USA, not North Korea folks, if you don't like what he says, defend your position or don't listen to him  \r\n \r\n I think that is exactly what the bloggers listed in this post in 2007, 2.5 years ago, and have continued to do. \r\n \r\n  but to go on a campaign to destroy his freedom of speech \r\n \r\n How is remonstrating with Mr. Best for his uncivilized, reprehensible behavior a \"campaign to destroy his freedom of speech\"? No one organized a campaign to have his blog (hate-spewing though it is) shut down. \r\n However, I think you might be referring not to this post from 2007, but the current situation. \r\n Best uses Blogger as his blogging platform. Earlier this week, Blogger briefly shut Best's blog down. It is back up, but now comes with a content warning. \r\n https://www.blogger.com/blogin.g?blogspotURL=http%3A%2F%2Fhatingautism.blogspot.com%2F \r\n I had nothing to do with Blogger's decision to first shut down, and then re-install with a content warning. \r\n \r\n says more about you than I cared to really believe. Now I will spread the word to all other parents of autistic children about how abusive and cowardly you people are for going after John Best. \r\n \r\n That is your perfect right. But again, I'd like to point out, if you are going to \"spread the word to all other parents of autistic children\" -- many of those parents, those who blog and don't agree with Best that chelation is the only way to \"recover\" children with autism -- are well aware of Best's heinous behavior. \r\n \r\n You owe th is man an apology. He's obviously under a lot of stress. \r\n \r\n If any apologies are owed, it isn't to Best \r\n \r\n People are aggressive when they are under stress and feel hopeless. \r\n \r\n Many of the autism parents that Best has verbally assaulted and abused are in the same boat as Best, but somehow they have had the integrity and dignity to refrain from verbal assaults and abuse. Some of Mr. Best's \"stress\" is self-imposed. \r\n Update: Best's  behavior constitutes cyberbullying . \r\n I have an internet friend I've never met in real life,  Kevin Leitch .\u00a0 I know he is a real person, through a number of sources.\u00a0 Until this weekend, he wrote the excellent blog  Left Brain / Right Brain .\u00a0 He is closing it because a moral midget named John Best is harassing his daughter, who has autism. \r\n \r\n The reason LB/RB is shutting  is because I cannot continue to allow my beautiful eldest girl to be exposed to the hatred and bullying she is recieving from John Best. John has seen fit to compare my beautiful child to a trained monkey because he didn't like the fact she was progressing. He has made numerous jokes at her expense on that theme. He has assumed her identity online. He has encouraged others to do the same. \r\n \r\n John Best also appears as \"Fore Sam\" in blog comments. \r\n I will miss Kev's commentary and especially his wonderful videos of his daughter. \r\n More expressions of regret from: \r\n \r\n Kristina Chew \r\n Skeptico \r\n Estee Klar-Wolfond \r\n Joseph of  Natural Variations \r\n Orac of Respectful Insolence \r\n The Bronze Blog \r\n The Voyage \r\n Living Healthy Centre (UK) \r\n One Dad's Opinion \r\n Odd Time Signatures  (Karoli's even more irate than I am) \r\n Club 166's tribute  to Kev \r\n \r\n If you'd like to see a sample of what passes for Best's thinking, Joseph of  Natural Variations  compiled a\u00a0 list of \" John Best's Greatest Hits \", back in March 2006. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2006/10/too-far-attacks-on-autistic-people/", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/10/hate-is-unmistakeable.html", "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/10/loving-will-prevail.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/10/the_mercury_militia_silences_a_voice_of.php", "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/john-bests-greatest-hits.html", "https://www.blogger.com/blogin.g?blogspotURL=http%3A%2F%2Fhatingautism.blogspot.com%2F", "http://mcville.net/article/45/kevin-leitch-interview", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://www.autismvox.com/left-brainright-brain-closes/", "http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2007/10/john-best.html", "http://joyofautism.blogspot.com/2007/10/stand-tall.html", "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/10/kev-any-way-you-may-reconsider.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/10/the_mercury_militia_silences_a_voice_of.php", "http://rockstarramblings.blogspot.com/2007/10/old-troll-got-even-nastier.html", "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/10/loving-will-prevail.html", "http://healthylivingcentre.co.uk/health/Autism/17524/", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/10/hate-is-unmistakeable.html", "http://www.drumsnwhistles.com/2007/10/15/another-great-blogger-sidelined-by-a-cyberbully/", "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/10/wizards-and-more-colorful-kansas.html", "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/", "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/03/john-bests-greatest-hits.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2007/10/beyond-appallin.html", "title": "Beyond Appalling and Disgusting: The Thug John Best, jr"},

(and children and elderly still do die from these outbreaks,\neven today with modern medicine and all).\n I apologize for sounding too harsh and insinuating that all\nanti-vaccine advocates are misinformed, uninformed, or fanatical, as I\nknow from Nicki that is not the case. \u00a0 However, I standby my advice to\ndo your own reading, but bring your theories and questions to a medical\ndoctor so that he/she can tell you which concerns are supported,\nrefuted, or still remain completely unclear based on the research. \nMedical literature is difficult to navigate, and your doctor can help\nyou there.\u00a0  \n\n Thanks to Emilie for clarifying that every reputable\njournal requires publishers to report their funding source, so you do\nnot have to discredit all research as possible drug company-funded\nstudies with a bias.\u00a0 I have also never advocated going to a doc who is\nunwilling to discuss your concerns or help in your education regarding\nvaccinations.\u00a0  \n\n I agree with Nicki - any doc who brushes you aside and\nrefuses to engage in a discussion, or doesn\u2019t allow you to feel part of\nthe decision-making team for your child\u2019s health is not someone I\u2019d\ntake my child too either.\u00a0 That said, I still do not think having an\noffice-wide vaccination policy is a bad thing, simply from a public\nhealth perspective.\u00a0 As Jen said, waiting rooms are cesspools for\ninfectious diseases and I can only imagine how devastated any of us\nwould be if our kid became seriously ill from a preventable disease\nbecause someone else\u2019s parent chose not to vaccinate.  \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.goodhappenings.com/WordPress/?p=244", "http://www.goodhappenings.com/WordPress/?p=245"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2007/11/pho-for-four-bl.html", "title": "Pho For Four \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb My 2 Cents on Vaccinations"},
{"date": "Saturday, August 04, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Virginia Hughes published an article,  Mercury Rising , in the August 1st edition of the British publication,  Nature Medicine,  detailing the increasingly violent invective used by those who believe that vaccination and autism are related. \n\n Why do I care? I don't have an autistic relative. \n\n I care about rational discourse.\u00a0 I want public-health decisions made in accordance with science, not mystical belief (as Orac points out).\u00a0 I also care about civility and the freedom from intimidation.  \n\n Below the fold, responses from three bloggers (more added as I find them).\u00a0 The threats against Paul Offit have been truly horrifying. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t Kevin Leitch  was interviewed for the article.\u00a0 His post on the article  includes examples  of the abuse he and his daughter have received from John Best and Ray Gallup (among others).  \n\n Kristina Chew  also responds to the article  (thoughtfully including long excerpts). \n\n Orac  posts a long response, relating the increasing stridency of the anti-vaccination camp to animal rights activists, and concludes: \n\n The mercury militia  has become, in essence a religion. Like a religion, its members have developed a self-contained belief system, namely that mercury in vaccines causes autism and thus that their children are \"victims\" of vaccines who are \"vaccine injured\"; that the government, in cahoots with big pharma, has covered it up through the CDC; that scientists are in on the conspiracy because of a fanatical belief in vaccination; and that chelation therapy, along with a lot of other quackery that goes under the rubric of \"biomedical treatments\" can reverse the \"vaccine damage.\" They are mutually self-supporting. Like pseudosciences inspired by other religions, namely creationism and its \"intelligent design\" variant, they churn out poor quality papers chock full of bad science to \"support\" their beliefs, for example, the \"science\" produced by  drivel produced in abundance by Geier  p\u00e8re et fils  and, most recently the  dubious telephone survey by Generation Rescue  mentioned in the  Nature Medicine  news article. \n\n And the mercury militia reacts in much the same way as cults react when their core beliefs are challenged.

Cal's ignorance and hostility made my jaw drop.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n Every special ed kid costs schools more money. \r\n \r\n Well, yes and no.\u00a0 IDEA mandates that the federal government dispurse money to fund special education, and that the states .\u00a0 School funding is an arcane and complicated subject, however, students classified as \"special education\" in fact are funded at a higher rate than general education students.\u00a0 For a highly-readable discussion of the subject, I refer you to Lisa Snell's article,  \"How schools use the \"learning disability\" label to cover up their failures\"  in\u00a0 \u00a0in Reason Magazine,. \r\n \r\n  They are incredibly expensive. \r\n \r\n Again, yes and no.  Some points for your ignorant commenter: \r\n \r\n The majority of students in special education are there because of specific learning disabilities, which can be remediated.\u00a0 Figures vary by state, about 13% of schoolchildren ages 13-16 are in special education; of those, somewhere around 60% of students have specific learning disabilities, according to the  Center for Secondary Education and Transition .  \r\n Failing to remediate learning disabilities has a very high social cost. Those who exit the education system with poor reading and math skills are more likely to committ crimes.\u00a0 According to  The JFA Institute's   April 2004 study, The Impact of Ignoring Dyslexia and Reading Disabilities in the Criminal Justice System ( downloadable from this page ) , for every $1 invested in remediating dyslexia, the state can expect to save $12 in later criminal justice/corrections spending.\u00a0  \r\n  In some states, \"Special Ed\" also includes services for the gifted and talented (see for example,  Colorado   \r\n Students with ADHD are also often in the special education system, under the category of \"other health impaired\".\u00a0 According to several studies, inmates in the correctional system have much higher incidence of undiagnosed/untreated ADHD.\u00a0 To my knowledge, no studies have yet been done on the social savings of successfully treading ADHD in school-aged children, yet the evidence from the JFA study suggest that the savings will exist.  \r\n Children with severe disabilities  are  expensive to educate. However, the numbers are quite small.\u00a0 According to the  National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities ,\u00a0 Given a population of 10,000 school children, about 39 will be in the \"severe and profound\" category.  \r\n While education is expensive, one may argue that warehousing--doing nothing, failing to educate, is far more expensive \r\n \r\n \r\n and\u00a0 Wealthy parents get lawyers and game the system for millions, and all the rest of the kids get inadequate educations that still cost more money.  \r\n \r\n Marcus Winters and Jay Greene addressed this popular myth in the Spring 2007 issue of Education Next, in their article  Debunking a Special Education Myth \r\n \r\n A popular riff on the idea that special education students are bleeding public school budgets blames private placements. A large number of mostly undeserving disabled students and their clever parents, critics allege, have managed to get public schools to pay for attendance at expensive private schools. \r\n \r\n In other words, the \"wealthy parents gaming the system for millions\" is an urban myth.\u00a0 \r\n \r\n They  [students with disabilities]  should be removed from the system and their education funded differently. Public schools should be reserved for the \u201cneurotypical.\u201d \r\n \r\n I'd like to ask Mr. Anonymous to expand on this notion a little bit.\u00a0 Who determines what is \"neurotypical\"?\u00a0 Is it the child with the 155 IQ and some behavioral issues?\u00a0 Is it the child with normal cognitive capacities, but with mobility problems caused by cerebral palsy?\u00a0 Some other designation? \r\n \r\n That doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t receive funding; it should just come from a different pool of money\u2013health care, probably.  \r\n \r\n Good luck with reforming education funding, Mr. Anonymous.\u00a0 \u00a0Those of us with kids with special needs are doing all we can to get our kids educated to the extent of their abilities,  today .\u00a0 We can't\u00a0 wait around for funding reform, while our kids languish. \u00a0 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rummelhudson.com/", "http://pajamasmedia.com/2007/11/the_new_nomads_families_in_sea.php", "http://joannejacobs.com/2007/11/16/special-ed-nomads/", "http://pajamasmedia.com/2007/12/mainstreaming_special_needs_ki.php", "http://www.vickiforman.com/?p=833#comments", "http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_7_34/ai_94775375/pg_", "http://www.ncset.org/", "http://www.jfa-associates.com/", "http://www.jfa-associates.com/publications/", "http://www.cde.state.co.us/index_special.htm", "http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs8txt.htm", "http://educationnext.org/debunking-a-special-education-myth/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2007/12/keep-your-disab.html", "title": "Keep Your Disabled Kid Out of My Kid's Classroom"},

This hypothesis is an outgrowth of the failed efforts to link autism rises to the use of mercury preservatives in vaccines. To the best of my knowledge, it has no experimental support, but it has led to a lucrative business for those who promise \"cures\" for autism through treatments that supposedly remove heavy metals from patients' blood via chelation. Notably, Mariea runs a clinic that offers these treatments, and would thus benefit from any aura of credibility chelation achieves. The third thing that is raising my bloodpressure:\u00a0  Catherine Morgan 's\u00a0  claim  at BlogHer's  Mommy and Family channel  that  the chicken pox, HPV, and even (dare I say it) the flu vaccine , are more to benefit the pharmaceutical industry and less to benefit the people...and that is just wrong. She goes on about  the flu vaccine here . \n\n Look.\u00a0 I am not a health care professional (Morgan trained as a nurse).\u00a0 I am just a lowly anthropologist/MBA/about to be ed grad student.\u00a0 But even I can grasp the basic concepts behind epidemiology, public health, and community immunity. Community immunity:  Having a large\npercentage of the population vaccinated in order to prevent the spread\nof certain infectious diseases. Even individuals not vaccinated (such\nas newborns and those with chronic illnesses) are offered some\nprotection because the disease has little opportunity to spread within\nthe community.\u00a0  One of Mike Staunton's commenters hit the nail on the head. I think that is at the core of antivax belief,  they don\u2019t mind if an\nepidemic rages through a city and kills half of the population, because\nthey are just pretty sure if it DID come to their city the half that\nlive will be all their friends and family and all the truly good\npeople\u2026 doesn\u2019t matter if the others die. Cull the weak, you know.

Or more accurately,  to pound his opponents with frivolous intimidatory subpoenas. \n\n \u00a0  As Ms. Seidel writes,  Dr. McCormick has my solidarity and sympathy \u2014 as do any other critical participants in public discourse about autism and vaccines who might join our ranks. \u00a0 \n\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t If you aren't an academic or a scientist, you may not have a clear picture of the structure and meaning of the National Academies of Science. It isn't part of government; it is an independent, non-profit body.  \n\n \n\n \nThe Institute was incorporated on March 3, 1863 ,\n\n the Academy shall, whenever called upon by any department of the Government, investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art, the actual expense of such investigations, examinations, experiments, and reports to be paid from appropriations which may be made for the purpose, but the Academy shall receive no compensation whatever for any services to the Government of the United States. In the decades following 1863, the  National Academy of Science  (NAS) also established the\u00a0  National Research Council ,  National Academy of Engineering Council (NAE) , and the  Institute of Medicine (IOM) .\u00a0 Each are not-for-profit membership organizations.\u00a0 It is an honor to be elected to the NAS and its divisions.\u00a0 However, membership also entails service.\u00a0 As the IOM puts it: The Institute of Medicine's members , elected on the basis of their professional achievement, serve without compensation in the conduct of studies, conferences, and other Institute inquiries into matters of national policy for health. Election to active membership is both an honor and a commitment to serve in Institute affairs \u00a0 \n\n \n\t\t\t Technorati Tags :\n\t\t\t anti-vaccination ,  autism ,  dan olmstead ,  david kirby \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/kathleen_seidel_is_not_alone.php", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/150/", "http://www.citizen.org/litigation/briefs/IntFreeSpch/", "http://www.citizen.org", "http://www.shoemakerassociates.com/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/126/", "http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/marie-mccormick/", "http://www.iom.edu/?ID=4705", "http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/04/scientist-subpo.html", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/151/", "http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/Other/Act_to_incorporate.asp", "http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/Other/Act_to_incorporate.asp", "http://www.nationalacademies.org/about/", "http://sites.nationalacademies.org/nrc/index.htm", "http://www.nae.edu/nae/naehome.nsf", "http://www.iom.edu/", "http://www.iom.edu/CMS/2951/7266.aspx", "http://technorati.com/tag/anti-vaccination", "http://technorati.com/tag/autism", "http://technorati.com/tag/dan%2Bolmstead", "http://technorati.com/tag/david%2Bkirby"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2008/04/goodish-news-on.html", "title": "Good(ish) News on the Seidel Subpoena, and another Shoemaker Fishing Expedition"},
{"date": "Saturday, May 03, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t The suit was brought by the Rev. Lisa Sykes and her husband Seth Sykes, alleging that their son's autism was caused by thimerosal in injections received by both Rev. Sykes and the child. \n\n Their attorney, Clifford Shoemaker, filed an invasive subpoena against Kathleen Seidel for her work at Neurodiversity.com. \n\n Seidel reported May 2, 2008, that the Sykes had withdrawn the suit. \n\n As PalMD noted,  Rev. Sykes was successful in another arena : The United Methodist Church approved her petition about \"mercury containing drugs\". \n\n And Orac gives a close reading to the newly-published Palmer et al. study, alleging a connection between mercury exposure from coal-burning power plants and autism rates in surrounding areas.\u00a0  It's entirely possible that some environmental factor,  or factors, may contribute to the development of autism, either on their own or by acting with some genetic susceptibility, but if that is the case with mercury this study is thin gruel to use to support such a hypothesis. In fact, it's not even that good as a hypothesis-generating study. There's just too much potential interference from confounding variables that hasn't been accounted for. Finally, it is important to note that Dr. Palmer may well be biased. For example, yesterday he spoke at a demonstration promoted by Safeminds and Autism United, both boosters of the \"vaccines cause autism\" lie. I tried to find an account that describes what he said there, but the best that I could find was this, which didn't say much. Given the poor quality of this study and his cozying up to antivaccination groups, one has to wonder. If he has an obvious source of bias, it may well explain much; if he does not I'm left with the less satisfying conclusion that he is just not a very good scientist at all. I also have to wonder about the quality of the peer review of this particular journal. After all, if I, who am not an epidemiologist, can spot the glaring flaws in this study, why couldn't the peer reviewers?

{"date": "Sunday, April 27, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t A forceful voice in autism debate: Mother's site battles mercury theories \u00a0 by Margot Sanger-Katz \n\n \n \nKathleen Seidel is not a doctor. She's not a medical researcher. She's not an educator. She's not a lawyer. But the 52-year old Peterborough woman, armed with a degree in library science and a healthy sense of outrage, has become one of the leading voices in the public debate about a possible link between autism and vaccines.\n \n\n \nSeidel's website,  neurodiversity.com , is a clearinghouse for autism-related literature, and her attached  weblog  has become the site of an impassioned and thoroughly researched campaign against a group of scientists and lawyers who promote the theory that childhood vaccines cause the developmental disorder.\n \n\n \nFor Seidel, who guards her family's privacy but says she has a child with an autism spectrum diagnosis, the scientific evidence disputing their claims is overwhelming. A series of conclusive reports from government scientists have found no connection between autism and a mercury-based preservative once contained in vaccines. And Seidel said that her own family's experience has further cemented her belief that the disorder has a strong genetic component.\n \n\n \nBut those studies haven't persuaded a significant number of parents who believe that their children were poisoned by vaccines and suspect the U.S. government of denying its culpability. Their views are taken seriously. Nearly 5,000 are involved in a massive legal action to get compensation for their children, and many politicians and medical commentators stand behind the mercury poisoning theory. Among those who believe that mercury might cause autism are Sens. Hillary Clinton, John McCain and Barack Obama.\n \n\n \nSeidel believes that the propagation of the theory causes many harms: It traumatizes parents, who believe their children have been poisoned and must be fixed; it harms children, who are subjected to medically unnecessary treatments designed to remove mercury from their bodies; it discourages vaccination, leaving children vulnerable to deadly diseases; and it distracts autism activists and researchers from the work she feels is most important.\n \n\n \n\"There's been a lot of energy, a lot of attention that been focused in an area that's not going to help disabled kids,\" Seidel said. \n \n \n\nI agree exactly with Seidel: focusing on the outdated notion that vaccination is causal in autism is harmful and deflects attention from more central issues. \n\n Previously: Kathleen Seidel Slapped with Subpoena Good News on Seidel Subpoena Neurodiversity on the \"Hidden Horde\" How Bad Ideas Are Propagated Anti-Vaccination Shills Score a Big One \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080427/FRONTPAGE/804270376", "http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080427/FRONTPAGE/804270376", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2008/04/kathleen-seid-1.html", "title": "Kathleen Seidel Profiled In Home Town Paper"},

Lisa Sykes and her husband Seth Sykes , who claim that  thimerosal caused their son's autism  and  have filed a personal-injury lawsuit against vaccine manufacturers .\u00a0  \r\n\r\n The Sykes'\u00a0 attorney, Clifford Shoemaker, maintains a website for his firm, in which he claims that  The evidence is now overwhelming  that mercury injected into pregnant women and small infants has caused a huge epidemic of autism in this county. In fact, the evidence is  now overwhelming  that  there is no connection between vaccination and autism.\u00a0  Anyone continuing to so claim is engaging in  manufactroversy . \r\n\r\n Mr. Shoemaker was featured in a March 24, 2008 Neurodiversity.com post,  The Commerce in Causation , detailing how much money Shoemaker earns from litigating autism-vaccine-injury claims. On March 26, 2008, Seidel was  served with a subpoena , issued by Shoemaker, to produce documents and records for the Sykes' suit. \r\n\r\n Walter Olson, writing at  Overlawyered  and  PointofLaw.com the first phrase that occurred to me  on looking through the subpoena was \"fishing expedition\", and the second was \"intimidation\". Several clauses indicate that Shoemaker is hoping to turn up evidence that Seidel has accepted support from the federal government, or from vaccine makers, which she says she hasn't. Also among the documents demanded: Seidel's correspondence with other bloggers. Including me.\u00a0 But I'm in illustrious company, if you read the subpoena (available  here ).\u00a0 Seidel has filed a counter-motion to quash the subpoena;  the attorney  has two weeks to respond. \r\n\r\n You should also read Seidel's post on the  big business of vaccine litigation \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUpdate April 4:\u00a0 Positive Internet Reaction to Seidel's work and expressions of support for Seidel in the subpoena matter \r\n\r\n April 3 responses in alphabetical order  \r\n\r\n Autista : Rediculous (and points out the chilling effect on blogging, should the subpoena stand) \r\n\r\n Denialism : Autism Cranks Going After Bloggers \r\n\r\n Grey Matter/White Matter : \r\n\r\n I Call BS : When Bullies Get a Subpoena To Weild \r\n\r\n I Speak of Dreams : this post   \r\n\r\n Instapundi t: Subpoena Abuse \r\n\r\n Jack's News Blog : Sandy: Blogger on Autism Hit With Subpoena \r\n\r\n James Randi Educational Foundation Forum (JREF) : discussion of subpoena \r\n\r\n Law Bites : Quote from  Overlawyered   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Open Records : Blogger intimidation with a FOIA twist \r\n\r\n Overlawyered  (cross posted at  Point of Law Forum  and  Iatrogrogenic Forum ): Vaccine Lawyer Subpoenas Kathleen Seidel \r\n\r\n Pure Pedantry : Autism Cranks Attempt To Intimidate Blogger by Subpoena \r\n\r\n Woman Scientist : Links to the Absurd \r\n\r\n You Are My Minions : Autism Awareness Fallout \r\n\r\n April 4 2008--to 9:39 PM PDT (alphabetical order) \r\n\r\n Action for Autism : Shoemaker's Subpoena Is A Load of Cobblers   \r\n\r\n Ars Technica : Blogger ensnared in hotly contested autism-vaccine lawsuit   \r\n\r\n Asperger Square 8 : Welcome to the \"I am Kathleen\" Scavenger Hunt \r\n\r\n Aspies for Freedom : Discussion Board \r\n\r\n Autism Street : I am Kathleen \r\n\r\n Axinar :\u00a0 Autism-Vaccine / Neurodiversity War Getting UGLY \r\n\r\n Bronze Dog : Anti-Vaxxer Thuggery \r\n\r\n Bug Girl's Blog : Chilly Climate for Blogging? \r\n\r\n BuzzTracker : List of posts on issue \r\n\r\n Club 166 : kathleen SLAPPed-- Blogs slap back \r\n\r\n DKMNow : Shoemaker\u2019s Witch-Hunt: An Open Letter \r\n\r\n Dr. J's House Calls : The Plane!\u00a0 The Plane! \r\n\r\n Elf M.

The blogs are my hobby, which I support out of my own income.\u00a0 I do not accept funding or advertising. \r\n\r\n I have never received anything of monetary value from Kathleen Seidel or Neurodiversity.com. \r\n\r\n I have never met Kathleen Seidel in person. \r\n\r\n I have never spoken to\u00a0 Kathleen Seidel. \r\n\r\n To the best of my knowledge, I have never been in the same building with Kathleen Seidel. \r\n\r\n I have\u00a0 e-mailed, or exchanged e-mails with Kathleen Seidel approximately 10 times since 2004 (the extent of my records). \r\n\r\n I do own stock in various enterprises in the healthcare sector of the US economy.\u00a0 To the best of my recollection, all such stocks were inherited from my parents' estate in the mid-1990s.\u00a0 The collective value of such shares amounts to no more than 1.4% of my net worth. \r\n\r\n To the best of my knowledge, dividend income from the entire healthcare sector of my securities portfolio has accounted to less than 1% of my annual income. \r\n\r\n In other words, I spend more on groceries and fuel for my vehicles than I earn from my healthcare sector securities.\u00a0 Big Agra and Big Oil has a much bigger influence on my finances than Big Pharma. \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links":

{"date": "Sunday, August 10, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Updated \n\n Those who believe that autism is caused by children's bodies being contaminated by mercury often seek to  remove the mercury, through chelation .\u00a0 \u00a0This procedure seems to be  widely used , although it has never been evaluated for effectiveness.\u00a0 \u00a0( NIMH proposed such a study in 2006 but it was  suspended in 2007 , after  health risks were found .) The study has again been proposed, but  many find it unethica l. \n\n Despite the lack of studies for safety and efficacy, many parents of autistic children put them on chelating regimens, both intravenous and oral.  \n\n At  a 2007 conference , a professor of chemistry at the University of Kentucky, Boyd Haley, described a new oral chelator he had \"in development\", which incited anticipation among the autism-is-mercury-poisoning faithful.\u00a0 In May 2008,\u00a0 Haley\u00a0 gave a similar presentation, this time referring to his product as \"an antioxidant\", and indicating that it would be marketed under the name of \"Oxidative Stress Release\", or OSR, as a dietary supplement.\u00a0 On July 23, 2008, a dentist, Paul G. Wilke, announced that he would be selling OSR. \n\n By July 30, 2008, at least one child was being administered 50 mg\u00a0 of\u00a0 OSR (or BDET) twice a day.  \n\n On August 1, 2008, Kathleen Seidel, blogging at Neurodiversity.com  sent  a letter to the University of Kentucky, describing the sequence of events in detail.\u00a0 The letter asks a series of pointed questions about Haley's conduct and relationship to the university, including  Does the university condone Prof. Haley\u2019s apparent plans  to conduct uncontrolled post-marketing toxicity studies and efficacy testing on disabled children before initiating any large-scale testing on adults? And is the university\u2019s Institutional Review Board providing any ethical review of Prof. Haley\u2019s studies of the effect of OSR on human beings? As of today (August 10, 2008) Seidel has not received any response from the University of Kentucky.\u00a0 However, there are further developments: \n\n On August 8, 2008, one  of the commenters on the Seidel letter  wrote that OSR is chemically identical to a product patented by Atwood et. al (also at the University of Kentucky), called BDET, used for \"decontamination of soil and water from waste treatment facilities, chemical and metal-finishing industrial sites, municipal landfills, and mines.\" \n\n\n\n On August 9, 2008, Seidel published a second post,  The Industrial Treatment , detailing the similarities between the Atwood product (BDETH 2  ) and the product Haley was marketing.\u00a0 The University of Kentucky holds the patents for the Atwood products, and Seidel concludes: it would seem prudent for the University of Kentucky to investigate the possibility that BDETH 2 \u00a0 has been perverted from its legitimate use in the decontamination of toxic waste and industrial sites to a more questionable use as an inadequately-tested chelation drug marketed as a \u201cdietary supplement\u201d for autistic children who have been dubiously diagnosed with chronic heavy metal poisoning.

{"date": "Thursday, July 31, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t I am not an investigative reporter, and don't even think of myself as a \"citizen journalist\".\u00a0 But maybe I could give lessons in investigation. \r\n Sharyl Attkisson  has been a reporter at CBS for 15 years; her current title is \"investigative reporter\" and her area\u00a0 is \"government spending and taxpayer issues\".\u00a0 \u00a0However, she has also aired some stories on the disproven hypothesis that there is a connection between vaccination and autism.\u00a0 Ms. Attkisson's pieces tend to perpetuate the mistaken idea that there is a connection ( here  and  here , for example)--sufficiently biased to label Ms. Attkisson as a vaccine rejectionist. \r\n Recently, Attkisson's journalistic objectivity,\u00a0 diligence in investigation, and use of sources have been called into question. \r\n The  Society for Professional Journalism's Code of Ethics  reads in part: \r\n \r\n Test the accuracy of information from all sources and exercise care to avoid inadvertent error. Deliberate distortion is never permissible. \r\n Diligently seek out subjects of news stories to give them the opportunity to respond to allegations of wrongdoing. \r\n Identify sources whenever feasible. The public is entitled to as much information as possible on sources' reliability. \r\n Distinguish between advocacy and news reporting. Analysis and commentary should be labeled and not misrepresent fact or context. \r\n \r\n Part One  of Attkisson's questionable journalistic ethics: the content and tone of the July 25, 2008 piece,\u00a0 \"How Independent Are Vaccine Defenders?\" \r\n Part Two  of Attkisson's questionable journalistic ethics: the almost simultaneous transmission of a letter of protest from the director of  Voices for Vaccines  to CBS and the publication of the contents of said letter on a militantly anti-vaccination website, Age of Autism. (You can  download V4V_to_CBS_retraction_demand.pdf  by clicking on the link.) \r\n My question is: how much of Attkisson's \"investigating\" consists of rewriting and rewording statements from principals at the advocacy--even propaganda--organization,\u00a0 Age of Autism?\u00a0  \r\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n Part One , Con't: \r\n On July 25, 2008, CBS aired Attkisson's latest:\u00a0 \" How Independent Are Vaccine Defenders ?\", which included innuendos that  Paul Offit  (a co-inventor of the  RotaTeq  oral vaccine) has profited hugely from the patent, and therefore (a) he has an undisclosed conflict of interest (COI) and (b) Offit's objectivity on the subject of vaccination in general is suspect.\u00a0 \r\n Much of what Attkisson reported about Offit had been previously published--some on the Age of Autism site. A simple Google search on the AoA site revealed  many posts directly attacking  Offit's integrity and objectivity, using data similar to Attkisson's. \r\n As Autism News Beat responded:  CBS News unearths evidence that people are paid for work .\u00a0 \r\n Attkisson made much of Offit holding an \"endowed chair\" funded (in part) by a drug company.\u00a0 She was inaccurate about the amount of the endowment (alleging $1.5 million, instead of the actual $2 million endowment).\u00a0 One of Orac's commenters clarified the issue as follows: \r\n \r\n An endowed chair gives a researcher a constant supply of funding without he need to write grant proposals.  It allows the researcher to work on very self-directed projects and do more exploratory work. \r\n The chair endowment is held by the institution (CHOP and Penn in this case) not the professor. So, Dr. Offit doesn't have $1.5M (or, $2M as those interested in accuracy have noted) to work with. He has the proceeds of this endowment. Think of it as a trust fund for the researcher---she/he can't touch the principal. Also, the institution controls the endowment and who gets the chair after the professor (Dr. Offit in this case) steps down or retires. They have to follow the restrictions of the endowment--which likely stipulate that a vaccine researcher gets the money--but Merck is likely not involved directly in deciding future chair holders. \r\n Also note that the endowed chair was created in 2005--after Dr. Offit's vaccine was patented and put to use. So, it couldn't have influenced his actions to create the vaccine. Also, since the endowment is already in place, it doesn't affect Dr. Offit's decision to speak out in favor of vaccine safety. He could say vaccines are evil and Merck wouldn't be able to do anything about the chair. \r\n Is it any shock to anyone that a man who spent 25 years developing a vaccine would think that vaccines are safe? \r\n \r\n I spent about 120 seconds looking for the announcement of the chair's establishment.\u00a0 That's all it took to find that the Merck foundation funded 3/4 of the chair ($1.5 million) and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) contributed the other 1/4, as the  press release announcing the endowment's creation revealed . \r\n \r\n The Hilleman Chair will accelerate the pace of vaccine research at the University of Pennsylvania. The Merck Company Foundation will provide a $1.5 million endowment, which will be held jointly by University of Pennsylvania and CHOP. CHOP will contribute $500,000 in matching funds, bringing the total endowment to $2 million. \r\n \r\n Attkisson ended her attack on Offit's integrity with the following innuendo: \r\n \r\n And future royalties for the vaccine were just sold for $182 million cash. Dr. Offit's share of vaccine profits? Unknown. \r\n \r\n I was curious about Attkisson's allegations about Offit's share in future profits from Rotateq, so I went to the  United States Patent Database , and found that Dr. Offit does not, in fact, control the patent or its revenues.\u00a0 (Note: I'd never used the database before, and it took me a whopping 90 seconds to the relevant record.\u00a0 I am guessing that Attkisson didn't even try). \r\n \r\n Inventors:  Clark; H Fred (Philadelphia, PA), Offit; Paul (Philadelphia, PA), Plotkin; Stanley A. (Doylestown, PA) \r\n Assignee:  The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia \"CHOP\" (Philadelphia, PA); The Winstar Institute of Anatomy and Biology \"WIAB\" (Philadelphia, PA) \r\n \r\n Maybe I know more about patents, because I live in Silicon Valley and know folks who hold one or more, but it was obvious to me after the search that Offit may not see any of the futures revenue. People who develop a patentable idea (in this case, the Rotateq\u00a0 vaccine) are typically an employee of an enterprise.\u00a0 The terms of the employee's employment contract typically assigns any patentable discoveries to the enterprise (in this case, CHOP and WIAB).\u00a0 Depending upon the wording of the employment contract, there\u00a0 may or may not be a sharing of income from licensing that is done by the patent assignees. \r\n Part Two , Con't: \r\n This morning (July 31, 2008)  Lisa Randall , the Interim Executive Director for  Voices for Vaccines , sent a letter addressed to Katie Couric as Managing Editor of the CBS television network, via fax and email.\u00a0 \u00a0Copies of the letter were sent to Attkisson, her producer, and CBS's medical correspondent.\u00a0 \r\n The closing paragraph of the letter reads: \r\n \r\n We call upon CBS to issue a retraction of Ms. Attkisson's report and an apology to the individuals and institutions whose good and honorable work in the field of immunization has been smeared.\u00a0 We further ask CBS to reflect upon the fact that it does not befit a user of the public airwaves to broadcast misleading claims aobut the most important public health measure of our time. \r\n \r\n Within hours--perhaps minutes-- after Randall sent the letter, Kim Stagliano at  Age of Autism  site had a copy of the letter, which she reposted in full, and went on to repeat previous  Age of Autism attacks  on both Randall's integrity and that of Voices for Vaccine's\u00a0 parent body,\u00a0 the  Taskforce for Child Survival and Development \r\n download V4V_to_CBS_retraction_demand.pdf \r\n What I have done: \r\n \r\n Written this blog post \r\n Posted a comment at Age of Autism, indicating my disgust with AoA tactics caused me to donate both to the  Immunization Action Coalition  and  Voices for Vaccines  (go  here  to donate to V4V via the  Taskforce for Child Survival  --put \"donation for V4V\" in the message box ) \r\n Sent a stiffly-worded feedback message to CBS Evening News (if you'd like to join me, go  CBS Evening News homepage , scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click on \"contact us\"). \r\n Told my friends about this blot on journalistic ethics. \r\n \r\n Sources defending Dr. Offit's integrity and the value of vaccination:\u00a0  (note I have sometimes re-worded titles) \r\n \r\n Autism News Beat:  CBS unearths evidence that people are paid to work  (July 26, 2008) \r\n Orac at Respectful Insolence on  More biased \"journalism\" about Vaccines  (July 28, 2008) \r\n Orac at Respectful Insolence on  Large errors in the Wall Street Journal's Health Blog  (July 29, 2008) \r\n Kevin Leitch at LeftBrain/RightBrain:  Vaccine defenders have conflicts of interest?

{"date": "Saturday, June 28, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Via  Holford Watch  and  BrainDuck , I learned that on June 20, the UK paper The Sun reported that Wynford Dore purchased the assets of two\u00a0 DDAT (UK) Limited and Camden Holdings Limited, which together owned the Dore treatment facilities in the UK.\u00a0 However, the purchase was limited to the firms' assets, not liabilities. \nThat means staff owed  thousands of pounds in wages and parents who paid more \nthan \u00a32,000 for the controversial course are likely to be left out of \npocket. From reading Wynford Dore's undated letter (possibly published June 20, 2008;  Download Wynford200608.pdf \n\n) two things seem clear: the business model was always predicated on having the UK government subsidize or fund entirely the cost of treatment: [I]t makes me all the more determined to make sure that it [the Dore \"technology] reaches everybody that needs it as quickly as possible. \n\n So how are we going to do that?\u00a0 Clearly we are not able to reach everyone ourselves\u00a0 \u2010\u00a0 this probably won\u2019t happen until the Government takes responsibility for providing it in every school and for every adult.\u00a0  The second point of clarity is that Wynford Dore is going to move to a sort of franchising model: So, just to summarise, we will not be re\u2010opening the majority of the original Dore Centres, but we will be developing relationships with local partners who will focus on their community and provide the Dore technology.\u00a0 Our plan is to open as many as are necessary of these local partnerships as soon as possible. I feel the way the folks at Holford Watch do: While Wynford Dore is apparently under no legal obligation to pay the creditors of Dore what they are owed, we very much hope that he has the integrity to do so:  in particular, we hope that he repays the staff and clients who have been left out of pocket when Dore companies went into administration .

She began calling her older sister's husband, a Philadelphia pediatrician, \"every five minutes\" with all kinds of questions, especially about shots. \"I asked him, 'Why are all of these necessary? Why are some people staggering them?'?\" Eventually her brother-in-law arranged a series of phone calls between Peet and his own mentor, Paul Offit, M.D., who is chief of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, a co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine, and a board member of  Every Child by Two , a pro-vaccine organization cofounded in 1991 by former first lady Rosalynn Carter. \r\n\r\n \"Once we had spoken, I was shocked at the amount of misinformation floating around, particularly in Hollywood,\" says Peet, who quickly boned up on the hot-button controversies surrounding the topic, including the unproven link between certain vaccines and autism; the safety of preservatives like mercury-based thimerosal; and the fear that the relatively high number of shots kids receive today can overwhelm young immune systems. Her conclusion? Well, not only is Frankie up-to-date on her vaccines (with no staggering), but her mom will soon appear in public-service announcements for  Every Child by Two . \"I buy 99 percent organic food for Frankie, and I don't like to give her medicine or put sunscreen on her,\" says Peet. \"But now that I've done my research, vaccines do not concern me.\" What does concern her is the growing number of unvaccinated children who are benefiting from the \"shield\" created by the inoculated\u2014we are protected from viruses only if everyone, or most everyone, is immunized: \"Frankly, I feel that parents who don't vaccinate their children are parasites.\" \r\n\r\n \r\nPaul Offit 's official website\r\n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001605/", "http://www.ecbt.org/", "http://www.cookiemag.com/entertainment/2008/07/amandapeet", "http://www.lilsugar.com/1779871", "http://modernmom.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=76&t=5884&start=0&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&sid=5ffe1a2a379bd5b87269f92f309f2dd2", "http://www.mamadramauncensored.com/?p=339", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2008/07/amanda-peet-thinks-parents-who-dont.html", "http://momaroundtheclock.blogspot.com/2008/07/amanda-peet-is-moron.html", "http://www.fromdatestodiapers.com/2008/07/are-parents-who-dont-vaccinate-their.html", "http://www.cookiemag.com/entertainment/2008/07/amandapeet", "http://www.ecbt.org/advocates/", "http://www.ecbt.org/advocates/", "http://www.paul-offit.com/"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2008/07/amanda-peets-vi.html", "title": "Amanda Peet's View on Vaccine Rejecting Parents: \"Parasites\".

Latest figures show 35 out of every 10,000 children are autistic. [ in Scotland \n\n But in Orkney, 22 times more children are diagnosed than in Forth Valley, which has the lowest rate. Yesterday, autism expert Dr Ken Aitken said it was unclear why there were differences.\u00a0 He said: 'There are huge variations across Scotland in what sort of measures they use to assess and diagnose kids with autism.\u00a0 'A lot of families move to rural locations because school sizes tend to be smaller and children are less likely to be teased. But you would expect the Western Isles and Shetland to have similar figures to Orkney if that is the reason. As far as we know, they don't.' \n\n The Executive compiled the report from council and health board figures.\u00a0 Previously, there was no central register.\u00a0 Now experts fear the figures could under-estimate the incidence of the disorder, which varies in its severity. \n\n Sufferers can find it hard to make sense of the world.\u00a0 Their speech may fail to develop and they may display obsessive behaviour.\u00a0 The exact causes are not known but research has highlighted genetic factors. \n\n Concerns have also been raised over a possible link between autism and the MMR jab,\u00a0 a link denied by health officials.\u00a0 Anti-MMR campaigners said the new statistics showed an autism 'epidemic'.\u00a0 Action Against Autism chairman Bill Welsh said: 'This is a national scandal of unbelievable proportions.' \n \n\n See the following for a thorough debunking of the connection between MMR and later autism:  \n \n MMR, autism and politics by Helene Guldberg \n\n \n\n \nspiked readers will be familiar with the writings of Dr Michael Fitzpatrick, east London GP and trenchant critic of official health policy. His new book, MMR and Autism: What parents need to know, develops the arguments put forward in his spiked columns around the MMR debacle, where highly dubious scientific claims about the potential damage caused by a triple vaccine have managed to throw the political and medical establishment into turmoil, and knock a major UK immunisation programme off course.  \n\n Dr Fitzpatrick persuasively and eloquently demolishes the key plank of the MMR panic: claims of a link between the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. Indeed, any risks associated with the MMR vaccine are virtually non-existent: 'when 500million doses of a vaccine have been given in 80 countries over more than 30 years, and serious adverse reactions are found to be extremely rare, then it is fair to describe it as \"safe\"', he says. Meanwhile the case for immunisation is indisputable: 'Diseases that had caused devastating epidemics in living memory, and had produced a significant toll of death and disability into the post-war period, have virtually disappeared.'  \n\n \nBut while MMR and Autism is a thorough dissection of the scientific and medical issues arising from the MMR panic, the book's scope is much broader than that. 'It is not a self-help manual intended to reassure parents worried about the safety of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, though it might very well do this', states an apt summary by Dr Anthony Daniels in the Sunday Telegraph (1). '[R]ather, it is a probing analysis of a continuing health scare, one that very soon suggests deep questions of political philosophy in general, and the nature of our society in particular.' Which begs the question - why focus on MMR in the first place?  \n\n \nNot so long ago, Fitzpatrick was better known for his involvement with left-wing politics than his interest in child immunisation. But as he explains, politics has changed a great deal since then - as has the social significance of such basic medical issues as vaccines. 'The MMR controversy is a good indicator of the changing character of politics over the past decade or so', he says. 'For a generation of young parents, the question of whether to give their child MMR - or single vaccines, or no vaccines at all - has become a bigger issue than which party to vote for in the election - or indeed, whether to vote at all.'  \n\n \nThe MMR issue, he says, has divided partners, families and friends in the same way they were once divided 'over Labour and Tory, or Thatcher and the miners. More dinner parties, barbecues and picnics have been spoiled by rows over MMR than even over the war in Iraq - never mind the European constitution'. \n\n \nWhy should this be the case? Fitzpatrick places the MMR controversy in the context of the collapse of traditional left and right politics, and the rise of a more individuated, risk-averse society. As Politics with a big 'P' has ceased to matter so much to people, issues relating to health - and those relating to lifestyle, education and other personal issues - have assumed an increasing importance in people's lives.  \n\n \nAnd as people have become more preoccupied with their own health and that of their children, the government has adopted a much higher profile on health issues. 'Health policy is no longer concerned primarily with providing services, but is more directed towards provoking individual anxieties and fears about smoking, obesity, and other \"unhealthy\" lifestyles, and relating to people's daily health concerns through initiatives like NHS Direct', he says. \n\n \nIn this situation, a health panic such as that surrounding the MMR vaccine is not a diversion from politics. It is politics. Like major political battles of the past, this scare has some very real and dangerous consequences - both for the state of debate, and for individuals' own lives. \n\n \nIt is well known that Fitzpatrick also has a personal interest in the MMR debate: his younger son, James, is severely autistic. But he is highly critical of the way that parents' groups have been hailed as the authority on MMR and autism, purely because they have autistic children, and stresses that James' condition 'does not give me any scientific insights. All it does is give me an insight into the experience of being a parent of an autistic child'.  \n\n \nHowever, he says, 'I am in the fortunate position of also being medically trained - so although I have no specialist expertise in any of these areas, I am in a better position than most parents to survey the literature'. The difficulties in doing this, he argues, should not be underestimated. There is no shortage of information about MMR and autism - and with the growth of the internet this information is very readily accessible. Unfortunately junk science is much more readily accessible than quality science. But 'what is difficult for parents is to assess the validity of this information. I do believe that many parents of autistic children have been seriously misguided'. \n\n\n\n The MMR scare has provoked 'a revolt of the anxious middle classes' \n\n As an example of how parents of autistic children have been 'cruelly misled' on the MMR question, Fitzpatrick cites the recent litigation suit against manufacturers of the vaccine, into which more than 1000 parents were drawn. Back in 1994 the Legal Aid Board agreed to fund a number of claims for compensation for injury allegedly caused by MMR: the first case in which such funding had been used to finance scientific research.  \n\n \nAs Fitzpatrick puts it, 'the Legal Aid Board sponsored a fishing trip by solicitors who hoped they would find some evidence to link MMR and autism. Nine years later, after spending \u00a315million of public money and failing to find such evidence, the then Legal Services Commission (LSC) [which replaced the Legal Aid Board] concluded that \"in retrospect it was not effective or appropriate for the LSC to fund research\"'. The court case that had been planned to start in April 2004 was abandoned, leaving the parents concerned twisting in the wind (see Medicine on trial, by Dr Michael Fitzpatrick). \n\n \nThis legal campaign, says Fitzpatrick, 'has had a wholly negative effect, nurturing the energies of parents in a thoroughly destructive way'. He is now challenging the LSC to release the research into the alleged link between MMR and autism. Though the LSC indicated that the results of these investigations would be passed on to the Medical Research Council (MRC), eight months later this has yet to happen.  \n\n \nIn the absence of this research, the key 'evidence' of a link between MMR and autism remains the work of Dr Andrew Wakefield - the high-profile gastroenterologist widely credited (and now officially discredited) as the protagonist in the MMR debate. His claims, that there was a link between the MMR vaccine and autism that was mediated by inflammatory bowel disease, were first publicised in 1998. Fitzpatrick's initial response when reading the paper was sheer amazement. 'I could not believe that such an insubstantial and speculative report could have such an impact', he says. 'It did not provide any evidence of a link between MMR and autism. All it reported was the conviction of the parents of eight of the 12 children in the study that such a link existed.'  \n\n \nIt was the claims in Wakefield's paper that provoked the initial wave of parental anxiety about whether to immunise their children or not. But while Fitzpatrick claims that Wakefield 'has behaved in a thoroughly reprehensible way', by choosing to launch a public campaign after failing to substantiate his hypothesis in the scientific world, he stresses that the problem cannot be reduced to Wakefield's actions. 'The broader question is why is it that one scientist who has gone over the wall can have such an influence', he says. 'The striking thing is that Wakefield is almost universally regarded by serious scientists as someone whose work cannot be taken seriously. Yet he seems to have been very persuasive to some journalists who have given him a remarkable degree of influence.' \n\n \n'There's a great irony here', continues Fitzpatrick. 'The anti-MMR campaign has been very successful in the media and one of its great successes has been to depict itself as being victimised and intimidated. Whereas the opposite is true: the people who have been really victimised and intimidated are the supporters of the vaccine, who have been subjected to vilification and abuse of quite an unprecedented character. It is true that Wakefield lost his job: but in the world of scientific research you cannot expect people to finance your research if you cannot substantiate your hypotheses. It is not so much that Wakefield has been victimised as that he's a casualty of his own dogmatic refusal to recognise reality.' \n\n \nFitzpatrick says that the anti-MMR campaign has also had a rather intimidating effect on the supporters of the vaccine. This is particularly the case in the world of autism: 'because the parents of autistic children have a vociferous pressure group, autism specialists, who almost universally don't believe in the MMR-autism link, are very reluctant to challenge it.'  \n\n \nHowever, it is not good enough to explain Wakefield's influence merely on the basis of the fickleness of the media. Wakefield would never have got this kind of hearing, Fitzpatrick argues, if it wasn't for the broader climate of public insecurity around health-related issues. 'The 1990s was a decade in which anxieties about health were reflected in the impact of a wide range of health scares and environmental alarms', he explains, in which a heightened sense of individual insecurity was expressed in a popular mood of risk-aversion and a culture of litigation. 'The narrowing scope of the realm of politics encouraged the politicisation of issues of health and disease, family relationships and childrearing practices. All these factors had a significant and growing impact on the MMR controversy throughout the 1990s.'  \n\n \nThe disproportionate impact of Wakefield's allegations, Fitzpatrick says, illustrates the effect of a particularly potent health scare in a society pervaded by an enhanced consciousness of risk. In this febrile climate, the MMR scare has provoked 'a revolt of the anxious middle classes', against a government that has tried doggedly but increasingly unsuccessfully to hold the line against a set of values (notably those of consumer sovereignty and choice) that it has done much to promote. When the same government that, for its own reasons, pushes the importance of patient involvement and choice in every layer of medical care then attempts to stand firm against growing parental demands for separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella, no wonder people suspect that something is afoot.  \n\n \nAlthough Fitzpatrick believes that the government's firm stand and robust challenge to the junk science around MMR provide a good model for what should be its approach in other areas, he believes that the government only has itself to blame for the MMR mess. Not only is 'its robust stance at such variance with the rest of its policy' - it is the government that has persistently made scares and panics central to health policy.  \n\n\n\n 'The object of immunisation policy is not to provide a \"pick-and-mix\" selection' \n\n Fitzpatrick has for a long time warned against the danger of using the tactic of scaremongering to promote public health. In his previous book, Tyranny of Health, Fitzpatrick emphatically lays out his objection to public health campaigns 'that have an emphasis on moralising about people's lifestyles when the evidence for their efficacy is very dubious'. Those public health campaigns to which he objects are distinct, he stresses, from 'public health measures which have been shown to be dramatically effective - like sanitation reform and immunisation campaigns. These have been demonstrated over a very long period of time to have very palpable benefits'.  \n\n \nThe irony is that the anti- MMR campaign has succeeded in raising fears over public health intervention, he explains, 'because the government has taken a leading role in promoting these sorts of scare campaigns: around issues such as HIV/AIDS, sun-related skin cancer, \"mad cow disease\", deep-vein thrombosis [DVT] and more'. In other words, the government has put itself in a very weak position to combat those scares that it does not want to promote. Worse still, the government has tried to use counter-scares to combat the anti-MMR campaign - for example, issuing dire threats about the impending threat of measles, 'in a way that, of course, is entirely ineffective'.  \n\n \nIn addition to the government, Fitzpatrick is also critical of the medical and scientific establishments, for their ineffectiveness in combating the anti-MMR campaign. 'This is because of their reluctance, over a period of time, to combat irrational trends in science generally. One illustration is the reluctance of those in the medical world to challenge anti-immunisation campaigns, which have grown from the margins of society to mainstream influence without being seriously challenged.' \n\n \nThis has led to the MMR controversy becoming the focus for a wider set of anxieties. 'That is what makes the issue of choice so central: people feel they can make a choice by opting for single vaccines in a way they feel unable to with very many other things in their lives', explains Fitzpatrick. 'At least they can say: \"right, I am not going to do this.\" But unfortunately the victim of that false sense of choice is their own child and other people's children. This is the sad thing - that people feel they can only exercise choice in such limited areas, where the consequences of exercising the choice has an entirely negative effect both on their children, who are left vulnerable, and other people's children, who are also left vulnerable.'  \n\n \n'The government has made choice a central theme of health policy and this is a good example of the sort of problem it creates', he says. 'The object of immunisation policy is not to provide a \"pick-and-mix\" selection to the public, but to provide a coherent programme for the prevention of infectious diseases.' \n\n \nBut does it matter if parents don't give their children the triple vaccine if instead they go for the single vaccines? At least their children are still immunised. Fitzpatrick does not agree. 'Even if they go for the single vaccine there's inevitably going to be a delay in their coverage and it is already clear that most people do not complete the single vaccines, for all sorts of obvious reasons.' \n\n \nAs well as providing a thorough critique of the MMR panic, MMR and Autism also gives an extensive review of the literature on autism. It is striking how little is still known about the condition, and Fitzpatrick is adamant that there is not going to be any cure for it anytime soon. 'It is inconceivable. Anybody that has any understanding of the profundity of the problem of autism will know that there is not going to be any fundamental cure for it in the lifetime of our children. That does not mean to say that there's nothing you can do about it. It does mean to say that if someone comes to you offering a miracle cure it's not going to work and is more likely to do harm.' Fitzpatrick strongly agrees with the point made by Charlotte Moore, in her book George and Sam: Autism in the family,that 'acceptance is all'. 'You have got to accept that your child is not going to be cured, but the question is how can you do the best you can for them.'  \n\n 'One of the great problems with the MMR controversy', argues Fitzpatrick, 'is that it has become a complete red herring in terms of the sorts of interventions that are likely to be helpful'. One stark example is the contrast between the \u00a315million of public money spent on the Legal Services Commission's 'fishing trip' for evidence of a link between MMR and autism, and the government announcing in 2002, in a blaze of publicity, that it was granting a mere \u00a33.5million to autism research.  \n\n 'There are very inadequate levels of teacher training to do with autism and very inadequate levels of social services support for families with autistic children', says Fitzpatrick. 'These are the really important areas, and the great problem with the MMR controversy is that it has distracted attention from this area - areas where research ought to be going.' \n\n MMR and Autism: What parents need to know is published by Routledge, June 2004.

An article to be published in the Friday issue of the Journal of American Physicians shows a drop of 22 percent in the occurrences of autism when mercury, an ingredient in the vaccine preservative thimerosal, was removed from childhood vaccinations. It's a fact.\u00a0 But wait--there are a lot of criticisms of this \"new research\". \n\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t Here are some other views\n\n From Respectful Insolence    The bottom line is that this study by the Geiers does not show what it claims to show because \n(1) it uses reporting databases for purposes for which they were not designed and for which the agencies maintaining them don't recommend; \n(2) one of these databases consists mainly of unverified reports of adverse events or diseases that the parent or doctor attribute to vaccines, whether correctly or incorrectly; \n(3) the authors use such mind-bogglingly simplistic statistical techniques to analyze the data that no conclusion can be made, certainly not the one they claim to make; \n(4) the investigators, Mark and David Geier, have a track record of abusing science and medicine, even to the point of proposing chemical castration as a treatment for autism in order to \"increase the efficacy of chelation therapy\"; and \n(5) the journal in which the findings are published is run by an organization that is expressly antivaccination. \n\n  Could mercury from thimerosal in vaccines be a major cause of autism? I suppose it's possible, but certainly this study doesn't support such a link. Nor do any of the studies by the Geiers, most of which are published in JAPS and other not-so-reputable journals.\n\n One of Orac's commentors posted a clear analysis:\u00a0 MarkCC, which stated the essence of what was wrong with the Geiers' so-called \"statistical analysis\" of the VAERS database:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0  Here's the key, fundamental issue:  when you're doing statistical analysis, you don't get to look at the data and choose a split point.  \n\n What the Geiers did is to look at the data, and find the best point for splitting the dataset to create the result they wanted. There is no justification for choosing that point except that it's the point that produces the result that they, a priori, decided they wanted to produce.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0  \n\n Time trend analysis is extremely tricky to do - but the most important thing in getting it right is doing it in a way that eliminates the ability of the analysis to be biased in the direction of a particular a priori conclusion. (In general, you do that  not  to screen out cheaters, but to ensure that whatever correlation you're demonstrating is real, not just an accidental correlation created by the human ability to notice patterns. It's very easy for a human being to see patterns, even where there aren't any.)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0  \n\n Redo the Geiers analysis using any decent time-trend analysis technique - even a trivial one like doing multiple overlapping three-year regressions (i.e., plot the data from '92 to '95, '93 to '96, '94 to '97, etc) and you'll find that that nice clean break point in the data doesn't really exist - you'll get a series of trend lines with different slopes, without any clear break in slope or correlation.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0  \n\n So - to sum up the problem in one brief sentence: in statistical time analysis, you do not get to pick break points in the time sequence by looking at the data and choosing the break point that is most favorable to your desired conclusion. \n\n\n \n\n Exactly! Unfortunately, that's exactly what the Geiers did.\n\nA proper statistical analysis of such data, looking for time points at which a rate of change in a variable changes, is designed such that there is no bias in selecting a time point at which a significant change in slope is observed.  \n\n As much as the Geiers might want to believe that there is a marked change in the slope of the curve beginning around late 2002 to early 2003, they can't assume that there is such a breakpoint before doing the analysis.\n\n \n\n Once again, what pseudoscientists like the Geiers never seem to understand is that all those precautions we scientists take with control groups and statistical analyses designed to minimize investigator bias exist because we realize how easy it is for a scientist, particularly a medical scientist who is invested in finding a cure for a particular disease or condition, to be seduced into believing something that is not supported by data. (If they did understand, they wouldn't use such simplistic and easily debunked \"scientific\" methodology.)  \n\n It's a very human tendency, and the scientific method is designed to minimize that tendency. That's why it takes so much training to overcome.\n\n Kathleen Seidel's  article rebutting  the Geiers' study discusses several with the data, including If one assumes that the same would be true for every regional\ncenter, and that the California DDS has no system in place to monitor\nhow many formerly-eligible applicants have been denied services since\nJuly 2003, one must conclude that post-July 2003 statistics cannot be\naccurately compared with those gathered prior to July 2003.  Bartholmew Cubbins\u00a0 has a  video blog explaining the problems  with the Geiers' analysis. \n\n I wonder if the good citizens reading the SeMissourian are going to see any of these more reasoned points of view. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.semissourian.com/story/1142982.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/03/the_geiers_go_dumpsterdiving_y_1.php", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/03/one_last_word_on_the_geiers_so_1.php", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/90/foreordained-conclusions", "http://bartholomewcubbins.blogspot.com/2006/03/bc-on-autism-episode-8-how-to-win-with.html"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2006/03/how_bad_ideas_g.html", "title": "How Bad Ideas Get Perpetrated"},
{"date": "Friday, November 19, 2004", "body": "\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Autism spectrum disorders  are baffling and heartbreaking.\u00a0 \u00a0The causes are unknown, but it is likely to be an intersection between genetics and exposure to one or more environmental effects (but not  maternal behavior ) \n\n There is the whole what-effect-does-vaccination-have-on-autism controvery, which is rife with poor science, poor thinking, and new-age quackery, and which has been explored: \n\n In  Deer's film  the autism authority Pat Howlin denounced the charlatans (some linked to the Wakefield campaign) who are making money out of vulnerable parents of children with autism by selling extravagantly priced preparations of vitamins and amino acids, colostrum and secretin, and other ingredients of unproven efficacy (and unknown adverse effects).  \n\n Making parents feel unwarranted guilt about having given their children MMR has caused widespread distress. \n \n \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t How did the doctor get away with it? \nBrian Deer's investigative documentary on MMR went some way towards redeeming the reputation of the media. \n\n by Dr Michael Fitzpatrick \n\n Brian Deer 's documentary  MMR: What the Doctor Didn't Tell You  - shown as part of the Dispatches series on the UK's Channel 4 last night - exposed the  sleaze and quackery  surrounding the campaign claiming a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. \n\n Dr Andrew Wakefield, the gastroenterologist who first suggested this link in a now-discredited article in the Lancet in 1998, presents himself as a serious scientist committed to the welfare of children with autism. Yet Deer revealed Dr Wakefield's commercial interests in discrediting the MMR vaccine (through a patent for a rival vaccine for measles) and the extent of his collaboration with charlatans who exploit vulnerable parents with offers of unproven treatments, even 'cures', for autism. Many viewers will have been shocked to discover the extent of Dr Wakefield's links with religious fundamentalists and alternative health crackpots in the USA. \n\n Deer's programme forcefully revealed the impact of the MMR scare. The mother of a little girl with autism described how she felt 'incredibly guilty' at the thought that her decision to give her daughter MMR had made her autistic (though she and the girl's father later rejected this specious notion). Another mother described how she had cancelled an appointment for her son to have MMR after becoming confused by conflicting advice from health professionals and the internet (where ill-informed anti-immunisation propaganda, some influenced by Dr Wakefield, is widely available). In Dublin, the parents of a child who died of complications of measles following the recent outbreak there described their heartbreaking experience. \n\n While Dr Wakefield is due shortly to answer charges of professional misconduct before the General Medical Council, Deer's exposure of the  junk science at the root of the MMR scare  raises questions that\u00a0  go far beyond Wakefield's personal role  in the affair. It is not unprecedented for a scientific researcher to become so convinced that he has made a major discovery that he becomes blind to all evidence to the contrary. Enthusiasm and dedication can easily turn to self-delusion and, once scientific rigour is relaxed, error and confusion are almost inevitable. However, the fact that Dr Wakefield's insubstantial and speculative researches came to have a major public impact suggests a failure of the mechanisms of scientific quality control at a number of levels. \n\n The Royal Free Hospital \nDeer's documentary included footage from the video produced by the Royal Free Hospital to accompany the notorious press conference at which Dr Wakefield's 1998 Lancet paper was launched. \n\n He drew attention to the roles of senior adult gastroenterologist Roy Pounder, Dr Wakefield's boss, and senior paediatric gastroenterologist John Walker-Smith, who had clinical responsibility for the children who were subjected to invasive and distressing investigations in the course of Dr Wakefields's research. Dr Nick Chadwick, a junior member of the research team at the time, recalled how the fact that, using a validated technique, he had failed to find traces of measles virus, in either gut biopsies or cerebrospinal fluid specimens of the children included in the Lancet study, was ignored by Dr Wakefield and omitted from the published paper. Dr Chadwick described Dr Wakefield as a charismatic team leader who simply dismissed his findings. Were Professors Pounder and Walker-Smith (both now retired, but still active in medical affairs) also captivated by the Wakefield charisma? \n\n As dean of the medical school, Professor Arie Zuckerman authorised the promotional video and presided over the press conference (the medical school was also named on Dr Wakefield's patent applications). It seems that some senior figures were prepared to indulge Dr Wakefield's activities, particularly if these brought a higher media profile to the flagging teaching hospital. (In the event, the resulting bad publicity contributed to the demise of the independent Royal Free medical school, which was subsequently assimilated into the University College consortium.) \n\n The Lancet \nThe role of the Lancet in the MMR affair came under intense scrutiny earlier this year when Deer revealed in The Sunday Times that Dr Wakefield had failed to declare a conflict of interest arising from his receipt of a grant of \u00a310,000 from the legal aid board to investigate some of the same children included in the Lancet paper. \n\n As a result, 10 of the co-authors retracted the suggestion of a link between MMR and the distinctive inflammatory bowel condition they claimed to have identified in 12 children with autism or other developmental disorders. Yet, irrespective of the conflict of interest, the question of why the Lancet published such an insubstantial and speculative paper remains unanswered (even in the recent book on the subject by the Lancet's editor Richard Horton - see MMR: 'A reparation, of sorts'). The failure of the Lancet's peer review process gave legitimacy to Dr Wakefield's campaign against MMR, with damaging consequences for families of children with autism and public health. \n\n The medical establishment \nWhen asked to comment on the product patented by Dr Wakefield for the treatment of children with autism and inflammatory bowel disease (involving measles virus, the white blood cells of mice, and goats' milk), leading gut immunologist Tom Macdonald described the recipe as 'total bollocks' (1). Interviewed by Deer at a recent conference at Oxford, a number of international authorities also shook their heads over the patent, pronouncing it 'strange', and 'very strange'. \n\n But the details of these patents only confirm what was apparent to experts in the field from the outset. A glance at the Lancet paper reveals a reference to the work of  Hugh Fudenberg , described by Deer as 'the grandfather of the MMR scare', well known in the USA for the  dubious practices  exposed in Deer's film. (The paper also includes references to other purveyors of unproven tests and treatments, including\u00a0  Vijendra Singh  and  Sudhir Gupta  in the USA, and  Paul Shattock  in the UK.) \n\n What is really strange is the fact that it has taken nearly seven years since the publication of the Lancet paper for senior figures in the medical world to state in public what they have been saying in private since the outset. Meanwhile, largely as a result of the Wakefield campaign, the uptake of MMR has gradually declined to a level that makes outbreaks of measles and other diseases likely. \n\n Contrary to the view promoted by the anti-MMR campaign that their champion has been vilified and censored by the medical establishment, the real problem is that leading authorities in the relevant fields have been very reluctant to challenge publicly the baseless claims made by Dr Wakefield and his supporters. In Deer's film, molecular biologist Professor Ian Bruce, an early collaborator with Dr Wakefield, endorsed Dr Chadwick's findings and conceded that he 'should have said something' to deter the MMR scare that resulted from Dr Wakefield's flawed research. Dr Chadwick indicated that, as a junior member of the team, he felt unable to blow the whistle on Dr Wakefield's violation of basic scientific principles. \n\n In Deer's film the autism authority Pat Howlin denounced the charlatans (some linked to the Wakefield campaign) who are making money out of vulnerable parents of children with autism by selling extravagantly priced preparations of vitamins and amino acids, colostrum and secretin, and other ingredients of unproven efficacy (and unknown adverse effects). Though this was a welcome statement, it is striking how late in the day leading figures in the world of autism have emerged to take a public stand in response to the campaign against MMR and its associated abuses. \n\n It seems that the vociferous and well-organised group of parents supporting the Wakefield campaign have effectively intimidated many of the prominent authorities in the field. The consequence of appeasing these parents have been serious, not least for those who have been drawn into the protracted process of litigation, from which they have emerged, inevitably, with nothing. Making parents feel unwarranted guilt about having given their children MMR has caused widespread distress. \n\n If Deer's film reveals the feebleness of many medical authorities in responding to the challenge of Dr Wakefield's junk science, it also offers some vindication for the small group of doctors who have taken a consistent and robust stand in defence of the interests of child health in general and of children with autism in particular. While Dr Wakefield has been lionised in the press and on television, these doctors have been subjected to scurrilous personal abuse, particularly through the internet. They include community paediatricians Brent Taylor, David Elliman and Helen Bedford, vaccine specialists Elizabeth Miller and David Salisbury, and, from the world of autism, Christopher Gillberg and Eric Fombonne. \n\n Brian Deer has gone some way towards redeeming the reputation of the media, which has generally served the public poorly in the MMR controversy. \n\n Dr Michael Fitzpatrick is the author of MMR and Autism: What Parents Need to Know, Routledge, 2004 (buy this book from Amazon (UK) or Amazon (USA)); and The Tyranny of Health: Doctors and the Regulation of Lifestyle, Routledge, 2000 (buy this book from Amazon UK or Amazon USA). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n                         \n                        \n\n\t\t\n\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/youandyours/features/autism.shtml", "http://www.dsq-sds.org/_articles_html/2004/fall/dsq_fall04_rev-kriske.html", "http://briandeer.com/wakefield-deer.htm", "http://www.spiked-online.com/Printable/0000000CA7C7.htm", "http://briandeer.com/", "http://briandeer.com/wakefield-deer.htm", "http://briandeer.com/wakefield/transfer-factor.htm", "http://64.41.99.118/vran/vaccines/autism/aut_mmr.htm", "http://briandeer.com/mmr/andrew-wakefield.htm", "http://www.nitrf.org/fudenberg.html", "http://www.nitrf.org/autistic.html", "http://libnt2.lib.tcu.edu/staff/lruede/singhfeature.html", "http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/18/14/10.html", "http://www.fabresearch.org/view_item.aspx?item_id=3"], "link": "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2004/11/autism_spectrum.html", "title": "MMR and Autism: No Link at All--How The World Was Hoodwinked by Wakefield"}
