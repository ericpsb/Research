Etc. etc. And for C the array of senses that stimming and self-injury creates.\n\nMany people are hypersensitive and/or hyposensitive. C lives in a very sensory world. And depending how he feels at any one time depends how he handles filtering the flood of sensory information. This can be overwhelming and cause C to fragment resulting in him hurting himself to try and block out the huge sensory distress.\n\nAs C has become older he has learnt different ways to self-regulate his environment when he can to cut out some of the bombardment. Fingers firmly in ears, poking his fingers in his eyes, humming and of course banging his head to block out some of the sensory pain and makes other people control the sensory input around him if they can.\n\nSo to have a room - a haven an oasis of calm where one can go to chill out, to relax, to process info in a controlled safe secure environment for people with huge sensory integration issues is sooo beneficial on many different levels. \n\nThe Sensory room that C goes to regularly because of cuts reform has closed which means not just one less activity for C but an activity that C got a lot out of.\n\n\nThere are different types of Multi-sensory rooms \n\nWhite rooms \n\nDark rooms \nCan calm or energise\nA fab place to do some Intensive Interaction.\nResearch around these rooms has proved beneficial for pain control, ageing, mental health, strokes, brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorders, Alzheimer\u2019s and autism with less aggression and self injury.\n\nThese rooms enhance development of senses such as hearing, sight, smell, touch, memory and attention. They encourage spatial awareness, concentration, relaxation, imagination and alertness improving communication and vocalisation. Motor and cognitive development. \n\nThey can improve mood which gives you respite from overwhelming sensations and continuous self-regulating so restoring your spoons, balancing health and harmony.\n\nI think we could all use some of that!\n\nSo instead of being upset about C\u2019s sensory room closing it gave me an idea that I am very excited about. C\u2019s home has a disused double garage which would be perfect for a multi-sensory room. And would mean C and his house mates could benefit from it every day as and when needed. \n\nSo I have started to look for grants. And am researching alternative cheaper options for some of the fantastic equipment that you can get these days. All ideas welcome. Have you a favorite?\n\nIt\u2019s a positive project to do in times of cuts reform as they are already impacting on C\u2019s life. And a positive project working together with the other parents and staff to benefit everyone :)\u00a0\u00a0 \n\ufeff\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://edge.org/memberbio/barry_c_smith", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception", "http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/autism_world/96543", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_integration_dysfunction", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yViemv3SZoA/TdfjnLA8WoI/AAAAAAAAD4A/5IVUKx0Mxdc/s1600/Casdoksensoryroom.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-29CU10GmuAk/TdfjtbwyiGI/AAAAAAAAD4E/cDmpzG90wnI/s1600/Shrekwhiteroom.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-00-rUXIGX3M/TdfjzC6tpKI/AAAAAAAAD4I/IzvY-EuogS8/s1600/ShrekCasdokroom.jpg", "http://www.intensiveinteraction.co.uk/", "http://www.flaghouse.com/settings_AL.asp#developmental", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoezelen", "http://www.grantsexpert.co.uk/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2011/05/sensory-rooms.html", "title": "\nSensory Rooms\n"},

Disability Hate Crime.\n\nI did not realise that people calling C names or expressing hateful opinions about C is verbal abuse \u2013 and is a Hate Crime. Over the years I have accepted the staring, muttering, making comments as part of C\u2019s life. Not only did\u00a0I accept it but I expect it every time I take C out. It is part of our lives that I have had to get used to so it doesn\u2019t get to me. Thankfully C is oblivious to it (as far as I can tell)\nThis is the type of prejudice that inspired me to write my rap \u2013 if C could speak.C\u2019s invisible disability is very visible! And there have been times I\u2019ve felt harassed and in danger.\n\n\n\nI recently had some training in Disability Hate Crime which touched on genocide. And with Panorama still fresh in my mind I have decided no more! The kids/adults\u00a0muttering abuse \u2013 calling C names (and we live in a respectable area) have been getting away with it as I have been ignoring it I now realise could be the predatory corrupt caregivers - the emotional and physical abusers of tomorrow.\n\nDisability hate crime is a direct attack on a person's identity and an infringement of their human rights, perceived by the person or any other person. \nIt doesn\u2019t matter that the person doesn\u2019t understand it.\n\nThere have many headlines over the years of the failure of the police, prosecutors and some care organisations to take Disability Hate Crime seriously. Fiona Pilkington being a very high profile case \u2013 after it was too late. A mother who killed herself and her daughter because no one listened.\n\nUnless we as a society recognise what disability hate crime is and start reporting it nothing will change.\n\nI reported my first Hate Crime last week and was impressed with how the local police dealt with it. They couldn\u2019t follow it up but it has been added to the statistics \u2013 I\u2019m sure I will be adding many more.\n\nBy reporting\u00a0this will help the police get a better idea of the level of hate crime in your local area and improve the way Police respond to it and could prevent escalation of seriousness. More funding and resources maybe allocated.\n\n\nThere are lots of ways you can report a Hate Crime.\nMore information;Disability Hate CrimeRespondRadar Stop Disability Hate Crime surveyMencap.

{"date": "Tuesday, 26 April 2011", "body": "\n\n\nCultural perception of disability has long standing historical influences and has been shaped by fear of the unknown.\n\nAncient Greeks disposed of imperfect babies. The Romans would throw disfigured children under horse\u2019s hooves in games in the Coliseum. Witches were identified by their impairments or by giving birth to disabled children and burnt at the stakes. Changeling children were drowned. Ridiculed as Court Jesters and the village idiot. Differences were caused by maternal imagination if frightened when pregnant, sexual immorality, astrological factors and divine punishment of parent sins. \n\nFear of the unknown - difference \u2013 do we still have that excuse today?\n\nHomes for the elderly reminiscent of the images of the old asylum\u2019s still haunt us. Derogatory, demeaning, dehumanizing. It is still \u2018them and us\u2019. Frightening as we don\u2019t want it for ourselves so we ignore it. 70% of us will become disabled as we age.\n\nWe in theory have come far from exorcism, bleeding, leeches, cupping, electric shocks, lobotomy and worse. Or have we?\u00a0There are many therapies and treatments out there\u00a0and some parents want to cure their child. This is\u00a0one of the reasons the disability\u00a0movement have not always seen eye to eye with the carer's movement. \n\nDisability is a product of how we have set our society up. Discrimination, bullying, abuse, hate crime\u00a0and oppression\u00a0are still with us. We still struggle with getting on to transport, getting jobs, getting into buildings, communication.\u00a0Many families/people still feel they can\u2019t go out. Cutting benefits and services adds to the perception of burden that our society has to bear adding to the barriers of prejudice and ignorance. Keeping people stuck in the cycle of institutionalisation and dependency.\u00a0 \n\nMany charities still exploit pity. Language is bias as we still use such words as; special, client, victim, user, marginalised, suffers from etc.\u00a0We want to hear about independence, participation, inclusion, choice and more... \n\n\u00a0Everyday words.\n\nWith social networking\u00a0diversity\u00a0is talked about so let\u2019s use words that are inclusive for everyone. This is one small change we can all do which will make a huge difference.\n\nIt\u2019s not about political correctness or being\u00a0positive or even raising awareness\u00a0it\u2019s about respect and equality for all.

{"date": "Monday, 7 March 2011", "body": "\nThere are many forms of self injurious behaviour (SIB). C has tried\u00a0lots over the years, biting, scratching, pinching, eye poking, hair pulling\u00a0to name a few\u00a0but non have worked so well for him as banging his head.\n\nNot much research has been done into head banging \u2013 I know I have been looking for over 21 years! But we do hear of the accumulative affects it can have on boxers,\u00a0 footballers and\u00a0music head bangers.\n\n20% of babies head bang the majority grow out of it. C didn\u2019t as for him it serves a number of purposes. Expressing feelings. Communicating a need - gaining control because of the actions of others, something in his environment, to feel grounded, distraction from sensory pain, distraction from a health pain, emotional pain, lack of self-esteem, self-confidence, expressing fear, frustration, despair, anxiety, anxiety exposure, pressure, avoidance, wanting something, releasing adrenalin or endorphins\u00a0(feels good!). Etc. C of course is a person first and not a collection of behaviours/labels.\n\nI realised very early on that because of my mother\u2019s instinct to protect my child from pain I would give into C\u2019s SIB and other challenging stuff rather than trying to teach him other coping strategies/ways to communicate. At the time it was easier \u2013 for ME. But I realised long term this was not the right route to take for C. In those days local SLD schools did not have enough knowledge, so I fought hard to get C into a specialist school. I am very glad I did as over the years with consistency, understanding and hard work C has made huge strides and we don\u2019t see many of his childhood behaviours now. \n\nBecause head banging for C covers so much it is not always easy to\u00a0know what he is trying to tell you. And its not for lack of him trying. All behaviour is for a reason. It\u2019s a coping strategy a way of communicating, but\u00a0C does rely on\u00a0others to work it out and then sort it out. And because we don\u2019t always get it right as we literally don\u2019t know what he\u2019s trying to tell us \u2018we\u2019 end up shaping his behaviour. \"Suit you, sir?\"\u00a0 \n\nAs C has become older, bigger stronger so his need to find hard surfaces to hit his head on has increased. Possibly as his skull has thickened where he hits it? Or possibly the sensory pain from his environment has increased for him? Or he is less tolerant as to the speed we can work out what he\u2019s saying? I don\u2019t know. \n\n'Autism is anxiety looking for a target' Tony Attwood\nDoors are not hard enough \u2013 they give\u00a0 \n\nAs do tiles\n\nAs do walls\nC now targets sinks and door frames as they are solid.\n\nWe are looking at\u00a0how to make door frames safer - its not straight forward because of fire regs.\nC\u00a0won\u2019t wear a helmet. He cuts his head open on the edges of door frames - \u00a0but won\u2019t let\u00a0anyone cut his nails. Shows how diverse sensory issues can be.\n\nIt is very frightening this need to escalate.\u00a0And we must be careful not to allow our own fears to shrink C\u2019s world \u2013 it\u2019s something C and I have worked hard on over the years to open up.\n\nSo we need to continue working together on helping C learn other coping strategies, choices\u00a0and ways to communicate his needs.\u00a0C is fortunate he has a team to help him and I am a\u00a0cog in 'Team C'. ( Carers are now getting better recognition as expert care partners and valued\u00a0as we have historical holistic knowledge) We continue building C\u2019s community and our understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thecbf.org.uk/chall-behaviour/self-inj.htm", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945234/", "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article827839.ece", "http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Headbanging-Linked-To-Serious-Brain-Damage-Whiplash-And-Strokes/Article/200812315186295?f=rss", "http://www.babycenter.com/0_head-banging_11554.bc", "http://www.donnawilliams.net/exposureanxiety.0.html", "http://www.paradigm-uk.org/Resources/d/2/v/suits_you.pdf", "http://www.tonyattwood.com.au/", "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IqYqOHVzinU/TXJ4Lv7x_yI/AAAAAAAAD24/B5BB_yI7Ceo/s1600/Casdokhb+004.jpg", "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YLbz-GI9VF4/TXJ4RiCP4EI/AAAAAAAAD28/deDUSobnAFg/s1600/Casdokhb+005.jpg", "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-z1KCKTQTKFc/TXJ3_aNKV6I/AAAAAAAAD20/3Y0LMNsNues/s1600/Casdokhb1.jpg", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RVkAbq0GMJU/TXJ4dQe5R7I/AAAAAAAAD3A/50M8B7cjAq4/s1600/Casdokhb+003.jpg", "http://www.firesafe.org.uk/html/premises/reshomes.htm", "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-U8iH1d7Ca9s/TXJ8OCSmbqI/AAAAAAAAD3E/_4rOQ8lTW-A/s1600/morenails+007.jpg", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20500784", "http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_122383.pdf", "http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_122393.pdf", "http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_121668.pdf"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2011/03/walls-are-not-hard-enough.html", "title": "\nWalls are not hard enough\n"},

But all these couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\nMaybe that\u2019s a blog post for another day.\n\n\nPeople also make assumptions about residential homes which have been reinforced by the recent Panorama undercover care programme that all homes are like this - it\u2019s the tip of the ice burg.\nAs a parent respect, dignity and value are not only vitally important for C but for his staff as well. They are C\u2019s backbone and a reflection of how C is doing. \nMy way of supporting and building relationships was to set up a parent forum who meets regularly, this helps with communication, transparency and trust. Working together. \n\nC\u2019s service provider has just sent out a response about the programme to all the family carers to reassure us about their commitment. And a senior manager has sent me a more personal account to share;\n\nIt\u2019s the evening of Tuesday 31st May just after 9pm, I\u2019m listening to the radio and working my way through a big pile of ironing. I get a text from a journalist friend \u201cR U watching this care thing on Panorama, its horrible\u201d. I suddenly remember a colleague last week telling me about an expos\u00e9 on a care home and I\u2019d forgotten, so dash to switch on and suddenly I am gripped to the TV, the longer I watch a tightness spreads over my stomach and I\u2019m overcome with a helpless anger. Over and over in my head then out loud at the TV screen \u201cwhy the bloody hell are you just standing there?\u201d I shout at the care staff on the TV. I\u2019m angry at the journalist, I\u2019m angry at the staff, my mind races as the mobile texts start flooding in, one then another then another.... \n\nI work in social care for an organisation which has more than 10 care homes and a supported living agency serving people with challenging behaviour and learning difficulties. I work with many people who didn\u2019t understand that night why they were watching the staff in a modern day care home abusing vulnerable human life in a way they wouldn\u2019t treat a rabid dog.\n\nI start to read the text which range from Care Home Managers, Deputy Managers and Care Staff and external colleagues, my friends too all astonished at the ghastly images they are viewing. I get text from these sweet people telling me of their tears and sadness, all of them asking \u2018why?\u2019 \n\nThe programme ends and I get a text from a Male Manager whom I respect for his outstanding commitment to the human rights of the people he serves, his text reads \u201cwell that makes us all look shit\u201d. My response is to comfort the staff and tell them they should be proud of what they deliver and that they are always transparent. I am so thankful I chose to work for this organisation and that our systems are so hot on safeguarding. \n\nI get ready for bed feeling saddened that despite all the lessons that should have been learned, abuse of that magnitude is still taking place. It goes round and around in my head whilst I can\u2019t sleep; all those people in that room witnessing; what is wrong with people? If I were being kicked in the street would they all walk past?\n\nNext day I arrive at work, my office colleagues begin a day-long dialogue with every visitor and colleague that comes through the door. This continues all day with staff just reaching out for comfort; all the management reassure them; we feel for them as they are scrutinising their practice and scurrying through risk assessments to check they are not depriving people\u2019s liberty, they are all edgy and where they walk with pride in the community on an average day, feel like the world is judging them today.\n\nPeople I work with are recruited because they share the company ethos, we are one of the hardest companies to get a job with and have little turnover, this documentary has made our beautiful fulfilling roles into something tainted and dirty. Yes, it has served a purpose, but day 1 for that journalist should have been enough, that poor person suffered at the hands of people with a need to control because of his greed to further his career. So many people have something to answer to following that programme. I go onto BBC i-player, grab the link and email it to all the managers, just in case anyone missed it, most didn\u2019t and those who did later responded the same. \n\nAs the day progresses I get a couple of emails from families, they are of support for all we do, so my eyes begin to fill and I share the news and others are delighted for this desperate confirmation that not all the world sees social care as a negative.\n\nA few days on and many conversations later our industry is still in shock and still responding. We all pray that senior management of all large organisations have their finger on the pulse because the image of that beautiful and vulnerable life on the TV being tortured and abused will never leave my mind.\n\n\n\nEach one of us could be in a residential home one day. \nIt is up to all of us.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13611089", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DAiLfqRTydA/TekeeBy3ljI/AAAAAAAAD4g/5Ep4I2Qx974/s1600/Casdokabuse.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b011pwt6/Panorama_Undercover_Care_The_Abuse_Exposed/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2011/06/horrific-abuse-exposed-panorama.html", "title": "\nHorrific abuse Exposed - Panorama\n"},

Might even make some people think a bit differenlty??\n\nBut this didn\u2019t seem to be enough\u00a0so had to think of something more. Over the months C has been doing this I\u2019ve tried different colour socks, seamless socks, trainer socks, expensive socks etc. Nothing made a difference and all socks would quickly end up falling down as with C\u2019s impressive nails the elasticity doesn\u2019t last long. It was suggested to put \u2018wrist sweatbands\u2019 over the top of C\u2019s socks.\n\n\n\nWorked a treat :) \n\nIntensive Interaction isn\u2019t just about mirroring but about feelings and motivations of what a person gets out of something. Connecting. Not just speaking their language but understanding it and responding.\n\nSensory? Deep pressure\u00a0(from sweatbands - i did try them on my ankles first to make sure they wouldnt be be too tight) \u00a0\u2013 has a calming comforting soothing affect. Helping to decrease sensory input. C also enjoys brief deep massages \u2013 and really hard quick hugs. And he will wrap himself up tight in a quilt. Large beanbags and hammocks C also finds very calming. I\u2019ve wondered about weighted blankets (but do be\u00a0careful as one young boy died) and hug vests. The blanket cuddle swings look good as do the body socks\n\nBut for now sweat bands are helping.\nSweatbands may also be helpful for people who eat their cuffs \u2013 wish I had thought of that when C was younger!\n\nOr maybe they work as they simply keep his socks up!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FxOAGtnHdV0/TaAfPleX8iI/AAAAAAAAD3s/TpzsbUuK0Hk/s1600/c1+003.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FczmF7TRZw4/TaAfmAlvYgI/AAAAAAAAD3w/QBL4Ra3fnss/s1600/Casdoksox+020.JPG", "http://www.intensiveinteraction.co.uk/", "http://www.usinabus.org.uk/index.htm", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-d0P_7cLxXhw/TaAgNJh7W4I/AAAAAAAAD30/O57NPyA12rY/s1600/C+030.jpg", "http://www.grandin.com/inc/squeeze.html", "http://www.weight2goblankets.co.uk/", "http://www.autism-blog.com/blanket-suffocates-autistic-boy-quebec", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080521174320.htm", "http://dreamgym.wordpress.com/2009/05/07/therapy-cuddle-swing/milega31/", "http://www.laceandfabric.com/Lycra-Spacial-Body-Bag-SpacialSack.htm"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2011/04/deep-pressure.html", "title": "\nDeep pressure\n"},

Its evolving slowly\u00a0- there\u2019s a cultural shift towards personalization and our expectations are higher than ever. I believe personalisation can be achieved in small group home settings for those who are more vulnerable or would be too isolated in independent living. With motivated staff\u00a0- flexibility and creative thinking of effective and sustainable ways to meet peoples needs and have fun, so as not to stifle life choices just because of a system. NT's take risks everyday! \nRight to Control a 2 year pilot scheme has been launched which builds on personalisation. I have had some training in this so will be interesting to see how it unfolds as the government want to work towards disability equality by 2025.Basic human needs are the same for everyone,\u00a0the way we satisfy them is different as each human lived experience is unique. There are various models of thought on this, I like Maslow\u2019s triangle (without the hierarchy) C relies on others to provide and meet these human needs for his well being to keep his anxiety arousal low so\u00a0C doesn\u2019t drop too many spoons.\n\nMaslow says there are 5 groups of needs to be met to achieve personal growth and maintain a satisfying life - in simple terms..\u00a0 \n\n\nPhysiological \nAir. Food. Water. Sleep. Bodily comforts. Activity \u2013 sensory and motor stimulation includes physical exercise, and rest. Sensory diet.\u00a0 \n\nSecurity\nTo feel safe. Protected from harm (from self and others. Sensory etc). Laws. Stability. Structure. Routine. Sanctuary in own personal space. Financial security. \n\nSocial\nLove. Affection. Belonging. Acceptance and understanding. Family. Staff. House mates. Sense of community. Member of a group. Opportunity. \n\nEsteem.\nDignity. Value. Respect. Freedom. Choice. Control. Empowerment. Competent. Confidence. Achievement. Learning. Meaningful activities\u00a0- Active support. \n\nSelf Evaluating\nThe best life you can have.\nReaching your full potential.\nMaking the most of your unique abilities.\nAt peace with yourself.\n\nThe thought is we\u00a0all have these same groups =\u00a0I've just given interpretations of some of the needs I found on different Maslow triangles.\nWe are motivated by different needs at different times in our lives. I am also mindful of different climates, cultures and economic developments around the world.\n\nC has to solely rely on other people for his most basic of\u00a0 needs for achieving and maintaining\u00a0harmony - the result of his social and physical environment can unbalance his needs being met and makes C self-injure.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nSo when you have physically rebuilt some of C\u2019s environment, changed everything you can, tried to rule out health needs, looked at communication profiles and if there is nothing else you can do maybe it is time to explore the option of medication so C has now been referred to see a psychiatrist.\u00a0\u00a0 \nC is\u00a0depending on us to meet his needs to keep him safe and give him the best life he can have.\u00a0\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/key-projects/care-and-support/access-to-advocacy-and-personalisation/", "http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_92.htm", "http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/docs/wor/rtc/rtc-signposting.pdf", "http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/equality-2025/index.php/default.asp", "http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vUE2I3v-OIM/TYZDUTVbAeI/AAAAAAAAD3g/QPqzMXr_ev8/s1600/Casdoktriangle4.jpg", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20500784", "http://www.sensory-processing-disorder.com/sensory-diet.html", "http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/key-projects/care-and-support/", "http://www.kent.ac.uk/tizard/staff/documents/Mansell%202002%20RDD%20Engagement%20and%20active%20support%20preprint.pdf", "http://www.personcentredactivesupport.com/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2011/03/balance.html", "title": "\nBalance\n"},

Other parents have too many issues and I shouldn\u2019t take them on (I was only\u00a0suggesting lunch!) That there is something missing in me and that I should walk away leaving C to \u2018highly trained\u2019 staff and get on with my life. \u2018That\u2019 he said would be the best thing I can do for C. Stop being a martyr. Apparently I have a build up of years of grief, guilt and denial. I have co dependency issues, control issues and am over protective (maybe some parents have good reason) I should accept that this is \u2018it\u2019 for C and not to want any more for him. Staff are not there to befriend \u2018clients\u2019 or parents. It is a job. It is not about family. If your son was normal and went to university you wouldn\u2019t know what he was getting up to.

{"date": "Saturday, 6 November 2010", "body": "\n\nDear Bendy Girl\n\n\nI recently went to a fascinating talk given by Neil Coyle Director of Policy of the Disability Alliance (DA). Their aim is to break the link between poverty and disability. \n\nSome of the talk was around the\u00a0background\u00a0of where we are now and how the Dynamic Benefits led to the creation in Government of the 21st Century Welfare and their principles.\n\nAs you know the \u2018potential improvements\u2019 to our benefit system include a Universal Credit \u2013 a one size fits all model. A savings generator rather than to transform people\u2019s lives and tackle poverty.\n\nNo mention of support, genuine job opportunities, supporting employers, sustainable or even enough work etc etc (Statistics can be found here). \n\nWe are all in this together! Disabled people did not start in an equal position. Disabled people are twice as likely to live in poverty already. \n\nThe DA need real people to speak up before the total effect of changes has such a devastating impact \u2013 case studies are essential. \nSo Bendy Girl I sent Neil Coyle your The Broken of Britain (A collection of real life stories) website which he said was very useful and he would be happy to add something to the site when they launch the research on DLA. (Dont worry i will remind him!)\nSo if we could urge people to send you their\u00a0personal stories it could help make a difference.\n\n\nNeil also urged that we all of course work with local councillors and MPs to highlight the impact of the proposals.\n\nACT NOW has put together an Impact Assessment report regarding the proposed cuts in public spending on people with Autism.\nDisability Now warns of hard times ahead.\nAnd the Ouch message boards\u00a0are bursting!\n\nDraft letter you can adapt and send to your MP\n\ufeff \u00a0 \u00a0 I recently went on a one day Campaigning course \u2013 here\u00a0is a brief summary of my notes which may help anyone wanting to take any of these issues further. \nGood campaigns run by local people can make make a difference. \n\nYou need to ensure your aims and objectives are clear and concise. \nSMART - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound\n\nGather accurate information and evidence to support your case. \nExamples include personal stories, questionnaires and surveys, good practice examples and relevant local or national statistics.\n\nTiming is important, find out when to start influencing the decision makers. \n\nLobbying your local council. You can influence your council in a number of ways:\nContact your local Councillor. Use the Opposition. Use the Local Paper. Submit a Petition: Lobby the Leader, Executive and Cabinet, and use your local MP Locally and Nationally. \n\nUse local media. When it works well, local media can be extremely useful in advertising your campaign to a wider audience. It can influence key decisions made by a range of people including, local councillors, MPs, business people and even help change public opinion. \nIt\u2019s all in the first sentence \u2013 you need to sum up as much of your story in one sentence as possible and answer the questions: who, what, when, where, why and how. This is a great way to check if your story is news. If you can't sum it up concisely in a few lines of text, then perhaps it's not a news story.\n\nHave a good sound bite. You can either put this in a quote in a press release. It\u00a0can capture the imagination and get you more coverage\u00a0and impact. \n\nLetters to the editor. The letters to the editor pages are some of the best read pages in local papers. If you do send a letter, brief friends and colleagues so that when your letter is printed, they can respond and keep the story going. If the newspaper receives a number of letters on one issue, then it might prompt them to do a news item or a feature. \nPhone-ins.These are the radio equivalent of letters to the editor. \n\nCampaign stunts are effective way of getting media and public attention.\nC and i will have to think of something!

I should have anticipated this\u00a0in the light of the \nI Exist NAS campaign. But I didn\u2019t and I am struggling with what adult services have to offer from what I have seen so far for someone with C\u2019s level of ability and challenges (no disrespect to staff as I know they are doing their best with the training they have)\nC went to a specialist school. It was full on \u2013 he had access to many basic therapies, was a part of a thriving community and the curriculum was geared to him. Lots of access to different opportunities/experiences. He leaves school and we fall off the cliff. All the stress of various battles over the years - all that education and for what? \n\nOr this is what it feels like to me. (And its not supposed to be about me. But after 16 months C is not as settled as i would like him to be)\nI don\u2019t get it. Why do the expectations change in the adult world? Why do old stereotypes \u2018still\u2019 exist? Why don't care homes seem to socially evolve? With all the new regs about dignity, equality,\u00a0human rights acts etc etc why are many attitudes still so out of date?\n\nIs this it for C? \n\nThe universe answered me in the form of an avalanche of emails from bloggers and\u00a0Fb who had seen a promotional video clip\u00a0(I had also seen it but am bowled over at the kindness and thought\u00a0from people letting me know) in a Jessica Kingsley Publishers newsletter - Phoebe Caldwell about Intensive Interaction. \n\n \nSomething I had never heard of. But something I unknowingly do naturally with C. A good example is the post\u00a0I wrote about C\u2019s and my first clubbing experience. I have now read every book ever written on the subject and through googling I found a local organization that run workshops\u00a0using Intensive Interaction! I went to one of their meetings for practitioners across the SE and sat there overwhelmed -\u00a0stunned - \u00a0fighting back the tears listening to their stories that here were a group of people passionate about making a difference to 'pre-verbal' people\u2019s lives. \n\nAt the same time as this was unfolding I was in talks with C\u2019s service provider about \u2013 'is this it for C'. And the service manager asked me what they could do \u2013 out of my handbag I produced an Intensive Interaction book. She had heard of it so I pushed my luck a bit further and produced an application form for a workshop. \n\nThey are sending 4 staff on the course. As you can imagine I am over the moon. I am also going on the course \u2013\u00a0and am\u00a0really looking forward to \u2018working together\u2019 with staff and with C.\n\nAll this came about through blogging. Through chance. Something I will not leave C\u2019s future too.\nSo thank you everyone. I will keep you posted how it goes. \n\nA new year and I hope a new beginning.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/TSStX2o6LoI/AAAAAAAAD10/-nyA4E5RQIw/s1600/falling-Casdok.jpg", "http://www.dimensions-uk.org/", "http://www.autism.org.uk/get-involved/campaign-for-change/our-campaigns/i-exist.aspx", "http://www.jkp.com/", "http://www.jkp.com/blog/2010/08/video-clips-from-phoebe-caldwells-new-training-dvd-autism-and-intensive-interaction/", "http://www.usinabus.org.uk/", "http://www.intensiveinteraction.co.uk/about/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/TSSwTypfEcI/AAAAAAAAD14/5F0hFGmiCm4/s1600/Casdok-C.JPG"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2011/01/chance.html", "title": "\nChance\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, 18 November 2010", "body": "\nAutistic with spoons? Autism and spoons? Here\u2019s my attempt at a variation on the spoon theory.\nWe all have spoons. There are no stereotypes for spoons. Everyone\u2019s spoons are different, everyone has a different numbers of spoons which fluxuate. Everyone uses their spoons in different ways. And maybe your spoons don\u2019t even look like spoons! \nI think I know my own spoons quite well, I have learnt to recognise (and respect) them as I have become older. Some spoons I can hide. C seems to know when I have lost a few spoons!\n\nAnd C\u2019s spoons from motherly intuition and my perception of them over many years I have some sort of idea. But I have no idea how many C has at any one time. He has ones for many more things than I do - noise, light, colour, smell, sharing personal space, things around him, movements, processing, feelings, thoughts, communicating, bodily functions, positions, health, head banging, keeping clothes on, standing up, rocking, flicking, eye poking - and many many others I just have no clue to. Nor no clue as to how they really affect him. Before during and after juggling.\n\n\nSome days C is better at juggling his spoons than others.\n\nSome days he may have woken up with fewer or more spoons than usual?\n\nSome days some spoons maybe bigger than shovels and\u00a0C is intensely aware of spoons that he can usually ignore.\n\nSocial interactions for C uses up lots of spoons so he very rarely does it and then only if he has spoons in abundance. Making him \u2018appear\u2019 severely socially isolated.\n\nC\u2019s spoons do not conform to many NT spoon rules. C\u2019s spoons can be extreme - obvious or invisible. C\u2019s spoons like to keep me on my toes :)\n\nSome days C drops his spoons one by one \u2013 if I have been watching closely I can see this happening and sometimes I can distract him, divert him or remove him where possible before he loses too many.\n\nWe have both learnt different tactics for clutching on to the few remaining spoons. C learnt to put his fingers in his ears, to hum, to rock, to focus on an object (used to be a chopstick now it\u2019s his thumb nail). \n\nI have learnt where to position him, distract him with my predictable movements or by mirroring him, using behaviours he recognises, or maybe playful \u2018ritualised exchanges\u2019 like I kiss him on the nose with my finger. This seems to sometimes ground him (if he hasn\u2019t lost too many spoons by then) or my making happy sounds that he makes. Looking deep in his eyes - Positive and reassuring. Etc\n\nBut if C didn\u2019t drop them one by one, if all his spoons just spectacularly crashed and there is nothing he or I can do and he over loads, melts down, fragments \u2013 whatever you like to call it. All I can do to help him is to get him to a safe quiet place to recharge/process/pick up some of his spoons.\n\nAnd I do the same as I also will have lost a few by then.\n\nOn reflection there is always something to learn, something I may have missed. And so the next time I try something slightly different (yet familiar and recognisable). We have built on this and evolved our routines opening up C\u2019s world. I learnt to read the function of some of C\u2019s spoons by being sensitive, mindful, watching and listening. It\u2019s been hard work and some things have taken years - but C\u2019s arsenal of spoons that he can juggle is growing and changing all the time - it has been so worth it and now we can go just about anywhere. And try anything.\n\nWe have a connection. He trusts me even when I get it wrong sometimes and drop the odd spoon.\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory-written-by-christine-miserandino/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/TOTtihN2kWI/AAAAAAAAD0Y/75Qedk_0IRk/s1600/Casdokspoons2.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/TOTs3AnTe2I/AAAAAAAAD0Q/1j5y3EEZ_nk/s1600/alessi_big_love_spoon.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2010/11/autistic-with-spoons.html", "title": "\nAutistic with spoons\n"},

They may have stereotyped or repetitive behaviour such as wishing to sit in the same seat and becoming upset if they cannot.When my PC died, I had to change my routine drastically till I got a new one. I found this very hard!I have a routine round the supermarket, so if they decide to change all the shelves round it completely throws me!Or if I go out without my mobile\u2026\u2026\u2026C lives by routines, he finds change sooo difficult, and results in head banging. Which is very effective as we all try very hard not to change his routines, but things happen and you have to.We have to walk down the same sides of the street, he has to walk behind me. He cant cope if I wear sunglasses, or have my hair cut drastically. He cant cope with changing class rooms or bedrooms. When we moved house it was really hard for him. For example, when getting out of bed in the new house, even though he could see the door, he was still going in the same direction of where the door had been in his old room. Took him about a year.He has to leave boarding school next year. So very big changes all round.So what changes in routine do you have difficulties with? \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/RxHcDSNWjpI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/p6_C8cVtTtA/s1600-h/anxiety_1.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2007/10/routines.html", "title": "\nRoutines\n"},

C is hyper in every sense of the word and doesn\u2019t need much sleep or like sitting down. You sort of get used to it as I know its only for a couple of weeks. And it would be very unfair to sedate him just so I can get some sleep.We thankfully had a quiet uneventful first day. Which is nice as it takes C a few days to adjust to being home. He\u2019s away 5 or 6 weeks then home for 2 weeks. This is supposed to be more consistent as it means we don\u2019t get such a long summer holiday. No local school could handle C, hence I had to look further a field. I ended up travelling the entire country to find a specialist school that I thought he would benefit from (even then they don\u2019t always get it right) Its obviously not ideal but I do believe C is getting a better quality of life this way.A few of you asked about transport. C likes straight lines. We have to walk in a straight line, going round corners he finds distressing, and turning round and going back on your self is a definite no no. And I cant stop and look at anything. C prefers to walk behind me, and im not even allowed to turn round and look at him, all result in head banging. But being a mum I have eyes in the back of my head! The same when driving , forget roundabouts, turning round, going backwards, slowing down, don\u2019t stop at traffic lights or roadwork\u2019s! Head banging in the confines of a car is not a good situation to be in. And I don\u2019t agree with restraints. So trains, \u2018if \u2018they behave are the easiest option! C is still very happy to be home. I give him plenty of space and time out. I try not to put too many demands on him, and try and do things he enjoys, after all it is his holiday and he does need a break from learning to count to 2.

As a parent to see your child hurting them selves is one of the worst things.Last night i had my weekly phone call from Cs boarding school. Because it is the start of a new year they have new students and new staff. C finds change hard, so his incidents and the severity of his headbanging have gone up.Over the years he has cracked walls, broken bathroom tiles, smashed reinforced doors and double glazed windows, TVs. The list could go on. All with his head.He has been head banging since he could sit up, he is now 6 foot. His skull has now hardened, he has 3 calcified oedemas on his head. I'm not sure if this is a good or a bad thing, a thicker skull protects his brain, but it also means he hits harder.When the head banging has been really bad he has given himself concussion, and/or induced fits. It could kill him.It has certainly shaped my behaviour.Some staff find his headbanging very hard to deal with. Understandably. Which is a good thing as then they try everything in their power to prevent it.C has to leave school in this next year. This change will be enormous. I find it very hard to think about it. But when the time comes everything that can be done, will be done to help him.So why does C do it? Its his form of communication. And it is very effective. The trouble is every time it works it is reinforced. Over the years we have tried various other forms of communication, but he is not interested.He even bangs his head when he is happy!But to end on a lighter note, I did speak to C and i heard heavy breathing down the phone!!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/RvLPPcBSrbI/AAAAAAAAAKw/NLy3w3sTkfU/s1600-h/images.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2007/09/head-banging.html", "title": "\nHead banging\n"},

They have also let us in the centre on days when it has been shut and turned the escalators on just for us. How wonderful is that!!C loves watching feet (less threatening than faces!) So he will stand or rather stim (rocking and jumping) for hours just watching. He is so happy doing this.

And the last couple of years he has got really into it.We started off with shows he could relate to, from his DVD collection, like Thomas the Tank engine, Scooby Doo and Bananas in pyjamas. Etc.He has since progressed on to shows like The Blue Man group. This is a really great show and C loves it as they don\u2019t speak and is very visual, we have now been 4 times! The other one is Stomp, again no talking!We get there seconds before the show starts so C doesn\u2019t have to wait and leave just before the end to avoid the crowds.We sit at the end of the row, in case we have to make a fast escape. I have also learnt it is better to sit at the front. We used to sit at the back, but because people keep turning round to see who is squeaking and flapping they were missing the show! So if we sit at the front, people can watch the show and C!

As you can see he was in a flapping frenzy! And doing his Tarzan chest beating impersonations. Here is C outside The Dome, he didnt want to stand still so was pinching himself. Sorry C. Here we are at the rink side, we had a great view. For the first half C did his ostrich impression. Kept putting his head between his ankles (yes ankles) and every now and again would pop up and have a look round and then down he would go.He watched more of the second half out of the corner of his eye!

We sit at the back (as there is more leg room) and I sit away from him, as he prefers space.When the bus goes fast in a straight line he ferociously shakes his head and squeals very loudly. When the bus stops he bangs his head on the window. Of course everyone on the bus turns round to see where the noise is coming from. Because I was sitting on the other side it must have looked like C was on his own.Sitting in front of me was a young boy with blonde hair. He kept watching C out of the corner of his eye, and every now and again would turn round and glare at me.Eventually the young boy asked me in a very curt tone what I was staring at! So I told him I was watching my son enjoying the bus going fast. He looked relieved as he thought I was laughing 'at' C. He then went on to tell me he was one of 7 children, all his 6 brothers and sisters were somewhere on the autistic spectrum. So he had realised that C was autistic, and because he had seen me smiling at C he thought I was laughing at him, and the young boy was going to defend him.A member of the public, defend my son! That has never happened to us before. I was overwhelmed.We carried on chatting, he told me a bit of his life. Suddenly C let out a really loud strange noise, the bus driver stopped, got out and went round the bus to look at the engine!!! Everyone on the bus laughed as we all realised what had happened. The young boy jumped off the bus and went and told the bus driver, as C by this time was not happy that the bus had stopped!!!Soon we were off and soon it was time to get off.I will never forget that young boy who was prepared to stand up for my son. I wish more members of the public would be more understanding.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/RuuWTjVrPkI/AAAAAAAAAIw/qbA3kZfdZ_8/s1600-h/image002.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2007/09/i-met-angel.html", "title": "\nI met an angel\n"},

We all bonded very quickly as we were all there for the same reason (I was the only parentof a disabled child there) There were many incidents along the way, funny ones, dramatic ones,scary ones, drunken ones.

So did I meet the man of my dreams? Did I have a spiritual experience in those mystic mountains?I wish!We were all walking across a dilapidated corrugated iron bridge. Unbeknown to me as I was to busy looking at the stunning scenery there was a hole about 8 inches across, and my foot went down it. I didn\u2019t feel a thing but there was rather a lot of blood, and I couldn\u2019t put any weight on my right foot. (Sorry, its not very dramatic!) We had doctors with us, so they carried me to a safe place and stitched me up on the mountain side. I was given a litre of vodka as I was told I would need it! Which was rather silly really, as you try going to the loo behind rocks tidily on one leg, and no crutches!I was carried the rest of the way of the hike and onto the plane. My mother met me at the airport, she was quite shocked to see me in a wheel chair. We drove straight to the hospital.I had 3 operations in 3 years. 5 years of physio. I spent most of those 3 years in plaster and in a wheel chair as I wasn\u2019t allowed to weight bear. I had severed a main tendon. Each operation failed. I am now left with a right foot that I cannot move which is still painful.I don\u2019t regret going on the hike, and I learnt a few sharp lessons on how the public view people in wheel chairs. They did offer a 4th op, an experimental one, but it was all just to hard round C, I couldn\u2019t face it again.I did this hike in the first couple of years they started doing such things. Now because people have actually died, they are a lot safer.

Inside, you can lose yourself in light and vapour, with visibility down to as little as two feet. It was really weird to go inside. C spends all his life being observed. And he watches, even though you cant see him watching!The allotment here, represents Cs want for things being the same, orderly and routined.C is highly sensitive to touch, light smell, colour, atmosphere, taste.It can be over whelming to him at times.I think this shows graphically how his senses are attacked.C head bangs.

Many autistic people are hypersensitive with all their senses.People hypersensitive to smell cannot tolerate how people or objects smell, though non-autistics maybe unaware of any smell at all. They may run from smells, move away from people and insist on wearing the same clothes all the time. For some, the smell or taste of any food is too strong, and they reject it no matter how hungry they are. C is very much like this, sometimes it takes me days to find something that he will eat.

Others may experience confusion, due to difficulty interpreting the sensation or insufficient sensation reaching the brain to interpret. Another, not uncommon pattern is to have the strength of the sensation inverse from that of the stimulation, so that a gentle touch may feel like an electric shock, but firm contact may not be a problem. Some autistic people may be insensitive to pain, and fail to notice injuries. C finds pain very difficult to interpret, I think that\u2019s one of the reasons he hits his head so hard.Temple Grandin talks a lot about firm touch., and how her discovery of deep pressure ultimately helped her reduce her anxiety's debilitating effects.C doesn\u2019t like being touched, or touching anything, even wearing clothes he just about tolerates.

My conclusion tomorrow!(Unless there are any others you can think of that you would like me to try and cover?)Some people on the autistic spectrum \u2013 appear to have problems seeing things clearly. To them the world may seem disjointed, confused and scary.For example, people and things may seem blurry, move around or even disappear. Visual symptoms of autism can include lack of eye contact, staring at spinning objects or light, fleeting peripheral glances, side viewing, and difficulty attending visually. C does all this!Autistic people often use visual information inefficiently. They have problems coordinating their central and peripheral vision. Ie when asked to follow an object with their eyes, they usually do not look directly at the object. Instead, they will scan or look off to the side of the object. Autistic people might also have difficulty maintaining visual attention.Motor, cognitive, speech, and perceptual abilities can also be affected when visual processing is interrupted.We see colour is all around us. It is a sensation that adds excitement and emotion to our lives. Some autistic people can be sensitive to colours. Everything from the cloths we wear, to the pictures we paint revolves around colour. Without colour the world would be a much less beautiful place. Colour can also be used to describe emotions; we can be red hot, feeling blue, or be green with envy.Without light, there would be no colour.So do you know how you see things?Can you read the number in these circles?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Rx7y1SNWkNI/AAAAAAAAAa4/ZPhrM5hDxdQ/s1600-h/eyeball.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Rx7yLSNWkLI/AAAAAAAAAao/z49RUERCJ6I/s1600-h/colorblind5.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Rx7yQSNWkMI/AAAAAAAAAaw/IaP0A6omwSY/s1600-h/colorblind6.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Rx7x8SNWkII/AAAAAAAAAaQ/Op_c_xGC0Io/s1600-h/colorblind2.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Rx7yBiNWkJI/AAAAAAAAAaY/vnrvjzoTqhA/s1600-h/colorblind3.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Rx7yGyNWkKI/AAAAAAAAAag/a96MRUUWAPU/s1600-h/colorblind4.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Rx7x3CNWkHI/AAAAAAAAAaI/RgrBs7DxXXE/s1600-h/colorblind1.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-do-you-see-world.html", "title": "\nHow do you see the world?\n"},

But it was he who was miserable and not C, C was just being himself!C head bangs, but its not always because he is anxious or miserable, he does it just as hard when he\u2019s happy. I think his pain threshold must be very different, but then there are lots of people like that!C has been abused over the years, ranging from being insulted in the street, ignored, neglected, to physically attacked, indecently assaulted etc.It breaks my heart as he is so gentle (except to himself). Obviously I do what ever is in my power to help him, but I am not always going to be around.Hopefully my blog has given people a better understanding, but you don\u2019t have to understand autism, just accept all people are different.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/RyGZoKqEBFI/AAAAAAAAAbg/V_eTqAiVjxY/s1600-h/wswim28.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/RyGZoKqEBFI/AAAAAAAAAbg/V_eTqAiVjxY/s1600-h/wswim28.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2007/10/acceptance.html", "title": "\nAcceptance\n"},

It seemed to get you all thinking, which is great.I touched on touch Noise RoutinesNot to mention bondage in the shower!SmellsObsessionsSightStimming.And famous people who you maybe would not have thought to be on the spectrum.I had lots of great responses. And as you are now all experts\u2026How would you respond to this\u2026now you know a bit more about autism, how would you describe it? As from your answers we all do these things! Dgibbs also mooted this question here and here. I was asked recently what is autism, and even though my life has revolved round it for the past 19 years, I couldn\u2019t answer! I must have looked pretty daft!! Because C is just C (I have written a poem about it, but I cant spout it every time someone asks!)Dgibbs came up with its 'personal' and for C I see it as just extremes of average. Not sure I really like the word average ( a bit better than \u2018normal\u2019). But it does illustrate the point as with out extremes, there is no average!And 'if' autism is a spectrum, I put it to you that we are all on it somewhere?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Rx-NqyNWkPI/AAAAAAAAAbI/lOWNQGKvsFI/s1600-h/autism.gif", "http://myfavoriteatistic.blogspot.com/2007/10/what-is-autism.html", "http://myfavoriteatistic.blogspot.com/2007/10/what-is-autism-revisited.html", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Rx-NayNWkOI/AAAAAAAAAbA/imCPeEV8Awg/s1600-h/spectrumB0033.gif"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2007/10/what-is-autism.html", "title": "\nWhat is autism?\n"},

Neighbours crossed the street when they saw us coming. I was asked several times if it was catching! It was a long time ago and practically unheard of then. My mother was in denial, and my brothers and sisters all being younger than I am were all away at university getting on with their own lives.C as a young child was very destructive to himself and his surroundings and smeared a lot, so I couldn\u2019t take him to peoples houses, and he wouldn\u2019t let anyone in ours. He didn\u2019t like me talking to people either in person or on the phone. I could only take C to playgrounds when it rained as they would be empty. Even then we emptied shops and cafes, as we still do.My world shrank. I went to support groups, but as other children were not as self injurious as C even those parents avoided us. I ended up running support groups for others, and doing such things as Home start and Face to Face. I also sat on numerous committees. Doing for others was my support.It is well documented that carers become isolated, and I see it in my own life. I have many acquaintances, but few friends. Because C is away at boarding school, I haven\u2019t even got to know the other parents at the school. I do however have one really good friend who has been my life saver and continues to be so. My mother is also of great support. My ex husbands family totally cut us off.And trying to have relationships\u2026...well\u2026....

Well to be honest i couldn't decide!! (I wont be so generous next week!) So everyone who entered can help them selves to this;  Made by Aunt of Shrek (Thank you sis x) And thank you DJKirkby for the idea! I recently did a post on support from family and friends but we are also supported by a variety of professionals.There are some professionals to whom it is just a job, and don\u2019t really understand what they are dealing with (in terms of C that is).Gone are the days where they could come into your house and have a cuppa and really get to know you, your child and your lives. Now problems are dealt with either by email or over the phone. Very rarely do I now see a professional in person.Yes we sometimes give them a hard time, or rather the system a hard time. But it is not personal, and the ones who are good at their job know this.Professionals come and go, the bad ones don\u2019t always last as they cant cope (they actually give me more stress than C does!) and the good ones don\u2019t always last as they get promoted, move on or get pregnant!When a professional has left, if I then see one in the town (as the mother of Shrek I have my radar fully turned on, scanning for stray dogs, small children, bicycles and teenagers who want to torment, and how I am going to manage to keep walking in a straight line (any of these causes C to head bang) I usually spot them before they see us. When they do see us they pretend not to, or turn away or even turn round. I think they think I am going to lynch them or give them the latest update on C. But all I actually want is a smile, an acknowledgement that we did - do matter and exist.But anyway. There are good professionals out there, They don\u2019t pretend to be the experts, they listen to you and really support you. These are the ones who want to make a difference and do care. And their reward? Under paid, over worked and poor working conditions.These professionals are usually the social workers and they get a bad press. The social workers whom if you haven\u2019t tided your house, or if you say you are finding it hard to cope cart your children off into care! This is not the case, if it was C would be in a foster home by now! By having a social worker you are not admitting defeat, you maybe just need that extra support.I have had a few very good social workers in my time, and I thank each of them for going that extra mile and making me feel like a human not a case file.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://djkirkby.blogspot.com/", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/RzszDN_aPdI/AAAAAAAAAh0/Kox2E6H16cg/s1600-h/profesionals.jpg", "http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Residents/Care_Support/LearningDisabilities/", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/RztS3N_aPfI/AAAAAAAAAiE/VeQJJIQfyOA/s1600-h/V32CAV9B8WCCAPLXTB6CAGL390GCAFL025JCAZA2HW1CA6LUDQDCAC7OY4SCAIASEW3CAZRCXKICACDKVBLCAK109Z0CAOS5NAZCAOPV0OGCAI6Y31RCA1C6HAPCAA3GV2BCAML5TPWCAWWT4W0CA92XGEA.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2007/11/social-workers.html", "title": "\nSocial Workers\n"},

And because C used to smear daily, it was a daily nightmare. I would end up wetter than him. There were times when i used to take C to my friends house so her husband could bath him as i was just unable to. Today, aged 19, C loves a bath. I use a lavender bubble bath, candles and music. He will even sometimes take his fingers out of his ears just for a few moments. C is unable to wash himself and still wont allow me to ( if he is in the bath long enough any poo dissolves!)

So if I haven\u2019t got my key or cant find a disabled loo I have to take C in the ladies. Being a 6 foot young man this raises eye brows, but what else can you do?Some disabled toilet doors now work automatically so you cant quickly shut them behind you, as soon as C sees a loo as he works on visual prompts his trousers are down by his knees and the door is still wide open! So I try and avoid these loos.The other kind of toilet I try and avoid are the ones on trains. This is only since a rather embarrassing incident. C had had an accident, I wont go into too much detail but basically I hadn\u2019t locked the loo door properly and a rather red faced woman was standing there mouth open whilst I was kneeling over C sitting on the loo with me trying to pull his trousers off!We have also missed our station a few times as he has decided to stay in there!

{"date": "Thursday, 6 December 2007", "body": "\nIt takes a village to raise a child. I had never heard of this proverb before Suzy sent to me. And thinking about it i think it is so true.This ancient African proverb teaches eternal truth. No man, woman, or family is an island. But in this century, community isn't always what it is supposed to be. We'd all like to think we live in a place where people care about others -- where people pitch in to help when things get rough -- where it's safe to leave the doors unlocked and let the kids play around outside. This isn't always what we experience. Instead of community, we find alienation; looking for safety, we are attacked by crime; hoping for a better life for our kids, we encounter gangs and drugs and the lies of television. People often retreat behind closed and try to ignore their neighbors. Politicians preach envy and hate, dividing us further instead of working for reconciliation. Being poor these days just isn't what it used to be.This affects all our children as times have changedNowadays, children are raised to fear and distrust nearly every adult stranger. Teachers and mentors and members of the community are afraid to say anything critical or to offer any form of correction, lest they be sued or directly attacked by the child\u2019s family. Not only that, moral standards and ideals of excellence are seen as social relics of a past, and so need to be discarded. This most certainly is not the sentiment that gave rise to the African proverb.I think the parents are the primary people responsible for raising the child. That being said, I do think that the \"village\", or people who affect the child's life definitely have a huge impact on how that child turns out, whether it's for the better or worse. People in general never realize the effect they have on others much less a child and should do all they can to ensure the best outcome possible.Does the same go for C?Does C see his life of people shying away from him frightened. So he does the same.Does he think being ignored or verbally abused is the norm? Maybe that\u2019s why he doesn't speak as he doesn't want to be rude to people!Does he think it takes everyone years to be treated for being ill. So he puts up with it. Or just thinks that's the way it is. Etc.It is hardly surprising C knows no better and its not just down to his autism or learning disability.After all children grow up and learn from the \u2018village\u2019 around them.It is happening to all our children.And a thank you to Mootia for my lovely award!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R0boO4Z6JEI/AAAAAAAAAmk/R8PG9ApujVo/s1600-h/village2.jpg", "http://suzy-identitycrisis.blogspot.com/", "http://www.moralhealth.com/blog/_archives/2006/9/6/2300395.html", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R0boVIZ6JFI/AAAAAAAAAms/AaEAcvJ2_Fw/s1600-h/village.jpg", "http://watertrough.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2007/12/it-takes-village-to-raise-child.html", "title": "\nIt takes a village to raise a child\n"},

They would tie him down to restrain him. Or call me up and ask me to collect him early.The local respite home also couldn\u2019t cope with him and he started at the age of 4 going to a home for adults with challenging behaviour. Hardly ideal. There was nothing else in the county.After much talking with Lorna Wing and doing a lot of research. I took the enormous decision to send C to a specialist school as he needed a 24 hour curriculum (he needed more than just 9am to 3pm). There I hoped they would be able to help him as he needed more help than I could give him. And as a mother, like any mother I wanted the best for my son, not just maintaining him, restraining him, and medicating him.I looked far and wide. He was turned down at many places because of his behaviour ( He would knock himself out through headbanging) , so my search became wider. Eventually I found a school, a new school, based on Higashi in the UK that sounded as though it would fit his needs. It took 18 months of battle, but eventually I got him there. The down side was it was so far away.It was not easy to send C there, to leave him in the hands of others. But I put his needs first over mine. I had this hope in my heart they would give him the tools he would need to help himself with his anxieties. And that hope kept me going, even though my heart was breaking.Being in a specialist school has given C more opportunities to access things than he would have been able to locally. More specialist input from speech therapists, music therapy, physiologists etc which are few and far between. The terms are shorter and there are only 6 in his class. With 1 teacher and 5 helpers.I don\u2019t regret my decision I don\u2019t feel guilty and i feel no shame. I didnt 'send him away' because i failed him or couldnt cope. The school has not always been ideal, (but no where would be perfect) they do their best, and parents like me keep them on their toes! I do keep a close eye on them.C has to leave school at the end of this next school year. It has taken me 2 years to find an adult place for him, and one that will accept him. Thankfully it is a lot closer than he is now. But that is a post for another day.There are two things you give your children.

The board being large has meant he has been able to watch other kids using it (a screen on a PC this isn\u2019t so possible) With a white board he can stand, the pictures are large and he can use his whole hand to drag things around, which means he gets an instant action. The potential possibilities of this are enormous (hopefully with his communication).It\u2019s a pity in this respect that he has to leave school soon.If your child\u2019s school hasn\u2019t got one, tell them to get one!!!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R1_SmgJtYVI/AAAAAAAAAx8/33Okmwpk3_0/s1600-h/images.jpg", "http://www.ncld.org/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=466", "http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/uvahealth/peds_orthopaedics/lordosis.cfm", "http://smartboard.co.uk/education/specialed.asp", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R2I0V3wwPyI/AAAAAAAAAzY/avJiC-FOU9c/s1600-h/section1-tvl-backto--media-1-quizX5Fid-zwaterlooX2D12753731907329X2D2194X2D0-u-waterlooX2D12753731907329X2D2194X2D0-z-f.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R1_R5QJtYUI/AAAAAAAAAx0/eNPfZbcGZQk/s1600-h/!!.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2007/12/c-shows-interest.html", "title": "\nC shows an interest!!!!!\n"},

She sat and watched the butterfly for several hours as it struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it seemed to stop making any progress. It appeared as if it had gotten as far as it could, and it could go no further.So the woman decided to help the butterfly. She took a pair of scissors and snipped off the remaining bit of the cocoon.The butterfly then emerged easily. But it had a swollen body and small, shrivelled wings.The woman continued to watch the butterfly because she expected that, at any moment, the wings would enlarge and expand to be able to support the body, which would contract in time.Neither happened! In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a swollen body and shrivelled wings. It never was able to fly. What the woman, in her kindness and haste, did not understand was that the restricting cocoon and the struggle required for the butterfly to get through the tiny opening were nature\u2019s way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings so that it would be ready for flight once it achieved its freedom from the cocoon.Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we are allowed us to go through our lives without any obstacles, it would cripple us.We would not be as strong as what we could have been.We could never fly!

C being a people watcher just loves watching people skate or rather try to.I took a photo on my phone of the Christmas tree there, if your eye sight is really good you can just about see us in the reflection!!Then on to Trafalgar square with a lunch stop at McDonald's. I'm not a fan of McDs, but C hasn't been eating much this hols and i can guarantee he will eat their fries! We also went to the loo there, they still haven't replaced the tiles C smashed with his head from last time we were there! Thankfully no repeat performance this time!As you can see Trafalgar Square was getting ready for New Years eve, with big screens and fencing off the water from revelers! Am not looking forward to tonight as C finds the noise of fireworks really distressing and there is not a lot i can do about it.We then walked down past number 10 and on to Big Ben. It was packed.

But in social terms, absolute honesty can lead to trouble, risking causing offense to others who may not want or need to hear the complete truth. White lies may be desirable.\u201d I Cannot Tell a Lie - what people with autism can tell us about honesty By Simon Baron-Cohen  'Autistic people find it hard to lie and find it difficult to tell if you are deceiving them, as they are literal thinkers.' But I know autistic people who are really good at lying! So am a bit confused on this point.I\u2019m not good a big lies. But little white ones I'm an expert! When someone asks me how I am I nearly always say, 'I'm fine thanks.' Even if I have spent half the night cleaning shit off the ceiling, and trying to advert a head banging frenzy, I've had to throw away my latest culinary master piece that I really thought he would eat this time, or trying not to be upset when I have heard someone mutter something derogatory about my son as they walk past. And Ive had only 4 hours sleep in 2 days. I\u2019ve just found it easier to smile and say I\u2019m fine! How To Spot a Liar:1. No eye contact. His eyes will look away. If the room has a means of egress - that's where they'll look.2. Crossing of arms and/or legs (a protective instinct).3. The pupils of the eyes will narrow. Lying is stressful.4. Hands on the face, especially the mouth. They are \"covering\" the lie.5. Talking fast. A liar wants to get it over with.6. Sometimes the head will nod a \"no\" when answering a \"yes\" question or visa versa. This is a subconscious movement.7. Mispronouncing the words or mumbling. A liar kind of thinks he is not lying when he pronounces words incorrectly or mumbles.8. Overstated friendliness/laughing. He wants you to believe and he wants you to like him so you will believe him.Here's an How honest are you quiz.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R3_WBHwwRmI/AAAAAAAABB4/SRh-kBjdB3Y/s1600-h/Fatbottomgirls.jpg", "http://www.forbes.com/2005/10/19/lying-dishonesty-psychology_cx_lr_comm05_1024lie.html", "http://www.incharacter.org/article.php?article=101", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R4EqoXwwRtI/AAAAAAAABCw/MxtOB5x9oB4/s1600-h/mask.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R3_XEHwwRnI/AAAAAAAABCA/9LvaKlVWb0s/s1600-h/pinoc.jpg", "http://teenadvice.about.com/library/teenquiz/blhonestyouquiz.htm"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/01/honesty-is-vertue-or-is-it.html", "title": "\nHonesty is a vertue or is it?\n"},

I was on one of the committees that helped close this psychiatric hospital down. I will never forget my first tour round the challenging behaviour units there. It is a constant reminder to me how even when we think how unfair our world today is to our children, how fortunate we really are. It wasn\u2019t that long ago. The first hospital of this kind in the UK was founded in 1247. Some people were sent there in their youth for 'crimes' such as being epileptic, an unmarried mother stealing to feed their families or becoming prostitutes to maintain their children after being deserted by their husbands. It became infamous for its harsh treatment of the insane. Visitors could come and observe the lunatics- entry to the freak shows were free on Tuesdays. Visitors could bring sticks and poke the inmates to enrage them. As early as the 1600's witchcraft and demonic possession were also considered explanations for lunacy.Supernatural powers were summoned to treat such persons incorporating rituals of atonement and purification.'Lunatics' fell into one of two categories either manic or melancholy. They were treated with catharsis, which is the relief of strong feelings or tension, to expel crisis from the individual. The patient was submerged into ice baths until they lost consciousness or were given a massive shock to the brain. Treatment considered barbaric by present day standards.Another method of treatment was the 'Bleeding' practice, which entailed the draining of bad blood from the individual. This usually resulted in the death of the patient or the need for lifelong care, Prefrontal lobotomy was also common practice. I am friends with a few people who used to live in our local \u2018asylum\u2018. 10 years on from the closure, their lives have much improved, and with each new generation I hope this improvement continues.Norman Kunc has made a powerful video to illustrate this least we forget.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R35vNXwwRgI/AAAAAAAABBI/YQLu4TI7f9k/s1600-h/100_American_Marine.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R35vz3wwRjI/AAAAAAAABBg/SVvEYl32CSo/s1600-h/InsaneAsylumII.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R35vNnwwRhI/AAAAAAAABBQ/YQaHDyXfYVY/s1600-h/100_Wall_Camisole.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2OxpzPybT4"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/01/least-we-forget.html", "title": "\nLeast we forget......\n"},

When the nerves in the ear get stimulated, they create a reflex in the throat that causes a muscle spasm, which cures the itch.Having trouble hearing someone at a party or on the phone? Use your right ear\u2026it's better at picking up rapid speech. But, the left is better at picking up music tones. If you need to relieve yourself BADLY but you're not anywhere near a bathroom, fantasize about RELATIONS. That preoccupies your brain and distracts it.Next time the doctor's going to give you an injection, COUGH as the needle is going in. The cough raises the level of pressure in your spinal canal, which limits the pain sensation as it tries to travel to your brain.Clear a stuffed nose or relieve sinus pressure by pushing your tongue against the roof of your mouth\u2026then pressing a finger between your eyebrows. Repeat that for 20 seconds\u2026it causes the vomer bone to rock, which loosens your congestion and clears you up.You can stop a toothache by rubbing ice on the back of your hand, on the webbed area between your thumb and index finger. The nerve pathways there stimulate a part of the brain that blocks pain signals from your mouth.If you drink to much and the room starts spinning, put your hand on something stable. The reason: Alcohol dilutes the blood in the part of your ear called the cupula, which regulates balance. Putting your hand on something stable gives your brain another reference point\u2026which will help make the world stop spinning.Stop a nose bleed by putting some cotton on your upper gums\u2026right behind the small dent below your nose\u2026and press against it hard. Most of the bleeding comes from the cartilage wall that divides the nose, so pressing there helps get it to stop.Nervous? Slow your heart rate down by blowing on your thumb. The vagus nerve controls your heart rate, and you can calm it down by breathing. Finally, this one's totally USELESS, but a nice trick. Have someone stick their arm out to the side, straight, palm down. Press down on his wrist with two fingers. He'll resist, and his arm will stay horizontal. Then, have him put his foot on a surface that's half an inch off the ground, like a stack of magazines, and do the trick again. Because his spine position is thrown off, his arm will fall right to his side, no matter how much he tries to resistSome more fun tricks for the kids to try.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R3_r8nwwRpI/AAAAAAAABCQ/LI4STm0LB9o/s1600-h/JWYCAUMQAL5CAS9P97OCA35EKBKCA55VKVSCAKT0X7RCAOS912FCAUY2EOTCANE8C75CA87YJYGCALR1HM4CAEFB1XGCAGP6CLECAP8O2O6CADR0DOUCA8Y3SODCAKYFAQWCA00MFWJCAX4TVZTCAZNFELQ.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R3_r8nwwRqI/AAAAAAAABCY/uVuDEXKMG34/s1600-h/P8RCAE0JQAPCA73BYXOCAPQQMV0CAOYSQ7ECASPHWYNCARU6HSVCAV2FTSTCAFO0M2SCAF925PFCAES1WAMCA5HVKP5CAFZUYUVCA8USRM3CA6ZDQ2KCA2S9LN2CA6XW28SCAU4FSWGCAVRHQUNCAKM4LJ2.jpg", "http://www.kidzworld.com/article/1917-body-and-mind-experiments"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/01/mind-and-body-tricks.html", "title": "\nMind and body tricks\n"},

However, a third of adults in Britain regularly sleep 5 hours or less and between 30 and 40 percent report sleep disorders. The lack of sleep is blamed on problems with mental health, weight gain and high blood pressure to name but a few.More people are having children later in life and with global working hours demanding more of our time, a night of uninterrupted sleep has become more of a luxury.Sleep deprivation takes both a physical and financial toll.

Things to look for;Positioning of body relative to other people and thingsShape of whole bodyMovement of limbs, head and fingersMicro-movement of musclesSkin colour and textureVoice pitchTexture of voice toneSpeed of speakingSweatingBodily smells (eg. pheromones)Personality and status are also given away by;Dress, including style, tidiness, coordination.Personal adornments, from jewellery to watches and badges.Office and desk space at work, including size and type of computer, chair, etc.Items owned, from cameras to cars to houses.Here are some things for you to think about.Its also used a lot when playing games like Poker. Most of us read all these cues without even realising. Many autistic people find this difficult. So they appear to respond inappropriately to others' emotions.

{"date": "Monday, 14 January 2008", "body": "\nNose blowing.Jen mentioned nose blowing and I have see this around a few blog as for many autistic children this is a tricky art to learn.If you don\u2019t have an autistic child you may want to skip the next paragraph and see if you have the correct nasal etiquette below.  C at the tender age of 19 has not mastered it. Over the years he has done all manner of things like using me as a tissue, not to mention his clothes the furniture etc. Nose picking he has down to a fine art. But blowing still eludes him. (He also cant blow out of his mouth. Which apparently is the first step to blowing throw ones nose!) He has recently found if he shakes his head vigorously that\u2026.well I will let you visualise that one.Apparently Most children are developmentally able to learn to blow their noses by around age 2 \u2014 some even earlier. Of course, whether or not your child is interested at that point is another matter.As I don\u2019t have any autistic nose blowing advice I thought I would hand this one over to you\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.For the rest of you out there did you know about;Nasal Etiquette - A short guide to nose manners.You should keep your nose clear of debris at all times. It is terribly impolite to wander around sniffing all the time. Worse, if your sinuses become blocked, you will be unable to breathe while eating or kissing and may embarrass yourself and any others that may be with you. Blockage can also cause sinusitis, commonly known as a sinus infection.When blowing your nose--in order to remain polite--please make certain that you use a tissue handkerchief, or bandanna. Blow gently into the tissue while holding one nostril closed, or while alternating nostrils. Do not hold one nostril closed with a finger and blow out into space until your sinus is clear. This is called harking and is considered in terrible taste. It is very rude to leave things from your nose for others to step on. Also, inserting your finger into a nostril at any time is considered rude. For those of you who think you are alone when driving in traffic and feel that would be a good time to go for a dig: We can see you! You know who you areProper use of the tissue is important. Fold your tissue carefully after blowing your nose, be sure to wipe away any mucous that may have collected around your nostrils. Also, be certain to look in the mirror after doing this. Nothing is more repellent than seeing someone return from the bathroom with a glistening green friend freshly planted on their upper lip, stuck in a moustache or beard, or worse yet, dangling from an errant nose hair. Remove all traces of your activity before appearing before people.There are some people who constantly scratch or rub at the base of their nose to dislodge dried nose particles. They think they are clever and look like they are scratching an itch and that others are oblivious to their semi passive nose picking. To those of you who do this: We know what you are doing! Do you think we're totally ignorant?Nose appearanceNose hairs are, in all cases, unsightly blemishes on an otherwise pleasant nose. You should keep your hairs trimmed so as not to make others uncomfortable. A good rule of thumb is: If you can see them, so can everyone else.It is considered highly improper to use your nose as a spoon rack. Some people enjoy sticking spoons to their noses in restaurants. What they do not typically know is that there are roving bands of spoon thieves in various parts of the world, and if one happens to steal the spoon your nose is attached to you will spend the remainder of your life with two hideous holes in the front of your face. If you wish to continue to have a nose with which to be polite, please ceases this activity before it's too late!Important: If you have a large nose, please do not get it pierced. This will only accentuate the size of your nose and make you look clownish. If this still does not deter you, be certain to get lots of other facial piercing and tattoos in order to offset your enormous nose.Miscellaneous Using your nose to hum is quite acceptable, in most circumstances. It is generally considered impolite, however, to hum while you have a cold. You might drip and soil your clothing.Breathing through your nose is always considered polite. Breathing through your mouth all the time makes you look oafish and leaves you open to drooling. Drool is, unfortunately, outside the scope of this node.In general use your best judgement. If you are doing something with your nose that would offend you if you saw someone else doing it, you should probably alter your behaviour.So now you knows!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://chaosandjoy.blogspot.com/", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R4ioQXwwRzI/AAAAAAAABDg/bYoin4KAZ6o/s1600-h/nose.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R4io4XwwR1I/AAAAAAAABDw/5rsEUSCGOgY/s1600-h/S4NCAKCM2OFCATAW4CRCASJMBMHCA3TRCZPCAN9Q71YCAH2DP6ICAT3IUEECA55RD7FCAR78S3TCA6VV48XCAFJ2ZJGCA8VV1ILCA9NF961CAO60SJHCAR3PLB8CAH5TU08CA8XC43VCAU5MHQ7CA6S5769.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R4ioQnwwR0I/AAAAAAAABDo/mmGoMYUjqn4/s1600-h/nose2.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/01/art-of-nose-blowing.html", "title": "\nThe art of nose blowing!\n"},

To the Romans, the Moon was the goddess Luna. The Greeks referred to the Moon goddess as Selene, and the Egyptians worshiped the Moon as Isis.Over the course of a month, the Moon appears to grow ('wax') and shrink ('wane').In fact, ever since prehistoric times, the phases of the Moon have been used a basis for calendars and time measurement. This is how we get the length of our month \u2013 the time that passes from one full Moon to the next.There's something about a full moon that conjures up spooky images of werewolves, insane axe-wielding murderers and other odd and unexplainable behaviours. Everything from horror films to Halloween cards has capitalized on this phenomenon, making it almost commonplace in our minds. But does the moon really affect human behaviour, or does this notion only exist in our imaginations?Psychiatrist Arnold Lieber, theorized that since humans are composed mostly of water (like the earth), our bodies might have \"biological tides\" that influence our emotions.Many hospital workers seem to notice that when the moon is full, there are more admissions for everything from births to violent crimes.But, when put to the test, no link was found between births and the lunar cycle.The studies are not consistent. For every positive study, there is a negative study.Indeed, it does appear that many studies contradict each other. An English study, for instance, found that your odds of being bitten by an animal were twice as high on full-moon nights. Another similar study, in Australia, found no relationship whatsoever between dog bites and the full moon.Is it possible that we, as a culture, like the idea of a mysterious moon-related power, and are pushing the myth forward because we want to \"When something unusual happens and there is a full moon, people might notice the moon and assign blame\u201dAnother explanation, lies in media coverage.\"Journalists pay too much attention to finding sensational news or news that will support interesting resultsThere is good reason to believe that people's personalities do change around the time of the full moon, not because of any astronomical force, but because it creates the optimum lighting conditions for feeling carefree and mischievous.\"What do you think?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R4n7hHwwSQI/AAAAAAAABHA/LDwI-Vy3sIs/s1600-h/VE7CAMSX0FOCAYP9W45CACBQOPLCA82CKUJCADLBP52CA82JU0DCA5E6F5WCAG4WJHVCANLFKWSCA51X0VXCAHYIL7WCAAMDL9BCATLH1SFCAYKDMO5CACK0UJOCAERGZPFCA3RLHCDCAD7UXY0CA6E63KR.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R4n7hHwwSPI/AAAAAAAABG4/LEFNrpdBmUw/s1600-h/AndreyTTL061100014.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R4n7g3wwSOI/AAAAAAAABGw/sJ9TJXUpx9o/s1600-h/moonwolf.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/01/only-moon-howls.html", "title": "\nOnly the moon howls\n"},

LovecraftA phobia is an intense fear of a situation or an object. It severely restricts your life, and may force you to take extreme measures to avoid whatever triggers it. A phobia is known as an anxiety disorder (like obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic attacks), which means it centres on our natural reaction to fear. Anxiety is about fear, and we all get anxious at some time. It's a natural reaction in all of us, and keeps us safe.People can develop a phobia about any object, whether animate or inanimate, and about any situation. They can be roughly divided into different types: specific phobias (about any animal, flying or germs); specific situations ( the dark, heights, enclosed spaces, being alone or falling); social phobia (about meeting, speaking to or eating in front of other people), and illness (about heart trouble, cancer or losing a limb). Most people with phobias suffer from one or other of those mentioned. Agoraphobia (a fear of being away from home) is probably the most common phobia, and particularly affects women.People with phobias try to avoid what they are afraid of. If they cannot, they may experiencePanic and fearRapid heartbeatShortness of breathTremblingA strong desire to get away Some unusual examples;Arachibutyrophobia- Fear of peanut butter sticking to the roof of the mouth.Barophobia- Fear of gravity.Chronophobia- Fear of time.Consecotaleophobia- Fear of chopsticksDidaskaleinophobia- Fear of going to school.Euphobia- Fear of hearing good news.Geliophobia- Fear of laughterLogizomechanophobia- Fear of computers.Pentheraphobia- Fear of mother-in-law.Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia- Fear of long words!!Thaasophobia- Fear of sitting.Venustraphobia- Fear of beautiful women.Some people can trace their phobia back to their childhood and to a certain frightening event, which may have caused a panic attack at the time. But it's not always so clear to someone where their phobia comes from.There are almost as many phobias as there are things and situations.

By now im sure I have could have gained degrees in Psychology, Psychiatry, Law, Nutrition, Anatomy to name but a few oh and of course autism.Knowledge is power. (As its usually the professionals that give me the most stress!)2. A good friend is essential to let of steam to.An understanding friend is better than a therapist; and cheaper too!3. Look in to alternative therapies not only for your child but yourself as well.I.e. I looked into colour therapy not only for Cs bedroom but for mine to so I have a relaxing safe haven to escape to. Aromatherapy doesn\u2019t seem to calm C, but it sure helps me!4. Remember some things do get better.You will become more expert in cleaning up food, poo etc without batting an eye lid. You will let more stares and comments from the public go over your head. And you will become more adept in to managing and avoiding melt downs. Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference. ~Winston Churchill5.

Pica is fairly common in people with developmental disabilities. (C in his time has eaten many unusual things) It can also occur during pregnancy.In some cases, pica is related not to dietary deficiencies but to folk traditions passed on in families or ethnic groups.Some people treat clay or dirt eating as a part of daily routine, somewhat like smoking.Others believe that eating dirt will help them incorporate magical spirits from the Earth into their bodies.There are other strange eating habits; (Hope you have eaten before you read this!!)Xylophagia is a condition involving the consumption of wood.Trichophagia is the compulsive eating of hair.The hair eventually collects in the gastrointestinal tract causing symptoms such as indigestion and stomach pain.Hyalophagia is the eating of glass.Urophagia is the consumption of urine.Geophagy is a practice of eating earthy substances such as clay, and chalk. Cannibalism Self-cannibalism among humans. A certain amount of self-cannibalism occurs unwittingly, as the body consumes dead cells from the tongue and cheeks.Some people drink their own blood, a practice called autovampirism.Coprophagia is the practice of the consumption of feces.Necrophagia is the act of a human eating dead human flesh. Some unusual food facts; The first soup was made of hippopotamus. The largest food item on a menu is roast camel. The camel is stuffed with a sheep\u2019s carcass, which is stuffed with chickens, which are stuffed with fish, which are stuffed with eggs. This feast is sometimes featured in Bedouin weddings.Dynamite can be made with peanuts.Coconut water can be used (in emergencies) as a substitute for blood plasma. Bee Larvae is eaten in China and Japan (where it is called hachinoko).Spiders from Skuon in Cambodia are similar to North American Tarantulas. They are bred in holes in the ground especially for eating and are deep fried.Whats the strangest thing you have eaten? \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kidshealth.org/parent/nutrition_fit/nutrition/pica.html", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6gcwCiU4GI/AAAAAAAABXQ/uqUNifIm4HA/s1600-h/urine_big.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylophagia", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichophagia", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyalophagia", "http://www.heartlandhealing.com/pages/archive/urine_therapy/index.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophagy", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophagy", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6NsriiU3TI/AAAAAAAABQ0/RLQDy4gqjVc/s1600-h/cannible.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-cannibalism", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprophagia", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6NscSiU3RI/AAAAAAAABQk/0V0-dxcmMb0/s1600-h/76GCASDPGO0CAL6EYZJCAF4NMNSCAFMH7UVCAML6N6MCAU09XJVCA48DUNLCAPBZMMRCAF8Z5UECAPMPWH0CAB76083CA6HJVJ0CACMJINUCADCS79DCAT9R63WCAFKLYLOCA4IH9FMCA75RNM3CAZZK5J0.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/02/hungry.html", "title": "\nHungry?\n"},

A Walnut looks like a little brain, a left and right hemisphere, upper cerebrums and lower cerebellums. Even the wrinkles or folds are on the nut just like the neo-cortex. We now know that walnuts help develop over 3 dozen neuro-transmitters for brain function.Grapes hang in a cluster that has the shape of the heart. Each grape looks like a blood cell and all of the research today shows that grapes are also profound heart and blood vitalizing food.   Celery, Bok Choy, Rhubarb and more look just like bones. These foods specifically target bone strength. Bones are 23% sodium and these foods are 23% sodium. If you don\u2019t have enough sodium in your diet the body pulls it from the bones, making them weak. These foods replenish the skeletal needs of the body..Bananas, Cucumber, Zucchini and more target the size and strength of the male sexual organ.     A Tomato has four chambers and is red. The heart is red and has four chambers. All of the research shows tomatoes are indeed pure heart and blood food.     A sliced Carrot looks like the human eye. The pupil, iris and radiating lines look just like the human eye\u2026and YES science now shows that carrots greatly enhance blood flow to and function of the eyes.   Figs are full of seeds and hang in twos when they grow. Figs increase the motility of male sperm and increase the numbers of sperm as well to overcome male sterility.  Kidney Beans actually heal and help maintain kidney function and yes, they look exactly like the human kidneys    Olives assist the health and function of the ovaries Egg Plant, Avocadoes and Pears target the health and function of the womb and cervix of the female - they look just like these organs. Today\u2019s research shows that when a woman eats 1 avocado a week, it balances hormones, sheds unwanted birth weight and prevents cervical cancers. And how profound is this? \u2026. it takes exactly 9 months to grow an Avocado from blossom to ripened fruit.  Onions look like body cells. Today\u2019s research shows that onions help clear waste materials from all of the body cells. They even produce tears which wash the epithelial layers of the eyes    Sweet Potatoes look like the pancreas and actually balance the glycemic index of diabetics.   Grapefruits, Oranges, and other Citrus fruits look just like the mammary glands of the female and actually assist the health of the breasts and the movement of lymph in and out of the breasts. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6c_QyiU4DI/AAAAAAAABW4/hzR6KHLJmMc/s1600-h/34765396ed8.png", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6c-6SiU4BI/AAAAAAAABWo/3sziXex8Mm0/s1600-h/41335659pu2.png", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6c-6iiU4CI/AAAAAAAABWw/t5BXAskHuks/s1600-h/19138979xg6.png", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6dALiiU4EI/AAAAAAAABXA/bM3QVwm8kTI/s1600-h/ban.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6c-xCiU3_I/AAAAAAAABWY/hOd0K_i33CE/s1600-h/55337426hc3.png", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6c-xSiU4AI/AAAAAAAABWg/wUbljHFBB6A/s1600-h/38757397ou5.png", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6c-jiiU39I/AAAAAAAABWI/qbSajdIhANQ/s1600-h/70182187nl1.png", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6c-mSiU3-I/AAAAAAAABWQ/7WKJmKb4ODI/s1600-h/57602361jv4.png", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6c-PyiU37I/AAAAAAAABV0/DqIn1TW4ROM/s1600-h/74572656dg9.png", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6c-UyiU38I/AAAAAAAABWA/iIDaeQJqOcQ/s1600-h/74439169wk6.png", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6c-HSiU35I/AAAAAAAABVk/xtSPZci9sT8/s1600-h/79645772ef1.png", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6c-HiiU36I/AAAAAAAABVs/8GEauUsB5qw/s1600-h/83906047yy5.png", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6dDISiU4FI/AAAAAAAABXI/aw_DkEwtO0s/s1600-h/pair.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/02/food-shapes.html", "title": "\nFood shapes\n"},

A friend of mine told me about this, and it does seem to help a bit. But the bottle is rather heavy!Today I am meeting C and his staff at the hospital for another helmet fitting with the orthotist. From their measurements from last time (cant quite see how they got any!) a prototype will have been made, if it fits, it then goes back and be covered in leather.C doesn\u2019t like his head being touched. Hair washing, hair cutting etc is not an easy task. Its taken years to get C used to having things on his head. We started with a ski band, then a woolly hat, and on to a baseball cap. All of which he takes off when he bangs his head (which is very often). And recently we have been trying with a rugby helmet bought off the peg - he is not happy with it. It doesn\u2019t fit very well, and covers his ears, as you know he likes his fingers in his ears all the time, so its getting covered in food (and other things) . Since wearing this (when you can get it on) he has been hitting himself more on his chest and back, Which are now permanently bruised. But for me at least his head is having some rest, and hopefully able to heal a bit as its not looking good.Hopefully this new helmet as it is custom made for him will be more comfortable and he will have easy access to his ears. So another traumatic hospital visit, but this time I am bringing C home early for half term. Last time I had to leave him and he so obviously wanted to come with me. :(Well had better go and catch my train, and must remember to take the cork out of my mouth!Oh have you seen Clear Blue Water by Karen Montague-Reyes, which sometimes features a young autistic boy who headbangs!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rd.com/health/prevention/anti-aging/how-to-remain-youthful-looking-and-feeling-as-you-age/P3/article.html", "http://www.mshealthcareers.com/careers/orthotist_prosthetist.htm", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R6ym1SiU4sI/AAAAAAAABcA/UEBNiZNVOrk/s1600-h/OTCCABL3HJPCAO2YNWXCA0E7O90CABWMP07CAUHJMHOCA4OCPP6CAFNRLMUCA79YO0XCALV3K15CAY0PB3RCA4OQ1SOCAMROT5DCAUJ5BRXCA0J5H6OCAAK2VFTCA8XZK9OCAP3HIN6CALHOIF4CAFLUB6K.jpg", "http://www.gocomics.com/clearbluewater/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/02/helmet-fitting-stage-2.html", "title": "\nHelmet fitting - stage 2\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, 17 February 2008", "body": "\nKaren Montague-Reyes writes a comic strip Clear Blue Water about family life with Seth a young autistic boy who headbangs. Ive been following it for a few weeks now (ive had a few reservations but as i know its only a comic Ive let them go). But yesterday I was saddened to read the above strip so i wrote to Karen.Dear KarenI have a 19 year old non verbal autistic son who head bangs, so I was delighted when I was told of your comic strip as I thought what a great way to raise the profile of autism.So I was very sad to read in today\u2019s strip that in a perfect world Seth would be fine.Autism is fine! My son is fine, I love every autistic inch of him. And im sure autistic people themselves who read this would be very upset.Its the unaccepting world that isn\u2019t fine.I and many other parents work very hard to try and raise awareness in a positive way. Couldn\u2019t you use your gift as a comic strip writer to help people to see that the many autistic kids and adults are wonderful and loved for who they are?Thank youAnd this was Karen's prompt reply;You make a good point.  I certainly didn't mean to make anyone with autism feel badly about themselves.  I have a 12 year old severely autistic son, and I have a different perspective than yours.  I love him with all my heart, but if I could take his autism away tomorrow I would do it.  My son is not fine the way he is.  His quality of life is very low, so in my perfect world, my son would be healed of autism.  I realize this is never going to happen, and we love and accept him as he is right now, but this doesn't change my feelings.There is a split in the autism community about this, as you must know.  Some folks agree more with you, and some more with me.  However, I can only write my comic strip from my own point of view, which is, of course, what I did here.I am not saying all autism spectrum disorders are bad.  I have a few family members with Aspergers and they are not disabled, in fact they seem to have many wonderful gifts.  I also know a few high functioning autistic people and I feel about them the same way.  It's not a bad way to be, it's just a different way to be.  Perfectly fine.  But low-functioning autism is terrible, not to put too fine of a point on it.I'm all for raising awareness in a positive way though, and I can certainly get behind that.  In fact, that is my entire point for putting autism in my strip in the first place.  I think we'll have to agree to disagree about this issue.  Your son sounds very lucky to have such a loving mother. Take care. KarenWhilst surfing for Karen\u2019s email I also came across this discussion about the strip.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R7gBbL_r-TI/AAAAAAAABgA/Km1v9OddZm4/s1600-h/cbw080216.gif", "http://www.aspiesforfreedom.com/archive/index.php/thread-417.html"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/02/clear-blue-water.html", "title": "\nClear Blue Water\n"},

Both natural and artificial light may trigger seizures. Many people think that everybody with epilepsy is photosensitive, but in fact only five in every hundred people with epilepsy are.SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) is a type of winter depression that affects an estimated half a million people every winter.It is caused by a biochemical imbalance in the hypothalamus due to the shortening of daylight hours and the lack of sunlight in winter.For many people SAD is a serious illness. Migraine sufferers may experience hypersensitivity to light and sound. Light sensory overload in autism is well documentedThree possible effects \u2022 Direct hypersensitivity to light\u2022 Over-stimulation from interplay of light in space\u2022 Effect of changes in lit environment on contextual understanding & memory C is certainly affected by light. He loves watching reflected light on surfaces, he can get totally absorbed in them. Some places he cant go in as the light really upsets him, usually the Fluorescent sort.Am meeting C at hospital today as they are going to make a custom made helmet for him for his headbanging.

But we see ourselves as a vital and proud community, with values of our own that enhance our quality of life, values that could enhance life for all:Tolerance for others' differences (racial, intellectual, financial/class)Matter-of-fact orientation toward helping; acceptance of human interdependence over rugged individualism.High tolerance for lack of resolution, living with unknowns or less-than-ideal outcomes.Characteristic dark humour, laughing at the oppressor, finding humour in almost any aspect of lifeHighly developed skills at managing multiple problems, systems, and helpers.Creativity, lack of rigidity, ability to use traditional elements in new ways to solve problemsSophisticated future orientation; planning around anticipated obstacles.Ability to read others' attitudes; skill at filling in the gaps and sorting out contradictory messages.Convinced that through their honest hearts and open minds children can help us to reconnect with our own innocence... cultivate patience and gratitude... live more spontaneously... rediscover the pleasures of play... be profoundly present in our relationships... and, ultimately, become better parents and happier people.\u201cWhile we try to teach our children all about life, our children teach us what life is all about.\u201dWhat have you learnt?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R7x5mL_r-tI/AAAAAAAABjM/IySiz-LiFQc/s1600-h/beautiful+child+portrate.jpg", "http://jimspoliticalthoughts.blogspot.com/", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R7x5xr_r-uI/AAAAAAAABjU/FsETU_sF4nI/s1600-h/unconditional+love.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/02/our-children-teach-us.html", "title": "\nOur children teach us\n"},
{"date": "Monday, 25 February 2008", "body": "\nC and I have some enormous changes happening this year, and the thought of these changes have been worrying me and getting me down.At the age of 14 in this country we start talking about transition plans for when your child leaves school. C leaves school some time this year, and there are no transition plans in place.  Over a year ago I found somewhere for C, I didn\u2019t want him vegetating in an out of date day centre or segregated through independent living, these seem to be the 2 main choices. So it took me a couple of years to find somewhere that i felt C would be happy in and continue to grow.Because they haven\u2019t dotted the I\u2019s and crossed the T's (re the funding) time is slipping by. C finds change incredibly difficult, (When he moved up from Junior to senior school, it took over a year of the most horrendous head banging, till he settled, he is now 2 foot taller and much stronger) and a change this big for him scares me, especially when we could have been using this time to prepare him.If i am honest I am afraid, I fear for C's safety, of the unknown, the change, etc and it has been doing my head in, not to put it too bluntly!!C is ready to leave school, he is ready to leave the class room behind and stop being taught how to count to one, he is ready to experience a more adult environment. And I'm sure he will flourish when he has become used to it. It\u2019s the getting used to it bit that I worry for him.And then I read this, which when I thought about it made some sense to me. So I wanted to share these thoughts with you, and try and reinforce them for myself. Its about fear being an illusion. False Expectations Appearing Real - its all in our imaginations. Which of course it is, as it hasnt happened yet. As we become more absorbed in fear we strengthen the existence of the very thing that we fear.So I am trying to think positive!It may all go smoothly! Sorry - it will all go smoothly.Would love to hear what you do to distract yourself from worrying about things.On a completely different note, I was cheered up no end this morning when I opened an email and was met with these words \u2018We spotted this cow and thought of you\u2019!

{"date": "Thursday, 28 February 2008", "body": "\nSome of humankind\u2019s most creative brains have kept themselves busy creating answers for needs that didn\u2019t exist and solutions that are more cumbersome than the problems they promised to tackle. Here are a few of the inventions that didnt make it.1. Device for waking persons from sleep Patent no 256265, issued 1882Sometimes, an alarm clock just isn\u2019t quite enough for rousing heavy sleepers to face the day. So why not hang an array of weights on a frame above the snoozer\u2019s head and, with the help of clockwork machinery, drop them upon their head until they wake? \u201cWhen they fall it will strike a light blow, sufficient to awaken the sleeper, but not heavy enough to cause pain,\u201d assures the2. Cat duster3. Water-filled brassiere Patent no US4734078, issued 1988Wonder bra meets Waterworld. The American Inventor, James Moreau, explains it best (if it can be explained): \u201cA brassiere which surrounds the breasts with water, so that a buoyant force provides improved and independent support for each breast. A transparent version is suggested for those who wish to make a fashion statement.\u201d 4. Sleeve nose wiper 5. Sound-muffler for covering the mouthPatent no 4834212, issued 1989It\u2019s the invention that really makes you want to scream \u2013 but no one will hear you. Moira and Frank Figone a couple from Belmont, California, created this face-tube device to enable purchasers to \u201cYell or scream without disturbing others, allowing them to vent built-up anger and frustration.\u201d In this fiendishly basic design, the interior of the flat-bottomed muffler tube is coated with sound-absorbing foam. But here\u2019s the clever bit: a microphone can be included to pick up a some sound and activate a light display or meter, \u201cgiving the user immediate visual feedback as to the intensity of sound produced6. Speaks for its self. 7. Alarm-equipped forkUS patent 5,421,089, issued 1995Are you a manic masticator or a super fast food shoveller? The cutlery creators Nicole Dubus and Springfield Susan have come up with the just answer for you: a fork with a built in timer and alarm. The timer\u2019s circuitry is connected to the handle of the fork and buzzes or lights up after a preset time, ensuring that eaters leave sufficient space between forkfuls for chewing 32 healthy times before swallowing. A must for business lunches and candlelit dinners. 8. Finger tooth brush 9. The trouser-cushionUK patent application No GB2267208, 1993British inventor Michael Bayley decided to put an end to standing nightmares by creating portable seat that you wear on a waist-belt. OK, it\u2019s a somewhat convoluted version of having a cushion with a loop that goes through your belt. \u201cThe seat cushion is pivotable between a stowed position and a seating position in which it hangs down so that you can sit on it,\u201d says the patent application. 10. Butter stick 11. Over the years there have also been many inventions of the cause of autism, old and new.If you liked these you can see the winners of Britain\u2019s Landfill Prize for the most pointless, over complicated and wasteful consumer objects from the past 12 months.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R7nhCr_r-mI/AAAAAAAABiY/lhSnusRiKk4/s1600-h/nose+wipe.gif", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R7nhC7_r-nI/AAAAAAAABig/_4fUpss2eUo/s1600-h/Prevent+hair.bmp", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R7ngur_r-jI/AAAAAAAABiA/MgLxAjI0Qws/s1600-h/butter+stick.jpg", "http://www.autismvox.com/the-refrigerator-mother-and-the-puppets/", "http://www.autismvox.com/toxic-mom/", "http://www.enoughness.co.uk/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/02/bright-ideas.html", "title": "\nBright ideas!\n"},

I try and make a point of taking C to see a show every time he is home. I have to choose carefully. Yesterdays choice went down really well!We went to see Afrika! Afrika! at the O2 Arena. I am not a circus fan, but this show blew my mind! It was adrenalin-pumping! The music was wonderful, and vibrated through the seats, the whole show was very visual which C watched out of the corner of his eye (peripheral vision) he even took his fingers out of his ears! The show kept Cs interest the whole way through which is a first!This lady on the left made a few people feel sick and they had to run out! You had to see it to believe it!It was too dark to take any photos in the arena, so i took one of C on the way home - escalator watching.With all this over stimulation C used to find it too much and would of had a melt down by now. But these days he has found ways to calm himself, when we got home he sat on the loo in the dark for an hour and a half. (I have learnt not to take him to a loo at a show!)Today I take C back to school, stopping off at the hospital on the way for a 3rd and hopefully final helmet fitting. Unfortunately he hasn't found a way of coping with things like this yet.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp2.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R8Kjn7_r_PI/AAAAAAAABnc/C4CGG88GDOs/s1600-h/afrika.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R8Kjjb_r_OI/AAAAAAAABnU/LeE4bGAlQTc/s1600-h/022.jpg", "http://www.afrika.pte-ag.eu/", "http://www.theo2.co.uk/", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R8Kg2L_r_KI/AAAAAAAABm0/-y_C7EvFVDE/s1600-h/bs.jpg", "http://blog.donnawilliams.net/2007/03/05/peripheral-vision-in-some-people-on-the-autism-spectrum/", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R8KhSL_r_LI/AAAAAAAABm8/uFc5L8svWp8/s1600-h/Image005+(2).jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/02/afrika-afrika.html", "title": "\nAfrika!

{"date": "Monday, 3 March 2008", "body": "\nAn alternative view from a Care Professional working with Children with Disabilities.By InthemudCasdok asked me if I would write a short piece about what it\u2019s like on the other side of the fence.A Social Worker\u2019s point of view.Firstly, can I just say that I came into Social Work with the aim to be able to support and care for people in need and I wanted to make a difference. Assist people to reach their full potential and support families with the best levels of care possible. I believed I could make a difference, how quickly my hopes were dashed, how quickly I was trod into the ground by petty bureaucracy and lack of funds and lack of resources. Every small piece of resource had to be begged for and eeked out to support many families, so instead of being able to offer respite every weekend, you\u2019d be lucky to get one night a month.I digress, Casdok has allowed me to use her situation of an example of Social Care support and I do feel well placed to talk about it because I was Casdok and C\u2019s social worker for over 12 years. That may surprise some of you, because most of the time all you hear about is social workers coming and going, only staying in teams for 1-2 years before moving on. That is not how I work, I\u2019ve been a \u201cstayer\u201d, even though my title changed, the department changed around me but I stayed with my families through thick and thin.I joined this team in 1994, having worked for another team elsewhere in the county for the previous 10 years.Casdok came with a Government Health Warning. The mere mention of her name had social workers and managers quaking in their boots and fleeing for the hills.Casdok and her previous social worker had not seen eye to eye, and management had had to take over waiting for a new social worker to take on this daunting role.Then I joined the team, innocent of past history but was soon briefed as to the notoriety of the case and the ominous task of taking over.You see Casdok knew what she wanted for C and wasn\u2019t prepared to rest until she got it, this always causes major problems for a strapped for cash Social Services team.I must admit I was dreading my initial contact with Casdok and had many sleepless nights leading up to it. But when the day arrived, I met with Casdok and C for the first time and I was shocked by the enormity of his disability and what Casdok had to go through each day. I was totally in awe of Casdok\u2019s determination to get the right school for her son. I vowed there and then that I would do my level best to help her achieve her goals for C.Not everything was plain sailing, I had a huge fight on my hands to get Senior Management to agree the necessary and appropriate care packages.There would be weeks and weeks of utter frustration and desperation during which time I would be writing reports, presenting to resource panels and attending meetings, only to be turned down and told to do something else, find a more economic resource, then rewrite reports and go back to panels. But I was resourceful and tried to be as creative as possible within a confined situation as I was determined to fight for Casdok because I believed she deserved the best I could get for her and for C.It was an uphill struggle, no sooner would we get one part of the care sorted then another problem would arise and we\u2019d have to start all over again.Casdok got the school she wanted for C, but the holiday respite wasn\u2019t working and it was so difficult to get it right. C\u2019s autism meant he really found change intolerable and to come home from termly boarding and then have to go to respite just tipped him over the top and his behaviour would escalate to such levels that no one knew how to cope with him. So we had to think again.I organised home based respite for him, and whilst this was partly ok, it wasn\u2019t ideal as the nurses varied from visit to visit and C got very confused and distressed, causing even more problems for Casdok when they left.Then came the Godsend, the Government introduced Direct payments. I was a huge advocate for this, I\u2019d already been attempting to offer flexible respite to families, i.e. giving them funding to sort out their own care but it had only been on a limited basis. This new step forward meant that Casdok could choose who she wanted to support her and C at home.So I lead the way and set up the first Direct payment for Children in our County and Casdok at last got the support for C that she needed, it only took 8 years!!Casdok and I shared many difficult times over the years- but I believe Casdok trusted me to do my best and whilst I couldn\u2019t always get what she needed straight away I usually got there in the end. I learnt to play the system. But it frustrated me enormously that families like Casdok and C have to jump through so many hoops to get what they should have by right, appropriate education, social life and access to good health care. Having a child with Autism is struggle enough without having to battle constantly for every small amount of support. Yet the only way a family seems to get enough respite or the appropriate schooling is to fight and fight hard.I\u2019ve known Casdok for 14 years and I still don\u2019t know how she does it, where she get her energy to keep going, but she does it, because she loves her son. And I have the greatest respect for her, I hold her in high esteem for all she has done for C and for other people with autism.Working with families like Casdok and C is exhausting, but there is a sense of achievement when you\u2019ve fought the battles and at last got the right resources in place.I do not usually stay in contact with clients, but Casdok has become so much more than a client and now I no longer work for that organisation we have become good friends.Don\u2019t be too hard on your social worker, she has a job to do within the tight restraints that councils operate, but if you look for the human being within you\u2019ll find a caring, wonderful person who just wants to help you\u2026\u2026\u2026..Well, that\u2019s how I felt!Thank you Inthemud for writing this, and for supporting C and I for all those years. We certainly went through a lot together. I really don't know where we would be now with out your determination and heart.You did make a difference. x\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://inthemud-lifeinthemud.blogspot.com/", "http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Children+with+disabilities?opendocument", "http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/DisabledPeople/FinancialSupport/DG_10016128", "http://inthemud-lifeinthemud.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/03/guest-post-from-other-side.html", "title": "\nGuest Post - From the other side.\n"},

Experts think a combination of fatigue, hormonal changes and stress can all contribute to a loss of memory.Forgetfulness is also a part of women's defence mechanism after the pain and rigours of childbirth.Apparently it is a short-term problem, which lasts only for a few months.  As we know there are exceptions to every rule, as 19 years on - I still have it!

I was referred here by someone, and I'm glad I was. What an interesting discussion. This is the first discussion I've come across about this that has stayed civilized and that's both remarkable and refreshing.Perhaps I wasn't clear in my response, but we do love and accept our son without question just the way he is. We appreciate his quirks, and find joy in his enthusiasm. If I could go back and choose to either have him or not, I'd choose to have him. But I would do things differently. I wouldn't vaccinate him. I would fight for early intervention therapies that I just didn't know about when he was small (we weren't on the internet, and no doctors mentioned them to us.) I would do these things so that he might be higher functioning. I would do these things to give him a better quality of life.Perhaps I misspoke when I said he wasn't fine and had no quality of life. He is happy. He is loved. I don't want to get into specifics about my son's behavior, and without doing that it's very hard to explain what I mean. Let's just say that he will never experience living on his own. He will never have a job or have friends. He will never fall in love and get married. He will never have children. He will never understand where we went when my husband and I finally die. He will never know or care that he can't do any of those things, but I want them for him. I want them enough for both of us.One thing this discussion has brought home to me is that I have a huge repsonsability with my comic strip. These recent strips were written over the Christmas holidays. My son had an extremely horrible Christmas break, and so did the rest of the family. I wrote these out of sadness and desperation. No they weren't supposed to be funny, I just wanted to show other families that they are not alone with their destructive, often difficult children. However, I have realized that the point I want to get across in my strip is one more of hope, than desperation, so I have pulled a strip from running and I am going to spend this week writing more positive strips about autism and about parenting Seth. They will not run until April, but I wanted to let you know that what you have written has resonated with me.I have emailed Karen to thank her for taking on board all of your comments.Respect to Karen for listening to us and changing her approach to her comic strip.And thank you all for giving Karen some food for thought.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R7szgL_r-oI/AAAAAAAABio/yx3fJYuMKKw/s1600-h/85VCAXT4PEDCAKT9CQZCAE112D3CA8S03MGCAKGNT3XCASBPJ0QCATDSKV0CAH443KRCAQAXUXPCA4IZCUWCA4NCSW2CA1IEXWMCA00U63YCAJWMMWFCASRVIH7CAROQU25CA95IH3FCAVG0MAICAOEG7H1.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R7tDvb_r-rI/AAAAAAAABjA/nXV22VfVNog/s1600-h/karenr070300108.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/02/clear-blue-water-update.html", "title": "\nClear Blue Water Update\n"},

No amount of coaxing, or bribing with food will get him off until he is ready. If we are at my brothers house and his 4 children are being particularly over excited with seeing Aunty Casdok, C will hide out in the toilet, I have even given him his lunch there, as I do understand his need for peace. The longest I have left C there is an hour and a half. I certainly wouldn\u2019t leave him much longer than that.So I was intrigued when I heard this story yesterday;US authorities are trying to work out why a Kansas woman spent two years on her boyfriend's toilet - so long that by the time he called emergency services her skin had grown around the toilet seat.When the unnamed 35-year-old Ness City woman's other half finally picked up the phone on 27 February to report that \"there was something wrong with his girlfriend\", police found her \"sitting on the toilet, her sweat pants down to her mid-thigh\". She was, according to Ness County Sheriff Bryan Whipple, \"somewhat disoriented\", and apparently suffering from atrophied legs.While she initially said she \"didn't need any help, that she was OK and did not want to leave\", she was eventually convinced a trip to hospital was in order. Whipple explained: \"We pried the toilet seat off with a pry bar and the seat went with her to the hospital. The hospital removed it.\"Whipple elaborated: \"She was not glued. She was not tied. She was just physically stuck by her body. It is hard to imagine... I still have a hard time imagining it myself.\"Investigators were yesterday due to present their report to the county attorney who will decide \"whether any charges should be filed against the woman's 36-year-old boyfriend\", as ABC puts it.He reportedly told the authorities he'd taken his bog-bound girlfriend food and water every day, and asked her \"to come out of the bathroom\". Whipple said: \"And her reply would be, 'Maybe tomorrow'. According to him, she did not want to leave the bathroom.\"The former privy prisoner is now described as \"in fair condition at a hospital in Wichita, about 150 miles southeast of Ness City\", but has \"refused to cooperate with medical providers or law enforcement investigators\".Police are unsure if the lady has any mental or physical disabilities, but hospital reports claimed she was in a 'fair condition' although she had refused to give medical and law authorities her cooperation.Neighbour James Ellis said he'd known the woman since she was a child but hadn't seen her for about six years. He explained that she'd \"had a tough childhood after her mother died at a young age and apparently was usually kept inside the house as she grew up\".He concluded: \"It really doesn't surprise me. What surprises me is somebody wasn't called in a bit earlier.\"Many questions spring to mind, so it will be interesting to hear more about this case.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/13/wtoilet113.xml"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/03/time-out.html", "title": "\nTime out\n"},

It is not something i have heard of here in the UK (however I'm sure there are). There are many reasons for homeschooling. Some families make this choice on religious grounds. Many do it because of a dissatisfaction with the schools in their area or with the institutional effect of school in general. Others do it because their children are being bullied and abused by other children or teachers. It is also an alternative for families living in isolated rural locations and those who choose, for practical or personal reasons, not to have their children attend school.C and I are looking forward to doing our bit!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flatstanley.com/", "http://www.flatstanley.com/how.html", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Flat-Stanley-40th-Anniversary-Brown/dp/0060097914", "http://homeschoolnetc.blogspot.com/", "http://homeschoolnetc.blogspot.com/2008/03/romans-are-coming.html", "http://homeschoolnetc.blogspot.com/2008/03/all-things-englishtea-on-tuesday.html", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R-AmGHTuXCI/AAAAAAAAByY/sJiopcggRdw/s1600-h/Mr+Bean.jpg", "http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page1.asp", "http://www.mrbean.co.uk/", "http://homeschoolnetc.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/03/homeschooling.html", "title": "\nHomeschooling\n"},

This surprised a few people. I do drive but there are a couple of reasons I gave my car up. First because C finds cars very difficult as they go round corners roundabouts, and get stuck in traffic. He came very close a few times to putting his head through the car window, not much fun whilst trying to drive. The other reason is about 10 years ago I had an accident whilst doing one of those charity hikes in the Himalayas raising money for disabled children. Not the best place to have an accident! I blogged about it sometime ago, here and here.After 3 failed operations I was left with a drop foot which I cannot move, and in constant pain, hence making driving long distances rather awkward.It was difficult to get used to not having a car, but as we know you get used to anything. It has also meant I do a lot of walking which for my leg is properly a good thing. However for about a year now the pain in my leg has been getting worse, so last week I actually went to the doctors about it, I was a  bit shocked when she said I will have to have a knee replacement. But will have to wait till I a bit more debilitated.      Something to look forward to!!After seeing the look on Cs face (and no fingers in ears) in this photo, when I have my new leg I think I will have to invest in one of these Go kart things rather than a car!! But where would I put the shopping?!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/03/lights-out_29.html", "title": "\nLights out!\n"},

Thank you Ellee for reminding me.Every 15 seconds, someone in the United States suffers a traumatic brain injury. Of the 1,000,000 people treated in hospital emergency rooms each year, 50,000 die and 80,000 become permanently disabled.Some things to remember; 1. Wear your seat belt!In a car, truck or airplane, your seat belt will help protect your head and brain from injury. Motor vehicle accidents are by far the greatest causes of brain injuries, accounting for 37-50% of all brain injuries.2. Wear your helmet!Head injury is the most common cause of death in bicycle crashes accounting for 62% of all bicycle-related deaths3. Stay away from illegal drugs!Although damage done by some drugs can be reversed, some drugs may change brain function permanently4. Know the risks involved with sports!This applies mainly to boxing, football and the martial arts. However, even football, climbing, horseback riding, diving and skiing have risks. Always wear your safety equipment properly and be in good physical condition for your sport.5. Look before you leap!I know it sounds impossible, but people DO dive into swimming pools without water. Dive only in the deep end of the pool and make sure that the water in the lake and at the beach is deep enough to dive in head first. Also, be aware of any objects, such as large rocks, that may be hidden under the water. There are up to 1,000 spinal cord injuries each year in the United States when people dive into swimming pools or other bodies of waterAnd, you don't have to be knocked unconscious to sustain a brain injury. Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), also known as concussion , can damage your brain at the cellular level .Worse, repetitive head injuries , even minor ones, can have serious repercussions \u2013 including permanent brain damage or death.This is why my sons head banging is life threatening as he has had multiple concussions.

He is a person first.   What would your wish be?I saw this over at Whose Planet Is It Anyway? 'I could tell you so much more, but instead let me share one last insight.

{"date": "Friday, 4 April 2008", "body": "\nLouder than words.Do you ever find yourself trying to speak but the words don't come out? Or they do but its not what you wanted to say? You might be nervous or anxious or shy. Do you find it difficult to get your point across so that people understand? Sometimes writing a letter is easier as you can express yourself better.Talking is not always straight easy!My son doesn't speak. I don\u2019t know if C cant or if he has chosen not to. I don\u2019t know if it is an anxiety thing or if its too painful or difficult. He has also refuses to use PECs or signing, or any other assisted communications technology. As C has got older and i understand his autism better i respect these choices, but I will always offer him options as they arise. Such as FC. (You may have heard of Carly)When C was younger I used to long to hear him speak. I thought speech and language were important. If I am honest I wanted to hear him say \u2018mum\u2019 or \u2018I love you\u2019 just once. But as he grew without words, i began i realise that he didn't need a voice to say these things as he said them in many other ways.C learnt at a very early age that head banging was a effective way of communication. So effective that he still uses it, but now it is a last resort.C is by no means mute, when he is happy his high pitched squeals are ear piercing. And a delight! (the general public may think differently on this one!)C is very physical in that he rocks, flaps, flicks, paces, jumps, slaps himself all the time. C is reacting to his surroundings. He is communicating.  Amanda Baggs puts it like this\"My language is not about designing words or even visual symbols for people to interpret. It is about being in a constant conversation with every aspect of my environment, reacting physically to all parts of my surroundings.Far from being purposeless, the way that I move is an ongoing response to what is around me\u2026.The way I naturally think and respond to things looks and feels so different from standard concepts or even visualization that some people do not consider it thought at all. But it is a way of thinking in its own right.\" Words are only 7% of your communication. Tone of voice is 38% and the other 55% of our communication is body language.C uses 100% body language! \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://callcentre.education.ed.ac.uk/SCN/Level_A_SCA/Using_Symbols_SCB/Hot_PECS_News_HTA/hot_pecs_news_hta.html", "http://www.makaton.org/", "http://www.donnawilliams.net/fc.0.html", "http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080217/favaro_carly_080217/20080217?hub=Health", "http://www.answers.com/mute", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/", "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/the-language-of-autism/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/04/actions-speak.html", "title": "\nActions speak ...\n"},

Being the mother of an autistic child you have to be prepared for the more unusual eventualities.As you know C doesn't speak, but he also doesn't ask for anything like needing to go to the loo. I have to promt him, and of course i don't always get my timing right. So i used to have to carry spare clothes. (My timing is better now) Incredibly sometimes he wont go to the loo for days at a time, no matter how much i give him to drink.Yes i used to carry a swimming float. Any ideas as to why? Its light, portable and great for slipping in between Cs head and the surface he was headbanging on. (When small i would use my hand or foot, or bodily lift him away.) Now he wears a helmet.Pecs.....ooops wrong picPecs, i carried Pec symbols about for years, just in case he would start using them.And to some places i would take a portable DVD player.And of course a supply of chopsticks! Before the days of C having his fingers permanently in his ears he would never been seen without a chopstick which he would tap on his face, but occasionally they would fly off never to be seen again.Those days are behind me now and thankfully my bag has now shrunk. It also had to shrink because of my injury to my leg i can no longer carry heavy things.So now i just carry the necessities, our disabled bus and train pass, a carers card in case something happens to me. (I used to have an Alert card - but never used it) A Radar key - for public disabled toilets. Phone. Wet wipes for tomato Ketchup emergencies (he prefers to eat with his fingers) and he also will on occasion smear when out, but we wont go into that! Sudoku book and pen, notepad in case i have a blog brainwave - and a crystal.

{"date": "Wednesday, 9 April 2008", "body": "\nThe puzzle piece logo was first introduced by the British National Autistic Society in 1963, it depicted a sad child who did not fit. We have come along way since then and know a lot more about autism, social representations change over time. Autistic people do fit in society, so the NAS updated their logo. People with autism and parents are always challenging the way autism is portrayed. There is so much negative press, an image of a puzzle, with a piece missing, simply does nothing to raise positive awareness with the general public. \u201cThe usage of the infinity symbol as a representation of autism, started by Aspies For Freedom in June 2004, was a reaction to the negative connotations associated with the jigsaw symbol commonly used by parents to represent autism. The jigsaw symbol is seen by much of the autistic community as an insulting reference to the fact that autistics can appear puzzling, in need of \"fitting in\" with society, or as having \"a bit missing\". It was felt that the infinity symbol better represents autistics by representing logic, persistence, perseverance, and unity of form.\u201d\u201cAutistics. Org has responded to us parents by selling a button that reads, \"I am not a puzzle, I am a person.\" In addition, Oddizms has created a rainbow moebius ring with the statement: \"Many autism spectrum adults object to being objectified by the puzzle ribbon ... They want a different symbol and here is my offering\"I feel as parents we should listen to autistic people themselves. As the National autistic societies have updated their logos and their thinking - so should we parents.  And if you haven't seen it yet - you must watch Bevs video. Lastcrazyhorn has some beautiful art work as an alternative to the jigsaw.

But I was able to use this to speed up the final funding decision for his new adult placement, as it clearly showed that someone with Cs level of self injurious behaviour needs a long and clear transition plan, and time had been running out.We had been left hanging whilst the powers that be had xmas holidays, moved office and tried to pass the funding to other departments etc. It had even gone to their solicitors, only to find they couldn\u2019t get out of it.So we got the full funding for the package that C needs for his transition and adult place.A big relief.Last week we had a meeting with everyone involved with C plus staff from the new place. I was a bit of a nervous wreck the few days leading up to the meeting. But I was very relieved and somewhat surprised that for once people were being honest and taking the severity of C behaviour so seriously (usually its swept under the carpet as they don\u2019t want to be seen as not coping) .So I came away with a moving date and a very detailed transition plan that I felt happy with even though still very apprehensive.

I hadn\u2019t been back since applying for the funding. So I was very relieved that I still felt C will benefit from the move when he has settled. The facilities are more than i could have hoped for but much more importantly the attitude of the staff is positive, open and up to date. They have their own psychology team as well as art, music and speech therapists so C will have access to these if he wants them. As he is now an \u2018adult\u2019 it is all his choice (in theory!) To keep myself busy and positive I have been making things for his new room. C loves watching reflective light and will loose himself in these CD pics.And I have been rug making, they make great wall hangings as well as softening the blows his head takes.To answer some of your questionsMima - 6 weeks to go! Which isnt nearly as long as it should be or i would have liked.Niksmom - a lot lot closer only 40 mins away :)Chaininmagic - Thankfully everyone is taking Cs head banging very seriously. But yes I still am a nervous wreck!Honeysuckle said and I couldn\u2019t agree more \u2018isn't it sad that young people without someone able to fight their corner will end up without any help?\u2019I looked at 42 homes over 2 years. I was very fortunate to be able to do this and then go through the funding process.Menopausaloldbag - Yes it is a full time place (but he will still come home). How do I feel? A range of emotions. Excited for Cs future, hopeful that i have found the right place for him. Petrified about his head banging, especially in the short term. Upset that some people feel I am now at the end of my parenting and can now get a life, or whats the point of so much resources being put into a young man with Cs level of disability, and other such remarks. Plus all the other feelings a mother has when a child leaves school and goes into the world (times 100!)Stinking Billy - Thank you!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1067&a=4412", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SDwiymnbreI/AAAAAAAACCc/MWDt-rP5k88/s1600-h/Csnewroom3.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SD2Ei2nbriI/AAAAAAAACC8/8dGNvg4AW9g/s1600-h/Casdokrug1.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SD2EqmnbrjI/AAAAAAAACDE/95aN2lrYQ00/s1600-h/Casdokrug2.jpg", "http://mimad.blogspot.com/", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/", "http://myventsandreflections.blogspot.com/", "http://notabarrel.blogspot.com/", "http://menopausaloldbag.blogspot.com/", "http://stinkingbilly.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/05/visits-to-new-home.html", "title": "\nVisits to new home\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, 28 June 2008", "body": "\nWhen I am stressed or anxious I comfort eat, my weaknesses being cheese and pasta. C is the opposite, he wont eat at all, so will go for days without eating. So with Cs impending move we are both anxious and dealing with it in our different ways. Since the day C was born feeding has been a struggle. He would quite happily or rather unknowingly starve to death.Its not because he is a \u2018picky eater\u2018. Eating is a complex motor task as well as having many sensory issues, which C (I think) finds all too much at times. He finds using a knife and fork too difficult so prefers to finger feed, when he does eat. Chewing is also a problem. Hunger just does not seem to register. I recently read that his long thin bones are due to his diet, or rather lack of. No surprise there!C will have fads, if he eats it will be the same thing for a year or so, and then just stops eating it. But this has become shorter, becoming months.. It takes me a good few days of trial and error to find something else he will eat. (I wont go into the amount of food i have to bin.) He has also had fads of eating non food items (Pica)!I haven't had C tested for food allergies because the range of food that he will eat is so small. He does unsurprisingly have stomach problems, due to his not eating. Its a vicious circle. C is painfully thin, just laying in a bath will bruise his back as his bones stick out. I\u2019m just amazed how he has grown to over 6 foot or has the energy to stim in the way that he does, on such a meagre diet with hardly any variety. So i don't have any tips to share about helping your child to eat, i think i have tried most things. But would love to hear yours if you have any!I found this fascinating post and comments over at NTs are weird, which if your child has eating issues I think is an interesting read.Do you have any food fads?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/R-wCNzvudaI/AAAAAAAAB20/EXMlf9oXXHc/s1600-h/sensory+issues+Casdok.jpg", "http://www.apha.org/publications/tnh/extras/exclusives/AutismWebEx.htm", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SGPBzBrEX1I/AAAAAAAACDk/xW-V1hW-Rf4/s1600-h/CasdokC.jpg", "http://www.donnawilliams.net/dietaryinterventions.0.html", "http://thiswayoflife.org/blog/?p=213"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/06/food-for-thought.html", "title": "\nFood for thought\n"},
{"date": "Monday, 14 July 2008", "body": "\nC's world changes today. Everything and everyone he knows will change. My blond blue eyed little boy of mass destruction has grown into a handsome young man, is leaving school and moving into a home entering the adult university of life.(You can click on the word cloud to create your own) It amazes me where all the years have gone. My tiny little bundle of joy now towers over me. I had no clue when he was young what his future would hold. The old mental asylums were still open then, and have now thankfully mostly closed. Even our local day centre is closing and services are becoming more modernised. There is a lot more choice now for homes for autistic adults because of The White Paper, Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century. It is the first White Paper on learning disability for thirty years and sets out an 'ambitious and challenging programme of action for improving services.' Its about individual\u2019s wishes, choices, rights and goals. (about time to!!) And I and other parents will hold them to it but it can still be a post-code lottery.After all we may all end up in some sort of home one day.Since the White Paper ive seen a mother get a council house for her son and use Direct Payments to fund staff to go in.I\u2019ve seen a group of parents get together and buy a house for their children who know each other so they can stay together with their peer group.I\u2019ve seen a house built from scratch to accommodate a persons specific needs.I\u2019ve seen individual flats, small homes and larger more specialist homes (as I have chosen for C)There is more choice and I hope these choices continue to grow as autistic people are listened to more, and awareness grows. Care standards are much higher and homes are inspected regularly. The Government have also listened to the NAS and their I Exist campaign. But there is still much to be done and improved upon.I found this poem written by Wendy Lawson which she gave me permission to use. Change, change and more change,Of context, place and time.Why is it that life's transient stage,Plays havoc with my mind?You said,\"We'll go to McDonald's\"But this was just a thought.I was set for hours,But the plan then came to naught. My tears and confused frustration,At plans that do not appear,Are painful beyond recognition,And push me deeper into fear. How can life be so determined?How can change be so complete?With continuity there is no endSecurity and trust are sweet.So, who said that change would not hurt me?Who said my 'being' could not be safe?Change said,\"You need continuity\"In order to find your place. For change makes all things different, They no longer are the same.What was it that you really meant? All I feel is the pain. It is hard to tell how much C understands. He became more distressed with each visit to the new home (but at least they have seen his head banging and how I handle him) Two staff from school will be staying over night with him tonight. So as C moves and his anxiety takes over for the next few months, the only control he can exert in his new world are his bodily functions (in and out) and his head banging. I just hope his helmet does its job and he finds peace and trust soon. I hope it doesn't take C to long for him to train his staff! He certainly trained me well!I don't know when i will see C next, i am being given conflicting advice how long i should leave him before i see him, so i will just play it by ear and go with my gut feelings.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/40122/Untitled", "http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/SocialCare/Deliveringadultsocialcare/Learningdisabilities/DH_4032080", "http://valuingpeople.gov.uk/index.jsp", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=155&a=2417", "http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/DisabledPeople/FinancialSupport/DG_10016128", "http://www.csci.org.uk/", "http://www.autism.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=10", "http://www.autism.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1665&a=16356", "http://www.mugsy.org/wendy/", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SHr_L5J0OsI/AAAAAAAACE0/o8AeB4iMC6o/s1600-h/121475221516483z.gif"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/07/cs-world.html", "title": "\nC's world\n"},

{"date": "Monday, 28 July 2008", "body": "\nIf I had a pound for every time I heard someone say \u2018if he were my son I would give him a good spanking\u2019 or \u2018if he were mine I wouldn\u2019t take him out in public\u2019 etc etc - I would be a rich woman. Not one day has gone by when I have taken C out that I do not hear at least one derogatory hurtful remark about my beautiful son. So sadly I think Michael Savages\u2019 recent thoughtless comments on autism represents a proportion of societies views about our children.Wasnt C cute! And here's C when happy now;\n\n\n\n\nWhen i see C this happy my heart sings. But others find this large display of pure joy disturbing embarrassing and even frightening. We have emptied countless cafes, shops, or even been asked to leave.When C was diagnosed all those years ago many friends disappeared as they didn't know what to say or how to relate to C. Some didn't want their child 'catching' autism. Our world shrank as people kept away. Only recently C and i met up with someone we had known many years ago. We had a coffee - she went to the loo -and never came back.You get used to living on 4 hours sleep, cleaning poo off the ceiling, trying to find something C may eat. You get over wondering what his voice would sound like if he ever spoke. And there will always be another funding battle to fight. A new way of life emerges and becomes the norm.Other things take priority, the superficial, artificial and materialistic things are just that, they are things. C gives me so much more. A smile, a look, a delighted squeak. A licked clean plate (on those rare occasions). A licked clean train carriage window is more often.Our odyssey has not been easy. There have even times been times when I thought he was going to die. All the comfort I was given by doctors, was \u2018wouldn't he be better off dead\u2019.Society judge him, make fun of him, they film him on their mobiles. C has had dog biscuits thrown at him in the street, and once was even punched by a passer by. Some of my family are embarrassed by him, some say they are scared of him others pity me and give C no second thought. They don\u2019t see the beautiful being that he is, or the gifts that he shares. They don\u2019t see that C is happy and does have a quality of life. They cant get their heads round it, or rather they don\u2019t want to or even try.Living with disability can be tough at times, but you get there. It is also full of much love, joy and laughter. And i wouldn't have it any other way.It\u2019s the prejudice I find the hardest part. The attitudes of some family and friends and some professionals whom we are supposed to trust. And the strangers in the street.And that is on going. This is our reality. C by the very nature of his autism and challenging behaviour is isolated and in turn isolates me as his mother. This is also true of many other carers in many different situations. There are 6 million of us in the UK. 175,00 are under 18 years old. Carers save the country \u00a387 billion a year!!! (But C and i have just put a dent in that!)So I have been overwhelmed here in blog land that C and I have touched so many people. Especially as many of you are not parents of autistic children. Everyday there is a new comment or email spurring me on at this difficult and emotional time for both C and I.And i have been bestowed this beautiful Arte y Pico award by Exmoorjane, Mrs C , The dotterel and Jeff Deutsch. Thank you all so much.I would like to pass this award on to bloggers (I'm sure you all know the rules) who have also been through transitions.First Deb who's journey when her daughter went into a group home i followed in floods of tears. And has helped me so much to know she is now settled and happy.Honeysuckle who's was the first transition blog i found.Cheri who is now discovering herself after her children left home.e with her lovely blog who is about to go through a transition has reminded me that all mothers go through this.KC's blog. The whole family deserve many awards as they support each other through a difficult time.And Baking a wish, a blog i only recently found is filled with so much love.And as for C settling in to his new home from home. Progress is slow, and as yet I cant see the light at the end of the tunnel.

As was\u2018When I'm feeling blueall I have to do is take a look at you\u2019.Both songs are dear to my heart.And the road has been long, the road has also been beautiful. There have been many steep and rocky parts as well as a few pitfalls. We have met some wonderful people along the way, some of whom have travelled with us. 16 years ago I was struggling with C in a long post office queue and a lady came to our rescue. She has been my rock and best friend ever since.Looking back many things have become easier (like queuing) as I came to understand C and his ways and our routines became more established. I also learnt to deal with my stress better and C has learnt ways to help himself cope with things. It is very exciting as i feel C has many hidden depths that the world has yet to see.For Cs birthday treat i took him on the London eye, something i have wanted to do with C for years. But i didn't think he would be able to cope with being encased in a glass capsule 135 metres above London's skyline with no means of escape. Until now.Not only did C enjoy it but he also seemed fascinated by the whole experience.To me this shows how far he has come, and anything is possible. I was soo proud of him.C this is for you.

His new home is close enough for me to be able to just take him out for a day, which I did yesterday for the first time. We went to London to see the Liberty Festival. Celebrating the contribution of Deaf and disabled people to London\u2019s culture at Trafalgar Square.When I picked C up, I did a quick mental check of his appearance (as us mums do!) his hair needs a cut as do his nails, but as yet he is not letting anyone intrude on him that much. I looked at what he was wearing, as its weird what other people dress him in. Tee shirt- good, long shorts- good. He looked great- he looked gorgeous until I scanned down to his feet. Socks AND sandals!! Why do people do this to people with learning disabilities (I also see this in my home town). He\u2019s 19! C should be trendy and fashion conscious!So the first thing I did on the train was to take them off without getting my ears drums burst from Cs excited squeals.We arrived in London in glorious sunshine, the first we have seen all summer. Trafalgar square looked great and had a wonderful carnival feel to it, with music, comedy and caberet, performers, stalls, side shows and wafts of cooking smells.There was a lot to see, my favourite was Barbie imperfecta - The chance to mess with the media\u2019s idea of perfection, if you ever wished Barbie to look more like a real people this is your chance.I tried to put Barbie\u2019s fingers in her ears but she wasn\u2019t having it! What would you have done?Do you remember Chip? They used to be on street corners begging for money. Thankfully you don't see them any more. Barbara Lisicki 'freed' several of them and were asking people to give them makeovers!Cs favourite was feet watching.At one of the stalls I signed something, turned to walk away when I heard \"Casdok -are you Casdok?!\" I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting that! And ended up having a lovely chat with 2 very charming young men from the London Autistic Rights Movement, Roderick and Tom.These balloons then caught my eye as there was a leaflet with a photo of Amanda on it from her Getting the truth out site (which is under construction at the mo) The balloons stood for people trapped in the care system without access to information and communication technology. I couldn't stand and chat to the people from AutreachIT at this display as C had had enough by then.So hot and weary we went back down on the tubes which C cant get enough of! (Quickly walking past this poster!)And then headed south back to Cs home. He was not impressed to be going back so soon after a lovely day out. I found it hard to as he didn\u2019t want me to leave. Fighting back the tears I said goodbye and handed over the offending pair of socks.This Kick Ass blogger award is from Bobbie. Thank you Bobbie.I'm only supposed to pass it on to 5 other Kick Ass bloggers which is not easy as most parents of Autistic children have to kick ass!

{"date": "Wednesday, 5 November 2008", "body": "\nToday is National Stress Awareness Day. Thinking over C\u2019s life I have been most stressed when C is in pain either through self injury or when he has been ill and it has been difficult to diagnose as he wont let anyone near him, so sometimes the illness gets left untreated for long periods because of his self injury. And then when diagnosed it is difficult to get medication down him! It can be a vicious circle.We all feel and show pain differently. We all tolerate different amounts of pain. Some of us even like inflicting pain on ourselves.People look at C and assume because of his head banging he must have a high pain threshold. But when he is in pain he head bangs more. Others see it as this is just what C does. Not that he is trying to tell us something.  So I was very interested to read this summary of a local project that has recently been done.The project involved talking to people with learning disabilities, residential and day service staff and carers.The project found that;14% of day staff,33% of residential staffand 66% of family carersthink that people with learning disabilities have a higher pain threshold than people with out learning disabilities. There is no evidence that people with learning disabilities have a higher pain threshold than other people. 86% of day service staff said that they had taken medication for pain within the last 3 months. Only 4% of people with learning disabilities had been offered medication in the same period of time79% of residential staff that they had taken medication for pain within the last 3 months.Only 39% of people with learning disabilities had been offered medication in the same period of time.We all need to know that;People with learning disabilities feel pain as badly as other people. People should not have to be in pain.People with a learning disability may not say they are in pain, but their behaviour might change. (doesn't every ones?!) We need to find out if people with a learning disability are in pain before saying they have \"challenging behaviour\".Staff and carers can use pain picture cards with people. However for some like C who is unable to use picture cards so pain signals and treatment should be identified in the person\u2019s Health action plan.  Staff need training in pain recognition and management. Health screening needs to improve.In July this year there was an Independent inquiry into access to healthcare for people with learning disabilities. The inquiry was ordered in response to Mencap's \u2018Death by indifference' report, which told the stories of six people with a learning disability who we believe died unnecessarily while in NHS care. Did you know GPs are getting \u00a3100 bonuses for carrying out health checks on people with learning disabilities. Shouldn't they be doing this anyway?!So in light of National stress awareness day, Ive had my say - now over to you - so what makes you stressed?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nationalstressawarenessday.co.uk/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SQyN6kJBkkI/AAAAAAAADTQ/-IuWl7ZMPcU/s1600-h/hooks.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_scale", "http://valuingpeople.gov.uk/dynamic/valuingpeople142.jsp", "http://www.iahpld.org.uk/Healthcare_final.pdf", "http://www.mencap.org.uk/case.asp?id=52&menuId=53&pageno=", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7707769.stm", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SQ4ASIqn3ZI/AAAAAAAADTo/tp1kVWvFw_g/s1600-h/th_Stress-ZebraStripes.gif"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/11/stress.html", "title": "\nStress\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, 27 November 2008", "body": "\nC just loves to watch peoples feet as they pass by - he can get very excited much to the shock/horror and amusement of those passing. Their jaws drop to the floor, some stand rooted to the spot as they try and understand what they are seeing. Some trip as they aren\u2019t looking where they are going. And of course you get a range of comments made.To be fair many people do not even notice him and some are very friendly and come over for a chat.C does this everywhere we go. He has a favourite spot in our local shopping centre near the base of an escalator, there is also a cafe where my friend and I catch up over a latte keeping our eyes peeled for any potential trouble, whilst C is in his sensory heaven.The security guards know us well (as we have been doing this for about 10 years now) and keep an eye on C as in the past there have been the odd incident of small gangs of kids surrounding C. I have become hardened to the comments and the stares but its teenagers filming C on their mobiles that I cannot ignore. And this seems to be happening more often. C seems totally oblivious to it all!But as C is so happy watching feet - he\u2019s not in anyone\u2019s way and keeps himself to him self I am not going to stop him doing this. So what can I do? Any ideas?My friend and I have found if we pretend to film the filmers they soon stop. Last week I actually took a photo of 2 lads thinking I will put it on my blog. But of course that would make me as bad as them - so I haven\u2019t.I did email my local police to ask if it was illegal to take photos of someone without their consent. And apparently its not!! \"It is not illegal to film or take photos of anyone although if the group of youths are the same group who continue to film your son this could potentially be harassment which is an offence.\" So does this mean different youths taking films is not harassment??! I decided to write to a few other organisations to see if anyone could offer advice. And thought I would share the responses, they weren't very helpful but some of the links may be useful to others who are being harassed. Mencap saidThank you for your email. Unfortunately we are not in a position to advise on this situation, however there are a few organisations I would suggest you approach. You could try the Citizens Advice Bureau. You might also find it useful to approach Chilndet, who provide information on Internet safety, or Respond, who offer counselling and advice/support on abuse for people with a learning disability. I emailed Respond but they haven\u2019t responded! The NAS suggested i contact Community Legal Advice.I emailed The Office for disability issues;For guidance on your son's rights under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) you may wish to contact the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). The commission is an independent organisation which provides advice and information to disabled people and the general public, amongst others, on a range of subjects, including on disabled people's rights under the DDA. website at http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/Pages/default.aspx.The DDA prohibits discrimination in the context of employment, education and transport, and the provision of goods, facilities and services.The DDA says that harassment occurs where, for a reason which relates to a person\u2019s disability, another person engages in unwanted conduct which has the purpose or effect of violating the disabled person\u2019s dignity, or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading or humiliating environment for him. A new provision, explicitly outlawing harassment for a reason related to a person\u2019s disability, was introduced in 2004. It does not, however, cover hate crime, general harassment in public places, or specific types of abuse.However, other legislation may be relevant. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 provides some protection against harassment and the Criminal Justice Act 2003 places a statutory duty on sentencers to increase sentences for offences aggravated by hostility towards the victim because of his or her disability.You may also wish to have a look at the Crown Prosecution Service's policy statement on disability hate crime: http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/disability.html.You may also wish to note for example (pg. 46) that the Department for Children, Schools and Families has convened a taskforce on \"cyberbullying\". See also the proposals concerning removing inappropriate content from such sites as YouTube (pps. 32-37).Yours sincerely,I emailed the Equality and Human Rights Commission - they just suggested I contact a solicitor. My Case manager has also flagged C up to the Police Vulnerable Adults Unit, so they are aware of C and what is happening. There are various Autism awareness alert/information cards that I could hand out but I was thinking of designing my own - what would you write on it?

{"date": "Friday, 12 December 2008", "body": "\nI wasn\u2019t prepared for C growing up so fast!!C has been in his group home 5 months now.I wasn\u2019t prepared for the adult world being so different to school. We try and prepare our kids with transitions but no one prepares the parents. I wasn\u2019t prepared for the nightmare sorting C\u2019s benefits out. I should have known better!. I wasn\u2019t prepared for the number of socks they loose! Guess what C needs for xmas! I wasn\u2019t prepared that since C\u2019s move he would loose nearly 8lbs in weight. And as you know he cant afford to loose weight. I wasnt prepared for the first 3 months they didn't take C out. That's why i did the post about When labels dont help.I wasn\u2019t prepared that as C wont let anyone near him to cut his nails (some are now ingrown) or brush his teeth that he now has gum disease and will mean he will have to be knocked out. This why i did the post about stress and pain.I wasn't prepared to receive in the post a 'Service User End of Life Policy statement' - (they had prepared me that i would receive a letter about staff Christmas holiday rotas) it was very gruelling reading., about how they would lay his body out and dispose of his possessions.I am used to seeing psychologists pretty charts of Cs head banging with usually little or no explanations or actions. But I wasn\u2019t prepared at Cs latest review to see this chart of the frequency. Their intervention plan said \u2018may prove challenging\u2019. Very helpful.! But it dose explain why they are unable to clean his teeth and cut his nails and not take him out etc etc . But they didn't tell me all this. Did they really think because C does not speak or sign - I wouldn't notice these things? Also interesting the only part of the graph they showed me was where there was a dip.Maybe I should have for seen all this as I knew C would find the move hard but I hadn\u2019t realised what it would mean to his health. To be fair to them I think all this would have happened anywhere C had gone.I do think C is now over the hardest part for him. He is now a bit more trusting of a couple of the staff and i now have a couple of allies to tell me things. So there is at last a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.The other week when C was home I was buying a train ticket for us both - turned round and he was gone. As in a puff of smoke - but there was no smoke!! And no I wasn\u2019t prepared for that! Even though I have lost C a few times in the past - its been a while! I scanned the ticket office, I scanned outside my mind going into over drive as all the stories I had read on Autism Vox and F.R.I.D.A. flashed through my brain. I ran over to the man on the ticket barrier and asked if he had seen my son \u2018oh yes I let him through\u2019 I dashed past rounded the corner and found C waiting looking very distressed. Phew!On the way back I asked the man on the barrier why he had let C through - he told me C was following someone who looked liked me but with longer hair! I had my hair cut during the week.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SUFtxn1uAYI/AAAAAAAADXU/S5WruXJaX0o/s1600-h/Missing+socks.jpg", "http://www.lonelysocks.co.uk/", "http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/IntegratedCare/Endoflifecare/index.htm", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SUFrkW1csFI/AAAAAAAADXM/3Ek_G6WAHtI/s1600-h/light+at+the+end.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SUFrkEjCckI/AAAAAAAADXE/4Yso39NYBv0/s1600-h/puff+of+smoke.jpg", "http://www.autismvox.com/", "http://fridanow.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/12/wasnt-prepared.html", "title": "\nWasn't prepared\n"},

His current home have now been told that he is leaving- oh you should have seen their faces!! So we are now working out a transition plan. In the mean time C and I have had some great days to distract usC enjoys the London eye so much whilst waiting in the queue he was so excited (big loud stimming!!) they gave us a pod to ourselves!!   As C seems to love views I had wanted to take him up the Spinnaker tower in Portsmouth. So when I heard DJ Kirkby was doing a book signing there it was a great excuse to go!The above photo is C standing on Europe\u2019s largest glass floor 100 meters up. And we both very much enjoyed a Duck Tour round London. The tour is both on land and on the river Thames. C only tried to dive in once!I have known Lucy Baxter for years and was not at all surprised to see her stirring up public opinion recently. Some of the things she said were of course taken out of context. But has highlighted a taboo subject and much needed debate. Seeing our young men as adults with feelings not perpetual children who listen to nursery rhymes.I would like to wish my brother well as he does a charity bike ride for MS in America. I just hope he doesn't end up like i did when i did my charity hike in the Himalayas. Let me know if you would like to sponsor him :)And last but not least.I wasn\u2019t going to go on the London Autism Rally yesterday as to advertise it they were using such words as epidemic (which as you will see here is not a good word to use) and a few other words I did not agree with. But the organisers said they wanted to try and include everyone, and they did change some of their wording. So when the London autistic Rights Movement asked C and I to go to promote neurodiversity we did! Here are some photos.There were many banners from pro -cure to anti-vaccine so i am very glad i was there with The London Autistic Rights Movement to make the case for acceptance. However to on lookers it must have been very confusing. Out side Downing street.We ended up in Trafalgar square.I met some lovely people and was asked on several occasions why I didn't want to cure C. So i came away feeling as though i had done my bit.

Thankfully they just tried to talk to him as he was acting suspiciously!!!! I stepped in, and they left with apologies.Incidents like these (its not the first time) are the least of Cs and my worries at the moment. Its been 2 months now since I made it known to Cs case manager that I want to remove C from his group home. Nothing happens fast as they have to have holidays.  So am playing the \u2018funding game\u2019 which is why i cant just take him out. Thankfully years of experience of this has held me in good stead even though it is different in the adult world, but I am getting there slowly.Cs home has not improved and to give you a taste of their ethos this is the CD they gave C for Christmas. And yes this was after C had been to a night club! And that was after they told me what they were giving him and I told them in no uncertain terms that I felt this was totally inappropriate (or words to that affect!). They went ahead and gave it to him anyway.I wont go into how this made me feel as I'm sure you can imagine.It has been taking a toll on my health. Being a single parent is hard at times. This being one of them making such huge decisions, especially as I don\u2019t want to get it wrong again.I have found another home, an assessment has been requested. The new home is not autism specific, and they have the opportunity for independent living for the future which is great as I do love the idea of this, but not just yet for C. I recently went to a meeting at The London Autistic Rights Movement which was very inspiring.I in 5 care homes inspected by the CSCI fail to meet the national minimum standards. Which does not say much for the state of social care in the UK. There is a culture change from not just the size of the room and where the medication is locked up to more about needs and expectations particularly equality dignity and human rights and with the new Valuing people now document this will continue over the next few years.Disability has been in the news this week. Apparently we have a new scary CBeebies presenter!!And I am sure you have heard the very sad news of the loss of David and Samantha\u2019s son. My condolences go to the family.And in Milan on criminal charges of defamation and privacy violation in regard to a video posted on Google\u2019s Italian site of a young man with Down syndrome. Not sure that it will get anywhere, but at least it is being taken seriously, as you know this affects C.The Autism Bill is being debated in Parliament today, it has had great support. So i look forward to hearing the outcome. Just heard apparently it went very well and is now through to the next stage. You can watch it here.And i would like to say thank you to Suzanne for making me this beautiful dress which was inspired by my CD and C's love of reflective light. I was really chuffed!And i would also like to say thank you to Cathy, Neo-Conduit and Viva Vavoom for all giving me awards which i have put on the side bar of my Faces blog.Norah - could you email me as i pulled your name out of a hat to win a signed copy of the Shrep rap :)Think that is all my news for now. Will be back again to let you know how things are going.

Maybe there is hope for the rest of us!Earlier this week I attended the Carers UK summit which was very interesting. There were lively debates and voting on many topics. Phil Hope MP, Minister for Carers gave a great speech. Because he has some first hand experience of caring he knows many of our issues. He is very new in his job so hopefully very enthusiastic. He urged us all to email our MP\u2019s so to keep our views on the political agenda. Carers UK do some excellent campaigning and influence many policy makers. And is free to join.  There was a wall where we could put up our thoughts.Whilst in London I also took the opportunity to visit Stephen Wiltshire\u2019s gallery. I\u2019ve seen his pictures on TV and on his website, but it was great to see his drawings in person. He is very talented. I treated myself to 3 of his prints (well post cards as couldn\u2019t afford the originals!) Stephen also sent me this photo to my on my Faces of Autism blog which you may have seen.  So a great day in London, but I did miss not having C with me on the packed commuter trains as people give us a wide birth! Other news:Id also like to mention my dear friend DJ Kirkby (who I had the great pleasure of meeting a few weeks ago). DJ was diagnosed Asperger earlier this year (by the same person who diagnosed C!) and has written a book which comes on sale soon - so a great idea for a Christmas present! Tickets are on sale for what sounds like an exciting book launch. I am hoping to travel down with the beautiful Halo - your welcome to join us!And Kev at LeftbrainRightBrain has launched a new website called Autism Myths - its worth checking out.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SR1an_YOsCI/AAAAAAAADUg/Wyj2axbWURo/s1600-h/es.jpg", "http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/misshapen-fruit-and-veg-laws-set-to-be-scrapped-1013731.html", "http://www.carersuk.org/Home", "http://www.philhope.org.uk/", "http://findyourmp.parliament.uk/commons/l/", "http://www.carersuk.org/Aboutus/Joinus", "http://www.stephenwiltshire.co.uk/gallery.aspx", "http://casdok-facesofautism.blogspot.com/", "http://djkirkby.blogspot.com/", "http://djkirkby.blogspot.com/2008/01/party-time.html", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1843", "http://djkirkby.blogspot.com/2008/10/something-little-different-to-stuff-in.html", "http://djkirkby.blogspot.com/2008/11/lazy-sunday_09.html", "http://beautifulspectrum.blogspot.com/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://autism-myths.org/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/11/hope.html", "title": "\nHope\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, 27 January 2009", "body": "\nAnother night for me to remember. And what a night!!DJ Kirkby\u2019s double book launch of her new book 'From Zaftig to Aspie' and her partner Christopher King\u2019s new book \u2018Motorbikes, ducks and crispy sweet apples\u2019. It was a wonderful evening listening to readings, drinking complementary peach champagne, meeting other bloggers and listening to a live jazz band. But for me the high light of the evening (which all came about by chance) was seeing Daren Callow performing the rap that I had written (my very first blog post). It was quite overwhelming to hear my words come to life. I hope you enjoy it - if you do you can find details on Daren\u2019s blog here or website of how you can buy it. Any money made is to go to charity.Watch it hereYes thats me signing copies! If you would like to win one let me know and i will put your names in a hat.Other news. This may not come as a surprise to some. I have decided to take C out of his group home. It is not what I want for him and no amount of talking to them has changed anything. Of course this is not straight forward (hence I have been quiet). And after a very near miss in my local shopping centre last week when part of the ceiling collapsed onto the table and chairs my friend and I had been sitting at only moments before. (We had moved to a table nearer to where C was stimming as he feet watched.) It has made me even more determined not to waste time. C needs to be somewhere I have confidence in.Valuing people now: a new three-year strategy for people with learning disabilities is now out and highlights all the things i have been saying to Cs home.I will keep you posted.Some of you may have seen on my Faces of Autism blog that I have at last added C along with my 3 year old nephew. I\u2019m finding it very difficult not to overload my sister with info! But it is really good to hear the vast difference in attitudes of professionals and services that are around compared to when C was diagnosed. However there is still room for improvement!Like this new advertising campaign. It certainly doesn't help new parents like my sister or autistic people themselves. Sharon over at The Voyage (and others) are asking for support to get this ad cancelled. The new campaign by Action for Children TV advertisement portrays autism as a monster to be defeated, a monster with the nice well behaved boy trapped inside. Please pop over to Sharon\u2019s to see what you can do to help.I have also made an appointment to see my MP about the Autism Bill to try and urge him to support this bill. You can email your support here.And as they say \"That's a rap!\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://djkirkby.blogspot.com/", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1849239924?tag=exquisitedrea-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=1849239924&adid=0VNQERPRX8J5C236HZ7Y&", "http://fullofbullshite.blogspot.com/", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1849239916?tag=exquisitedrea-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=1849239916&adid=04TEZMW3T8MY7Y48RZDA&", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SXtRYr4XgZI/AAAAAAAADa8/Bb2amkcrM5E/s1600-h/CD+cover.bmp", "http://dazza68.blogspot.com/", "http://dazza68.blogspot.com/2009/01/radio-play-and-shrek-rap-cd.html", "http://www.darencallow.co.uk/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SX9Gq3XvYUI/AAAAAAAADbM/fMdk_G9KSro/s1600-h/Casdoksigningshrek04.JPG", "http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=WmdfqevzJ6E&feature=channel_page", "http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_093377", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SXtRJotCrNI/AAAAAAAADa0/y3303SMtS9E/s1600-h/joe+and+c.jpg", "http://casdok-facesofautism.blogspot.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SX2XLv7I8RI/AAAAAAAADbE/1rsuf_ytDa0/s1600-h/4517.jpg", "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/", "http://www.actionforchildren.org.uk/", "http://findyourmp.parliament.uk/commons/l/", "http://www.autism.org.uk/autismbill"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2009/01/shrek-rap-single-brought-to-life.html", "title": "\nShrek Rap - The Single.

{"date": "Monday, 13 October 2008", "body": "\nEvery week C\u2018s home send me a photo.This one sent a few weeks ago - Cs finger speaks volumes! (even though it was inadvertent)I haven\u2019t written much about Cs new home as things have not been going to well. I expected settling in problems, but not the ones that C ended up facing.The home I spent 2 years searching for, the home I felt had the right attitude and would be right for C has totally let both C and I down. I have been gutted. C's last 2 visits home I haven\u2019t wanted to take him back. (Note to self. The Managers of these places do a good PR job but its the hands on staff who do the actual caring, and can be a different story)As C does not speak or sign all I have had to go on his appearance and body language (which I am very good at). And what the staff tell me - which hasn\u2019t been much.I was very concerned about what I was seeing. I thought the staff were trying to get away with as little as possible. Neglecting him and not taking care of his basic needs and welfare. But in reality what I found was that staff were taking the line of least resistance/avoidance as they were frightened of him. (Shrek lives up to his name!) Not a good start. (Note to self - trained staff does not necessarily mean confidant staff. )The labels that preceded C to the home have not helped. Low functioning. Challenging and self injurious behaviour. And of course they would have read all his reports and spoken to staff from his school who would have told them some horror stories.So they were seeing his labels and not C as a person first. Putting mountains in the way that need not have been there.But after making some \u2018big\u2019 complaints and much talking with the home with the help of my Case Manager I think we have sufficiently kicked them up the back side and things have thankfully started to improve for C. Many thoughts have been going round my head through all this (especially at night) if this was the best home i found -what must the others be like. And my concerns about what will happen when i am no longer around to keep on top of things have quadrupled. So i need to work harder on encouraging and supporting them (!!) instead of being upset with them. (Note to self. Research back up plan if it doesn't improve enough and i feel i need to take him out)And I was also shocked and find it hard to believe to be told that I am 'rare' as a parent. That not all the people in C's home (and other homes) have concerned parents who take an interest and want to be involved for a variety of reasons. I find this very sad. But it is also no excuse for them to do their best. (Note to self. Offer to adopt one of the other residents who has no one looking out for them)  I came home to a parcel yesterday a \u2018framed\u2019 photo of C in the homes sensory room, laying on a vibrating mat, listening to music and watching a bubble tube, looking happy and relaxed. I took this as an apology from the home and trying to show me that C is ok.Its going to take a lot more than that to regain any trust. But at least I feel they have got to message, and i appreciate the sentiment. Actions speak louder than words and they are at last making the right actions.Time will tell.I hope my next post will be more cheery!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SPHiJn5WIAI/AAAAAAAADN8/rEs24DJjuI4/s1600-h/C+gives+the+finger+08.jpg", "http://www.peoplefirstltd.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SOudAxj121I/AAAAAAAACTc/Kdxzol79yDw/s1600-h/always+another+mountain+Casdok.bmp", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SPHiXtMaOnI/AAAAAAAADOE/Woz6LzTYz5s/s1600-h/relaxed+C.jpg"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/10/when-labels-dont-help.html", "title": "\nWhen labels don\u2019t help\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, 16 May 2009", "body": "\nWhilst waiting to move C from his present group home I have been having C home more. In the last couple of years he has been more receptive to going to new places which is fantastic. So in a bid to try and wear him out (he doesn\u2019t sleep much) we have been trying new things. But i only seem to wear myself out! The latest was Do-nutting (as we are not bound by risk assessments!).Here\u2019s a short video clip to illustrate what it is...\n\n\n\n\nTrying to get C to sit in a Do-nut was a feat in its self \u2013 and took some practice! After I had manoeuvred C into positive and then got myself seated my do-nut \u2013 I looked up and C was gone! You\u2019re supposed to wait till everyone is ready and then all go together! I had to run down the side of the slope to catch him up as I knew he wouldn\u2019t know what to do at the bottom and wasn\u2019t sure how he would respond to a member of staff talking to him. I only managed to beat him down the slope as he was using his size 10\u2019s as breaks!!That was the only mishap. C needed a bit of time out after that in the furthest corner.This time he held on till i was ready.Great fun! The aches and pains the next day were worth it!We are top middle on way downOver the last 20 years I don\u2019t know how many letters/emails/phone calls of complaint I have made advocating on C\u2019s behalf. I try and make them constructive and have had some very positive outcomes not just for C but for others to. I have changed attitudes and some policies. But it can be very wearing. Having a good social worker on your side supporting you can make a lot of difference. I have been very fortunate with my social workers (on the whole). Social services tend get a bad press, and yet many work tirelessly. As well as complaining I also think it is important to give praise where praise is due. So when I saw Health and Social Care Professional of the Year Award were looking for nominations \u2013 I nominated my social worker. My nomination has been accepted and we both have been asked to attend the award ceremony next month. In the mean time they are sending a film crew to film both my social worker and I and possibly C?! \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.alpinesnowsports.co.uk/alpine_snowsports_donuts.html", "rtsp://v2.cache3.googlevideo.com/ChoLENy73wIaEQm7-5q6M_qqJhMYDSANFEgDDA==/0/0/0/video.3gp", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Sg2rfKJ7XWI/AAAAAAAADkM/JtIC9WiyF84/s1600-h/Doughnut1009.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Sg2qvszQK2I/AAAAAAAADkE/B9xUbn30ZOk/s1600-h/Doughnut809.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Sg2p_j_DmCI/AAAAAAAADj8/9gnMqbbr3vk/s1600-h/Doughnut1109.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Sg2pQxbCoZI/AAAAAAAADj0/9_HYanhaDyQ/s1600-h/Doughnut1209.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/Sg2okuJMtXI/AAAAAAAADjs/LI-DofrVxVQ/s1600-h/Doughnut1409.JPG", "http://www.southeastcoast.nhs.uk/whatwedo/BestofHealth.asp"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2009/05/do-nut.html", "title": "\nDo-Nut\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, 21 July 2009", "body": "\n2 weeks till C moves. Sleep alludes me as thoughts run round my head. Visits to C\u2019s new home are going as expected \u2013difficult, traumatic. But each visit getting a little easier, its hard to know how much he understands. In this last year he has worn his helmet out \u2013 and I want to put him through a move again. The decisions we make for our children are over whelming at times.And both C and i have been managing our stress in different - but the same ways.After 2 years of searching for a home a specialist home I thought would meet C's needs where he could grow, and had the right experience to cope with C\u2019s level of challenging behaviour. But I knew after only 3 weeks it was not the right place. But I gave them a chance, and C a chance to settle. I tried talking to them. But the things they did continued to shock me, sadden me. I started looking elsewhere. I don\u2019t entirely blame myself. Their initial assessments should have shown them it was not the right place for C. But they went ahead. They did a good PR job on me. They failed my son. This time I feel the assessments have been a lot better and I have been involved. I was actually asked to go over Cs PCP \u2013 a first. I\u2019ve been made to feel my insights into C are valid and useful. After all C has been training me for nearly 21 years.I am also being involved in some important consultations where I can put C\u2019s/my experience to good use. You can get involved too. And maybe we can save other people from going through what C and many others have had to endure.Adult autism strategy consultation and theConsultation on new registration standards The CQC\u2019s draft guidance is very encouraging and positive. They will have new powers to \u2018enforce\u2019 standards and will not just have an impact on ALL care homes but other care providers such as GP\u2019s, dentists, hospitals etcAutistic people need allies and not just from parents. When C was small my motivations were getting him the right educational support etc. My views have evolved over the years and its now more about his human rights, dignity, respect and choice.If we cant change the attitude of people who work with people with Autism what chance do we have with the rest of society.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=528&a=15199", "http://adultautismstrategy.dialoguebydesign.net/", "http://www.cqc.org.uk/getinvolved/consultations/consultationonnewregistrationstandards.cfm", "http://www.cqc.org.uk/", "http://www.autistics.org/library/allies.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKCxwDF-SrI"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2009/07/future.html", "title": "\nThe future\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, 23 June 2009", "body": "\n At last I have a moving date for C - in 6 weeks.  Which is a huge relief.  And this time I feel more prepared as I have some idea how C will react. But I also have different concerns this time as C has regressed in so many areas since his first move and after 11 months is not yet back to where he was. But I know the new home will be more suitable in the long run so hopefully C will settle quicker this time and begin to regain what he has lost.Over the years I tried many messy tactile substances in messy play to deter C from smearing. But never found a good enough substitute! He still smears but these days it is thankfully a bit more contained. Trying to keep C\u2019s nails clean though as he won\u2019t let anyone cut them since he moved is very difficult. Any advice gratefully accepted! This weekend my sister and her husband went away and I looked after my nephews J (3.5) who is Autistic and O who is just 10 months. So I put my messy play to good use. It is great for gross and fine motor skills, coordination, concentration, observation, communication and stimulation of all the senses.\n\n\n\n\nJ has never liked the feel grass under his feet but really enjoyed getting his feet gooey. We enjoyed pouring, scooping, grasping, transferring, catching, placing, exploring all with lots of eye contact.And without even realizing J was soon walking on the grass!

{"date": "Monday, 1 June 2009", "body": "\nUnlike child abuse and animal abuse (The Children's Act and The Protection of Animals Act), there is no single piece of legislation that deals with the abuse of vulnerable adults.We all know a vulnerable adult, a disabled or elderly member of the family or a neighbour. So this concerns everyone.Through out out history people have abused their power like Hitler. Or their trust like Dr Shipman. Or parents like Josef Fritzl. Or so called specialist centers like the Judge Rotenburg Center. (Facebook group)It is still happening today. Every day. Abuse takes many forms. A young man Jesse Moores tragically died. His death could have been prevented (Facebook group) if someone had just spoken out.No Secrets is the current Government 'guidance' in EnglandGuidance does not carry the same status as legislation; instead local authorities have their compliance assessed as part of a statutory inspection process. With \u2018good reason\u2019 a local authority can ignore such guidance. As a consequence vulnerable adults do not have the same statutory protection as either children or animals. Such crimes as mistreatment are regularly committed 67% according to Action on Elder Abuse in care settings and by carersThere is a raft of legislation keeping people safe from harm (Human Rights Act 1998, Care Standards Act 2000 and Regulations, Mental Capacity Act 2005). However, prosecutions are very low.Most councils have recognised that protection (safeguard) of vulnerable adults is paramount and have implemented multi-agency policies and procedures to protect vulnerable adults from abuse. It is our duty to look out for the signs and to do what we can to prevent it. Staying silent is not an option.Vulnerable adult definitionA vulnerable adult is a person aged 18 years or over who is or may be in need of community care services by reason of mental or other disability, age or illness; and who is or maybe unable to take care of him or herself, or unable to protect him or herself against significant harm or exploitation.Everyone has a right to:Live free from violence, fear and abuseBe protected from harm and exploitationBe independent \u2013 which may involve some riskSay 'No' to anything they don't fully understandForms of abuseInstitutional abuseInstitutional abuse can occur in a care home, nursing home, acute hospital or in-patient setting and can be any of the following types of abuse:Neglect.Physical abuse.Sexual abuse.Verbal abuse.Discriminatory abuse.Psychological and emotional abuse.Financial abuse.NeglectNeglect of a vulnerable adult can be any of the following:Not having the help you need to have a bath or shower if you are unable to do so by yourself.Not getting enough food or drink.Stopping you from accessing needed care and/or medical services.Not being given the medication that has been prescribed for you.Being given medication to make you sleepy when it has not been prescribed or giving you the medication at the wrong time or in the wrong quantities.Not getting help to stay warm and dry.Only having old or dirty clothes to wear.People not caring for you properly.Professional abuseProfessional abuse happens when a professional does any of the following:Takes advantage of their client or patients trust.Exploits their vulnerability.Does not act in their best interests.Fails to keep professional boundaries.Abuse may be:Sexual.Financial.Psychological/emotional.Physical/neglectful.Discriminatory.Professional abuse always involves:Betrayal of trust.Exploitation of vulnerability.Violation of professional boundaries.DomesticAny incident of threatening behaviour, violence or abuse (psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional) between adults who are or have been intimate partners or family members, regardless of gender or sexuality.Discriminatory abuseAbuse of individual rights is a violation of human and civil rights by any other person or persons.Discriminatory abuse consists of abusive or derisive attitudes or behaviour based on a person's sex, sexuality, ethnic origin, race, culture, age, disability or any other discriminatory abuse - this includes Hate Crime. Elder abuseCan be any of the following:Physical abuse.Psychological abuse.Financial abuse.Sexual abuse.Neglect.Abuse can occur anywhere:In some one's own home.A carer's home.In a day care centre.In residential care.In a nursing home.In hospital.Both older men and women can be at risk of being abused. The abuser is often well known to the person being abused.The abuser may be:A family member.A friend or neighbour.A paid or volunteer care worker.A health or social worker, or other professional.Older people may also be abused by a person they care for.Financial abuseCan be any of the following:Someone making you take your money out of the cash machine for them.Taking money from you.Borrowing money and never giving it back.Stealing your belongings.Someone getting you to sign something and you don't know what it is.Someone taking your pension or other benefit.Someone asking for money for visiting you socially.Physical abuseCan be any of the following:Being restrained in a chair or locked in a room.Punching or kicking you.Throwing things at you.Grabbing, pushing, poking or slapping you.Hitting you with an object.Pulling hair or biting.Tripping you up.Psychological and emotional Hurtful criticism.Name calling.Sulking.Pressure tactics.Lying to you, or to your friends and family about you.Persistently putting you down in front of other people.Stopping you from seeing people you want to see, including friends and family.Never listening or responding when you talk.Monitoring your phone calls, emails, texts and letters.Checking up on you, following you, not letting you go out alone.Frightening you into doing things you don't want to do.Making you unnecessarily distrustful of other people.Upsetting you on a regular basis about things that don't matter to the extent that you may even feel unwell.Psychological and emotional abuse is generally part of other forms of abuse such as:Domestic abuse Sexual abuseSexual abuse can be any of the following:Someone touching you where you don't want to be touched.People getting too close to you.Someone making you feel uneasy and upset.Someone hurting you and making you feel scared.People not listening when you say no. Additional factorsAny of these forms of abuse could either be deliberate or the result of ignorance or lack of training, knowledge and understanding. If a person is being abused in one way they are often being abused in other ways too. What to look out for:Unexplained injurySigns of fear or distressWithdrawalNeglectTheft, fraud or financial exploitation What you should do:Do act if you suspect a vulnerable person is being abusedDo talk to the person \u2013 listen carefullyDo give the person your full attentionDo telephone someoneWhat you should not do:Don't ignore itDon't promise to keep it a secretDon't put it off (there needs to be better whistleblower provisions )Autistic children grow into Autistic adults all too fast. I have been very grateful over the years when staff have \u2018off the record\u2019 told me things that have happened to C. I hope with greater awareness of Autistic Adults because of campaigns like the NAS I Exist and Safeguarding adult\u2019s and better quality controls things will continue to improve.After all we could ALL end up in a care home one day.Safeguarding Adults is every body's business.

{"date": "Friday, 14 August 2009", "body": "\nI still can\u2019t quite process the fact that C\u2019s new home is working really well!!Learning from all the negative things the last home did, I talked at length with this new home - they have listened and put everything into practice.It hasn\u2019t all been plain sailing \u2013 but it is positive. The last home C refused to let them take his helmet off. This time C is refusing to let them put it on him. Rather worrying for me, but his head banging has been minimal, and the staff have been learning fast. So he was obviously telling them he didn\u2019t need it.Apart from listening to both C and I. The main reason it\u2019s working out so well is at the moment C is the only person in the home. The provider has about 12 homes across the county, they had a few vacancies (because of people moving into independent living) so had a reshuffle making C\u2019s home just for school leavers. C being the first one in there means anyone else moving in will have to be compatible with C. He has about a month before the next person moves in giving plenty of time for the staff and C to get to know each other. I couldn\u2019t have asked for better timing.And talking of good timing. The week C left the old home I received a questionnaire from the Autism Accreditation programme (they review every 3 years) asking my views on the service provided! As you can imagine I had a lot to say! I am also taking up C\u2019s experience with the Care Quality Commission.So as C\u2019s life is picking up and beginning to take on a new positive shape I am trying to come back down to earth after a couple of years of stress. I am so relieved I had the strength not to give up and accept things as they were. It at times has been very emotionally wearing but so far touch wood it has been worth it.I can recommend Bach flower remedies and Lavender fields.Am off to Autscape next week - should be interesting :)\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SoRdrS1va_I/AAAAAAAADns/lm8TeYwyw_w/s1600-h/emotions1.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SoRWpe1KgFI/AAAAAAAADnc/pHVHC8SzOd8/s1600-h/emotions.jpg", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=146", "http://www.cqc.org.uk/", "http://www.bachshop.co.uk/catalog/?gclid=CKOEzPikoZwCFaAA4wodCHmZdQ", "http://www.mayfieldlavender.com/", "http://www.autscape.org/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2009/08/touch-wood.html", "title": "\nTouch wood\n"},

A lovely afternoon out with lots to see. I took C last year, but this year I went on my own which meant I could stand around and watch things \u2013 which I can\u2019t do with C (unless its trains or feet!) There was much going on...From comedy to music.To aerial street art from Blue Eyed Soul and dance. The story Swan for children and talented Mouth and foot painters.Marc Brew showed a very touching performance \u2018Nocturne\u2019 which if C had been there I had visions of him stripping off and bouncing on the beds (as he has done before in public!).There were stalls. BBC Ouch was there, Attitude is everything, Unison, Disability Law service, The Olympics to name but a few. Last year there were a few Autistic things going on, but sadly I didn\u2019t see any this year.The lovely Tracey was there from The Independent Living Alternatives was there whom I met last year when she gave a talk to the London Autistic Rights movement (who remembered me as Monster Munch!) and was desperately trying to find something for C when things were going wrong for him. But even though I do like the idea of Independent living I find it hard to see how it would work with someone like C who is so vulnerable and easy to take advantage of, especially after our recent experience of staff. But who knows what the future holds. Would love to hear of where it is working.Antony Gormley\u2019s fourth plinth had a lone person on it - a living monument , who must have had a great view of what was going on. There has been a parent up there raising awareness. And Julie will be there on sept 15th. I also applied to do this - but so far no luck - will call upon you all for inspiration if I do!I love Antony's work and blogged about his exhibition I went to a few years ago and how it related to C. C is continuing to do well and I am happy with how it\u2019s going. He is looking so much better, standing up straight, smiling, a glint in his eye. Change though is hard for C and he is still head banging more than I would like, the calcified oedema on his head has become puffy as it fills with fluid before hardening. And that\u2019s what I can see on the outside of his skull \u2013 what is happening on the inside?

These are all forms of communication \u2013 I just have to try and work out what C is trying to say. Sometimes it is quite obvious and other times it has taken years to work out. After 20 years I think I can read C quite well! The majority of stress for both of us still comes from the so called \u2018professionals\u2019 who think they know better.

But I know what would happen if I did. And it is not about me.So I walk into C\u2019s room, he spies me with his peripheral vision. And then he looks at me, head tilted upside down, fingers pressed into the corner of his eyes. C hums loudly to drown out anything I might say. So I whisper in short sentences not directed at him but to the birthday present I am holding. His humming becomes quieter as if he is straining to hear what I am describing. I don\u2019t give C the present as I know he will push it away so I open it and leave it in his room for him to look at in his own time. But I know he won\u2019t touch it, he hardly ever touches anything, his fingers are glued in his ears. C doesn't want for much, I have to be inventive. So apart from a few presents I give him experiences \u2013 memories.Because of C's love of loud music we went to see We Will Rock You.And for his love of travelling fast and in straight lines we went on a speed boat trip on the Thames.I could not blog without mentioning the dehumanizing (on so many levels to both Autistic people and parents) Autism Speaks video. But I have been finding it hard to put into words how it has made me feel as a parent of a young man who is 'low functioning' (I hate that term as C 'functions' as best he can) Even though C does not speak - with patience and understanding I learnt to listen to him.His first school would not listen to him so I fought for one that did. His first group home did not listen to him so I found one that does. All without voodoo or fighting a disease \u2013 but fighting a system and by doing so I hope we have educated a few people along the way in their attitudes and listening skills.By accepting C's Autism and working hard to help him I am not a warrior, or victim or hero. I am a mum who listens to my sons needs - it is C who has had to do the real hard work every day.So don\u2019t listen to Autism Speaks and their negative stereotypes.(Excuse me while I have a C moment humming loudly with fingers in my ears) With the right attitude and support and understanding children like C grow into adults who do have a good quality of life.My son was not robbed from me and nor were my dreams.I still want for C what any mother wants - for him to be happy healthy and fulfilled without pity and prejudice to reach his full potential.We are hopefully on the right track. Happy birthday C! I did manage to get 1 kiss in! You have taught me so much. I am so very proud. May you carry on touching peoples lives.

{"date": "Tuesday, 20 October 2009", "body": "\nFor me what has been the toughest - C\u2019s Autism or his severe learning disability? Neither it\u2019s his behaviour\u00a0that is so challenging\u00a0because of sensory distress\u00a0that has shaped both our lives.\n\nWhat struck me very early on in Cs life was the injustice/stigma he has had to face on so many levels because of his behaviour that has challenged and people don\u2019t see that he is a person first doing the best he can.\n\nI found this recently that I had written describing C\u2019s early years. By C proofing the house, early specialist intervention and continued support, C has come a long way since then. It hasn\u2019t been easy for either of us but I hope my blog is testament that you can get to a place where even with ongoing challenges life can be enjoyed.\n\nIts 2.30 am. I am woken by the sound of head banging. He\u2019s awake, I\u2019d better take him down stairs before he wakes everyone.\nI climb over the stair gate to be hit by the stench of smeared faeces. I trip on the ripped carpet, the curtains are on the floor. The woodwork is chipped from thrown objects and teeth marks. There are holes in the walls from his head.\nHow do I get him down stairs? If I pick him up I am I danger of being hit, kicked, bitten scratched and my hair pulled out. I go and get a biscuit and lure him out.\nNow what do we do in the long dark early hours. He does not watch TV or play. I had better take him out for a walk \u2013 but that means I have to somehow get him dressed. I\u2019ll have a cup of tea first. I\u2019ll have to drink it standing up as if I sit down I am attacked.\nEverything in the house is locked, hidden, stuck down or tied up. Anything he can lift is thrown, kettle toaster etc etc. I cannot take my eyes off him for a second. But I do to pour the tea. CRASH. My husband won\u2019t be happy, it\u2019s always my fault. He has put his head through the safety glass on the TV. I had better put his helmet on. I bend down in front of him \u2013 he knocks me out cold with a single head butt.\n\nMy son is only 3 years old.\n\nI can\u2019t take him to the shops or other people\u2019s houses. No one comes to see me anymore. Neighbours cross the street when they see us coming. I am given respite but that doesn\u2019t last long as they can\u2019t \u2018contain\u2019 him.\nHe goes to an SLD school. They call me to pick him up as they can\u2019t cope. They start restraining him.\n\nMy son is only 4 years old.\nUsing ABC charts (which is a bit of a pain, but did help me to understand) and Positive Behaviour support we were able to listen and help C a lot in those early years. And I learnt not to reinforce his behaviour with biscuits!! Or to kneel in front of him to put his helmet on. I found a specialist school for C with good SALT support as communication is the key. But C in his wisdom chose not to learn PECS or any signs as his head banging works so well for him. But sometimes he takes it too far and knocks himself out. So this we are still working on. And now as an adult a good PCP is the key.\n\n\"It is not a matter of what causes self-injury or what causes aggression or what causes stereotyped or repetitive movements but for each of these difficult forms of difficult behaviour, what does it do for the individual, what purpose does it serve for them in their life?\" E. Emerson\n\n I recently spent a couple of days with The Challenging Behaviour Foundation and met other parents of young people around C\u2019s age. And even though their diagnosis varied they were all SLD with severe CB, the experiences and impact this had had on our lives and the paths we took interestingly were very similar. And most of our children had been subject to restraints both physical and chemical. Exclusion and seclusion, not only within the system that is there to try and support them but from family and friends as well. Despite all this what shone through was we all had a great sense of humour even though we were tackling a very serious subject.\n\nThe other thing that gelled us together is we had learnt to \u2018play the game\u2019 through networking (for me I sat on committees) and empowering ourselves with knowledge. (wish I had had the internet in those days!)\n\nThe Challenging Behaviour Foundation is expanding and doing some very important work and hopefully will be reaching more families and professionals. They offer a range of information and support . They have a very useful set of 4 DVDs which would benefit anyone who is starting on the challenging behaviour road. . You can phone the CBR helpline as they give these DVDs free to any families caring for someone with severe learning disabilities.\nTheir UK number is 0845 602 7885\n\n\n\nC is still settling in well. He has had 2 months on his own in the home which has given the staff and C a good chance to get to know each other. A young lady has now moved in and as his routines are now established he hasn\u2019t seemed to mind. However he still won\u2019t let anyone near his nails, but I think when the day comes that he does, is when I know he has truly settled in.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nas.org.uk/autism", "http://www.bild.org.uk/05faqs_7.htm", "http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=behavior&section=main&subsection=fba/abc", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_behavior_support", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1757&a=3771", "http://www.pecs.org.uk/general/what.htm", "http://www.makaton.org/", "http://www.inclusive-solutions.com/pcplanning.asp", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/St2KNFGaeFI/AAAAAAAADrY/ImUbP_VLtSk/s1600-h/cbf-logo.gif", "http://www.thecbf.org.uk/", "http://www.thecbf.org.uk/", "http://www.thecbf.org.uk/howwecanhelp/forprofs.htm", "http://www.thecbf.org.uk/resources/ipack-chall.htm", "http://www.thecbf.org.uk/howwecanhelp/forfamilies.htm", "http://www.thecbf.org.uk/resources/dvd-resources.htm", "http://www.thecbf.org.uk/howwecanhelp/contactus2.htm", "http://www.thecbf.org.uk/howwecanhelp/contactus2.htm"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2009/10/challenging-behaviour.html", "title": "\nChallenging Behaviour\n"},

Crystal Jigsaw\u2019s daughter is doing well with support as is my 4 year old nephew with his early intervention; they are threatening to reduce both their hours.\n\nEven as parents we do it. C recently gave me a sharp reminder of this. I\u2019ve been taking him on the London Eye for a while now which he loves. A couple of months ago on our way to the Eye because of engineering works our journey had to change and I didn\u2019t heed the early warning behaviour signs and use any proactive strategies, all I could do was react when it was too late, but C was too far gone and there was nothing I could do. I\u2019m sorry C. \nGreen \u2013 calm and relaxed\nAmber \u2013 anxious \nRed \u2013 incident\nBlue \u2013 calm down but may reignit\n\nWe have been back on the Eye with the moral support of a blog friend \u2013 thank you Mother X and boys.\n\nStaff can also become complacent about people\u2019s behaviour. In Cs case I\u2019ve heard staff say C self injures because that\u2019s what he does. They don\u2019t expect anything else. Not - why don\u2019t we look at why he\u2019s doing it and address it. Thankfully Cs new home are not complacent about this and have realised sometimes he actually causes himself pain (after the London Eye incident he had concussion for a week) and through using a version of the Abbey Pain scale. Which can be found at Dis Dat (as C can\u2019t use pain pictures) they were able to monitor how he was feeling.\n\n  The CQC are implementing new regulations next year across all adult health and social care services. They have done a huge public consultation and are still consulting with various groups \u2013 carers being one of them. From this - services are to be more (the \u2018in\u2019 words are!) transparent and accountable to everyone, carers will be more involved (if they want to be) even when their person leaves home. I have therefore approached C\u2019s service provider and suggested they start a relatives group to benefit their residents and staff and ensure good practice and hopefully no one will fall into the complacency trap. They have readily agreed. \n\nHave you any stories of complacency and/or how to avoid it?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://crystaljigsaw.blogspot.com/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/SwWmCACwirI/AAAAAAAADsY/IfN_NkzGFz8/s1600/Casdok+REDAMBERGREEN.jpg", "http://diaryofmotherxlivingwithautism.blogspot.com/", "http://www.dementia.unsw.edu.au/DCRCweb.nsf/resources/DCRC+Products+2/$file/11_Abbey_scale.pdf", "http://www.disdat.co.uk/", "http://www.cqc.org.uk/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2009/11/being-complacent.html", "title": "\nBeing complacent\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, 1 April 2010", "body": "\nBefore C was 18 I was always able to give parental consent to things. Now he is an adult \u2013 I can\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t been an issue till now. \nWe went to the dentist (hospital dentist that we waited over 6 months to get the appoinment)! And no surprises C did not let the dentist anywhere near him.\nC has gum disease (you can see it when he gives one of his enormous smiles) Teeth cleaning he can\u2019t do himself and depending on his mood depends how long he will tolerate a brush in his mouth. Diet over the years has been very poor. And he has acid reflux (which affects teeth as do some medications). He does not always show when he is in pain. I explained all this. But the dentist was very negative. \n\nThe NHS has a responsibility to ensure equality of provision of care to all groups in society. There is published evidence that people with disabilities are at risk from higher levels of oral health problems, they tend to have fewer teeth, more untreated decay etc.\n\nSo if they know this - why so evasive? Maybe the look of horror on the dentists face when she saw C head banging explains it?!\n\nA week later the dentist got back to us and has called an in best interest meeting.\u00a0 To see if it would be in C\u2019s best interest to have a general anaesthetic or just to leave him till he tells us he has a problem. But of course we would somehow have to work out that it was his teeth making himself injure.\n\nWe also have to prove C\u2019s lack of capacity in making a decision. It is assessed on if he cannot do one or more of the following: (He cant do any)\nUnderstand information given to them about the decision. \nRetain the information for long enough to make the decision.\nUse or weigh up the information as part of the decision making process. \nCommunicate their decision by any means such as talking, sign language or blinking.\n\n\nThis is from the Mental Capacity Act (MCA DOLS) which were introduced in 2005 after a man with autism and learning disabilities was prevented from leaving hospital. His carers took the case to court where it was found he was deprived of his liberty unlawfully. So to prevent further breaches and provide legal protection for vulnerable people who may need to be deprived of their liberty in their best interests, the MCA DOLS were put in place.\n\nThere is an easy read version here which actually uses a case like C\u2019s and they did agree to a GA. I know there are risks attached but trying to look at it from C\u2019s point of view the risks from his head banging are greater.\n\nSo if C is granted this we are also going to ask \u2018permission\u2019 to cut his nails.If C were a real person\u00a0 he would have the same privileges as neurotypicals and not have to prove his capacity or have best interest meetings (in 2 months time!).

{"date": "Tuesday, 5 January 2010", "body": "\n\"If I could snap my fingers and become non autistic, I would not - because then I wouldn't be me. Autism is part of who I am.\" Temple Grandin And that is how I see C. Autism is part of who he is.Therefore I have never given any thought to the hypothetical question of \u2019curing\u2019 C of being himself. Autism is his way of being. So I feel it is not my choice to make. It is not about me.Jim Sinclair says it very well in his article Don\u2019t mourn for us.I was thinking of giving up blogging as C is doing well. Or maybe just doing the odd post if I had something to say. So when I saw this post - as C and I were talked about in some of the comments I felt it warranted a reply. So I gave it some thought.And this is what I \u2018honestly\u2019 think...I see Autism more of a difference than a disability. But I do see C disabled by society by attitude and prejudice, exclusion, lack of resources and at times the wrong support, Etc.So if I were to give C a magic pill \u2013 a brain altering drug. Would he become \u2018normal\u2019?? Or would he still be 1 of thousands of NT people who self harm? Or would he be an NT who goes to heavy metal concerts and head bangs?! Would he still have gastro problems? Still thrive on little sleep? Would he still prefer to be a nudist? Would he still have a foot fetish?! Would he still get excited standing on platforms in his anorak watching trains? Would he loose his passions and excitement of the things most of us don\u2019t even notice?These are all normal traits that C already has. OK so maybe a bit more extreme!There are many tangents/debates around all this. Low and high functioning. What about other comorbid conditions. Children who have tragically died from various therapies or restraints. Or murdered maybe from fear or lack of support? Disability is normal. Parental genetic testing? Prevention. Eradication.So what do we really mean by cure? To make someone conform? To be socially acceptable? Assimilated into the collective?!Why can\u2019t society accept everyone is different?The journey to acceptance is different for everyone as we each have our own issues to deal with I have seen some parents get stuck at different stages (especially anger). And as a society we take even longer as we have seen with differences of ethnicity, gender etc. Diversity is overlooked within groups and produce stereotypes that can reinforce prejudice and discrimination. And so it goes on.Yes life has been very difficult at times for C and so in turn for me. But there is also much joy.From the first day C started head banging (he even does this when happy) i have looked for ways to give him other means to communicate. He had early intervention. Went to the best schools i could find and has been under a Challenging Behaviour specialist team. I continue to look for ways to help C communicate without hurting himself. And make sure there are people around him who understand him and want to support and help him to. And C continues to show progress at his own pace. Acceptance doesn't mean doing nothing.We all struggle at times. No one is truly independent. C does have a quality of life even with severe challenging behaviour. Which is what I have tried to show through by blog rather than \u2018blowing roses\u2019. Education is the key. Not only for our children to help them reach their potential but to society as a whole in raising awareness as one of the biggest problems that I see is the way many people view autism.It\u2019s such a shame that this hypothetical question divides our community. Follow upHarold has continued this discussion on his blog - Autism Cure?

Not only that but then when offered a choice of DVD\u2019s he said \u2018that one\u2019.\nI\u2019m still trying to get my head round it! Did she miss hear? Was it wishful thinking on her part? I don\u2019t know. But until more than one person hears C say something (if he ever does again) am trying not to get too excited!! But I never dreamt that his first word would be hello!! Very polite!\n\nI was very honoured to be part of the editorial team for the Autism Strategy. And was excited to see what they had done with it when it was finally published and sent out on March 3rd. But I must admit to being very shocked - pleasantly so when I opened it to find a photo of C on the front page!\nFulfilling and rewarding livesBut this photo was taken at a not very fulfilling or rewarding time of his life. Some of you may remember when he was in his archaic first home they framed and sent me this photo after I had made several complaints about his treatment, (I actually blogged about this very photo at the end of this post back in 08!) I think they were trying to show me he was happy. So it doesn\u2019t bring back very good memories.\n\nBut that aside I think the autism strategy is a good foundation to build on. Health and social care professionals and the public sector (i.e. the Police) will be given training in autism. So will depend largely on how good and extensive this training is. And local authorities will have to include autism in their planning of services.\nThe CQC have published their first yearly report on the state of health and adult social care in England. State of Care. Together with their new regulations which are based on Human Rights and with the Autism Strategy things are looking hopeful.\n\nI wonder what C will say next?!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_113369", "http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_113405.pdf", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/S4_SSn86sBI/AAAAAAAADvA/iCEFrrdTPqQ/s1600/casdok+autism+strategy.jpg", "http://www.cqc.org.uk/aboutcqc.cfm", "http://www.cqc.org.uk/stateofcare.cfm", "http://www.cqc.org.uk/aboutcqc/howwearerun.cfm"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2010/03/c-spoke.html", "title": "\nC Spoke!!\n"},
{"date": "Monday, 17 May 2010", "body": "\nC\u2019s best interest meeting to determine his ability to consent for a GA didn\u2019t go as I expected. It was straight forward and very positive!! Everyone easily agreed that C does not posses the capacity to consent so his human rights have been denied (sounds awful doesn\u2019t it) so we have the go ahead. We will next have a pre op meeting to try and sort out how we are actually going to go about administering\u00a0the GA\u00a0(with least risk to himself and others) as sedatives and tranquilizers have little or no affect, you can\u2019t prepare C with social stories or pictures, visits etc nor distract him. And his fight AND flight responses are acute!\nIt was also agreed that we could take blood to test for various things, But no decision as yet was made about cutting his nails. \nI am not at all looking forward to this as we have been though it once before and know how traumatic C (and I) found it. His self injurious behaviour is these days usually brought on by the actions of others (Suit you, sir? - brilliant article - a must read for staff) and this will be one of those times you can\u2019t avoid.\n\nWe agreed to use clinical holding techniques with a cut off point if not working. build have produced a code of practice for physical interventions. Am researching other ways to avoid this if poss \u2013 any suggestions welcome!\n\nBut at least these days they are prepared to give oral care to people with learning disabilities. It is not that long ago expectations were so low and basic privileges were denied. Children were labelled \u2018in educable\u2019. LEA\u2019s have only had to educate all children with special needs since 1970. Long stay hospitals are nearly all closed. Here\u2019s a harrowing reminder of what those days were like - loss of individual and social identity, gender identity, family identity to name but a few \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t that long ago\n\nAttitudes are changing.\u00a0We no longer have to shut our children away, or put up with babysitting (of adults and children) without meaning and value. We want the best education not just \u2018training\u2019. Opportunities, real choice and respect. Person first and neutral language. Personalization across all care settings. To be free from bullying on and off blog.\nWe are no longer afraid to rock the boat and ask for more. We want the same rights as everyone else. Laws are slowly catching up and being updated because of pressure as parents and disabled people\u00a0have much information at their finger tips and\u00a0higher expectations. We need to continue to challenge low expectations.\nRespecting and involving people who use servicesPeople understand the care and treatment choices available to them. They can express their views and are involved in making decisions about their care. They have their privacy, dignity and independence respected, and has their views and experiences taken into account in the way in which the service is delivered.As of October 1st the inspections that the CQC do of adult care homes will be based on 2 laws: Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2010 Care Quality Commission (Registration) Regulations 2009.The law that care homes are inspected under at the moment is the Care Standards Act 2000 \u2013 this legislation will come out of use. Which means things will be less process driven and more in tune with person centered approaches so outcomes should actually meet people's needs, \n\nC\u2019s service provider have been great as they are listening to me (and C) and are very receptive. C is one of the youngest therefore my thoughts are different to what they are used to. So my stirring input I feel has been constructive.\nC has been stirring too!\nThe most exciting thing about both these photos is apart from feeling happy and relaxed enough to take his fingers out of his ears \u2013\u00a0C is doing these things independently and not hand over hand! (I have never seen C press a button before on his own!)\u00a0Possibilities for\u00a0Facilitated communication ??? Or i may have to invest in an iPhone with the new Grace app (picture exchange) Great initiative Lisa \nBut what i would dearly love for C would be to be able to turn his TV or radio on himself (especially in the middle of the night!).

We had been referred to a private hospital because it is smaller and quieter. Through the Challenging Behaviour Foundation parents email network it had been suggested to use Rohypnol as a pre-anaesthetic as you can\u2019t taste it, smell it, it knocks you out and you can\u2019t remember. Perfect. But in the UK it is not licensed, if you have an understanding GP you can get it privately. C\u2019s GP agreed, a week later changed his mind. He also wouldn\u2019t give permission to do a blood screening (haven\u2019t a clue why?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not wanting to take responsibility?\u00a0)\n\nThe hospital wanted C to go in and have 3 MRSA swabs (underarm, groin and nose \u2013 I don\u2019t think so!!) and they wouldn\u2019t believe C\u2019s manager that there was no way C would allow this intrusion, they were adamant as they had much experience of autism before!!!! This is when the label autism isn\u2019t much use as people have general pre conceived ideas. \n\nC went to the pre-op meeting with an entourage. Me, key worker, home manager and the service provider\u2019s psychologist. So I felt well supported. We had agreed beforehand that we would not restrain C as this is just too traumatic for all. \n\nAgain they went on about the swabs, I tried to explain about the intensity of C\u2019s SIB but it wasn\u2019t until our psychologist said firmly he could fracture his skull that we got through to them. They were very good after that!! C also did some happy head banging which shocked them which also helped. They also didn\u2019t agree to the rohypnol, but did agree to taking blood and cutting his nails.\n\nThe day of the op soon came. We gave C 10mg\u00a0diazepam before leaving the home. C was going to be first on the list but because no MRSA swabs he was last so we had to wait. Wasn\u2019t too bad as C was oblivious to what was about to happen. 25mg of midazolam was given to C in a drink \u2013 enough to knock anyone out. But not C!! He had other ideas, as soon as he had finished the drink he looked at me and then ran and lunged at the wall smashing his head, he did this again and again and again. I tried in vain to distract him, stop him to no avail. He wasn\u2019t going to stop. I looked at the psychologist through tears and we all agreed to leave.\n\n\nWe walked out the hospital. Shocked hospital staff chased after us. (Like a scene from Benny Hill\u00a0I can sort of laugh about this now but at the time it was very serious) Got in the car as staff tried to talk us into staying as they were worried about C\u2019s breathing, C continued to head bang, so we drove. C calmed and was now fighting tooth and nail to stay awake. The hospital phoned me on my mobile and we went back to talk to them. The consultant and various staff were waiting for us at the road side. I agreed to give it one more go as apparently now 40 mins on the drug was at its peak and they assured me that C would not remember, and I didn\u2019t want to put C through all this again another day. A wheel chair was brought out as they said C would not be able to walk. I opened the door, C got out and walked! Much to the amazement of staff. He was pliable enough now to let us guide him straight into the theatre where we held a mask over his face until he did eventually pass out. We were ushered out. \n\nDidn\u2019t have to wait long till we were called back. Blood had been taken, his nails were short (looked weird) and they had done 1 filling (which could explain some of C\u2019s unexplained SIBs?) there was also some erosion on his back teeth from reflux. But after 21 years of not being able to brush teeth and poor diet \u2013 quite impressive. The consultant said because of the 'trauma' to Cs head he would recommend a referral to a ......... dermatologist?!! And C would not have to come in to visit a dentist again \u2013 the dentist would go to his home annually. So maybe they did learn something that day?\n\nWe were then told C would sleep for the rest of the day because of the amount of drugs and GA in his system. Half an hour (I held C\u2019s hand for a whole half an hour :)))) \u00a0)\u00a0later C was awake and up. We were out of there!\n\nSo we got there in the end, but at what cost to C\u2019s head. It\u2019s frightening and left me feeling emotionally exhausted for a couple of days. How it made C feel I can\u2019t imagine. We have to do this again in 5 years. I will push harder for rohypnol next time. Has anyone any experience of this - or anything else that would work better?\n\nI really hope they are right and C won\u2019t remember.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thecbf.org.uk/", "http://www.urban75.com/Drugs/rohypnol.html", "http://www.cks.nhs.uk/patient_information_leaflet/blood_tests", "http://www.christie.nhs.uk/publication_scheme/docs/MRSA_Screening_policy09.pdf", "http://www.institute.nhs.uk/quality_and_service_improvement_tools/quality_and_service_improvement_tools/pre-operative_assessment_and_planning.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/TBzufTPl4vI/AAAAAAAADw4/xhFtPf_0p_0/s1600/Casdoknoneedles.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midazolam", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/TBzuFpX2n3I/AAAAAAAADww/9mApMOrcwBc/s1600/MotherofShrekrunning.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Benny_Hill_Show", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2010/06/operation-tooth-and-nail.html", "title": "\nOperation tooth and nail\n"},

Soft play walls, easy clean floor. Bullet proof windows. \n\nAnd recently I have pulled up the stair carpet and painted a stair runner\u00a0as in the words of Mason the Chimp from Madagascar who says it so eloquently. It wasn\u2019t just the mattress that\u00a0was being flung down the stairs.\nI tried supplements like Melatonin, herbal and homeopathic remedies. Badger balm to Camomile tea (cooled and squash added) etc.. but no affect. \nI had to rethink.\n\nSo if none of this works and as all behaviour is for a reason....\n\nIt usually boils down to one of these\nAttention\nEscape from demand\nEscape from attention\nTangible\nSensory\n\nAs\u00a0not being able to speak does not mean C has nothing to say.\nSo what is he trying to tell me??\n\n\u201cIf you want to change the other persons' behaviour, a good beginning might be to start seeing things from their perspective\u201d \n\nC is 21. 21 year olds go out clubbing all night. OK so they then sleep all day and Cs not doing that.\n\nIt\u2019s his choice!? Who am I to say he HAS to sleep?!\n\nWe often wrongly assume others needs are the same as ours.\n\nSo I have to put aside my own needs and expectations of my ultimate desire of a night\u2019s sleep as I realise after months \u2013 this is not Cs goal.\n\nOr another theory\n\nWhen C\u2019s away he\u2019s worked hard at making sense of chaotic sensory experiences and then can\u2019t switch off when he comes home. He needs the down time to process and doesn\u2019t sleep instead he is engrossed in repetitive behaviour (which I won\u2019t go into) lowering his stress levels and exerting control. This has now become a cycle - an unstoppable loop. \n\nSo I need to look at ways to change the routine and break the loop.\n\nI bring him home by different routes. I change what and when he eats, what he is watching etc These things don\u2019t work\n\nI use Cs repetitive behaviour to \u2018talk\u2019 to him. I copy him so I\u2019m not overloading him with my stuff, I am validating C as a person in his own right. I am trying to get him to engage with me and not just himself. I stim, sharing sensory sensations, I squeak, orienteering myself to our common language, I talk Shyriiwook (the neighbours must think there is a Wookiee convention!) \nEvery movement, flick, tap, hit, rhythm, sound is an expression of feeling, letting me glimpse into C\u2019s inner world. Deepening trust, reducing anxiety and gaining self confidence. Relating.\n\nThis is the behaviour I changed \u2013 mine. \nI stopped doing this in the evening. I stopped engaging \u2013 talking to him, looking at him. And its working - slowly (hope I\u2019m not speaking too soon!). He\u2019s stopped exerting his control over me by literally physically holding me hostage. He\u2019s still not sleeping mind you but happily babbles to himself which I can sort of doze through. Only the odd thing flies down the stairs. And I can try and catch up on my sleep when he is not there! \n\nYou would then think I would sleep for England but I don\u2019t. My mental Tardis is on over drive and I can\u2019t turn my radar ears off. So I am now using all the alternative stuff I tried on C to help myself so I can stock up on sleep before the next round.\n\nWell that\u2019s my theory! That\u2019s my Duct tape \u2013 and I\u2019m 'sticking' to it for now (with copious amounts of coffee!)\n\nWhat have you tried?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/TI0Hk0wlybI/AAAAAAAADyI/fR-4GFEy88c/s1600/imagesCAGV4H1U.jpg", "http://www.insomniacs.co.uk/TheEffectsOfSleepDeprivation.html", "http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/helping-your-child-with-autism-get-a-good-nights-sleep", "http://www.rateitall.com/i-944445-duct-tape-is-like-the-force-it-has-a-light-side-and-a-dark-side-and-it-holds-the-universe-together.aspx", "http://www.here-be-dreams.com/bedroom/sound-conditioning.html", "http://www.sensorydirect.com/", "http://noahsworldllc.com/", "http://en.allexperts.com/q/Autism-1010/autism-water-beds.htm", "http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/01/02/warm-feet.aspx", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/TIz6W3jbeSI/AAAAAAAADyA/rMQjnTsXxZw/s1600/stairunner.bmp", "http://nestegg.typepad.com/nest-egg/2009/11/painted-stair-runners.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgUwpb3I98M", "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Shyriiwook", "http://www.soundboard.com/sb/Chewbacca_Sound.aspx"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2010/09/sleep-deprivation.html", "title": "\nSleep Deprivation\n"},
{"date": "Monday, 23 August 2010", "body": "\nI remember very well the post DJ Kirkby wrote a couple of years ago when\u00a0Denyse was diagnosed (at 40 years young) and \u2018came out Asperger\u2019. Denyse said \u2018 I am still the same DJ Kirkby except that now instead of feeling cross with myself for finding everything such a struggle, I am filled with a sense of pride at all that I have managed to achieve\u2019.\nSince then Denyse has had her first book From Zaftig to Aspie (a memoir) published. And Denyse is about to launch her second book \u2013 a novel\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without Alice.\n\nI am asked to review many books on\u00a0my blog\u00a0\u2013 all of which I turn down, even this one! Instead I took the opportunity to ask Denyse some (tongue in cheek) questions. Denyse would also be more than happy to answer any of yours. You can find\u00a0real reviews here.\n\n\nWhy were you diagnosed so late?\n\nI was diagnosed late because Asperger's syndrome wasn't classified as a disability until the late 1980's by which time I had developed chameleon like coping mechanisms. Getting my diagnosis was one of the most life enhancing things that has ever happened to me as at long last I understood why I felt alien from the majority of people I came into contact with, and why I struggle with things that seem to come effortlessly to them like behaving in socially appropriate ways seemingly without effort. It is nice to be able to act as a role model for my son who is also an Aspie and my husband has benefited from my diagnosis because he understands that we really are totally different and we get along very well because of, or in spite of, our differences\n\nFulfilling and rewarding lives is\u00a0the Government\u2019s first ever strategy for adults with autism in England (the consultation\u00a0ends Oct 22nd)\u00a0 What are your thoughts on the actions for improving access to diagnosis and post-diagnostic support for adults?\n\nI worry that once again the higher functioning autistic people are going to get forgotten about. There is a need for sheltered accommodation for those of us when we first move out of our parents homes and need to make a slower transition to fully independent living. Because we can come across as coping so well (we are chameleon people after all) it can be mistakenly thought that as we are holding down jobs, paying our bills able to cook clean and so on so then we can move out on our own safely. Wrong. One of the major things about autism is that there is a social developmental delay. So I was able to do all that I just mentioned and ended up moving thousands of miles away in Canada to work in a town called Banff. i was a hard worker, fairly good with money but so very socially vulnerable. At 18 I had the social etiquette and awareness of a much younger person and got led astray into a lot of things that a more socially mature person wouldn't have. Even now I am still very socially vulnerable but as I am in my 40's I think the gap has narrowed and therefore I am less at risk of being led astray. I have also learned that I am vulnerable and try to avoid putting myself into situations where I could get into trouble. I try to go out only with people who know me well so I can double check things with them. For example I can;t easily interpret people's reactions and can mistake surprise for anger and vice versa. With friends nearby I can judge by their reactions as to how I should behave in response to the situation. Though I am apt to say exactly what I think just like a small child and there isn't much they can do to stop me doing that....Life does get interesting with me around apparently. Sorry, I seem to have gone off at a tangent there...\n\nThe other thing I would say about the consultation document is that it needs to address the fact that high functioning people like me actually may not be functioning all that well under our chameleon colours. Sometimes we desperately need access to counselling and other coping strategies but because we hold down jobs, maintain relationships and so on - it can often be thought that we are coping well when in actuality we are struggling so much to keep it all together that we can't stop long enough to ask for help. Sort of like when you see a person drowning in water and they don't shout for help because they are too busy frantically trying to keep from going under.\n\nI use writing to help me make sense out of the chaos of everyday functioning in a predominantly NT world but I still cry more mornings than not at the thought of having to go out and be at work all day, still fret over making socially unacceptable mistakes that will cost me my job. So even though I am very grateful to have a full time job with which to pay my bills, I dream of being able to write full time in the predictable comfort and safety of my home.\n\nWithout Alice is full of emotion and tangled lies which shows an understanding of others emotions and imagination. Your Aspie - you\u2019re not supposed to be able to do this!!! \n\nTo be able to survive in a predominantly neurotypical world I have had to make a lifetime\u2019s work of studying communication in all its forms. I find it fascinating how easy it is to misunderstand what another person means and the major events that can occur because of a simple misunderstanding or through lack of communication. I have learned how to function in socially acceptable ways, enough that I am able to work full time, but maintaining a neurotypical facade will always be the equivalent for me as a mainstream person watching a play in a language they learnt\u2019 secondary to their first language. So, yes, the play can be understood but only after the words have been translated into the main language first. So the delay is always there and some of the subtleties of the social interaction are missed along the way, meaning it\u2019s not as rich and fulfilling for those involved as it might be otherwise. But I am able to understand other\u2019s emotions if I make the effort (though it is easier to write them into a novel that I can write in segments than to do it in real life), and I have always had a good imagination!\n\nI understand you are also dyslexic - aren't dyslexic people supposed to 'hate' reading and writing?!!! \n\nI\u2019ve always loved writing, right from the moment that I realised that it was one way of expressing to others how different I knew I was. I began writing stories when I was very young and it has always been a good way for me to work through events that I find confusing or to try and explain why I reacted or behaved in a way that neurotypical people considered inappropriate. However, being dyslexic (you think they\u2019d call it something easier to spell) means that I make a lot of typos and spelling errors, so to be sure my novel was in the best shape possible I paid to have it professionally edited before I submitted it to my publisher. I knew that I had to be confident about my novel if I was going to be able to sell myself as an author who has multiple disabilities, none of which would fit the stereotype of good idiosyncrasies for an author to have.\n\nHow do you juggle a full time job, being a loving wife, mother and writing?\nI didn\u2019t know autistic people could do these things!!! \n\nWell I\u2019m actually dyspraxic too so I\u2019m not very good at juggling. I can just about throw one ball up in the air and manage to catch it, without hurting myself or someone nearby, in the process. Lots of mums nowadays have to work, raise a family and fit their hobbies in where they can. Just like with neurotypical people, autistic people are all individuals and there is a huge variance in what we can or cannot do. I work full time because I have to in order to ensure that I can pay my share of our bills. I remind myself (sometimes on an hourly basis) that doing so means that we can afford our house with its heavy duty insulation, nice open plan rooms and garden, where I can escape from the sensory overload that comes from living in a predominantly neurotypical world, instead of having to live in a council flat where I wouldn\u2019t be able to. I\u2019m very lucky to have a supportive (though sometimes baffled) husband who accepts that sometimes the lightest touch or noise can make me twitch. I also have a son who is autistic and I want to set an example for him that autistic people can manage to function in a neurotypical world to varying degrees with the right effort and the right support and that, most importantly, that being a success in the neurotypical world won\u2019t deprive us of our autism.\n\n\nYou can find out more about Denyse at her blog, Twitter and Face book \n'Without Alice' will be\u00a0available to order from all good bookshops from October 4th 2010. However, you don\u2019t have to wait till October, 'Without Alice' is now available to order direct from Punked Books\n\nI\u2019d like to leave you with this one hint; if someone ever tells you that they are autistic please don\u2019t tell them that you are surprised by this revelation, it makes a mockery of all their efforts to maintain their neurotypical facade. Not that I have issues about this or anything. Ahem....*gets off soapbox*\n'Without Alice' is the beginning of my own personal campaign to raise autism awareness and acceptance. Thank you so much for reading this everyone and I do hope you read and enjoy 'Without Alice'.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://djkirkby.blogspot.com/2008/01/party-time.html", "http://djkirkby.blogspot.com/p/from-zaftig-to-aspie.html", "http://djkirkby.blogspot.com/p/without-alice-test-page.html", "http://djkirkby.blogspot.com/p/events.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/TG1Wryap4II/AAAAAAAADxo/qLvFdcyLyYc/s1600/Denyse.jpg", "http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_118058", "http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_118058", "http://djkirkby.blogspot.com/", "http://twitter.com/djkirkby", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Without-Alice-by-DJ-Kirkby/124731407561123", "http://authortrek.com/punked-books/2010/04/24/without-alice/"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2010/08/without-alice.html", "title": "\nWithout Alice\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, 10 October 2010", "body": "\n\nC turned 22 recently. C in the same week was taken to Diddlyland by staff.What image does this project to the\u00a0public - to C? That it\u2019s ok to treat adults as kids?Was there any thought or consideration for C's intrinsic value as an adult, as an individual?\n\nWas there\u00a0respect for C as a person first and not just as a set of behaviours. C\u2019s Autism/learning disability does not alter his essential worth.\n\nI fought for years for C to have the best education, support, therapies etc so he could achieve social inclusion in the adult world. Not this. Again. Contradicts everything I believe in, fought for, raised awareness for and worked towards with C.\n\nC may very well have enjoyed this as he likes trains. But it doesn\u2019t take much to be creative and find something more appropriate rather than maybe assuming C doesn\u2019t know any better as he doesn\u2019t speak and you can\u2019t measure his IQ. The noises he makes may sound like babble but this does not mean you should babyfy him as he is communicating with himself and his environment and gives value to who C is. \n\nWe should be enriching and opening up Cs world, expanding his experience supporting him to grow and not stagnating him in perpetual childhood. \n\nHow can C grow in self confidence if low expectations are projected on to him?\n\nTo me this is staff demonstrating \u2018Theory of mind.\u2019 They are not understanding or relating to C. Imposing what they think from what they have always done.\n\nA photo paints a thousand words. What does it say to you?\nSome comments from various walks of my life:\n\nAs a parent of a young autistic child I find this frightening for my son\u2019s future.\n\nYou must be livid. If anyone did that to my child I would hang draw and quarter them.\n\nYou should be grateful for what you get and not rock the boat. The staff are doing their best.\n\n\nMy daughter still likes to play with childish toys. I am weaning her off these to more sensory adult things. There are plenty about these days. But that is behind closed doors. I feel very strongly what we need to say to the public and staff.\n\n\nIn this day and age there is simply NO EXCUSE for reinforcing the public's stereotypical view of autistic people as lesser citizens in this way, and whichever so-called 'carers' were involved in this fiasco are fortunate they weren't exposing MY son to public ridicule like this.\n\nAs a refrigerator mum - you shouldnt care!!!\n\nWhere is the dignity and respect that our people with LD deserve? They are not adult children...this type of activity is taking us back to the dark days of Institutional care.... and that is part of the problem..... we don't want 'Care'...\u00a0 we want\u00a0 acceptance\u00a0 and meaningful\u00a0 lives for our people. They need respect and support to enable them not childish activities that only give a picture of pity to anyone observing them in this type of environment. They are PEOPLE FIRST and last.... the staff need more \u00a0training...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 this is totally unacceptable..... C is an Adult.....\u00a0 his rights to be treated as such have been negligent.\u00a0 The staff should be ashamed of themselves! \n\nI thought the CQC changed its regs to include dignity. Are the staff not trained? \n\n\nSorry I had to laugh. From Normalization\u00a0to\u00a0Personalization and Right to control to Diddlyland!!\n\n\nEducation staff and care staff\u00a0have a very different mindset. Staff are the only barriers. \n\n\nIllustrates well the Social Model of disability.\n\nI am a young man with autism and I felt really disgusted when I saw the pictures of C on the Diddly Land train. He is obviously much too old to be on a ride like that as it is intended for young children. I felt very sorry for him\u00a0as he\u00a0was most probably being laughed at. He has the same human rights as anybody else and nobody else would be humiliated like this at the age of 22. I hope that me writing this will make sure this doesn't happen to someone else.\n\nThis is baby sitting. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wmVJl3A0om8/TKxV2pEYXfI/AAAAAAAADzU/HPOaWKR291o/s1600/Howold3.jpg", "http://archive.theargus.co.uk/2006/3/29/209335.html", "http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/452379/how_to_avoid_treating_adults_with_learning.html?cat=71", "http://www.peoplefirstltd.com/", "http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/hd/news/628202.standard-iq-test-may-undervalue-people-with-autism.htm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind", "http://www.autism-watch.org/causes/rm.shtml", "http://www.cqc.org.uk/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(people_with_disabilities)", "http://www.mencap.org.uk/page.asp?id=1482", "http://www.odi.gov.uk/working/faq.php", "http://ddsg.org.uk/taxi/social-model.html"], "link": "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2010/10/diddlyland.html", "title": "\n'Diddlyland'\n"}
