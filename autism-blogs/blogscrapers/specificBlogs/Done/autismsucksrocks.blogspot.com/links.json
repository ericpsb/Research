{"date": "Tuesday, January 8, 2013", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Flikr creative Commons- Puuikibeach\n\nWe are on school holidays here in Australia so I thought I would\nsit and write a reflection on Individual planning meetings.\u00a0 I know this blog has many readers who are\nparents of secondary age children who have gone through the IEP process.\u00a0 Therefore I've put together a\nlist of items to consider and discuss.\u00a0\nHopefully this will empower you when you attend your next planning\nmeeting.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m a special education coordinator at a college here in\nSydney and also an advocate for inclusive education.\u00a0 I thought I would write this post about\ngetting it right in the Individual Education Plan (IEP) meeting.\u00a0 I see the IEP as a plan for the year\nahead.\u00a0 I like to use the Engineer/Architect\nanalogy when describing my approach to the IEP process.\u00a0 The Architect has the technical knowledge of\nthe systems and the workers. He/ she will know what will work within the\nsystem.\u00a0 Like all professions you can\nsometimes get ridged Architects (special Ed coordinators) who can only work\nthrough one model and you can find remarkable Architects who can create a\nharmony between the clients (parents, students and school) and the fruition of\nthe plan.\u00a0 Therefore I find I get the\nbest results from parents who come to the table prepared with a clear set of goals\nand willingness to problem solve and discuss strategies.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt is crucial that this plan is in place, especially in a\nsecondary school where students may have up to nine teachers.\u00a0 I find having to deal with so many teachers\u2019\nexpectations, systems and styles causes considerable stress and issue for\nstudents with Autism.\n\u00a0 \n\nI find most parents of students with autism are excellent\nadvocates for their children and are an excellent resource for strategies.\u00a0 For example they know exactly what the best\nblockers are for managing their child\u2019s stress; they know exactly what things\nwill trigger anxieties and what things will inspire their children.\u00a0 In an ideal situation the conversations are\nopen and look to coordinate the best possible strategies to support the\nstudent.\u00a0 In some cases however parents\ncome up against that ridged architect (Special Ed administrator) and the IEP\nprocess becomes a dictation of what the school has to offer.\u00a0 Therefore here is a list of considerations\nyou should raise within an IEP meeting to enable you to be a better advocate.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat\ntargets do we want to achieve this year? It is important that a set of\ntargets or goals is developed. \u00a0This will\nenable you to measure progress even if it is very small.\u00a0 A goal may be as simple as saying \u2018good\nmorning\u2019 to the homeroom teacher to as complex as self-managing anxiety through\na behaviour strategy.\u00a0\n\n\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat support\nis going to be provided?\u00a0 It is\nalways important that the student has someone who they can use as a go to should\nthey feel anxious.\u00a0 Will there be in\nclass support?\u00a0 What classes are going to\nbe supported and what classes are not?\u00a0 When\nexploring support it is important the student be consulted.\u00a0 Thrusting close support upon a student is not\nalways the best approach.\n\n\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat\nhappens when things go wrong? What safety mechanisms are in place when\nissues arise?\u00a0 Does the school have a quite\n\u2018safe\u2019 place for the student to go to during break times or when they cannot\ncope.\u00a0 What happens when the student has\na meltdown or refuses to come to school?\u00a0\nThe plan is never set in stone and should always be open to change if\nthings are not working.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWho do I\ncontact when things go wrong?\u00a0 I find\nthat in many cases students with autism will bottle up much anxiety and will\nwait until the get home to \u2018explode\u2019.\u00a0 A\ncall from a parent will sometimes be the only indication that something has\ngone wrong.\u00a0 It is important the you have\na school contact who is available and willing to listen.\u00a0 A classic example I can think of is a call I had\nthis year that averted a meltdown when a parent called to tell me her son had\nforgotten his apron for cooking.\u00a0 I was\nable to catch the boy in the morning and give him one to borrow.\u00a0\n\n\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHow and\nwhat information is disseminated to teachers?\u00a0 This is important as there is nothing worse\nthan going to a parent teacher consultation to have teachers surprised that the\nstudent they had in their class had Asperger.\u00a0\nThankfully this is rare but unfortunately I\u2019ve known it to happen.\u00a0 It is also important all teachers are using the same strategies and understand the student.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat\ncurriculum strategies are going to be put into place to support the student?\u00a0 I have a problem at the moment with a number\nof the students with autism who also have an intellectual disability.\u00a0 The students love coming to school and the parents\nare so happy with the placement as it is caring and supporting pastorally but academically\nit does not meet the needs of the student. \u00a0Whilst as a parent you will not be familiar\nwith the curriculum it is important to ensure the curriculum sets high\nexpectations and students are not left sitting at the back of the class.\u00a0\n\n\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHow are outside\nagencies incorporated into the program?\u00a0 It\nis common for outside agencies such as psychologists, Occupational therapists, counsellors,\nSpeech Therapists to be present at the meeting.\u00a0\nIt is worthwhile exploring how these are connected to the school.\u00a0 If the support is external it is worth ensuring\nthe school has a relationship with the outside support to reinforce or support strategies.\u00a0\n\n\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat\nother programs are going to be put in place:\u00a0 social skills groups, anxiety management\ngroups, travel training, school to work transition programs.\u00a0 It is important that these are explored\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sure there are other points that are discussed but this\nis a good start.\u00a0 As you can see the\nmeeting can take some time especially if a number of teachers and specialists\nare involved.\u00a0 I\u2019ve only been on the\nteacher side of the table so I cannot speak for parents so any additional advice\non what works would be a great resource.\n\n\n\nI also write a blog called Australian Inclusive Education it seeks to explore research and strategies for promoting Inclusive Education. \n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EmsAEWi1dhQ/UOy70_lHoeI/AAAAAAAAAUM/PiGNZZkaXOo/s1600/puuikibeach.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XMFRBgEkZNI/UOy8evLj9LI/AAAAAAAAAUU/thg6EgfbvWk/s1600/untitled.png", "http://inclusiveducation.blogspot.com.au/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2013/01/issues-and-questions-to-ask-when-you-go.html", "title": "Issues and questions to discuss when you go to your next IEP meeting"},
{"date": "Friday, May 6, 2011", "body": "\n\n\nIt clicked today. Not that it hasn't before. There have been huge steps, then a step back, then forward, then two steps back. That's autism for you.\n\nBut today, the pieces fell into place. She's been struggling to learn to read for a while now. Lately, she's been working even harder on her speech homework and reading simple books. Fat cat. Hot dog. She's read Dick and Jane, and recently discovered that Poppy, our Newfoundland, is the perfect reading buddy. She's become more interested in books, and loves to be read to (though she has loved that for a while).\n\nToday, we sat, waiting for my band class to start. I brought along the book I'd been reading aloud. In it, a group of teenage girls learned to read for the first time. The main character, a smaller girl who felt young and unimportant compared to her peers (hm, sound familiar?) was teaching her older sister to read. On a whim, I pointed to a word.\n\n\"I bet you know this word.\" She recognized it as one of her sight words. \"She.\" She knew the next word as well. \"Would.\" Carefully, she sounded out the rest of the words in the sentence. I helped her sound out the harder words, ecstatic. Later that afternoon, she read an entire page out of the book, with help.\n\nWe ended up going to the bookstore that evening. I don't think I'll ever forget the look on her face as she looked at the chapter books and realized that she could read the words inside. Suddenly, it wasn't something that her peers could do that she couldn't. It wasn't something to be afraid of, or pretend she didn't want to do. She could read. She skipped back to the car with her book, and once home, ran around the house singing \"I can read!\" She wanted to read everything: labels on packages, words from the book, even a birthday card that was on my nightstand. She read me an entire book, Leo the Late Bloomer, about a tiger who couldn't read or write when everyone else could. It was all I could do not to cry. She said later that there were words everywhere and now she could read them. She jumped up and down, still singing, and went to read to Poppy.\n\nWhen she came back in, she chattered rapidly about anything and everything: the characters in the book, how she felt left out with her friends, how she had friends who moved and others who weren't friends anymore, how she wanted to be like me (yeah, I know. No pressure) and how she was so excited she could read. I wished I could hug her and tell her it would be okay, that it wouldn't be hard. All I could do was hug her and tell her I knew exactly how she felt, how even now I didn't feel like my peers (Prom? Meh. Dating? Triple meh.) It surprised me, definitely. She's very quiet and doesn't usually talk about her feelings, let alone deep, dark fears and insecurities. I wish I had the words to make it better. All I can do is be there for her, ready with hugs and a listening ear (since it would probably be frowned upon to try to knock some sense into nine and ten year old girls). Even with everything she told me, I feel like she has a newfound confidence. As we told her, a whole world has been opened up to her. Later, finishing the book, we ran across yet another thing she could relate to.\n\n\"I keep thinking about a tale my nurse used to read me about a bird whose wings are pinned to the ground. Have you heard it? In the end, when he finally frees himself, he flies so high he becomes a star. My nurse said the story was about how we all have something that keeps us down.\"\n\nToday it clicked. And I know it's just the beginning and it doesn't mean everything is perfect, but I'm finally seeing my baby sister fly and I think it's the best feeling in the world.\n\nJBug is the oldest daughter of Tina, and big sister to two (mostly wonderful) siblings. \nPhoto via Flickr, quote via Princess Academy by Shannon Hale\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3270/2391233863_77c3a6195a_m.jpg", "http://www.sendchocolatenow.com", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/dajing/2391233863/", "http://www.squeetus.com/stage/books_academy.html"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2011/05/it-clicked-today.html", "title": "It Clicked"},

{"date": "Tuesday, August 23, 2011", "body": "\n\r\nI had \u201cThe Talk\u201d with my son. We both survived, barely. He is twelve now, and I know what you\u2019re thinking: WHY are you just now having this discussion with him? Do you live under a rock? Don\u2019t you know what kids are capable of getting into these days? Do you want your kid to be a statistic?\r\n\r\nBelieve me, I get it. But you have to understand\u2026I have tried to have The Talk with my son before this, many times. Each time, he politely rebuffed me.\r\n\r\nMy son has High-Functioning Autism. It is as the name implies. Some professionals call it Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. It means he has trouble with social cues, reading body language, some processing problems as well as trouble controlling his impulses, like anger. He is easily embarrased, so it didn\u2019t surprise me that he did not want to discuss his burgeoning sexuality with his mother. This is the kid who hides his eyes if I take him with me to mall and we happen to pass the lingerie store. There have been no shortage of attempts on my part to usher him into the ways of the world. He always swore he was not interested.\r\n\r\nSo when I found that he had been googling, \u201cpenis\u201d and \u201cbreasts\u201d I figured, protest though he may, it was time. I am a smart woman. I have safe search on, so he didn\u2019t find anything except Wikipedia pages\u2026no trauma. I get that kids, boys in particular, can be curious. I am just thankful that no damage was done! And I am also grateful that I have enough technical savvy to know how to lock down the computers!\r\n\r\nSo, how do you talk with your son about something you both find highly embarrassing without losing your mind? The answer, it seems, is just do it. Do not make a big deal about it.\r\n\r\nFive Ways to Discuss The Subject Without Wanting to Run and Hide\r\n\r\n1. Be as matter-of-fact as you can. Lay out the information without a lot of emotion, as though you were tutoring someone who speaks a different language. We are talking autism here. That is, after all, what you are doing.\r\n\r\n2. Refrain from idioms, editorializing, and heavy opinion. All of these will be ignored by a kid with autism. He probably won\u2019t get most of them, anyway. It is easy to get \u201con a roll\u201d and end up losing the kid halfway through the process.\r\n\r\n3. Don\u2019t bother asking, \u201cDo you understand?\u201d He probably won\u2019t admit it either way. Just lay out the information as best you can. If you are good at reading your child, you can elaborate if need be.\r\n\r\n4. This is a good time to explain society\u2019s views on women, respect, pornography\u2026just try to do it without making the kid feel belittled. Did I like that my son googled body parts? NO. Did I tell him I don\u2019t want him to do it anymore? YES. Did I make him feel like a bad person? Absolutely not. Kids need guidance, and that\u2019s what I gave him.\r\n\r\n5. Refrain from what I call \u201cAesoping\u201d even though it is very satisfying as a parent. This is basically when you say, \u201cI told you so!\u201d Kids learn from their experiences. You can certainly point out the learning, but don\u2019t rub their nose in it. That only serves to make you feel bigger than he is. One-upping a child doesn\u2019t make us better, it makes us bullies. And with a kid with autism, it makes him shut down.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea. I\u2019m no Pollyanna. It\u2019s not all roses and sunshine around here. I was floored when I found out my son had been \u2026exploring google. It wasn\u2019t easy. But instead of making it about me, and my parenting, and what I am doing right or wrong, I made it about my son. Having a child going through puberty is difficult. I can only hope I have set the groundwork for my son, and that if he does have questions later he can ask instead of looking in all the wrong places for answers.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it was a painless process for us both. But I have to admit: I am very glad that I only have one son! Somehow, talking to the girls is just so much easier.\r\n\r\nTina has two children on the Spectrum and one who is a quirky teen.

{"date": "Monday, March 14, 2011", "body": "\nIt is easy to list the things that really suck about autism.\n\nEven parents who have no experience caring for disabled children could guess the types of things I would put at the top of the list -- if they tried, for just a moment, to picture their own children struggling with an illness or disability.\n\nThey would wonder what it must be like to worry about the future and to grieve the inability to communicate with my son. They would try to imagine what it must be like to bury dreams and replace those dreams with uncertainties that literally can drive a parent mad.\n\nBut here is one of the worst things about autism -- and similar disabilities -- that only the veteran special-needs-parents will \"get.\"\n\nAfter autism slaps you around and kicks you in the ribs -- by forcing you to deal with the reality of what is \"wrong\" with your child -- it then does something even more painful.\n\nIt puts a mirror in your path.\n\nA great big mirror. \n\nAnd in that mirror, you see not only the mistakes you make as a parent -- mistakes you are destined to repeat, even as you hate yourself for doing so -- but you also see the demons within yourself.\n\nYou see how much you grieve for yourself, as a parent and as an individual, even though it is your child who has really gotten the raw deal in life. \n\nScore one in the selfishness department. \n\nYou see how you get so bogged down in the day-to-day of coping that you never manage to do the things you would like to do -- for your disabled child, for your other child, for your other loved ones, for yourself.\n\nScore one in the unorganized, underachieving departments. \n\nYou see how much you wish things had been different. You look away from soccer fields and talent shows. You shut out the conversations of parents at events for your \"other\" child -- where nobody knows what it is like to wish that your son could just be \"normal.\" \n\nScore one in the jealousy and pity-party departments. \n\nYou see how sometimes you actually are angry at your child, even though it is the autism -- and not the child -- that drives the anger. \n\nYou feel your frustration rising when he stims -- because you wish he'd be doing anything, ANYTHING, else -- as long as it was something normal. (And, yep, I am not even going to put the word in quotes because, let's face it, I love him as he is but still wish he could just be normal, whatever the heck that means.)\n\nYou lose your temper when he strikes out at you, even though you know that if the tables were turned, and you were the one completely unable to talk, you would not face the world with one-tenth his energy and joy.\n\nScore one in the bad-parent-who-loses-her-temper-and-does-not-deal-with-her-son's-disability-with-the-kind-of-patience-a-good-mom-would-have department. \n\nThe autism mirror never goes away and, man, does it shine a bright light on all your warts.\n\nNo matter where you turn, your mirror goes with you.\n\nI sometimes feel like I can hardly function after I look in my mirror. I despise myself for everything I have not done, and for everything I cannot do. \n\nBut I know I am not the only one. And even though I cannot always see the parents walking with me step-for-step, they are out there. \n\nA dad whose blog I just discovered tells it like it is:\n\nUnlike the tales that Hollywood likes to tell, there are no saints or sinners when it comes to raising an atypical child.

There have been times when either one of us wanted to strangle him. (Luckily for him it's never both of us at the same time). Handicapped children aren't intrinsically wonderful, beautiful, or even very much fun to be around. They're love-sponges that soak up all the love you can give them.

{"date": "Friday, September 16, 2011", "body": "\nA dear friend of mine asked me to post this for her as she felt unable to risk posting it herself. Can any of you relate? Can you help? Or even just comment to let her know someone else in this crazy world we live in, gets it.\n\n\n\n\nImage from visualizeus\n\n\nI recently saw John Elder Robison (author of \u2018Look me in the Eyes\u2019 and \u2018Be Different\u2019) speak. He was brilliant and inspiring. At the end of the discussion they had a question time and there was a lady in the front row who asked, \u201cI am a wife of someone with Aspergers and my question to you is how does your wife stay married to you?\u201d\u00a0 \n\nThis sounds incredibly shocking doesn\u2019t it? And for a moment I gasped and then I realised that John took no offence to\u00a0it what so ever. In fact he answered that she did not stay married to him, but he found another wife who did. He answered that for their marriage (the second and current marriage) his wife has a high emotional capacity where his is low and he has the high logic capacity and hers is not as high, so they are a good match. Also that she does not expect things of him that he cannot give, she knows his limitations and they have open communication, she doesn\u2019t get cross at him for things that he \u2018should\u2019 know. He expressed regret that he couldn\u2019t help this lady more in his answer and mentioned that he is asked that question often from women all over the world. \n\nI sat there all inspired about how awesome Aspergers is and thought to myself, \u201cyep, that\u2019s so true. Don\u2019t expect things, you need to be specific and ask for them\u201d. Feeling all smug I drove home. \n\nI have a son who was diagnosed with Aspergers nearly 3 years ago... he is 8 now. My husband as a child was diagnosed with ADD but since receiving my sons diagnosis we have figured that perhaps that was wrong and we strongly suspect that he too has Aspergers. I think that the best way to describe the ways in which his ASD (or ADD officially) affect him is that he expects things to be done \u2018his\u2019 way. He thinks something and says something and expects that instantly you will understand and agree. There is no grey area, if I have not heard properly or the question is not said explicitly enough for me to understand and I ask for clarification I am met with exasperation! Things are meant to be done a certain way, to do them other ways is met with great frustration. \n\nRules... not written in stone nor a poster on the wall but rules written in the fabric of his life which we need to comply with. Internal focus, incredibly intrinsic focus. I will stand and listen to a discussion for 10 minutes about something in particular that has happened or of interest...then I start talking and at times he just walks off, or he interrupts or changes the subject. So I stopped talking. Then I am in the wrong for I do not share, I do not discuss things with him. \n\nQuestions are asked in statements which come across at times incredibly harshly.\u201dDidn\u2019t you get milk today?\u201d instead of \u201cDid you get milk?\u201d When I point out the different ways these two sentences make me feel I am questioned as to what the difference is? Why should he ask if I got milk when it is obvious I didn\u2019t because there isn\u2019t any there! My thought to that is (it used to be the answer but then the argument following and exasperation at my not understanding his logic and point of view is not worth the time) \u2018why even make the statement then if you can see that there is no milk!\u2019\n\nHis mother is from the old school of doing absolutely everything for her family. Everything. I admire the loveliness of her home and the way in which she brought them up securely and comfortably with beautiful food on the table each night. I do not admire the fact that her son had developed a preconceived notion that that is the way things should be done for him for the rest of his life (a notion which she told me I had an obligation to do for her son... we haven\u2019t talked much since that day). We married young and despite my voicing the fact that I did not grow up in a house where the woman did everything and therefore would expect him to do things around the house etc, my words obviously fell on deaf ears. Or did not fit his preconceived rules about the role of a wife and mother. \n\nStanding in the kitchen he will say, \u201cjust look at this place! It is such a bloody mess!\u201d and then he will turn on his heels and walk out of the room. His plate has in the last year been transported from the table to the bench after dinner (after much nagging to change the before behaviour of simply leaving it there and walking away). I could push and nag to get dishes done, but more times than not the banging and crashing of the plates and cutlery as he does it either smashes one (and it is never his doing, always a cause of the dish or the way I had stacked them) as he expresses his disgust at doing them in much the same way my 6 year old expresses his disgust at packing up his toys! It is not worth the hassle.\n\nThe world owes him much. I owe him much and it is my job to make sure that all of our worlds just keep on flowing and ebbing along nice and smoothly. I do all the sports runs and therapy and school runs... I also work. Anything to do with the kids... I do. I am not bitter about this, I love my kids more than anything else and would do anything for them. I love my husband too... but I am not sure how much longer I can be all of their alls. \n\nYou see I am diagnosed with depression and have recently had an increase in my meds which has caused a decrease in my coping skills! Clearly there is something in me reacting to them and I am seeing my therapist to discuss it today, hopefully if I change meds I will regain some control... control... which has at times over the last few weeks been completely void in my life. I cannot cope with the day to day. I get through the things that need to be done and then am too exhausted to deal with the things that should be done and well need to be done but if no one is coming over then they can wait. \n\nDishes, washing, sweeping, vacuuming... housework. \n\nMy husband knows of my depression and downward spiral and yet other than trying very hard to regulate himself so that he doesn\u2019t say too many negative things to me he has done little else. \n\nThis morning I went to pay for my daughters swimming program through school. The note had been lost under the car seat and we had not paid the deposit for it. She cannot go as a result of this, it is too late. I got to the car and drove off past the school before the tears began to fall. By the time I pulled in the driveway at home I was sobbing. My toddler asked me if I needed to wipe my face and I answered \"yes I do honey.\" My friend is coming here in about an hour and a half to watch my toddler as I go to the therapist and my house is a complete disgrace. I stood at the bench, barely seeing through my tears and feeling like a complete and utter failure and the thought popped into my head...\n\nWho picks up the slack for me when my world is completely falling apart?\n\nThat smug version of me, agreeing with John Elder Robison that day and the advice he gave to the wife of a husband with Aspergers, is currently living somewhere else. \nRight here, right now I am her best friend, her carbon copy and I am wondering... how do I keep doing this? How do I keep taking the constant negativity, managing meltdowns from all the children and my partner, always trying to do and be everything because it is easier doing that than putting up with the arguments or discussions about it? To leave him feels like a betrayal as he cannot help the way he behaves... but then I think of the therapy I am doing with our son and wonder why it is that he is unwilling to try? If his son can then why can\u2019t he? But to leave feels just as hard as to stay. \n\nAre you married to someone with Aspergers? Are you that lady on that day wondering, how do I stay married in this situation? Do you understand?\n\n\n on behalf of a friend.\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iWeSkBkq1x0/TnPI_QRNLxI/AAAAAAAACkA/1IUBfJLLgtM/s1600/broken+woman.jpg", "http://www.mylivesignature.com/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2011/09/who-picks-up-slack-for-me.html", "title": "Who Picks up the Slack for Me?"},

His compassion for his brother has been amazing, as has his tolerance. Until now.\n\nThis morning we are rushing to an emergency psych consultation for my second son. Not my first born Aspie, but my youngest... the one that was meant to be easier, happier, less troubled. We are having a tough time lately, my Mum is very sick, our business has suffered and teetered on the brink of closure due to the financial crisis, my oldest is hitting puberty, and I, myself, am experiencing the start of menopause. Whilst the family has been tested\u00a0I can honestly say the love has not wavered. But maybe the attention has.\n\n\n\n\nHe is angry, seriously angry. Boiling over at the most minute things, hairbreath temper trigger. He is threatening to kill himself, and others. He tried to impale a ruler into his larynx a school, he makes threatening gestures to his friends, and at a birthday party this last weekend he told them all he was going to buy a gun and kill them all... and himself.\n\nThe really scary part is that he takes no ownership of this anger, these threats. It is always someone else's fault for not doing what he wants, for causing his reaction. We are at a loss, the school is concerned and powerless, friends shake their heads in disbelief. \n\nI am pinning my hopes on this professional man and his history of helping my sons. If he cannot then I do not know where to turn, or what to do. I am scared.

{"date": "Tuesday, February 15, 2011", "body": "\nWe walked into the paedeatricians office that first time and sat down to discuss our son. The school had told us, \"we don't acknowledge the school psychologists assessment of Aspergers as true until he also sees a Paed for an official diagnoses\". 'How odd' we thought, but finally we had found one. He looked over the tests, he asked some questions, he diagnosed him there and then.\n\nAspergers Syndrome. \n\n\"Has anyone else in the family been diagnosed?\" the Paed asked.\n\n\n\"Pardon?\", we replied still gobsmacked by the affirmative of a minute ago and puzzled as to this new question presented to us.\n\n\n\"Does anyone in the family have Autism or Aspergers? is there a family history?\"\n\n\n\"Um, no...not that we know of. Not diagnosed\" we replied, puzzled as to where this was going.\n\n\n\"No-one with any strange characteristics etc?\" the Paed continued.\n\n\n\"nope, not that we can think of\" we replied as the conversation then turned in another direction.\n\n\nThat was over a year ago. A small, non-consequential part of a larger conversation that should have been lost in the fuzzy parts on the edge of my memories as being useless knowledge to keep but instead lodged itself there in the 'important things to remember' part of my brain.\n\n\nAs the year progressed, as I learnt more about Aspergers and how to help my son that one little memory would continue to pop up over and over again. Is it heriditary? I don't believe so. Is it likely that someone else has Aspergers in the family? it is a probable possibility.\n\n\nWho?\n\n\nDay to day life is so hectic that I find chasing after my children and dealing with my Aspie sons therapies that my life is full to the brim. Perhaps I don't spend enough attention, perhaps I missed all the signs, but then there was one family member who began to jump up and sit in the chair right next to that little question posed in my memory oh so long ago as a definite possibility of having Aspergers too.\n\n\nWe talked about it, we thought about maybe getting an official diagnoses, something which has not occured, something which I cannot push on that person. As my sons therapies go on, as my patience wears thinner, I find my tolerance wears even thinner!\n\n\nThe puzzle pieces they began to click together and I wonder. Can you say that someone has Aspergers even if they do not have a diagnosis? is it real only when you have that piece of paper that says it's so? I know this is something that has been debated over a long time by others before me and within the Autism community.\n\n\nThis other person, there is no doubt has Aspergers. He has the same traits as my son. He believes everything that happens is because of or a result of something he has done. He is incredibly intrinsical and has many of the traits. He is a living, breathing, bigger version of my son, almost a direct carbon copy. His story is not mine to tell.\n\n\nWhy even mention it then? because I am struggling to cope with all that is coming at me from both ends of the spectrum here right now. Spending hundreds on therapies for my son of which he works hard at, only to see that the bigger one continues to display those behaviours we are attempting to change in my son, with no care to change them himself. As that bigger one is someone my son upholds as an idol, I am fighting a battle to prove just why he needs to change those behaviours himself. Being spoken to with a voice of contempt and disgust when things are not going the way they deem it to be, tag teaming their times to do this, one after the other. Angry outbursts, expletives thrown out at several intervals when frustrations brew over, when they don't know how to handle or what to do with their emotions.\n\n\nI am their safe place, their island on which to stand and let it all out because they believe that it is only with me they can do this. That I get it, that I wont leave them if they do. They put their mask on 'out there' and they conform 'out there' but on my island they don't need to. I can handle one....but two is often too much. I am human, it is breaking me.\n\n\nSo what do I do? how can I help someone who doesn't believe they need it, but so desperately wants life to continue the way it always has despite the fact that it just cannot? How? how? how? Yes, right here where I am...Aspergers can definitely definitely SUCK! :(\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2011/02/undiagnosed-aspie-one.html", "title": "The undiagnosed Aspie one...."},

He has started to talk about them a\n lot. I know that he is jealous of their relationship.\u00a0 Since he has no \nedit button, he also made that clear to both of them.\u00a0 Still, they \ngenerously let them hang out with their crowd at school. \n\nLast night as the evening was winding down, instinctively I decided to \ntake a peek at what he was doing on\u00a0 facebook.\u00a0 I found a chat log going.\u00a0 Some dude was telling \"K\" to back off from \"M\" and her \nboyfriend's relationship.\u00a0 \"K\" responded by ripping this guy a new one with every expletive he could think of.

Especially when others around you aren't talking like that.\n\n\nI've read in Ross Green, Ph.D.'s book \"The Explosive Child\"\u00a0 which basically says, for \nchildren with Aspergers, cursing is like barking when you step on a dogs tale.\u00a0 They're hurt or upset and they feel there is no other way \nto let you know just how much.\u00a0 It's like an exclamation point for them.\n And of course since \"K\" lacks perspective, he doesn't think about how \noffensive it is to others who don't use that kind of language.\u00a0 Believe \nit or not, none of the kids on the chat responded or used one iota of \nfowl language. \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\nIt was really getting out of hand so I had to step into his room and as gently as possible said to him,\n \"Son -I think you should really rethink the kind of language you're \nusing on facebook.\u00a0 I noticed that even though some of the boys are \nbeing rude, not one of them is using that kind of language.

I'm not apologizing to that jerk!\"\n\"Yeah...well\n I understand how you feel, you may be making yourself bad.\"\n\\\nHe didn't agree to apologize.\u00a0 I left the room.\u00a0 Soon after he posted:\n\n\"I'm deleting my facebook account.\u00a0 I can't be friends with anyone. This is not a joke.\u00a0 I'm not coming back. And I'm never coming back to school either.\u00a0 I'm just going to juvenille hall. This will be the last time you see me.\"\n\nThat was the sympathy card.\u00a0 It worked...there were 14 replies -all of them positive.\u00a0 Here are just a few:\n\u00a0 \n\"Dude what's wrong? Don't talk be talking about yourself like that! If you ever need someone to talk to...text me anytime before 10:30.\u00a0 Then I have to turn my phone off.\" \n\"I'm here for you buddy!\" (from a female...a cheerleader no less).\n\n\"Dude...don't worry about a girlfriend.\u00a0 If you really want one, just be friends with them.\u00a0 Almost every relationship starts by being friends. And if you EVER need someone to talk to I've got your \nback! Just get your schoolwork done, and let everything fall into place.\n God has a plan for evryone! Let his light shine through you.\"\n\"Don't delete it!\"\n\"I'm here for ya!\" (from another cheerleader!)\nI was so excited, I couldn't help myself...I chimed in, \"Wow! You are so blessed to have friends with such good advice!\"\u00a0 Three people \"liked\" my comment. \n\nReading these posts brought tears to my eyes.\u00a0 I could just see God all over that page and in the hearts of those young people.\u00a0 I knew at that moment that God has not forgotten us.\u00a0 He is answering my prayers.\n\nWhen I go in to kiss him goodnight I say, \"Dude! do you know how blessed you are?! You have some real friends out there who really care about you.\u00a0 Can you try to focus on them? I mean, you've got cheerleaders who are in your corner!\u00a0 That puts you in a great place!

{"date": "Thursday, May 6, 2010", "body": "\nLast week, over on my personal blog, I wrote a post about assessments. About how I'm not going to let it get to me this time. About how I know that assessments only matter to the ones who are doing them, and that I'm going to be all zen, and barely even look at the results. They are a necessary part of getting access to services and that I know what my son is capable of, no matter what some standardized test says. Heck - I should want him test even further behind so we'll qualify for more!  Okay, I didn't actually say that last part, but I'm pretty sure I was thinking it when I wrote that post. Then Friday happened.Moe is aging out of our Early Start services, so he's been having exit assessments from the Regional Center and entrance assessments by the school district who will take over. On Friday, one of the psychologists from the RC came to observe him during one of his therapy sessions. Our ABA program director accompanied her. So the poor kid is going about his business with four adults staring at him. And of course he doesn't want to do much of anything. At one point, the psychologist - we'll call her Jennifer because that was her name - looks at me and says \"Does he have any words?\" Like she's never seen an autistic kid before. So she watches for a few more minutes, makes some comment along the lines of \"Well, I've seen enough\" and leaves. I felt like he, and I, had just failed some test.Then, our program director pulls me aside and wants to warn me before our upcoming exit meeting that Moe's scores on the social/cognitive part of his assessment have gone down. I probably could have handled that, except I had just heard the same thing from his speech therapist the day before. We had our explanations: we started with a different baseline, understand more of where he really is right now, blah blah blah. But what I was really thinking was, \"So what have we been doing the last year?\" What has all the struggling and crying (mostly me), hiding in the closet (mostly Moe), 6 hours a day of people in and out of my house, putting my dog on Prozac, and me never getting out of the house been for? According to the tests, nothing. Less than nothing.After lunch, I brought Moe to his school district entrance assessment. They had already met with my husband and I and asked us all the same questions we've answered 17 times but I still never really know the answers to. (Does he understand it is dangerous to run in the street? I don't know, I've never let him try. It this is a trick question?) This time, I just dropped him off for an hour. When I picked him up the school psychologist told me that they couldn't get through the whole thing and that I would have to bring him back again this week. And I'm not sure why, but that was the last straw. I lost it. Not right there in front of the school secretary and the six year old looking for a band-aid, but later, once the kids were finally in bed and I could get in the shower and safely hide from anyone who might suggest I need an assessment myself.Jen also writes at her personal blog, Anybody Want a Peanut, and at the Silicon Valley Moms Blog.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://wantapeanut.blogspot.com/2010/04/ladies-and-gentlemen-it-assessment-time.html", "http://wantapeanut.blogspot.com/", "http://svmoms.com/jen/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/05/apparently-i-wasn-as-okay-as-i-said-i.html", "title": "Apparently I wasn't as okay as I said I was"},

I can always tell when my son gets in there because I hear things fall and clatter to the floor. I can hear the tape being ripped off the roll like it's being strangled, and the cupboard door slams open and shut probably three times. Very hard. Not in anger, but for lack of finesse. I know I will walk down to a royal mess like pens missing caps, papers spilled all over the floor, and paper clips dumped from the box. \n\nToday, though, I don't mind.\n\nMy son is making me a card for Mother's Day and I don't care about that mess. Other messes demand more attention, care, and love.\n\nYou see, we've had a tough week together. Every conversation was tense and strained, each outing turned into an argument, and every action got slapped with dash of impatience, a pinch of anger, and cups of frustration. \n\nBy the weekend, the pain eased and we said our apologies to one another. I admitted the autism was kicking my ass and he readily said the autism was kicking his ass. We were in loving agreement. However, he said he wanted to tell me more in his card. \n\nSo, he slid the card under the bedroom door. It was simple and sweet, but one part was rather odd. It read, \"Mom, sorry I was such a gark. Huh? \n\nI tried re-reading it and sure enough, it was written clearly: gark. So, when I quietly strode into my son's room to thank him and hug him, I had to ask what a gark was (while praying it wasn't some new-fangled slang that was dirty or vulgar). \n\nHe looked at me funny and said, \"I dunno, what's a gark?\" \n\n\"Well, it's what you wrote,\" I said and I showed him the card. \n\nHe laughed and said, \"No, no, no. That's the word jerk. So much for spelling!\" \n\nIt was one of those small moments, that a Gritty mother warrior and her Gritty warrior son, had a feeling of brevity and lightness. \n\nMy dear boy, sorry I was such a gark, too. \n\nOnward and upward to those Gritty Tacomans and all the other Grittys out there!\n\nKim Thompson likes to get gritty HERE on her blog! \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_3XZh4yWgpUM/S-c8i3Sq-vI/AAAAAAAAAS4/94-4iE4xyog/s1600/grittyshirt.JPG", "http://grittycitywoman.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/05/mom-sorry-i-was-such-gark.html", "title": "Mom, Sorry I Was Such a Gark"},

Dinner is over, dessert has been eaten and we need to agree to the last show. Sounds easy right? Sometimes its blissful.  Little Brother says \"I want to watch (insert Backyardigans, Sponge Bob or Crashbox here) and Big Brother happily agrees...other nights, not so much. Fighting ensues mom breaks up said fighting through compromise, computer, distraction... or insert bad parenting decision here.\n\nStep two, 7pm - Bath time. Frankly, to be honest, I LOVE bath time. No TV. I have the kids hostage. They tell me about their day, we laugh, make jokes. Its great. EXCEPT when they are fighting about the water temperature, or who gets to sit by the water, or which one gets their hair washed first. I used to pick which child went through the water torture first, but they hated that. I decided to that I would let fate control this choice, so I started playing the number game \"Pick a number between 1 and 10\" and whoever was closest would get to pick if they were first or second. But I found that I would cheat! I would think of the number after they had guessed in an attempt to alternate children....this failed miserably.\n\nSo tonight my wonderful, thoughtful older son, Big Brother (BB) just offered to go first! Mommy loves him so much, sometimes he is so giving and rational and well, just wonderful.\n\nThen story time- 7:30. Story time can also be wonderful.  My boys are great. They think outside of the box. Today we read a Little Critter book about going to the museum and then they proceeded to design their museum, for your information the Planetarium will be upstairs...their is no other option according to BB. Then we sing songs- they make me dance and they improvise sounds in between the verses.\n\n8pm Hugs, Kisses, Goodnight....or NOT\n\nPost bedtime activities\n\nBB- \"Mother don't you know I stay up for HOURS!\"\nand he is right, he does stay up for hours. First, with LB still awake, we go potty (again) get water (again)\n\nThe scariest words I get to hear from BB- \"Mother, You don't need to tuck me back in. I can do it myself\" uh-oh TROUBLE\n\nSo I check upstairs...and this is literally 3 minutes since I left the room. BB \"Look, we are building a temple\" and he is, complete with buildings, dinosaurs, dragons and other toys that have resided in the toy closet, untouched, for months. \"Please  don't take it down....Your not mad are you?\"\n\n\"No, not mad, just go to bed\"\n\nMinutes go by, I hear doors creaking, cabinet doors slamming, I go back upstairs...BB says to LB \"See, you made mother come back up\" oh yeah, I have to mention this here. Where did this mother thing come from? I was Mom or mommy up until a few weeks ago- then Mother, Mother, Mother. I asked why and BB said- \"Your my mother\" Logical yes, but I wish I still got to be mommy.\n\nSo where are we now...8:33 and things are quite...maybe.. Last night when I took out the garbage and 10pm I came back in to find a screaming BB asking where I had gone...so how long does he stay up?\n\n\"Mother don't you know I stay up for HOURS!\"\n\nSo I am Eile, I have just started blogging here and at my new blog Going Down Laughing. I am a single mom with two boys, a 7 year old Aspie and a 4 year old child that thinks he knows everything.  We laugh a lot in my house, and I hope that my writing gets funnier with time. \n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://goingdownlaughing.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2008/07/830pm.html", "title": "8:30pm"},

So, I would like to encourage you:\nDon't Feed the Trolls.

What he said was savage.  And he will say worse, he always does.  But don't fight him.\nInstead, target his advertisers.  Get him off the air.

{"date": "Saturday, June 28, 2008", "body": "\nI haven't know for very long that my son has Asperger's. I always knew in my heart that there was something\u00a0inherently\u00a0different about him. From the day he was born he was more intense, more demanding, and nothing that I thought I knew about parenting applied to him.\u00a0\nNot that I knew anything about parenting. I was a 28 year old married woman, who had tried unsuccessfully for a very long time to bring home a baby. Finally, with him I was bringing that long desired baby home with my husband, and amid the fatigue, pain, and joy there was sheer and resounding terror. What on earth was I supposed to do with this little person? What if I screwed him up? What if I broke him?\u00a0\nI managed to learn all that you learn in those first few years. Through the meltdowns, tantrums, hysterics and head beating on concrete, I pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I was raising some sort of spoiled homicidal maniac. When we were asked to leave co-op preschool because he was having trouble submitting to the environment and other kids, (I think that the teacher secretly drugged those other kids to get them to be SO GOOD) I knew that it wasn't just my parenting.\u00a0\nWe\u00a0visited\u00a0the doctor and I discussed all of the problems with behavior, and the obsessions which are above and beyond what is normal for any person, and where I was at emotionally handling this all. He confirmed that it probably was a form on Autism and that we needed to see a neurologist to confirm it all.\u00a0\nAfter getting that diagnosis I analyzed everything. Had I missed something? Was I overlooking something? What did I not see? The truth was that Asperger's really isn't that obvious, and until we had the concrete pile of evidence we couldn't look back and compile it all together.\u00a0\nNow here we are almost in July, of the following year, and he is doing better. I still deal with complete and total meltdowns over things that seem absolutely absurd to outsiders. People that don't understand Autism or Asperger's always seem to comment about how he is \"fine\" or looks \"normal\" little do they realize that it isn't a disease that you can't see. \u00a0\nI know that he will never be a \"neuro-typical\" child. I also know that he is brilliant, funny and amazingly tuned into things that most children don't have a clue about. Are there days that I would trade that because we are amid what seems like a never ending stream of chaos and insanity? I sometimes think that I would, but the truth of the matter is that I wouldn't. I wouldn't trade a single second of this chaotic madness that is my life for anything.\nTo read more about my CRAZY life, thoughts and views on Asperger's, Coffee, Anxiety and more head over to my blog Momma's Tantrum.

{"date": "Tuesday, July 1, 2008", "body": "\nI was standing in line at the grocery store, waiting to pay for the basket full of groceries I had amassed on my once a month grocery stock-up. I hate grocery shopping, especially with kids, but I had procrastinated too long and the bread had molded and we were out of milk. My children were trying valiantly to hold it together; it was late in the afternoon and had been a long day.  Grocery shopping is a break from the Routine that basically rules our lives, so often there is a difficulty in this endeavor.  But today the children were on their best behavior.  They were helping put groceries on the conveyor belt, while JBean kept up a steady stream of chatter. Today it wasn't them, it was me.  My head was throbbing: I needed caffeine and I needed quiet.My son decided to chat up the person behind us: \"Do you like Mario Kart?\"  The person mumbled something politely, too quietly for me to hear. JBear took this as an invitation and continued, \"I have Mario Kart for the DS. I  also have a Wii.  Do you have a Wii?  I like playing boxing. I am good at boxing.\"  I glanced back and the woman he was talking to seemed ok with her verbose companion, if a bit noncommittal.  My son continued: \"Did you see the Indiana Jones movie? I did, it was good.  They have the Lego game of Indiana Jones for the Wii coming out next month. I want that. Lego also makes a Star Wars game for the DS. They are making one for the Wii, but it's not out yet...\"  Again, I glanced back and saw the woman shuffling her feet, looking around nervously.  Time to reign him in.  \"JBear, shh! Come help me with the groceries.\" He didn't hear me.  I had to call him three times. Then he started asking for gum at the checkout counter. And a yo yo. Pleeeeease?  He has this trip-switch, when he has something on his mind, when he wants something, he just keeps asking. I don't even know if he realizes he does it.   About that time, the lady got that look.  Oh, you don't know the look?  Simple.When people notice something is a bit different with your kids, they react in one of two ways.  The first group widens their eyes in amazement and says, \"Boy, you sure have your hands full!\" And yes, yes, I do.  But it is what it is.  I don't have an \"S\" embroidered underneath my t-shirt.  I am just a mom, dealing with what I have been given. I don't want praise and I don't want pity.  But often,  they look at me as though I stepped from a space ship, a complete alien entity.  If I throw the homeschool aspect in to the conversation, I see the door slam shut, the eyes cloud over, and I can almost hear the voice in their head as they thank the Lord that they don't have kids like mine, and thank goodness it isn't contagious!The other group I encounter widens their eyes in surprise and says, \"But they seem so normal.\"  This is actually frustrating.  This is the reaction I get when I try to explain Asperger's.  I know that on the spectrum of special needs, Asperger's is considered pretty low.  And my kids are actually mildly affected.  Their behaviors are more annoying or frustrating than dangerous.  My son has not eloped from a classroom since the First Grade.  Of course, it helps that he has been homeschooled since the Second Grade, I suppose.He does have an anger and frustration problem.  In fact, when he is angry, he could give a salty dawg a run for his grog.  He has recently decided that it is really cool to respond to any insult, real or imagined, \"I know you are!\"  You can imagine how productive that is!  He is in the habit of cornering people, because he is a social guy.  He wants to interact, and find interesting things in common, but he doesn't pick up the cues when someone has had enough. I am constantly playing watch dog for him, translating so they will not miss out on what he has to offer, worried that people won't like him.  Or worse maybe, they will judge me because of who he is. I am not in the habit of explaining myself to random strangers, but I must be lacking.   When I do try to explain to someone who inevitably asks, \"What's Asperger's,\" I can sometimes hear, \"Well, all kids do THAT.\"  And yes, that's true.  All kids do prattle on about minutiae.  All kids have terrible table manners.  All kids get mad and frustrated and yell.  All kids don't know how to figure out when you have had enough of them.  All kids interrupt.  All kids wear the same clothes, every day, even if they are dirty, and get ticked off if told they can't wear that shirt again until it is washed. All kids harp over and over again about allowance, video games they want, going to the library...whatever it is that is on their mind at that very moment.  All kids throw fits when they don't get their way.  All kids need help getting dressed, even when they can actually accomplish this task themselves. All kids have unreasonable fears and cannot take out the garbage at night or get up to go to the bathroom in a darkened room.  But the point here, is mine do it more.  That's what Asperger's and High-Functioning Autism looks like.   I didn't want bragging rights.  I am not trying to one-up anyone else.  I am simply trying to live with kids who have to live with \"mild-mannered Autism.\" Anyone who uses this term clearly has never lived with nor experienced autism.I don't play the Label Game. I don't have Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. I don't find my identity in being Supermom or having kids with \"special needs.\"     We sought a diagnosis for my son simply because he wasn't functioning in school very well, and we started seeing some signs at home. I  knew something was wrong.  I wrote a letter to the school, asking for an evaluation.  The district did their tests, gave us their result, and then we obtained our own private evaluation. We ended up with a diagnosis and an IEP.  With some interventions and by educating myself, we found accommodations that worked for him.  I learned how to talk to him, how to calm him down, how to provide a sensory diet and just learn to live with the quirkiness that can be autism.  At some point, I started rolling with the flow, and it became, if not easy, something familiar. And, it was okay. I thought that was the end. Autism had touched us, but it was a tentative touch.Cut to 2006.  Those who read will know this already, but we had a house fire, and lost everything. The house was standing, but they gutted it, and rebuilt everything but the bones.  Every item except for the clothes on our backs was destroyed.  Of course, we all took it hard, but my six year old was particularly devastated. It was and is, the only home she'd ever known.   On a good day, she keeps most of her emotions to herself.  This caused her to retreat inside herself.  She would build little worlds with her My Little Ponies, and Littlest Pet Shop,  barricade herself inside the toy houses. Walls of toys would sit between her and the rest of us; she was shutting us out.  We sought counseling, and of course, the question we all had was, is it the trauma or is she also on the Spectrum as well?  After what we thought was a failed bout of counseling, it proved to be the catalyst and we decided to have our little JBean evaluated for autism.  I went back and forth, second-guessing myself.  Autism is a spectrum, and there is a saying, \"If you've seen one kid with Asperger's, you've seen one kid with Asperger's.  My son and daughter are as different as night and day.  I would look at her and think, \"No way she is on the Spectrum...she isn't like JBear.\" I waffled and tested her myself, and I wanted to be wrong.   She was diagnosed with autistic disorder in October.So when the woman behind me  gave me that look, I just smiled at her and said, \"Kids!\"  About that time, the cashier finished ringing up my groceries.  There is a time for education, and there is a time for cutting your losses and just getting the heck out of Dodge. So I'm sorry to the autism advocates,just know some days I fight the good fight. But today I pulled myself up by my bootstraps.  This wasn't the day to try and educate the public.  This was a day to take my children home with me, cuddle them close and read books while munching cookies.  This was a day to just be. I swallowed the lump in my throat that came from unshed tears. Yes, sometimes I grieve for what they don't have.  And maybe that's not what Supermom would do. As I rolled out to the car, I realized the lump in my throat wasn't just grief.

My son was diagnosed Autistic at age 2.  I thought he had a speech delay.  Imagine my surprise.\n\nI can't wait to bring my whole story to the table.  Autism affects each and every one of us on such a core level.  It effects our families and our lives.  It changes the dynamics of everything we've ever known.  Our hopes and dreams have to shift, that really is the bottom line, the bottom line that most people don't talk about.  The bottom line that I want to talk about.  When you are a little girl or boy you really don't think about what it will look like when you grow up and are raising a special needs child do you?  I know I didn't!  I do think we were given these children as a gift and they are precious souls. \n\nI am in the middle of a legal situation.  The opposing legal team has found that they seem to think it beneficial to watch every move I make on the internet (with it being a public forum) so that they can possibly use my sons disability in the most shady way possible.

Please try not to treat him like one.\n\nMy child has the same rights and should be allowed to ride in a plane, your plane, just as the gentleman snoring loudly in seat 3B is right now. Yes, I understand that he\u2019s screaming bloody murder right now. He\u2019s frightened. The pressure in the cabin is affecting his sensibilities. The people talking loudly to each other; the sounds that the plane is making are affecting him. Please don\u2019t keep stopping by and checking his seatbelt every 10 seconds. I can\u2019t help but notice that you didn\u2019t seem to care about the other screaming child in the back of the plane.\n\nOh? It\u2019s a newborn? Well, can I ask why the double standard? How is it okay for that parent to escape scrutiny, yet you keep harassing me? My child should \u201cknow better\u201d, you say? Hmmmmm. I don\u2019t think you understand.\n\nAllow me to explain. Also, allow me to clarify.\n\nJust like that newborn, my son struggles to verbalize his discomfort in social situations. His understanding of this situation in his mind is identical to that newborn back there. I have taken the time and great effort to make sure we have things to make him as comfortable as possible for the duration of this trip, but even I can\u2019t ultimately control his reactions. As his parent, I do my best, just as you strive to do, each day in your job. Sometimes I miss the mark. Trust me, it is definitely not intentional. I did not awaken this morning thinking \u201cHow can I piss off everyone my son comes in contact with?\u201d I have much bigger fish to fry.\n\nIn the not so distant past, it was customary for a passenger when booking a flight to tell the person who booked the reservation what special needs they might have, if any. This needs to start making a comeback. I am more than happy to let the staff know our situation, and if necessary, things we can do as a team to make this trip as enjoyable for everyone. It may mean enduring some moments that are not so comfortable for a period of time, but the end result might turn out to be not so bad. The best part is you have an opportunity for a learning moment to take place. We can all stand to learn something, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\n\nThe worst thing you can do is make me or my family feel like we have done something wrong or inconvenienced you in some way. On every flight (or just about) I\u2019m certain that there is a screaming child or an obnoxiously drunk adult or that one person who can\u2019t wait until the sign is turned off to move about the cabin. I don\u2019t always see a police escort waiting for them at the airline terminal, so why single me out? It\u2019s because autism is such a hot topic, isn\u2019t it? Or, is it your lack of training and understanding of the situation? Please help me to understand.\n\nMy family is not your enemy.

{"date": "Saturday, July 5, 2008", "body": "\nI am not a mom who takes this whole \"Asperger's\" thing lying down. I am not an advocate mom like some of the really great mom's I know. I need to get out there and do that. I just haven't been in the pool long enough to get in the deep end just yet. I am a mom however who does not tolerate any garbage when it comes to people dealing with my kid.\u00a0\nThe Fourth of July is one of my least favorite holidays. I know that you probably think that is all \"UN-American\" and horrible, so sue me. Seriously though, throughout my life it has proven to be crazy. If it was not spent in the ER for hives, pink eye, or some other freaky ailment that I managed to catch at a summer barbecue, something weird happened when we were out at some big fireworks display. (For example my springer spaniel ate an ENTIRE CHOCOLATE TEXAS SHEET CAKE in my grandmother's kitchen. When we got back to her house we thought that the dog was dead. She wasn't. She was in a sugar coma for three days.)\u00a0\nWith Bacon and his Asperger's the Fourth has been less than fun. When he was two he was so terrified he screamed for two weeks every time we went out side about the scary fireworks. It was SO MUCH FUN. Last year he had a great time with the other kids watching Mr. T and the other dads blow stuff up. This year sucked. There were way too many kids most of whom know that Bacon likes to watch the fireworks but doesn't like to touch them. Still these same kids kept pushing and pushing for him to touch them.\u00a0\nFinally when the neighborhood's biggest pain in the butt (She is 12, she has two pet GOATS, and knocks on everyone's doors at 9pm looking for someone to play with.) was chasing after him with a sparkler and trying to grab him I lost it and yelled at her.\u00a0\n\"EMILY! Leave him alone. He is four, he told you he is afraid of the fireworks, and if you don't stop I am going to have to ask you to go home.\"\u00a0\nShe of course ran to her dad and cried like she was 4, and her dad gave me the stink eye. \u00a0I could have cared less. She is OLD ENOUGH to know better. He is old enough to know that she should not be chasing after a little kid with FIREWORKS, especially when that kid is freaking out.\u00a0\nI am mostly frustrated because there is another boy that lives close to them that has Asperger's that they treat with kid gloves. Not that I want them to treat Bacon like that, but I also don't think that I should have to staple a sign to his forehead reading \"PLEASE TREAT ME NICELY AS I AM NOT NEURO-TYPICAL\"\u00a0\nWas it not obvious from him freaking the hell out all not? Was it not obvious when he was running in circles and smacking himself in the head? Or do people think that is normal four year old behavior? It had me freaking the hell out, and I had taken two Xanax and drank some wine!\u00a0\nHow do you handle this? What do I do? I know I can't forever bully all of the nasty kids out there. (Although technically I didn't bully that little snot.) I just don't feel like I have the right answer or any control. So now as an adult the Fourth of July still sucks, but for a whole new reason, because I can't keep my son safe or under control.\u00a0\n*My name is Faith Tantrum.

{"date": "Wednesday, July 9, 2008", "body": "\nMy eldest son is 7. He was diagnosed with Asperger's just last December, just on the cusp of his 7th birthday. We had known something was up for years but couldn't put our finger on what it was or how to cope. We bought books about ADD, ADHD, OCD, graphomotor dysfunction, even Autism and Asperger's but we didn't KNOW  until we traveled 3 hours to a specialist, not covered by any insurances, who charged $500 to actually sit with our son and figure it all out. --and then a second $500 to help us figure out what to do with the information. But he was worth every penny.\n\nIt was a relief to know the name of this thing that controlled our lives. The thing that had become so big that a question like \"What accommodations do you make for your son?\" had become unanswerable because...didn't everyone live like this? \n\nJoey got thrown out of no less than 3 preschools. He was \"removed\" from the private kindergarten that was supposed to be \"WONDERFUL\" after only 3 days. He was a \"disruption\"  because he told the teacher that the year 2006 shouldn't have smiley faces in the zeros and then insisted that she remove them. He wouldn't stand on the 7 on the carpet because he was NOT 7 years old. And he loved to turn the air conditioner on and off because he loved to control the movement of the air.\n\nTaking him out of that school was that start of a great change in his life. Two willing teachers and an IEP later, my Dino Boy is doing fairly well in an inclusion classroom. I just wish that everyone could see the brilliance  that exists in between random acts of eating things that are not food and his stimming habit of  bouncing round the room stretching his fingers in all directions.\n\nSo this was about Camp right? Dino boy and Little Man (see my other blog for that story) go to a wonderful YMCA camp. Little man loves it and Dino Boy went there for part of the summer last year too. So I was very surprised when after ONE WEEK they called me. \"Ummm, Ms. Eile, We would just you to know that we are giving you warning that Dino Boy may not be able to stay at camp this summer.\" Now what? I,single working mother am...screwed.\n\nBut we talked. Camp talked to me, I talked to ex husband. We spent the weekend talking to Dino Boy about staying with the group, not eating things that are not food, asking for help, telling people that you are frustrated instead of running into the woods, and Dino Boy got it. He really really did. And according to camp he does great, until about the time when there is 2 hours left in camp. He can't hold it in any longer. He struggles so hard to keep it together that on some days those last 2 hours cause him to overload....\n\nAnd I don't know what to do about it. I KNOW KNOW KNOW that he is doing the best he can, He loves the camp SO much. We had parents night tonight and he just gushed about every activity. But I wish I could just give him a break. A place where he can lose it and still be ok, a place where he can run and play and plan his Jurassic Camp movie and just be loved.  So next year...maybe I can find a special camp just for him and people like him...but is that the right choice? or should I just immerse him in \"normal\" teach him to swim like all the other fish?\n\nI don't have something catchy to end with...just an open question I guess. When you have a high function kid, what do you do? Should I constantly challenge him to move up or let him just coast during the summers? He gets so stressed. I just feel that its not fair but when he grows up he is going to need to deal with the outside world. Do I teach him to do that now...or wait just a bit?\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2008/07/camp-struggles.html", "title": "Camp Struggles"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 9, 2008", "body": "\nThe Hubby, Scamp and Spiff.  My fellas.This photo is one of many hundreds of photos taken over the course of a family trip. Can you spot which one of my children is Autistic? To an untrained eye, it is rather hard to tell. Both of my boys can be rather well behaved in public places, but then there are those times; the ones where Spiff starts flapping his arms or waving his bracelet around. These moments usually happen in more crowded spaces. Not long after this photo was taken, we boarded a Green Line T train in Boston full of people and he began to flap his hands wildly to calm himself in that situation. While it attracted many stares and puzzled looks, it helped him relax. It's incredibly important for him to be comfortable in any situation, and he has learned how to calm himself in just about any kind. It's been a long road, and we're still on it.The other day I was going through our family photos as I was transferring them from one computer to another. As I glanced at photo after photo of my kids, I noticed there were so many of my son in a group or family photo where he doesn't look at the camera, or is sitting just a touch away from the rest of us. Or both in the same photo. There were more than I realized. We chalk it up to one of his many quirks, and we are fine with this one and all the others. Other people might look at these photos or us when we take the photos and think he is being rude; but he is not. He might look uncomfortable and like he doesn't want to be a part of the \"moment\", but deep down inside he does. He really does.He's just being him.

{"date": "Friday, July 11, 2008", "body": "\nI've noticed a lot of bloggers lately have been writing odes to their children as it seems that many of them have summer birthdays. Their words have been very sweet and have really spoken to me. In a world in which so many children are unwanted, abused and neglected it's always nice to see that there are many that are not only loved, but genuinely cherished.\n\nBut I have to be honest....reading such pieces is always a little bittersweet for me. I can't help but notice and think about what they have and what I don't. I try not to dwell too much on what my child can't do and what his autism takes from him, but sometimes to avoid those things is to live in true denial.\n\nI have been in the position many times to speak to parents of children recently diagnosed with autism. I have also been in the position to offer support and counsel to parents who have coped with the disorder for some time. I am really in no way qualified to do either, but something about my listening skills and a background in the human services has lead me to these jobs. In those situations, many a person has heard me use the old \"children are like clay\" story. Go with me here....\n\nWhen a new baby is born, he is a lump of clean and perfect, unused clay. As the potter or parent, you can turn that lovely clay into whatever you so choose. It could become something as lovely as a glazed vase or something as dirty and unremarkable as an ash tray. As parent/potter YOU will choose how to fashion this priceless clay.\n\nWhen you have a child with a disability, you also get clay. It often even looks as good as \"typical\" or \"normal\" clay. But when you start shaping it, you realize as its parent/potter that it's not so easy to spin. It requires much more work and a much more delicate hand. You will become frustrated with the clay and sometimes even get mad that you can't work it as well as the other potters. You will even wonder sometimes if your clay can be fashioned into a vase or an ash tray or will simply remain.....clay. \n\nYou will walk out of your studio and see the other potters. They are all either thrilled with or disappointed by their clay.....it really all depends on the day. Sometimes they will get mad at their clay when it's really them that aren't treating it and spinning it right. And sometimes they will get annoyed when their clay does something really silly like falling off the wheel. They'll berate the clay and make a huge deal out of a simple accident that can be easily remedied.\n\nAnd what of us potters of the \"other\" clay? The clay that won't spin? Won't seal? Won't slip? Has dents, pocks, discoloration, pockets, etc? What do we do with our non-performing clay?\n\nWell, we'll get mad at it. Cry over it. Keep spinning it. Keep telling it we know it can. Lose patience with it. Let another more experienced potter give it a try. Cry again.\n\nHave I beaten this clay metaphor to death? I used to like to spin.....sue me.\n\nMy dedicated readers know that I don't talk a lot about Little Boy's autism. And I also don't try to use this blog for complaining, ranting or bellyaching. But I just had to use this chance to say something to all of you \"normal\" potters out there: take this clay you were given, and dammit, spin it right! You will never know how blessed/lucky/fortunate you were to have been given it.\n\nAnd when you see us other potters out there.....the ones with the \"challenged\" clay. Don't give us your sympathy. And don't give us your criticisms of advice. Just look at us and know that we're potters too. And like you, we're just trying to make a masterpiece.\n\nI am The Chick.....I'm a SAHM living Down South where I write about my life.....marriage, friends, music, activism, fads, oh.....and the life of a mom with a 6 year-old boy with autism.

Well, I don't hate tests,  I liked school. I loved college and learning and tests- well, cause I was pretty good at telling the teacher what they wanted to hear- I got A's and even became a teacher.\n\nBut now, I hate tests. I remember, vaguely, the week that Dino Boy had to take this test. He was nervous, scared even. But then they decided not to give him the test with the class. He got to take it on random days with the school counselor. He was still nervous of course but he didn't know when he was gonna take the test so he couldn't panic ahead of time. I thought this would help him.\n\nI didn't focus on the test. Just try, hell, just try to sit. That is all I care about. Please Dino Boy be happy, don't panic, mommy doesn't care what the test says, I know you are brilliant and no one in the world knows more about dinosaurs than you, just, please, BREATHE.\n\nAnd that is what I am telling myself now. Breathe. I am used to high test scores. I got them. My ADHD brother who flunked out of every class still ACED every standardized test that was put in front of him and to be frank he (Uncle Frog) is the smartest person I know.  So Dino Boys scores? He did better in math than language arts. I knew that. He hates to read. He can't scan, his sight words are just gone, I try to review and get him to read but making him sit at the table is more than half the battle. ( We are working on this and hope exists) But still on the NJ pass overall scale of 1,2,3, he got a 1 Basic. Minimal skills... some areas better than others but none were really, well, passing.\n\nLanguage arts. worse. Basic again, but this times in ways that I really don't get. I mean, he can recite a story to me tell me details days later. But he couldn't recite for a test? Was is that boring? Could he not fill in the bubble? He loves to be read to, he may not sit for it but it all gets in there....what happened?\n\nI don't know whether to cry or throw the f*c>ing test out the f*c>ing window or say that Its ok, this was pre IEP, pre summer occupational therapy, pre my Asperger's book binge, pre internet support group. Next year he will have the same teacher(not yet sure if that is good or not) , an aide, speech, in school OT, maybe out of school OT too.\n\nShould I care? Does school just want to make you bang your head against a wall--hard?\n\nThanks for Listening- Eile\n\nThe rest of this rant continues on my blog.

I have come to find over the last few years what works for me and my family, and I use those discoveries the best I can.\n\nBut why am I not vulnerable?\n\nWell, that answer has come to me in small little stops and starts lately....\n\nLike when I was standing in the kitchen of one of my favorite girlfriends in the world and burst into tears looking at her kids' drawings.\n\nOr when I've sat on the beach on various occasions this summer watching families have the time of their lives while my child is back at the house....unwilling to even come close to the shore.\n\nOr today......the ultimate in vulnerability.\n\nI was cleaning through things in my child's room as I make room for his big-boy bed and had to go through his keep-sake box.  It has everything right from the very beginning: ultrasound pics, hospital bracelet, baby blankets, teethers, bottle, cups, birthday cards, you get the idea......\n\nI went through it pretty quickly because I knew if I didn't I would get really sad.  I was only transferring all of it to a much bigger sterlite box anyway.....none of it was going anywhere.  So I sifted.  Moved it.  No attachment.  No vigor.  No tears.\n\nUntil I came across one little thing.\n\nThe sports strap from my child's first pair of glasses.\n\nMy little boy has been wearing glasses for lazy eye/farsightedness since he was 19 months old.  This strap, as tiny as it was, is what I always seem to symbolize with the beginning of knowing there was something different with my kid. \n\nAnd so I looked at it.  Held it.  Cried over it.  Actually cried for a pretty good while as I thought about the baby I had.....the baby I still have......the child he has become......will never be......all of it. \n\nWhen I was done I put the rest of the memorabilia away but kept out the sport strap and stashed it in my own nightstand.  So maybe when I feel like I need to have that moment of vulnerability I'll go there and have that. \n\nI'm not trying to be stronger than you....this is just the way I need to handle it.  I hope the other moms, the ones who think I have it 'so together' will understand. \n\nI am The Chick.....I'm a SAHM living Down South where I write about my life.....marriage, friends, music, activism, fads, oh.....and the life of a mom with a 6 year-old boy with autism.

You might run in to her at a soccer game or at a new mom's play group in the neighborhood. Her child may be able to speak and read and write and look perfectly normal most of the time. But there may be times when you notice the quirks. You may notice that the child doesn't engage and is always running off, covering her ears when a garbage truck belches by then throws a tantrum like you have never seen before. You may wonder if the mom knows that her child has Autism. You may want to reach out to her or her child.\n\nThen do. Ask her questions. Accept her and her child just the way they are.

I'm the mother of 2 children - one with Autism, and therefore that means I have nothing better to do than watch everyone elses children for hours on end without reciprocation.\n\nI know that childcare and babysitting options for an Autistic child are few and far between. Why do you think I am home every day in time for the bus and that I do not work outside of my home? It isn't because we are dripping in money and thriving on a single income... but don't I wish? The truth is  that it is because I have no place for my son to go after school or when the nurse calls me at 8:30am to tell me that he threw up or had a bathroom incident and needs to be picked up.  It is my obligation to my family and to my children, and I don't regret the fact that I am at-home though I wish it were under very different circumstances. \n\nYou see, my child has Autism so instead of being out and about I have to be home for the daily bus drop-off. I'll be home, so what does it matter if I have another child or two to chase after? After all, I have a child with Autism already so I'm used to it, and I can watch your child with Autism also and their siblings - heck, even one or two of their friends too- even if it completely disrupts my own child(ren)'s routine(s). Don't worry, they'll be fed dinner also - only the best organic fruits and veggies,  overpriced 'designer' chicken nuggets & juice.  Eat me out of house and home, go right ahead. Even if, we had made family plans and I let you know about them -  so please be back by 5pm - you can still show up at 8pm and everything will be 'ok'. And the next time you ask me because you need a favor - I won't say 'no', because I can't.\n\nWhen in the past  5 or so years since my 7 1/2 year old son got awarded his very first \"A\" - that would be Autism, did I lose the ability to stand up for myself?\n\nI spend every day standing up and fighting for my son that my own defenses have become annihilated. \n\nHi, I'm hellokittiemama and I'm a mother of 2 very special children, living at the Jersey Shore.

{"date": "Wednesday, September 3, 2008", "body": "\nWhen is a Word not just a Word?\n\n\n\nHave you said it? In a fit of pique? Or frustration? In just normal conversation? Have you referred to your children with the \"A Word?\"  Does it define who they are at that particular moment?  Dan Olmsted, over at Age of Autism has been ruffling feathers  because he believes we need to abolish the use of the word, \"autistic.\" He is on the right track.\n\n\nI have two children, as you know.  They have autism.  They are not autistic.  Why do I differentiate it in my head? Because autism is part of who they are. It does not define them.  They are more than just their disorder or disability or whatever we are calling it this week. I prefer to just call them my children.  Who have autism. Though I am not crazy about the puzzle analogy, it fits here. Not because autism is a puzzle, but because autism is a piece of the puzzle.\nDan believes that the word \"autistic\" is similar in connotation to \"retard.\" He's not far off.  It is akin to talking about the \"Short Bus\", (a slang term for the bus that transports special education students by those who wish to disparage it). It is a negative term, guffawed over lunch by kids who don't understand differences.\nAutistic is a very limiting word.  It defines the person's limitations.  Sometimes, the reputation of a word is enough...it doesn't matter what the actual definition is.  No one wants to be called ignorant.  And yet,  the definition in itself is not offensive. Autistic simply means \"of or pertaining to autism.\"  But the gestalt of the word means so much more.  Words can be used to educate, but is that necessary all of the time?  Sometimes, is it ok to just be?\nI have chosen not to refer to my children as autistic.  They may change that at any point.  It is completely up to them how they will refer to themselves.  I have talked to my son about this, and, with no coaching from me, he laughed and said exactly what I had said, \n \"Why would I want to be known by only one word? I am so much more than autistic!\"  (emphasis was his)\nI understand there is a movement in the adult world of autism to embrace the word.  Take it back, if you will.  It seems to me like the N word.  Young black men reclaimed the word, and the power that went with it, as their own.  But it's a word that is acceptable within the context of their community. (One could argue about whether or not it is an appropriate word for any group to use...)  Regardless, it doesn't cross color lines.\nThat is how I see Autistic.  It is a charged word.  An in-your-face word. A \"we're here, get used to it\", word.   And I can't make my children part of a political movement.  It is time for them to just be children.  Without limits.\nT, who imagines I've started something\n\nHow about you?

{"date": "Thursday, October 2, 2008", "body": "\n\n\nSome days you feel as though you are winning. Other days it is as though you\u2019re being bombarded from every angle and you just cant do anything right. I\u2019m on the phone to a mum informing her we have had some problems with her son kicking another student. I like to get in early and pre-empt the return call, as I know mum will be on the phone as soon as her son gets home and tells her the details. Mum understands the situation and I book her in for an interview tomorrow morning. We have come a long way together. From the days of school refusal because a student in his class didn\u2019t share the same opinion he had on a computer game. To refusing to eat anything at school because the other kids called him \u201ccheese disease\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m relatively new to the world of Autism and Asperger. When I was at University they prepared you by sending you out to a Special School Unit to get some hands on experience. They had you read scholarly article after article, written by boffins squirreled away in universities, on ways of managing students with Autism. I\u2019m sure I wrote over 30 000 words outlining how I would meet the students needs, all backed up with reference to the latest developments and theories. Something you quickly learn when you meet a child who has Autism is that they are individuals. Generalisations go out the window with many of the theories and interventions.\n\nI have come across some students who are happy to shut themselves off from everything. At lunchtime they escape, with their blazer over their head, in a book or a hand held computer game. Whilst others want to be out on the football field or hanging around the staff room talking to people. Some are very self absorbed in class and are reluctant to share. Whilst others, accidentally touch on a topic of interest and they could talk everyone's ears off.\n\nThe common factor amongst them all is their social interactions, or difficulty with. If you have a child on the AS spectrum and you\u2019re reading this then you are all too familiar that children with Asperger and to a varying degree Autism are very self- absorbed. Everything is about them, to the vexation of their peers.\n\nI find it difficult to actually define my job title at times as I do so many different things. I am Head of Year Eight and Nine and I teach History. I help run our learning support department and assist the school\u2019s Special Education Needs Coordinator. Basically I\u2019m the go between home and the teacher. Being caught in the middle is like acting out the fable about the man with his son and donkey, going to the market. You can\u2019t keep everyone happy. A line from a parent I spoke to last week sums up the issue\n\n\u201cI am all for children with Autism coming to the school, but where do you draw the line when it starts to impact on our kids. How many exceptions are our children supposed to make\u201d?\n\nThis is like saying \"I am racially tolerant but id hate for an ethnic family to move into my neighbourhood\". Start to read through the stories i post on my blog and you soon get a picture of the parents im talking about.\n\nSomething that still stumps me when dealing with Autistic students is that nothing is ever straight forward. The most notable case of late is of a student in Year Nine who has Asperger. I made reference to him in my opening paragraph. \u201cCheese Disease\u201d, the name kids called him last year, and the reason he didn\u2019t want to go to school. I was appalled at this and jumped on the students straight away. Later I hear that they called Andy this because he was bragging about the fact that he could eat his packed lunch of cheese sandwiches instead of the compulsory school dinners, which the students hate.\n\nI find that Students with Autism are often coupled with other disorders, the most common being Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). In Andy\u2019s case he will only eat cheese, Jam filled biscuits and potatoe smiley faces (of a particular brand, mum has to keep old packets in case the packaging changes). This plays havoc with his health. When I tried to explain to the Head of the Kitchen why he wasn\u2019t having school dinners, he wasn\u2019t having it, saying, \u201cwell if I was his parents I\u2019d just say eat it or have nothing\u201d. There is no arguing with these people who have such a shallow insight. I didn\u2019t bother to tell him that his mum had tried this and the result was Andy being admitted to hospital after not eating for three days.\n\n\n\nNow back to the issue of the complaining parent. Andy had been given two pet rats for his birthday and he had taken photos of them in to show his classmates. Andy persists with showing the pictures to everyone whether they want to see them or not. The next day I get a phone call from Andy\u2019s mum saying Andy is refusing to come to school. I have her bring Andy in and she tells me the kids have been teasing him. They said that they didn\u2019t like his rats. They said that he looked like his rats. They said that rats are vermin, so Andy must be vermin. I\u2019m actually surprised the Year Nines know the word vermin but this is what Andy\u2019s mum says.\n\nI attempt to get to the bottom of the story as I\u2019m shocked to hear that bullying had taken place. I\u2019m more shocked at the kids saying these things. As thankfully, bullying is quite rare at the school. I take one of the students from class and question him about the comments. He freely admits saying those things to Andy. This makes me angry. I begin to question why. It emerges that Andy constantly bragged about the rats and at every moment he had the picture out showing people. When someone said the rats were vermin this only fuelled the bragging. When someone said, \u201cput the photo away I don\u2019t like rats\u201d, this only made him get the photo out more. Eventually the comments had come from pure frustration.\n\nNow here is my problem. The names were quite hurtful and did constitute bullying. But at the same time they had come as a response to the behaviour of Andy. I called the parents of the student\u2019s at the centre of the bullying accusation and I was met with the response.\n\n\u201cMy son has an aversion towards rats so I can defend his actions\u201d.\n\nI could also see the parents and students\u2019 point of view. A Year Nine student hasn\u2019t developed the social decorum to hold back on insults when faced with frustration. Their response to the bragging was to reply with an insult. For Andy this is confusing as he doesn\u2019t see his behaviour as bragging and can\u2019t understand the response the other students have to something he sees as deeply interesting.\n\nSo here develops another problem. None of the other students want to be around Andy because he is annoying and if they say anything to him about how annoying he is they will get into trouble. Compounding this Andy knows this also. So he does not want to tell on anyone even if he thinks they are bullying.\n\n\n\nThis is just one incident this year with one student. The school I work in is in the Independent sector and draws students who would benefit from a smaller setting. Over the past two years our clientele with additional needs has grown exponentially. 90% of the students have some form of learning difficulty and approximately 20% are statemented. For those unfamiliar with the U.K. system, Statementing is a process of identifying need\u2019s and provides funding based on that need, so the students can attend mainstream schools. As you can imagine the people who hold the purse strings and give statements are tight and many parents especially the ones that are not well educated or familiar with the system miss out. This is a whole other issue and I wont get into it at this stage.\n\nIn the U.K the fazing out of special schools has meant that SEN students are integrated and have access to the same education and opportunities as all children. Most schools have a special education coordinator and a team of classroom assistants. To give you a scale of the support we have 35 members of teaching staff and 26 learning support assistants. Many old teachers here despair at the influx of SEN students we take in, but looking at the successes we have it can\u2019t be denied that the small setting with adequate support is the way to get the best out of these kids.\n\n\nI look back over my post now before publishing and i hope it does not offend. I hope parents can see the dilemma when faced with integration. \n\nMy next post here will be about a boy I'm trying to help who says inappropriate comments all the time. Help with this one will be much appreciated. so stay tuned.\n\n\nMatt writes a regular blog of his own about his teaching at Trials In The Life of a Teacher. Feel free to make comments and offer him advice. On the same hand if you need advice on education and Autism feel free to drop him a line. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s1glPfQ564U/SOUDwFPhbVI/AAAAAAAAAEs/LbY85sK9idE/s1600-h/untitled.bmp", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_s1glPfQ564U/SOUFOekzKuI/AAAAAAAAAE8/e9BDCJo4XtY/s1600-h/pet-rats-717618.jpg", "http://www.myteachingtrials.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2008/10/some-days-you-feel-as-though-you-are.html", "title": "MY FIRST POST - Autism and Education"},
{"date": "Monday, July 7, 2008", "body": "\n\"So what is the rate?\"  She inclined her head towards me. I swallowed, stalling because I didn't know.  I knew it was high. I looked at her and said, \"Not sure, but I know it is higher than the national average. That's just over 50% now.\"   So I decided to come home and google up some actual figures.  There is no question that raising a child with autism, even high-functioning autism, is a challenge.  It is a challenge financially, emotionally, spiritually and attitudinally.  It is an entire paradigm shift.  Like living with a duck who wants grapes...all the time.  It isn't hard to feel at your wits' end ..often.  Many times J comes home and I just have nothing else to give.  I am spent.  Absolutely worn out, and not able to give to one more person.  And who gets the short end of the stick?  You guessed it: J does.  And yet he rarely complains.As I write this, he has sallied-forth on a mission of mercy.  Yes, the kids are tucked into their beds, and he has gone to procure Starbucks mocha, the nectar of the gods.  He knows foreplay.  Or maybe he just knows how to keep me sane.  Since life can often be a war zone, and I, crawling over enemy lines without hesitation (okay, maybe there is a little hesitation) a medic on duty is necessary.  That's where J comes in.  I guess it works because we take care of each other.  We get along well, and well, we don't really have to work at it.  Which is good, because there isn't much time to work on much of anything in this house, not the way the littles behave. We can't take on anymore.There is a reason we have cats.   Cats are independent, don't mind if they aren't the center of attention and often prefer not to be.  We don't have a dog, though I would love one, and maybe someday soon, we may take the plunge.  But I don't have the time to devote to puppy training and walking and just being generally slobbered over and followed around.  I get that enough.  We would probably kill a fish, forgetting to feed it.  And you don't want to see my yard.  When we moved back home after the fire, we decided to do our own gardening.  But me, in my infinite wisdom decided that we would do the Green Thing and not use poison on the lawn to kill the weeds.  And, did I mention that I now use a rotary mower to save the environment?  Unfortunately, it is now my lawn that needs salvation. Lacking time, I haven't done the requisite internet search for nematodes and other magic organic fixes to protect my lawn from the weedie beasties.  Consequently, my lawn, which of course, someone forgot to water, is now brown with green things bobbing in not quite a sea of crabgrass.  We do manage to get it somewhat mowed, but it seems to be a losing battle.  The flowerbeds are overgrown, and all good intentions to clear them and plant something  gave way to a brochure left on our front stoop about code enforcement and happy neighbors.  We don't know which one of the wonderful residents of our 'hood left it for us, but there it is.And my answer?  You try mowing the lawn when you have a 6 yr old in the middle of a screaming fit for who knows the reason (sometimes, there are no reasons) and a 9 yr old being defiant and refusing to do anything except repeat, \"Can I have a cookie? Can I have a cookie? Can I have a cookie?\"  And this after being told, as I am wont to do: \"Question asked and answered,\" ad nauseum.  And amidst this, I will take time to mow the lawn?  What planet does the anal neighbor with the perfect yard and the perfect teens (only they aren't because I see them on the corner) who mows his lawn and trims his plants nearly every day...what planet is he from?So, there is little time left to work on things like marriages, or dinner reservations or breathing.   So it is a very good thing that my marriage is usually so easy.  We figure we survived a fire, when the house was completely smoked out, everything was destroyed and we had nothing but each other. We survived the insurance settlement and the rebuilding process and the redecorating and even the relocating.   Autism after that?  Cake.In any case, I came home and  found the figures.  According to a few online sources, it is over 80%.  Dr. Phil even pegged the rate at 86% if you can believe it.  86% of marriages amongst couples who have a child with autism end in divorce.  So, since we have two children, does that make our rate higher?  In fact, statistically, we aren't married at all!  Yay, we are living in sin, and have been for almost 19 years!  (Then why aren't we having more fun?)TLC feels very lucky to still be married after all this crap. She has three children, two with high-functioning autism, she homeschools and is still mostly sane. She views autism as a growth process and the opportunity to connect parents for support as a passion. Read more of her misadventures at Send Chocolate.

{"date": "Monday, September 22, 2008", "body": "\nI'm gonna do what a lot of people would never do \u2013 I'm going to be honest with my actual thoughts and not sugar coat it and say it out loud. Autism sucks. Autism sucks and I wish my kids didn't have it. Autism sucks and it's not fair; to them or to me. Autism sucks and so does the ignorant attitude of people who make unthinking idiotic comments. These are all the 'sayable' things.\n\nThe \u201cUnsayable\u201d things are harsh. Bitter, negative, unfriendly. It'll probably surprise most of the people who know me. I don't say these things out loud. People are always telling me how funny I am, what a good sense of humor I have, what a great handle I have on it all. It must be my background in role-playing games \u2013 it makes me a good actor. My current character is a super mom who is a super fighter for her kids and autism advocate, who is both mom & dad, not to mention teacher and a host of all those other things. Let me rip up the character sheet for a moment and let the harsh truth seep in...\n\nAutism sucks. It is not a gift, a challenge to be overcome at the end of the road \u2013 it is a devastation to every parent who ever heard the diagnosis, and is lifelong, unless you're one of the few who get lucky with the 'cure of the day', whether it be Secretin, ABA, Music Therapy, Hyperbaric Oxygen, GFCF diet, or the many other cures that come and go. I'm not saying these things don't help some kids \u2013 they do, and I've seen good things happen for some, but I've never personally met a child who has been completely 'recovered'; only heard of them in the news and over the internet. I've tried them all, and my kids weren't the 'lucky' ones. With every failure, one more drop of hope leaves the glass. All your plans and dreams for your child disappear. It is not simply a 'trip to Holland' that landed in China, or whatever the damn metaphor is. Most of the time it is a trip straight to Hell.\n\nSometimes I want to trade my kids in for typical ones. Many times I wish I could go back in time and do it all again and yes \u2013 change things. Most of the time I just want to quit. I feel jealous of my friends that have kids that are 'normal', or at least more typical than mine. I feel jealous of those that have husbands and family who help them. I feel jealous that if I want to tear my hair out and scream and take off, the most I can do is lock myself in the bathroom with the kids pounding on the door. I wish I would have married someone with stronger character. I feel envious of the scum of an ex-husband who took off 2 months after the boys were diagnosed, because he's never had to deal with a day of autism. Never had to deal with the Regional Center, the school districts, the various therapies, etc. Never had to use respite hours just to get things done (people actually use respite for respite?) \n\nYes, respite is used to get things done. I learned when the boys were little that many environments were so overstimulating, they just couldn't handle it. Many were the times I walked out of Wal Mart or some other place with a screaming child under each arm, shouting out, \u201cI'm not kidnapping them, they're autistic!\u201d. Now they're 12, and I can't carry one of them, let alone both, so a lot of times, we just don't go anywhere. I'm tired of the snide comments, never to my face, but as I'm walking out with the screamer, the ones that comment, \u201cSome people just don't know how to discipline their kids!\u201d. Once I actually answered the fool by saying, \u201cSince you're such an expert on childcare, perhaps you'd volunteer to babysit this Saturday night?\u201d Not to mention the time I shouted back, \u201cThey're autistic \u2013 what's your excuse?\u201d\n\nI'm envious of those who can just have a babysitter, instead of search for a caretaker/babysitter/crisis interventionist who can handle a 12 year old autistic boy's temper tantrum. I wish I had a child who I could take to a 'natural' dentist. Now that the doctor prescribed Atavan before dental visits, it only takes 2 people to hold him down so the dentist can look in his mouth \u2013 it used to take 4 people. I don't have a choice \u2013 if they have cavities, they have to use anesthesia. Hell, I have to bring a helper when we go to the doctor, because Mikey will throw himself on the floor and refuse to move, and he's too big for me to pick up.\n\nI want a child who has interests, not fixations. The higher functioning one, when he collects things, has to have every single thing in the series, or he loses it. As collecting a complete set of anything is prohibitively expensive, I discourage any type of collecting that comes along. I have not told my son about Bakugan, that new card/toy game. The thought of a whole new series to collect and the issues revolving around not having a certain item in it makes me very afraid. Speaking of fixations, I wish my other child wouldn't scream for hours when we can't find a certain book, toy, shirt, etc. And why is it that the one he wants is never the one I just happen to have seen, but one I haven't actually seen in months? The worst is when he asks for a video or book that I got rid of years ago, before I realized how bad the fixation issue was. Now I simply buy lots of big bins, and store stuff in the garage. To that end, I miss being able to get rid of stuff for good.\n\nI miss the days when I could open the windows in my house instead of having padlocks on them to keep my eloping son inside and safe. I miss opening the front door in the morning to cool off the house. I wish I could leave my son outside for the few minutes I need to use the bathroom, instead of dragging him inside with me and locking the house, just in case he decides to hop the fence and run onto the freeway like he did previously. I also miss the days when I didn't have to have locks on the kitchen cabinets to keep my son from gorging till he gets sick. I accidentally left the cream cheese container on the counter this morning while starting a load of wash, and by the time I got back, the container had been licked clean.\n\nI'm jealous of those who get to use their college degrees. I have a Masters Degree, but instead, I'm my children's caretaker, earning minimum wage through IHSS, because holding a real job where you get to be with grown ups doesn't work when you have no one else who is willing to take care of your kids. There's just not enough sick days and family leave time \u2013 I tried. I'm envious of people who get to be around other grown ups on a regular basis. I'm jealous of people who can earn enough to buy a home. We will be renters forever, as the minimum wage won't let us qualify, but also because of the fact that IHSS is constantly in jeopardy of being cut from the state budget makes my job an unstable one as well. Oh, and IHSS won't let you contribute into social security, so for the last few years,  in terms of chalking up working hours for social security, I technically have been NOT WORKING. Yeah. And so much for having a savings account, as if I keep one, the boys won't get their SSI. I will never be able to retire.\n\nI want to smack the fools who always tell me I must be doubly blessed, or that God doesn't give you any more than you can handle. I want to rip out their intestines and shout, \u201cHandle this!\u201d Same goes for the people who tell me how I should be grateful it's not worse than it is, or that the boys aren't both as bad as the lower functioning one. Side note \u2013 these people have NEVER volunteered to babysit my kids. \n\nI want to be able to take a shower when it's convenient for me, not have to sneak it in before the kids get up or after they go to bed or wait till I have respite help, because the last time I tried to shower when they were awake, I came out to the kitchen with all the eggs cracked on the floor and Mikey singing about Humpty Dumpty. I want to be able to stay up late again, and not crash at 8:30 pm, just because the kids went to bed at 8:00, and if I don't follow, I may never get sleep, because their sleep patterns are so unpredictable. I'm envious of anyone who can sleep through an entire night, without waking up after 3 or 4 hours, thinking of all the stress and horrors and the worst \u2013 what the future might hold for my kids. I'm jealous of my friends who can sleep in and tell their kids to be quiet in the morning, and the kids actually listen. I want to be able to write like this on a regular basis, but I just don't have that kind of solid alone-time on the computer (I've been writing this for months \u2013 started it right after Tina told me about this new blog). For that matter, I'm envious of all those people who have time to have their own blogs. Hell, I'm envious of those that have enough time to read other people's blogs.\n\nDon't get me wrong \u2013 there are good things; lots of things I love about my special children, but many people write about the good. I'm here to speak the unspeakable parts. I'm here to do the job nobody else wants to do, or has the guts to do. I'm the bad guy all the time in my fight \u2013 I'm the super bitch to the school district, regional center, and any other agency who is supposed to provide appropriate services for my child but doesn't, whether it be from budget or indifference. I don't care if these people like me, I don't care about establishing a 'relationship' with them \u2013 I just want them to do their frigging job \u2013 the one they get paid for, yet the one I end up doing for free.\n\nI don't want to be jealous, envious, bitter, angry, tired, hurt, exhausted, alone, ungrateful \u2013 but I am. I wish I was a better person, like the \u201cSuper Mom\u201d character I portray every day, but I'm not \u2013 at least, not under the surface. If these kinds of thoughts make me a horrible person, then so be it \u2013 but at least I'm real. If I've learned anything from my ordeal, its that I can't afford to delude myself about anything. When you start lying to yourself, that's when you really get sucked under, and that's the time when the kids really suffer, and why would I be going through all this Hell if I didn't completely and utterly love my children despite it all? But just because I'd go through Hell and back for my kids doesn't mean I have to enjoy the trip. \n\n\nBobbie is the mother of twin boys with autism, one high-functioning and one lower-functioning.

Can you ever really be prepared for that? I got to see it first hand on the field trip. Little bastards did it in front of me. Ballsy kids don't you think? Did J realize what was going on? I don't think so, but I'm not sure. What he did realize is that he was trying to be included in the play but was not being included and I'm sure he could not figure out why. Painful on levels I will never be able to express. When I addressed the issue in the parent teacher conference his teacher flipped her lid. Why didn't I come to her right away? Why?

Suck!\n\nThe neighbor kid used to jump our fence and play with my son's yard toys (swingset and sandbox). It would be one thing if he was coming over to play with my son, but he wasn't.  He never had anything nice to say about him or to him, for that matter. He'd just make comments and say \"He's wierd\", \"What's wrong with him\", \"I don't like him\". \n\nI believed for a long time this was just because he was young (about 5 or 6 at the time) and just didn't know any better.  Then, I found out he was in an inclusive classroom and around autistic kids all the time. I thought, dear god - please tell me he is not like this with the kids at school. And if he is, please let a teacher guide him. But it just kept happening. It became clear, he was just going to continue talking about my son in a rude manner right in front of him as if my son didn't even exist. Hey kid, he might not talk a lot, but he heard every word that you said.\n\nIt made me boil inside. I had enough! I got off my wimpy butt and I talked to his parents. His mother was somewhat apologetic and said she would talk to him. And still, he was mean. He would climb our fence any time we were outside (and sometimes when we weren't outside) and play in our yard. This drove me bonkers (for liability reasons and also just out of a plain lack of respect).  Finally, one day when he was half over our fence headed into our yard I told him: \"If you come in our yard and play with Alex's toys, you need to be nice to Alex and not rude.\".  The next day his parents asked me why I yelled at their son. I told them exactly what I said, and they couldn't argue with it.  Two years later, every time we go outside in our yard this kid still does the same kind of stuff.  And, because of it we don't play in our own yard nearly as much as we should.  How sad is it that my own kids can't enjoy playing in their own yard, with their own toys?\n\nWe were recently at a birthday party and a kid called my son \"stupid\" over and over and over again because of something he did that was completely innocent to him, and a part of his Autism. \n\nI've come to realize that my son has a target on his back, Autism.\nPick on me.\nEasy Target.\nA sacrificial lamb.\nand it sucks!\n\nHere's what I want to know:\n\nIs your autistic child the prey of bullies and on the receiving end of teasing by other kids?

I am also beyond blessed that our school district is so great at offering the services that he needs and has such excellent teachers for him.\u00a0\nI recently returned to work full time though, and am not as involved in his day to day (read here every single second of everything that is going on) activities. I am worried that this is going to cause all kinds of trauma and distress to him in the long run though. The guilt is sometimes horrific.\u00a0\nAlso we are still having all kinds of issues with sensory potty training issues. Part of it is attributed to age I know, but then part of me feels like this will be a never ending battle because of the Asperger's. I cannot remember the last time we went a full day without a pee or poop accident. We take away privileges, we remind him endlessly to go, and still nothing works. He is about 75% trained and has 3 months until he turns 5. I wouldn't be so worried if he wasn't going to mainstream kindergarten, where peeing your pants can turn into some kind of ridiculing nightmare.\u00a0\nHe also still won't sleep in his own bed. He starts there, but always ends up in our bed. We have tried the Super Nanny method of escorting him back to bed 7,952 times, we tried weighted blankets (which freaked him out) sticker reward charts, money, begging and nothing works. I get up at 4am so the constant up and down just doesn't really work for me because I have to sleep in order to be alert for work!\nDid I do it wrong by not getting him into OT? Did I do him a disservice by not keeping him in psychotherapy with the lady that was by the train tracks? (Trains are his thing, and every time a train went by he went crazy.) Or am I doing okay, by sort of letting him work it out on his own with school and seeing how it goes?\u00a0\nHe has made so much progress! He can have a conversation with people, he can recognize people's feelings, he can write his name! He is adding! He asks me how MY DAY WAS! Things I NEVER thought I would see...and I know that some parents of kids with Asperger's and Autism will never see.\u00a0\nI still worry that I am doing it wrong, that I am not doing enough for him.

{"date": "Sunday, December 7, 2008", "body": "\nJust a reminder that the Holidays can really suck if you have a child with autism. Sucks for them, sucks for you, sucks for everyone around. In regards to the kids, it's mostly overstimulation. Too much going on, changes in their routine, overload of gifts and people and BOOM! Meltdown City. Sometimes it just can't be helped, but try your best to make things business as usual for your kids on the spectrum. Don't let your relatives push you or your kids into a situation that will lead to even more chaos. If you have determined that your kids can only handle opening 3 gifts at a time without going into a paper tearing, package wrecking frenzy, then don't let great aunt Sally push another present on little Johnny as she says, \"Oh, it's just one more! What can it hurt? I want to see his face when he opens it!\" (side note: often little Johnny will not ever remember who gave him what, let alone remember who great aunt Sally is.) If this does happen, great aunt Sally will be the one with the weird look on her face as little Johnny opens the present, takes one look and tosses it aside, as it's not what he's currently fixated on.\n\nIt's also a very lonely time of year for us grownups. Often, even our families don't fully comprehend what autism is (heck, they don't live it 24/7). They shake their heads at the kids' outbursts, furrow their brows and look aghast at the weird behaviors, and often will request that you and your 'special' kids come late and leave early, if you're invited at all. You'd think that people would be more accommodating, as it's the kids that have the disability, yet all sorts of otherwise 'typical' adults are either so uncomfortable with your kids autism or so inflexible at having their 'good' holiday 'ruined' that they just don't want you & your non-typical mess around.\n\nI learned, after many years of trying to integrate the boys into the usual family gatherings, that it was too rough on the boys, as well as me.  Now we host Christmas Eve at my house, we invite everyone, and only ask that people let us know how many are coming, so we can have enough food and time to prep the boys. This is good for the boys, who can wander off at will and play with those things that are familiar to them. The problem with this set-up is that a lot of time, not everyone comes, or they will come late and leave early so as not to have to deal with the autism world too long. Either way, you often find yourself alone for a good chunk of the holidays, with only your autistic non-social kids to keep you company. I have no solution to this, other than to tell you to keep tabs on your friends who also have kids on the spectrum, because they're the only ones who really know what you're going through.\n\nTotal side note but also relevant - please be careful of light displays with blinking or flashing lights. These can often trigger seizures in special needs kids, and just because yours hasn't had one yet doesn't mean it's never going to happen.

{"date": "Monday, February 9, 2009", "body": "\n\n\nOver the years, I have witnessed an exodus of sorts when it comes to the education of friends' children. More and more parents of children with autism and Asperger's Syndrome are choosing to homeschool.  We are the well-kept dirty little secret that your school district doesn't want you to know: often our children can be better served at home than in the school system.\n\nI would have never said such six years ago. I was a died-in-the-wool PTA, room mom, get into the system and change it, agent. But one horrific year with my son's classroom (through no fault of the teacher) and I became a true believer.  I figured I couldn't do a worse job than the school, and I might even be an improvement. Besides, my son hated school, to the point I was literally dragging him there.  Something had to give.\n\nAnd now? I homeschool  all three of my children, and this is our 5th year.  Two have been diagnosed with high functioning autism, they are 7 and 10 respectively.  My oldest is going on 15, and though she has never been diagnosed, she has many of the deficits of Asperger's, and is also academically gifted.  Her father is a computer engineer, and is most likely also on the Spectrum. (he was never tested, but off the record, our psychologist said so)  So, you do the math...\n\nIn any case, bringing my children  home has worked out wonderfully for us.  Homeschooling has allowed me to tailor each program according to what works for each child.  My 14 yr old, who went to school for 6 years benefits from a very academic program.  She enjoys the structure and it works.  My middle guy, at 10, is the one I walk the line with.  He isn't unschooled, but his academic structure would, at first glance, seem more relaxed.  It is still very scheduled, however.  But we benefit from frequent breaks, sensory diet and multisensory approaches.  I can choose activities that he enjoys, and we keep work periods short and focused.  He can take a break for pogo stick or OT work, as needed.  My littlest one, at 7, is the one that learns best through games and Mom Time.  She needs one-on-one (as does my son) that she wouldn't get in a classroom.  She often has to be taught a concept repeatedly before she gets it.\n\nMy middle guy is also dyslexic, which makes it interesting, and I am thinking my littlest may be, as well.\n\nAs for socialization...which is a joke anyway...  but still. We have found with regular play dates, activities and park outings, my children do just fine. There is more time for preferred subjects (my 14 year old taught herself to both play the piano and knit, because she had more time than if she was traditionally schooled.) We have more time (and funds) for field trips and activities. While other kids are sitting in a classroom, mine are out learning in the world.\n\nThere is a park day we attend and have for years.   The attendance is large, with many different ages and multiple abilities.  There are several kids from all ages that are on the spectrum in varying degrees.  It is a very welcoming group.  Truly, it was the best decision we ever made for our family.\n\nWhen my son ended 1st grade, he barely read, was behind in math, his writing was still reversals (though he is left handed, so that made it worse).  I would literally dress him like a doll and drag him, kicking, to the public school.  He would sit under the teacher's desk, or make games. His aide was useless, only serving to keep him from eloping from the classroom.  His work was all sent home. I was already homeschooling, and my son was in the school system!\n\nHe is now in the 5th grade, and reads at grade level.  His math is also at grade level, or just below.  He is above in Science, History, Geography.  His writing and penmanship has improved 10 fold.  and most importantly, he loves to learn.  I have found that learning is a broad term for what we do every day.  Mythbusters is learning and exploring Science.  Going to the Arboretum is a chance to discuss the environment and botany, as well as the food chain.  In fact, every activity has inherent learning in it...you just have to find it.\n\n\nThe most important thing to remember about homeschooling?  It isn't something you do.  It's something you live.  And there really is no wrong way to do it.  You can, and your child can... and if it doesn't work, keep tweaking.  Also, what your state standards may find important, you may find doesn't mesh with  your family.  That's ok.  I have found that as we go, my kids pick up information I didn't formally teach.  And the one thing I want to equip my children with?  The ability to find information.\n\nThe freedom I have found, as well as the free time away from IEPs, discipline meetings and just general headache is now energy I can pour into helping my son love learning.  Less time is spent arguing over what the schools think he needs and more time is given to what he actually needs.  We have personalized his goals, and we make sure he reaches them.  There is no fighting with autism experts who insist my son is meeting goals that are either too broad, too easy or just plain wrong. I am in control.  And my children are the better for it.\n\nThat, to me, is success.\n\nT. is a writer, wife and mother of three children, two who have high-functioning autism, one who has undiagnosed Aspergers.

{"date": "Friday, February 6, 2009", "body": "\n\"You can just wait like everyone else\" a sour faced receptionist shot at me.  \"You mothers of Autistic kids always come in here expecting special treatment when your children are just as capable of waiting in line as any other child is.\"\n\nNo.  She. Didn't.  She didn't just go there.\n\nIt's 7:05 am at a Lab Corp facility where I need to get my daughter's blood drawn to check her med levels. The tiny, sterile waiting area is wall to wall with people, spilling out into the halls.  The wait is likely close to an hour.  My child, very severe on the autistic spectrum, does not handle crowds, cramped spaces, uncertainty, waiting, and other general realities of life very well.  As she is utterly non-verbal, she has no other way to communicate her discomfort other than behavioral meltdown.  I'm completely in a panic and feel the hundred eyes in the waiting room on me and my \"different\" child.  People shift nervously in their seats as my daughter jumps, squeals, moans, drools, hits, and otherwise does not act like a typical citizen in a typical waiting room on a typical day.  I feel like I have to apologize for being out in public. For corrupting their \"normal\" lives with the abnormality of our presence.   \n\nWhen I realize the length of the wait, the conditions of the waiting area, and my child's difficulty with such sensory overload, I start to deliberate whether or not I should ask the staff people if any accommodations can be made for my daughter.  She also has Emla Cream (a topical numbing agent) on her arms to prevent pain upon blood draw that would wear off in about 30 minutes.  Without her arms numb, she will kick, spit, bite, freak out, and become traumatized by yet another medical procedure that she has endured over her entire lifetime.   Flushed, feeling conspicuous, fragile, and anxious I go to the front desk seeking assistance, empathy, and yes, I suppose a little special treatment. What I get is the quote with which I opened this post from  \"Sally,\"  a phlebotomist manning the front desk.  \n\nIt's interesting to me that there are people in this world, although certainly few and far in between, who look upon parents of special children in this way.  That we are using our child's disability as an excuse or a rationale for a free handout, special treatment, attention, or accolade.  Unfortunately, this poisonous attitude seems to be reserved for the disabilities that are less physical and perhaps less easily understood.  When a child has ADHD, Conduct Disorder,  Intermittent Explosive Disorder, Autistic Spectrum Disorder, Tourette's, or a psychiatric diagnosis they sometimes are seen as having more control of their undesirable behavior than a child who physically appears different (as a child with Downs Syndrome, Multiple Sclerosis, etc).  Often times the implication is that it is the remiss, lax parent who cannot \"control\" their child, and not the child's disorder that is at the root of the problem.   Our society has certainly come a far way from the \"Refrigerator Mother\" theory of Autism, but at times like this, I see that not everyone is as enlightened as I might have assumed. \n\nClearly Sally felt that any special treatment my daughter would receive was undeserving.  In her words, her accusation, my daughter could \"wait like any other child.\"  No, you compassionless, ignorant shrew, that's the problem:  She CANNOT wait like any other child.  She is NOT any other child.  She is not in control of herself.  Her AUTISM is in control.  Her brain is structurally different.  She has chronic static encephalopathy, generalized seizure disorder, severe to profound cognitive impairments, sensory/nervous system deficits and Autism.  She is disabled.  She looks rather \"normal,\"  but she is disabled. My God, she eats her own sh*t for heaven's sake!  She cannot \"wait\" in this overcrowded, fluorescently lit waiting room without making everyone's life a living hell.  She is not spoiled.  She is not poorly disciplined.  She has Autism.  Ever hear of it?  She is 13 years old and she cannot dress herself, bathe herself, pee on the toilet, take care of her menses, buckle in her own seat belt, open a container, brush her hair, say \"Mommy\" or anything more than the 8 word approximations that comprise her vocabulary.  \n\nThe audacity of me to request a little special attention!  I am so sorry.  How dare I cash in on a no-wait pass at Disney or a little respite care through Division of Developmental Disabilities.  What a heinous, self-serving mother I am!  And, to expect a little help at a facility that provides patient care?  I am so used to getting my ass kissed because of my child's special needs that it certainly makes living with Autism so rewarding!  Boy I'm making out like a bandit, alright.  I get to cut in line at Lab Corp, which certainly counterbalances the fact that I also get to clean up her almost daily fecal smears, worry about her running away, spend about a million dollars to take care of her the rest of her life, and manage every aspect of her self care.  I get to stress about the severe seizure disorder that has landed her in the hospital numerous times starting at 4 months of age.  A seizure disorder that could realistically be the death of her.  Please forgive me for my selfish request.  I am not worthy.  She is not worthy.  She's only autistic after all.  She'll manage.  We'll sit and wait like everyone else, because after all, we ARE like everyone else, aren't we?!?\n\nSo, what's next Miss Sally?  Will a person confined to a wheelchair have the audacity to ask for a ramp?  Will a blind person have the presumption to ask for signs in Braille or permission to bring their seeing eye dog into the waiting room?  Last time I checked, accommodations for disabilities was the law.  Last time I checked, Autism was a disability. \n\nAutism does indeed suck, but there is one thing that sucks even more.  The attitude of Sally and others like her.  An attitude of ignorance and hurtfulness, wielded like a dagger; slashing at a wound that has already been hemorrhaging for years.   A wound only a few ever bother to see. \n\nAlicia D. is the mother of 4 young children, her eldest is diagnosed with Autism.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2009", "body": "\nToday was the third meeting with our architect as we continue the initial stages of building our dream home. Interestingly, at this meeting there was cause to disclose my eldest daughter's special needs as we discussed the functionality of our house plans for our kids. At the end of our meeting, the architect shared with us that he too has a special child. It is always amazing to see the shift in relational dynamic that occurs when two people, almost strangers, share this one bit of information. Suddenly, doors open into each others' lives and mutual understanding and empathy flow forth. \n\nAs a parent of a child with special needs I notice an unspoken camaraderie, or a \"Club\" so to speak, with other parents in similar situations. No matter what the diagnosis or functioning level of your respective children, there is that immediate bond when you hear another parent's story or see them struggling at a restaurant or store with a child that reminds you of your own. An instant understanding. A deep connection. It crosses oceans, creates bridges, connects continents, transcends dialect, race and creed. It is unspoken pain, unspoken love, unspoken relatedness. I wonder sometimes if we parents, as a result of not quite \"fitting into the norm,\" are trying to find and/or create some kind of community within the larger society. A community where we don't have to explain ourselves, where our child isn't stared at or worse - NOT stared at (you know, when people too politely avert their eyes). \n\nAs the mother of both a \"non-typical\" child and three \"typical\" children, I always have one foot in one planet and one in the other. Dual citizenship. I straddle the galaxy and it never ceases to amaze me how both close and far away these worlds are from each other. The ability to live 2 parallel lives poses challenges as well as offers great reward and a sense of balance to a once lopsided existence.  My oldest, afflicted with serious seizures at 4 months of age and diagnosed with Autism and \"Mental Retardation\" at age 2, was my only child for 10 years. For a decade I was a Mom, but didn't feel like I could relate one bit to the mothers around me. My life was filled with Physical, Occupational, Speech Therapies, private and county intervention, music therapy, neurologists, endocrinologists, cranial sacral therapy, secretin infusions, DAN protocols, visits to specialists, travel to conferences, and thousands of hours logged onto the Internet researching and on my knees in prayer. I was not on Planet Typical... the planet of regular Mommies doing regular parenting things, but rather orbiting in its atmosphere, desperate yet fearful to land. \n\nIt's interesting because I have met some of the most wonderful people in the line at Baja Fresh, in an ice cream parlor, or by visiting each other's blogs from hundreds of miles away. We have crossed paths and bonded through the gravitational pull that draws special needs parents toward each other. I think when we meet someone who travels our path, who prays our prayers, who picked up the pieces of our same shattered dreams, who rebuilt our same new dreams, who revelled in new joys, who feel our pride and rejoicing, who cry our tears, who live on our planet, we breathe a sigh of relief. The relief of not needing to explain ourselves or our child's different behavior, appearance, or needs. The relief of speaking our own language. The relief of not having to give explanations. The relief of being released from orbit, even if just for a little while, and feeling the warm soil of our Homeland.  \n\nAlicia D. has essays to be featured in the upcoming issues of Today's Caregiver and Autism Spectrum Quarterly.

{"date": "Thursday, February 12, 2009", "body": "\nI am beginning a series of interviews with parent's of special needs kids. Lets start with me. I'll conduct my own interview so all of you can get to know me and my special needs kids!\n\nQ: What is your name & how many children do you have?\n A: Jenn Brockman - 2 girls, 7 and 11  \n\nQ: You have a special needs child. What is her/his name and what is the special need or diagnosis for that child?\nA: Actually, both my girls have issues, but don't we all? Nove, the 7 year old has Autism and possibly sensory integration disorder and oppositional defiance disorder too.\nKat, my 11 year old, has ADHD. The doc said he'd never seen another kid in his practice rate so high overall on the Connor's scale. (2 of her teachers and we/parents filled out the rating form) \n\n Q: What are some of the issues you deal with on a daily basis from your child? (behavioral, physical symptoms or issues)\nA: Nove is stubborn, non communicative at times - she won't use words - often grunts, points, growls, when words would be used by anyone else. She plays with hot wheels, but play isn't a good word here. She actually just lines them up in different patterns. She is only about 75% potty trained. We still use pull ups on a regular basis. She spins, and spins and spins. There are so many other things, that it would take up a whole page all by itself. \n Kat, interrupts, can't get from one room to another without being distracted from her mission, talks loudly and often (all the time!). She wiggles and fidgets and moves all the time. Can't get organized, because she starts on one thing and gets distracted.  \n\nQ: How old was your child when they were diagnosed? If no diagnosis yet, please skip and answer next question.\n A: Both girls were diagnosed within the last year thanks to family therapy.\n\n Q: Was it easy or difficult (to get) diagnosis?\nA: Well, we've been in therapy for a year and a half and we are just now getting to diagnosis. We tried to get the school to help with Kat for the last 3 years, but they kept brushing our concerns aside until her grades failed this year. \n\nQ: How did you feel upon getting the diagnosis?\nA: It was a relief to get Nove's diagnosis. I had questioned my sanity daily because of her behaviors, but I knew she was not ordinary. For Kat, I felt relief for her. Her self confidence had failed so badly that she beat herself up both literally and figuratively daily.  \n\nQ: Do you care for the child by yourself, or do you have a support system in place? Please tell the readers about your situation. (who provides care and in what way, for what reason)\nA: Right now, the support system consists of my Mom when she feels well, their Dad on weekends (we are divorced), our family therapist and the school. My mom has been a tremendous help since Kat was born, but she gets migraines and has had a bad bout for several months now, so I feel like I'm a single mom trying to deal with these two unruly children all by myself.  \n\nQ: What obstacles (if any) did you face along the way & how did you overcome them?\nA: The main obstacle was the school. Last year we had a run in with a substitute teacher who claimed that Nove wet her pants on purpose when she was angry. Her home room teacher this year, while communicating and working well with her, may believe that Nove has bi polar disorder and so I'm not entirely sure how she is reacting to Nove. However, there have been some great bright spots along the way. The pre K teacher was the one who initially helped us determine that there was, indeed, something going on with Nove and was so very patient and kind to her and to us. This year's new special education teacher seems to be much more level headed than the previous one and is communicating well with us ( I think).  \n\nQ: Did you ever feel like it was a losing battle?\nA: Daily! Nove doesn't get up easily in the morning. She hits, she gets frustrated easily and gives up quick, which frustrated me even more. I feel doomed to be her caretaker for the rest of my life which is not something I signed up for so it feels at times like a life sentence.  \n\nQ: What quality/qualities (i.e., tenacity, discipline, time management) do you think are necessary for a mom of a special needs child.\nQ: Which ones do you think it brings out in parents of special needs children?\nA: Yep, all those listed. Patience, (which I have little of), empathy, compassion and strength.\n\nQ: What one thing (book, website, coach, therapist, drug, tool, blog, service, etc) was VERY  INSTRUMENTAL or inspirational to you?\n A: Can't pick just one! George, our family therapist. His humor has helped me get through many frustrations. I take things too seriously more often than not and he has shown me that I don't have to. Temple Grandin is inspiring. She is an adult with autism. Had it before autism was freely diagnosed and actually works and does presentations in the grown up real world.  \n\nQ: What resources do you still/currently use to help you in your care for your child?\nA: Therapy. Even though there isn't much to help Nove with in our family therapy, it keeps me sane. Keeps me from giving up and giving in to her and to the social expectancy. Twitter. I've found many other parents of special needs kids there and have been able to share and get comfort.  \n\nQ: What do you do to keep sane? (scrapbooking, running, reading, baths)\nA: I used to be a dancer. (belly danc) but the car accident ended that, so now, I read the forums and run my business. The weekends are probably the best for me. I get to spend a couple days with out the girls and with my boyfriend at his house watching crappy TV reality shows and just not giving a crap about the rest of the world. It took me a while to learn how to do that though.  \n\nQ: I met you through a business networking connection. What business are you in?\nA: I'm in direct sales, beauty and fashion.  \n\nQ: What is the name of your company and when did you start it?\nA: I own 2, along with special needs kids talk radio. My baby is Painted Laydies Mineral Makeup which I created from the ground up. I formulate, create, market, and everything else. The second is Mama Bags where I sell fun and unique handbags and accessories.  \n\nQ: What was the inspiration behind your company/business?\nA: Well, Painted Laydies began out of a need for products that didn't make my skin go crazy. I had a background in beauty and art so the color theory and creation part of making the products was easy and a lot of fun. I hoped and still do, that it will actually provide a way to make a living and still be able to care for my kids without worrying about losing a job because I have to go rescue one of them from school.\n\nQ: What is your favorite quote/movie/song?\nA:The Pricess Bride - \"as you wish\"   Some commercial - \"what the french, toast?\"  \n\nQ: What advice would you give to other moms of special needs kids?\nA: Reach out to communities and other parents. The best support comes from someone who can identify with what you are going through. I thought I was alone in what I dealt with in regard to my kids. The fact is, there are millions of us!  \n\nQ: How can my readers connect with you? (Website, Twitter, blog, etc.)\nA: I'm always looking for new stories and people to connect with on http://specialneedskidstalkradio.com\nMy other businesses can be found here; http://www.underavirgomoon.com\n Twitter name is Jenn Brockman\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://specialneedskidstalkradio.com/", "http://www.underavirgomoon.com/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2009/02/interview-with-special-needs-kids-mom.html", "title": "An Interview with a special needs kids mom - Jenn Brockman"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 22, 2009", "body": "\nAs a new author of this site, I thought I'd start by introducing myself. My name is Jeannie and my six-year-old son, Mr. Busypants, has mild autism. Below is one of my earliest blogs. I thought I'd start off on this site by sharing my story about when autism entered my life and what having a child with autism means to me.\n\nMiss Chattyshoes is interested in all things potty. The other day she stood over the toilet to say \"bye-bye\" to its flushing contents. Suddenly her nuk popped out of her cheeky little face, instantly sucked down to the point of no return. Perplexed and concerned, she pointed to the toilet and begged for \"ki-ki.\"\n\nAt this young age, Miss Chattyshoes is already declaring her independence. She does so in many ways, but the most obvious is her reaction to peer influence. One of her best buddies is M, a neighbor from across the street. M is 7 months her senior and full of words and wisdom. For example, we've been calling Miss CS's nuk a nuk for 18 months. She spends one day with M and her nuk is now a ki-ki. The same goes for her sippy cup, which was just that: a sippy cup. But M calls it a ba-ba, so now Miss CS calls it a ba-ba.\n\nWhat I knew about autism came from two sources: the movies (specifically Mercry Rising and Rain Man) and a film we watched in the 6th grade (so bizarre that I even remember this particular film) that described autism as a condition where the person was lost in his own little world and behaved like a chimpanzee. The other tidbit I knew of autism (or thought I knew) was that one day a toddler was talking and engaged and seemingly the next his social and speech skills were lost.\n\nThis was autism to me.\n\nAnd so I began working through my fear that one day my baby would wake up and be mentally, emotionally and socially gone. With me, Mr. Busypants had a boisterous laugh that filled the house. We spent hours running around our house in Lisle, circling through the kitchen, dining room and living room, hiding and seeking, stomping and giggling. With others, he was stoic and serious. When the word autism re-entered my vocabulary, fear as I had not yet known it came as well.\n\nIt took a while to work through the anguish. For me, the first step was recognizing what autism was and what it wasn't. The DSM-IV defines autism as\n\n(I)\na) impairment in social interactions marked by a lack of eye contact, facial expression and social gestures. CHECK.\n\nb) impairments in communication manifested in a delay in spoken language and (later) repetitive language and a lack of spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play. CHECK.\n\nc) restricted repetitive behavior patterns, interests and activities including preoccupation with balls and matchbox cars (CHECK), inflexible adherence to routines and rituals including but not limited to eating French toast sticks every morning two years, throwing a sippy cup and all unwanted food off the high chair tray, being hypnotized by spinning objects such as ceiling fans, and flicking objects such as door stops for extended periods of time (CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK). Stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms including head shaking, picking up every stick within a 2 mile radius at the playground, and general Monk-like behavior (think 2002 series appearing on USA about an obsessive-compulsive ex-cop who solves crimes) (CHECK).\n\nDSM-IV does NOT describe autism as:\n(a) futureless\n(b) hopeless\n(c) relationshipless\n(d) joyless\n(e) speechless\n(f) loveless\n\nIn a nutshell, the word did not change the kid.\n\nMr. Busypants is spectacular. You need only look into his eyes to see the wheels turning--the thinking process is like a roller coaster ride. Fast, intense, thrillseeking. It's all there in those bright, blue eyes. He sees things we can't. He organizes. He engages. He responds. He follows through to completion. I fall short on all of the above on a semi-regular basis.\n\nFrom the early age of 21 months, Mr. Busypants had a fascination with water. He couldn't hear me scream his name two feed away, but turn the bath tub on three houses down and he was there in a flash. Part of that fascination extended to the toilet. A week into our new Aurora house, he too \"broke\" a toilet. Though Miss Chattyshoes hovered over her daddy in the master bathroom as he diligently retrieved her invaluable nuk, I mean ki-ki, from this vital household fixture, Mr. Busypants had dad replacing the first-floor toilet after flushing a mega-block.\n\nThis kid is larger than life; he thinks big.\n\nJeannie Anderson is a stay-at-home mom with two children, Mr. Busypants, 6, and Miss Chattyshoes, almost 2. She is a part time college-level writing instructor at three Chicago-area colleges and writes about the Adventures of Mr. Busypants at Mama Busy Pants.Related articles by ZemantaIf Autism Is A Joy Why Is It In The DSM?

{"date": "Monday, March 2, 2009", "body": "\nThe following is in response to a comment made on the last post regarding homeschooling for autistic kids. It refers to a comment from a special education teacher. Go read it, first. Califmom's response needed to be its own post.\n\n\nSorry to be petty here, but if the argument to send my child to school is being put forth by a teacher who has more grammar/spelling mistakes in his comment than content, I have a difficult time swallowing that pill.\n\n\nHowever, I'm a bigger person than the product of my (formally schooled) environment. So, I'll bite.\n\n\nWhat I read in Mr. Black's comment is that my son should attend a formal, school setting in order to experience poor treatment by his age mates and failed social situations, which will then require the support of a team of professionals.\n\n\nThis scenario is seen as superior to providing my child with social experiences outside the academic setting, where stress is lower, and success is higher, which then result in positive experiences in the building blocks of his social competence.\n\n\nUnderlying all of this is an assumption by Mr. Black that I, as the parent of the child, check my opinions at the door, trust the system, and let the professionals do their job.\n\n\nMr. Black, just so you know, we were not always homeschoolers. We didn't even choose this path, initially.\n\n\nIn fact, for over 7 years, my children attended an expensive, award-winning private school that touted its ability to address special needs.\n\n\nMy personal educational background is in child development and elementary education.\n\n\nWe did not arrive at our decision to homeschool because we had some idea that it would be a great way to exclude our child from the artificial construct we currently call our schools, an institution largely existent as a remnant of the Industrial Revolution and the requirement that we produce a society of factory workers with a similar world view--followers, non-thinkers, non-questioners.\n\n\nWe arrived at this decision via a difficult path, but we are beyond pleased with the results we see in our children. More, our family and friends are impressed with the change they see in our children.\n\n\nYou see, nowhere else are we grouped in such an artificial fashion as we are in a traditional school setting. Children are grouped by age, and often ability (or disability), and then expected to derive value from this socialization.\n\n\nI have yet to find a workplace (the argument most put forth for a school-based education is to 'get a job') comprised of same-age coworkers. Have you?\n\n\nAside from prisons and psychiatric wards, nowhere else do we lock people in for the day and attempt to control their behavior. Seems odd that we expect only 1 of 3 of those scenarios to be appropriate for all members of our society.\n\n\nI want more for my child, and I have the ability to provide it. Maybe it's not what everyone can provide their child. Maybe it's not the right thing for everyone, but it is what is meeting the needs of my children and our family. It's also the beauty of living somewhere that provides us this freedom.\n\n\nIf you really want to boggle your mind, Google unschooling. That's what we do. I'm guessing it'll make your head fall off, but maybe it will just open your mind.\n\n\nBecause of her son, califmom knows more than she wants to about Asperger and Tourette Syndromes. She doesn't think autism needs to be cured. She does think that autistic spectrum disorders are more likely orders--another way of being in this world.

More and more parents of children with autism and Asperger's Syndrome are choosing to homeschool.  We are the well-kept dirty little secret that your school district doesn't want you to know: often our children can be better served at home than in the school system.\n\nI would have never said such six years ago. I was a died-in-the-wool PTA, room mom, get into the system and change it, agent. But one horrific year with my son's classroom (through no fault of the teacher) and I became a true believer.  I figured I couldn't do a worse job than the school, and I might even be an improvement. Besides, my son hated school, to the point I was literally dragging him there.  Something had to give.\n\nAnd now? I homeschool  all three of my children, and this is our 5th year.  Two have been diagnosed with high functioning autism, they are 7 and 10 respectively.  My oldest is going on 15, and though she has never been diagnosed, she has many of the deficits of Asperger's, and is also academically gifted.  Her father is a computer engineer, and is most likely also on the Spectrum. (he was never tested, but off the record, our psychologist said so)  So, you do the math...\n\nIn any case, bringing my children  home has worked out wonderfully for us.  Homeschooling has allowed me to tailor each program according to what works for each child.  My 14 yr old, who went to school for 6 years benefits from a very academic program.  She enjoys the structure and it works.  My middle guy, at 10, is the one I walk the line with.  He isn't unschooled, but his academic structure would, at first glance, seem more relaxed.  It is still very scheduled, however.  But we benefit from frequent breaks, sensory diet and multisensory approaches.  I can choose activities that he enjoys, and we keep work periods short and focused.  He can take a break for pogo stick or OT work, as needed.  My littlest one, at 7, is the one that learns best through games and Mom Time.  She needs one-on-one (as does my son) that she wouldn't get in a classroom.  She often has to be taught a concept repeatedly before she gets it.\n\nMy middle guy is also dyslexic, which makes it interesting, and I am thinking my littlest may be, as well.\n\nAs for socialization...which is a joke anyway...  but still. We have found with regular play dates, activities and park outings, my children do just fine. There is more time for preferred subjects (my 14 year old taught herself to both play the piano and knit, because she had more time than if she was traditionally schooled.) We have more time (and funds) for field trips and activities. While other kids are sitting in a classroom, mine are out learning in the world.\n\nThere is a park day we attend and have for years.   The attendance is large, with many different ages and multiple abilities.  There are several kids from all ages that are on the spectrum in varying degrees.  It is a very welcoming group.  Truly, it was the best decision we ever made for our family.\n\nWhen my son ended 1st grade, he barely read, was behind in math, his writing was still reversals (though he is left handed, so that made it worse).  I would literally dress him like a doll and drag him, kicking, to the public school.  He would sit under the teacher's desk, or make games. His aide was useless, only serving to keep him from eloping from the classroom.  His work was all sent home. I was already homeschooling, and my son was in the school system!\n\nHe is now in the 5th grade, and reads at grade level.  His math is also at grade level, or just below.  He is above in Science, History, Geography.  His writing and penmanship has improved 10 fold.  and most importantly, he loves to learn.  I have found that learning is a broad term for what we do every day.  Mythbusters is learning and exploring Science.  Going to the Arboretum is a chance to discuss the environment and botany, as well as the food chain.  In fact, every activity has inherent learning in it...you just have to find it.\n\n\nThe most important thing to remember about homeschooling?  It isn't something you do.  It's something you live.  And there really is no wrong way to do it.  You can, and your child can... and if it doesn't work, keep tweaking.  Also, what your state standards may find important, you may find doesn't mesh with  your family.  That's ok.  I have found that as we go, my kids pick up information I didn't formally teach.  And the one thing I want to equip my children with?  The ability to find information.\n\nThe freedom I have found, as well as the free time away from IEPs, discipline meetings and just general headache is now energy I can pour into helping my son love learning.  Less time is spent arguing over what the schools think he needs and more time is given to what he actually needs.  We have personalized his goals, and we make sure he reaches them.  There is no fighting with autism experts who insist my son is meeting goals that are either too broad, too easy or just plain wrong. I am in control.  And my children are the better for it.\n\nThat, to me, is success.\n\n\nT.\n\nTina Cruz is a writer, wife and mother of three children.

{"date": "Thursday, March 26, 2009", "body": "\nOn the tonight show several days ago, President Obama made a joke. A joke that he undoubtedly quickly regretted. A joke that probably did not even register on the radar of most of America. But, a joke that engendered a strong reaction from many in the Special Needs Community. \n\nI have read many posts about the President's gaff. I personally was not offended and tend to give people the benefit of the doubt when they make an honest faux pas. I do, however, respect that there are people who were offended or hurt by what he said. They are entitled to express their opinions and feelings on the issue. My personal fear, however, is that some individuals are using the President's mistake as a license to rant about Obama as a person(i.e, making assumptions about his level of sensitivity and his overall attitudes) thus diluting the REAL societal issue. The man put his foot a bit in his mouth, no question. However, I personally feel his joke was not made with malice or intent to harm. I have no issue with accepting his apology without asking him to prove to us HOW sorry he truly is. A sincere apology, for me at least, always suffices. Really, this is not an \"Obama\" issue, but a societal issue. Namely, the normalization of certain words and jokes that devalue those with cognitive/intellectual challenges. Until the people in the 'Special Olympics' and on 'the short bus' are seen as human beings with VALUE in our society, nothing really will change. \n\nMany a punch line has been made at the expense of the cognitively challenged. Derogatory language regarding differently-abled individuals has become ingrained in our culture's common vernacular. Words like 'moron' 'idiot' and 'that's retarded' are common slang as are one-liners about 'riding the short bus,' or equating someone's abilities to \"Forrest Gump.\" We scarcely give it a second thought, until someone we love is the one ON the 'short bus.' It is then that such comments take on a whole new meaning. \n\nWhen such slang or joking references are made, whether by a public figure or a friend, there are 2 roads that we can take. We can take it as an opportunity to stand on a soapbox and lecture on how and why we are offended. Or, we can create an opportunity to educate, enlighten, open dialogue and share pieces of our lives that help others empathize. To spread awareness. \n\nAwareness occurs on a grass roots level; planting seeds every where we go. Just as important as what we say is HOW we say it. Raising awareness can not truly work in harmony with finger pointing and personal judgements. We need to recognize that most people have little to no personal experience with people who have special needs. If someone comes across as lacking sensitivity to the issue, they need to be met with understanding and education, not criticism and a laundry list of how they are a horribly insensitive human being. Our first priority is to spread awareness, not moral outrage. What we are dealing with is an issue of ignorance (in the true, Webster's definition of the word) not intentional malice. And the best eradicator of ignorance is education. \n\nWe are called upon to raise awareness. Awareness is best achieved by telling our stories, one at a time, in any venue to whomever will listen. People don't want or need to be lectured. They don't want to feel like we're humorless. They don't need to feel humiliated and infantilized for their unintentional mistakes. They don't want their motives to be judged with undeserving harshness or have assumptions made about their character. So, what do we do? Ignore it? Laugh with them? Accept it? No. Spread awareness, but awareness free of negativity. Not focusing so much on why we are offended, but on humanizing the lives of those with Special Needs and the people who care for them. We plant a seed when we share, one at a time, and awareness begins to grow. \n\nLet us spend less time judging the hearts of others and more time sharing our own hearts and experiences. Free of stone throwing. Free of character assumptions. Full of love for our daughters and sons who we are defending, suppressing the urge toward righteous indignation. Raising awareness is our task. Let us do it with thought and sensitivity; choosing our words with the same care we expect from others. Let us not forget that fairness and forgiveness are two-way streets.\n\nAlicia D. has a doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology, is the stay-at-home mother of 4, and her eldest has autism and other disabling conditions.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 31, 2009", "body": "\nWhen it comes to your kids, it's easy to take credit for the good stuff.  For example, there is no denying that my son Max takes after me in the looks department.  As you can see from this photo of me as a child next to a photo of him, we share the same pale skin, eyes, nose, chin, and smile.  My husband Scott and I joke that he is such a physically robust child, he is our wee viking, a clear descendent from the Danish side of my family.  He also has a stubborn streak a mile wide, which both my husband and I can take credit for, as Max embodies everything Taurus, just like us.  But the Autism, where the hell did that come from?  In the past I have joked that my son looks like me on the outside and Scott on the inside.  Kind of mean spirited in retrospect, but my husband has a thick skin and (hopefully) knew I was kidding, sort of. \n\nI haven't found any research that conclusively proves the cause(s) of Autism.  There is certainly a genetic component though, as once you have a child with Autism, there is a one in seven chance you will have another child with the disorder.  So, whose fault is it then?  We each have some quirky family members we could point fingers at, but perhaps the apple doesn't fall that far from the tree.  What I mean to say is, maybe both my husband and I have qualities and characteristics that have created the perfect Autism cocktail. \n\nLet's start with me.  I have major sensory issues.  I am extremely sensitive to the light.  My sunglasses have to be double tinted so that I can see when it's sunny out.  I wear my sunglasses outside until the sun has set.  Florescent light makes me crazy.  This has been true my entire life.  I remember taking a drafting class in high school (anyone who went to Unionville High School will recall the huge concrete shop rooms with the high ceilings and harsh light), where I had to get permission to do my work outside of class because the lights gave me migraines.  I am constantly turning the lights off in my home, preferring natural light, and even then, the darker the better.\n\nAnd it isn't only light that is an issue for me.  I am an auditory learner, so if there is too much going on around me from a sound perspective, I lose my mind.  This is a challenge as my husband and his family are loud talkers, who carry on multiple conversations at the dinner table.  I have trained my husband to pipe down, but the rest of them aren't so well behaved.  Love them to bits but mealtime with multiple Carefoot males can be overwhelming to say the least.  I am also incapable of carrying on a conversation if there is a television on in the background, or music playing. \n\nThe list goes on.  I don't like wearing socks, wool is a no-go, as are tight clothes, and the sound of someone cutting their nails makes me climb the walls.  I am incapable of sitting still - either tapping my feet or my hands until Scott takes hold of whatever appendage of mine is flailing about and secures it. \n\nI don't want to out Scott and all of his eccentricities (seems unfair and overly critical).  I will say that he is not the most social person I have ever met.  Typically he won't pursue going out, but if someone calls him to say, watch a UFC event, he will usually  go.  I find that his default is to enjoy spending time alone, and while he can be the life of the party, this behaviour is largely manufactured so that others will enjoy his company. \n\nOur son Max shares all of my sensory issues.  He is extremely sensitive to light and sound.  He is a sensory seeker, and needs deep pressure on his legs and arms to help him self-regulate.  He often does the typical hand flapping that is common with Autistic children and rocks back and forth when he is stressed.  He doesn't seek out others to play, and largely enjoys playing on his own.  Looking at Scott and myself, it makes me think maybe we both have some Autistic tendencies.  When you add them together, it's not hard to see where Max gets it from, good looks and all.\n\nKatrina Carefoot is a working mom with two children, her son Max, almost 3, and her daughter Cameron, almost 1.

{"date": "Sunday, March 29, 2009", "body": "\nAs other parents recount the day that their child was diagnosed, or that moment in time where they understood something was wrong with their child, I am amazed at their power to recall the details of the time.\n\nI don't remember those details. Every day of my life since my youngest daughter's birth has been a blur.\n\nAs an infant, she did not have a sleep schedule. She would be awake all night, or for hours at a time and often, she was inconsolable. We tried different formulas after breastfeeding. Nothing changed. We even had our chiropractor adjust her and there was a short lived reprieve. Maybe a day or two of sleep for the household? It is hard to remember anything other than the general.\n\nI don't remember loving this baby like I did my first. Yes, every child is different and the feelings associated are different also. But, this was....... different. The sleepless nights turned quickly to resentment and frustration and depression.\n\nSoon, we were lost in our own woes and stumped about what the baby's problem was. So, we just dealt with it.\n\nBy the time she was three, my husband and I had separated. I understand this is common with parents whose children have developmental disability, but I had no idea at the time that it was a contributor to our failed marriage.\n\nWhen it was time for my daughter to enter pre-kindergarten, my older daughter had been doing great in school for several years, ahead of her peers in almost every subject. Everyone loved her and she was such a sweet girl.\n\nHer baby sister was almost the polar opposite. She barely spoke, had rage-full fits, and obsessive - like behaviors.\n\nI tried to explain this to the teacher at the assessments, but I didn't have the right words, because I didn't know the terms or even what they meant yet. I, along with her dad and gramma, just thought she was a little slower to come out of her shell since her big sister could (and did) help her with everything from talking to getting dressed. We simply believed it was a matter of not needing to express herself because she had someone to do it for her.\n\nAt the first 9 weeks teacher meetings, we got a note requesting a special meeting. It was at this meeting that her teacher told us of her behaviors. Many of which we were familiar with, but it was still a shock to hear them explained to us from a classroom perspective. I wanted to cry. Maybe I did. Like I said before, the details are all fuzzy and run together.\n\nThis teacher was kind, and I'm so grateful that she was, because without her kindness, we may have brushed her off as being a rude and pushy know it all. But, she really loved my daughter and wanted to help. She was instrumental in getting the first IEP set up and helping us to find further help for this child.\n\nNow, 2 years later, that child is still not comfortable in school. She still has lack of control over her own body and emotions. She is still rageful. It took nearly 2 years before anyone officially called her Autistic and even now, there is so much more to learn about how this disorder works.\n\nWhat will her life be like? Will she grow up to be a psychotic maniac, or can she possibly adjust to her environment at some point? Some adults with autism never do, and some can't. They become statistics of the system, jailed and imprisoned for their lack of control and ability to conform.\n\nDid you know that? Did you KNOW that?\n\nI'm afraid for my daughter, and I'm afraid of her. The rates are growing in relation to others like my child.   I only wish I were alone.\n\nJenn Brockman is a single mom of 2 girls, one on the autism spectrum and one with ADHD.

{"date": "Thursday, April 2, 2009", "body": "\nI'm not sure if you are aware of this, but I have a child who is Autistic.\n\nYou may not know, or even realize it when you meet him. It might take a few minutes. Or an hour. But at some point when you meet my son, you will begin to notice he acts different.\n\nIt might be the way he flaps his hands. Or the way he hums to himself. Or the way the conversation he has with you keeps ever-so-slightly going back to the things he likes. It could be because you notice the things he's interested in are younger than he is; or he talks older than his years. You might notice his anxiety.\n\nBut, if you don't realize it, that's okay too. That's okay because we have worked very hard to help him fit into society's mold. We have embraced Early Intervention, ABA, ESE, Inclusion, and a myriad of other therapies and interventions. (Thank you, Quest Kids and UCFCard!)\n\nIn short, we have worked very hard for you not to notice the Autism.\n\nHowever, it is a part of him. It is him. Those quirks will never disappear. They may diminish, but they will never fade totally away.\n\nAnd while it is okay with me, it is clearly not okay with society.\n\nI say that because the media heralds the \"Recovery of Autism\"; that \"Autism is Reversible\". I guess in some cases it could be.\n\nJust not in any cases that I know of. That I personally know of.\n\nNot to mention, the cases that are brought out to the media are the young kids. The ones who benefit from Early Intervention. Many Autistic children will benefit from Early Intervention therapies (my son did!). The articles about older kids are usually how they are coping, how they are adapting to society. How they are dealing. Because it is difficult. Because it is hard.\n\nThese young kids grow up. They become adults. And while Early Intervention can and does help Autistic kids, those kids get older; and as they age, the therapies, the interventions, the assistance gets less and less, until there is no more.\n\nUntil they are totally on their own.\n\nSo today, on World Autism Day, while we should celebrate our successes and appreciate how far we've come, we also need to realize how much further we have to go. We need to reevaluate how we help our children grow into and become adults. Interventions and assistance should not and can not stop when they need us the most.\n\nAnd they do need it.

{"date": "Thursday, April 9, 2009", "body": "\nthis is a repeat of a post on my personal blog from about a year ago..\n\n\n\nNot a lot is written about girls and autism, because it is just beginning to be understood.  When Hans Asperger first classified it, he thought he had found a boys-only disease.  It wasn't until years later that we are finding that more girls are affected than originally thought. The rate for those referred to for diagnostic tests is about ten boys to every one girl.  But of those, the rate of diagnosis is one in four.  That's one girl for every four boys diagnosed.  This rate holds true for both classic and high-functioning autism/Asperger's Syndrome.\n\nIn the book  edited by Tony Attwood, Asperger's and Girls mentions that one of the reasons that girls are less often referred for diagnosis could be that because girls are naturally more nurturing than boys, they take the \"shy and awkward\" girls under their wing.  In this way, they teach them the social rules.\n\nAs a mother of both a boy and a girl with autism, I would agree that girls give more benefit of the doubt than boys do. Girls in elementary school can be kind and helpful to a girl who just doesn't get it.  JBug, my oldest daughter had this experience with a friend.  She is naturally slow to warm, reticent around new people or experiences.  Her friend took her aside and taught her \"Embarrassing Lessons,\" which was really just a way to teach her to laugh at herself and not be so self-concious. JBean has first grade friends that are very kind to her and accept her for who she is, at least at this age.  In contrast, JBear has struggled with his peers, who find him \"weird\" and \"obsessed.\"  He often feels ostracized when it really was a matter of just being able to read cues in order to join a game. \n\n  JBug's friend  also came alongside her and taught her some of what Brenda Smith Myles calls \"the hidden curriculum,\" that is, all of the things that no one ever tells a child, that are considered polite, or kind. For instance, if JBear were to talk about Indiana Jones and as he was doing so, the person he was speaking with kept glancing at his watch and looking over my son's head  , think that has happened before?  that would be pretty clear to me that the person had somewhere to go and the conversation needed to come to a close.  Someone with HFA/Asperger's would not get this reference.  He would have missed the entire \"non-verbal\" conversation. According to a UCLA study, 93% of conversation is non-verbal.  So you can see how difficult it can be to interact if you are effectively blind to the social cues!\n\n\nIn my experience, girls in elementary school are much more forgiving of social gaffes. By the time a girl reaches jr. high, it is expected that she will \"know\" the right things to do and say.  If she does not, most girls will distance themselves from the girl who is less socially-savvy.  Since girls bond with their \"drama,\" any girl who doesn't play the game will almost certainly be, if not ostracized, just not befriended.  I work as a church youth worker with jr high girls (now going into high school).  For two years I have watched this happen.  The interesting thing to me is that if a girl is more severely affected by Asperger's, they do give a little more leeway, but they still do not count that person as a friend.  If a church group operates this way, I can only imagine that school must be even more difficult for a girl with Asperger's Syndrome.\n\nI ran across this article a while ago, about the perils of Asperger's as a female. The information is older, but it bears repeating.\n\nDr Lorna Wing is a veteran psychiatrist who devoted her career to studying autism after her only child, Susie, was diagnosed with a severe form of the condition. She says girls on the autistic spectrum often appear \"normal\" at first meeting.\n\n\"They appear to be more social than boys with autism, but then you notice that their sociability tends to be inappropriate,\" she says. \"They might go on and on talking about the things they are interested in, and they fail to notice that you're not remotely interested. They have a poor ability to 'read' people, and that's something that's often very highly developed in females.\"from the Guardian \n\nThe article goes on to state that it can be difficult in the workplace for a woman with autism, because she doesn't pick up the social cues or display the empathy and understanding that many associate with females. She may face problems because of judgment. \n\nThis means that women with autism often struggle at work because they lack what is often taken for granted in women - the intuitive ability to understand where people are coming from and how to manage situations. Because of subtle sex differences, we tend to \"expect\" more of women in the workplace in terms of smoothing things over, of saying the right thing; and whereas we would excuse a man who lacked these abilities, we are subliminally a lot less forgiving of a woman who has similar shortcomings. from the Guardian\n\n\nWith all of this gloom and doom, sure I am concerned for my girls' futures. JBug has never been diagnosed with Asperger's, but has many traits that come with it, including brilliance, which will serve her well. She is already smarter than I am...shhh! Don't tell her!   I believe JBug will be fine, eventually.  She will find her niche and her \"people\"...once the drama from high school stage is finished.  She doesn't have time for the gossip or the \"immaturity\" of her peers.  Sometimes she is too serious for her own good. She will land in a scientific community, where Logic is king and Rationality rules all.  \n\n My youngest daughter is an enigma to me. JBean has been diagnosed with Autistic Disorder, but is pretty high-functioning.  I don't quite know what will happen with JBean.  She is content to sit and play with her toys, making voices for all of the Ponies, Pet Shops and Puppy in my Pockets.  She makes up long and winding songs about the same.  She will often play, undisturbed for hours, if I let her.  But she also enjoys cuddling with those she loves, reading (or rather, learning to read) and playing/arguing with her brother and sister.  All sounds normal, doesn't it?  And yet... there is that certain \"something\" that makes the autism diagnosis.\n\nShe cuddles a little too much, too hard, and doesn't stop when first asked.  Her voice is just a bit *too high-pitched, almost baby talk. When she wants your attention she goes from 0 decibels to 999,999 in a split second.  We say she has two settings: normal, and car alarm. She is very private about her thoughts, and I don't know if that is because she isn't keyed into them, or she just keeps them to herself.  She is very difficult to read, and I am good at reading people.\n\nShe is still so young.  Who knows what time and training have in store for her?  And maybe as we go, more research will be completed that explains more of the mystery behind autism and what exactly we can do about it.  I am thankful for articles in mainstream publications that shed light on the issue of girls and autism, but they are few and far between.   For now, I continue to work with her, read a lot and pray.  I definitely pray.\n\n\n\nTina Cruz is a writer, wife and mother of three children, two who have high-functioning autism, one who has Asperger's tendencies.

{"date": "Friday, April 3, 2009", "body": "\nOriginally posted at Mamabusypants on April 1.\n\nLife on the Spectrum recently wrote: \"Someone said that they were tired of some parents with children who have autism, painting autism as if it were some sort of cool adventure. Autism is hard, depressing and sometimes unbearable.\"\n\nThat resonates. Mr. Busypants has mild autism, which translates into autism is only mildly a pain in my ass. Sometimes I feel guilty about his mildness. I'm stuck in the middle: my kid's not quite normal, but he's also not completely, hopelessly, overly frustratingly autistic. So while I deal with the \"autistic moments,\" I do not deal with them at the great frequency that many others do.\n\nInitially, the diagnosis and subsequent transitions from babyhood to toddlerland to preschoolville were hard, depressing, and sometimes unbearable. But now, while Mr. Busypants is in Kindergarten at least, the challenges are not much larger than the average parents' (different, but not more overwhelming). That may change, but I feel privileged to just love his mind and the unique perspective he brings to life. At least for now, I get to see it as a cool adventure.\n\nTo be honest, I fear my neuro-typical (NT) daughter, Miss Chattyshoes, drama queen that she already is, will be way harder to raise. She already has an opinion about everything. When she really, really wants something, she repeats herself, each time at a higher decibel, until only dogs in the neighborhood and the dolphins at the Brookfield Zoo are able to hear her.\n\nI'm constantly being ordered to \"sit down mama,\" as she plants her chubby cheeks (yes, the other ones) onto the couch and pats the spot right next to her. It's often frustrating because there's an endless list of things on my To Do list (like laundry, major clean up, grading, dishes, more major clean up, Facebook), but recently I decided to fall in line with the little drill sergeant. I mean, she'll only be little once. So now I'm getting caught up on all kinds of reading. It's distracting to do my Bible study with Elmo in the background, but somehow I manage.\n\nAs for Mr. Busypants, well, so far he is wildly navigating the line between having autism and being a regular kid. He has a lot going for him in that he wants to partcipate with others, but he also has obstacles less known to those who are neuro-typical. He's coping with the sensory bombardment that's magnified because he has autism, the obsessive/compulsive need for structure and repetition as he processes the world around him, and the emerging knowledge that he is indeed different.\n\n\n\nJeannie Anderson is a stay-at-home mom with two children, Mr. Busypants, 6, and Miss Chattyshoes, almost 2. She is a part time college-level writing instructor at three Chicago-area colleges and writes about the Adventures of Mr. Busypants at Mamabusypants.\n\n\nRelated articles by Zemanta World Autism Awareness Day: How Does Your Garden Grow?

{"date": "Friday, April 10, 2009", "body": "\nNever in my life did I think I would call my child over to look at my poop. Never. Disgusting, right? Now, we've all taken a look at our own BM's (bowel movements for those that haven't discussed poop extensively in a clinical setting), perhaps been impressed or grossed out, but that's between you and you, and is extremely personal. But how do you toilet train an Autistic child who isn't speaking yet, and rarely makes nonverbal requests (unless you include gesticulating wildly when he catches a glimpse of Rice Krispie squares on the kitchen counter)? Modeling the appropriate behaviour is one way (hence showing Max my poop). Another key part of toilet training for a child with Autism is getting him used to the routine of toileting, even before he is actually ready to toilet train.\n\nMax will be 3 years old on April 23rd. We know he isn't anywhere near being ready to \"poop in the potty\". It may take him a year or even two before he can manage it. If you think about it, there is a lot required for going the bathroom. If you break the process down, it's no surprise that kids, let alone kids with Autism, find it challenging. We are breaking the process down into tiny steps for Max so that he will gradually be able to incorporate them into his routine. The hope is that when he is ready, toilet training will be less stressful on all of us because he understands what is expected of him.\n\n\nThis is the toileting process as I see it:\n\nRecognize that you have to go to the bathroom\nLet an adult know you have to go the bathroom (verbal or nonverbal communication)\nGo to the actual physical bathroom\nLift toilet lid, get little toilet seat in place\nPull pants down, pull underwear down\nSit on toilet\nRelax\nPoop\nWipe bum\nPull underwear up, pull pants up\nGet down from toilet\nAdmire poop (you know you do this, admit it)\nFlush toilet\nGet up on stool to wash hands\nTurn water on\nSoap up hands (the soap texture is hard for some Autistic kids)\nRub hands together\nRinse hands\nDry hands\nDo a big cheer for completing the process\n\nThat's no less than 20 steps! Geez...and we parents expect our kids to get this down in a day? Seems a bit unreasonable, even for a neurotypical kid.\n\nWe have reduced the process down to 3 steps for Max:\n\nChange diaper\nPut poop in potty, flush\nWash hands\n\nHe seems to be fairly comfortable with these steps, and isn't objecting to having his diaper changed nearly as much as he used to. I think this is because he knows that when we go in the bathroom, it is to change his diaper. We are being very clear about what is going to happen by using an activity strip, and telling him what we are doing and what is going to come next. He now reaches for the handle to flush the toilet after we put his poop in the toilet, and then moves to the stool to get up to wash his hands. I need to add a \"dry hands\" image for him, and also put a picture of a diaper on the front of the bathroom door so that he can either point to it, or bring it to me when he needs a diaper change. This process will not be completed in one day, but it will eventually result in Max being toilet trained. We just have to remind ourselves that this is a marathon and not a race.\n\nOne more thing - if you live in Canada, and your child is over the age of 3 years old and has a disability, you are eligible to receive funding for diapers from Easter Seals. With the costs of Max's therapy mounting, I am looking forward to getting help paying for diapers (though hopefully we won't need it for very long!)\n\nKatrina Carefoot is a working mom with two children, her son Max, almost 3, and her daughter Cameron, almost 1.

{"date": "Saturday, April 18, 2009", "body": "\n\n\n\nIt started over tea.  She wanted to have a tea party.  But she didn't want to use water. That's for babies!  She wanted me to make tea. Which I couldn't do, I was helping her older sister with her Algebra.  Part of homeschooling is taking turns.  Littles, at 7, isn't always good with that.  Well, let's face it, she is really bad at it.  When it is her turn, she expects everyone else to wait.  But make her wait?  And it is Meltdown-City.  She will extract her pound of flesh, one way or another. Of course, it passed.  It always does.  But the aftermath for me is the hardest part.  The way I am left feeling: drained, defeated, ready to cry.\n\nI suppose I shouldn't be too upset.  She hasn't had a tantrum all week long.  Her dad was gone for ten days and in that time, she has been fine.  We have had a few  missteps here and there, but no full blown I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU episodes.  Maybe that means she is getting older. Maybe that means the developmental delay that is Autism Spectrum Disorder is righting itself.  Maybe that means the naked chanting that I did by melting green crayon and throwing sheets to the wind has paid off. (I am just kidding about that last part.) Maybe it's just that the tide is high and the moon is low.  Hell, I don't know.\n\nAnd that's part of the problem. I don't know.  If you ask me a question about grammar or algebra or llama breeding, I can probably tell you. Or, barring that, I can find out.   But as far as the exact reason my daughter is tantrumming, or the tried and true foolproof method of stopping said fit, that seems to be missing on Google.  Certainly there are suggestions, but what if they don't work?  What then? With children, you don't add A to B and necessarily get C.\n\n If I was a carpenter, I would be sure that I have the latest tools, the best ones to get the job done. A hammer will always work as a hammer.  A level, well, that's designed for leveling. With just a few simple tools, a carpenter can build many things.  With a few more, he becomes a master craftsman.  It can take a lifetime to wield the tools correctly.  But even if his skill is only passable, he will be able to create a chair.\n\nAs a parent, I work hard to develop my parenting skills. I think if had neurotypical children I would be a pretty good parent. I add tools to my toolbox often.  They say if you only tool you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. I am guilty of this at times.  But a soft word or patience?  Those don't always work.  In truth, there are times that I run out of tools in my toolbox.  I keep thinking if I just gain more gadgets, if I just learn more schematics, I will, eventually, build the Taj Mahal.  But with autism?  All bets are off. Sometimes, a level ends up as a fulcrum. Or a hammer ends up as a paper weight. Sometimes, I end up dancing around like a monkey because I have to think outside the box.  Down is up, and and Left is Right and OhMyGod is it 5 o' clock yet??  \n\nI am not a drinker. I have a bit of Irish Cream or Kahlua in my hot cocoa or coffee about twice a month. A glass of wine about as often. And though I talk about it, I just don't do it.  There are times I wish I did drink more.  Then I wouldn't care so damn much when I reach the end of the toolbox and find nothing but sandpaper and a ball ping hammer.  But I do care, and it kills me and I always wonder, why can't I be a better parent? Why can't I help her calm down before she gets to that place where she is completely unreasonable?  Why must I be left  feeling like a hollow shell with every nerve exposed?

{"date": "Thursday, April 23, 2009", "body": "\nI have no idea.\n\n\nBy the word normal, I mean typical.  Regular.  What you expect to get when you get a kid.  The  word most people use anyway, whether or not it's PC these days or not...\n\n\n\nI'll go ahead and say it:  My kids are not normal.  I can be OK with that to a point.  There are a lot of people that are not normal.  I sure don't mean to step on any toes here, so please don't take offense.  I am in no way trying to insult anyone or anyone else's kids. But my sweet kids, they are not normal.\n\n\n\nI have three children.  E (boy) is 11, L (boy) is 6 and K (girl) is almost 2.  E has Asperger's ADHD and OCD, L has high functioning Autism and K is speech impaired, very delayed in all areas and though not diagnosed yet, she stims and requires a lot of special accommodating, just like her brothers. \n\n\n\nI suppose people feel sorry for me and my husband, but I don't want anyone to. I just would love for people to be more educated about this messed up world of Autism.  How there are so many degrees, variations, exceptions, labels, theories, treatment options and it's confusing.  It's not just that \"your kids are delayed, they act a little strange, they'll outgrow it - hopefully\".  Not even close, thank you very much.\n\n\n\nMy kids  look completely normal and sometimes you can look at them and would never know there is anything different about them.  At first.  But E has no social skills and flaps his hands against his legs and in his lap very loudly. He repeats things he heard over and over (yeah, like Rainman).   L gets overwhelmed, sometimes freaks out and clamps his hands over his ears and will not take them off. He babbles like a baby in some little babble language he made up and can only put together a few words at times.  K still eats baby food from a jar and still drinks from a bottle because she can't tolerate much else or she gags and throws up. She screams and goes ballistic if we go anywhere where there are too many people or there is too much noise.\n\nThe two older ones still have toilet issues and need pull-ups sometimes.  They ride the special bus.  They're in special ed classes.  They have almost no awareness of how other kids their age behave, even when they are around them.  They get upset and throw screaming temper tantrums if something we see as trivial upsets them.  They don't get concepts other kids much younger than them seem to understand.  We don't go to movies, the zoo, museums, the beach, the library, Chuck E Cheese,anyone's home or any other place that would be certain disaster should I be brave enough to try to take just one of them there.  Too much light, noise, people, excitement, activity, etc.  Yes, my kids have had complete meltdowns in public.  The first rule that I learned the hard way is:  don't make eye contact! When my kid starts up in public and it's getting ugly, I don't make eye contact with anyone! Focus on the child and deal with it accordingly. Yes, people look and sometimes they comment.  So?  I deal with my kid, not the ignorant person that isn't minding their business.\n\n\n\nThis is not even all of it.  See, this Autism thing, way more than any parent bargains for..\n\n\n\nYou can't just  give kids like this more discipline, or expect them to suck it up and act normal, or try to distract them with a toy or video or something.  This is just who my kids are and it's all I know.  And as bad as this sounds, please know that my kids are the sweetest, most beautiful babies to me.  They are capable of loving us, and each other.  They have strengths, skills, and something to offer.  They are special and unique.  And sometimes, they surprise when they do or say something typical.\n\n\n\nI do make my kids behave, apologize when they have done something they should not have,  and I am teaching them manners.  I will not let Autism be an excuse for my kids to get away with doing anything that would be wrong or cause harm to others..\n\n\n\nIt's hard for me to relate to parents of typical kids.  I will never know what it's like to have a normal child.  And I don't know what it is that caused all of mine to have this.  And it's not something I can really make anyone understand if they are not going through it themselves.\n\nI hope  this blog can help anyone that would like to understand more, either for themselves because they have a child with Autism, or as someone that wants to know more because they don't.\n\nRelated articles by Zemanta Let's Talk about Autism and Homeschooling and ..Craziness  (autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com) Autism and Homeschooling: Why?

Hate is a strong word. But, it really sums up how I feel about this. It bothers me. We all have something in common, a child with autism. That should unite us, yet instead we are so very divided. Attacking each other for our beliefs on whether autism was a result of an environmental trigger or vaccines or genetic. Attacking each other for our avenues for our choices in therapies or interventions.\n\nWhy the hostility?\n\nI have many many friends who are also moms of autistic kids, like myself. I'm part of several parent groups online and off and I wouldn't have it any other way. Some of my friends are like me and others very different.  I have friends who do biomed and friends who don't. Friends who believe their child was autistic from birth & genetics and others who feel it was environmental or vaccines. I have friends with kids on the diet (like my son) and friends who think the diet is a waste of money. I have friends who do chelation and/or HBOT and friends who do not.\n\nThose who know me, or read my blog know that I practice the GFCF diet for my child. I've also shared info on some supplements that he uses. I don't get into nitty gritty on dosages or meds we may or may not use as I don't think that's the general public's business. This past week I reviewed two books that deal with biomed - Jenny McCarthy's new book and LeeAnn Whiffen's book.  Immediately I witnessed fallout among my circle of \"friends\" because I go on record as doing some biomed for my child. How dare I? I've taken a side. I'm Biomed. I'm the evil. I SUCK!

{"date": "Sunday, May 3, 2009", "body": "\nThe month of April has come to a close, and with it ends Autism Awareness Month. However, so many of us don't have an end to Autism. It is an ongoing, daily struggle filled with accomplishments, setbacks, discoveries, joy and pain. It is a journey, and the topography changes moment by moment. However, it is filled with the most wonderful people you could ever come across. But we as a community are fractured. Broken. Divided. Split along lines that should not be there; dividing a group that needs to band together to help our children and our friends and family members gather hope and strength to face our special brand of challenges.  To help us weather this storm. Here are some things I would like the Autism Community to really think about and consider making changes to in the next year: Start thinking about what the future holds for our children on the Spectrum. Our focus has been laser-like on the birth-to-three side of the disorder, and you will hear no argument from me that early intervention is key; but in our haste to put all of our eggs in one basket and cure! recover! heal! we have overlooked a large group of children on the spectrum that still need assistance - the Adults. All of these children grow up to be adults, and as they age, the assistance gets less and less. The transition from young adult to adult is equally as important to a child on the spectrum as it is for that same child during early childhood. We need to remember to look at their lives as a spectrum as well, and provide assistance throughout their entire lives. Acknowledge that not all children can be \"cured\" of Autism, and that most are not. This is what is fracturing the Autism community and giving false hope to parents. I am not Jenny McCarthy, my child is not \"cured\", and many of us need to be okay with that. My son is a teenager, and while he has grown by leaps and bounds, he still has challenges that will plague him the rest of his life. We need to be okay with the thought that this is a process. I tell my friends that have read Ms. McCarthy's books (I have as well for purposes of full disclosure) that I would like to see what she has to say in a few years when her son gets older. I think she will find that the \"cure\" she spoke of in her books is not the permanent one she was hoping for. That money has been funneled into the wrong areas for far too long.  Many parents, myself included, are tired of hearing that more money from Autism charities are being funneled into discovering how this happened and which additives in vaccines caused this. Should we \"Green our Vaccines\"? Absolutely. Should we change the schedule? Probably. Should we be the only group saying this to the world at large?  NO.  We need to find another soapbox that fits the needs of ALL of our children on the Spectrum, not just the ones who get the most air and face time. Not just the younger ones. If you are going to Rescue an entire Generation, it helps to make sure you include everyone, no? Start building a community; one that serves ALL in it. I had the pleasure recently to spend time with a group of kids and their families that cancer had touched in some way, shape or form. What struck me deep in my heart was the bond these people share, the closeness, the support. People from all walks of life, celebrities, sports heroes, all donate time, resources and money to support and care for these families in this scary, rough and expensive time. And they keep on giving and many pay it forward after they no longer need as much help. The Autism community has nothing like this, and quite frankly it breaks my heart. If we had had even one-tenth of this amazing resource to help families share, bond, get assistance, and gather strength and hope; it would be amazing. If this help is available to us currently, it more than likely has strings attached. Strings of \"cure\". Remember that we are not perfect, and that there is so much to learn. Take a class. Listen in on a Webinar. Read. Discuss. Tell your story; don't be afraid or embarassed. We need to learn from each other. We need to spread the word. Autism and Spectrum Disorders are relatively new to the world vernacular, and we need to raise awareness. That being said\u2026 Don't scare people by sending frightening messages related to Autism. Don't equate Autism to a plague, or a horrific act. Someone who I follow on Twitter sends out messages about Autism that only confuse and frighten people. Scaring people into learning about Autism only mixes our message even further. There are many people who are coming forward and revealing that they have ASD and grew up during a time when many had no idea how to work with people who had Autism. Their stories are inspirational, and we need to pay attention. Appreciate how far we have come\u2026  Autism has had more air time in recent months than in previous years. That's a good thing. The fact that there are services for our children, therapies and interventions to help our children grow and function in society is something to be proud of. The accommodations in the schools and the support staff to help our children has increased three-fold. It's wonderful to see. \u2026but remember we have so much further to go.  We need to do more. We need to ask for more. We need to demand more. We need to ask for more services. We need to build an infrastructure to support our families who have no idea what to do or where to go when they are just starting down the road. We need to help those still struggling down that road. We need to work with the medical community to build a stronger protocol to get testing and services for our children earlier than second grade. So let's get together and feel all right. Let's get together on our global message and remember to include everyone, not just the people that fit a particular (cured) category. Let's work together to spread the collective word that while some children see great improvement with different interventions; let's remember that one size does not fit all, and we need to look at the bigger picture for our children. The lifetime picture.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 19, 2009", "body": "\nthe following is post from my personal blog, dated two years ago.\n\n\nTrying to teach any child self-control is tough.   When you are dealing with a child with autism, there are added challenges.  It isn't that they can't learn, they do.  It's just that with autism, often learning takes the form of rote scripts that are hard to apply to situations that deviate from the taught scenario.  The ability to adapt just isn't there.  I tell you this so that I can tell you this story.\n\nLast night, J and I wanted to go out. We don't get a lot of opportunities to do that, because even though I have given birth to the World's Most Responsible 14 Yr Old, let's face it, leaving her in charge of two younger kids with autism is something to question.   But last night, my littlest one said that J and I needed to go out.  You need to understand that she was falling apart earlier, not so much in a catastrophic way but more in a \"I am really whiny and complaining about everything\" way.  The Wii can do that to all of my children.  Hell, it can do that to me!\n\nJBean was trying to convince me that we needed to let them stay home.  We were planning on a late movie, so there would only be an hour that the kids would be up.  JBug puts them to bed for us. To assure me that I was making the right decision, JBean said:\n\"Momma, I can do what they taught us in Sunday School today... SPUD.\nSelf-Control \nPause\nUnderstand\nDecide\nI can control my self!\"\n\nMost parents would be thrilled by this.  Instead I took it to heart as my failure.   When you homeschool, everything is your fault.  I said to to J, \"I have been trying to teach her this stuff for years, and she picks it up in five minutes in Sunday School?  Maybe I need to send her to school to learn, because she isn't getting it from me. I'm failing.\"   He looked at me and said, \"She got it today because you have been going over controlling herself over and over again.  Repeat, repeat, repeat.  It clicked because of you.\"  My eyes filled with tears, and I spoke..\n\n\"That was the right answer.\"\n\n\nT, who takes it all too personally \n\n\nTina Cruz is a writer, wife and mother of three children, two who have high-functioning autism, one who has Asperger's tendencies.

Both of my siblings have been diagnosed with high functioning autism. Autism certainly isn't easy to live with. I share a room with my seven year old sister, a feat that requires much patience at times.\nHow do you explain that at 8:00 in the morning, you don't yell at the cat to get out of the closet? (Who cares that the cat is wearing a tiara? I'm trying to sleep!)  How do you explain that you can't understand someone when they are yelling at the frequency of a car alarm? How do you explain that you are busy and can't play with plastic toys? Again and again and again and...\nWhen they wake up at 3 in the morning because they had a bad dream or they sob their heart out because they miss the cats that died in a fire...when they ask \"why God?\"... when you yourself ask \"why God?\" When you meet someone new and they ask \"Is she five?\" and you say \"No, she's almost eight\" and it breaks your heart...when she's excluded from a group of kids, and you see the parallels between seven-year-old girls and high school cliques, and big-sister syndrome kicks in which makes you immediately want to go make it better, but you know that, sooner or later, you just won't be there...When you are having a bad day, and she comes up, wanting a hug, and you snap at her to leave you alone, and her face crumbles, and you feel lower than the bacteria that live on bacteria that live on a piece of dirt...And when you apologize and she forgives you like nothing ever happened, that's autism.\nAnd when all is said and done, yes, she still has autism, but she is your sister, and she does need to be loved. Autism is just one aspect of her, not what defines her. And, as hard as that is to remember, it makes all the difference.\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I need to go love my sister.\n\npicture of eyeglasses, cc, via flickr, sheepguardingllama\n\nJBug grudgingly admits that she is Tina's fifteen year old daughter (after all, she has to have someone to blame for her DNA) and is big sis to JBear and JBean.

{"date": "Tuesday, August 11, 2009", "body": "\nThis is my first time posting to this blog, so bear with me.  Its just that this topic has been weighing heavy on my mind lately and it hit a chord on my blog, so I thought I'd share.\n-------\n\nScattered. Space Cadet. Flake. These are all terms I'm sure have been used to describe me. Maybe because over the years I've backed out of more than my fair share of commitments. Its gotten so bad that I now run when I see a well-intended parent seeking volunteers for some good cause.\n\nIts not that I have a fear of commitment, its just that I can never commit. If I do, the Murphy's Law that is my life automatically kicks in and all hell breaks loose. Either there's a meltdown, a rage, sheer exhaustion or all of the above involved. Lets face it, these tend to get in the way of making 100 cupcakes for the school play.\n\nThen I'm left to make that awkward phone call telling the nice organizer I can't do whatever it is I'm supposed to do. This is followed by the equally awkward silence or heavy sigh as the person on the other end of the phone expresses their obvious displeasure with me.\n\nIts during these times that I really wish I could scream at the top of my lungs, \"Don't you get it, I have REAL problems here.\" But since I don't make a point of advertising our situation, there's no way for those in the outside world to know. To them I look like any other mom -- one with messy hair, more than a few extra pounds and no make-up yes, but pretty average all the same.\n\nSo, how do I keep getting myself into this situation? Because deep down I want to help. I'd like to be the one helping others instead of the one accepting it all the time. In my dreams I fancy myself the room mom, the cookie mom, the church volunteer. Then my kids could remember their mom as the one who was always involved, always there to lend a helping hand, instead of the one too harried to brush her teeth.\n\nThe solution? I have a few ideas brewing. I'm toying with the idea of sporting a sign that reads something like: DANGER: SPECIAL NEEDS MOM. APPROACH WITH CAUTION. Or maybe I can just hand out cards describing our present catastrophe. The problem is, after reading a few lines of what our average day is like, I'm not sure anyone will believe me.\n\nThat's what happens when you have children with hidden disabilities. They \"look\" normal, and for the most part can act normal too. So even if you do 'fess up, many people will look at you in total disbelief. Then starts the minimization. \"Oh, it can't be that bad.\" Or, \"honey, all kids go through that phase.\"\n\nSo I think the next Super Mom who corners me in the parking lot asking if I could \"be a dear and.....\" will just be given a link to this blog. Maybe then she'll find a little empathy for my scattered brain. If nothing else, it will give me a good exit so I can wallow in my flakiness in peace.\n\nI am the mother of four children -- a teenager, a toddler and tween twins.  My twins both have their \"issues\", one with Asperger's Syndrome and Bipolar, the other with Bipolar and ADHD.  This means our house is anything but quiet and reserved. I also write a blog, Raising Complicated Kids,that chronicles our experience with our not-so-average family.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://accidentalexpert.blogspot.com"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2009/08/super-mom-im-not.html", "title": "A Super Mom I'm Not"},

I also\nwrite a blog, Raising Complicated Kids, that chronicles our experience with our not-so-average family.  \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://accidentalexpert.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2009/11/calling-all-siblings.html", "title": "Calling All Siblings"},
{"date": "Thursday, November 12, 2009", "body": "\n\n\n\nWhen my husband I walked out of the doctor's office with a diagnosis of \"autism\" for our middle child, I wish the doctor had handed me something like\u00a0Same Child, Different Day, a booklet I've recently learned about.\u00a0 The author Jon R. Gilbert writes on the back cover,\u00a0 \"This booklet was written by the family of a child with autism. It is meant to provide a little insight into what you could expect during the first year after the diagnosis, based on our own experiences. Your results will vary.\"\n\n\n\n\nMy husband and I were driving past past the mailbox on our way to \"date night.\" I made him stop to see if the envelop I'd been waiting for had arrived. I opened it eagerly and read through the table of contents as my husband drove to the restaurant. I laughed out loud and had to start reading the chapter titles to my husband to let him in on the joke. Even though we'd been living with the diagnosis of autism in the family for six years, just the titles brought back memories.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGilbert starts each chapter with practical information and ends each chapter with a story from their own family. The first chapter states his purpose. \"Over the course of the year following Nolan's diagnosis we encountered many situations where we could have benefited from some simple, fluff-free, honest direction. Circumstances arose (and are still arising) where we could have used some insider information, a simple heads-up or a fair warning.\" Then he dives right in with Nolan's first haircut. My husband and I laughed until we cried because we could have written the same story. And yes, it would've been great to have some insider information or a heads up BEFORE we entered that situation.\n\n\n\n\nSame Child, Different Day is a great source for information when you are first walking out the doctor's office in shock and don't know where to turn first. Gilbert has a few pages defining soon to be familiar terms and concepts. I even learned some new ones after six years of my own reading and research into autism. He provides some well-respected and acknowledged resources by way of websites, books and mailing addresses. He also gives some insight into the lifestyle changes, the attitudes you'll face in public, the meltdowns the child will have and hints at the toll it starts to take on the family.\n\n\n\n\nI like the booklet because it is factual, neutral and still upbeat. The growing awareness of autism being diagnosed in one out of 150 children has made the subject emotional, political, and sometimes, controversial. I respect the fact Gilbert touches on these areas without making you aware of his own opinions. Because of this, I believe this booklet would be beneficial to have in all medical practices, educational settings and organizations dealing with autism, especially for those families first entering into this new and scary world.\n\n\n\n\nThe book is reasonably priced and available for bulk rates. For more information contact Jon Gilbert at his website by the same name\u00a0Same Child, Different Day.\n\n\nI'm a mother of three children ranging from 7 to 17 years old.

{"date": "Wednesday, November 18, 2009", "body": "\nI was standing in line at the grocery store, waiting to pay for the basket full of groceries I had amassed on my once a month grocery stock-up. I hate grocery shopping, especially with kids, but I had procrastinated too long and the bread had molded and we were out of milk. My children were trying valiantly to hold it together; it was late in the afternoon and had been a long day.  Grocery shopping is a break from the Routine that basically rules our lives, so often there is a difficulty in this endeavor.  But today the children were on their best behavior.  They were helping put groceries on the conveyor belt, while JBean kept up a steady stream of chatter. Today it wasn't them, it was me.  My head was throbbing: I needed caffeine and I needed quiet.My son decided to chat up the person behind us: \"Do you like Mario Kart?\"  The person mumbled something politely, too quietly for me to hear. JBear took this as an invitation and continued, \"I have Mario Kart for the DS. I  also have a Wii.  Do you have a Wii?  I like playing boxing. I am good at boxing.\"  I glanced back and the woman he was talking to seemed ok with her verbose companion, if a bit noncommittal.  My son continued: \"Did you see the Indiana Jones movie? I did, it was good.  They have the Lego game of Indiana Jones for the Wii coming out next month. I want that. Lego also makes a Star Wars game for the DS. They are making one for the Wii, but it's not out yet...\"  Again, I glanced back and saw the woman shuffling her feet, looking around nervously.  Time to reign him in.  \"JBear, shh! Come help me with the groceries.\" He didn't hear me.  I had to call him three times. Then he started asking for gum at the checkout counter. And a yo yo. Pleeeeease?  He has this trip-switch, when he has something on his mind, when he wants something, he just keeps asking. I don't even know if he realizes he does it.   About that time, the lady got that look.  Oh, you don't know the look?  Simple.When people notice something is a bit different with your kids, they react in one of two ways.  The first group widens their eyes in amazement and says, \"Boy, you sure have your hands full!\" And yes, yes, I do.  But it is what it is.  I don't have an \"S\" embroidered underneath my t-shirt.  I am just a mom, dealing with what I have been given. I don't want praise and I don't want pity.  But often,  they look at me as though I stepped from a space ship, a complete alien entity.  If I throw the homeschool aspect in to the conversation, I see the door slam shut, the eyes cloud over, and I can almost hear the voice in their head as they thank the Lord that they don't have kids like mine, and thank goodness it isn't contagious!The other group I encounter widens their eyes in surprise and says, \"But they seem so normal.\"  This is actually frustrating.  This is the reaction I get when I try to explain Asperger's.  I know that on the spectrum of special needs, Asperger's is considered pretty low.  And my kids are actually mildly affected.  Their behaviors are more annoying or frustrating than dangerous.  My son has not eloped from a classroom since the First Grade.  Of course, it helps that he has been homeschooled since the Second Grade, I suppose.He does have an anger and frustration problem.  In fact, when he is angry, he could give a salty dawg a run for his grog.  He has recently decided that it is really cool to respond to any insult, real or imagined, \"I know you are!\"  You can imagine how productive that is!  He is in the habit of cornering people, because he is a social guy.  He wants to interact, and find interesting things in common, but he doesn't pick up the cues when someone has had enough. I am constantly playing watch dog for him, translating so they will not miss out on what he has to offer, worried that people won't like him.  Or worse maybe, they will judge me because of who he is. I am not in the habit of explaining myself to random strangers, but I must be lacking.   When I do try to explain to someone who inevitably asks, \"What's Asperger's,\" I can sometimes hear, \"Well, all kids do THAT.\"  And yes, that's true.  All kids do prattle on about minutiae.  All kids have terrible table manners.  All kids get mad and frustrated and yell.  All kids don't know how to figure out when you have had enough of them.  All kids interrupt.  All kids wear the same clothes, every day, even if they are dirty, and get ticked off if told they can't wear that shirt again until it is washed. All kids harp over and over again about allowance, video games they want, going to the library...whatever it is that is on their mind at that very moment.  All kids throw fits when they don't get their way.  All kids need help getting dressed, even when they can actually accomplish this task themselves. All kids have unreasonable fears and cannot take out the garbage at night or get up to go to the bathroom in a darkened room.  But the point here, is mine do it more.  That's what Asperger's and High-Functioning Autism looks like.   I didn't want bragging rights.  I am not trying to one-up anyone else.  I am simply trying to live with kids who have to live with \"mild-mannered Autism.\" Anyone who uses this term clearly has never lived with nor experienced autism.I don't play the Label Game. I don't have Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. I don't find my identity in being Supermom or having kids with \"special needs.\"     We sought a diagnosis for my son simply because he wasn't functioning in school very well, and we started seeing some signs at home. I  knew something was wrong.  I wrote a letter to the school, asking for an evaluation.  The district did their tests, gave us their result, and then we obtained our own private evaluation. We ended up with a diagnosis and an IEP.  With some interventions and by educating myself, we found accommodations that worked for him.  I learned how to talk to him, how to calm him down, how to provide a sensory diet and just learn to live with the quirkiness that can be autism.  At some point, I started rolling with the flow, and it became, if not easy, something familiar. And, it was okay. I thought that was the end. Autism had touched us, but it was a tentative touch.Cut to 2006.  Those who read will know this already, but we had a house fire, and lost everything. The house was standing, but they gutted it, and rebuilt everything but the bones.  Every item except for the clothes on our backs was destroyed.  Of course, we all took it hard, but my then-six year old was particularly devastated. It was and is, the only home she'd ever known.   On a good day, she keeps most of her emotions to herself.  This caused her to retreat inside herself.  She would build little worlds with her My Little Ponies, and Littlest Pet Shop,  barricade herself inside the toy houses. Walls of toys would sit between her and the rest of us; she was shutting us out.  We sought counseling, and of course, the question we all had was, is it the trauma or is she also on the Spectrum as well?  After what we thought was a failed bout of counseling, it proved to be the catalyst and we decided to have our little JBean evaluated for autism.  I went back and forth, second-guessing myself.  Autism is a spectrum, and there is a saying, \"If you've seen one kid with Asperger's, you've seen one kid with Asperger's.  My son and daughter are as different as night and day.  I would look at her and think, \"No way she is on the Spectrum...she isn't like JBear.\" I waffled and tested her myself, and I wanted to be wrong.   She was diagnosed with autistic disorder two years ago.So when the woman behind me  gave me that look, I just smiled at her and said, \"Kids!\"  About that time, the cashier finished ringing up my groceries.  There is a time for education, and there is a time for cutting your losses and just getting the heck out of Dodge. So I'm sorry to the autism advocates,just know some days I fight the good fight. But today I pulled myself up by my bootstraps.  This wasn't the day to try and educate the public.  This was a day to take my children home with me, cuddle them close and read books while munching cookies.  This was a day to just be. I swallowed the lump in my throat that came from unshed tears. Yes, sometimes I grieve for what they don't have.  And maybe that's not what Supermom would do. As I rolled out to the car, I realized the lump in my throat wasn't just grief. It was something else, as well.  It was a fierce, protective love, and a knowing that I am exactly where I am supposed to be.  And I don't think that Supermom could have it any better.T, who just does what she can do some daysTina Cruz is a writer, wife and mother of three children, two who have high-functioning autism, one who has Asperger's tendencies.

{"date": "Tuesday, November 24, 2009", "body": "\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t the sky the most beautiful shade of cerulean blue today?\u201d\n\nI thought he was color blind, because when I asked what color an object was, he would tell me the wrong one. In school, turned out not only did he know cerulean blue, as he told his teacher, he knew the entire box of Crayola 64 crayons! He wore an Indiana Jones fedora for three straight years. He wouldn\u2019t wear anything but tan pants to \u201clook like Indy\u201d for at least two years. When he was younger, I had to flush the toilet for him, he couldn\u2019t stand the sound. He loved water play and would spend hours playing at the sink. He hates to cut his hair. He can tell you more than you ever wanted to know about UFOs, Mythbusters and the latest video game to capture his interest, but he couldn\u2019t tell the librarian his phone number. He cries easily, especially when frustrated, which also happens frequently. He knows what direction he is traveling at any given moment. He notices details that would escape most of us. Like the time they painted a gas station bench\u2026the new color, the old color\u2026doesn\u2019t matter. He remembers. But he can\u2019t recall his math facts. He doesn\u2019t like doing activities that are not of his own choosing, and hates to perform on cue. He cannot eat gluten or dairy without a lengthy side trip to the bathroom. Consequently, he is on a special diet. He still moves snails out of harms way, just as he once did when he was two. He is now eleven.\n\nShe yowls like a cat when she is angry. Hours are spent in solitary play. She is very imaginative, creating elaborate worlds in her play, but other people don\u2019t easily fit into her scenarios. She can be very rigid. She likes routine. She has a hard time with transitions, even when it is something she really wants to do. Her self-control, while improving, can be difficult. She eats almost anything, and more than you would think\u2026she is a elfin little thing. She cannot read well yet, and doesn\u2019t so much want to. She must be taught concepts repeatedly in order for them to take. Sometimes they do. She is a sensory-seeker, needing a lot of hugs, cuddles and attention. If she doesn\u2019t get it, she will act out negatively. We call it \u201cgetting her pound of flesh\u201d one way or another. Her whole life is a song. Even her voice is a song: a high-pitched melodious voice is used in conversation. Unless she is yelling. She speaks in half sentences. \u201cWant cookie!\u201d She is social, and loves having friends. She likes being in charge. She has trouble understanding changed decisions\u2026she is certain they are lies. If I say something, I must follow through. She has a memory like an elephant, when it comes to things she cares about. She throws the worst tantrums I have ever seen. She is eight.\n\nShe loved to swing as a baby. At three, she threw horrible fits. I would have to hold her to keep her from hurting herself and me. In preschool, while other girls wanted to be a mom, she told her teacher she wanted to be a paleontologist. When her teacher expressed confusion she told her, \" You know, a scientist that studies dinosaurs. Everyone knows that!\" She taught herself to read at three and a half. She was reading chapter books by age five. She was a walking dictionary. She loves Biology, genetics, Latin, Logic. She is very literal, black and white and has a strong sense of justice. She doesn\u2019t always pick up nuances. Interruption of conversations comes naturally to her, but not because she is rude, she just doesn\u2019t get the rhythm of the talk. She understands sarcasm, but doesn\u2019t appreciate it. She struggles with perfectionism, and a lot of anxiety. She taught herself to knit and play the piano. She tries hard to fit in with her peers, but there is always something just different about her. We say she is the \u201coldest thirty year old\u201d we know. She is fifteen.\n\nSome may say, \u201cWell, sure, that is any kid!\u201d But truly, my kids are like the amp in the movie Spinal Tap . Most amps went to ten. But the one in Spinal Tap went to eleven, \u201cthat\u2019s one more, isn\u2019t it? \u201d And that\u2019s what my kids are\u2026just a bit more.. a bit harder. This is what autism looks like in my house. I have no idea what causes it. I only know I watch my children struggle with it. We are fortunate, I suppose, since the picture I paint you is of high-functioning autism. They all have speech. They don\u2019t spin. Or flap.  But it still affects our lives. We walk on eggshells. It isn\u2019t so much a cure I want\u2026as an answer of what caused it, but if you ask my kids, they will tell you they want a cure. They say it is hard to live in their skin. I can see that\u2019s true.\n\n Every day, I see that\u2019s true.\n\nTina Cruz is a writer, wife and mother of three children, two who have high-functioning autism, one who has Asperger's tendencies.

{"date": "Sunday, March 21, 2010", "body": "\nWhen I had my first child, thirty years ago, I was still a child myself.  In fact, I think I still was when I had my third child eight years later. I made mistakes along the way but I always loved being a mother.  It was the most fulfilling and rewarding thing I had ever done with my life. When my children grew up and moved away, I felt empty. I felt as if I no longer had purpose in my life. So, seventeen months ago at the age of 46 and with an ailing husband and a few health issues of my own, my husband and I became foster parents to an eight-month-old boy. Because the father is a relative of mine, I knew the history and knew that our foster child would become our child. What we didn't know was that he would be diagnosed with Autism.\n\nDespite his diagnosis, we love Matty and we adopted him on November 20, 2009. At that point, he had lived with us for 13 months. We really didn't think that raising him was going to change much in our lives. Because of my husband's illness, we had already stopped doing many of things we previously enjoyed. We actually thought that having a baby would be a fun new life for us. (We both had children from prior marriages but none together.)  We even thought that having a laughing happy baby would help my husband to feel better. Give him a new and bright focus so he wouldn't dwell on his iron lung. And you know, for a while it really worked.  But, Autism changes everything. \nWhen you think you know all there is to know about Autism, you have a lot to learn. Anyone who says that he/she knows all about Autism is a liar. Autism is a mystery. It is an unpredictable series of who-knows-what. Every day is so the same yet so very very different. What the Autistic child loves one day can throw him into a total meltdown the next day. Things we take for granted; eating, washing, sleeping, become an issue. \n\n   Mealtime. Once upon a time, this was the most pleasant part of the day. Now, it's a thing we fear. If the food doesn't look right or feel right, (yes, I said feel right because he must touch and squeeze and lick every item on his plate.) he won't eat it.  The few things he will eat wreak havoc in his over sensitive belly. He won't eat cereal but rocks are great. He won't eat rice but lint is wonderful! This leads to the next issue SLEEP. I remember it, I miss it, and I long for it!  I think at this point I may even kill for it if I had the strength and wasn't in so much pain. But, when Matty doesn't sleep, no one sleeps.\n \nOur days begin at 6:30 AM. We strive to keep life as structured as possible for Matty because any change is apt to drive him into himself and cause the day to run on into the wee wee hours while he tries to sort it out. For example, Last week, we had a visitor just before dinner. It was a family member that Matty has only seen a few times and she only stayed about an hour. Matty withdrew during the visit then became very cranky at bedtime. It took two full hours of walking and rocking his 35 pounds to sleep that night. That was a minor thing. Christmas week was one looooong day for us. But that\u2019s another story.  A structured day for us consists of keeping meals, snacks, naps, and playtimes at the same time every day. Except for the one hour of therapy Matty gets each week, we are alone. From early morning to after dinner it is two old people chasing this child around trying to keep him safe from himself. He is obsessed with anything dangerous; stairways, outlets, climbing onto windowsills, tables, bookcases, and lately the shelves of the entertainment center too. A simple \u201cNO!\u201d does not divert him. He ignores all verbal commands and seems to know that we can\u2019t get up fast enough to stop him on his path of self-destruction.\n  \nAfternoons on good weather days, I take him outdoors where I stand over him pulling pebbles out of his mouth or stopping him from pouring sand into his ears. He does fine in his stroller, sometimes for a full ten minutes!  Back indoors while I cook a meal, my husband tries to keep him entertained but all he wants is to stare at the television and throw his toys. Oh, the toys. The money we spent on toys and all he does is look at them and throw them.  He is not content until every inch of the carpet is covered with toys. The scattering of toys makes it harder for us to stumble over as we rush to pull him from an outlet or from bobbing for bubbles in the potty. After dinner and a bath we begin the bedtime battles.\n \nMatty has decided that he hates bedtime. We used to put him to bed and he would play happily there for sometimes up to an hour before falling asleep. But not anymore. For the last several weeks we lay him down and he cries. Then, he begins to scream. We begin taking turns rocking him. First in the rocking chair, that lasts about two minutes, then up and walking.  We can tag-team this task for up to three hours per night. Or, he falls asleep after only an hour then wakes up later and starts the screaming routine and the tag-team task then takes up to FOUR hours.\n \nNo rest for the weary. The stress of the ordeal has caused me to tear some muscles in my arms. The pain of that rivals the pain of my fibromyalgia and the severe arthritis in my neck. I often do this rocking in tears. But I push on because my husband can only go so far (and he ALWAYS goes too far) before getting short of breath. But, it isn\u2019t all bad. Matty is on a waiting list for day care and if we are still alive in three months, we will finally have a break! We are dangerously close to burning out now. We have no help what-so-ever and we just pray we will make it another three months and that no one will come along and push Matty back on the waiting list.  We are so tired. Our marriage is struggling. Our health is deteriorating. Our hopes are fading.\n\nYou may ask, how does one love a child like this?  Going along with the puzzle that Autism is, \u2026you just do.\n Because of my limited me time, it took four sittings to write this all down.\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/7ffbcf00-5615-4d06-a0dd-c62e35f669f8/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/03/one-long-day.html", "title": "ONE LONG DAY"},
{"date": "Saturday, March 6, 2010", "body": "\n\n\"Mama, I don't LIKE it!\" My JBean wasn't happy.  Although this is not that uncommon, it was still a concern.  The Nutcracker was coming up, and she was due to perform.\n\n\nLast year, she was a flower. \"I liked being a flower mama. Flowers are graceful, and princess-y. It was a pretty dance.\"  This year, she was a lamb. She is less-than-thrilled.  \n\"I hate the Lamb Dance! It's stupid.  The costume is silly, I look like a little kid.\" I figured reminding her that is indeed what she is?  Not so helpful.\n\nEarly on, I told her she didn't have to dance if she didn't want to. The Stage Mother? I am the furthest thing from that person. You won't see me pushing my children against their will. I have a theory about extra-curricular activities: if it isn't fun, what's the point? This may be because I was, if not born with two left feet, in possession of them now. Dancing well is hard for me, and I don't have autism. Still, if I were to try to dance, with actual choreography, you would think I was having a seizure of some sort.\n\nI have given her every opportunity to bow out gracefully. She won't be a prima ballerina; she is still in the first-level class. All of her friends have pretty much moved up a level. She just isn't ready. As a parent, my heart hurts just a little bit for her. I worry as she gets older, girls will make fun of her.  But she won't quit. She assures me that she wants to dance. And she does. She just doesn't love this dance. Still, she is trying, and that's all we can ask. To me, that in itself is a victory. \n\nThis Spring, she again will dance. This time, she will be a rainbow. She will wear a pastel-colored tutu. She wasn't excited about the costume, but she'll get used to it. And I have decided to get her some private lessons to get her \"over the hump.\" I am optimistic that she may improve.  She told me she was passionate about her dancing. I guess it is good to be passionate...do you really have to be good at something to love it?\n\nNow I am looking for a triumph over the fear I have for her. The great, white-hot worry that wakes me at night. I think of the time that is coming, soon, or not-so-soon, when the girls look at her and laugh. When they look at her, whispering behind their hands.  When it hits her just how behind she is, and that without 10,000 hours, she just isn't going to get those dance solos that she may be wanting. She will be tried, and found less than adequate. And though we cannot keep our children from pain, it is still a very difficult thing to watch. A lump in my throat and tears pricking my eyes, I wait.\n\n\nTina has two left feet and the right attitude, usually. Chocolate helps. She also blogs on Send Chocolate Now.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 24, 2010", "body": "\n\n\nI never dreamt I would grow up to be the sort of woman who cries at the drop of a hat. I always despised women who ride a huge rambling rollercoaster of emotion. Keep it to yourself - exercise a little self-control for God\u2019s sake. Now I have joined this emotional little clique. I read an article this morning, sitting on the toilet of course \u2013 where else would I have the time alone to read, and I cried yet again. What was this inspirational topic? Another Hollywood celebrity discussing life with an autistic child. Autism is not selective. People from all walks of life are affected by it. An elite club you do not really know much about until YOU are invited to join. Even now, when a new member is revealed, I cry tears of empathy, grief and relief. I will have another congenial companion on the journey, they will understand. At the same time, my heart breaks for the path I know they will have to tread, the challenges and compromises they will have to consider on a daily basis. \n\nIt is quite ironic emotions erupt from me when the catalyst is a disorder associated with the lack of emotions. I now know that this impression of autism is incorrect. People on the autism spectrum still have the same gamut of feelings but react and reveal them in a different way to the average person. Every child on the spectrum is an individual so the disparities are endless. \n\nHow would I describe my son? He is eccentric, unique, pure, complicated and has Asperger Syndrome. He is emotionally challenging, heart warming, and eminently loveable. My prayers are that he is happy and content in his life. I dream he will marry, have kids, follow his dreams, fulfil his potential. He is angelic of face, volcanic of nature but only those who witness him in full meltdown see those masked eruptive depths. Generally, people use the\u00a0despised phrase: \u201che doesn\u2019t look autistic, does he?\u201d How, exactly, are they meant to look?\n\nFor a parent, those four words: \u201cyour child has autism\u201d is paramount to someone telling you: \u201csorry, you have a terminal disease.\u201d The phrase has a terrifying fatal ring that you did not see coming. Pow, take that. It is ironic that Time magazine nominates autism as the only condition equivalent to cancer in its genetic complexity.\u00a0Initial reaction: it is a joke, right? Not your child, he talks and is loving! Don\u2019t autistic kids sit in a corner barely emoting let alone being verbal? Must be a mistake, they have to be wrong!\n\nYour whole view on life changes, not in a split second, but gradually, little by little, as the implications of this diagnosis kick in. When a child is born, it enters into a world of parent ambitions and dreams. When that child is diagnosed with a disability, it is the parents who grieve for their lost hopes and aspirations. It hits you in stages. Disbelief, grief, acceptance, survival.\u00a0 Like a reformed alcoholic following the Alcoholics Anonymous guidelines, we follow our own AA path: autism awareness.\n\nEnter the minefield of lovely, helpful professionals. Sadly, a high number will bombard you with worse case scenarios accompanied by literature to terrify, or else offer no assistance whatsoever. Expect you to mine through the fields and find the hidden\u00a0cachet of therapies and support. A secret society who will not tell unless the parent unlocks the concealed code. It is only once progressing through the system you learn to become ruthless and track down the rare professional who understands, still retains some compassion in with the professional detachment. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we have encountered some\u00a0wonderful specialists along the way, but why have we needed to fight to find them? We are exhausted by dealing with our children and their issues, and then are expected to have time and energy to intensely research or discover the many alternatives?\n\nAs parents, a pervasive, encompassing loneliness engulfs you. Like two shipwreck survivors, you cling to each other, reassure each other, and sometimes loathe each other. Too down beaten even to try to communicate with external connections, friends fall like flies. The child becomes the centre of your focus \u2013 the marriage just has to coast along under its own steam. Time is in such short supply to even shower seems an unnecessary waste. The internet and its wealth of knowledge becomes a constant lure. Conversation revolves around droplets of information to be shared. No wonder so many frailer marriages implode under the pressure of a special child. Thank God, ours has not. Thank God, we both follow the same path. Thank God, we still love each other enough.\n\nIn the dead of a long, dark night I once wrote:\n\n\u201cWhat can I say to people to let it out? They say how average, normal he seems but they don\u2019t live it. The fights, struggles, mood swings \u2013 his and mine. And the questioning of how much damage I am doing to his brother. How wrong am I getting it? The doubts, anger and frustration of living day to day. The struggle to do normal things like taking a family break. He told me today \u201cI will kill you\u201d and he probably will, somehow, sometime; the heart attack or stroke from the stress, the gun when he is older and angrier\u2026 the alcohol I use to feel better... or not to feel at all. So now I sit, unable to sleep; and type and cry.\u201d \n\nThis is still my reality though not all the time. My son makes me proud in so many of his actions, methods and beliefs. These\u00a0special moment keep me going, hold me\u00a0on the path we have chosen. So many different therapies thrown at you, to pick a direction and stick to it is fraught with uncertainty and doubt. What if it is the wrong choice? What if I am damaging his fragile psyche and another choice would have smoothed his life for him? The consequences could be tragic if we get it wrong. Think Columbine or Arizona Tech. The frustration and isolation that erupt into violence, a newsflash revealing a frozen glimpse of a parent\u2019s greatest fear. My greatest fear. How did their mothers feel? The pain and questioning. What did they do wrong? The unbearable guilt and shame mingling with the overwhelming loss and grief.\n\nI second guess and doubt my choices already. It is easy to feel that a decent mother would be able to fix things for him. No matter how many times I am told otherwise, I often wonder if I did something to cause this. It is so much harder because I swim against conventional thought. MY child. Don\u2019t they get it? MY child. Nobody on this earth understands him the way I do. Not even his father who acknowledges the truly unique, special link I have with my firstborn. His little brother probably understands him well, but still not that iron, heat forged, binding chain we share. Yet I am probably the toughest with him. I have never subscribed to the school of \u201cpoor me, poor him\u201d. I have never allowed the boundaries to differ in relation to both my children. My oldest has to live in the real world, thus he has to learn to cope with the real world. Some mothers think I am harsh. Some mothers think I am obsessive. Some just think I am delusional.\n\nMany education professionals cringe when they see me coming, or if my name is mentioned. One very senior special needs educator said: \u201cyou are an overzealous mother who is causing her child undue anxiety and stress by your attitude. He cannot learn and you will scar him with your belief otherwise\u201d.\u00a0Most present believed he was right. I wonder if that man considered how he was scarring me with that comment. Years later his words still taunt me in the sleepless 2am worry sessions. But time has shown how incorrect they were. If only I had the energy to track them all down to flaunt his school report cards. \n\nThe tragedy is we are meant to rely upon these \u201cspecial\u201d educators, these experts. Those on the front line, the teachers and aides themselves, have allied with us. Former principals pushed boundaries for us. For this, I am so endlessly grateful. They put their hearts into helping my child, but are often bound by the ridiculous ideas and limits placed by the so-called specialists. I despise some of these authority figures. What was it Mark Twain said? \u201cIn the first place God made idiots. This was for practice. Then He made school boards.\u201d \n\nI try not to compare my children. I leave that to the school system. In the household where I grew up, we were treated as individuals. Comparisons were frowned upon, the phrase \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you more like your sister\u201d\u00a0 never uttered. I have always told both my children from birth they are unique, special, different. It is heartbreaking to see the way society likes to knock us all into the same monotonous shape. Especially the\u00a0school system\u00a0\u2013 submit or leave. Comparison is the name of the game. No wonder home schooling is the greatest growing teaching mechanism in the developed nations. I hope both my children survive the educational world with some eccentricities intact. Conform to cope, not to become the round peg. Have the confidence and self-belief to embrace their differences, but still be accepted within mainstream society. \n\nWriting is an ordeal for my son due to his fine motor problems. In this day and age, you would think the system would get it. He will never be comfortable with penmanship, it tires him beyond belief. Most autistic children have low muscle tone, which affects both fine and gross motor skills and it is made more difficult because of the pressure he places upon himself to be flawless. Did I mention that these kids are perfectionists? He prefers to refuse to attempt a task so overwhelming is his fear of failure. This is why I have framed the first Mother\u2019s Day letter he wrote me at six years of age. My close friends cry when they\u00a0read it on my wall.\u00a0They know exactly how hard it had been for him to write this, equivalent to another child writing it in blood. The last line in it is \u201cYou are very special because you always save me from falling.\u201d When questioned about this line, his reply was \u201cyou always save me Mummy, from falling sad, from falling mad, from falling over.\u201d My son. Who believes Mummy will fix anything. I have to live with the knowledge that I will not always be able to save him from falling. I will not always be there when he falls. And so I have to give him the tools to be able to pick himself up, dust himself off, and keep moving. Physically and emotionally. Is it any wonder the pressure pulls me down at times? In my life there is a constant undertow of emotion, ready to drag me under at my first sign of tiring. But if I go down, he goes down, so I swim on.\n\nMy child has the typical autistic sensory issues: smell, touch, taste, sound, sight. Like a superhero, these are fine-tuned to hypersensitivity. Makes for fun on any day, is excruciating on bad days. You know he cannot help it, but it is the whinging that wears you. Oh God, the whinging. If you think all kids whinge, then multiply it by 100 and you have life with an autistic child. These children are the eternal pessimists of life. I think Murphy was autistic (you know \u2013 the one who wrote \u201cwhat can go wrong will go wrong\u201d). \n\nIt is probably why I joyously revel in my child\u2019s cheekiness. To hear my son use sarcasm or throw a witty comeback makes me glow with pride. ASD children do not have usually this ability. Everything in their world is factual and literal. When his teacher says \u201cgood day, no hiccups,\u201d he looks at her in bewilderment. \u201cI didn\u2019t have hiccups today or yesterday or at all last week.\u201d Why would his teacher mention hiccups? He really does not get it. So when I hear him say, \u201cyou punch like a girl\u201d or twist a word for a wholly different meaning I know we are slowly winning the battle. The anthem I can hear in the background right now is music to my ears. \u201cMy brother\u2019s a pinhead, my brother\u2019s a pinhead.\u201d The chant of a champion. We struggle to teach him the things other kids just seem to know as they get older. I do not want him to lose who he is, just make the journey easier throughout life. And to do this he needs skills that others take for granted. If only I could transfer some of his younger brother\u2019s excess to the older.\n\nWhat do autistic children born to demure mothers do? What happens to the children diagnosed with autism whose mothers do not know how to fight? The reserved ones. Do the mothers learn to fight? Do the children become self-sufficient? Or are these the children who fall between the cracks? The system fails them, then Mum does. Future massacre perpetrators. Terrifying. Heartbreaking. Tragic.\n\nI am by nature a doer, but battle has now become a way of life. I fight my son every day. \"Eat breakfast. Please eat breakfast. Son, you will run out of time, eat breakfast. JUST SIT THERE AND EAT BREAKFAST! Get dressed. Please, get dressed. Just get dressed. SON GET DRESSED RIGHT NOW OR I AM TAKING YOU TO SCHOOL NAKED! No Mummy is not trying to cause you stress by yelling. Son brush your \u2026\" Well, you get the idea. Sadly, the biggest campaigns have been waged against those who are meant to be our greatest support. The medical and educational specialists. The burnt out ones, I call them. They look at you as if you are an illiterate idiot, or an obsessive parent in denial. Don\u2019t you understand? Your child has autism, it is not curable! \n\nI know the diagnosis. Disbelief and grief were dealt with and conquered. We had to or the family will remain in an endless limbo. Acceptance and survival are far more complicated, and the impossible is discerning what his reality and potential may be. Exactly who gave these so-called masters a crystal ball? I want one! They are so positive of the outcome for MY child, so definite in their projections. There are so few who understand our plan, who bolster and cheer us on. Give us the positive reinforcement we so crave. Why can\u2019t more of these professionals realise how much we need to hear those few words: \u201cYou have made the right choice.\u201d It is not that hard to say!\n\nI do NOT accept the restrictions and the doubt imposed on my child\u2019s abilities. I know what he is capable of. I am aware that many things will not develop with maturity and age if we do not intervene now. Therefore we do. We give him the grounding he needs to become a happy, fulfilled adult. Teach him to use his own judgement to overcome the obstacles. To make the best choices, not the worst. He has already far surpassed what these people predicted for him in the early years.\n\nThe internet becomes addictive\u00a0when you have a child diagnosed with autism. I grasp onto little bits and pieces, ideals and ideas, beliefs and gut instinct. Weave them into our lives. Our path. Our way. Our desire to help him be whoever and whatever he chooses. OUR WAY. The World Wide Web can be your greatest resource or the most insidious tool in the universe. Who was it who said, \u201cA little knowledge is a dangerous thing\u201d? So true. The search for information and ideas can backfire when you stumble\u00a0onto the horror stories\u00a0from armchair experts who prophesize doom and gloom for the child. \n\nI have a signature underneath my username. \u201cPlease don\u2019t annoy me, I\u2019m running out of places to hide the bodies\u2026\u201d The original was actually a bit stronger than this, but I adapted it to be a little more politically correct. Just to warn some people I meet on the internet highway that I am a lioness protecting her cub, the warrior queen using my wit to take down any enemies. \nIt is terribly amusing that I am writing all this. Baring my soul, ripping off the scab from my heart. I try not to ramble on too much about him. People\u2019s eyes glaze when I am spilling too much. Therefore, I do not. It just seethes in the pit of my stomach until I get through it, or until I purge it all on the internet to my close coven of friends facing the same battles. Yes, we do actually call ourselves a coven or sometimes a clique. A clique where nobody ever has to fight for membership. A group of emotionally turmoiled mothers grasping hands, baring souls, trying to bandaid the wound. I sit, and again I cry. This time with gratitude that these special women get it. I can stop fighting and breathe. Just for a moment.\n\n otherwise known as Tanya is an Aussie blogaholic.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 24, 2010", "body": "\nPart 1:\n\nWhen our first child was born, we were the same as most\u00a0new parents: filled with love, hope, joy and dreams for our son. Little did we know that God had planned a very different journey for us. Far from the smooth highway we veered onto the rugged back roads and broken dusty trails. The first of the section is fact. The second part,\u00a0in blue italics, contains the less rational emotional journey.\n\n\n\nThe Early Years Birth to Three Years of Age:\n\nHigh Blood Pressure last trimester - medically controlled\u00a0by Labetalol. My mother-in-law suffers a cerebral haemorrhage when I am thirty weeks pregnant. We travel interstate to see her and land smack bang into family politics, making life nasty and hellish. On our return, my previously perfect blood pressure has skyrocketed through the roof. Rushed off to BP specialist and medicated. Weekly visits. Informed it is MY BP, not pre-eclampsia.\nAdmitted\u00a0seven days overdue, blood pressure dangerously high again. Controlled, induced ten days over. Twenty-four hour labour, attempted forceps, foetal distress, meconium passed not inhaled, emergency caesarean section. Blue baby. Apgar four at birth, nine at five minutes. I cope, after all that is what women do. I have run the gauntlet and survived, and so I cope. And thank God for a brilliant obstetrician without whom we both would not have survived.\nSlightly jaundiced baby. All well within 24 hours. He is cute, but I am waiting for this overwhelming rush of maternal love. It finally kicks in around Day 3, about the same time as my milk. And the tears. Then I get mastitis. Twice. Gotta love this gig.\nEarly childhood nurse picks up torticollus and craniosynostosis (or cranial stenosis as it was back then). Turns out he was wedged like a cork in my pelvis the last trimester which resulted in weakened muscles on one side of his neck, tightened on the other. Craniosynostosis/Craniostenosis is when premature synostosis of cranial bone sutures occurs, normal head growth is inhibited. Various characteristic anomalies of the head develop as a result, and in extreme cases, the development of the brain and sensory organs is hindered. Google is not my friend. My baby may have to have the sutures in his skull cut open. His forehead is pushed forward on the left and his skull is flattened\u00a0at the rear. His brain is being crowded. He screams in terror when they lock his head into position to take an x-ray. I cry.\nBy twelve months old, (when I am two months pregnant) we are given the all clear. Physiotherapy, posturing, tummy time\u00a0and sleeping position regulating has strengthened his neck muscles, allowed the pressure to be relieved on the flattened plate of his skull, and the bones to realign. It is pure luck that the plates have not fused. We rejoice that our gorgeous boy does not need surgery on his delicate skull. I did not know how I was going to handle it if they had said \"surgery\". All the tears when we made him lie on the side he was not comfortable in, all the battles when he tried to roll to the other flat side were worth it. He is going to be okay.\nHe starts saying words quite young. The ECN does not believe he is saying \"Mama\" at four months, she says he is babbling \"Mumumumumumu\". Until he does it in front of her. Until he deliberately and clearly calls Mama when I leave the room. Looks for me. Waits. Then yells quite annoyed: \"MAMA!\" She also denies the night terrors in a child under 12 months old. So we video them. Again she admits her mistake. By twelve months, he has over thirteen words including a favourite: cheesestick. Sentences are being formed. He is a joy, and apparently quite forward in his speech according to the ECN. But he is lagging in the physical development side, but we are told not to worry.We can only stop the terrors by latching him onto the breast. I feed to thirteen months when I am nearly through my first trimester and sick as a dog.\nHe is a very Mum focused child. Clingy, but a happy, laughing boy with it. Sleeps through except for night terrors sometimes. Captivates many with his engaging smile. Loves blowing raspberries to strange women over Dad's shoulder. He has the best laugh and an infectious giggle. Hubbie could have had lots of phone numbers with this one as his wingman. So engaging, he loves people. Had the whole plane playing peek-a -boo on one of our flights north. I think he is used to being with me,\u00a0which is why he cries on the rare times he is not.\nCommando crawls from 5 months, crawls on knees 11 months, finally walks 17 months. Finally! Thought I would be carrying two babies around. ECN says the lateness is nothing to worry about.\nLoves being a big brother. Constantly monitoring adventurous Boy 2. He loves his baby. Sits and chats whilst I feed Boy 2. Never a hint of jealousy, none of the anger or tantrums we were told to expect. Is very protective of his little brother.\nSensitive little man, is upset if people yell or argue. Does not like loud noises but is not exposed to them often.\nAt\u00a0almost three he begins to change. Coincidentally it occurs\u00a0with his MMR injection. He becomes extremely attached to me screaming whilst I shower. His speech\u00a0changes to an \u00a0indistinct, slurred, monotone. Obsessions come out and\u00a0eye contact is avoided. Meltdowns run for up to two hours. My child vanishes and a new one is revealed.\u00a0The doctor later says it is at this age that these signs emerge. I am lost in a fog of grief. After a long battle my Dad has lost his fight with cancer. I am not mothering my children, I am merely managing. The baby sitter mentions autism. I tell her to mind her own business, silly little know it all. My son is nothing like Rainman.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis is the beginning of our journey, in my heart I knew something was wrong but could not face it. As my grief grew more manageable, I started look at the issues. My first concern was his speech problems, and the unexplained changes. It was to be my starting point.\n\n\n\n\u00a0 also blogs at Meaninless Meandering From a Madmother.

{"date": "Thursday, March 25, 2010", "body": "\nWell little Zachary has had a rough few weeks but the other day was a real woozie. I seriously thought his screaming and meltdowns couldn\u2019t get any worse. It did. On our way home from school Friday I pulled out of the kiss n\u2019 ride and he started crying about his seat belt not feeling right. Joshua who knows all to well when things \u201cdon\u2019t feel right\u201d tried fixing his belt. The screaming and crying got louder as he complained it was twisted. It wasn\u2019t. But to a child on the spectrum it doesn\u2019t matter if we don\u2019t see it twisted. He feels it and can\u2019t cope. Just before we got to our house Joshua adjusted it again. I park the car in the driveway and all hell breaks loose as he starts screaming for me to turn around and go back we have to start all over. He kicks the seat infront of his and gets hysterical when I tell him we can\u2019t go back.\n\nI will let you in on a secret. When Joshua was about the same age if I did not take the exact route home every day the same thing would occur and he would beg through his screaming and tears to please go back and start again because it wasn\u2019t right. This was before I knew anything was wrong and felt as though I somehow did something to distress my own child that yes, I would actually turn around and start all over just so I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with a two hour meltdown. Thankfully gas was cheaper then!\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes of Zachary still in the car hitting me, screaming and refusing to let me take his seat belt off I finally got him into the house where he screamed, ripped up a picture he had done in school, and then ran out of the house screaming for me to take him back and start again. I brought him back in only to have a meltdown of swearing, throwing things, hitting me, scratching, jumping up and down and begging me to please take him back. Finally he was exusted after about an hour of this and started banging his head on the chair as he rocked back and forth with his blankie. My 6 year old daughter Arielle and 7 year old son Sebastian were happy he finally had stopped and came downstairs out of hiding.\n\nIt can be difficult some days - okay most days - but as my little Ryley continued to sleep through it all, and my other 4 sat around Zachary (not too close of course) to listen as I read Zaks library book \u201cFranklin and the dark\u201d I realized that I couldn\u2019t have asked for 6 better children.Related articles by ZemantaLiam Knows what to do when Kids Act Snitty, by Jane Whelen Banks (whitterer-autism.blogspot.com)Breaks, Guilt, & Illness (squidalicious.com)\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://whitterer-autism.blogspot.com/2010/03/liam-knows-what-to-do-when-kids-act.html", "http://www.squidalicious.com/2010/03/breaks-guilt-illness.html", "http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/a31fc1a6-f64d-4daf-83c2-da6b196206d4/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/03/pleasescream-louder.html", "title": "Please....scream louder"},
{"date": "Monday, March 22, 2010", "body": "\nToday I cried.  I had finally had it.  Having children on the spectrum really sucks, and I have gone on for so long with just \u201cdealing with it\u201d every day that it finally happened.  Mummy meltdown.  Not to have a poor pity me session but seriously it was bound to happen.  How long did I think I could actually go on here with 6 children, no help, and two on the spectrum?\n\nGranted there are other children who have far worse disabilities, but here in this household it is bad enough.  The worse thing about having a child on the spectrum is that the do not look like they have a disability.  They look so typical.  But back to the mummy meltdown.  It was probably brewing over March break as each child came down with a nasty stomach bug, one after the other.  So when it was back to school today I was glad to be back into the regular routine.  \n\nHowever, my Joshua had a rough time getting back into the school thing and didn\u2019t want to go.  I finally managed to get him into the truck and over to the school, but once there he put up a terrible fight and wouldn\u2019t get out.  I had to call out the VP who fortunately for me is a great guy and totally gets Joshua.  So after about 15 minutes of Joshua screaming, kicking, hitting and trying to run off, the VP managed to get him under control and into the school and so I left.\n\nThen I cried.  Hard.  The flow of tears felt like it would never end.  For half an hour I allowed myself to scream \u201cwhy me?\u201d  I allowed myself to yell at all those ignorant people who claim Autism can be cured by diet, or other things that only give us parents false hope. I allowed myself to feel the guilt and shame that comes along when my son chases the garbage man in his truck down the street screaming for him to give back his stuff, or when he has violent outbursts, or when he has a meltdown in the grocery store.  I allowed myself to feel guilty about not being able to spend more quality time with my 4 typical children because Zak and Josh require me 24 / 7.  I allowed myself to be me, not the supermom people think that I am.\n\nThen I stopped.  Wiped away the tears.  I am a wife, a bitch and the biggest advocate for all of my children.  I am a momof6 who only has time to feel sorry for herself for about half an hour, once a month or so.

I don't know. \u00a0I haven't been tested. \u00a0But deep down in there, I really honestly could have Asperger's Syndrome. \u00a0That idea\u00a0freaks me out, so I don't go there very often. It makes me somewhat sick to think about it.\n\nWhich brings me to my son. \u00a0He is 13. \u00a0That 3-word sentence gives you lots of information: obsessed, moody, depressed, temper, overwhelmed, lonely, sad, manic. \u00a0Other offerings I can give are: singing all Beatles all the time, creating new and 'exciting' Star Wars stories and reciting them to everyone he sees, on medications for abrupt and intense mood changes (are you shocked?) and pretty severe death wishes. \n\nBoth of my kids were brought up in public school until last spring 2009. \u00a0My daughter (8) has some unidentified educational quirks that we are trying to figure out. \u00a0My son was getting beaten and the school policy was not helping. \u00a0The environment in middle school 'sucks' for almost everyone, but for aspies, it's torture.\n\nObviously since I am homeschooling, I'm not overly concerned about conforming to societal norms. \u00a0I don't NEED him to perform everything that I would expect of another son. \u00a0I never did. \u00a0I was concerned with his happiness, and my own sanity in providing that. \u00a0My aunt's philosophy with her aspie son is different. \u00a0She has pretty much pushed him through the door of various sports teams, and held the door shut while he struggled to get out. \u00a0He eventually performs, but I've rarely seen him smile. \u00a0My oldest brother-in-law (aspie) was raised somewhere in between, but he is now 48 years old, so it was a different environment altogether.\n\nI do have hopes for him for the future. \u00a0These expectations are small and specific and vary day to day. \u00a0For instance, I hope he will grasp the principles of writing various forms of papers this coming school year, so he can go to college. \u00a0I hope he is able to keep the few friends he has. \u00a0I'd like him to successfully attend New Tech High when the time comes. \u00a0None of my plans for him go beyond a few years time. \u00a0How can they? \n\nWe're a pretty religious family, and I know Heavenly Father loves him. \u00a0I have seen evidence of that in gifts, in \u00a0little miracles. \n\nBut I am tired. \u00a0I am worried. \u00a0I struggle to be a good parent to both of my kids, but I especially feel that I could easily fail. \u00a0Asperger's sucks because we don't live in my happy place. \u00a0Because I am not perfect and perfectly consistent and perfectly sane all of the time. \u00a0I know what you're saying---\"you're doin' fine, don't expect perfection, it'll be okay.\" \u00a0Whatever. \u00a0Hopefully, someone is thinking, I understand her feelings. \u00a0I need that probably most of all. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/03/bit-of-vent.html", "title": "A bit of a vent..."},

We are all working multiple jobs right now and are stretched to the max. We're crabby, tired, and our patience is running thin. \n\nI had a meltdown last week. I teach on Thursday night and when I came home, there were dishes galore. To add insult to injury, my SIL left for a weekend work trip and her skanky lunch dishes were waiting in the sink for somebody (aka ME) to clean up. \n\nOn Friday afternoon, I calmly told my husband that I felt I was being taken advantage because we're all stretched, yet I'm the one doing the majority of the work with the kids and cleaning the house, doing the laundry, etc. Then I told him he and his sister needed to work out a schedule where they took responsibility for emptying and loading the dishwasher so that there would be one consistent task that would be off my to-do list. He agreed.\n\nSecretly (here's where the experiment comes in), I have decided that I will not unload the dishwasher until after Mother's Day. I will only load my dishes, the kids dishes, and any dishes I use to prepare food. If the dishwasher is clean and unemptied, I'll hand wash our dishes (mine and the kids). I'm finding that handwashing right away is actually taking less time than the loading/unloading dishwasher route. \n\nI realize that doing this secretly is a bit unfair, but in my defense, I asked for them to help out and they agreed. This is just my way of measuring results. It also gives me something to do in place of constantly asking them(and/or bitching at them)to hold up their end. I do enough reminding with the kids.\n\nSo far, there is a full dishwasher that's been washed twice because yesterday my SIL put a bunch of dirty dishes in, then decided after I told her they were clean that she'd just rewash because hey, that's the least lazy option.\n\nNow there sits about 1/3 sinkful of dirty dishes, a dishwasher that has been clean for a day and a half, and dirty dishes from my husband and SIL, who from here on out will be referred to as The Others.\n\nI'll keep you all posted on the experiment.

I have twins, one high functioning and one low functioning. My low functioning son has run me through the gamit \u2013 last year we discovered he is an eloper, after jumping the fence and being found on the 91 freeway. He also jumped his grandparent's fence and was found on the Los Alamitos Army reserve Base. Now 13, he is in the middle of adolescence and has discovered masturbation. Yes, this is one topic where there is no help out there, on the internet or from doctors. People don't want to talk about it, but if you have a low functioning child who is not developed enough to ejaculate, he will pee, and pee everywhere. Behavioral therapists tell us to do social stories, which he memorizes but doesn't generalize. You can't take his reinforcer away \u2013 it's built in. We try to tell him that shower time is the time he can do that \u2013 the kid takes 20 \u2013 30 minute showers now. Lucky kid - I'm lucky if I get 5 minutes. In fact, this morning, while I was taking that 5 minute shower, he did it again and peed all over the floor. The doctor is raising his prozac dosage, but doesn't have hopes that it will calm his behavior \u2013 it might make a 50 year old man less interested, but it's doubtful it will have that effect on a 13 year old boy. But we will try, because at this point, we will try anything. He mainly does this at night, when everyone is asleep, so there's no chance at redirecting his behavior. He will play with himself, then pee over the side of the bed, down the wall, and onto the floor. I discovered this when his room began to smell, but I couldn't find anything obvious \u2013 his bed is a loft bed against the wall, and there are baskets of toys and things under it. Only when I got down on the floor did I discover that there was a veritable flood of pee, the carpet was soaked beyond ruin, and the hardwood floors underneath were beginning to get moldy.\n\nAs they boys get older, I find myself wishing that just for a day, I had typical kids, and if that wasn't possible, wishing that everyone else had low functioning autistic kids, just so they'd really know what I go through.\n\nwritten by a mom who wishes to remain anonymous, based on subject matterRelated articles by ZemantaLife With Autism - A Mother's Perspective (autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com)Life in an Autistic World - II (autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com)Life in an Autistic World - I (autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com)2009: The Year I Maybe Could Have Done Without, Or Not (califmom.com)\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.califmom.com/califmom/2010/01/2009-the-year-i-maybe-could-have-done-without-or-not.html", "http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/d371b658-a195-4443-bc04-89501f65e766/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/04/itll-get-easier.html", "title": "It'll Get Easier?"},
{"date": "Sunday, April 25, 2010", "body": "\n I started reading this blog when I first learned that autism sucks. Which was about 3 months before my son, nicknamed Moe, was finally diagnosed. That was almost a year ago. It still sucks.This weekend we had my daughter's first birthday party. I couldn't stand the thought of more people invading my home (10 therapists a week is enough, thank you), so we had the party at Gymboree. I thought it would be fun and involve no work. I though that Moe would have a good time too. He's into climbing everything right now so that would be good. And he used to love it there when he was a baby and we had time to do things other than therapy.Well, guess what? Autism sucks because it is unpredictable. Moe had a major meltdown the moment we stepped in the door. Fortunately, none of the other guests had arrived and he calmed down in a few minutes. He spent his time on the outside, bouncing on the trampoline in the corner or running around the edges with a juice box. Didn't even participate when it was time for bubbles or the parachute. For a while he obsessed over the drinking fountain until he couldn't find anyone to pick him up anymore. He exhausted his grandparents who were kind enough to chase him around the room so my husband and I could spend a little time with our daughter who is going to be one year old and deserved a day all to herself. So we could watch her eat her first bite of cake.We call her Jelly Belly. She doesn't have a lot of friends of her own. We know a lot of people Moe's age, leftover from the playdates we used to be able to attend. They came, and some of them have baby brothers and sisters now, so they came too. Family and old friends came and there was a nice crowd. But any time the group gets together, I'm reminded of how different he is and we are. I'm reminded how much I love three year olds and how they talk and how they follow each other around the room in packs, looking already like teenagers. I'm reminded of how I've been robbed of that time with my little boy.I'm reminded of how much autism sucks.Jen writes about life with a baby girl and an almost three year old son with autism on her personal blog, Anybody Want a Peanut?

Law The fact of having been found to have violated a criminal law; legal culpability.\nc. Responsibility for a mistake or error.\n2. a. Remorseful awareness of having done something wrong.\nb. Self-reproach for supposed inadequacy or wrongdoing.\n\nAnd then there is Mother's GUILT. An altogether far more powerful and irrational emotion. Mother's Guilt means we take on every let down and disappointment in our children's lives as our own. Mother's Guilt (MG) amplifies our feelings of inadequacy and makes us question our judgement. Mother's Guilt is responsible for our self recrimination and our feelings of blame and well, guilt, for our children's issues.\n\nI doubt there is a mother alive who has not questioned herself or uttered those words to herself: \"Did I do something to cause this?\"\n\nAnd as strong as we feel at times, there will always be times when the old MG kicks back in and we worry about our choices, our family unit, and especially our different kids.\n\nI am drowning in the sea of Mother's Guilt at the moment. With Boy 1 hitting the terrifying section of the ASD rollercoaster track known as puberty we are facing a whole new set of challenges previously unseen. With me hitting peri-menopause Mother's Guilt takes on a whole new dimension and removes the calm anchor my firstborn relies on during the storms.\n\nPut into the equation a younger Boy 2, only nineteen months behind Boy 1, bearing the brunt of all this emotional turmoil from both directions, plus being chastised at school for things well beyond his control such as arriving late after a horror Boy 1 morning...\n\nAnd I am drowning in Mother's Guilt.\u00a0 \n\nReally should not have read \"House Rules\" by Jodi Picoult whilst in this vulnerable frame of mind.

I've noticed that from your records that it's been awhile since you've been in for a cleaning. In fact, it's been three years. Are you with another dentist? If so, let me know and I'll stop calling. If not, we'd really like to see you....\"\n\n\nUrgh. \n\n\nAnd that's how it goes. No dentist for three years (yes, gross I know and I am surprised that I don't look that the poor person in the picture above). No physicals in a little over two years. No mammogram in two years. Can't remember the last eye exam (early 2000's?) and the \"womanly\" exam, maybe a few years back (I think but can't remember). I was supposed to get an MRI on my back (missed the appointment). Had to cancel with an acupuncturist three times (can't remember why I booked an acupuncturist in the first place). This is me: Autism Mom who misses and struggles with appointments. And mightily. \n\n\nHere's the rub: I have insurance coverage. I can actually go and take care of myself. I also have caregivers, now and again, that can manage my PDD son (however, this tends to be spontaneous and frankly, if I get an \"out of jail\" free card, I certainly don't want to be sitting in a dental chair having my teeth scraped). \n\n\nHow do you solve this problem? \n\n\nI mean, when I can secure a caregiver, or attempt to book an appointment during school hours, my worry list comes out. Here it is: \n\nWill my child throw such a tremendous fit, that I won't be able to leave? \n\nWill that child refuse to go with the caregiver I've selected? Then the fit. \n\nWill the child cause such an uproar at school that the school will call wanting  me to come get him? \n\nWill I be so stressed out that I won't remember the appointment even though I've received reminder calls and texts and that I wrote it down on the calendar? \n\n\nAnd, my friends, all four of these things have happened to me, regretfully. A lot.\n \n\nThere was a day were I used to take care of those things. Yes! My son is eleven now, but we never got a diagnosis until eight, and then things really got flared up at age nine. But before that, I could go and do (unless my only laziness or selfishness got in the way, but that's ME that sucks, not autism that sucks). \n\n\nSo, I've declared May APPOINTMENT MONTH (and unofficially Autism PARENT Awareness month)! I am planning even as I write! \n\n\nOf course, advice, tips, and tricks, well, they are always welcome. Needed. Okay, help! How do the rest of you get this stuff done? \n\nKim Thompson is the blogger/moderator/founder of Gritty City Woman (a mash up of all things gritty and womanly) and is a contributing blogger for In Your Neighborhood with The Tacoma News Tribune newspaper. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_3XZh4yWgpUM/S9n3Xmofv6I/AAAAAAAAARo/qKDgUMdiU-Q/s1600/bxp27155.jpg", "http://grittycitywoman.blogspot.com/", "http://inyourneighborhood.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/04/dentists-and-docs-autism-no-show-no-go.html", "title": "Dentists and Docs, Autism, No Show, No Go"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 5, 2010", "body": "\n\n\nBreak out the neck brace, I\u2019ve suffered whiplash, autism style. Autism whiplash is a phenomenon in my household where my 11 year old PDD son has a \u201cgood streak\u201d and then it turns bad on a dime. What constitutes a \u201cgood streak?\u201d This is when there are LESS issues than normal and/or the issues that are experienced have a QUICK resolution. I mean, really, with autism, I\u2019ve never had an issue free day with my son. However, if it\u2019s a soft day, with less, that\u2019s terrific.  A good streak can last a day or two, maybe a week or two! Once I got the royal treatment with nearly a month! Wow! So, this is a good thing so far, right? Yep, and this is where the autism gives me a gut punch. We are rolling along well and BAM! It\u2019s like getting rear-ended in a car without warning.   Case in point. My son has a great deal of difficulty setting foot in the school\u2019s threshold to start his day. Between the anxiety and quick anger, it is an ordeal. But sometimes, school CAN go smoothly. So, recently, my son had a good streak with getting to school and he was doing pretty well staying there. This had been for a week. My husband and I also noticed that he was having really good behavior at home (more cooperative, helpful, kind). We were feeling pretty good and hopeful. So, one day my husband took my son to school. This is a big treat for my son (because usual my husband is at work and can\u2019t take him). My son adores his father and tends to behave a lot better for him, than me. So, hubby takes our boy over to school. Things are going well and the conversation is upbeat. Dad delivers son to teacher and notices that son has an odd look on his face. Without warning, our son attacks his father in front of school staff, starts hitting, and calls his father dirty names and was viciously verbally abusive. My husband was horrified (this rarely happens to him) and removed our son from school. Bad streak ensues. Exhaustion sets in. Hope sinks. Whiplash. The autism has pulled this trick on my son and our family on and off this week. Good streak and then snap, it\u2019s broken. Usually it comes on quick and strong. Let\u2019s discuss. How do you fellow warriors cope with whiplash? How do you swim in the muck of a let-down?\n\nKim Thompson's blog, Gritty City Woman, is dedicated to bring out the grittiness in all of us!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_3XZh4yWgpUM/S-JJ2jaWxrI/AAAAAAAAASg/dgBcXtHBExA/s1600/neck_brace.png", "http://grittycitywoman.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/05/whiplash.html", "title": "Whiplash!"},

Last friday he had a monumental meltdown when we dropped them back home after school and he couldn't go in to play. So this morning I thought that I would prep him early about picking them up in the morning and then dropping them home in the afternoon. There, my friends, began the negotiations...\n\n\"Can I go in to play at their house after school?\"\n\n\"Not really mate, your sister has dance this afternoon\"\n\n\"ARGH, I HATE going to dance! I don't want to go there and sit around and wait, I want to play at their house\"\n\nOn and On it went until finally a compromise was reached. He can play for half an hour (while his sister goes to dance with another Mum) and then we will go there to pick her up at the end. This hopefully will be compromise enough for him.\n\nSo we pick the boys up from home and I pull into the drop off zone at school and out they jump. The boys run off and K drops his jacket. As he stops to pick it up they have run into the school without a backward glance.\n\nThere stood my son, looking at the school, looking back at me and then......eruption!\n\n\"I DON'T want to go to school today! this is a no school day for me! NO, I DON'T WANT TO GO!\" \nFor 5 minutes I put him inside the gate only for him to exit it again screaming at me. Yelling things like, \"I don't want to go to the DUMB school and learn the DUMB lessons\" . Parents shuffled past us. Some hugging their children closer as they made a wide girth around us. One Mum offered to take him, tried to talk to him but he was too far gone, I thanked her for the offer as I struggled to hold him to me.\n\nHe threatened to run away. He got out of my grasp and he ran! I ran and caught him. I couldn't take the kids out of the car, his sister did not have socks on and brother no shoes. We were only meant to drop him off and then come home. So what could I do?\n\nI took him to the car, we drove to the office and I got his teacher to come and get him. As she asked if he was ok I mentioned the threat of running away, I asked her to watch him today. He was never ever done anything like this before. Never tried to run away, never refused to go to school like this.\n\nI have no idea what is going on with him. Perhaps it is the middle of the term and he is hitting his coping limit for school? I don't know, but I wish that someone would pass the manual this way so I could work it out! The recent increase and intensity of meltdowns/ tantrums and now threatening to run away.....what is next? :( My son K was diagnosed with Aspergers middle of last year, he is 6 years old.

But it's also just...life. Every time I sit down to put my thoughts on paper, some crisis hits and I have to break out the proverbial fire hose or do recon. I have so much to say, but I cannot get my thoughts in order. Chaos reigns supreme in my house. As I write this, my youngest child is sitting here alternating between, \"I don't care what you say!\" over and over again, and \"EVIL!\" and just screaming.  There is only so much that you can listen to this before you start to tune it out.  And don't tell me to try to make it better, nothing does.  It is Monday, after a particularly busy weekend, and this is par for the course.  Albeit, a little louder than usual. Such is autism in my house.\n\nAs I write this, my son is in his room egging his sister's behavior on, and trying to see how far he can push me. He is supposed to be writing an essay, but unless I stand on his neck, figuratively speaking, that's not going to happen today. He just slithered past behind the couch thinking I didn't know he was there. Now, he is making faces at his sister. Again, he thinks I don't know. I am about ready to pounce on him so we can work on his double-digit multiplication, so he is trying to maintain a low profile.\n\nI had to resume this post after I dealt with JBean. She was out of control. Hitting me and throwing Legos, not enough to hurt, but enough to be really annoying. I finally picked her up and deposited her in her bed, with her screaming, \"You're hurting me! I really wasn't she was just overly sensitive.  I tucked her into bed, with her weighted blanket, including her arms.  Think: swaddling a baby to calm them. I sat next to her with my legs over her, not my weight, just my legs. She was screaming, but I know her well enough to know what calms her.\n\nAfter a bit, she was quiet, and I could see the comprehension shine in her eyes once again. I picked up the closest stuffed animal, which happened to be a multi-colored patchwork elephant, and told her to hold him.  Then I asked her what color she was feeling.  She pointed to red. \"So you are angry?\" She nodded her head. I told her it was good that she could tell me how she was feeling. Then I pointed to white. \"This is peace.  It's a good feeling, and if you add it to the red, you can end up with pink. Do you think you could be pink?\"  She nodded, her eyes wide. \"I could try, \" she said.\n\nThen she pointed at purple. \"What's that, \" I asked.  \"it's 'I'm Sorry,\" she said.\n\nAnd she was.\n\nCrisis averted, peace restored. At least until lunchtime, anyway.\n\nBut this?  Is why I can't write.\n\nTina writes on her own blog, Send Chocolate Now! and is a featured blogger at OC Family,and Orange County Moms Blog.

What kinds of illustrations do you give, analogies do you form, comparisons do you come up with?\nDo you ever run through a typical day with someone who is learning about your life, whether they are close to you or not? What is the reaction? What is the response from them?\nMy take? I explain that with an autistic child there are issues every day. Every day. Some days may be very mild and not a big deal. Others may exhaust. And some others may crush your soul. There's lots of emotions, good and bad, and there's lots of things you must remember and think about. It's not organized or predictable, necessarily. I could (and sometimes do) go further than this with specifics. \nI also share the positive stuff. I mean, I have two great kids!

Recently, in perusing the cyber world on autism issues, I am seeing more and more adults on the spectrum themselves, that say that using the phrases high functioning and neurotypical, are not appropriate, and even, offensive. Hmm...The reason stated is that if you are considered high functioning you are NOT autistic but have some other condition. The argument for neurotypical is that NO ONE is neurotypical. We all have anomalies, differences, however small. No one has the perfect brain. So, my question: so then, what are we supposed to say? Are there some new words out there that I am missing? \n\n2. Does anyone have the beat on the pulse of actual autism statistics? How many people are affected? I see numbers all over the map! What is the most accurate? When people ask me, I'm kinda taking a guess. \n\n3. I am a part-time homeschooling parent (well really, we tend more towards the unschooling). Just looking for words of inspiration I suppose.

Sure, we had (and still have) the occasion rough night for teething or stuffy noses, but most nights they slept twelve hours a night. My kids were good sleepers.  I tried not to brag about it at mom's groups meetings and playdates. While others were talking about their sleep issues, I tried to keep quiet about how good I had it. I would offer suggestions as to what we did, trying to sympathize but also feeling like there must be something they were doing wrong - something we somehow did better. Well, ladies, it's payback time.  The sleep monster has struck our house, and good. It started about 6 months ago. Moe, my 3 year old with ASD, started waking up in the middle of the night. We'd hear him playing, often giggling. He'd stay up for an hour or maybe two, and would eventually fall back asleep. I was a little concerned because it made it harder for him to wake up in time for his 8 am therapy sessions, but by the time I consulted with our OT on some strategies to help him get back to sleep, he had grown out of it.  Then, about a month or so ago, Moe started to have some trouble falling asleep. The behavior was similar. He'd giggle and shriek in his crib. He was clearly over-stimulated and it started taking longer and longer for him to fall asleep, sometimes up to three or four hours. Again, this made for difficult mornings. We consulted with our OT, made sure we had a 30 minute wind down bedtime routine, tried the calming techniques. Nothing worked, and after consulting with our doctor, started him on melatonin before bed. It works like a charm at helping him fall asleep.  Relief! Problem sovled! Right? Right?? Wrong. Now we have a new problem. Moe is once again waking up in the middle of the night and having trouble falling asleep. On three separate occasions - enough to qualify as a trend in my book - he has been up for over five hours. Yes, dear readers, my once-was-a-great-sleeper child is waking up at midnight and not falling asleep until five in the morning. I feel like I have a newborn again. I'm so tired I can barely remember my name.  Everything is worse when we are tired. Moe's behaviors increase and speech decreases. My patience and ability to look at things with any measure of perspective goes out the window. I crave chocolate chip cookies. It gets harder for me to hide the bags under my eyes. It isn't pretty. Oh, cruel and vengeful gods of sleep, I beseech you. I am at your mercy. Please, let this pass.  Jen is thankful for a full night's sleep last night (Kaynahorah puh puh puh, knock on wood).

A couple of bruises, scratches or some other boo-boo, or someone yelling nasty words at you constantly?\n\nI\u2019ll take the bruises, scratches, and boo-boos, thank you very much.\n\nIn the early days of my son\u2019s diagnosis, he became a bit of a hitter and kicker. I was typically the targeted punching bag (he rarely did this stuff to others; thank God as it was bad enough for me and my husband, so fortunately no one else was in the mix). At 11, he\u2019s grown far better with this physical behavior. It still stirs the autism pot once and awhile, but thankfully it\u2019s short lived and medication evens the playing field.\n\nLast week, though, in a tantrum moment (worst we\u2019d had in some time), I took a hit in the face, like a slap. It wasn\u2019t too bad and when my son came out of his autism world and took a trip to my world when the anger haze lifted, he was overly apologetic and remorseful. I appreciated the apology, but I still felt worn down, beat up, and dirty.\n\nIt\u2019s the words.\nMy kid\u2019s words feel like getting hit full blast with sharp-cornered bricks. They hurt worse than a slap, that\u2019s for sure. And it\u2019s not the typical smarting off, backtalk, or pre-adolescent crankiness. Nope, this ranks right up there with pure verbal abuse (laced with some God awful expletives). Again, I am the punching bag here as well (Dad gets some too, but I am the primary caregiver during the week, so I take more sadly). We work really hard with him on dealing with this vitriol with a variety of techniques we\u2019ve learned from his medical and educational teams (and former family counselors, I say former because my kid refuses to get behavioral therapy and pitches a fit in their offices). Regardless of the trying everything including total honesty ( I feel hurt when you say those things, here\u2019s why, etc.) it doesn\u2019t work. \nIn the meantime, I am feeling physically and mentally exhausted. Mind you, I don\u2019t have this every day. But enough. Even if it\u2019s just once during a period of a couple weeks or a month, it\u2019s ENOUGH.\n\nSome relatives took my son recently for a long outing (of course he\u2019s an angel with them). I did not miss him. I did not think of him. And I don\u2019t feel an ounce of guilt for saying that. And I don\u2019t feel bad I said this in an open, public forum either.\n\nRant off. Thank you.\n\nCome visit my tired but trying to have fun self and get down to the nitty gritty with me right HERE.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_3XZh4yWgpUM/S_yH2rKt2YI/AAAAAAAAAVg/jfdnt9ESNao/s1600/tired_woman.jpg", "http://grittycitywoman.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/05/punching-bag.html", "title": "Punching Bag"},

{"date": "Sunday, June 13, 2010", "body": "\nLike many 11 year old\nboys, my son loves to ride his bike. He loves the freedom of the road,\nthe challenge of finding cool neighborhood bike routes, and the wind in\nhis face. Biking is his ultimate freedom . And that freedom includes\nneighborhood rides to the sports card and memorabilia shop and the\nlocal park. Great exercise, exploring one's community, and catching\nsome sunshine was the goal for Saturday, isn't that enough? \n\nApparently, for some bullies in a car, it was not enough.\n\nAs my son\nwaited on his bike at the light on a busy street close to our home,\nsome teen boys in a car yelled at my son, called him names, and pelted\nmelted cupcakes at him. \n\nWhat were those\nkids thinking? I think I know. I suspect it went something like this:\n\"Hey, see the fat kid up there on the bike? Let's throw this at him.\nIt'll be funny!\" (Or something said far cruder, I imagine). \n\nThe cupcakes\nwere thrown at my son's face, but he blocked the throws and it\nsplattered over his favorite t-shirt and shorts, his right arm, socks,\nand shoes. The perpetrators drove off instantly. My son was humiliated\nand upset. He called home on his cell phone (yes, he has one, a move\nthat at first we thought was crazy to do for someone this age, but now\ntake great comfort in the fact that he has one). He told his dad what\nhappened. My husband jumped in our car immediately and drove the few\nblocks away to get our son. After loading up the bike and our son, they\ndrove to get my daughter and I, who happened to be out on a\nneighborhood walk at the time, to tell us what happened.\n\nAnd what happened would upset any child, but my son is not any\nchild. He is on the autistic spectrum\u00a0 (high functioning) with some\nadded conditions. Life is not easy for my child. The fact that he can\neven ride a bike (despite some impaired fine and gross motor skills) is\na big deal. He's worked hard, despite huge challenges to earn his\nindependence on his bike. He has to work harder, plan further, and deal\nwith some issues that no child should ever have to deal with. While he\nis a big kid, medications to treat his conditions, pack on weight,\nsomething he struggles with every single day. The hardest part of it\nall and the most difficult to stomach, is that my son has been the\nsurvivor of bullying in the school system and elsewhere multiple times.\nHe dealt with the following: being called dumb, slow, weird, disturbed,\nand fat. Some of these cruel peers from his mid-elementary school days,\ndid receive punishment for their poor behavior. Most didn't. I even had\nsome of them do this right in front of ME, in a bold and uncaring move.\nEven adults in my community, who were either unwilling or unable to\nhave understanding, said inappropriate comments within an earshot of my\nchild. Each day is work for my son. Each day is work for our family.\nEach day presents challenges. \n\nAnd now this. \n\nBut there is a good news story in all of this. Really. \n\nAfter being\nvery upset when my son returned home, he did something rather\nunexpected. He handled the situation very maturely and wisely. He said,\n\"I am mad about this, but I am sad, too.\" He remained calm, despite it\nall. In the past, my husband and I would have expected a tantrum,\ntears, depression, and/or anger due to his conditions. Not here.\nAlthough he did say, \"I don't think I want to ride my bike anymore.\" It\nwas then, that as parents, our hearts got crushed. My husband was even\nreduced to tears when our son had left the room, he was so shaken. We\nwere so angry, sad, and disappointed. We wished we would have caught\nthe horrid people that did this and had a word with them. We wished\nlife wasn't so unfair. We wished, since that this happened on a busy\nstreet, that some caring adult would have stopped to help, offer a kind\nword, or something. This did not happen. Nothing happened but injustice\nand cruelty. And even though we worked hard to show love, kindness, and\nsupport to our son for the rest of the evening, it was still hard to\nbreathe and think. We wondered if this would be a big setback for him\nand this worried us to no end.\n\nBut it was this 11 year old,\u00a0 developmentally and learning disabled child that turned it around in less than a day. \n\nFirst thing\nthis morning, my son declared, \"I am going to be riding my bike A LOT.\"\nAnd this is what he did! He went out on ride after ride, stopping back\nat home to refuel with food, water, rest,\u00a0 love, and support. And time\nafter time, we sent him back out again as he wished, seeing a boy more\nand more restored. He returned more and more tired, thirsty, and\nsweaty, but triumphant. It was pure joy to see this strength of purpose\nand sense of being.\n\nYou see, he\ntook back HIS community. He took back HIS streets. He took back HIS\nfreedom and fun. He took back the fact that despite disabilities, he\nhad the RIGHT to live his life. And he taught us to do the very same in\nthe face of adversity. \n\nSo, to the\npunks that assaulted my son: you LOST. To the adults in my community:\nif you are a parent, grandparent, relative, neighbor or someone who\ncares about children, what can you do to break the cycle of bullying\nfor any child? How can you stand up to adversity on behalf of children?\nHow can you send a message of love and understanding? These questions\nshould be treated, just like the boy who wouldn't stop riding. Keep\nriding, keep going, and keep going strong. \n\nThanks, Son. \n\n\u00a0Kim authors Gritty City Woman where this post also appears, because, well, it has to.

Really. Sucks.\n\nAnd my rose-tinted glasses are frequently cracked.\n\nSome days, they simply cannot be found. And I don't even bother to look that hard.\n\nWhy did autism suck today, you might ask????\n\nWell, there were the typical, every-day reasons. My non-verbal, six-year-old son screamed in frustration about something that still is a mystery to me. He carried out his current stim with just as much intensity as he did the day before. I literally had to sit on him in order to cut his toenails.\n\nAnd, for some reason, for the first time in, well, a long time, he pooped in his pants.\n\nHis swimsuit, to be exact.\n\nAt a city pool.\n\nThank GOODNESS (I won't say \"God\" because I am not in the mood to bring God into any of this), he was OUT OF THE POOL. And I noticed it as soon as it happened./\n\nBut when the \"bright side\" of things is that you didn't have to tell a life guard to clear the pool on account of your six-year-old's poop ...... well, is there REALLY much of a bright side?\n\nOh, and let me not forget, I was at that city pool with my autistic son, and my four-year-old daughter, and well, NOBODY.\n\nMy son has done great taking himself to the potty at home since we really hit the potty-training business just after his fourth birthday. And I am so glad. But, STILL, STILL, I can't count on him to communicate the need to go when we are out in public.\n\nAnd the kid is a pee fountain.\n\nI take him to pee more frequently than a chain-smoker lights up.\n\nWe had been doing so well with not having accidents, until recently ....\n\nAnd when the accidents start, they seem to come in big numbers.\n\nBut, REALLY, POOP???? And at a pool????\n\nI am Ms. Automatic-pilot when there is such a situation. I am not good at many things, but if there is an autistic child with a poop crisis in public, I am your girl.\n\nSo, when I saw the face, and confirmed the existence of a wet, messy poop, I just went into action.\n\nI took both kids to the bathroom immediately and got my son to the potty where he finished his business. I checked out the swimsuit and realized it was NOT worth saving. Good-bye new swim trunks. I cleaned up his messy bottom and took him straight to the shower, where I scrubbed the both of us down with soap as if we were about to perform surgery. I went back to the bathroom stall and cleaned up the toilet. And, because all of the spare clothes for my son were in the car a good distance away, I let him wear my tee-shirt. (I had my swimsuit on, people, so don't get any ideas).\n\nIt was all a pain.\nA great big pain.\nShouldn't we be well past this?\n\nI certainly let my son know just how unhappy I was with the circumstances.\nHe wasn't very happy either, my poor boy.\n\nIt makes me frustrated.\n\nAnd it makes me sad.\nSad for me, because, yes, I sometimes allow myself a bit of self-pity. I had no idea this would be what I was in for when I first learned I was pregnant.\n\nSad for my son, because, after all, he deserves the most sympathy. He is the one who struggles to understand this world, and without the benefit of ANY language.\n\nAnd sad for my daughter, who sat through this whole ordeal on a bench in the bathroom by herself.\n\nShe is plenty old enough to understand that her brother should not be having these problems.\n\nShe is sophisticated enough to realize that her mother is S-T-R-E-S-S-E-D. And, that, in turn, brings stress to her life. She actually worries about me. My four-year-old daughter worries about me.\n\nOh, lord, just pile it on.\n\nI am so very, very sad for my daughter because there are many moments in her life, just like this one today, where she sits or stands alone, waiting .... just waiting.\n\nWaiting for me to tend to her brother's problem, need or outburst.\n\nWaiting for me to prompt whatever form of communication I can get from him, even if it is just eye-contact, a nod of the head and a \"yeah.\"\n\nWaiting for me to finish working with him -- because I feel so much guilt if I don't spend at least some time trying to help him accomplish something, even if it is as simple as focusing on a puzzle.\n\nIt simply is not fair. There should be someone else on the scene. Someone focusing on her. Or sharing the responsibility of focusing on her brother so that I can sometimes get to focus on her.\n\nOh, how I would love to just focus on her.\n\nBut, even when I get a moment to do so, I am so tired.\n\nSo very, very tired.\n\nI am not what my kids deserve.\n\nEither one of them.\n\nAnd I just don't know if I ever will be.\n\nI have my doubts.\n\nBut, man, can I clean up the poop in a crisis.\n\nIs there a career in that, by the way, because I sure could use a job.\n\nLeah is a single mom of two children, one who has autism and is non-verbal.

{"date": "Wednesday, June 23, 2010", "body": "\nAh, obsessions. If you have an autie kid, you know about them. My son, Moe, has had obsessions since he was a year old. At first it was cars. In particular, one blue car from a parking ramp toy, but in a pinch any car would do. Then it was books and anything with letters. This was pre-diagnosis, so at the time we didn't consider them obsessions. In fact, we were very proud of our little man's ability to sit still for so long and amazed at how young he learned his letters.  Then came the electronic toys. Anything with lights and sounds could become all-consuming: the toy phone, followed by the shape sorter, the electric guitar and the zebra bouncer. Around the time my daughter was born, it was the Incrediblock. He would play with that thing, watching the spinning top go around and around at the push of a button, for 45 minutes. Not a typical behavior for sure, but certainly a coping mechanism for the changes that were going on around him, over which he had no understanding and no control.  After Moe's diagnosis, and the all-consuming shopping cart (also with lights and sounds) obsession, we removed all of these toys from the house. They would make appearances during ABA sessions as reinforcers, but for the most part they live in the garage. Occasionally, I will bring one out if I need Moe to sit still for a little while, say, during a haircut or doctor visit. I don't think these obsessions are harmful in and of themselves. Clearly, Moe gets something from the visual stimulation, so I like to allow him a little time with these toys, but they aren't conducive to social interaction.  Moe's latest obsession is water. He has always loved to play in the water, whether it's bath time (\"bath\" was one of his first words, although we don't hear it much anymore), hanging out in Grandma and Grandpa's pool, or splashing at the water table at school. So as summer approached, and I grew concerned about filling our afternoons, I was excited about playing with sprinkler toys in our backyard and going to some great parks in our area that have really cool water features.  But now Moe has just gotten tall enough to discover the water dispenser in our refrigerator door. Our fridge doesn't have a child lock, so I've been spending a lot of time trying to teach him that pushing the lever is not okay. My efforts so far have not been successful. Moe goes right over and makes himself a nice cold (filtered!) shower. Even as I get in his face and tell him \"No!\" he giggles and grins like he just discovered the greatest thing in the world. Yesterday, I got the bright idea to tape up the front of the door so he couldn't get to the levers. Moe didn't miss a beat, taking the bottom piece of tape right off, reaching his hand up, and letting it rain. We can disconnect the water supply, but I'd much prefer it if he learned to not do it at all, since I don't want him flooding other people's houses. Clearly, this is going to take some work.  \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/06/obsessions.html", "title": "Obsessions"},

Kathryn says she has autism, but she is obviously verbal \u2013 and verbal enough to express herself in a coherent manner. One of my sons is neither. Kathryn, if you do have autism, you should realize that it takes many forms, and the form you seem to have is not one that would push me over the edge as a parent. One of my sons is high functioning, but is nowhere near as well spoken as you. He has had times when he wouldn't even venture out of the house due to anxiety. This I can handle. My other son, on the severe, non verbal end, is currently freaking out because the timer went off in the kitchen and I did not jump right up to turn it off; instead I finished typing the last sentence.\n\nMy mistake, because it is now 15 minutes later that I am getting back to this. Kathryn, did you have a mother & father & a stable home? My crappy ex husband took off 2 months after my boys were diagnosed (and has had no contact at all for the last 9 years) \u2013 I am doing it all on my own. I have no breaks, no weekends & holidays off, I have had to give up my job & career & have learned to live off of IHSS because no one else is willing to do what I do for minimum wage to take care of my boys. How DARE you tell me to stop whining & take responsibility! I went up against our school district & filed due process 6 times between the 2 kids and won each time before I realized I could do a better job homeschooling one of my boys and the money would be better spent on decent therapy than lawyers.\n\nMy non verbal son is currently going through adolescence and masturbating every chance he gets. The school district, the regional Center, the Behavioral Therapists \u2013 no one knows how to help him. He peed on his carpet so much that I had to rip up the entire carpet & redo the floors. He is also an eloper \u2013 I have padlocks on my windows and doors so he doesn't run off & get hit by a car, because he has no recognition of personal safety, despite years of therapy. Am I saying I wish he wasn't like this? You're damn well right I'm saying that! It is not all lovey white light and we just have to accept our children the way they are \u2013 it's the world that won't accept them, or take care of them after I am gone. My son will never function in the world we live in, and I am constantly trying to find the best place for him to fit. \n\nI love my son, but yes, his autism is similar to a death sentence \u2013 without me, there would be no one willing to take care of him, and maybe it wouldn't be actual death, but he would be placed in an institution & drugged into compliance, so don't you EVER dare to tell me to stop whining & accept responsibility. This is my place to vent, and to find support & sympathy, well deserved and definitely needed, and if you really want to know what severe autism is like, you come on over & babysit for a couple hours.

And still doesn't get the FOOD issues... \n\n\"You said he eats steak, we have steak...\"\nYeah, but it is when it is cooked by HIS Dad, in a kitchen, and even then if there is any dark bits or chewy bits... aah, no.\n\nThen we had dinner with a friend two nights ago. She is very understanding. Her brother has schizophrenia, she lived it. So when he refused to eat the spaghetti bol because it had \"too much oregano...\", she was amazing. But I was stressed to the max. \n\nSO, at the last leg of our holiday, when I knew limits were getting way beyond stretched, when we had a two or more hour drive there and then another two or more hour drive to here, where we are spending the night, I refused A MEAL with friends... Well, I had really good reasons. I think.\n\nSadly, because of this they bailed. Even sadder, she is an aide for ASD kids. And my second child's Godmother. We still planned on a couple of hours catch up, just no food involved. Easier, happier, less stressful for all. But somewhere, somehow wires were crossed, or messages mixed, or maybe they just felt we were not doing the right thing by refusing lunch or dinner. \n\nFor us it was not a choice, it was the only way we could go without total meltdown.

I am fed-up with the self-proclaimed experts who have endless streams of advice about my child. One mother of three, jumps on my case about not getting my child out enough. She knows a child with autism who goes out every day.  Out, in this case meaning to crowded places like malls and parades and the local pool. \n\nIt turns out, the child she \"knows\" (who is a teenagaer, NOT a two year old)goes to the donut shop with his mother every day. The child comes in, orders his donut and leaves. Sounds to me it might be some sort of social therapy.This same helpful mother also claims that if my child was surrounded by children every day, he would \"get used to it.\" Right. The children  she speaks of are her three boys. They are cute kids but they fight violently with one anoher constantly. I'm talking rolling on the floor all out brawls! They do not have autism. They are just underdisciplined. They climb on tables (yes the dining room table too), they yell at their mother and they have even slapped her.\n \nThis woman knows my plight. I am a 47 year old adoptive mother of an autistic child. My 57 year old husband has severe COPD and is beginning to exhibit signs of eary alzheimers.  I am in the house 24/7 x 365. I go out to take my child to his doctor or to group. I also go food shopping. Where ever I go, my child comes with me. So, he does get out. Other than that I am at home. I get no 5 minute break other than when both take naps. I have lost all my friends. Who wants to be with someone so boring?  So, any way, my husband recently started having some serious issues with his COPD. This wonderful woman offered to babysit so I could go to the hospital with him. Didn't she show up with her three children and a friend.  Well, needles to say, my husband again had to go alone.\n \nMy body feels like it has been put through a ringer. I am tired and so stressed out. My patience are wearing very thin. I am telling people I love to F off!  Funny thing, people still come to me with their problems. I used to care. Now, I am too burnt out.   I cannot get respite, I can't afford what sitters charge. This is it for me for a long time to come. I just hope that when my husband passes, I will have found some way to be there for him. That is, if the aloneness of this whole situation doesn't kill me first.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/06/free-advice.html", "title": "Free Advice"},

What I neglected (chose not to) mention over there was the incident which triggered the bad night.\n\nI am married to the calmest, most patient man in the universe, Big Boy. All along this autism journey we have been on exactly the same page with our children, agreeing on our methods, making sure Boy 2 does not suffer due to having an older sibling with ASD, believing in the ability of our oldest to grow into a functioning, happy adult. Well, most days anyway. But everybody has a breaking point.\n\nThe night before last Big Boy was helping/supervising both boys with their homework. And for the first time in over a decade, he lost his temper and screamed at our children. Not yelled, screamed. Now I am the loud, scream at them person in this relationship. I am the you get your arse moving NOW ranter. They are used to me and my Madmother ways, and usually respond quickly knowing Mummy has reached THAT point where we cannot push her buttons any further and we'll fall into line as if the last thrity minutes of ignoring/whining/arguing/cheekiness had never happened.\n\n\u00a0I do think they deserved it. There are times they take full advantage of their placid Dad, and can be downright disrespectful. They just chose the wrong time this time. He is tired, stressed from work, unwell. He had had enough. And he blew. \n\nDon't get me wrong, he did not yell abuse, it was more along the lines of \"Enough! You both need to start showing some respect as I'm trying to help you here. This is not MY homework, it is yours and either you stop arguing and start appreciating me being here, or else you can just struggle through by yourselves...\" But screamed at top volume of his grown man voice.\n\n\n\nThe problem is they did not expect it. The issue is\u00a0that it truly scared them. The sad thing is that it pulled the emotional rug out from under their feet. Boy 1 was devastated, and did not stop shaking and sobbing for the next three hours. Boy 2 was saying \"I'm numb. Is it normal to feel nothing? I cannot feel anything...\" I am sure he was in shock. \n\nI held them and tried to calm and reassure them both, but it meant a very late night and two boys who would not sleep without Mum lying close. Which is why I ended up on the floor, cold and stiff at 1am in the morning.\n\n\n\nMy poor, poor boys. All three of them.\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://meanderingmadmother.blogspot.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_scd_kgk5Cys/TD5evAOoe5I/AAAAAAAAB_A/wGnR1Gdrjzg/s1600/angry+man.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_scd_kgk5Cys/TD5e26AoHpI/AAAAAAAAB_I/ZN8ps14A3SM/s1600/BOY+CRYING.jpg", "http://www.mylivesignature.com/"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/07/really-not-good.html", "title": "Really Not Good"},

The world is typically seen through a very narrow point of view -HIS! Who cares about what other people think?\u00a0 It's all about ME! On an intellectual level, I know this.\u00a0 Does it make it any less exasperating or annoying? No.\n\nSo he's asking me over and over again, not only about when I'm going to buy him this $500 dollar video camera.\u00a0 That is the rant of the week.\u00a0 He also ads in a little dose of, \"When can my friend come over? Why don't you like him? Is it because he has special needs.\u00a0 You think he's weird! You think he's annoying don't you?\"\u00a0 Have I ever said anything to that effect? Absolutely not.\u00a0 Do I let him come over every time \"14\" asks? No I do not.\u00a0 Have I taken him and his friend to the mall, out to eat, to 'Best Buy' to hang out, to the movies. Yes! Does he remember or appreciate that? No. \n\nI tell my son that he plays a big part in why his friend can't come over whenever he wants.\u00a0 \"You fight with your brother on a consistent basis.\u00a0 You make no effort to get along with him.\u00a0 You annoy him on\u00a0 purpose.\u00a0 You get him spun up to the point where he's yelling and screaming and you want me to add to that headache by inviting your friend over who does the exact same thing? Why would I do that? Do you think I enjoy having headaches?!\"\n\n\"I fight with \"11\" because he hates my singing and because he calls me fat!\"\u00a0 That is hardly the only reason he fights with his younger brother.\u00a0 But let's take a look at that...where did it all begin? Well let's see you started this whole tit for tat insult flying with, \"You have the ugliest teeth! I hate the way your voice sounds!\"\u00a0 Are these things that your brother can help or change? No.\u00a0 You hurt his feelings, therefore, he finds a way to hurt your feelings.\u00a0 This should be obvious, but for the mind-blind Aspie -it is not.\n\nAnd here's the light bulb...the glimmer of hope, \"I think I fight with him because he has Asperger's too, but he doesn't take any medication and he doesn't have a therapist.\" WOW! Is he right?\u00a0 I don't know.\u00a0 But at least he's thinking beyond himself.\u00a0 I inform him that his younger brother doesn't quite have the same issues as he does.\u00a0 He has no problem with focusing and behavior at school, therefore we haven't seen the need for medication.\u00a0 Does he need a private therapist? Probably so.\u00a0 I think what they need is a sibling therapist to come to the house and see the hell they put me through. I haven't figured out how to make that happen yet.\n\nAs his younger brother gets into the tween stage, he has become much more angry, aggressive and somewhat depressed.\u00a0 It is something we need to address.\u00a0 I explained to \"14\" however, that he is older and should be more mature and could really work on ignoring things if he wants to have the freedom to have a friend over especially, one who also loves to annoy his brother.\u00a0 I explained that for now...I would like to see him continue to nurture his relationship with his friend (who by the way has his own set of special needs).\u00a0 In order to do so, he has to do his part in making peace before we add more fuel to the fire.\n\nI mean why would I do that?\u00a0 I'm a good mom...but I'm not crazy! \n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/07/ah-ha.html", "title": "Ah ha!"},

That will get him out of my house eventually! Let's sign him up for this\u00a0 fabulous, expensive camp! (Actually there were others out there that were a lot more expensive.\u00a0 I didn't totally loose a grip on reality and sign him up for one of those that lasted for three weeks and required sleeping away.)\u00a0 \n\nAfter nearly two weeks of fighting with him to get off of his ass and go...we're both exhausted.\u00a0 Yesterday, I decided to give us both a break.\u00a0 I offered to let him skip swimming to go hang out with a friend.\u00a0 He looked totally surprised, \"You mean we can miss today?\"\u00a0 \"Yes, but only today.\u00a0 That way, I can do something with your brother.\" Then came the shocking moment: \"But I actually LIKE going to swimming. I like going to movie camp too.\u00a0 It's just I'm so tired.\" \n\nHe has given me holy hell every single day, every single time I say it's time to go! Is he trying to drive me crazy? Is this some \"vast right-wing conspiracy?\" No, it actually is not.\u00a0 The light bulb went on...this is just too much for him.\u00a0 It's too much for me.\u00a0 He is not a morning person.\u00a0 The camp is at 9:00 a.m. and it's all the way downtown so we have to get up pretty early.\u00a0 Not to mention, this week they bumped it up to 8:30 a.m. We come home and he has 5 hours of downtime before we have to head off to swimming.\u00a0 He takes a nap and then transitions to working on a project on his computer and then, it's time to go again. \n\nFor an ordinary boy, this shouldn't be a problem.\u00a0 For this boy, it's a disaster.\u00a0 When things go wrong with your kids, doesn't the blame somehow come back around to our parenting decisions?\u00a0 I over did it.\u00a0 One activity at a time for this kid and if at all possible,\u00a0 schedule nothing early in the morning during the summer.\u00a0 At least not, if I have to be the one to take him. \n\nThe best part of his summer so far has been the sleep away Christian camp.\u00a0 He was loved and accepted, made friends and came home with a better attitude.\u00a0 Next year...I'll try to find a Christian camp that last all summer long!\u00a0 Its sad to admit, but he really does much better when he doesn't have me around.\u00a0 What do I know anyway?

He is walking through life with the physical capabilities of a seven-year-old, but the linguistic capabilities of an infant. \n\nHe can twist open the lid to a child-resistant-jar in a second.\n\nHe can turn on all the faucets in a bathroom, stop up the sinks, and leave the scene. \n\nHe can rise in the morning without anyone hearing, open a box of Popsicles, and eat them all, while leaving a few scattered about so that I am left scrubbing neon purple spots with carpet cleaner in the hope that the stains might disappear.\n\nAnd, speaking of disappearing ...\n\nI live in fear of it.\n\nHe cannot disappear.\n\nMy heart couldn't take it.\n\nAnd I don't want to deal with police involvement and the resulting investigation by child protective services. \n\nAnd so.... \n\nMy daughter does not receive the type of responses she deserves.\n\nShe is not on the receiving end of a well-thought-out-parenting-plan. \n\nShe is, instead, on the receiving end of the do-the-best-I-can-even-though-I-am-stressed-beyond-words-and-feel-so-guilty-about-it-mess-otherwise-known-as-my-current-parenting-plan. \n\nShe constantly hears the phrase \"in a minute\" and she constantly waits.\n\nShe doesn't get to go to gymnastics class -- even though I know she would love it -- because she already takes tap and ballet, and I only have the energy to take her brother to the local rec center ONE night a week. \n\nOh, my, doesn't that sound awful???\n\nYes, I admit it. To take my daughter to dance class doesn't merely involve getting her dressed and ready and delivered on time. It also means taking her brother along.

Of course I use the logic -Rome wasn't built in a day.\u00a0 \"It takes time to make friends.\u00a0 Give it some time. Make sure you're smiling.\u00a0 Try not to look angry and sad.\" In other words...fake it. \n\u00a0 \nAfter spending his entire school life (preschool-5th) my youngest started middle school. The words 'transition' and change are not favorites in the language of Asperger's.\u00a0 So saying he was a little nervous is putting it mildly. Middle school is a big change for your average child.\u00a0 Multiply it times 10 for an Aspergers kid.\n\n\"How was your day son?\"\n\"It was horrible! I hate that school! Some kid said to me, 6th graders suck! And I hate that when we go to P.E. I'll have to change clothes and see people NAKED!\"\n\"They won't actually be naked.\u00a0 They will have on underwear, and they will be so busy changing, you guys won't have time to really look at each other!\"\n\"I'm not doing it!\"\n\nI will of course work with the P.E. teachers and special education teacher to make some arrangement to help relieve his anxiety. \u00a0 I sent e-mail to my older son's teacher asking her to get a peer to shadow him during lunch for a while, in hopes that he won't come home so angry and frustrated.\n\nSo is it so great having them back to school? Is it really such a relief, or just a whole new set of problems?\n\nSeeing people naked -it's kind of funny coming from a kid who used to get naked as soon as he walked through the front door!\u00a0 Once upon a time, we couldn't get him to keep clothes on....now we can't get him to take them off and definitely not in public!\u00a0 \n\n\n\nPicture taken before school.\u00a0 I had to get the dog to trick them into smiling! \n\nCheck ouT mY personal bloG :\u00a0 http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/THPf4a9qOlI/AAAAAAAAACI/iJuSsCfS3qA/s1600/boys1stday.JPG"], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/08/seeing-people-naked.html", "title": "Seeing People Naked..."},
{"date": "Thursday, July 15, 2010", "body": "\nI put a great deal of effort in to raising these two Aspergers boys, only to feel unceremoniously slapped in the face.\u00a0 My entire day is devoted their care and entertainment.\u00a0 7 a.m. rise and shine, attempt to have \"14\" do the same so that he can get ready for film camp that I spend a good deal of money for.\u00a0 I am met with \"I don't want to go! I'm very tired today.\"\u00a0 \"Yes...you're especially tired today because I want you to get up.\u00a0 If we were all trying to sleep, you'd be up making noise disturbing those of us who want to sleep.\u00a0 Let's go!\"\n\nHe loves to give me hugs at the most inopportune moments, so I ask for a hug, from across the room just to get him out of bed.\u00a0 It takes him 30 minutes to put on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt. I disappear to get myself together, distracted by the \"Old Spice\" guy who is on \"Good Morning America\" this morning.\u00a0 Oh My God! He's so perfect.\u00a0 I am smiling ear to ear just looking at him.\u00a0 The best part of my day so far! When I return to \"14'\" is still laying in bed, dressed,\u00a0 like he doesn't know what to do next. \n\nI finally get him down stairs to eat a bowl of cereal.\u00a0 We're out the door and in the car when he remembers he needs his IPod to listen too on the way.\u00a0 I drive all the way downtown, listening to him sing, which is really music to my ears although he's off key.\u00a0 It's just so good to not hear him talking about what he wants me to buy him next! I go up 3 flights of stairs to talk to the instructor at Film camp to find out what's been going on.\u00a0 Has he been participating? Not really...but she hopes that when they get into shooting and editing he will get into it. He's more technical than creative.\u00a0 I cringe thinking about how much money I'm spending for him to sit around staring off into space, not joining in the group.\u00a0 I pray that it will pay off in the end when he gets to shoot the movie and edit it.\n\n10 a.m. I'm checking out Facebook.\u00a0 I see a post from \"14\" while he's @ film camp! \"I don't want to go to film camp today. I'm tired!\"\u00a0 I am livid! He's freakin' texting while he's at this $200 a week camp! I'm going to kill him!\n\n2 p.m. We arrive back home so that I can take my mother to get her hair done and the boys for haircuts.\u00a0 They refuse to go together.\u00a0 \"11\" refuses to go at all.\u00a0 I can not leave them at home because they've been vehemently fighting (physically and verbally) over the past several days over the fact that \"11\" hates \"14's\" singing.\u00a0 (I mean they seriously come to blows over this.)\u00a0 \"11\" is told he has no choice but to come.\u00a0 I let \"14\" stay home to relax after the long, difficult morning of sitting around film camp like a bump on a log. \n\n\n6 p.m. is time for Swim Team workout.\u00a0 Everyday, I'm met with resistance.\u00a0 \"I don't want to go! Why'd did you sign me up for all these activities?\" 'Uh...so you don't drive me to the nuthouse with the constant fighting with your brother and telling me that you're bored!'.\u00a0 This boy is twice the size that I am and I almost had to practically carry him inside the pool facility! He sees a girl and a boy outside talking and starts on a rant.\u00a0 \"I WANT A GIRLFRIEND! ITS NOT FAIR!\"\u00a0 \"If you get inside and workout, you will look so good, you'll get all the girls!\" \"I shouldn't have to work my ass off just to get a girl!\u00a0 They should want me for who I am.\" Yeah...a guy who walks around looking angry because he doesn't have a girlfriend.\u00a0 Sure son, that's the way to get a girl. But hey, what do I know about the way superficial teenage girls think?\u00a0 \n\n\nI text his 22 year old brother to ask him can he please take his brother to swim practice tomorrow?\u00a0 He needs encouragement from someone other than me.\u00a0 I'm met with, \"Me and my girlfriend have plans.\" \"Well, can you at least call him and give him a pep talk?\" No response...no call.\u00a0 I reply, \"Great! I guess I have to hire a big brother since you can't do the job!\"\u00a0 \n\n8 p.m. I return home after this painstaking practice session.\u00a0 I take \"11\" swimming at our neighborhood pool since he's pretty much been home all day with Nana.\u00a0 After all, he needs to get his exercise in too!\u00a0 Ask me when was the last time I got to go to Zumba or yoga.\u00a0 I think it was before school let out.\n\n10 p.m. I pour 1 part Pear Vodka 2 parts blueberry juice to keep myself from drowning.\n\nNote: No one was physically harmed by the end of this day.\u00a0 Although I sure felt like slapping somebody!\u00a0 \n\ncHECK oUT mY bLOG\nhttp://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/ \n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsucksrocks.blogspot.com/2010/07/im-drowning.html", "title": "I'm Drowning"},

He is reaching THAT age where the hormones are taking over and thoughts are confused. His psych recommended we provide him some factual sex education material, before things went right off the rails. \n\n\n\nWe had (under his guidance) purchased two books for this very purpose: Secret Boys' Business (Fay Angelo, Heather Pritchard and Rose Stewart) and Making Sense of Sex (Sarah Attwood).

He read the first, under protest, and then only because I pulled the old Dr U said you have to card.\u00a0We then\u00a0asked him if he had any questions?
