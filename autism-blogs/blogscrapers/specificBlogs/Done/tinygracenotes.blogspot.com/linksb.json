The editors have so far more than lived up to the magazine's promising subtitle of \"autism through many lenses\" by creating a beautifully produced document inclusive of a kaleidoscopic range of perspectives. This is a magnificent accomplishment. \n \nI have never met the excellent editors Sharon Fuentes, Sharon Cummings, and Jodi Murphy, nor have I met many of the voices in the inaugural issue of Zoom, but I want to: to me, all of this says that Zoom is poised to be a forum wherein community can truly come together for fellowship and education. \n \nAnd here it is: the link to  Zoom Autism Magazine !  \n \nLove,  Ib\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://joom.ag/9tTb"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2014/10/dear-readers-today-i-am-delighted-to-be.html", "title": "\nZOOM Autism Magazine!\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, December 13, 2014", "body": "\n \u00a0[Note from Ib Grace: Remember I have been trying to get something written about ABA for you? These issues are complex and delicate, and it was taking me forever, and many words. Meanwhile, Sparrow Rose Jones of  Unstrange Mind  wrote this piece on the topic. Sparrow managed to negotiate everything I wanted to say, in fewer, better words. Since I have been recommending it to everyone, I'm happy to report I've obtained permission to reprint this gem in its entirety for ease of access to TGN readers. Now, back to Sparrow's words:] \n \nThis week, I watched a community implode. I\u2019m not going to talk about\n that, though, because it was very painful to watch people I love being \ntreated so badly. But a lot of the implosion centered around a topic I \ndo want to talk about. That topic is ABA \u2013 Applied Behavior Analysis, a \ncommon type of therapy for Autistic children. I watched people fight \naround in circles, chasing their metaphorical tails. It will take some \ntime and lots of words to unpack this topic, but I hope you will stick \nwith me on this because it\u2019s so important and there is a lot that needs \nto be understood here. \n \nHere\u2019s the argument in a nutshell. It gets longer, angrier, and much \nmore detailed than this, but I am exhausted just from reading the \nfighting, so I\u2019m boiling it all down to two statements. And both \nstatements are correct. \n \nAutistic adult: \u201cABA is abuse.\u201d \n \nParent of Autistic child: \u201cI\u2019m not abusive and my child is benefitting greatly from ABA therapy.\u201d \n \nYou read me right: both statements are correct. That is part of what I\n need to unpack today. I think the best place to start is with the fact \nthat both people above are using the term \u201cABA\u201d, but what they are \nactually talking about are usually two different things. First we need \nto define ABA. \n \nWell, actually, first I want to put people at ease. Parents\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s \ngot to be painful to feel like a whole group of people are ganging up on\n you and telling you that you are abusing your child. You love your \nchild. You want the best for your child. You are spending thousands of \ndollars out of pocket to try to give your child the best possible chance\n in life. You worry about your child. You feel like you never even knew \nwhat love was until your child came along. You are not abusing your \nchild. And if something you are doing is harming your child, you want to\n know about it and stop it. It hurts to be told that you are abusive \ntoward the child you love so much. \n \nAnd my fellow Autistics\u00a0\u2014 you grew up feeling picked apart. You were \nsubjected to things that harmed you. You still have PTSD today from \nthings that\u00a0may have been\u00a0done with your best interests at heart but \nwere actually quite damaging. You don\u2019t fit in to the world around you \nand the adults who were charged with your care when you were growing up \nwere stumbling around in the dark when it came to trying to figure out \nhow to raise a child like you were. It is triggering to see that\u00a0so many\n of the things that hurt you when you were growing up are still being \nsaid and done to and about children who are so very much like you were \nwhen you were their age. You want to stop the cycle of pain and you want\n children to grow up happy, healthy, and loved. It frightens and angers \nyou to see many of the \u201cbest practices\u201d that\u00a0Autistic children today \nlive with. \n \nAnd there is a good chance that the two of you \u2014 the Autistic adult \nand the parent of an Autistic child \u2014 are not even\u00a0talking about the \nsame thing when you say \u201cABA.\u201d Major organizations (particularly Autism \nSpeaks) have lobbied hard for Medicaid and insurance companies to cover \nABA therapy for Autistic children. As a result, many therapists now call\n what they do \u201cABA,\u201d even in cases where the actual therapy is very \ndifferent from\u00a0genuine ABA, in order to have their services covered by \ninsurance. It\u2019s similar to the philosophy of therapists I\u2019ve known who \ndon\u2019t believe in diagnosing mental illness\u00a0but put a name on their \npatients\u2019 struggles anyway\u00a0because many insurance policies only pay for \ntherapy if the treatment is for a diagnosis listed in the DSM. That\u2019s \nthe main point that I wanted to make, but there\u2019s still a lot to say on \nthis topic. \n \nIf almost everything is being called \u201cABA\u201d then what is actual ABA? \nAnd why do Autistic adults say it is abusive? What sort of warning signs\n should parents be watching for? What is harmful about certain \npractices? Those are a lot of questions to answer, but I will do my \nbest. Bear in mind that I\u2019m not a therapist \u2014 ABA or otherwise \u2014 and I\u2019m\n not a parent. I\u2019m one Autistic adult, one person coping with \ntherapy-induced PTSD, one person exhausted by the all-out war I see \nevery day between people like me and people who love people like me, one\n person who wants to see a better world for everyone (but, I admit, \nespecially for Autistic people.) \n \nABA was developed by Dr. Ivar Lovaas. As\u00a0 a 1965\u00a0Life Magazine article \n explains, the core theory of ABA was that a therapist, \u201cforcing a \nchange in a child\u2019s outward behavior\u201d would, \u201ceffect an inward \npsychological change.\u201d The article says, \u201cLovaas feels that by I) \nholding any mentally crippled child accountable for his behavior and 2) \nforcing him to act normal, he can push the child toward normality.\u201d \n \nMuch has changed, but this core premise of Lovaas\u2019 work remains \nsolid. ABA\u2019s core\u00a0belief is that forty hours per week of therapy geared \ntoward making a child externally appear as \u201cnormal\u201d as possible will \n\u201cfix the brokenness\u201d inside that made the child behave that way. ABA \nbelieves in an extreme form of \u201cfake it until you make it,\u201d and because \nit is behaviorism at its most pure \u2014 that is, a psychological science \nthat treats internal processes as irrelevant to function (Lovaas said, \n\u201cyou have to put out the fire first before you worry how it started\u201d) \u2014 \nit treats behavior as meaningless and unwanted actions rather than as \ncommunication. \n \nThis approach is troubling for many reasons. \n \nABA strongly emphasizes the importance of intensive, saturated \ntherapy and insists that it is crucial to get 40 hours a week of therapy\n for very young children. Think for a moment how exhausted you, a grown \nadult,\u00a0are after 40 hours of work in a week and you will begin to \nunderstand why we get so concerned about putting a three-year-old child \nthrough such a grueling schedule. Being Autistic doesn\u2019t give a \nthree-year-old child superpowers of endurance. Forty hours a week of ABA\n is not just expensive, it is painfully exhausting. ABA maintains a \nschedule like this with the intention of breaking down a child\u2019s \nresistance and will. \n \nI understand that you are afraid for your child. Their future is \nunknown. You are worried about their ability to live a fulfilled life. \nYou are worried about their ability to have self-supporting work and be \ntaken care of after you pass on. And I understand that this fear, \ncoupled with a deep desire to give your child the best you can give \nthem, can lead you to accept the ABA attitude of \u201cmore is better.\u201d But \nstop a moment and think about the capacity for sustained focus of the \naverage three-year-old and consider what a therapy that tries to double \n(or more) that capacity\u00a0is doing to a child. If you stress a child out \nor even traumatize them with\u00a0extreme therapies, you are paradoxically \nincreasing the chances of incapacitating PTSD in the child\u2019s future. \nYes, you want your child to develop as much as they are able to develop \nand you want them to enjoy their life and hopefully provide for \nthemselves, but exhaustion and trauma\u00a0are not going to aid those sorts \nof development. \n \nWorse than the exhaustion of so many hours of therapy, though, is the\n heavy focus on making a child \u201cindistinguishable from his peers.\u201d The \nmain goal of ABA is to make a child  LOOK  normal. This is \ninsidious for a few reasons. first, it is the best way to get the \nparents to continue to co-operate with the therapists for many years. Of\n course you are going to be moved to tears if the therapist gets your \nchild to look you in the eye or say \u201cMommy\u201d to you or sit at the table \nand eat a meal without fidgeting or melting down. Of course you will \nfeel like the therapist is making progress and healing your child. That \nis a very natural response. So you will see the progress and you will \nwant to continue with ABA therapy and you will be very defensive when \nadults Autistics online suggest that what is happening in your home \nmight be a bad thing. What was bad were fights every mealtime. What was \nbad was never hearing your child\u2019s voice. What was bad were the \njudgmental or pitying stares you and your child got when you went out in\n public and people saw your child spinning around or flapping her hands \nor becoming so anxious you were forced to leave your groceries \nunpurchased and flee the store. \n \nBut if your child is getting classic ABA therapy, what you are seeing\n is an illusion. And what looks like progress is happening at the \nexpense of the child\u2019s sense of self, comfort, feelings of safety, \nability to love who they are, stress levels, and more. The outward \nappearance is of improvement, but with classic ABA therapy, that outward\n improvement is married to a dramatic increase in internal anxiety and \nsuffering. \n \nABA therapists are trained to find out what your child loves the most\n and hold it ransom. Often, it\u2019s food. If your therapist suggests \nwithholding food as a form of behavioral therapy, run screaming. That is\n harmful. If your child\u2019s therapist will not allow you to remain in the \nroom during a session (they will usually tell you that your presence \nwill be a distraction that will keep your child focused on you instead \nof on the therapy they need to be paying attention to) that is a big \nwarning sign. If you are able to witness your child\u2019s therapy sessions \nand your child is spending a lot of time crying or going limp or \nflopping on the floor or showing signs you recognize as indicators of \nanxiety or fear, beware the therapy. If the therapist insists on pushing\n forward with the therapy when your child is crying or going limp \ninstead of giving your child recovery time, run screaming. Therapy that \ntrades your child\u2019s sense of safety in the present for a promise of \nfuture progress is exactly the sort of thing that Autistic adults mean \nwhen they talk about abusive therapy. \n \nTherapy should make your child better, not traumatize them, possibly \nfor many years, potentially for the rest of their life. A therapist \nmight tell you that \u201ca little crying\u201d is a normal thing, but I was once \nan Autistic child and I can tell you that being pushed repeatedly to the\n point of tears with zero sense of personal power and knowing that the \nonly way to get the repeated torment to end was to comply with \neverything that was asked of me, no matter how painful, no matter how \nuneasy it made me feel, no matter how unreasonable the request seemed, \nknowing that I had no way out of a repeat of the torment again and again\n for what felt like it would be the rest of my life was traumatizing to \nsuch a degree that I still carry emotional scars decades later. It \ndoesn\u2019t matter whether the perpetrator is a therapist, a teacher, a \nparent, or an age-peer: bullying is bullying. \n \nIn my opinion, the goal of therapy should be to help the child live a\n better, happier, more functional life. Taking away things like hand \nflapping or spinning is not done to help the child. It is done because \nthe people around the child are uncomfortable with or embarrassed by \nthose behaviors. But those are coping behaviors for the child. It is \nvery important to question why a child engages in the behaviors they do.\n It is very wrong to seek to train away those behaviors without \nunderstanding that they are the child\u2019s means of self-regulation. When \nconsidering whether you have made a wise choice in what therapy you are \nproviding your child or not, you want to always remember a few cardinal \nrules: behavior is communication and/or a means of self-regulation. \nCommunication is more important than speech. Human connection is more \nimportant than forced eye contact. Trust is easy to shatter and \npainfully difficult to re-build. It is more important for a child to be \ncomfortable and functional than to \u201clook normal.\u201d \n \nWork on things like anxiety and sensory issues first. Work on getting\n better sleep (both you and your child). Things like eye contact can \ncome later, much later, and only if your child is comfortable with them.\n There are work-arounds. Lots of people fake eye contact. Lots of people\n have good lives with minimal or no eye contact. But forcing a child to \ndo something that is deeply painful and distressing for no reason other \nthan to make them look more normal is not just unnecessary, it is cruel. \n \nI live two blocks from a behavioral clinic and I frequently walk \nseveral blocks out of my way to avoid walking past it because of the \nkinds of things I have seen when walking past the clinic. Let me tell \nyou about the last thing I saw there, the thing that made me decide that\n I would rather walk an extra half-mile than risk seeing more ABA \ntherapy on the sidewalk in front of the clinic. \n \nA mother and father came out of the clinic with a little girl, \naround\u00a07 years old by my best guess. Mother said, \u201cJanie (not the actual\n name), look at me.\u201d Janie didn\u2019t look at her mother. The mother said to\n the father, \u201cyou know what to do,\u201d and the father took hold of Janie \nand turned her head toward mother, saying, \u201clook at your mother, Janie.\u201d\n Janie resisted, turning her head away and trying to pull out of her \nfather\u2019s hands. \n \nMother crouched down and\u00a0Father\u00a0lifted Janie\u2019s\u00a0whole body up,\u00a0laying \nher across Mother\u2019s knee, face up. \u201cLook at your mother, Janie,\u201d father \nsaid. \u201cLook at me, Janie,\u201d Mother said. Janie began to whimper. Her body\n was as stiff as a board. Father held her body firm and Mother took hold\n of Janie\u2019s head, \u201clook at me, Janie,\u201d\u00a0Mother said. \n \nI was glued to the sidewalk. I didn\u2019t want to see any more but \nI\u00a0couldn\u2019t look away, couldn\u2019t walk away. Janie began\u00a0to moan and thrash\n her body. Father\u2019s hands held her body steady as she kicked and \nflailed. Mother\u2019s hands held Janie\u2019s head steady. Both kept urging Janie\n to look at her mother.\u00a0Janie\u2019s moans turned to screams but neither \nparent let her go. \n \nFinally, Janie\u2019s entire body went limp with defeat. She apparently \nmade eye contact because Mother and Father began to lavish praise on \nher. \u201cGood girl,\u00a0Janie. Good eye contact.\u00a0Good girl. Let\u2019s get some ice \ncream now.\u201d Janie\u2019s limp body slid to the sidewalk where she lay, \nsobbing. Father picked her up and carried her to the car, the whole way \npraising her submission. \u201cGood eye contact, Janie.\u201d \n \n \n (This image \u2013 a drawing of eyes looking away with the caption \n\u201cForced eye contact hinders human contact\u201d \u2013 is a  sticker  and is also \navailable as a  light t-shirt  or  dark t-shirt  in adult and children\u2019s sizes.)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat did Janie learn that day? I\u2019ll give you a hint: it was not that \npeople are more trusting of those who make good eye contact. It was not \nthat she will appear more normal and thus fit into society better if she\n makes good eye contact. It wasn\u2019t even that Mom really loves it when \nJanie connects with her through the eyes like that. \n \nJanie learned that adults can have whatever they want from her, even \nif it hurts and even if they have to hurt her to get it. Janie learned \nthat her body does not belong to her and that she has to give others \naccess to it at any time, for any reason, even if she wasn\u2019t doing \nanything that could hurt herself or others. Janie learned that there is \nno point in resisting and that it is her job to let others do what they \nwant with her body, no matter how uncomfortable it makes her. \n \nYou may think I\u2019m exaggerating or making this out to be more extreme \nthan it is, but stop for a moment and imagine years of this therapy. \nForty hours a week of being told to touch her nose and make eye contact \nand have quiet hands and sit still. A hundred and sixty hours a month of\n being restrained and punished when she doesn\u2019t want to touch her nose \nand being given candy and praise when she does touch her nose for the \n90,000th time. Nearly two thousand hours a year of being explicitly \ntaught that she does not own her body and she does not have the right to\n move it in ways that feel comfortable and safe to her. How many years \nwill she be in therapy? How many years will she be taught to be a good \ngirl? To touch her nose on command? To make eye contact on demand? \nGraduating to hugs, she will be taught that she is required to hug any \nadult who wants a hug from her. She will be punished when she does not \nhug and praised and fed when she does. \n \nAnd who will protect her from the predator who wants to hug her? Who \nwill teach her that she is only required to yield her bodily autonomy \nfor her parents and therapists but not for strangers? What if the \npredator turns out to be one of her therapists or parents? How will she \nresist abuse when she has had so many hours of training in submission? \nTherapy is an investment in the future, but ABA therapy is creating a \nfuture for Janie of being the world\u2019s doormat. Is that the future \nJanie\u2019s parents want for her? \n \nIf your child\u2019s therapist believes it is more important for your \nchild to comply with\u00a0every command\u00a0than to have any control at all over \nhis or her body, run screaming. And don\u2019t forget that a layer of \ntraining does not change the underlying neurology. ABA uses the same \nmethods and theories as dog training and if I train my dog to shake \nhands, it doesn\u2019t make him more human. It just makes him a dog who can \nshake hands. Similarly, if you train an Autistic to make eye contact and\n not flap their hands and say \u201cI love you, too\u201d and stay on task, it \njust makes them into an Autistic who can fake being not-autistic with \nsome relative measure of success. Underneath the performance is still an\n Autistic brain and an Autistic nervous system and it is very important \nto remember that. Being trained to hide any reaction to painful noises, \nsmells, lights, and feelings doesn\u2019t make the pain go away. Imagine \nyears of living with pain that you have been trained to hide. How long \nwould it last before you broke down? Some Autistics last an amazingly \nlong time before they break down and burn out. \n \nAnd intensive ABA therapy will also teach a child that there is \nsomething fundamentally wrong and unacceptable about who they are. Not \nonly is that child trained to look normal, they are trained to hate who \nthey are inside. They are trained to hate who they are and hide who they\n are. They will work very hard to hide who they are, because they have \nlearned to hate who they are. And as a result, they will push themselves\n to the brink of destruction. And when they finally crumble from years \nof hiding their sensory pain and years of performing their social \nscripts and blaming themselves every time a script doesn\u2019t carry them \nsuccessfully through a social situation, they will be angry at \nthemselves and blame themselves for their nervous breakdown and autistic\n burn-out. \n \nAll those years of ABA therapy will have taught them that they are \nfundamentally wrong and broken; that they are required to do everything \nauthority demands of them (whether it\u2019s right or wrong for them); that \nthey are always the one at fault when anything social goes wrong; that \nthey get love, praise, and their basic survival needs met so long as \nthey can hide any trace of autism from others; that what they want \ndoesn\u2019t matter. \n \nNow you know what to watch for. Your child\u2019s therapist may use the \nterm \u201cABA\u201d in order to get paid, but they might not be doing these \nharmful, degrading, abusive things to your child at all. If your child\u2019s\n therapist is respecting your child, not trying to break down the \nchild\u2019s sense of self and body-ownership, treating behavior as \ncommunication rather than pointless motions that need to be trained \naway, valuing speech but not at the expense of communication, giving \nyour child breaks to recover and not over-taxing their limited focusing \nabilities . . . then they can call their therapy anything they want to, \nbut it is not ABA. (And hold on to that therapist! They are golden!) \nAnd I hope that the next time you hear an Autistic adult say that ABA\n is abuse, you are compassionate. Remember the suffering so many of us \nendured. Know that we say those things because we love your children and\n want to help them. We do not say them because we hate you and want to \ncall you abusers. We don\u2019t hate you at all and we want to help you. \nSometimes we are clumsy in how we go about it, because, well, we are \nAutistic and communication difficulties are part of that package. But \nknow that when we attack ABA, we are not intending to attack you. We \nwant your child to sleep through the night and laugh with joy and become\n toilet trained (on whatever schedule their bodies can handle \u2014 don\u2019t \nforget that we tend to be late bloomers), and have a healthy, happy, \nproductive, love-filled life. \n \nWe want you to rejoice in parenting and connect with your children on\n a deep and meaningful level. When an Autistic adult says \u201cABA is \nabuse,\u201d you might be tempted to hear, \u201cyou are abusing your child.\u201d But \nthat is not what we are saying. Next time you hear an Autistic adult say\n \u201cABA is abuse,\u201d please hear those words as, \u201cI love you and your child.\n Be careful! There are unscrupulous people out there who will try to \nconvert the fear you feel for your child\u2019s future into money in their \npocket at the cost of your child\u2019s well-being.\u201d \n \nAnd if you are a therapist and you are upset when we say \u201cABA is \nabuse\u201d, know that we are not talking about you . . . unless you are \nusing shock punishments or making children endure long hours of arduous \ntherapy beyond their ability to cope or teaching children that they do \nnot have the right to say who can have access to intimacy with their \nbody or not (and forced eye contact is a particularly nasty violation of\n a person\u2019s control over their bodily intimacy.) If you are not the kind\n of therapist who we are talking about when we talk about the harm of \ntherapy, then we are not talking about you! Thank you for being one of \nthe good guys. We\u00a0need more like you. Teach others what you know. Spread\n the love and help change the world, please! \n \nThank you for reading all of this. I know it was a lot of words, but \nthis is such an important topic. The children are the future and I don\u2019t\n have words to explain how painful it is when I see Autistic adults \nbeing verbally bullied and abused because they are trying to help the \nchildren by helping parents to understand more about the lived \nexperience of autism and more about the kinds of things that can be very\n harmful to Autistic lives. I had over a decade of therapy in my \nchildhood and much of it was not good therapy and I am explicitly \ndamaged because of it.

And second of all--this part is not so surprising because I am getting used to paying more attention to real life than to media representation--full of lovely people. To hear the ad campaigns and the news and the researchers that get funded by the right kind of corporations tell it, everyone thinks I'm a tragic burden from fearsville, pityland. \n \nIn real life, I go around in the world keeping meeting a diffuse divergent kaleidoscopic spectrum of the wide world of wonderful. \n \nRock on, real life.\u00a0 Especially Michiganders. \n \nOne of the many Rockin' People is the emerging technologies librarian Patricia F. Anderson of University of Michigan, and I'm mentioning her in particular (hi there :) ) because she made this wonderful thing, a Storify, where you can read the things I was saying at the talk that she and others picked up and Live Tweeted by writing them quickly on Twitter right when I said them. Multi-tasking Heroics! AND THEN! She put links to the real things we were talking about, like Tone It Down Taupe, so you can easily look it up. \n \nAlso when you are on there on her Storify page you can see other talks she went to and did this. It is fun. \n \nHere's that link now, in case you want to see more details about what we talked about:  The Awesome Storify Narration of the Michigan Talk . \n \nSo the lovely people and I talked about all sorts of things, like neuroqueering, and being a mother, and our own families, and school, and subversive ways Autistics deal with stigma, and how all the ways of being neurodivergent are not that different from one another...and so much more. \n \nTake that, Stigma Awareness.

This is a Facebook Community group in which you can put up a question and specify if you want it to be answered by only Autistic people for an insider experiential view, or the community at large for the kind of interactional experience or systems understanding or group support that knowing people who have the same things in their lives can bring. From what I see of the people who write to me, most people would love this group and I always send people there privately. \n \nHere, to see what PACLA stands for, is a link to the inaugural magazine they put out:  PACLA Magazine, First Issue.  I love this magazine. The editors are parents of Autistic kids and Autistic themselves! It is an honor to be part of it. The word 'magazine' doesn't even come anywhere near doing justice to the awesome, and these two claim it is their first time. The only reason I believe them is because I believe them, not because of the evidence. :) \n \nLike what you see? Here is a link to the Facebook Group for PACLA  RIGHT HERE.  One of the people who started it, Alyssa Hillary, is a fabulous young Autistic activist scholar, a good friend of mine in person. Many parents and autistics are involved, too, in addition to the ones who started it, and the movement is growing.  \n \nNext, look at the archives of this blogging collective in which I sometimes participate, and so do many others. It is called We Are Like Your Child  and can be found online HERE. . The point of this blog is that we talk about difficult issues within, and how we create workarounds for these things, to make things doable notwithstanding. The disabled people who write here are all people who, like me, care about Autistic and other disabled children and their whole families. All of us are reaching out for a better world. This is another place to find people who will make you notice you are never really alone. They are part of my personal lifeline. May they (we) be the same for you and yours. \n \nThanks so much for your patience and I will see you in June! \n \nLove,  \nIb\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.calameo.com/read/003164484af94d91e10b5", "https://www.facebook.com/ParentingAutisticChildrenWithLoveAcceptance", "http://wearelikeyourchild.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2014/05/you-are-not-alone.html", "title": "\nYou Are Not Alone\n"},

In case you are clicking from TGN directly, here is a link to the flashblog site itself, where you can read lots of others, and get yourself very happy:  HERE IS THAT LINK . What I love about this is that it's organized by a loving group of people, some of whose kids are Autistic; and some of the people are Autistic themselves, and some are not, and some of them have no kids. Just a bunch of love bringing us together. \n \n \n \n[Image: Flashblog logo of a pink and white heart made out of lacy smaller hearts with #PosAutive in it. It says, Flashblog: Love Not Fear, presented by Boycott Autism Speaks, and cites a deadline, for which I am late, of course.] \nLately I have been having a lot of trouble writing, so I will tell a story of Love winning out over Fear, in pictures.  \n \nOne day a bit ago, we were having an action where we were supposed to take a picture of ourselves with a sign saying something like \"I am not afraid to say I am Autistic.\" This was because something was making the fearmongers smear our name again, as usual, nothing really different. And I support these actions, but I have this thing of being rather precise. So, I couldn't lie. I do say it freely: I am Autistic; however, I don't say it without trepidation, especially when one of these media scarymovie frenzies is going on. This is the picture I made: \n \n \n \n \n \n[Here is a webcam picture of me sitting on the bed, holding a hand-lettered sign. The sign says: I AM AUTISTIC AND TIRED OF FEAR.] \nThe boys were napping and Layenie came in and sat next to me on the bed, having finished what she had been doing really quick. She saw this thing I made and gave me a big, much-needed hug. Then she looked at her Facebook and saw a call for participation in another action that our people who love us were taking in support, having to do with This Is Autism. Layenie immediately made this: \n \n \u00a0 \n \n[Layenie's pic here is of me with the twin boys, age about one, in the transition from baby to toddler. She has inscribed the picture with these words: \"This is Ibby. Ibby is a professor, a mother extraordinaire, and a wonderful spouse. She is light, laughter, and love. She is books, trains, twirly things, and cracking up about the word underwear. This is autism, and oh boy, am I glad.\"] \nThis made my eyes leak. It also made my eyes leak to look at it again just now, and remember, and do the image description. \n \nIn a cage match between love and fear, love wins. \n \nLove wins.  \n \nFear can come back as much as it wants. For me, in my experience of my self, I know it will. \n \nBut I also know love wins. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[This is a meme that says \"Caring and respect are better than pity and fear.

She is receiving OT, Speech, Music therapy and ABA. I have felt\nit was the ABA where the progress we've seen has been made. However, as someone\nwho is a staunch advocate for my daughter and her Autistic peers, I want to\nalways be doing what is best and least stressful for her. \n \nI have seen quite a bit of controversy in the Autism community by receivers of\nABA, that express having PTSD from the experience and are now staunch opponents\nof ABA. But what they describe going through and what many of our kids do, seem\nvastly different. Is there any way to clarify this issue, about just what ABA\nis and isn't and how, in layman's terms a Parent can avoid and identify it? \n \nThis is a topic that causes a great deal of angst, distrust and Parents feeling\nthey are being labeled as abusers if they are using ABA...which I guess, may\nreally not be? Any help at resolving this would be great! \n\n\n Thank you! \n \nSandy \n \n\n\n \n\n\nDear Sandy, \n \n\n\nThank you so much for asking. \n \n\n\nThis question is so very important, and as you say, the things people say\nand do about it can be very confusing, and from where I stand, I have been able\nto collect more than the usual amount of information about why they have to do\nand say the confusing things that conflict with each other, and was wondering\nif I would be able to help. \n \n\n\nI hope I can help. \n \n\n\nI will try to keep this a little bit shorter than a big giant book by\nlinking to other related things I wrote before, and breaking it down into parts\nso you can look at the pieces of the question you are interested in at any\ngiven time. \n \n\n\nHere are the topics I will touch on: \n \n\n\n Why are so many Autistic people who\nhave been through ABA against it, and/or experiencing PTSD? \n \n\n\n In that case, why would anyone defend\nit? What is going on there? \n \n\n\n What do you mean by the notion that a\ntype of treatment can be morally wrong? \n \n\n\n But I have seen it work well, and you\njust gave what looked to me a whole lot like an example. Can you explain what is going on here, when it works\nwell? \n \n\n\n Why would that still be called ABA\nthen? Why don\u2019t they call it something totally else? \n \n\n\n Can you see a solution to this thorny\nissue? What would it be like? \n \n\n\n Meanwhile, before that solution\nhappens, what are practical actions I, as a parent, can take in real life? I\nwant to do what is right for my kids, and I also want to be a good person in\nthe world. \n \n\n\nI\u2019m writing back now because I have had your letter for a longish time, I\nthink, and I wanted you to know this is what I\u2019m working on, and I think it\u2019s\nreally important, and I want to get it right. Please write back if my outline\nabove doesn\u2019t hit on all cylinders, but so far I have answers in my head for\nall the things above that I just need to translate into readable words, so that\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019m going for. \n \n\n\nLove, \nIb \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2014/01/true-answers-about-aba-part-1.html", "title": "\nTrue Answers About ABA (Part 1)\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 10, 2012", "body": "\n Jane (that is my son, it is pronounced YAH-NEH) started to speak \nMacedonian (his mother tongue) at around two and by 3 1/2 he started to \nuse English words. Gradually, he totally abandoned Macedonian and he \nused only English. All of his therapists and teachers insisted on him \nusing Macedonian and now he speaks English at home and Macedonian in the\n school to sometimes awkward results. I know it is really hard on him to\n use Macedonian, so my question here would be if I should also insist on\n Macedonian, having in mind that it is an official language here and \nthat using English only would render him maladjusted? Unfortunately, \ncurrent state is also unsustainable as it is very confusing for him to \nbe bilingual? \n \n [To get further information I asked a little more (\" Before I go into detail in a blog\n post answering you Maja, would you mind if I ask some clarifying \nquestions?  Are you or your partner (or both) a native English speaker? \n If so, does the English speaker have very fluent Macedonian? ....  Will you tell me more about Jane, what \nhe most enjoys doing, what you think he would read about if he could \nread well, for example, and what he chooses to do when given free choice\n of all things to do?  What is your personal assessment of him in \nexpressive and receptive language? Which is easier for him, do you \nthink, for example?\")  and here was the answer:] \n \u00a0   \n I would say that my English is \nfairly good, but my husband's is not so. Jane is learning his English \nfrom TV and movies, mostly. Most of the people we are socializing with I\n speak English to certain degree, so it is not difficult for him to acquire new words. I  have to admit that at the beginning when he \nstarted to use English I encouraged him, I thought that it is good for \nhim. Later, as his therapists insisted on him speaking Macedonian, I \ntried to reduce English usage, but to no avail. I believe that his \nmotivation comes from the fact that people appreciate the fact that he \nspeaks English and it makes him feel competent.... I almost forgot the most \ninteresting thing: He likes to call himself DJ, short from DJ Music. He \nclaims that he is English, not Macedonian. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \n At first my problem answering this was that I was getting stuck on the notion of whether bilingualism would be confusing if you were Autistic, even though studies have shown that it is actually helpful in increasing executive functioning in children overall, and the beneficial effects persist into adulthood  ( here   is just one good example of such a study, with a useful bibliography pointing toward more).\u00a0 I wondered if our brains were so different that perhaps the studies didn't count for us.\u00a0 This is still an interesting question and one I might pursue at some point soon, if funders are interested. \n \n But then I thought about it some more.\u00a0 What is really going on here isn't really centrally a question of the thing I was hearing to to be, at first.\u00a0 What is probably a more important thing to think about is that DJ here is interested enough in the English language to express himself in it quite freely.\u00a0 You, his mother, have noticed that it makes him feel competent, and people appreciate him for it.\u00a0 He is interested in aspects of English-speaking culture to the extent that he gave himself a nickname. \n \n Patrick Schwarz and Paula Kluth wrote a wonderful book called  Just Give Him the Whale  which I believe gets at the core of what we are really talking about here, and may help you communicate with DJ's teachers and therapists why it can be an excellent idea to meet him in the English language.\u00a0 The basic idea is that he has found a thing in which he is passionately interested, so interested that he wants to include other people, to tell other people what he is thinking, to use his imagination and share with them.\u00a0 This is a wonderful thing, and can be helpful for him in further aspects of his life.\u00a0 For example, in English, he may become interested in other aspects of schoolwork.\u00a0 In English, he may finally become interested in Macedonian.\u00a0 This is different from taking away his special interests and not allowing him to do the things that make him feel confident and passionate: it is the opposite.\u00a0 The idea is that you as his mother can help his service providers understand how important that feeling of confidence and engagement and being interested is for a person who is trying to learn things, and use the fact that he cares about what he cares about to find the keys perhaps to get him interested in other things. \n \n In short, I do not believe his Macedonian is awkward because he can speak some English.\u00a0 I believe it may be becoming awkward because in the efforts being made to stop him from doing what he finds truly interesting, his feeling of competence is sliding away from him.\u00a0 When your feeling of competence slides away, your actual competence is soon to follow.\u00a0 (I believe this is true for every human being in the world, but it is so true for me that I can become absolutely stymied, petrified and broken down from the effects of it.\u00a0 This is how I am also partly guessing the importance of not taking English away from DJ.)\u00a0 Ask them to try it where he is the expert in his class at translating between English and Macedonian, particularly with respect to the plots and dialogues of key movies and song lyrics that are important to him.\u00a0 See if his Macedonian doesn't pick up: I am almost certain that in circumstances of himself being positioned as expert, it will do just that.\u00a0 Please get this book of Schwarz and Kluth I mentioned which explains more of what I am saying, and let me know what happens with this idea. \n \n Another detail here I wanted to add.\u00a0 You might have noticed that I am saying your son Jane is called DJ because he is calling himself that.\u00a0 The reason I am doing this is a habit I have with people having to do with following their own specifications of what I should call them.\u00a0 Sometimes it is not very important, just a type of politeness on my part, or a quirk, but other times it can be very important.\u00a0 When a person who may not believe that speaking is a useful way of getting things to change or happen in the world finds out that he or she can exert small amounts of will into the world by speaking, this will make speaking seem more worthwhile.\u00a0 Some people go through life believing nothing they say matters and nobody will care, so it has long been a secret personal mission of mine to announce through action that I am listening in small ways.\u00a0 Here it will not do anything because I don't think DJ will read these words, but I am just telling you the habit I have of why I am calling him this, because you told me he likes to call himself this name so I am following his preference, and it does not matter to me that he is only a child, because children have even less power in life.  \n \n If you have any further ideas or questions or parts of it I did not address sufficiently, please also write back.\u00a0 I am sorry it took me so long to answer because of the fact that I was trying to answer what I am now convinced was the wrong question! \n \n

And that you're really autistic?! I'm\nflustered and don't know where to start! To distill down the story of my life\nwhich is now one big question and so few answers, I'll share this. Some weeks\nago (exactly 11 weeks tomorrow, but who is counting anyway?) my 2 year old son\nwas diagnosed with autism. The Dr believes him to be \"moderate.\" That\nsame week, his father, and my partner was also dx'd on the spectrum. I'm lonely\nand sad. I really don't know what \"moderately autistic\" means, or how\nto handle some of the behaviors my son exhibits. As an example, is it best to\ntry to discipline tantrums, or is this something that he can't help? I want him\nto be thoroughly and authentically himself. But this want is conflicted with my\noverwhelming desire for him to fit in socially to avoid any unkindness coming\nin his direction. I feel terrible scolding him for acting up - should I? Is\nthere a better way? \n \n \n \nDear\nGoldie,\u00a0 (I am just making that up to call you, because I hope you did\nfind a pot of gold; I hope I can do something good for you here.\u00a0 You\ndeserve to feel better and it would be my honor to be a part of that in any way\nI can...)  \n \n \n \nIt's\ntrue, you can, and I am.\u00a0 :)\u00a0 Thanks for coming. \n \n \n \nHere\nI will talk a little about the difference between meltdowns and tantrums, how\nyou can tell, how to manage each in a quick super-effective way my mother used\nwith me that has a good side effect for your stress level and doesn't involve\nhaving to scold/feel terrible (not that effective in either case, and I'll\nexplain why in both cases).\u00a0 Also I want to talk about how I think I might\nunderstand why you are feeling lonely, and my perspective on why I have\nevidence that some of the reason you feel lonely might be actually data\nsuggesting that you are awesome.\u00a0 Lastly, the fact that your son's father,\nyour partner, is also on the spectrum can be used to your advantage, especially\nif everyone embraces it.\u00a0 I have something to say about that as well\nbecause it took me sooooooooo long to embrace it and if I knew then what I know\nnow... well.\u00a0 I know it now so I'm hoping to save others some time and\ngrief. \n \n \n \nFirst,\nthe immediately practical. \n \n \n \nTantrums\nand meltdowns can look very similar, especially when carried out by a two year\nold.\u00a0 The primary difference is why they are happening and what they\ncommunicate.\u00a0 You can tell the difference if you look at the scenario\ngoing on around the kid, what happened before and during, and also with\npractice by looking straight at the kid, listening to breathing patterns, hands\nover ears, not noticing whether you are noticing, etc.  \n \n \n \nI\nwant to say straight off that I believe all two year old people are capable of\nhaving both tantrums and meltdowns, and will do so depending on the\nscenario.\u00a0 The trouble with being autistic is that you have meltdowns a\nlot more and people think they are tantrums, so people think you are constantly\nhaving tantrums.\u00a0 That is why I really want to speak about the difference,\neven though I am ultimately going to suggest a similar approach (but not for\nthe exact same reasons, funnily enough). \n \n \n \nIn\na tantrum, I am angry, trying to get something, or work it. \u00a0I am thinking something like this: \n \n\"I will NOT leave this SPOT until THOSE\nCHOCODRAGONS ARE IN THAT CART!!!!! \u00a0HOW IS IT THAT NOBODY HEARS ME!!!\u00a0 I AM IBBY!!!!\u00a0 I WILL NOT BE IGNORED!!!!!\"\u00a0 On the outside, I may\nbe sitting there screaming, kicking, etc.\u00a0 Chances are, I will look at my parents or guardians to be sure they are noticing.\u00a0 This is often the primary\ndead giveaway. \n \n \n \nIn\na meltdown, I am panicky, needing to escape, overwhelmed with too much or\nconflicting information or sensory horribleness, and cannot take it\nanymore. \u00a0I am thinking something like this: \n \n\"Aaaaaaaaauuuuuuggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\u00a0 If I could think straighter, so that words were involved, it might translate to\nsomething like, \"My ears can't take the nightmarish din!\u00a0 The lights\nburn holes in my eyes even if I close them, and my head throbs in a rhythm\ndifferent from the muzak, which is torturing me!\u00a0 People swarm they swarm\nwhy are they talking so much talk so loud dissonant why does she yell at him\nthat man might want not to whistle when he has no pitch ack and the peanut\nbutter is in the wrong place! THE WRONG PLACE THAT IS IT I AM DONE\nFOR!\"\u00a0 But these thoughts are rapid and really sound more like my\nfirst rendition. On the outside, I may be sitting there screaming, kicking,\netc.\u00a0 Chances are, if I'm looking at my parent or guardian at all, I look more drowning than angry, but probably cannot look,\nand have my hands over my ears or hitting the floor the cart-handle or even myself, eyes screwed shut in attempted escape. \n \n \n \nSo,\ntantrum is anger, and meltdown is panic. \n \n \n \nHere\nis why scolding doesn't work either time, and there is a better way, but when\nyou hear it, I hope it will change your life.\u00a0 I think when my mother came\nup with it, life with baby-me became ever so much less of a nightmare in public.\u00a0\n:) \n \n \n \nIn\na tantrum situation, you may scold, but because tantrum is anger, that sets up\na power struggle.\u00a0 You cannot really win this power struggle, because your\ntwo year old is  totally not embarrassed  about acting like that in public,\nwhereas you are  mortified \u00a0by the insensitive, judgmental people staring\ndaggers at you.\u00a0 Kid wins. \n \n \n \nIn\na meltdown situation, you may scold, but because the kid is totally overloaded,\nchances are you are probably not getting through  at all  and nothing you say\nis even being heard over the din of the heinous fluorescent audiovisual buzzhum\nmixed with the everlasting human yimmer-yammer and the competitions of the\nmultiple musics and lasers and cash registers out of rhythm off of key and the\nwhooshing thud of the heartbeat of panic trying to block it out when he can't\neven trust where the peanut butter is....\u00a0 Not useful. \n \n \n \nMy\nmother's magic fix works equally in both situations for either reason. \n \n \n \nHere's\nhow it goes. \n \n \n \nFirst,\nvery early on in the process, my mother quietly, calmly would say something\nlike, \"If you settle down, we can stay.\" This would make there be a\nchoice if it happened to be a tantrum where I  could  cut it out still and might\nwant to choose self-regulation and staying.\u00a0 If it was going to be a meltdown,\nof course I did not want to stay, and also I would not be able to settle down,\nso this was a win-win item of communication. \n \n \n \nThen,\nif I wouldn't or couldn't settle down, we would promptly leave the environment,\njust immediately pick up and go, into a quiet place, preferably as green as possible, which is\ncalming.\u00a0 Here is why this is a good idea in either circumstance: \n \n \n \n1. \u00a0  The tantrum: There goes the\nChocodragons, not in the cart, no chance of getting in the cart ever, and the\njudgy busybodies who think they could do so much better than you don't have\ntime to formulate that thought, let alone stare meaningfully at you trying to\nlet you know it.\u00a0 Meanwhile, if this happens consistently, I am soon to\nlearn that the tantrum is the least effective method of getting my way known to\nchildkind. \n \n \n \n2. \u00a0  The meltdown: You are my hero. \u00a0  The world had become a roiling\nnightmare and you fixed it. \u00a0  When\nthis feeling of overwhelm keeps happening to me I will probably keep melting\ndown at some point because I cannot help it, but I will feel calmer in general\nknowing that you are there and you know how to make things better. \u00a0  My general anxiety level will decrease\nas my trust increases because I have been understood. \n \n \n \nIt\nmade me very happy to read where you said you wanted your son to be thoroughly\nand authentically himself. I think it is not possible to prevent unkindness\nfrom coming anyone\u2019s way, because people are going to be how they are going to\nbe, even if this includes some unfortunate meanness and ignorance. \u00a0  But having such a supportive mother in\nyour corner who gives you the confidence to be yourself with a clean heart and\ncourageous mind makes a lot of unkindness bounce off of you in ways it would\nnot bounce off if you were more insecure because you could tell your family\nwished you were different. \u00a0  So your\nson is off to a very, very good start as far as I can see! \u00a0  Let the mean people change; there is no\nreason for people who are minding their own business just being themselves to\nchange in order to suit the mean people. \u00a0\n This is a thing the world needs to learn to do better and I clearly see\nthat you can be one of the right-minded ones with good instincts who help get\nthis new direction flowing. \n \n \n \nThe\nlast thing I wanted to talk about was that you have the possibility of much community if you are interested and do not have to do things alone. \u00a0\n I really don\u2019t want you to have to feel sad and lonely because just from\nyour writing I can tell you are awesome. \u00a0\n Other evidence I have that you are awesome is that people on the\nspectrum are known to be kind of on the picky side, and your partner is now\nknown by me to be on the spectrum, so, logically, a picky person picked you,\ntherefore\u2026 you follow me. \u00a0 More r eason\nto believe you are awesome. \n \n \n \nChapters\nof the Autistic Self Advocacy Network \u00a0\n (ASAN) which your partner could join anywhere work differently, but I\nknow the one in Chicago also welcomes family members such as yourself who value\nneurodiversity, which is to say you are someone who wants people to be able to be authentically\nthemselves instead of having to pretend to be \u201cnormal,\u201d whatever that\nmeans. \u00a0  I don\u2019t know where you\nlive, of course. \u00a0  But feel free to\ncontact me back again to put you in touch with the communities in your\narea. \u00a0  On Facebook, also, if you\nenjoy networking online, there are many satisfying ways to make friends who\nunderstand, and I could introduce you around, if you feel that is something you would like to have happen. \n \n \n \nThe\nfact that your partner is on the spectrum himself could be a wonderful resource\nif he is in a place where he is ready to embrace it. \u00a0  He might not be, though. \u00a0  It took me a while to feel good about it because of the way\nthe world can be. \u00a0  But things are\nchanging now, for the better. \u00a0  If\nhe is OK with \u00a0  his own diagnosis,\nthough, the sky is the limit on ways he can be a role model. \u00a0  There are excellent groups also on the\ninternet for AS parenting I can hook you up with. \n \n \n \nThe\nlast thing I want to say is that if other things come up and you just want to\nwrite back here instead of getting into communities and everything, please feel free and welcome! \u00a0  You\ndon\u2019t have to \u201ccome out\u201d on Facebook or anything, and I\u2019m not trying to make\nyou do that. \u00a0  Just be Anonymous if\nyou like, but tell me you are Goldie :) . \n \n \n \nAll\nthe best,  \n \nIb \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2012/10/meltdowns-vs-tantrums-new-mother-feels.html", "title": "\nMeltdowns vs Tantrums (A New Mother Feels Alone)\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 4, 2012", "body": "\n Which brings me to a topic that has baffled me plagued me given me sleepless nights and sometimes nightmares that's right I AM TALKING ABOUT SOCIALIZATION AND SOCIAL SKILLS! I would love love *love* your view of what I've been told repeatedly in the past: social skills are critical for our children, social skills improve their speech, being with peers is how our kids imitate typical kids (earning their \"pass\" privilege I suppose). I'll be honest, I come from an era (and also not of this culture, originally) where we didn't do play-dates. We didn't have preschool. My mom wasn't even sure she wanted me in kindergarten if I could start 1st grade, and primarily for academic reasons -- NOT for social skills. My argument is, \"why should I care if socialization comes from adults versus peers (kids my kid's age)? After all, adults have better social skills than kids -- it makes sense to me to have my child interact more with adults if this is where he's comfortable and he will learn social skills from people who have learned social skills. What's wrong with waiting until my kid's peers are beyond the age where they solve problems with physical action and change their moods 25 times in 15 minutes a.k.a unpredictable preschoolers?\" I don't get it. Please help me -- my brain is just not clicking on the benefits of socialization for very young children when it can be so stressful for those children. \n \n This is a complex, difficult topic, and also pivotal and super important. \u00a0My overall views on it will come from two or three places or ways of thinking as I explore it here, but I will also include within my views a belief that in particular circumstances my specific opinions do change from the overall. \u00a0Some people might think this is wishy washy or unhelpful, but I think it is more helpful to be very precise about these things instead of having some sort of rule made up that is supposed to work for everyone, because that is not usually the way things work best in real life. \n \n If, when you are reading this post, you believe your child is more like the counterexamples I am writing less about or mentioning as exceptions to my usual idea, and would like to hear more about that, please say so in the comments, because I will have amazing resources for you. \n \n In my personal experience, which is going to be my first way of thinking to derive ideas from, I am very glad I learned from peers, even though a lot of the time I considered them to be noisy and baffling. \u00a0And a lot of them were randomly mean. \u00a0Not even just to me, I'm saying random. \u00a0Especially girls of a certain age. \u00a0I don't know if the reader will remember this. \u00a0You can read my view of it in the chapter coming out in Phil Smith's book  Both Sides of the Table . \u00a0 \n \n But I learn a lot from pattern recognition, or trying to recognize patterns. \u00a0And if a pattern is kind of random, it takes longer. \u00a0So much about culture and enculturation and tribes and cliques and mob mentality and what makes people tick and who I am not and cannot be, I learned from being around a wide variety of people my age. \u00a0So much of what I know today that enables me to survive and thrive in real life is information of this very nature, and although I have read a lot about it and deliberately studied, my foundational learning about being able to  recognize \u00a0these things in life and put them to use in practical ways absolutely came from the brute fact of being put into situation after situation where I had to figure out how to be in the world with a wide variety of other children. \n \n It was very valuable to have my parents and other supportive relatives and adult friends of the family around to explain things to me, to demystify them, to be on my side when things were unfair, illogical, unfathomable. \u00a0It was very affirming to have them around to be interested and maybe even kind of proud when I went on and on about whatever it was that had nothing to do with what anyone else I knew would be interested in. \u00a0Or, on the other side of myself, when I said something that made no sense to anyone whatsoever and they decided to interpret it as \"poetic\" and \"creative,\" as loving adults are wont to do. \n \n Now I am an adult person living in real life and I have to ask the reader: do you think the environments I typically find myself in, such as work (all due respect to my colleagues, you are awesome) with its arcane political structures and customs, the grocery store, the dry cleaner, the road, etc. have more in common with (a) mystifying sets of people thrown together doing their thing or (b) a tight community of people who are basically kind of focusing together like a benevolent team with the apparent primary purpose of making my life as awesome and seamless as possible? \n \n Right. \u00a0So you see where I am going with that. \u00a0Well, or where I went, really. \u00a0So, having both was perfect, because I got hands on experience with what real life was going to be like, but then I got to go home and have supportive wonderful people on my side to debrief with about it. \u00a0(Life is still like that, because I married well, and we do that for each other.) \n \n From a more theoretical child development standpoint, autism is considered a developmental disability, which actually makes a lot of sense to me when translated into the old idiom \"late bloomer.\" \u00a0For me, the late bloomer-ism was social/emotional and my academic was OK, but from others, the sensory also blocks academic (the way I see it... I feel like the sensory is what blocks most of the development because whenever I get more hazy at things it is because of that bombardment, and also when I look at others who are shutting down or melting down I can see them clearly as experiencing overload. \u00a0Remember that so many of us experience emotions like a physical sense instead of like a cognitive thought. \u00a0We get sick or pained rather than confusing \"I think\" and \"I feel.\" \u00a0I should probably write a separate article about this since I have had so many conversations with friends about it. \u00a0But anyway...) \n \n So: it's to do with development. \u00a0Piaget thinks development goes like this: you get ready, and then you can do things. \u00a0Vygotsky thinks it is more like you learn by doing; doing flexes your readiness muscles into their potential. \u00a0That is an oversimplified comparison, because I love doing oversimplified comparisons, but you see what I mean. \u00a0Vygotsky, whose team I'm on, also believes learning is social. \u00a0I recommend reading some of this stuff, or starting with Joan Wink and LeAnn Putney's  A Vision of Vygotsky \u00a0for a fun, well illustrated intro. \u00a0Because of my own life experience, as well as my experience as a teacher, I also think learning is social, and you don't just magically get ready for stuff: you have to practice. \n \n Back to my life: school didn't get a chance to help me much academically, because I come from a family of intellectually curious people who fluently answered my questions and read to me until they'd saved up enough for an Encyclopaedia Britannica, at which time they added \"you can look that up!\" to their repertoire of awesome intellectual support (which also gave me countless hours of cross-referencing derailment fun). \u00a0But it was at school where I learned to find the kids that were nice to me, and the primary way of it was to find the ones with whom I had interests in common, and try to see if I could get interested in as many of the things they introduced as possible. \u00a0What many of us really had in common that I could wholeheartedly endorse was Baseball. \u00a0(More details in Phil's book. \u00a0I am not a bookseller, I just don't want to give the whole chapter away in this blog and then everyone will be bored by it when reading the book.) \u00a0School was brilliant at helping me socially. \u00a0I learned some discernment, and some adjustment, and some communication. \u00a0 \n \n I also got some desensitization. \u00a0These lessons came over and over again and some of them came at great cost, especially during middle school time when the girls get meaner and the rules harder to work out. \u00a0In high school, I couldn't take it any more, was kicked out, and moved to an alternative school situation. \u00a0Desensitization was happening at a slower rate than introduction of stressor stimuli, as they would put it in terms-like-that. \u00a0I put it in terms like that because I think part of what is good about going to school even though it can be on the nightmarish side is because it toughens you up for real life, which, I mean, not that life sucks or anything, but you have to notice it is full of loud, awkward sounds, headachy smells, social rules that are barely short of Byzantine, and why-would-you-even-create-such-painful-ugliness lighting situations, some of which include gratuitous nasty sound effects. \u00a0Well, I mean, you the reader probably didn't notice all of that, because you have special powers enabling you to ignore such stuff, and now that I have pointed it out to you, you might have to notice some of it, thereby making your life have some more annoying features. \u00a0Sorry. \u00a0Forget I said anything. \u00a0:) \u00a0 \n \n This brings me to the counterexample. \u00a0For most kids, I really do believe it is a good idea to be exposed to one another. \u00a0I believe in an inclusive world. \u00a0However, the thing about desensitization is that there has to be enough good mixed in with it to make it worth it so you don't completely shut down or melt down. \u00a0It can't be a complete and utter nightmare where you can't get anything out of it. \u00a0If that is what is it like, then you are indeed not being exposed to other kids, you are protecting yourself from any exposure to anything, because you are so bombarded and freaked out, which is the opposite of what is supposed to happen. \u00a0If I am talking about your kid, I would start smaller, like yes to the play dates, one or two kids, and some people need to organize their own educational situations in order to do this. \u00a0Also, you can increase the number of friends if and when needed, and you can pick friends who have features you want, such as a non screechy voice, an even temper, patience, an exhaustive knowledge of seventeenth century metaphysical poetry (well, or you know, something that kid and your kid can relate about). \u00a0So in some ways some people might be doing this to get their kid desensitized enough to benefit from school next year. \u00a0Alternatively, some people might live in a place where they don't trust the school system, or had a bad enough experience, or for some other reason they will continue to organize their own situation for the kids. \u00a0I still think and believe people who do this well are not isolating the children or having them only socialize with adults. \u00a0I know someone who does it very well, which is no easy task, and I will ask her to weigh in here on the comments if she feels like it, but I don't want to call her out by name in case she does not feel like it. \n \n If she does not weigh in on the comments and you the readers feel like this is your kid and you need to hear more about that aspect of things (unschooling) let me know and I will go get her and sweet-talk her into feeling like it :). \n \n If you think your kid might be more like me and benefit from school for social reasons even though it is difficult, but you want more information on how to get started on making it a benefit instead of a giant nightmare, from the parental standpoint, let me know and I will ask my mother. \u00a0I do remember coming home from school a lot with problems with mean girls or things like that. \u00a0I even remember their names (I wonder if Eric secretly remembers the names of the jackwagons whose names he decides not to utter?). \u00a0I do not remember my parents' perspective on how they made it all better because I never knew it, but you may be interested in knowing it, and actually so am I. \u00a0:) \u00a0Let me know what will work for you. \u00a0I'll just end by saying they did make it all better many times and from my perspective a lot of it had to do with Baseball. \u00a0They did a lot. \u00a0You do a lot. \u00a0I salute you. \n \n Yours socially,\u00a0 \n Ib \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "Monday, August 19, 2013", "body": "\nToday I got this beautiful letter in the e-mail. The writer offered that I should \"feel free to excerpt bits if I decide to respond,\" but the writing is so full of truth and the clarity of the murkiness that is in our lives...it seems to me the daughter in this letter is so very well understood by the writer, and so well understood also by me, myself; and I did not want to remove one word of this letter, because I also believe that the readers will understand the writer and the daughter, and may wish to answer.\u00a0 And I want to talk to my mother.\u00a0 So, readers, I offer you this letter, in its entirety, which contains important and thorny questions that are central to so many of our lives.\u00a0 Dear Devoted Phoenix, I thank you for writing, and will answer this also myself, in a column coming soon.\u00a0 Thanks everyone!\u00a0 Love, Ib \n \nNow here is that letter itself: \n \n \n \n Hi there, \n \n \n \n My \ndaughter is eleven and she was diagnosed with Asperger's this February. I\n have a hard time being brief, but I'm going to try. We didn't consult \nfor help until she was clearly having an abysmal time at school with \nother kids and literally believing she was an alien who wasn't \"made\" \nfor family and friends, kindness and respect, and wanted to die of \nloneliness and the despair of not being able to do anything right or \nalternately force her gregarious social self to become a loner who used \nher isolation to protect herself from the whole business. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n At\n five, I sent my daughter to an alternative school with a child-led \npedagogy and a beautiful community-based learning environment. Lots of \nopportunities for freedom and responsibility, leadership, creativity, \netc. I didn't know she was on the spectrum, but I did know she had a \nstrong personality and that she was likely to be singled out for it. \nPart of my hope was that she would not be labelled and pathologized at \nthis school, but rather supported in developing her strengths and the \nnecessary skills to use her personal power to be a leader without being a\n tyrant, etc. The school has done a beautiful job of focusing on her \nstrengths, but... I wish I'd had more information about her challenges \nsooner. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Now, I have a child who thinks she is a freak, who \ncontemptuously rejects the forms that consideration for others takes, as\n well as not quite grasping why these things are important (which, being\n at *least* half-aspie myself, I understand) OR who hates herself for \nnot doing the things she knows she could be doing to make relationships \nbetter and feeling deep shame and anxiety as a result. Sometimes it \nfeels like she apologizes for simply existing and being human with human\n needs. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n I want my \ndaughter to be herself and be okay, I always have. I want to celebrate \nher creativity, her caring for vulnerable beings, her beautiful voice, \nher awareness of deep subtle things, her sensitivity, her earnest \nefforts... and I want to see her less crippled by the anxiety and shame \nof trying to navigate the NT social world and failing. She tries so very\n hard, she does what seem to be the \"right\" things and still it doesn't \nwork. She doesn't trust any \"help\" to actually be helpful for her. And \nmy heart breaks because I remember my own struggles to grasp the \nimportance of manners and social graces, I remember how much it made me \nfeel like it was all about making myself small and not asking for \nanything, not expressing my truth, my feelings, my needs, pushing them \nso far away that I couldn't even identify them myself because otherwise \nthey would overwhelm me with their urgency and sabotage my efforts to \nfit in, to be safe, to stay out of trouble. I was an adult before I made\n any peace at all with these things... but I survived because I am \nacademically gifted and creative and my special interest is human \nemotion and behaviour itself. My daughter hates academics, loves art, \nand really doesn't care why people do what they do. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n I have no idea how to help her. Part of me wants to \nhelp her learn the NT social rules, not based on good or bad, but just \non the kinds of responses their presence or absence evokes in others \n(myself included). I want to support her to be able to make her way in \nthe NT world... and, I also want to be sensitive to her needs for \nintegrity, for the dignity of her own being. I want to let her be \ndifferent and celebrate that - but at 11 she sees nothing to celebrate \nin being a freak as she puts it, and none of the strengths I see in her \nmatter one iota to her in the face of her difficulties. She hates her \nAspergers, hates herself by extension, and experiences the entire world \nas mean and full of personal insult and sabotage... Trying to show her \nthat there are things she can do to help make things better with other \npeople just translates in her heart to the belief that I'm saying it's \nher fault they are mean to her. In those moments, she believes that I \nthink she deserves it. Which I most certainly do not. I don't know how \nto help, and I don't think she's ready to try to understand why other \nkids respond to her like this. It just hurts too much. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n It's so hard \nwhen we are told (and I know because of who I am) that she can learn to \nfit in and be the \"normal\" she so desperately wants to be... and yet \ntrying is such a complex proposition for her, so full of earnestness and\n anxiety and franticness and shame. And I know that, if she is anything \nlike me, the world will eventually see her as normal, expect her to *be*\n normal and know all the things instinctively that \"normal\" people know \nand do... but inside she will never quite feel she belongs, when she is \ntired and stressed, she will still transgress the rules and be seen as \nsocially inept, long-term friends will still tire of her innate \nprocessing of the world through her own experience, her use of sharing \nto connect instead of listening, and eventually object loudly or leave. \nAnd she doesn't have the self-containment that I did as a a child and \nnow. I'm not my mother and I haven't forced my daughter into a box of \nstifling social appropriateness or taught her that intense emotional \ndistress gets punished or ignored. Maybe that was a disservice, as her \npeers certainly have different ideas about those things...\u00a0 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n She is seen as normal, but spoiled and childish, \ndefiant and impulsive. Sometimes, I wonder if it's better to be seen as \none who is not \"normal\", who is atypical, who has a reason or an excuse \nto be different, but then that often translates to sympathy for a broken\n thing, and she is not broken, though she feels that way. Compassion is \nin short supply somewhere lost between unrealistic expectations and \ndismissive pity. I don't which is better/worse. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n It's taken me \nyears to get over myself in my reaction to her hostile and \n\"disrespectful\" behaviours to understand her rage as protective, to \nlearn to reach beneath it to touch her vulnerability, to discover her \ndistress, to name it so she knows she is seen, to hold her in it. Except\n now, she has learned to reach her vulnerability herself and own it, and\n she has no skills to manage her anxiety, her shame, her hurt in a world\n that doesn't see her, doesn't respond in ways she experiences as \ncaring. And she doesn't want to learn the skills she is aware that kids \nher age already know: it's humiliating for her. So she gets angry and \nresentful again.\u00a0 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n I try to get help, but I, too, am reaching a point \nwhere I don't find the help helpful. I am torn between wanting to help \nher find the motivation to learn the things that could help alleviate \nsome of her social distress (because when she wants to do something, she\n is very capable) and wanting her to have supportive help that doesn't \ntry to change her, to cultivate places that can accept and help contain \nher emotional intensity. She gets too much information about how \neverything that matters about her is wrong and in need of reshaping. She\n feels like a baby because she can't do those things. And, I'm also a \nhuman being trying to manage my own sensory overwhelm, my own needs for \nconsideration, just like the rest of the world she has to deal with. I \ncan't always accommodate, and I'm not convinced that being accommodated \nall the time would serve her, either. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n It's\n very confusing and heartbreaking and frustrating. I suppose my question\n is, with a child who has the potential to \"fit in\" with the NT world, \nand who very much wants to but tangles herself in knots trying... do I \npursue social skills training and help her shift how she presents \nherself (which she doesn't really want to do) or do I encourage her to \nbe her Aspie self when on an every day basis, even at home, her \nself-expression generally gets lost in reactions to her delivery? I want\n people to be able to see all my daughters wonderful gifts... I want her\n to be able to see them... but right now, they are so obscured by this \npressure (inside of her and out) to get it right. And she's smart enough\n to have figured out that most kids just would never accept her if she \ncontinue to approach them without fundamental changes in how she behaves\n that really go deep into who she is or isn't. She rebells or tries to \nmortgage her soul to pull it off and neither gets anyone anywhere. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n So\n much for brevity. Thanks for sitting with me long enough to read all of\n this. Feel free to excerpt bits if you decide to respond. \n \n \n \n Devoted Phoenix \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0wCeMx3D-4g/UhJSE6FUvKI/AAAAAAAAAPU/yDdt6JiAEKg/s1600/cam400.png"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2013/08/letter-from-devoted-phoenix-part-1.html", "title": "\nLetter From Devoted Phoenix, Part 1 (Letter)\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, September 29, 2012", "body": "\n I have a question regarding education. My son is 10 1/2 (he was born on \nthe same day as Emma from emmashopebook) and he is attending 6 grade \nspecial school. He is still working on his literacy, and his IEP for \nthis year has only 9 letters. I feel that he can do more, but his \nteacher assessed him as challenged in both expressive and receptive \nlanguage, especially in receptive and also as cognitively impaired, so \nshe things that he is not capable of handling more. My question here \nwould be how much I can rely on the teacher's assessment? What are your \nexperience while at school? Were the teachers able to assess you fairly \nand were your classes tailored as per your abilities? Should I be more \nassertive with my opinion, having in mind that I am not an expert, but \nagain I should know him best? But do I really know him best since he \ndoes have limited vocabulary and it is true that one can not read much \nout of his facial expression and so. \n \nAs an educator whose primary responsibility is to prepare teachers, I want to let you know that one of the first things I, and many of my colleagues, make sure to do is give pre-service teachers the gift of being aware of one of the most important educational resources on the planet: parents. \n \nNot all teachers learn that parents are resources, and some teachers are afraid of you.\u00a0 I believe this is because in society the way it is now, at least in the US, and it would not surprise me if this also applies in Macedonia, things are set up so people are at odds, at opposite sides of the table, suspicious of each other, not really playing for the same team. \n \nSome parents may believe that teachers are untouchable experts who know more than them, but some parents may also in turn believe that teachers are people who do not care about their children.\u00a0 In this country, there is a large amount of media imagery to convince the onlooker that teachers in general do not care about children--imagery created primarily for economic rather than educational reasons--but I find the uncaring teacher (though we have seen some breathtaking true examples lately!) to be more the exception than the rule.\u00a0 At any rate, either way of thinking about teachers will lead you, as a parent, not to speak up at the IEP meeting.\u00a0 Anyone seeing these reasons can imagine why. \n \nSome teachers may believe that all parents are of the opinion that teachers are uncaring and also stupid.\u00a0 Some of them believe that if they listen to parents too much, it is a set-up for a lawsuit.\u00a0 There are also some unfortunate teachers who seem to believe that parents do not know their own children, or that parents think their children are angels of perfection but they cannot really see them; but I also find that when they think it through, this too is rare.\u00a0 These kinds of beliefs will lead teachers to avoid opportunities to ask parents for input when creating IEP goals.\u00a0 Anyone seeing these reasons can imagine why. \n \nSeeing the reasons people do not work well on teams for the children helps to understand why it is happening, but seeing what is really more likely to be true in real life, I hope, will help people work better together.\u00a0 This essay is a simplified version but I am hoping that anyone who reads it will have an easier time in IEP meetings from now on. \n \nIn real life, parents know their children very well and are an excellent resource for teachers when it comes to understanding the kids as individual people, which is something we should all want to strive for doing to a T.\u00a0 In countries such as the United States where teachers are becoming economically devalued, parents can also be a tremendous ally in other ways.\u00a0 (Just a little something to think about if you are a teacher.) \n \nIn real life, teachers decided to become teachers instead of choosing other careers for a constellation of reasons, one of the chief ones more than likely being because they care about children.\u00a0 Then, they embarked on an educational path which gave them specific pedagogical expertise.\u00a0 Many teachers have chosen to get advanced degrees and are very passionate about keeping up with the literature and conferences allowing them to stay abreast of the most excellent ways to teach children and help them succeed.\u00a0 Their work conditions are becoming steadily worse in many places for economic reasons and they frequently purchase school supplies out of pocket in order to keep up the necessary educational experiences for the students.\u00a0 (If you are a parent, there may be a multitude of ways to help in the classroom in addition to being the one who knows your child best.) \n \nIn real life, a child is a little person.\u00a0 In order to do the best job teaching him or her, ideally you want the best of everything.\u00a0 You want the best of pedagogical knowledge and education skills that a teacher can bring, but is that enough?\u00a0 Not quite.\u00a0 You want to really know that kid, know what makes him or her tick.\u00a0 Is that enough, by itself?\u00a0 Not usually.\u00a0 But when you put those two things together, magic can happen.\u00a0 This is what happens when great teachers work with great parents: You have both things together.\u00a0 And everyone learns a little something... and the child learns a lot.\u00a0 And that is who we are there for. \n \nYou asked about my educational experiences.\u00a0 There's a book coming out called Both Sides of The Table edited by Phil Smith in which I have written a chapter about my life in school, which says more.\u00a0 But I'll give you a tiny relevant preview that fits here, about two people I can pinpoint making a huge difference, and when it happened, and what happened. \n \nFirst let me say this: my parents absolutely helped out at school and got involved and told their truth.\u00a0 So that is why my mother was there to notice up close when an absolutely magnificent teacher came to our school.\u00a0 She was the school librarian, Mrs. Gladstone.\u00a0 To make a long story very short, Mrs. Gladstone (Beau) is my mother's best friend, and I am here now writing an Educational Blog. \n \nMaja, I think you should give the teachers the benefit of your wisdom, in a spirit of friendship, and see how things work out from there.\u00a0 Meanwhile, I will be researching the second part of your question, about bilingualism (the literature I know has bilingualism being useful instead of confusing but I want to be optimally thorough and useful).\u00a0 Tell me how everything goes!! \n \nAll the best, \nIb \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2012/09/parents-and-iep.html", "title": "\nParents and the IEP\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, September 27, 2012", "body": "\n \n My\nten year old daughter, Emma is reading at a second grade level, (or so) but\nwhen she is given reading comprehension questions on her homework she gets very\nfrustrated, bites her hand the minute she sees the homework. I only mention\nthis to indicate her level of anxiety. Do you have any tips for me in working\nwith her on reading comprehension? Are there ways I can make this less\nstressful?\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThis\nis a complex question, because there are several points in the process during\nwhich the anxiety could be addressed, and I want to talk about assessment a\nlittle bit, and also what happens with \"reading comprehension\" when\ncertain things are not taken into account.\u00a0 I will start as a person who\nteaches assessment courses and has colleagues who are reading specialists with\nwhom I converse frequently, and when I get to the examples and start talking\nabout anxiety, you may notice a bit of Autistic awesomeness coming into\nplay.\u00a0 ;)\u00a0 I'll talk about what you can ask for at school and what\nyou can do as a mother at home if the homework stays exactly the same.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, I'll make giant assumptions about the homework since I haven't seen\nit, but I have seen a lot of reading comprehension homework in general. \n \n \n \nIt\nis notoriously difficult to assess reading comprehension, especially using the\nkinds of assessment that are currently considered the most valuable because\nthey are able to be standardized easily and take the least amount of time to\nadminister, etc.\u00a0 Another thing to take into account is that special\neducators and reading teachers are often taught to teach reading in very\ndifferent ways.\u00a0 That is to scaffold the discussion. \n \n \n \nAs\nI said, I have not seen the homework, but usually it will consist of a list of\nsome specific questions which, if the child \"did and understood the\nreading,\" he or she would presumably have been able to answer correctly\nfrom the text, given the right amount of the complex set of skills we call\n\"reading comprehension.\" \n \n \n \nThis\nmay be wrong, but I'll construct one of the very most common types for the sake\nof answering. If the homework is so different as to render this part of the\nanswer toothless, let me know and I'll go back and see what's what.\u00a0 OK\nso.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \nText: \n \n \n \nJack\nand Jill/Went up the hill/To fetch a pail of water;/Jack fell down,/Broke his\ncrown/And Jill came tumbling after. \n \n \n \nComprehension\nQuestions: (Slightly exaggerated for emphasis, but man, I'm telling you, only\nslightly.) \n \n \n1. Where did Jack and Jill go? \n2. Jack and Jill fetched (circle one): a. lemonade b. water c. alligator\nshoes d. none of the above \n3. If you were Jack, how might you feel in the fifth line? \n4. Circle the event that happened first: a. they fell down the hill b. they\ngot water \n \nNow, as healthy Autistic-American ;), I have answered the first fine, but am\nderailed on number 2.\u00a0 It doesn't say in the story they actually fetched\nthe water; it only says they intended to do so.\u00a0 Also, why would you go up\nthe hill for this?\u00a0 Since they are using a pail, they may be going to a\npump or a well, and in either case, placing the thing uphill would cause the diggers\nto have to work harder to get to the water table. Argh, skip to the next\nquestion.\u00a0 3. ARGH! He might feel all sorts of different ways breaking his\ncrown.\u00a0 We do see he is the kind of royal who tries to fetch his own\nwater, so maybe he is glad not to be saddled with marks of his class-guilt all\nover his head.\u00a0 Maybe his father is the one who made the workers put the\nwell on the hill and work twice as hard.\u00a0 Is this an allegory? I don't\nhave any evidence either way!!!!!!! Skip to 4 for now... 4b I TOLD YOU THERE IS\nNO EVIDENCE THEY ACTUALLY GOT THE WATER!\u00a0 MY STOMACH HURTS!\u00a0 What is\nwrong with my eyes?\u00a0 I need to get out of here. AAAAAAAAUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!! \n \nThe teacher is able to see that I am only able to read the first two lines\nof Jack and Jill.\u00a0 My family is able to see that reading comprehension\nhomework makes me sick and anxious.\u00a0 The more of it I do, the sooner I get\nanxious.\u00a0 Soon, I don't even bother looking at it to see if it is logical\nthis time.\u00a0 This probably takes like three iterations. \n \nIf this assessment had been taken without me freaking out, the teacher would\nhave gotten the useful information that I believe the crown mentioned in line 5\nis a masculine tiara rather than a body part, as well as that I have a\npotentially useful aptitude for critical thinking and searching for evidence.\nNot only that, but I am more interested in social studies than some of my\npeers, which might cause me to want to socialize.\u00a0 You never know. \n \nHow could the assessment have been done to gather that information instead\nof freaking me out? \n \nAuthentic and portfolio assessment styles exist for this purpose, and my\nfavorites involve retelling customized to the kid's strengths. If I am good at\ndrawing, I am asked to draw a picture about the story after I read it.\u00a0\nLater, looking at the picture, I'm asked to tell you the story.\u00a0 The\npicture will remind me the elements of the story that were salient to me.\u00a0\nI will tell you that Jack and Jill went up the hill to get water, which why\nwould they do that, because the water table would be harder to reach from\nthere, and then Jack broke his crown.\u00a0 Did he break it because he made\npeople dig twice as hard for no reason? Because that was unfair.\u00a0 You can\nask me to clarify what on earth I am talking about.\u00a0 I can tell you that\nif a king or a queen makes people work too hard that might make his crown fall\noff, like in that song.\u00a0 You can ask me to sing you the song.\u00a0 Now\nyou know I do not know the body part \"crown.\"\u00a0 You know music might reach me and etc.\u00a0 Writer kids often rewrite the story, or kids can act it out or make up songs about it.\u00a0 It is a fun style to experiment with, and you learn a lot more about what the kids really think the story says than you can ever learn from a list of questions.\u00a0 The teachers may let you do the homework like that if you ask them.\u00a0 They may say that this is what they do in school but they wouldn't want to put that on people's families.\u00a0 You may say, that is awesome.\u00a0 This is the best case scenario.\u00a0 Let me know how it goes. \n \nNow, more normal scenario, the homework stays how it is and you really just need an answer to the part about the anxiety.\u00a0 And you read along about the reading stuff and kind of laughed and things but you were like, dang, is she going to be able to answer questions after all?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 I will. \n \nAre there ways you can make the exact thing less stressful? \n \nYes, and I do it to myself a lot.\u00a0 It is called \"desensitization\" and comes from a field of study whose other inventions I am not normally as much in love with, but this one is good, has been good for me in my life.\u00a0 The basic idea is to always pair the stressful thing with something enormously and fabulously the opposite of stressful.\u00a0 For Emma, let's say the homework sheet of reading comprehension homework never shows up without the most amazing, bass-booming dance track.\u00a0 And you are dancing.\u00a0 And you wave that thing over your head with two hands woot woot Chelsea style.\u00a0 What you do in the long run is get it closer and closer to the stressor event but by then the ick has worn off.\u00a0 It can take a while... don't rush it... The first time you dance with it, I mean, you don't even try to do it.\u00a0 The next time, mayyybe you sing a question.\u00a0 Don't worry about getting an answer.\u00a0 Get closerrrrrr as it gets less worrisome.\u00a0 Sing a question and cock your head.... Closerrr..... Over a few sessions.... This is how I became able to drive a car, incidentally.\u00a0 This is how I have done many things.\u00a0 So then in Emma's life, Homework Is Stress gives way to Homework Is An Experimental Dance Genre.\u00a0 When she is a singer on the stage, you will see some choreography about it sweep the nation.... \n \nThis association of a stressor with something relaxing and awesome works better the more super awesome the person considers the excellent thing.\u00a0 Try it with yourself.\u00a0 You can even do it in your head.\u00a0 For example, the next time I see someone I am likely to frown at, I can mentally put the person on a John Deere tractor, because, you know, high awesome factor.\u00a0 Then I will probably smile instead of frown.\u00a0 This is adding method-acting to the desensitization, because the techniques are related.\u00a0 But I wanted to clarify it because I only did one example.  \n \nAnother kid might super love the Mets, and whenever the homework comes out, you are suddenly dressed as if the Mets had a special designer line.\u00a0 You might keep the stuff in a special edition Mets folder, etc.\u00a0 The key is baby steps and pairing the irritant with the thing that is relaxing and beloved so the halo effect rubs off on it. \n \nOver and out for now! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2012/09/reading-comprehension-assessment-and.html", "title": "\nReading Comprehension Assessment and Anxiety\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, September 30, 2012", "body": "\n A friend of mine wrote a post about her journey from cure to acceptance \nthat TPGA posted a couple of weeks ago, one of the people who commented \non her post, said she'd \"recovered\" her child who was now, 5 years \nlater, indistinguishable from their peers and then said, \"I chose to \nfight, you chose \"acceptance\".  This is not an uncommon remark.  I've \nheard it said in various ways and of course the implication is that \nthose who \"choose\" acceptance have not fought hard enough or we too \nwould have \"recovered\" children and that those who do \"recover\" their \nchildren have a stronger love than those who do not.  This kind of \nlanguage is not only confusing to new parents (and old) but it is \nhurtful on so many levels, not just to the parents, but their children \nwho will carry that hurt well into adulthood.  Parents turning on one \nanother in this kind of adult version of Lord of the Flies makes MY \nteeth hurt!   And we wonder why children bully (another topic!) One\n other thing I just want to mention is that the way Autism is currently \nperceived, as a tragedy, as frightening etc, also encourages parents to \nentertain their worst fears for their children.  This is something I \ngrappled with for YEARS.  I was led to believe (and I know I am not \nalone in this) that if I didn't try every treatment option out there, \nwhen I died my child would end up in an institution.  This may sound \nridiculous, overly dramatic, even hyperbolic to many reading this, but I\n can tell you honestly this thought, this horrifying fear plagued me for\n years.\u00a0 \n \n It isn't hyperbolic. The medical \nmodel history of treating parents to a giant dog-and-pony show about how \nhorrible your child's life will be (and by extension, what an \nunspeakably evil person you are) if you don't give a good number of them\n a lot of money and stat! is relatively recent, but very potent, and very deliberate. Several lines of \nprofessional activity have been built on its foundation, and, believe it\n or not, I believe a great many of the mid- and lower echelon \npractitioners really believe they are helping your child by emotionally \nmanipulating you: they have been taught that way themselves, and emotionally and intellectually manipulated along similar lines.  I also believe there are some very unscrupulous \nhappenings happening, and people who by the light of ordinary morality \nought to have trouble being around themselves.\u00a0 In other words, there are some people doing that manipulating who know they are doing it and are blame-worthy.\u00a0 This is not a conspiracy theory, by the way; it is simply enculturation. \n \n I saw the thread with the comment you're talking about, and it breaks my heart.\u00a0 It's a clear example of some of the fallout that happens when society makes parenting into a zero-sum competition.\u00a0 Also, it indicates to me that at some level people are aware they are being sold a bill of goods, or they would not feel the need to scream so loudly at others who are not buying.\u00a0 There are certain things I like to do with my kids, but I don't feel like less of a person if I don't strong-arm you into doing the exact same things, and validating me while you are at it.\u00a0 But this may also be because I am sort of a watcher on the sidelines of a dominant culture where this seems to be done with almost everything.\u00a0 Do you have the right car? Clothes? Shoes? Children? \n \n No? Then you're not good enough.\u00a0 Now, give me some money and lots of it, and let me make you feel like more of a person for a second.\u00a0 (Maybe I'm saying this because I made it up and I am an evil manipulator, or maybe more likely because I am a True Believer who drives that car and wears those shoes and now that I get calls from the creditors all the time I need to know I made the right choice...)\u00a0 Well, it could be for some other reason.\u00a0 But the reasons I have listed are frequently-occurring and interesting studies back them up, particularly the latter (cognitive dissonance and Concorde fallacy studies, for example).\u00a0 However, the fact that the Normalcy of Your Child is part of What Makes You A Person and is decided by Medicine and Psychology is what I am really talking about and saying is relatively recent, historically. Prior to the \nmedical model of emotionally manipulating parents into bullying one \nanother, it was basically left almost entirely up to religious \norganizations (I'll talk about the Western world here, for \ntime/space/complexity/parallelism considerations) to manipulate parents \ninto bullying one another by intoning that their disabled children were \nalready some kind of punishment and that things would be somewhat \nforgiven if large donations were to be made to said religious \norganization and/or the other villagers did bad things to the family \nshowing lack of allegiance... This model prevailed for hundreds of years\n and--I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw this for myself just the\n other day--still has a few conceptual adherents.\u00a0 So, in the old days before Medicine decided who counts as a person and how, Religion decided who counts as a person and how.\u00a0 Is this right? Fortunately, \nboth models have been widely ignored by groups of cool people.  We have some \nevidence that in many places, villagers frequently overlooked such teachings and \ninclusively considered \"simpletons\" and other people with disabilities to be full fledged \nmembers of the community, particularly as they were able carry out some role figured out for them for the group as making sense, such as courier, or bouncer, or farm hand.  (The language does not always seem to have \ncarried the same aesthetic.)  Today, many parents reject the ethos of \nthe medical model and use medicine for what it is good for: ameliorating\n symptoms of illness, getting people well from actual diseases and things like that, instead of deciding to agree\n that entire ways of being \"Other\" should be branded as sicknesses that \nneed to be cured out of existence. It is currently considered \ngauche for adults to bully children (though some inexplicably do it \nanyway).  This may be why they bully each other so readily.  When a child with disabilities grows up, it is a good idea for him or her to \nbe prepared to take on this bullying, denial of basic rights, \ndehumanization, etc.  As a parent, it is a good idea to give your \nchildren self-advocacy skills with all your might, which includes \nmodeling them yourself.  Don't let yourself be bullied.  If you need \nhelp from the Autistic Community, give us a shout-out, and we will have \nyour back. My favorite books about the above are Foucault's Birth of the Clinic and James Trent's Inventing the Feeble Mind.\u00a0 Recommended reading! I\n mention these and wrote this whole answer (then decided to add to it and repost for all, in case people don't see in-comment conversations) as another way of saying that\n these lies have been going on for ages; and I especially want to announce with vigor and gusto that parents have more power \nthan they think, and I love it when they use it against wrongness in the\n establishment instead of against each other. \n \n Parents and \"Others,\" Unite! \n \n Love,\u00a0 \n Ib \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2012/09/scare-tactics-divide-and-conquer.html", "title": "\nScare Tactics: Divide and Conquer\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 30, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Hi,\n I don't know if this is the right place to ask a new question, but it \nwas the only comment box I found. Thank you so much for being willing to\n share your experience and knowledge! My question is very different from\n the previous one. My son, just turned 16, was dx'd \"Asperger's\" just \nover 3 years ago when hospitalized for depression and escalating \nbehavior. (He was always labelled \"gifted\" and \"ADHD\", and in mainstream\n public school, with gradually worsening social experiences, compliance,\n and acting out behavior.) After the ASD diagnosis, things started \nimproving as we learned what his needs were, but since he started high \nschool he is gradually getting worse - school refusal, putting his head \ndown on the desk, decreased cooperation at home, increased stimming and \nmeltdowns (I have a fresh hole in my wall). At a recent IEP meeting, he \ntold the 18 adults at the table that he'd done better in the one ESE \nclass he'd been in (learning strategies), because it was \"smaller, \nquieter and more individualized.\" The IEP staffing specialist told him \nflatly that this was impossible for them to provide him. They produced a\n behavior plan requiring a certain amount of work in order for him to \nhave his full time at lunch with his friends. I asked what they would do\n to meet his sensory needs, and they looked at me like I was crazy. I \nmentioned the quiet office with the upholstered chair that he used to be\n able to go to sometimes in middle school, and they said I was trying to\n move him backwards. They also said that his behavior was more defiance \nthan whatever else I'm trying to think it might be (despondency, \nperhaps?)  I kind of had my own meltdown at the meeting and we \nrescheduled the meeting to finish up next week. Predictably, my son is \nnow on strike and has done even less work in school. I was wishing so \nhard for an autistic adult to ask for advice, and here you are! I know \nyou don't know my son, but can you tell me anything you are pretty sure I\n should ask for at the meeting? We have accommodations of less \nhandwriting and note taking, teachers email me daily to help me keep up \nwith his assignments, and he has an extra day to turn work in if needed. Sorry this is so long, and thanks for listening! \n Carol \n \n \n \nGood questions and familiar to me in my life, Carol. When is the meeting? \n \n \n \n \n The next meeting date hasn't been finalized yet, but the deadline is Nov. 3.\u00a0 \n \n Thanks, Carol \n \n \n \n \n \n Dear Carol, \u00a0 \n \n I\n will definitely write back in plenty of time so you will feel maximally\n ready for the meeting.  Also, I'll talk to my mom (Hi Mom, I know you \nare already reading this!) and see if she also has any extra additional \nadvice to add for what you should say that she remembers from this time \nin our lives.As a preview, they don't really have the legal \nright to ignore you and act like you are crazy and all of that.  As his \nparent you are someone they need to really be listening to and taking \nnotes and following your lead.  This is actually the way the laws are \nset up, and don't let their attitudes fool you.  I am very sorry these \nparticular ones are copping an attitude, but I am happy to report that \ntruth that when you go back into that meeting you can go in there with \nthe new knowledge that you and your son together really have the right \nto OWN it.  And if you are on the same page you can do a double-team \nSUPER OWN.OK, I will write more soon, but think about that and \nfor now, talk to him and ask him what would be his super dream outcome \nif I am right about you and him OWNING the next meeting, and see what \nyou can come up with.  Make a list.  This list is going to be realer \nthan you think. \u00a0 \n \n Best, Ib \u00a0 \n \n \n Thank\n you! He and I will have a confab. I think that part of the problem is \nthat he is so smart, and often contributes good comments in class, so no\n one believes that when he puts his head down he isn't just being lazy. \nThis is complicated by the fact that like most teens, he CAN be lazy. \nThey also have never qualified him for ESE under the autism label, but \nrather under ADHD....their evaluations didn't reveal autism as having an\n educational impact. And, regardless of label, they observe that \nsometimes he can perform, so they seem to expect that he will always do \nso. He is also depressed and recently started therapy, and is on meds \n(which I hate) because his meltdowns were getting scary...I truly \nbelieve that if schol were less sressful he wouldn't need so much \nmedicating. I'd homeschool him, but I can't quit work. \u00a0 \n \n The next \nmeeting is set for Nov. first. So far all our requests are simple, like \nhaving one day a week to turn in all work to one person (executive \nfunctioning being a big issue), and accessing any online assignments at \nschool, to reduce the number of modalities he has to remember to use at \nhome. Thanks again for your generous spirit. And may I add, I've been \nreading your older posts and I love love love your writing! \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n Dear Carol, \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \n First off, thanks so much for that compliment :)\u00a0 I am blushing :) :) :).\u00a0 I am what they call a \"reluctant writer,\" and your encouragement means  sooooo  much to me.  So I talked to my Mom, and just as I suspected, you are doing a bang-up job.\u00a0 Those were her exact words.\u00a0 She says hang in there.\u00a0 Your story made her laugh with bittersweet recognition because that is so much like hers and my teenager story.\u00a0 Times ahead may be a bit rough (she said to add \"er, say ' very  rough'\") but you are doing everything right, and I was let's just say a little on the difficult side at this age, and I am not going to let Mom add anything here in case it is more dramatic than that, but suffice it to say check out how I am doing now if you are in the mood for some Happy Hope, Marty McFly style.\u00a0 This is not to be confused with myself bragging in front of any naysayer high school teachers and administration from the past who may or may not be reading this and were misinformed back in the day and not helpful and tried to ignore my parents and act like they were crazy, if ever there were any such people, which if there were, I'm sure they are not related or bearing any resemblance to anyone actually alive or living they may resemble, but rather are embodied by actors, and not to be copied and played on your DVD for financial gain or otherwise without express written permission of the FBI or MGM.\u00a0 Disclaimer accomplished.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n OK so: I will tell you why you are doing everything right from both of our perspectives, and give you a little more information about your rights and some hopefully helpful analogies you can use to get people you are talking to, to be able to understand things better in real life. \u00a0 \n \n When I was extremely similar to your kid, the protections under the law did not extend to situations like ours, because it was such a long time ago and people like us were not so famous that people knew the names and listed them under the IDEA Categories and so forth.\u00a0 ;).\u00a0 You have that advantage now and I am going to help you use it.\u00a0 When you have rights, by golly, work them. \u00a0 \n \n But before I do that I want to give you a major cyber fist bump of another thing that makes you awesome.\u00a0 You mention that your son CAN be lazy.\u00a0 The reason this is so awesome to me is that it shows how much you totally see him as a complete person.\u00a0 Not he IS lazy, that or a no-hoper and can't do one darn thing of his own ever because he is a giant walking disability of tragic proportions, and also not that he is a super angel of otherworldly inspiration, bathed in the blue light of the mysterious puzzle piece of our dreamy-eyed kind.\u00a0 He's a kid, your son, you get him.\u00a0 And I really, really love that.\u00a0 You do not dehumanize him in any direction.\u00a0 And though he probably treats you a little on the heinous-rude-not-thoughtful side sometimes, because he is a teenager and that is what teenagers may have a tendency to do, I just want to report to you from the future that he will notice that you have not dehumanized him, he is likely secretly noticing now, unbeknownst to either of you, and he will remember, and it is making an important difference in the way he sees himself and what he can become.\u00a0 Just hold that knowledge in your head and in your heart because it is going to come in handy in time to come. \u00a0 \n \n Just a break for station identification.\u00a0 I really love the people who write in to this blog.\u00a0 You folks make my day.\u00a0 I wonder if there is a secret subtitle that I'd forgotten having put on there that says something like Blog for Awesome People to Ask Questions.\u00a0 OK, back to your regularly scheduled programming. \u00a0 \n \n Autism has an educational impact.\u00a0 Sensory issues have an educational impact.\u00a0 Executive function barriers are barriers.\u00a0 You are right about all that. \u00a0 \n \n Sometimes well-meaning people who think in a very linear way about \"progress\" in learning do not know these things, and you can help them, because your ideas are right on the money.\u00a0 I am going to speak from analogy about what your story sounded like to me, using substitution of precisely related concepts, and you can tell people this, because it might help them see what we are up against here.\u00a0 I will not go totally echolalic, but will get very very close, only just make it shorter and stick to the most salient ultra shocking part.\u00a0 Here goes: \u00a0 \n \n Analogy Carolmom: My son, who uses a wheelchair for all locomotion, just started in high school, and has been having severe attendance issues.\u00a0 Middle school was a lot better once they became ADA compliant and installed the right ramps and all of that.\u00a0 He just told the 18 adults at the IEP meeting that classes in middle school were easier for him to attend as they were on the first floor instead of up two flights of stairs and thus it was \"possible to get into the room\".\u00a0 When I as his mother suggested perhaps they could fix the elevator, if the first floor was not an option, they acted like I was crazy and flatly said all of that was impossible and I was trying to move him backwards. \u00a0  They say he is defiant.\u00a0 He never attends class, and for some reason seems to have given up, even at home (perhaps become despondent?).\u00a0 What can I do? \u00a0 \n \n Me: They said what the whattin' what?!? \u00a0 \n \n Sensory and executive function barriers to learning are barriers to learning, and people do not have them on purpose in order to be defiant.\u00a0 It is not fun to have them. \u00a0  The reason we have special educational protections under the IDEA is so that teams can get together and provide accommodations and modifications to remove barriers to learning and allow students to access the curriculum.\u00a0 If the barrier is physical ,  accommodations will address that.\u00a0 Neurological barriers are sort of physical, by the way.\u00a0 Brain scientists can locate a lot of that stuff.\u00a0 My friend  Judy Willis, MD , who does not focus on autism but is one of the most knowledgeable and fascinating people you will ever meet, is both a neurologist and a teacher.\u00a0 Check out her studies and see what all they can know.\u00a0 For one thing, separate issue, but related, you can learn and retain a lot more when you are pairing it with a positive affect instead of living out a nightmare situation.\u00a0 I learned that from Judy (we were in the same writer's group at  SCWriP  which is part of the  National Writing Project  and extremely cool). \u00a0 \n \n Here is another important aspect I noticed about your story, Carol.\u00a0 Your son is already an excellent self-advocate.\u00a0 However, he was, as you were, blatantly ignored by a giant room full of people.\u00a0 This is liable to contribute to despondency.\u00a0 I still hate it when it happens to me, and have to fight against the idea that it is not worth it.\u00a0 There are still ableists and jackwagons in academia, believe it or not, even in my field.\u00a0 Of course I am sure any resemblance between them and anyone living or dead is entirely coincidental and the FBI, etc.... But he and you should continue speaking the truth, because you are right about it.\u00a0 And it IS worth it.\u00a0 It is.\u00a0 Tell him I told you.\u00a0 It gets better when you get older.\u00a0 It doesn't get gone, but it gets better.\u00a0 You get more powerful and can sort of make people listen more, more of the time.\u00a0 And you can help make people listen to others.\u00a0 It is worth it. \u00a0 \n \n Autism does have an effect on academic work, particularly because of sensory and executive functioning barriers.\u00a0 Yes it does.\u00a0 But not in all cases, and not all the time, and not if it is well-managed and provided for with accommodations and modifications allowing access to the curriculum, as ramps and elevators do with wheelchairs.\u00a0 When quiet spaces and safe zones and plans B and executive functioning supports and simplification scaffolds are not provided.... well, here is something that happened to me just this morning.\u00a0 They are supposed to tell me ahead of time if there is going to be a fire drill during class or office hours, so I can adjust (dull) my senses in anticipation (this falls under a \"Plan B\" because there will be fire drills no matter what, but I do have the ability to create temporary sensory dullness in myself with sufficient forewarning.\u00a0 Many of us do).\u00a0 Because of staff changes, this warning unfortunately didn't happen at all, so giant riotous unexpected piercing intolerable mind-ruining klaxons went off right in the middle of what was previously a math pedagogy class, with me surprised at full supersensitive ultrahearing.\u00a0 Gack. \u00a0 \n \n The good news is, this was a class full of people who want to be special educators, and several of them have kids on the spectrum, so they got to see a sensory meltdown in situ naturally provided by providence, and see what they could do to best help out in such a scenario.\u00a0 They aced it, I am happy to say.\u00a0 Next week we can have a debrief about it, etc.\u00a0 But, I will just let you guess whether I was able to provide pearls of wisdom in a calm, engaging tone of confidence and linguistic command right after that happened... \u00a0 \n \n So, to make a long story short, you are asking for very good things in the realm of executive functioning.\u00a0 But you and he also have every right to ask for the quiet room because, \"That is impossible\" is not a real answer to the request for a quiet, safe, smaller room in a normal building.\u00a0 When I read that I was thinking, what is this school, a yurt?\u00a0 A yurt and there are none of those pie dividers?\u00a0 Because, seriously, buildings have rooms.\u00a0 That is a well-known feature of buildings.\u00a0 Or maybe it is like a super giant echoing warehouse that doesn't even have a bathroom or an electrical closet?\u00a0 Dude.\u00a0 \"That is impossible\"??!!??\u00a0 No, it isn't.\u00a0 It isn't impossible.\u00a0 It is important. \u00a0 \n \n Two reasons it is important.\u00a0 Reason one: it the same kind of thing as is the ramp, or the elevator.\u00a0 It is the removal of the barrier that sensory over-stimulation causes to learning.\u00a0 Reason two: it is not OK to stomp all over the self-advocacy efforts of a teenager.\u00a0 This boy is  engaged and involved. \u00a0 This is actually  dreamy  and they should  relish  it.\u00a0 It is the opposite of defiant.\u00a0 I have never been able to hear my own self speak, but I will tell you this, I do not recall ever as a teenager being able to deliberately help adults understand me as well as your son is doing.\u00a0 Myself, I was not clear on what was going on with me, and as best I can recall, I said things that would have seemed cryptic and non-useful, such as \"I can't\" and \"There are no windows\" and \"It's... there's not enough music\" and \"I'm sorry\" and possibly, if I got up the gumption to say it out loud (I have to check with my mother) \"I just can't see the point.\"\u00a0 I know that last thing was in my mind. \u00a0 \n \n Your son, miraculously, has a part of him that still sees the point.\u00a0 He is trying to advocate for himself for a place at the table, for the barriers to his learning to be removed from his high school experience.\u00a0 His teachers are probably well-meaning, and now, I hope, they will become well-educated.\u00a0 If there are further problems please feel free to have them contact me because I believe they want what is best for him but just had a conceptual glitch about what constitutes an educational barrier for a neuro-diverse student.\u00a0 If you tell them what I said here and there are further problems, I may not have expressed things sufficiently well and would be happy to try more analogies or bring up studies. \u00a0 \n \n So this is, in a nutshell, why I think that the things you have already said, in addition to the things on the list you are coming up with together, should be the things you ask for, and you should also bring up some of the things I have said in case the analogy helps get the point across that by asking for barriers to learning to be removed, you are NOT taking him backwards, you are allowing him to move forwards, and you are also supporting his efforts at self-advocacy, which is something that is valuable and always to be supported, because when you lose that, he will be ever so much more difficult, and that is probably why my Mom said \"be sure to put VERY,\" because she was talking about me back then, and I did not self advocate properly, and that took AGES for me to get my life together as a result, because how could people help me?\u00a0 Your son is not like that.\u00a0 He is with you, telling people.\u00a0 Right on to that! \u00a0 \n \n Best of luck to you.\u00a0 I didn't want to wait until seeing the list you guys make up because I wanted you to have time to mull over this and write back if you wanted.\u00a0 But if you want to write back with the list I will be very interested :). \u00a0 \n \n Best,  Ib \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.edutopia.org/user/19536",

{"date": "Friday, September 28, 2012", "body": "\n I have a (negative)\n visceral reaction to the word \"recovered\" as in, \"recovered from \nautism.\" But I have heard this word used by the same parents who do \ntheir utmost to help their autistic children (they are usually the ones \nwho will also not say \"autistic children\" because they prefer \"children \nwith autism\"). I prefer the expression \"shed the diagnosis\" \nbecause I view this as more accurate. But I am very, very confused as to\n the way I can \"frame\" my thinking around autism as a newly dx'ed \nparent. Can you give me some pointers on how to frame my \nthinking, or is this all a matter of semantics and I'm letting this \nbother me more than necessary? \n \nThere might be two simultaneous related directions in which I could help you frame your thinking, for the purpose of helping you not be distracted by the fact that this bothers you, because these things have banged around in my ears and head for a long time.   But I really hope it doesn't stop bothering you altogether, because you are actually right that \"shed the diagnosis\" is more accurate... for something.\u00a0 When I was in my salad days, it was even a goal of mine.\u00a0 Now I believe there are even better things than shedding diagnoses.\u00a0 \"Recovered\" is a good word for what my best friend, who is an upholsterer, did to  these chairs.  (If you are in Seattle, do look around that site in case you ever need something done.\u00a0 Jennifer is brilliant.) \n \nI'm going to put a little bit more of the follow up information on your question in here so everyone is reading the same page: \n \n My child went through an \nintensive intervention which helped his ability to verbally express \nhimself. This same program exposed me to other parents of young children\n on the spectrum and the prevailing attitude (I don't think I exaggerate\n when I say predominantly \"fix/cure.\") When I casually mentioned that I \ndidn't believe autism has a \"cure\" (because I don't subscribe to a \ndisease model of autism), one parent said to me, \"You're wrong! They can\n be cured!\" Maybe it is because this is still \"early\" on for me, \nthat I'm dealing with what seems like basic premises. Yet such basic \npremises, and philosophical differences therein, drives a lot of my \ndecision when looking at where I get my support and knowledge about \nautism from. So for me it's become a bigger deal than I anticipated. \n \n This is a tremendously big deal and you are not being unnecessarily picky or anything like that.\u00a0 It seems to me like your thinking is quite good and you are standing in a hurricane of conflicting talk and conceptualization, and while it may seem basic to you in the \"early\" sense, I think you also sense that it is basic in the fundamental sense that people are forging new identities and potential inadvertent barriers for themselves and their families around these choices, which they unfortunately do not often experience as chosen choices. \n \n That you see yourself able to choose at this early stage is a remarkable gift.\u00a0 Society is not geared for that.\u00a0 I salute you. \n \n There is no cure for autism.\u00a0 If there were, most autistic people would not choose to be cured of something so intrinsic to them as their neurological makeup and all that follows from that, such as views of the world, ways of thinking, and so on.\u00a0 There is an Autistic Culture, and Autistic Community. \n \n I no longer want to shed the diagnosis, because then I would not be a member of the culture where people understand why I like to type instead of talking on the phone and so forth, for one thing, and are more likely to get my sense of humor, and straight up answer when I say, \"What do you mean?\" instead of saying something like, \"You're kidding, right?\" \n \n Sometimes when people hear this sort of thing, they show signs of imagining that whoever is saying it is only able to say it because of being what they call \"high functioning,\" which I take to mean something like, 'currently fluent in verbal expression'.\u00a0 I used to take it to mean employed full-time, but what with the economy lately....\u00a0 However, I know many people in the Autistic Community who type all the total time and verbally or orally speak never, or super minimally, and have expressed the exact same kind of sentiments I am typing right now.\u00a0 Also, you know I am a professor, because it is in my profile, so you know I talk.\u00a0 But if you did not know that, you would only have evidence that I type.\u00a0\u00a0 This is the case online: you may not know who is not so much of a talker.\u00a0 So when people imagine that only certain kinds of Autistics have lives worth living, lives they like living just as their own selves, it is a misunderstanding, and incorrect. \n \n In the old days I wanted to shed the diagnosis because I did not know there was a community.\u00a0 This was before the internet and I was the only person I knew who was so much like myself.\u00a0 Other people I knew who were Autistic had grown up in the Institution that was closing.\u00a0 We got along great and enjoyed a related sense of humor, but they had institutional culture, and I felt like I needed to husband and leverage the small amount of social power I had available to me because the stigma was so amazingly strong in those days.\u00a0 People with disabilities were treated like children.\u00a0 Everyone was shocked at the idea of including them in safer sex/AIDS prevention education, for example, because obviously nobody with intellectual or developmental disabilities would ever have a libido or etc.\u00a0 (See how I said \"them\" there?\u00a0 That's what it was like, then.) \n \n There are two cultural or community situations which are to various degrees analogous to this one (Autistic) that have been around longer and may help to think about.\u00a0 The primary analogy is that one gets a ticket to the culture because of the way one is, but one's parents often are not that way, and also there is a history of stigma and misunderstanding wherein groups of outsiders, some hateful and some actually shockingly well-meaning, believe you would be better off dead or not-you.\u00a0 I am speaking of the Deaf Community and the Gay Community.\u00a0 Another part of the analogy is that not all people who have a ticket to the community in any of these communities choose to participate.\u00a0 There are some \"Aspergians\" of a particular bent who do not want to associate themselves with other Autistics at all; there are people who choose cochlear implants and lip reading and do not use ASL at all; there are very private people or people in the closet or people not in the closet but who say \"we are not political at all\" and things like that. \n \n In all of these situations, the communities are unique in that one's parents are not automatically members along with one.\u00a0  Some parents, even of young kids, are aware of the Autistic Community and Autism Culture, and they have their counterparts in a group called PFLAG in relation to the Gay Community, I think.\u00a0 I think this is a very good position to find yourself in.\u00a0 That feeling a parent has of \"oh no, what will happen when I'm gone\" is not so bad if you can clearly picture things about your kid's life a bit.\u00a0 (I only recently know what some of these feelings are like first hand instead of just in my imagination.)\u00a0 Also, if you are a friend and ally in the Community and aware of the Culture, then your child will be able to have access to mentors and role models for life much sooner. \n \n Being cured sounds like a terrible, nightmarish, nihilistic goal for me.  \n \n Shedding the diagnosis sounds like an uncomfortable, dishonest, masochistic goal for me. \n \n Having a good life sounds best. \n \n Now that I have hopefully talked you into being even more like you already were, enhancing and magnifying the original problem, here's the part where I try to help you reframe your thinking when you hear stuff that gets your goat so it doesn't drive you up the wall.\u00a0 \n \n If you have just made the leap from \"shedding the diagnosis\" to \"having a good life\" you had to be ready to do so.\u00a0 If you have not, you were not ready.\u00a0 If you are thinking, I will never be ready, because I do not agree with that, then that is a valid position. \n \n There is a similar leap from \"being cured\" to \"shedding the diagnosis\" and some people are not ready to make it, and some will never be ready.\u00a0 Some people fly over to \"having a good life\" in a single bound, which is what I think Ariane Zurcher did... when she was ready. \n \n The main thing that I do that makes me give myself issues is where I take responsibility inside my head for making sure that everybody agrees with the things that I tell them, and if they don't, I didn't phrase it well enough, or work hard enough, or do well enough, or whatever, and I betrayed the cause or something, and a whole bunch of little kids will be called the wrong thing and have gross breakfasts even or whatever ALL BECAUSE I SUCKED.\u00a0 This is very stressful.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n When I want to stay mellow, I do my best to make the case for something I think is important and then I let go...if they want to believe the things, they will do it when they get ready.\u00a0 This happened at a meeting today, which to my joy went well--but had it gone pear-shaped, I would have been able to cope, because I was ready.\u00a0 A good side effect is that people can say more stuff in front of me without my teeth getting all hurty, because I am thinking, OK, that's where they are at right now, but I am not with that.\u00a0 We are separate.\u00a0 Long live space. \n \n And then I decide if I want to talk to them about what I am with, if I want to engage in more dialogue, or not.\u00a0 Because other people's stuff isn't really my job to worry about, once I have done my best.  \n \n This is not so easy when I am working out where I stand, myself.\u00a0 So, I do get that.\u00a0 That's a tough place.\u00a0 So if that's where I am, maybe my best is disengaged for now, not letting people yakkety-yak in my space.\u00a0 My friend has a sweatshirt that looks just like a university seal, with the university initial part being taken up with STFU.\u00a0 Heh.\u00a0  \n \n So, to make it easier on yourself, be sure to note that you stand with me.\u00a0 You know, so I don't suck and have to flip out about it.\u00a0 ;) \n \n Best, \n Ib \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jenniferhelgeson.com/gallery.html"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2012/09/language-matters.html", "title": "\nLanguage Matters\n"},

I have a question for you (well 2,\nbut they are related). I have a 3.5 year old son. He was diagnosed at 16\nmonths. He is verbal and is getting pretty good at communicating his needs. He\nloves cooking shows, being sung to, Fancy Nancy books, Sesame Street, and the\ncolor pink. We're having a couple of issues with sound now, for lack of a\nbetter way to phrase it, and I'd love your insight. \n \nThe first is that while he's getting better at letting me know when a sound is\ntoo loud for him (for example, he cried and asked for his headphones at a\nrecent party; we took him outside to have space), he is also using the phrase\n\"it hurts my ears\" whenever he doesn't get his way. He wants to\nlisten to a CD instead of the radio? \"It hurts my ears!\" Wants a\ndifferent show on TV? Gets reprimanded for breaking a rule? \"It hurts my\nears!\" Sometimes it's hard to tell whether something really IS causing him\npain (as I'm sure that party did) and what is him saying he is upset he didn't\nget his way. How can I tell the difference? How can I help him see that he\ncan't use this phrase when he doesn't get his way? Any conversation about turn-taking\nusually ends up in a meltdown, so maybe there is some sort of sensory component\nthere? I want to respect his sensory needs, but I also want to teach him how to\nbe flexible. \n \nThe second issue is around toileting. My son is doing a GREAT job of using the\ntoilet at home, at school, and at his therapy center. He'll use the toilet at\nother people's homes, too. But, he refuses to use the bathroom anywhere else\nand I know it's because of the noise. At first we thought maybe it was just\nautomatic toilets or the loud hand dryers, but I've since come to realize that\nit's the unpredictableness of using public bathrooms. Even if we put a sticker\nover the automatic toilet, someone could come in the bathroom and flush *their*\ntoilet, or use the hand dryer, or turn on the water. Do you have any\nsuggestions for how we can help him feel more comfortable? We've tried social\nstories, and stickers for the toilets, but he won't go in the bathrooms at all\nand instead prefers to \"hold it,\" which isn't that healthy (sometimes\nhe'll agree to putting on a diaper). I don't really care if he stays in a diaper\nfor awhile (learning to use the toilet can happen on his schedule, not mine),\nbut it makes me sad that this is so anxiety causing for him. \n \nThank you! \n \n~ Q \n \n \n \n Dear Q,\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Excellent and interesting questions, and I can relate to the little guy on both, so I may be able to help get in there and get at it with them.\u00a0 The way I see it now as an adult with a lot of experience in the world and theater training and all of that to help me talk about emotions and things, the actual nature of the problems might be less related than they seem to him and therefore to you.\u00a0 I'll talk a little about why I think that which will explain why I'm answering in two installments but first let me say  it is a giant credit to you that you see them as related based on the fact that he does, because that is an Awesome Parent Attribute.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Incidental information, eerily on-topic: a lot of times when groups of Autistics get together, we express applause by raising our hands and \"flapping,\" which frankly looks a lot like Jazz Hands if there was a little happy punk rock aspect added rather than the musical equivalent being smoothly jazzy (want to make sure to paint the right tonal word-picture here) or also ASL applause, higher in the air and pretty boisterous.\u00a0 We do this so those of us with sensitive ears don't have to get that ear-burst of clap-thunder, which isn't really that rewarding if it hurts. \n \n \n \n So that explains this:\u00a0 Flaps to your Attributes! Listening, trust, respect, viewing the world together with your children... \n \n \n \n Now down to business. \n \n \n \n I think the issue in the first paragraph has to do actually with internal and external communication and the second issue is totally sensory, and the answers are different on what to really do with that, so I'll talk about the first thing today and the second thing in the next installment. \n \n \n \n My sense is that rather than saying \"It hurts my ears\" to sort of get his way, the answer to the mystery is more like this: your son thinks \"It hurts my ears\" kind of means \"Woe is me, this is heinous.\"\u00a0 I mean it may not be like he completely thinks that is what it means when he is feeling great and going on full powers, but when things get egregious, emotive communication can be the first thing to go.\u00a0 Also, since he is so young, he might actually think that all different variants of life being unbearable are really sort of the same thing, that really are best expressed by \"It hurts my ears.\" \n \n \n \n In essence I think what needs to happen isn't materially that he needs to see that he can't just use that phrase to get his own way... \n \n \n \n Another hopefully useful side note.\u00a0 All of my life I have been either baffled or maddened or hilarified (I know, not a word, but it's a  thing ; you know it is) by the situation of people telling me I cannot do something I just did.\u00a0 Clearly, I just did it, meaning it is within the realm of possibility so kind of by definition I can... I now recognize that this is a \"smart remark\" which is not particularly valuable or to be desired in the real worlds or ordinary conversation but I want to share it with everyone's parents because I suspect people are accidentally telling their kids they can't do things right after they just did them and finding this tactic to be wildly unsuccessful.\u00a0 As an adult, I know that people who say \"you can't x\" are trying to express \"x is not allowed in polite society\" or \"I forbid x\" or \"do not x\" or \"x is against the rules\" or \"no dang x-ing!\" or the like.\u00a0 But I think as a youngster I was too derailed by the fact of what was actually said and how true I thought it wasn't to focus on what was meant to be expressed, pretty much ever.\u00a0 I am not making fun of anyone here who says \"can't;\" I just want you to know what there is a chance your little ones might be thinking or hearing or having happen in their heads while you are trying to talk to them. \n \n \n \n So in essence I think what actually needs to happen for him on this has two prongs.\u00a0 First, I'm not sure he really knows the difference between what is hurting his ears and what is hurting his need for order, or thirst for predictability, or feelings.\u00a0 In terms of his feelings, the details of those are even more complex and difficult to process.\u00a0 It will probably take a long time to teach him to get really good at sorting out his feelings, and expressing them.\u00a0 But he can express his needs and wants in a way that is closer to socially understandable, and this is the second prong, that I think you can see progress in quicker. \n \n \n \n Myself, I had a situation of being terrible at sorting and expressing particular emotional details which I now know is called \"alexithymia\" and can often happen to people who are otherwise verbally fluent, which sadly makes it seem like they are being withholding or ornery or some other thing.\u00a0 This used to cause great distress to people who were close to me before I learned about it.\u00a0 Now as a kid, for example, I think my theory about everything I \"couldn't do\" was \"I can't breathe\" and I think when I became unable to go to high school I tried to be more expressive about that by adding the reason \"There are no windows.\"\u00a0 Of course now I can see this is not a really accurate rendition of what was going on with me at the time, and not at all up to par with the rest of my verbal-expressive range, but that was the best I could do.\u00a0 My own detailed learning about emotional expression came later in life (twenties) but I think it's a great idea to do what you can as early as possible.\u00a0 I know my parents did what they could, though.\u00a0 It just really is a problem.\u00a0 For me, theater was extremely valuable as a learning platform. \n \n \n \n Even now, I have a verbal habit of saying things \"hurt my feelings\" now that I have learned that this is more likely to be be closer to accurate, when in reality it's sort of the complementary to what you are experiencing with your son.\u00a0 I might say, \"Mind if I switch the lighting? It's hurting my feelings.\"\u00a0 Now, wait, you're closer to right than I thought.\u00a0 I am using shorthand and getting my signals mixed because of sensory reasons messing up my emotional-expression learnedness.\u00a0 Interesting.\u00a0 Anyway, the lighting isn't hurting my feelings, not in the proper idiomatic usage, it's hurting my senses.\u00a0 But I am saying ACK.\u00a0 Probably, \"You can't x\" is really also ACK.\u00a0 People could just say ACK to each other and save time.... \n \n \n \n In the shorter term, he could learn that some other phrases cause you to notice his distress and save him from nightmare land.\u00a0 I think he will be attracted to the concepts of accuracy first and then precision more and more as he gets older.\u00a0 I suggest a good substitute to use right now is \"It's bothering me.\"\u00a0 That way, it will be true of all the bothersome things.\u00a0 I think if you hear him saying something is hurting his ears that is patently non-sonic you might consistently respond with \"x is not on/in your ears. Is it bothering you?\"\u00a0 So probably \"Time for bed.\" \"It's hurting my ears!\" \"Your bed is not in your ears.\u00a0 Is it bothering you?\"\u00a0 And if it is potentially to do with his ears, and that seems likely, you can also show him that ear-hurt is a bother, by saying \"It's hurting your ears? Is it bothering you?\" (I don't think you should say \"It's hurting your ears? Is it bothering you?\" unless the ears are a likely culprit, because when you help him focus on the things that are not actually on or in his ears for real, I think you are getting him started on sorting things out.\u00a0 Also, if you know what it is the real culprit, or you might, you could suggest that, especially to help him in conversing about it after he says yes! to the question of bother.) \n \n \n \n Two things will hopefully happen, and I think are very likely to happen.\u00a0 1. He will engage in some conversation practice about it and give you info that may lead to more introspection you can help him with; 2. He will notice that you find the concept of things bothering him to be an engaging and relevant point of discussion and will switch to \"It's bothering me\" for the default instead of \"It's hurting my ears.\"\u00a0 If he has any echolalic tendencies you can help the second one along with rhythm and repetition, as in \"It's bothering you?\" (just the way he would say it) and then he says \"It's bothering me\" and then you say with concern and Parental Magic Fixitness spicing it up but in the same rhythm \"Aw, it's bothering you\" and then hug him or sing the special song or do the thing that makes him feel Parental Magic Fixitness in his world has occurred. \n \n \n \n The only glitch about the above is that in order to make the above linguistic change stick, you kind of have to give him his own way more than otherwise for a while, when he expresses himself by being bothered instead of having his ears leading the charge of everything.\u00a0 This is temporary.\u00a0 You do not have to give him his way forever just because he says things bother him.\u00a0 I advocate for kids in my tribe, but, you know, not to that extent!\u00a0 ;) \n \n Meanwhile, I will try to help with some things to help him learn to desensitize his ears a bit for real, and ways you can do that with him since he is so young, that have worked for me.\u00a0 I can actually make my ears less sensitive if I have a heads up to do it, which is incredibly useful in life.\u00a0 And also with general desensitizing to particular sound ranges and startles and things which I'll talk about next time, knowing how to do this is super useful.\u00a0 I will also talk about using it in terms of turn-taking meltdowns, because talking about things you don't get when you are sort of done being able to hear about it  feels like  a sensory issue, it really does.\u00a0 So maybe there can be a part three about feeling sorting (note that \"feel\" is both a sensory and an emotional word, which makes me feel sort of vindicated about getting my body and emotional self mixed up all my life) but I think he is so young, and what I will really say about that now is think about theater games and look to see if there are local places he can go for that.\u00a0 So look for part two.\u00a0 Hope you liked Part One.\u00a0 Let me know how it goes! \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2012/11/it-hurts-my-ears-part-one.html", "title": "\n\"It Hurts My Ears\" Part One\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, December 29, 2012", "body": "\nYou can read in \u00a0 Loud Hands: Autistic People, Speaking \u00a0about the shall-remain-nameless professor who said in front of me and many others in graduate school that autistics did not know what it was like to be themselves because they had no theory of mind, so one had to read research about them done by others in order to understand them at all, (which presumably if you were one of them, you never could anyway--this part is logically editorialized by me). \n \nThere was another professor who said in a large class of aspiring special education and psychology researchers, \"Except for Grace, the idiot savant, who doesn't count,\" because I recalled more than seven allegedly random numbers which were not actually random, but had a clear pattern, and he hadn't told me ahead of time that the object of the exercise was to demonstrate that nobody can recall more than seven random things in short term memory. \n \nThose two professors I mostly steered clear of. \u00a0A third one, I trusted, because he seemed lovely. \u00a0He told me that facilitated communication (FC) was a dangerous non-scientific fad which co-opted people's voice and autonomy, and we, as scientist-practitioners, had to reject such nonsense, even though we should still go to TASH, where some people believed in silly things. \u00a0He acted as if he meant this nobly, and so I believed him. \u00a0But I still didn't quite feel safe enough to tell him who I was, that his colleague had hit the nail on the head with the completely inappropriate joke of \"idiot savant.\" \n \nMy graduate university is famous for its brilliant education program, which runs several of its own conferences, and from which one can get a job even in an economic downturn. \u00a0I was well-trained in several kinds of sciencey goodness by some seriously important people. \u00a0I kept my hands in my pockets all the time and made sure nobody ever came to my apartment while making a big giant show of becoming elected President of the student association to demonstrate my ever-loving sociable respectability. \n \nI spent almost all my spoons, and became quite ill in the process, but at least I learned really important scientific academic things, like how to be patriarchally condescending toward my fellow Autistics, \"protecting\" them from themselves while I secretly cowered in the migraine-inducing limelight, doing whatever I could to avoid exposing my need for shade and quiet and peace. \u00a0(I also learned really amazing actually useful things, such as see link below.) \n \nSo when you hear me now, as you will hear me now, defending people whose voices are made manifest by typing, you should know that I am not a scientific naif. \u00a0Here is what happened: I met many people who communicate by typing (as I often do myself) and found out from them what their life experiences were. \u00a0In epistemological terms, this is sometimes called phenomenological knowledge, or to put it more idiomatically, getting it from the horse's mouth. \u00a0I consider its warrant stronger than that of many of the quasi- and experimental studies that have been used to devoice those who are non-speaking, because of the question of goodness-of-fit. \u00a0In other words, I am a person who has been carefully trained to understand what various kinds of research studies are able to show and not show, and here is an excellent\u00a0 book \u00a0I was lucky enough to help edit for the top  ed research organization \u00a0about just that topic, if you are interested in delving more deeply into it for yourself. \n \nAnd it is because of this that I have changed my mind and attitudes about the breadth of communication choices of people whose way of communicating is through typing, even if they are not yet entirely independent with it. \u00a0In other words, you can tell me all about FC being 'unscientific,' but know this is something I've thought about long and deeply, and I will likely answer you in graphic detail about ethnography, phenomenology, epistemology, knowledge warrant, and patriarchalist colonialism. \u00a0I can do this for a very long time, because I was once like you are, if you are like I once was. \n \nThanks for listening. \n \nBest, \nIb \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Loud-Hands-Autistic-People-Speaking/dp/1938800028", "http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Complementary-Methods-Education-Research/dp/0805859330/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=#reader_0805859330", "http://www.aera.net/"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2012/12/i-was-self-loathing-fc-skeptic.html", "title": "\nI Was A Self-Loathing FC Skeptic\n"},

I have a severely disabled son.\nHe is nonverbal, is still in diapers, has self harming behaviors, hits himself\nin the face repeatedly and eats with his hands. I doubt he will ever progress\nto the point of living independently. I just can't imagine that ever happening\nas he's already 12 years old and only in the last year has he indicated that he\nunderstands what I mean when I ask him if he wants to go outside for some fresh\nair. I get really tired of people saying how labels are bad. I mean when anyone\nsees him they get how tough it is and they use words like severe and low\nfunctioning, and they're right to, because he is. I dont' see how that's a bad\nthing, it's an honest thing, from my perspective. Also people who seem so dead\nset against labeling are either able to write down their views (something my\nson cannot do) or they are parents of kids who are much farther along than my\nson. Truthfully I don't really care about the labels, but I do feel upset when\npeople make such a big deal about labels, when it's really clear the severe\nlabel isn't one that fits them. Also I'd like to see something that would make\nhim able to go to the bathroom and not have to wear a diaper, use a utensil to\neat his food and speak. If that's a cure, then I'll take it, if it's something\nelse, great I'll take that. But I'm sick of everyone arguing about this stuff\nwhen they can WRITE and TALK! You seem like a reasonable person.

It is something I am indeed ready to talk more about and would like to\nthink about some more. But before I do that, it is important for me to make it\nfit better with your family by knowing more pertinent details about your son,\nif you don't mind my asking. You will notice I almost always ask to know people\nbetter because I don't think what they cannot do gives me a good enough mental\npicture, enough to hold onto in my mind to feel like it is really possible for\nme to be able to talk about a person. \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \u00a0\u00a0 So your\nson, what does he love? What are some things that really seem to interest him\nor hold his attention? Another thing that I found really fascinating is that he\nrecently started indicating that he knows what you mean when you ask him if he\nwants to go outside for some fresh air. How does he indicate this? And is the\nanswer usually yes, or no? Are there other things he indicates to you? Are\nthere things he can't stand? Things you can predict he would gravitate toward?\nI would just love to hear more about him, whatever you can think of that you\ndon't mind telling me. \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then I\nwill honestly tell you my thoughts on labels.

I'll tyr to answer your questions. I'm glad you asked all these\nquestions. I dont know how many I can answer but am tyring to answer them. J\nlikes pizza, it's the only thing he'll eat. He strips the cheese off, eats that\nfirst then licks the tomato sauce off then scrapes the soft doughy part with\nhis teeth and leaves the outer crust and what's left of the underneath part of\nthe pizza. Let's see what else... Okay, I think he likes being with us, his\nfamily, me, my husband and his brother, although his brother is older by two\nand a half years (just turned 15) and they don't play or anything. J likes\nSesame street and I guess maybe Elmo. But J is really unpredictable and is\nbecoming more and more angry and violent. He hit his brother the other day in\nthe face. We're all a little scared of him, to be honest. \u2028 The\nschool called us and asked what they should do when he runs out of the\nclassroom, often screaming. He also hits himself. Did I mention that already?\nHe likes going down the slide at the playground. But mostly he wants to be\nalone or is angry and makes this kind of screaming noise. \u2028 I know\nhe likes going outside because he smiles when I ask him. He doesn't smile that\nmuch any more. He doesn't like it when we tell him he has to do anything, like\nget dressed or brush his teeth. He lets me brush his teeth but if I try to get\nhim to do it, he starts hitting. I guess I feel sad all the time and hopeless.\nI'm just going to be honest with you, because I don't see how this is a good\nlife for any human being. I mean no one would ask to be this way. No one would\n\"choose\" to be like this. I think he feels that way too. We try. We\nlove him. We wish we could do more to help him. We wish we could communicate\nbetter with him. But it's exhausting and my husband and I both have to work, so\nhe goes to this school and is in a classroom for Autistic kids. They say they\nare working on a goal of toilet training him. They've been working on that goal\nfor awhile. \u2028 Yeah. so I guess that's it. \u2028 I did read\nthat thing you wrote about your friend. It's good he has you as a friend. But\nreally, who would choose to live like that? In a group home, dependent on other\npeople? So yeah, when people ask, well how autistic is he, I say, severely,\nbecause what else am I suppose to say? I mean I'm not going to say well he's in\ndiapers and hits himself and gets violent and stuff. Like I said, if there was\na cure or a pill that he could take that let him have friends or be toilet\ntrained or eat other foods or not be so angry I'd give it to him in a heart\nbeat. I would. I don't think that make me a bad parent to want that for my son.\nI love him. I do. But I hate that he can't do so many things. I don't blame his\n\"autism\" or whatever, I don't even know what that means anymore. I\njust hate seeing him like this. Tina \u2028 \n \n \n \n Dear Tina,\u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n \u2028There's more than one thing going on here.\n\u00a0The first thing you asked about was labels like \"severe\" and\n\"low-functioning,\" but then I think you were asking about other\nthings like teaching, how to help him, and touching on feelings of hopelessness\nwhich are understandable especially since you are working so hard and he is\nsmiling less now and acting more aggressive and unhappy than he was before.\n\u00a0But he just recently started letting you know he was happy about going\noutside with you, so there is light...\u2028 \n \n \n \n \u2028One of the first things that just jumps off the\npage at me is that throughout all the pain and confusion and desperation (and\nmaybe even depression, though I am not a clinician, but a lot of people have\ndepression these days and they screen you for free and when you have clinical\ndepression and you get help for it that is one piece of extra weight that can\nbe lifted off your shoulders, if that is you, which again I don't know, but it\ncould be, and it might not be such a bad idea to check, just in case, why not?)\nyou are a woman who loves her child very, very deeply.\u2028 \u00a0Love is the\nrealest thing and it can be real in any kind of unreality or harshness or\nwhatever. \u00a0Love holds. \n \n \n \n \u2028The weight of the world is crushing you like flat\nright now, I can hear that in your voice too--but your love for your child\nleaps off the page in 3D relief. \u00a0That is an uncrushable thing,\ninvincible. \u00a0It will keep you strong forever even if you don't know it.\n\u00a0Harry Potter's mom doesn't really die, I really think she doesn't, and\ncan Harry Potter be destroyed? No, not in any way. Why? His mother's love.\u2028 \n \n \n \n \u2028I want to talk about teaching before I talk about\nlabels because although labels are super important and a great thing to talk\nabout, and I am so glad you asked about them, the fact that teaching is not the\nsame thing as curing, which is this fakey kind of lure they hold out to\ntantalize people, and that teaching really exists, and better teaching can\nhappen--I think this might be a thing that will be a thing that I want to tell\nyou sooner because of the weight on your shoulders. \u00a0You don't have to\nwait for the \"cure\" (which is sadly likely to be more like prevention\nwith the way they seem to be looking at things, and hence completely unlikely\nto be of any help to your family or anybody's family at all unless the\nprevention of families is considered helpful) for things to become easier and\nbetter in day to day situations.\u2028 \n \n \n \n \u2028 J's teachers are, under the law, doing something\ncalled FBA-BIPs which mean Functional Behavior Analysis/Behavior Intervention\nPlans. \u00a0If they are not, they need to be, because he is hurting himself\nand scaring you. \u00a0If they are, they may need some help doing them well, because\nthey are not working well right now.\u2028 \u00a0(Note to other people: If you are a\nperson who has to write FBA-BIPs and there is nobody to help you, you can also\nwrite in to the question box and I will welcome you with open arms.\n\u00a0Either I will find you help in your area or I will help you, but make\nsure I have a lot of lead time on your deadlines because chances are I will not\nhave a fast turnaround and also the data collection I advise will also not be\nthat fast.) \n \n \n \n \u2028When someone has trouble communicating well, he or\nshe is likely to \"act out\" the message--like in charades.\n\u00a0Imagine you have walked into town to get a can of petrol or gasoline in a\ncountry whose language you don't speak while your husband waits at the side of\nthe road with the broken down car. \u00a0You suddenly notice they don't use gas\npumps there. \u00a0WTF? \u00a0How are you going to get this across, what\ncharade can you even do? \u00a0You begin to panic--wait, all you have is two US\ndollars.... Now imagine this is your whole life. \u00a0A good analysis of the\nfunction (or, as I prefer \"meaning\") of a \"behavior\" works\nto get to a translation of what the person would rather be saying instead of\ndoing that, if only he or she could. \u00a0Another way of thinking about this\nthat helps some people is, what would it take for me to do that? A good\nbehavior analyst doing a FBA seriously needs to ask the kid's mother as part of\nthe data collection consideration array, because who can interpret better?\u2028 \n \n \n \n \u2028So here is what it should look like: There are a\nlist of things that are really important that would make J's life much better\nif the world knew what J was trying to say when he does that. \u00a0The teacher\nor consultant who is doing the FBA (with your help, or asking you to also do\none) is marking down times when these things happen, with details, to get a\nfeeling for all the surrounding events before, during, after. \u00a0A pattern\nshould emerge, so everyone really knows what might contribute to making the\n\"statement\" occur. \u00a0\u2028 \n \n \n \n \u2028The BIP is the part where it is called a Behavior\nIntervention Plan. \u00a0Traditionally, this can be a token economy (bribery)\netc., but shockingly, this doesn't always work the best with Autistics because\nthey might not get the point. \u00a0What does work is getting them to buy into it\nfor real so that they get the point and are on your team because they get that\nyou are on their team. \u00a0They see that their life will suck less when they\nhave a better way of being understood, because you have helped design one, and\nlo and behold! It actually does work a lot better. \u00a0So say like the FBA\nshows a pattern that J gets aggressive and loudly hits himself when he needs a\nbreak from people getting in his face making demands. \u00a0The new way he can\nlearn, as an example, but this is one I teach a lot of, is to make the\n\"hands up\" gesture between his shoulders and ears that almost\neveryone can read as \"Hey, man, can you please back off for a sec?\"\nand when he sees how everyone backs up for a sec instead of having a giant\npanic attack he will notice that the gesture is a better lifestyle than the\naggression, because the aggression really seriously just causes a bunch more\nnoise whereas the gesture makes people step off, so hence it is truly a better\nsolution to the \"people in your face\" issue. \u00a0Does that make\nsense? \u00a0It is really, honestly a real improvement in his real life.\n\u00a0He can learn it because there is a point to it. \u00a0If everything on\nhis FBA/BIP has this feature I am seriously serious that it will have more of a\nsuccess rate because he will see the reason and have a purpose for being\nmotivated. \u00a0This is slightly different from traditional behaviorism\nbecause it takes his agency as a human with wishes and desires into account,\nrather than thinking of him mechanistically as like a behavior-machine, so you may\nhave to explain it to the people working with him at some length, or print this\nand take it to them, just so they see that one secret twist that may have\ndiffered from their training and education that makes the whole thing work\nbetter (and by the way it also makes it more morally decent, but that is\nanother story).\u2028 \n \n \n \n Also from liking to be outside and running and\ngoing down the slide, he might love the feeling of wind on his ears. \u00a0I\nlove this feeling. \u00a0He might love it if he is on the front of a ferry or\nriding a bike or running track or in the car with the window open. \u00a0If he\ngets a lot of this feeling in life he might smile a lot, especially if he knows\na way to get it on purpose other than running screaming from the room (which I\ndo not know if that is why he does that... it might be the people in your face\nissue... you can tell when you track when and where he does it... it might be\nboth). \u00a0People do learn to communicate more and more in ways that work\nbetter when they find out it works better. \u00a0Nothing succeeds like success. \n \n \n \n I think there might be a positive feedback loop\nsituation when he learns some better forms of communicating at school and then\nhence also you yourself get happier and less stressed. \u00a0In my imagination\nbecause you love him so much he is probably also aware of your mood and wishes\nyou felt better but doesn't know how to communicate that. \u00a0This is not\nlike me trying to blame you for how you feel but just to let you know that J\ncares about you and when he sees you getting happier if he puts 2 and 2\ntogether with that he will also get happier and that will just be another\nmotivator for him. \u00a0I think he loves it when you brush his teeth because\nthat is you touching him and he just loves being near you. Maybe if you put his\ntoothbrush there on the sink and brush your own teeth there too and he can copy\nyou parallel in quiet he might like that, like a ritual you can do together.\n\u00a0Could be worth a try. \n \n \n \n Think about J's smile and think about how totally\nreal and happy it is and pure, when he is happy. \u00a0I don't think he is\ngoing around thinking about being dependent that much, just guessing,\nespecially not on you, because that is just him being with you. Speaking of the\nconcept of independence, and how it is a concept that not everyone has that much\nof a priority about, I want to talk about Eric, so. \n \n \n \n Let me talk about Eric for a minute and then get to\nlabels in general. \u00a0I knew Eric when I was in grad school and at the time\nI considered him to be happier than me because he was laid back and doing his\nthing whereas I was trying to negotiate all these situations where I did not\nfit in and had no idea how to act. \u00a0In a lot of ways I was bugging out and\nthat is why I went to see him so often because his happy mellow beach dude\nenergy was extremely relaxing. \u00a0Then I got into this living situation\nwhere I did not have my own transportation and could not visit him whenever I\nwanted and I was seriously ultra bugging out, and it was a nightmare and my\nanxiety increased a lot. \u00a0There were no situations where I could just\nseriously just BE and know that the person I was being with would completely\nunderstand the concept of doing that, of doing, well, nothing. \u00a0I do have\na friend like that in Seattle but Eric was it in my grad school. \u00a0There's\ntrade offs like he has these noisy roommates whatever but the state pays his\nrent and he lives AT THE BEACH I mean he is this beach guy with a pretend job\nand the economy allows him to live at the beach in Southern California, and he\njust walks away from his roommates, because it really never rains there, so why\nbe inside? \u00a0Yeah Eric knows what he's doing, he chooses. \n \n \n \n Which brings me to labels. \u00a0The reason I am\nnot in love with them is because they are so context-driven. \u00a0Eric is\nprobably considered \"low-functioning\" because he has a fake job and\nlives in a group home and hardly talks and can't write but during that time\nperiod when I lost touch with him I had, because of my\n\"high-functioning\" lifestyle, an anxiety attack so bad I thought it\nwas a cardiac issue and was admitted to ER because my blood pressure got so\nhigh (my resting blood pressure is on the low side). \u00a0Everything was\nbecoming absolutely terrifying. \u00a0Slightly later, I was in horrific pain\nbecause I needed surgery, but I did not realize that the pain indicated a need\nfor surgery. \u00a0It was just something I didn't like. \u00a0This lasted for\nsome time. \u00a0At some point my mother noticed on the phone that there was\nsomething wrong with me and told me to come home so she could check out what\nwas going on. \u00a0I did, and apparently it turned out to be a\nlife-threatening situation that was also apparently kind of obvious, but again,\nwith my time agnosia and various \"spacey\" aspects, I overlooked the\ndanger. \u00a0Fortunately, my mother was there to get it taken care of, and I\nlived. \u00a0Long live Moms. \u00a0:) \n \n \n \n So now by the grace of God I am happily married and\nhence if I were to need life-saving surgery, my wife, who is a nurse, as is my\nmother, would notice this detail. \u00a0They sort of gang up on me. \u00a0:D.\n\u00a0So, but also, if Eric and I were on the beach itself instead of on the\ncliff, and high tide were rolling in, and we were on the wrong type of sand\nbar, he was the one who had it together to know that, not me. \u00a0No matter\nhow much of a professor I am now and he lives in a group home and I am writing\nand he is probably thinking about the waves and smiling for no apparent reason,\neven though there is a reason, since he is thinking about the waves, which are\nsmile-worthy, he is the one that has it together to know how not to drown, not\nme. \u00a0So that is kind of what I am talking about, about context. \u00a0I\ncould be drowning, and Eric could be saving my life. \u00a0Is he\nlow-functioning and I'm high-functioning then? \u00a0Just because when me and\nhim both smile for \"no reason\" I am the one who can answer you when\nyou ask me why? \n \n \n \n But I understand that you need a thing to say.\n\u00a0I get that there is some kind of difference, and also that it is\nimportant to be able to talk to people, and not have it take seventeen hours of\nTMI. \u00a0That is logical and I do know what you mean. \u00a0Also I get that I\nfeel a real kinship with Eric, if you saw us together, we wouldn't seem that\ndifferent, and if I could meet your son we would probably be able to relate at\nsome type of interesting level. \u00a0You would be like, huh. \u00a0I am not\nsure why this is, but it has been happening for years. \u00a0First I want to\nsuggest a thing to say and then why I like it and then why I don't like the\nothers and then talk about Pascal's Wager as a reason to be careful and use the\nthing I like which is value-neutral. \n \n \n \n Here is the thing I like, which is value neutral.\n\u00a0I got it from Shannon Des Roches Rosa, who wrote it about her son: she\nsaid he has \"high-octane autism.\" \u00a0That just really appealed to\nme because you get the point that it is a big deal, but it doesn't sound like\nsuch a bad thing. \u00a0It kind of sounds, you know, race-car-ish. \u00a0In\nfact, it might even be a little on the awesome side, if her son were to\noverhear. \u00a0(Hi Shannon Des Roches Rosa, I hope you see this! \u00a0I don't\nthink I can tag you but I wish I could! \u00a0I am writing that I love your\nword!) \u00a0On the other hand, it's not like other listeners wouldn't get the\npoint, you get the point, high-octane. \u00a0Not wimpy. \u00a0Serious. \n \n \n \n So apart from the \"severe\" and\n\"low\" and \"high\" labels being inaccurate sometimes because\nthey change during context changes, I also don't love that they reduce people\nto \"functioning\" like a human is a human doing rather than a human\nbeing. \u00a0We are meant to BE. \u00a0That is what makes us worthy, not high\nor low. \u00a0But the A Number One thing I dislike is that people might\noverhear and feel heinous about themselves. \u00a0This has happened to a lot of\npeople I know, and it is just not worth it. \n \n \n \n Sometimes it seems like No Way Can He Hear And\nUnderstand Anything. \u00a0Or maybe you didn't think that but some doctor or\nspeech pathologist or psychologist or psychiatrist told it to you for an\nalleged fact, and you were like, well, guess they are the Expert. \u00a0But I\ndon't think the risk is worth it. \n \n \n \n So my way of thinking about this is based on an\nidea made up by philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal called\u00a0 Pascal's\nWager \u00a0to see if it would be a good idea to believe in God.\n\u00a0You can see in the article if you click on it (it's a good one) that the\nidea is controversial, but it is still useful as a framework. \u00a0Basically\nit is that you picture all four scenarios, and here it is filled out for\npositive and negative language and the kid understanding you or not, with the\noutcomes:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n To me (and also to Pascal, which was his argument\non why we should believe in God) even though the two situations on the far\nright have nothing happening, and that's 50% of the likelihood, it's just not\nworth it to go there because the lower left is so much worse than the upper\nleft that you are kind of forced by reason to choose to believe (or at least\nkind of act like you believe, or hope anyway) in the conditions of the upper\nleft, being \"Kid understands words\" mixed with \"You say Positive\nstuff.\" \u00a0Remember, many people who can write did not learn how to\nwrite until later in life and to this day are what I am going to call High\nOctane :) \n \n \n \n Does that make sense or help at all? \u00a0Now to me,\nI think High Octane is the perfect solution because it totally sounds positive\nto me or a kid, nothing wrong with it, my awesome car takes High Octane, but at\nthe same time, the listener can totally tell you are not talking about some\nwimpy situation of a nerdy professor such as the writer of this blog, even\nthough the writer of this blog may drown or get hit by a car or not understand\nthe need for surgery or whatever it may be ;). \n \n \n \n Tina, thanks for your patience. \u00a0I hope I was\nable to help on the FBA/BIP stuff. \u00a0It should really work fast if you run\nit by the teachers, the violent running yelling hitting stuff should get toned\nway down when he is understood, especially if you help them. \u00a0The\ntoileting is different and I will need to look into that some more because\nmaking that matter to someone when it doesn't yet is a whole new kettle of fish\nso I want to open that up to other folks who may have had success, and also I\nwill ask around. \u00a0Anyone?

Hang in there, stick around; I have some\nwonderful people to introduce you to. \u00a0\n Parents like yourselves, the kind I\u2019ve observed (from the honest and\nsensitive questions and comments) who read this particular blog. \n \n \n \nBecause check it out. \u00a0\n All those wonderful, loving, open people in Georgia? \u00a0  That was just in Georgia. \u00a0  And only in one part of Georgia. \u00a0  It\u2019s a big, wide world, full of love\nand compassion and sparkles on the water and dapples in the trees. \n \nLove, \nIb \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZOMP4s09iRk/UWSaEAz1KUI/AAAAAAAAADk/8TUjDkgPLW0/s1600/HirschBird_RGB_Red_sm.jpg", "http://tash.org/call-for-proposals-is-now-open/"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2013/04/open-heartedness.html", "title": "\nOpen-Heartedness\n"},

This was commissioned as a general tip sheet for an organization, but I also want to reprint it to here in case it will be of use to any of my readers.\u00a0 It is about the transition of leaving school, and is a bit US-centric in parts.\u00a0 Sorry about that; after I finish converging ideas for Dealing With Family Matters, I'll write an article about transition in general, not centered so much on US law. \n \n \n \n Transitions of any kind are difficult for most people, and\nthey\u2019re even more of a challenge for Autistic people and teenagers, and now you\nare helping your Autistic teenager face Transition with a capital T. \u00a0  This is the big one, and it is complex. \n \n \n \nSchool Transition Services \n \nStarting from the age of 14, transition planning must start\nin schools, by law. \u00a0  Note that in\nsome states, it must actually be implemented at this time, whereas in other\nstates the schools have until age 16 to implement the planning that began at\n14. \u00a0  Unfortunately, schools do not\nalways seem to be aware of this, and it can be left to parents to keep\ntrack. \u00a0  (An Autistic person who is\nalso a Special Education Professor and family advocate and has sadly seen this\nall too often is writing this tip sheet.) \u00a0\n So: the first thing to do is make sure the school is on top of the\nsituation at the correct age. \n \n \n \nPost-School Services \n \nOne of the things that are of paramount importance is to\nfind out how, in your area, services are obtained once school is over. \u00a0  In all likelihood there is a gigantic\nwaiting list and a byzantine system. \u00a0\n Learn the system early and often; sign up for the waiting lists right\nnow. \n \n \n \nNow, What Are Some Specifics To Think About? \u00a0  For living: \n \n \u00a7 \u00a0\n Where to live \n \n \u00a7 \u00a0\n Skills for living (practical) \n \n o \u00a0\u00a0  Self-advocacy\nskills \n \n o \u00a0\u00a0  Cooking \n \n o \u00a0\u00a0

\n o \u00a0\u00a0  Communication\nusing voice, sign, PECS or AAC as necessary \n \n o \u00a0\u00a0  Coping\nwith potential noise pollution or aromatic overload, etc. \n \n o \u00a0\u00a0

\u00a7 \u00a0\n Where to work or go to college \n \n \u00a7 \u00a0\n How to get a job or get into college \n \n \u00a7 \u00a0\n Supported employment/job coaching/training/other\nwork/community

AAC as necessary \n \n o \u00a0\u00a0  Learning\nwhere/how to access the hidden curriculum of a workplace or campus \n \n o \u00a0\u00a0  Feeling\nconfident choosing contexts for various activities \n \n o \u00a0\u00a0  Ability\nto recognize and regulate needs \n \n o \u00a0\u00a0  Keeping\nsafe \n \n o \u00a0\u00a0  Etc. \n \n \n \nThese are just a few of the things to keep in mind for transition\nplanning in the formal sense, to get you started. \u00a0  It\u2019s not exhaustive and it\u2019s also not mandatory. \u00a0  Plenty of people don\u2019t choose to do all\nor any of these things for cultural, personal or other reasons. \u00a0  There are\nalso informal aspects and arrangements to consider.  \n \n \n \nIn one example, because the employment prospects were so\nunpromising and the wait-list for services so long and also unpromising, a\nfather known to this writer positioned himself on his beautiful historic town\u2019s\nChamber of Commerce, giving himself ample time to make the connections needed\nto make sure his son had a well-fitting job opportunity despite being a person\nwho does not necessarily adore job interviews or such like. \u00a0  As you know, parents do what they must. \n \n \n \nYou also know that a lot of what you will be helping with in\ntransition is the emotional and sensory turmoil that comes along with changes,\nand these changes are all big and important ones. \u00a0  You may be feeling shaky yourself now, because this is not\nthe easiest of times, but rest assured: you do not need a tip sheet to know how\nto be there to support your teenager as only a parent can. \u00a0  You know how to listen and to love\nunconditionally, and that is the most important thing. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links":

You don\u2019t have to worry about people finding out because you are in control of them finding out \n \n2. You get a chance to educate people about things you need, or\nabout Autism in general, instead of listening to people just make assumptions\nall day \n \n3. You can access legal protections (you can get these by\ndisclosing only to the HR office, or the appropriate authorities; you don\u2019t\nhave to tell everyone) \n \n4. It is easier for others in the community online and in real life to find you and\nmake friends \n \n5. You can feel a sense of pride in who you are, and hold your\nhead up high, and not hide \n \n6. You can march in parades and join solidarity groups like ASAN,\nwhich gives you more power in life! \n \n \n \nSix Not So Good Things About Disclosing \n \n1. Some ignorant people will suddenly act like you are automatically\nincompetent and talk down to you \n \n2. These same types of people might decide to leave you out of\nthings if they are not already doing that \n \n3. Other people might be afraid to approach you or ask you\nquestions because they are nice but they don\u2019t know what Autism is and they are\nscared of new information \n \n4. Some people believe false beliefs about Autism, and they\nmight apply these to you \n \n5. Explaining about things too much can make you kind of tired \n6. Other well meaning people who are nice but don't understand might make you do more things because they need a token disabled person, which\nalso makes you tired \n \n \n \nYou might notice that the good things and the not so good\nthings are sort of equal in weight, so they don\u2019t automatically make the\ndecision easy. \u00a0  This is where the\ncontext and people come in, but people are hard to predict. \n \n \n \n So to figure this out, you really have to think about\nyourself. \u00a0  Here is a grid about what\nyou might think when you read the above lists that can help you decide. \u00a0 Y ou can use it to read the Pro and Con list\nagain, and see which reaction matches yours the most. \u00a0  Then, see if the answer that the grid gives you feels good.  \u00a0 Remember, there\u2019s no right or wrong,\nthere\u2019s only your choice of what is comfortable. \u00a0  \u00a0Also remember you don't have to tell everyone there is: you can make this choice in stages. And you don't have to tell anyone. \u00a0It's up to you to do what you want because you are you and you are the one who chooses. \u00a0When I finally told the world, I was very glad I did, though, just to let you know one person's experience. \u00a0You can sort of tell because of who I am on the rest of this blog that the positives outweigh the negatives, for me. \u00a0Best of luck to you on your own journey! \n \n \n \n***Note from Ib: This blog post and the next are general questions asked of me in general and answered more widely. \u00a0I am working on the answer to \"Dealing With Family Matters\" who has a very delicate and important personal question that has been in the hopper and it's taking me a while to actually work it out. \u00a0DWFM... I am asking for a lot of family advice and also input from wise people I know on your dilemma and I hope I can help! \n \n \n \n\n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YJTA80eivD0/UXa5Ku-1rfI/AAAAAAAAAD4/4CDOmZvxWQo/s1600/DisclosureChart.tiff"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2013/04/im-autistic-should-i-self-disclose.html", "title": "\nI\u2019m Autistic.

{"date": "Wednesday, June 12, 2013", "body": "\nThere have been a great many questions coming in during the past few weeks about wandering or eloping or the various things people call it, so many that it was hard to pick a particular one to answer, because of the different nuances. \n \nSome of the questions were about my \"position\" on it, and some were about my experiences, and some were about whether I could help. \n \nI have read the things that brought up some of these questions. \n \nMy heart goes out to the families of the children who wandered into danger and are lost to us now. You are all in my prayers. I have something very practical in terms of help and assistance to offer for families in similar setting situations, which is why the title asks you to spread the word.\u00a0 Soon I will post this brochure and contact information. \n \nFor those who wanted to know my experiences and maybe thus what I think about the idea of the \"wandering diagnosis\" controversy, I'll answer this a little, because the good news at this side of the story is that I totally \"get\" danger now at age 43 whereas looking back I was one of the white-knuckle-conducive kids that didn't have the foggiest clue about it before (sorry Mom). So, happy ending. I did wander around the water especially and there were these bridge access ladder things that, looking back, you are obviously not supposed to climb on, but of course I had to be there. The difficulty of getting on there could have been a clue, but, you know, no, because it was that much more compelling to get the perfect view of the dappling on the water.\u00a0 I also hung around train yards and so forth. \n \nMy thinking at the time as far as I can remember, and I have been thinking about this for a couple of weeks so I could report it properly, was sometimes more like, \"Whoa, cool,\" as in a towards-wander, and sometimes, \"Gotta-go-now\" as in an away-wander, and sometimes it was wandery, but sometimes kind of zippy, like even thinking it was zippy, and even to the point of panicky.\u00a0 I have the zippy thoughts now, but I do not do them, and this next paragraph is why. \n \nIn the away-wandering, I actually stopped doing that rather recently maybe early in this Millennium because I found out how much it hurt people's feelings. It was not easy to stop it. \n \nIn the towards-wandering, again, I have a concept of danger now.\u00a0 I do not recall when I developed this but I no longer think it is an attractive idea to do whatever without thinking about it. There is another faculty that kicks in, another thought voice, that's like, you know, you're going into the street, might want to look for cars not to drive on your foot or your body. I don't know why this started. \n \nA third wandering thing, a slower one, which is slow and in NO way do I mean it to put any onus of \"blame\" on any family or friends but since this one is not gone and still happens, I have to explain it too.\u00a0 Also I pledge right here and now to work on it.\u00a0 This is probably the classic, non-zippy wander, and it is neither to nor fro.\u00a0 It's this.\u00a0 Because all my life I have been someone that people think of as having the potential for kind of wandering off, I think I get the subliminal impression that people will follow me, like I secretly think I am the leader of the going of places. Somewhere in me is a belief or a trust that people will psychically find me or they will have followed me in the first place, because that is mostly true.\u00a0 Again, Mom, I am totally sorry.\u00a0 When I look back on my audiovisual memory files, especially of that day in the book store, how white with panic you looked... I really am sorry. \n \nSo to make a long story short, for me myself I am not thinking much when I go off somewhere, but the truancy from high school was more sort of an emergency, a communication like Landon was mentioning, and I couldn't talk about it because even though I am talkative, it is a new feature of me to be outgoing or really even let's say (to be charitable) coherent about emotions. So luckily, my folks thought of that at that time, because I guess it had a different flavor? I don't know. They are kind of psychic? \n \nAnd remember this: I hardly ever do it any more, and I'm going to do it even less. \n \nI forgot to say this: Sometimes when I was a youth and I got lost I did not like it once it dawned on me I did not really know my way back at all.\u00a0 Like, really didn't like it. More panic. Not as if I thought it was dangerous in any reasoning-about-actual-things sort of way, but as if when I newly noticed myself to be not where I normally was, it suddenly became an issue of drastic proportions and felt life-threatening for some reason when prior to that it had been just fine with me. \n \nNow.\u00a0 This brings me to this. \n \nSome people don't talk, and they are really young, or they are in other situations where they do not have a grasp of dangerousness right now, and the concept of them going out by themselves is really stressful for everyone because they could really get hurt, or dead; and it is a constant glass-in-the-guts worry for people who love them and want them safe.\u00a0 This is also true of some people with Alzheimer's and Down syndrome, by the way, as it does not just happen with Autism. \n \nWhere I live, luckily I am on the Mayor's Advisory Commission on Disabilities which gave me a chance to ask Marita Manning, Certified ADA Coordinator, how they handle that here.\u00a0 It turns out there's a wonderful grant they got here in Naperville for a thing called Fastrack where NOBODY on it since they started has been lost for even half an hour!\u00a0 I think that's kind of awesome.\u00a0 She is the one who trains with a special team of selected Police how to work with the tech as first responders in a rescue so they don't alarm the person and they would also be able to notice if something else was wrong.\u00a0 So the people are found within thirty minutes AND treated kindly and gently by specially trained officers. \n \n \n \n Marita Manning, the Certified ADA Coordinator for Naperville, IL, is the\n contact person training and liaising with our Police on this life-saving program. She is delighted to have \nme spread the word on this blog and have anyone get in touch with her so\n she can explain how to get this in your location.\u00a0 Marita Manning can \nbe reached at E-mail: manningm@naperville.il.us Tel:  (630) 420-6725  \nCell:  (630) 421-0260  TDD:  (630) 305-5205 \n \n \n \n[Image: a brochure, scanned. Update written in the cold winter maybe six months later: when I wrote \nthis in the past summer, I did not know that screen readers could not \nread the words in a scanned document. There are a lot of words in the \ndocument, the most salient among them being the information that in this\n program, the first responder team is a volunteer team of specially \ntrained ones who get to know the people ahead of time and are familiar \nwith communication styles and the whole family dynamic, and they say \n\"locating people is only half the mission\" and that they emphasize \nrelationships before the need for a rescue may arise. I think this is \npivotal and wanted to make that information accessible because I am \nsorry that it might take me a while to find this document again and type\n out the words inside which I will then put as a PS at the end of this \npost as soon as I can. Thank you for your patience.] \n \nSo to make a long story shorter, I have scanned in the inside of the brochure about it here as it works in our town, but Marita told me to spread all her contact info all round the place so that people can get this program into their own towns and special teams of Police can be trained in this way.  \n \nWith the technology we have now, people who wander away can be found very, very soon, and with the knowledge we have now, they can be found by Police who know how to show the kindness they feel in their hearts toward people who are innocent and in peril.\u00a0 Just look at the way the brochure is written and give Marita a call or e-mail to get that in your location.\u00a0 We can stop this danger together. \n \nEveryone please contact Marita so much that Fastrack is available EVERYWHERE and Marita, who is totally kind, is moved to yell at me from being contacted too much.\u00a0 That's how much contact I hope she gets from this blog being re-blogged.\u00a0 Hehe.\u00a0 Laughing but serious.\u00a0 She's got a grant for this and she can tell your town how to get more grant money, too.\u00a0 She's brilliant. \n \nFastrack saves lives all the time. \n \nOnce again with the contact info: \n \nMarita Manning, Certified ADA Coordinator for Naperville, IL, can \nbe reached at E-mail: manningm@naperville.il.us Tel:  (630) 420-6725  \nCell:  (630) 421-0260  TDD:  (630) 305-5205 \n \nThank you for listening. \n \nLove, \nIb \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Jo2HGhwqyhQ/UbjP8GNCduI/AAAAAAAAAJg/Ehs20hpYPRU/s1600/Untitled.tiff", "tel:(630)%20420-6725", "tel:(630)%20421-0260", "tel:(630)%20305-5205", "tel:(630)%20420-6725", "tel:(630)%20421-0260", "tel:(630)%20305-5205"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2013/06/wandering-please-read-and-spread-widely.html", "title": "\nWandering.

communion, is about hanging\nout together.\u00a0 He's not much of a talker at all, maybe ten words? and not\na writer.\u00a0 (And even if he were a talker, I am heinous on the phone.)\u00a0\nNext time I am in his town, and we see each other, it will still be easy to\nhang out with each other as if we just left off, because we both love to sit in\nour sea cliff hangout hidden by sea grass and watch the ocean.\u00a0 We like to\ndo this quietly. \n \n \n \n Eric is on the ball and understands what people are\nsaying and doing.\u00a0 I and some others find this obvious, but not everybody\ndoes.\u00a0 For one thing, he knows your name if he likes you, and if he doesn't,\nhe will seem never to have met you, over and over.\u00a0 If you are a loud\nface-talker who says things like Look At My Eyes, he will never openly know\nyour name.\u00a0 If you touch him without his permission, which a shocking\nnumber of people feel free to do, he won't even look at your mouth out of the\ncorner of his eyes ever again.\u00a0 Your name is mud to him, but if someone he\nlikes asks whether you, the toucher-without-permission, are a complete\njackwagon, he will very slightly smirk instead of raging, and it is really,\nreally funny and awesome how quickly he can contain himself. \n \n \n \n If he likes you, he will know your name, and say\nit, even after years.\u00a0 He says it like you are a really amazing thing,\nsince it is one of the few things he feels like saying.\u00a0 He can tell who\nyou are by that quick glance at your mouth out of the corner of his eye.\u00a0\nHe will also say yes or no, if he feels like it, but he'd rather say yes he\nwants to go to the beach by action, or invite you by getting going but leading\nwith his head and stopping after a couple steps to make sure you get the hint\nof what is happening.\u00a0 I know this because after two years of not seeing\nhim I ran into him in the grocery store where he called my name before I saw\nhim and we both dropped whatever our other plans were at his silent but clear\nand familiar suggestion and went to our spot in the bluffs. \n \n \n \n When we are together there is no yimmer yammer.\u00a0\nIt is relaxing.\u00a0 I know I can go to him to get centered and real. \u00a0  Eric knows I am also not going to stop\nhim in the middle of whatever he is doing because my agenda is more important\nor something, and then he will have to stop right there, walk backwards, and\nstart all over again.\u00a0 This is the kind of thing people do whose names he\ndoes not decide to say.\u00a0 They do it a lot.\u00a0 Many people act like they\ndon't think he understands anything, which seems odd to me.\u00a0 But now that\nI am online I see that a preponderance of people seem to believe that if you\ndon't talk, you can't listen.\u00a0 Not the truth, but widely held. \n \n \n \n I don't know how much Eric would or could talk if\nhe thought talking were a worthwhile pastime, because that would be me yakking\nasking him a ton of stuff, which he would obviously find annoying and noisy.\u00a0\nHe maybe doesn't have it to self-advocate all the time in the large ways, like\na job, but I know he has done it some, or made some of what is important to him\nknown.\u00a0 Where he lives, for example, there really isn't a good job\nsituation for people with disabilities, or even for people without, because,\nI'll just say it, he lives in California.\u00a0 We have all heard about\nCalifornia's financial woes.\u00a0 Last I knew, he spent his days in this thing\ncalled a \"day center\" which is really kind of silly.\u00a0 But he\ndoes whatever they do there, comes home, goes to the beach.\u00a0 The group\nhome where he lives has some people in it that are on the noisier side, not his\nfavorite, but he lives within walking distance of the ocean in a place where\nthe property values are really pretty out of control and it's a surprise that\nthey even have group homes there. \n \n \n \n If I still lived where Eric lives I could easily\nhelp figure out what kinds of jobs he would be good at and enjoy, not for hours\nand hours, because working too much would probably stress him out.\u00a0 Plus\nthe whole people in his face making noise thing, and interrupting his processes:\nadded stress.\u00a0 And if he wanted to, Eric could easily steal from me, or\nfake me out, or confuse me emotionally because I trust him so much, but I know\nhe is not that kind of person, and I know for certain my trust is not\nmisplaced. \u00a0  The reason I know all\nof these things and more is because we are friends and he can communicate by\nbeing himself instead of just by talking or writing.\u00a0 And I can listen by\nbeing with him and noticing who he is instead of by saying use your words and\nlook in my eyes and press the picture pecs or whatever, and so can everyone\nelse, but they just don't know how important that is, yet, probably because\nthey can't relate to him or something.\u00a0 I don't know.\u00a0 But this \u201chigh\u201d\nand \u201clow\u201d Functioning talk that keeps happening all over the place over and\nover again which is supposed to separate us somehow is hurting my eyes and ears\nand feelings and so I have to write this. \n \n \n \n Let me just put this out there: my world would be a\nwhole lot quieter if I could get away with it.\u00a0 But it isn't, and I can't,\nbecause I will yimmer yammer til the cows come home as long as it isn't Eric's\npath to tell you that Eric is a person whose life is worth living.\u00a0 It's\nhis friends' path, and he has other friends, and I am the one talking and\nwriting now, because I can, which does NOT make me better than him or more of a\nperson.\u00a0 It just gives me a slightly greater hope of being heard: Eric's\nlife is worth living.\u00a0 And not only for Eric, but for a lot of other\npeople, such as his friends, and people in the neighborhood who like seeing him\ngo by. \n \n \n \n A person is not a function.\u00a0 A person is a\nperson. \n \n\n Thank you for listening. \n Best, \n Ib \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link":

{"date": "Thursday, May 9, 2013", "body": "\n \nThis may not be anywhere approaching a verbally speaking\nAutistic universal, but I have indeed met many others with this feature, and it\nis fresh in my mind because of last night.\u00a0 (This was going to be about one topic but the topic led to other asides, so I added the other topics to the title in parentheses.) \n \n \n \nSometimes, although I think I seem to speak fairly fluently, I call\nmyself \u201cyou.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \nThis is different from the idiomatic use of \u201cyou\u201d as in\n\u201cy\u2019all\u201d or \u201cone\u201d to indicate a belief that I have access to everyone else\u2019s\nfeelings or experience. \u00a0  It is an\naccidental usage that happens when I am tired or nervous or upset and it causes\nme to make statements I do not agree with, straight up. \n \n \n \nLast night, on the radio, which turned out to be a lot of\nfun (but I was shockingly nervous about it) I am pretty sure I said something\nlike this: \u201cYou need the right partner [to be able to raise kids].\u201d \u00a0  This is not something I actually\nbelieve, at all, especially since I know that Paula, who was there, is a\nfabulously successful single mother, just for one example. \u00a0  What I do know and believe is that  I  need the right partner, and would not\nhave undertaken to have children prior to meeting my Layenie. \u00a0  Additionally, the question was about\nme, not \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cy\u2019all,\u201d or \u201cone.\u201d \u00a0\n And so. \n \n \n \nWhen I was younger, the \u201cyou\u201d substitution happened more\nfrequently, and more catastrophically. \u00a0\n For example, I regularly used to say, in a fight, right before my exit\nstage left, some rendition of \u201cyou\u2019re crazy.\u201d \u00a0  This is wrong and ableist; and in addition to that, I said\nit precisely when I was afraid I was going to \u201close it\u201d and must therefore\nleave the scene to avoid being viewed engaging in \u201cS.I.B.\u201d etc. \u00a0  I was talking about myself. \u00a0 Back then,  I believed my autism to be a kind of mental illness label because it was in the DSM-III.\u00a0 Maybe it is or was, but anyway, irrelevant. \u00a0  To me it was okay for me\nto be ableist and homophobic about myself, because in my own mind, I was not a\nperson, but an alien, so my respect for persons ethics did not apply. \u00a0  (This history probably contributes to why\nI am so enormously upset by dehumanizing language and the like, other than the\nfact that dehumanizing language and the like is heinous.) \u00a0  Of course, the listener had no way of\nknowing I was talking about myself. \u00a0\u00a0\n For all the world, I had just called her crazy or something equally\noffensive and mean, despite the fact that I have never otherwise assented to wrong-treatment\nof people with mental illness labels such as using them as if they were a slur, or anything like that. \u00a0 It would happen in this one type of case.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Self-loathing is a horrible thing, was for me, made me think nothing of lashing out in ways I can never agree with when I look at them as my full informed self.\u00a0 I see other people doing this kind of thing and it is heartbreaking so I try to be understanding but it is not always easy but I have to try since I was such a punk. \n \n \n \nIf you are reading this, any of you to whom I have done this\nsort of thing, and I have not yet apologized to you, please know that I am very\nsorry about it, and I hope you now know how much I regret not having been able\nto treat you better then. \u00a0  As a kid\nI was troubled and looking back I think unkind and sometimes even ghastly, and now I am happy and probably\nstill sort of annoying, but I do work hard at being decent. \n \n \n \nIn the nineties, when it was all the rage, I was able to\ntake advantage of the fad and do a lot of drilling in \u201cI Language,\u201d which\nhelped a lot with this part of the pronoun problem. \u00a0  But I began to notice it in other people with autism. \u00a0  Even in simple declaratives, such as\nPat telling me I wanted a hot dog. \u00a0\n Of course I did not want a hot dog, as I am vegetarian, but it was easy\nand natural for me to understand his language and realize that he was not\ntrying to prognosticate about my state of hunger in any way. \n \n \n \nStill there are pronoun problems receptively that have not\nbeen drilled out, and I do not know how to drill them out, and I will talk\nabout them here now because people who know me well have encountered this, but\nnot everyone will have done. \u00a0  Also,\nit occurs to me, this might be a problem for others, and if so, it might be a\nproblem for schoolchildren and thus have bearing on say reading comprehension\ntests. \n \n \n \nWhen my friends tell me a story with other people in the\nstory, if there are more than two characters, I may get lost in the pronouns. \u00a0  The proverbial he-said/she-said story\nis often literally the best I can follow, and if there\u2019s another he or she in\nthe mix, I might stop you and say, hang on, will you tell me this again using\neveryone\u2019s name and no pronouns? \u00a0\n This might happen even if the story is simple and obvious. \u00a0  I do not know why. \u00a0  It may not help if I know all the\npeople. \u00a0  It sometimes doesn\u2019t even\nhelp if the sentences start with the correct person\u2019s name! \u00a0  I still can get mixed up, and keep\nstopping your story with confused questions about like, wait-wait, so Jeannie\nwas driving the semi? Hehe no silly, Jeannie is three years old. \u00a0  Pronouns are not my friend. \n \n \n \nThere is a bright side to this. \u00a0  I will use this platform to talk about the bright side\nbecause it can also bring awareness of a thing that is intersectional and not\neveryone may know about. \u00a0  Grin. \u00a0  \n \n \n \nSome people do not use the pronouns 'he/him' or 'she/her' to\nrefer to themselves. \u00a0  For example,\nthey might prefer the singular 'they/their'. \u00a0  There are also a form of pronoun that goes 'ze/zir' and other neologisms related to this. \u00a0  These exist because of rejecting binary\nnotions of gender. \u00a0  However, many\ntimes, others do not respect people\u2019s right to choose their own ways to\nidentify themselves, which disrespect is uncool, or, and I think this is less uncool, but\nsomething I can help with here, they simply are not aware to ask about it,\nbecause not everyone has heard of cutting edge things like rejecting the\nbinary. \n \n \n \nWhen you are like me, and you already know you are going to\nmess up pronouns all over the place, you have a lot of internal latitude to ask\nover and over, and also, you don\u2019t really mess up people\u2019s personal pronouns\nthat much because you have a verbal habit of using names whenever possible to\navoid them. \u00a0  Grin. \u00a0  Bright side. \n \n \n \nNow I would like to warmly invite other people to share\nexperiences related to pronoun mixups, with self or kids, if any such\nexperiences exist. \u00a0  I don\u2019t know\nhow usual these problems are. \n \n \n \nThanks, \n \nIb \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SsUxYXvH4Tg/UYvUQ1K7S_I/AAAAAAAAAIY/1WzALiC5B2w/s1600/designall.jpg"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2013/05/pronoun-problems.html", "title": "\nPronoun Problems (Asides on Self-Loathing and Gender)\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, July 23, 2013", "body": "\nJim Sinclair posted the following correction on the blog just now: \n \n \nThe term \"neurotypical\" did NOT originate the way you claim. It was \ncoined on the old SJU Autism list, during the \"Snore Wars\" in the \naftermath of the 1993 conference where \"Don't Mourn For Us\" was \npresented. It was coined to do exactly what Alyssa said: \" I think we \nneed a word for \"close enough to the alleged norm to get privilege from \nit.\"  \n \nTherefore it is clear to me that the term is older than I had believed by some five years, and did not originate as a joke, because Jim Sinclair is someone who would have authoritative and trustworthy information on this topic. \n \nI should here also clarify that my essay was an argument for the idea that we should move on from this term because of the reasons I specified, and not an attempt to claim that everyone agrees with me.\u00a0 Many do, but many do not. \n \nMy primary reasons are that the term is often used disparagingly, and that it is easily used by accident against people who are not, in fact, accurately described by it. An important thing I think about this second issue is that many of those who fall under categories known as \"mental illness\" and \"intellectual disability\" may be less privileged in some ways as a group, right now, because of political gains we have made since the coining of the term, than are Autistics, and we can do some good here instead of doing harm. \n \nI regret my historical provenance error and thank the ones who had better facts for coming forward. \n \nIn other news, I still agree with myself about the idea that we should recognize gains we have made and behave inclusively toward those with all forms of neurodivergence, including those with greater stigma, and that calling people \"NTs\" does not help us do this.\u00a0 I also reiterate that while I agree with myself and those who agree with me also agree with me, it is manifest that other people do not. \n \nThank you for listening. \n \nLove, \nIb \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2013/07/important-correction-re-origin-of.html", "title": "\nImportant Correction Re: Origin of \"Neurotypical\"\n"},

Click here for better information:  http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2013/07/important-correction-re-origin-of.html  ] \n \n \n \nBut there really is no such thing as a typical neurology,\nmuch less a \u201cNeurotypical,\u201d any more than there are properly such things as\n\u201cNormies,\u201d when it comes to the rich diversity of human life. \n \n \n \n \n \nSometimes the people who say it (or call themselves \u201cNTs\u201d\nfor short) are people without Autism, and they are our allies, and they are\nsaying it in order to show that they in their understanding hold the belief\nthat their allegiance should make them take a one-down position by calling\nthemselves a thing that is really quite insulting. I suspect they believe this\nbecause other people have mistreated us, and they are assuming guilt by\nassociation. Please, friends, stand side by side with us. You are no less than\nus. No one-down. Together. \n \n \n \nSometimes the people who say it are ones who endlessly\nidentify themselves as \u201chigher functioning\u201d or some other kind of relatedly\nself-aggrandizing thing and in fact they believe themselves to be superior to\nothers, including not only other Autistics, but also other people in general. I\njust read a strange article from one known to be such a person urging other\nsuch people to be kind to the \u201cNTs\u201d because it is more sort of polite and\nnoblesse oblige or what have you, all the while still using the name-calling\nterm\u2026 \n \n \n \nBut listen: apart from being insulting, and derived from a\njoke, and long since temporally and culturally outmoded, and theoretically just\nsilly, the whole concept of neurotypicality is fundamentally flawed in ways\nthat *can actually cause harm* and this is why we should all come together and\njust stop saying it. \n \n \n \nNeurodiversity is a real part of the human condition that\nincludes divergence in many directions. It is not only Autism that constitutes\na neurodivergence from the alleged (Alleged! Let me say it again: Alleged!)\nnorm, and by the time we tally up the ways in which the brains of humans can\ndiffer, I\u2019m hard pressed to believe the neurominorities put together will not secretly\nconstitute an actual numerical majority. \n \n \n \n \n \nHere is where harm comes in. \u00a0\n Many of the neurological situations a person can have cause even more\nstigma than Autism now, because we have, of late, gained some political power\nthanks to ASAN, AWN and some of our freewheeling awesome activists and Social\nMedia Crises (you know who you are and we love you xxoo). \u00a0  For this reason, people may not feel\ncomfortable being out at work about disclosing that they have bipolar\ndepression, for example, or using it freely with identity first language. We\ncan think of many other examples, not just involving the stigmatization of what\nare called \u201cmental illnesses\u201d but also neurologies called \u201cintellectual\ndisabilities.\u201d Are such people \u201cNT\u201d? No. But a number of the types of people on\nthe autism spectrum who are happy to call other people \u201cNTs\u201d seem also quick\nand happy to throw others under the bus if that it what it takes to make sure\nnobody blames anything on \u201cthe spectrum.\u201d \n \n \n \nThis is not only morally wrong and sickmaking but a social\njustice misstep and has to stop at once. \n \n \n \nIn this little article I\u2019m talking mostly to Auts of all\nstripes but I also want to talk to parents. If you think about Neurodiversity\nin a Big Tent ( thanks to Liz Cagle and Michael Scott Monje Jr. for this superbly visual way of thinking of it, which also articulates some more physical manifestations of neurodivergence ) you may find that you have more in\ncommon with your kids than you first imagined. You may also have custom-made brains! \u00a0  Search yourself and your past and see if it\nisn\u2019t true. Depression? Anxiety? Dyslexia? Band together! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd I, and many, many (ever-increasingly many) of my friends\nwill stand with you. \n \nFirst, do no harm. \n \n \n \nSecond, see what we have in common. \n \n \n \nThird, let\u2019s have a cup of tea. \u00a0  Because tea.

{"date": "Thursday, August 15, 2013", "body": "\n6 is my favorite number. \n \nAlso, there is another meaning. \n \nGround rules alert: this is not a forum to talk about how we feel about war.\u00a0 This is about the lived lives of people, of the veterans, and the fact that many people who go to war acquire disabilities, and thus become disabled, and we who are disabled already know how to be disabled, and we who are family members of disabled people already know how to be family members of disabled people. \n \n \n \n\"Got your 6\" is a military translation for the idiom \"Got your back\" which came about because of WWI fighter pilots' picturing of the airspace round their planes as being like a clock, with the nose being 12 (so the tail is 6).\u00a0 Here, watch this PSA: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNow, they don't go into the disabled part of it, but it's there, and we all know it.\u00a0 People lose limbs and get PTSD, and we know about that stuff.\u00a0 This is one of the giant reasons why we need to have celebrities and organized campaigns to make sure veterans can get jobs and they and their families can be taken care of when they get back. \n \nThey don't know how to be disabled already, or necessarily what is the best way to be supportive family members.\u00a0 We do.\u00a0 We can help.\u00a0 We can have their 6. \n \n \n \nThere's one more thing about this.\u00a0 Goodwill is one of the sponsors, so there's a good side effect of our supporting this particular campaign.\u00a0 Because disabled veterans have not been disabled the whole time, they will not likely have been conditioned to take kindly to the practice of sub-minimum wage payment that goes on in Goodwill shops in states where that is still an available legal loophole.\u00a0 So there will be fresh new sets of eyes on that problem: angry eyes, and many.\u00a0 This bodes well for change. \n \nAnd I'll say one last thing: we may sometimes unfortunately tend to think of life from a scarcity model, like this: if veterans get jobs, there'll me none left for me, or for my child.\u00a0 That's not really useful, or really real.\u00a0 Campaigns that create jobs boost the economy, and, by definition, create jobs.\u00a0 Also, campaigns that call attention to societal needs call attention to societal needs, which causes an aura effect causing attention to be pulled toward adjacent and related needs. \n \nThe ADA was not signed because of the people in wheelchairs who were relatively socially powerless.... \n \nIf we think generously, we think better.\u00a0 We build coalitions.\u00a0 We look for commonalities and in our social usefulness we live lives of greater fulness. Let's be there for the veterans and their families because we have knowledge and skills that may be of service in untapped ways.\u00a0 And in so doing we may make new friends, friends whose knowledge and skills may further the good of everyone.\u00a0 And these new friends may find themselves serving their country alongside us in exciting, novel ways they could never have imagined. \n \nLove, \nIb \n \nO & P.S. Here is the website to check it out:  http://www.gotyour6.org/  . I had forgotten to link to it and Andrew Dell'Antonio who is extremely awesome gave me the reminder!\u00a0 xxoo\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.gotyour6.org/"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2013/08/got-your-6.html", "title": "\nGot Your 6\n"},

He was\nofficially diagnosed a little over a year ago. He has a consistent vocabulary\nof about 8 to 10 words and seems to be really learning a lot at school and\nenjoying himself. It's very clear he understands a lot of what is going on. We\nhave our bumpy days, (as does everybody), but overall life is very good. \n \n \n \n I'm actually writing b/c I need advice for how to handle some\nneurotypical people in our life. I feel like most family members (on both sides\nof the family) are very fixated on the \"talking thing.' I hear a lot of\n\"is he talking more?\" \"When will he start talking more?\"\nEvery time I share one of his successes at school or home I hear \"Does\nthis mean he'll talk more?\" \n \n \n \n I don't want to make it seem like I'm anti-talking or that I've\ncompletely ruled it out for my son's future, but I've broadened my ideas of\ncommunication so that I don't see lack of talking as lack of success. How can I\nget our family on that same page? I feel like they still have a lot of pity and\nfear feelings around disabilities/differences that they need to work through. \n \n \n \n I've tried leading this conversation gently \"You might like\nthis book\" \"You might like this documentary\" \"He might\nnever grow up to be a talker and if he doesn't that's okay.\" Nothing\nreally seems to sink in for long. They slip back into \"talking is the\ndefault way to communicate/be\" very quickly. \n \n \n \n They are all long distance and don't get to see the day to day\ntriumphs and progress. Do I give them more time to process because they are\nmore removed? Do I keep on the gentle path? They (usually) don't talk about\nthis stuff in front of my son, but every time they talk this way it hurts me\n(even though I realize this is not about me) and leaves me with the feeling\nthey can't fully accept him b/c they are holding out for something\n\"better.\" Do I just flat out start telling them that this is hurtful? \n \n \n \n I'm usually someone who tries to avoid confrontation, but I'm\nstarting to feel that it might have to be done. \n \n \n \n You always seem to deal with everyone and their questions with\nsuch wisdom and compassion. Any advice in this situation? \n \n \n \n Thanks for everything you do, \n \n Just call me \n \n \n \n \"Dealing with Family Matters\" \n \n \n \n Dear Dealing with Family\nMatters,  \n \n \n \n (This took me ages and\nages to answer, not least because I could fully answer one layer but not the\nother, or not to my satisfaction. Now I have been to Syracuse and can answer\nbetter along both axes. Thank you so much for your patience, DWFM!) \n \n \n \n Thank you so much for\nwriting, and for trusting me with this problem. \u00a0\n I have been thinking about it for ages, and it is a very real problem. \u00a0  I will speak directly to you, and I also\nbelieve you have many unseen friends out there experiencing almost exactly the\nsame thing, who will relate to you. \u00a0\n Maybe they will answer this post and you can become friends. \u00a0  Support of people who know first-hand what\nyou\u2019re talking about is a wonderful thing. \u00a0\n I speak to you all, really. \n \n \n \n What I will do is speak\nfrom my brain and experiences and observations and also from my heart, and\nstart with the adage my wise friend Souci taught me when I was a whelp: \u201cTake\nwhat you need, and leave the rest.\u201d \n \n \n \n The first thing I want\nto say is that I was flapping when your focus of sight was about how often they\nmostly did not do this in front of your son, showing both that you are thinking\nthat if they did, he would notice and care (instead of being incompetent) and\nalso that you think his welfare is utmost, because you are an awesome parent. \u00a0  And you are trying to be gentle with your\nfamily and give them the benefit of the doubt. \u00a0\n That\u2019s actually a really good thing too. \u00a0\n I\u2019ll say more. \n \n \n \n When you say it is not\nabout you, I want to say it does get to be about you, sometimes, because you\nare a person and you are hurting. \u00a0  That\nis reason enough, but there is more. \u00a0\n So. \u00a0  This: you are clearly not the\nkind of person that makes everything be all about you as a general\ncharacteristic, which buys you more it-gets-to-be-about-you-for-a-change-now. \u00a0  For one thing, none of the text in your\nletter was lengthy declarative proclamations on the topic of what a giving\ngiver you are, always giving, never a thought for yourself (a specific type of\nlanguage use which I have noticed in my travels seems almost invariably to be a\nkind of code, a type of opposite-speak bafflingly concomitant with self-involved\naction sequences). \n \n \n \n Sometimes people like\nyou who actually are giving people who think of others first need to hear a\nlogical reordering argument in order to believe that it is OK to defend their\nown selves from hurt. \u00a0  I will use a quick\nargument from analogy in the form of a potentially random sounding metaphor. \u00a0  I trust you will see what I am doing right\naway, so I will keep it short and not belabor it. \u00a0  Here goes: \n \n \n \n When people hurt my\nmother, especially relatives, I always notice (even though she is fabulous at\nhiding it, according to the rest of the world) and feel it keenly, and am\ngreatly distressed. \u00a0  The less I can do\nabout it, the worse I feel. \n \n \n \n There. \u00a0  I believe we have incontrovertibly\nestablished that it is OK for you to deal with the issue even though you are\nthe primary person being hurt by their words at this time. \u00a0 :) \n \n \n \n (And I stopped writing\nhere for a long while, because I knew I could only really answer half the\nquestion, and now I will continue\u2026) \n \n \n \n There are two axes of\nwhat to do. One is internal and one is external. The external I learned more\nabout at  Syracuse ICI Summer Institute  (where I think everyone should go) (and I don't think you have to wait 'til summer to check them out) and hence can now finish this post. \n \n \n \n Internally, I can only\nhope this information helps you to gird your loins, and it is this. All the\npeople are brainwashed into believing that talking is the only kind of\ncommunication that counts. This is particularly true in the relatively recent\ntimes, when ABA and ABA derivative peddlers made sure everyone heard that they\nand what they sell are the only \u201cresearch-based\u201d thing on the planet that could\never help anyone have a life, and the only kind of life was a life of\nyimmer-yammer, and it was patently impossible to learn to yimmer-yammer if one\ndid not do so prior to the age of five, at which time one turned into a\npumpkin, because one\u2019s parents were\nwoefully-scientifically-ignorant-read-negligent, and you know, since it takes a\nvillage, any parent allowed to be that ignorant in this the famous information\nage must have really ignorant and callous friends and relations. \n \n \n \n Tracy Thresher and Larry Bissonnette stand on either side of a giant green sign that reads: \"Not being able to speak is not the same as not having anything to say - Rosemary Crossley.\" \n \n \n \n A great deal of time and\nmoney as well as academic and political power and savvy were spent trying to\nmake sure this would become engrained in our public imagination as \u201ca well\nknown fact.\u201d \u00a0  I think the reader will\nrecognize that all that stuff about ABA and the age of 5 and so forth doesn\u2019t even sound funny or\nwoo. \u00a0  It sounds true, and fitting, kind\nof like we ought to brush our teeth. \n \n \n \n It is not, in reality,\ntrue in the same way that it is true we ought to brush our teeth. It is true in\na way much more analogous to the way in which it is true that we ought to own\nan imitation paramilitary SUV in order to be more safe on the roads. (In other words, not true.) \n \n \n \n Your family more than\nlikely does not mean to hurt you when it parrots back to you advertising about\nhow those imitation paramilitary SUVs are really safer for your kids, because that little foreign econo-job\nyou are driving would squash like a bug they just know it. A lot of thought and\nmoney went into making sure they would believe what they believe, or believe\nthey know what they believe they know. And also your little econo-job is much safer,\nPS; you checked when you bought it. But that will never be allowed to be the\nfirst few hits on their Google search, or Google goes under. \n \n \n \n What I think your family\nactually means to do, most of the time, with this, is show caring. They are\nsaying something like this: I care, and I want to show that I care by showing\nthat I Googled stuff, because in my imagination you will notice that means I\nwas thinking of you. However, I did not think this through and realize that\nbecause it is your life and the life of your own child, you probably have much\nmore in depth and relevant knowledge; and maybe a more fitting and useful concept of a way\nfor me to show caring would be to listen, or give you cake and tea. \u00a0  Tea! \n \n \n \n Now: before I get on to\nthe second part about their actual education, I want to talk about what to do\nabout this part, which is what to do about how they are hurting your feelings. \n \n \n \n It depends on your\npersonal style, and what you feel comfortable doing and saying, and what you\nknow of them and who they are.\u00a0 Just one thing before I start saying this stuff.\u00a0 I noticed you think of all of this as a confrontation, and it might help you if you reorganize it in your head as another thing which is not confrontation but rather the offering of information, because that is also really real: you are giving information to people, and that is not a thing which is a bad thing. It is a doable thing, a helpful thing, and useful.\u00a0 OK. \n \n \n \n One thing you could do\nwould be to really tell them what you told me. It hurts. It hurts you. You\ncould stop it there, as a separate issue from the educational issue, because if\nyou imagine that your family does not want to hurt you or your child, you can\nsay this. You can imagine that they do not know they hurt you and would want to\nknow so that they can stop. Explain your feelings to them and let them be there\nfor you in ways they cannot if they do not know it\u2019s needed. \n \n \n \n Another thing you can do\nif it is not in your family culture to talk about hurt feelings and you don\u2019t\nwant to do the educational features right now is cut if off at the knees. \u00a0  You can say a thing like, that is all, I no\nlonger wish to discuss anything having to do with language, there will be no\nlinguistic discussion in my house. \u00a0\n (Sometimes this makes people say, But why? And you might then develop a\nsituation where you go back to the first thing\u2026so it might be an opening to an\nnew epoch of family culture on emo-speak\u2026) \n \n \n \n A third thing you could\ndo is launch straight into educational mode, not gently, as you have said that\ndoes not work, but as Captain Super Professor! Able To Assist The Misguided At\nA Moment\u2019s Notice! The Minute They Accidentally Utter Some Ignorant Thing! \u00a0  This can be kind of empowering and may tend\nto put you in a good mood. \u00a0  It is kind of\nmy lifestyle. I mean I am a little bit gentle in that I am in a good mood most\nof the time, but I am not, you know, difficult to read or understand. I do not\nsay, you might like this movie some day, I say: This! Movie! Here! \u2018Tis The One\nFor You Now! (pressing an actual copy of Wretches and Jabberers into your hand)\u2026. \n \n \n \n Which does bring me to\neducation. \n \n \n \n That is the second prong\nand the one I didn\u2019t feel adequate to answer about until I got back from\nSyracuse having met a wide variety of more people than I already knew, who live\ngood, successful lives without talking, or talking much. So I will list now a\nbunch of people I know in case you\nwant to go the Totally Educational route. \u00a0\n Which I hope you do. \u00a0  And I\nrealize I don\u2019t have to write as much about that as I had thought, because they\nhave done so. (And you can show them everything I have to say about Eric, who\ndoesn\u2019t bother talking or writing much but can save my life in the sea, and\nlives exactly as he likes.) There is no problem about my inadequacy as a non-speaker because the non-speakers I know can speak volumes about it! Volumes and DVDs, youtube clips and blogs and more! \n \n \n \n Please write back and\nlet me know how everything goes. \n \n \n \n Love,  \n \n Ib \n \n \n \n OK so the List starts here just with some people who have produced media and I personally know: \n \n \n \n Amy Sequenzia  \n \n DJ Savarese \n \n Jamie Burke \n \n Sue Rubin \n \n Jenn Seybert \n \n Mark Utter \n \n Tracy Thresher \n \n Larry Bissonette Peyton Goddard \n \n \n \n These people hardly talk if at all.\u00a0 Many more of us move in and out of talking, like for example sometimes talking a lot and sometimes not at all. Let me know if you want the list of us and where we talk (or...something analogous) about that!\u00a0 \n \n PS Also, other readers please help with this, \nplease list other resources you know to help educate DWFM's family.\u00a0 \nSince that's just who I personally know, I know other people I know and don't know must know other people I don't know yet.\u00a0 Such as Barb Rentenbach, I don't know her yet and she has a great book I'm hearing now!

She talked to my dad about it and they remembered what really helped. \n \nDo a geographic.\u00a0 When the other kids have become being like that, nothing will stop them being how they are being and doing the doing of those ways.\u00a0 It has become the social milieu and it is not up to any one person to change a culture.\u00a0 So you can leave.\u00a0 Exit stage left. \n \n \n \n[Here is a photo of an actual old tin theatre sign, which says Exit Stage Left, with an arrow pointing left, and the iconic Tragedy and Comedy masks appear to be hanging from the top corner.] \n \nThe exit stage left, ahhhhhh.\u00a0 I think this changed my life. \n \nIt can be another school, it can be homeschooling, this is not something I can say, but of this I am sure: one cannot live in a social situation in which one cannot live.\u00a0 Escape hatch! \n \nBut this brings me to the second thing, and I do believe I can really say this to you because you seem like the kind of person who can understand and make it happen.\u00a0 When I said I couldn't say where to escape to?\u00a0 It's because I don't know your daughter, and she seems from your letter to be old enough to be the kind of person who would have something to say about that, and nothing about us without us, which you totally get, and that drew me to your letter.\u00a0 I hope you are in a location where she can find others to hang out with who are cooler, and she might have some ideas about where this is likely to be for her.\u00a0 Or, she might not.\u00a0 But get her out of that hellhole, because at least new people will be new and not have a toxic history together. \n \nOne of the things that also felt really good to me as I started growing up, by the way, was political activism... we didn't have the Autistic Community back then because I am really super old, but I loved trying to subvert the dominant paradigm about other injustices going on. \n \nDo you think she would like to write to me and get in touch with some older Auts online maybe?\u00a0 Help create a website for kids her own age who are interested in what she cares about, to chat?\u00a0 Lordy, I wish we'd had the Internet. \n \nThinking good thoughts for you.\u00a0 Write back and let me know how things are going? \n \nLove, \nIb\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tinygracenotes.com/2013/08/letter-from-devoted-phoenix-part-1.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-73TSCnw1jfk/Uh59LmJ12LI/AAAAAAAAARE/zFn0vm5s4j8/s1600/exit_stage_left.jpg"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2013/08/letter-from-devoted-phoenix-part-2-me.html", "title": "\nLetter From Devoted Phoenix, Part 2 (Answer)\n"},

The other friend, who is also super supportive, took this personally, what the first friend said, took it as a kind of indictment against those who do not or cannot exit stage left. \n \nBoth of these people are people I've spent a good deal of time with in real life and seen them with their kids so I know they are *absolutely fabulous parents* as well as this: when I say they are my friends I do not mean \"acquaintances.\"\u00a0 I'm using the term the opposite of loosely. \n \nSo I cannot possibly let go the fact that my answer had in it the power to cause this kind of hurt due to the fact that I did not write part of it adequately. \n \nI must fix it.\u00a0 Important note: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[Photographic image here of a hand holding out an envelope stamped with a giant, red, official-looking seal of the word \"IMPORTANT\" in all capital letters with a red border. It is not letter-sized, but rather note-sized, the envelope.] \n \nHere are some things I absolutely did not mean under any circumstances.\u00a0 I did not mean to imply that all the problems that there are would be resolved by doing a geographic and exiting stage left, and by extension I super mega extra did not mean to imply that families for whom this is not an option or the best solution are doing a bad job in some way.\u00a0 I mean things very, very contextually; in that answer, I was talking about situations like the one being described in the original letter written by DP,  which is linked here. \n \nIn real life,\u00a0 it is difficult in many places to get transferred to another school, or granted the ability to homeschool (if you wanted to go for that) and it would be especially difficult if there were no evidence that the school setting itself was part of the problem, or the bulk of the problem.\u00a0 However, from the evidence in the letter I deduce it will be very easy for DP's family to show (even almost *prove*) that the social scene at this particular school is a Big Giant Issue if not the primary and immediate emergency in her daughter's life right now. \n \nAlso if any services are being used that are actually helpful, it is not easy to keep these services going in many states or districts while pursuing other placement options. \n \nWhat I am very sorry about here is that it seems like I made exit stage left sound like: 1. the solution to everything, which I totally disagree with, because it's simply not true; and 2. it's just ever so easy, which was hurtful to my friend. \u00a0The first is pretty embarrassing to me as a writer, but I'm extremely sorry about the second thing. \n \nI exited high school using a technique that is probably very traditional but that I do not recommend. I am going to say a little about it here to try to rectify the pain I caused and also I hope the book comes out soon wherein I have a chapter all about my schooling years, because it details this situation much better.\u00a0 The book comes out this Fall.\u00a0 I will let you know. \n \nSo: the method that happened for me was extreme truancy because I could not bring myself to go in that place. I would get ready to try every day and I didn't put this in my chapter and I still don't know if my parents know this so it's a new piece of exclusive information for you, TGN readers.\u00a0 I always took the bus to the correct bus stop for that high school and then took to my heels, even if the places I would ultimately end up that day were several miles away.\u00a0 Always.\u00a0 I did try.\u00a0 But I could not, like I said, get myself in there.\u00a0 Although sometimes I sat in a tree on the grounds because I did love that tree, from which I could see a fountain.\u00a0 Anyway. \n \nI became expelled from that high school which is the horribly non-easy method my parents had to deal with, the news of my extreme/complete truancy hitting them out of nowhere as I had not been able to communicate my distress to them properly because I did not have the words. \n \nThen my parents fought very very hard to get me placed in an alternative school. This also was not easy for them.\u00a0 Any problems I might have had there would *not* have been solved by a geographic because it was a very good placement, so these problems were solved in *other* ways. \n \nI am sorry for the misunderstanding. \n \nThank you for listening. \n \nMuch love, \nIb \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tinygracenotes.com/2013/08/letter-from-devoted-phoenix-part-2-me.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1gt8v7P2yZI/UiJPsjge3SI/AAAAAAAAARw/W9KQsbbOhk8/s1600/images.jpg", "http://www.tinygracenotes.com/2013/08/letter-from-devoted-phoenix-part-1.html"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2013/08/letter-from-devoted-phoenix-part-3.html", "title": "\nLetter From Devoted Phoenix, Part 3 (Important Note)\n"},

This time it didn't work, thank heaven, but members of the media as well as key \"parent\" bloggers are as usual taking the opportunity to present the grisly, unnatural and horrific acts as somehow logical, to further their complex and spiteful agenda. \n \n \n \nThey are callously using these troubled criminals, in other words, and calling them \"typical parents\" doing \"understandable acts of desperation\" at the expense of real parents everywhere. Don't fall for it, and don't stand for it. Speak out. \n \n \n \nThought experiment: You hear a news report that a promising young high school football player with a scholarship to Notre Dame after graduation was gunned down in cold blood by his mother. It comes out that she had called, even taken time off her minimum wage job so she could try in person, begged at least seven times for more food stamps because Jim's training schedule started making him so hungry she could no longer afford to feed him. They ignored her. She is quoted as saying she saw no way out but to kill him: Julie had known hunger, and vowed her boy never would. \n \n \n \nNow. Are we going to be deluged with crap blaming the boy for being inconvenient, or will we be shown a lovely pic of him as a heroic young life cut short? \n \n \n \nWill she be painted as society's victim, one of us? Or perhaps...someone who killed her own child: a child-killer. The very worst kind of criminal we can think of. She's poor and the kid was not disabled, so... \n \n \n \nI'll stop with that. But you see why I'm so sick. Wrongness is happening on so many levels and not just to Autistics. They are doing this to our parents, and our whole civilization. \n \n \n \nPlease stand with us and say NO in any way you can think of, every chance you get. \n \n \n \nEvil is NOT the typical response to being under resourced. We cannot allow this myth to take hold and dig deeper cultural roots. In short: we need more resources and that is the truth.

This is the\nkind of love which does not seek anything in return, a kind of love that moves\nyou to action on behalf of other people\u2019s benefit because you really care about\nhow they are faring. It is not an emotional love that needs things in return,\nand it certainly is not a greed for your own fame or fortune. Real charitable\nlove, or agape, would never, ever seek to tear down, demean, dehumanize or in\nany other way harm the people it purported to help. Think about love and think\nabout what I am saying and you might wonder how recipients of really decent\ncharities feel about those charities. \u00a0\n Boycotty? No. \n \n \n \nYou may have heard a lot about Autism Speaks lately, because\nof the boycott, because we are so weary of being misused by them, because it is\nthe opposite of a real charity; it is the opposite of what I am talking about\nwhen I talk about charitable love. It makes me want to tell you about a place I\nused to go which was quite exactly what I am talking about, and was such a\nshining example I can use it to explain the positive aspects in graphic detail. \n \n \n \nAllow me to introduce Sisters of the Road Caf\u00e9, in Portland,\nOregon. \u00a0  I was a recipient of their\ncharity long ago and when my fortunes improved I became more of a deliberate\nvolunteer. My dignity and status were the same in both events. \u00a0  This is important because it is the\nperfect example of what I mean. \n \n \n \nSisters of the Road does nothing about us without us. They\nfeed homeless people and hook them up with resources and community. And the\n\u2018they\u2019 was \u2018us\u2019 for me both when I was homeless and when I was not. You could\nget a really good, filling, delicious, satisfying meal there for $1.25 and a cup\nof coffee for a quarter. \u00a0  That was\nway less than other places. If you did not have the money you could sign up to\nhelp wash dishes or bus tables\u2014or even be wait staff if you were that brave\n(not me) \u2013for just one 15 minute shift casually to pay for that meal. \u00a0  Also you could do another 15 to pay for\na friend. Now that is dignity. The place itself was modest but nice to be\naround and nobody was all \u201cmove along.\u201d For me it was a serious Godsend as I was\nnot able to panhandle because too shy for that direct of social contact with\nstrangers so a lot of times if I had a sore throat or something the singing in\nthe streets thing didn\u2019t happen, but I could get fed and treat a friend to\nlunch no matter what, in a place where we were welcome.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0[Image: photo from inside Sisters of the Road nowadays. The cafe has nice wooden chairs now and the lovely old wooden siding still. Two apparently African American men but they could be islanders or African of course, also they could be transmen, I don't know them personally, anyway they are in the foreground and the one who has my favorite red beans and rice in front of him is laughing uproariously with his head thrown back. The one with him is pointing at him with a big smile as if to say \"gotcha.\" The one who is totally laughing has a powerchair which you can see the controls. Other diners of a variety of skin tones, gender presentations, ways of looking, etc. are throughout and the place and people just still seem as welcoming and friendly as I remember.] \n \n \n \n \nWhich brings me to this too: It was very rare back then to\nbe able to get vegetarian food, but they always had it in addition to hearty meat dishes. They also had this kick\nass Puerto Rican salsa, because one of the steady volunteers or workers was\nfrom there and knew how to do it. (People who really worked there for a wage or\nwere steady volunteers did not act better than anyone or better than each other.\nYou could pick them out only because they worked for longer than 15-30 minute\nstretches.) Nobody sneered at vegetarianism and said, \u201cBeggars can\u2019t be\nchoosers.\u201d I am sorry that so many religiously based organizations at that time\n(late eighties; I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if it\u2019s the same now) had personnel who\nliked saying that demeaning bromide when I shyly asked if there was peanut\nbutter at all, but I wasn\u2019t just being picky. My vegetarianism is long-standing\nand stems from deeply held personal beliefs. \u00a0  And even if I were just being picky, why rub it in that\nsomeone\u2019s life is hard if yours is a bit better and you are allegedly trying to\nhelp? \n \n \n \nGenny Nelson was the boss of Sisters of the Road at that\ntime and also later when I was more on my feet and came back around (she is\nretired now). She was there a lot and rolled up her sleeves and pitched in.\nShe had been one of the inventors of it and when inventing it what she and her\npartner had done is asked around and found out what would be useful and good\nfor actual people and what would not. I do not know if she had heard the slogan\n\u201cNothing About Us Without Us\u201d but she sure did live by it and also create an\norganization that was founded on it, as well as the true meaning of Caritas,\nwhich is the root word for \u201ccharity,\u201d which, as I said, is the Latin\ntranslation for Agape, rendered well in English as unselfish love. \n \n \n \nSo Sisters of the Road is earmarked for homeless people,\nmany of whom are Autistic and otherwise neurodivergent, partially because a lot of the big alleged charities for Autistic folks do not provide much real life help at all, so good\npeople who want to help others are accidentally throwing their money to the greed\nmachine while the people they wanted to help are left floundering. \n \n \n \nThe straight up Autism charities that exemplify Nothing\nAbout Us Without Us are actually run by Autistics. These are Autism Women\u2019s\nNetwork (AWN) and Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN). \u00a0  Autism Women\u2019s Network is working on getting together\nsome more on-the-ground initiatives, to get money and resources back to the right\npeople who need it.   Autistic Self Advocacy Network has\ncreated a sea change in the way Autistics are able to see ourselves and come\ntogether in action, as well as carve a place for ourselves at policy tables,\neven at the very highest levels. This has literally changed the world for me and many people I know. I think\nASAN is also looking into a grants program. Both of these groups increase our\ndignity and well-being every day without wasting good people\u2019s money lining\ngreedy pocketbooks or financing harmful ad campaigns or research into\npreventing us from being born. Both of these groups are bona fide what a\ncharity should be, and growing and doing more every moment of every day with\nyour help.  \n \n \n \nBack to Sisters of the Road: Sisters of the Road, I salute\nyou. The xxx symbol someone anonymously chalked onto the sidewalk to denote good food and hospitality in hobo code was apt and true and I will love you forever. Readers, if\nyou give them a little bit of money too, there is no way you won\u2019t be helping\nsome Autistics, because so many of us are pushed through the cracks into\npoverty and homelessness at some point in our lives. \n \nHere is their website:\u00a0 http://sistersoftheroad.org/  .

{"date": "Monday, September 23, 2013", "body": "\n \n Dear Ibby,\u00a0 \n \n So\n I have what should be a really simple question to answer, and \nyet...maybe not.\u00a0 \n \n It's about crossing a busy crosswalk without adult \nassistance. My 12-year-old son just started middle school; to get him \nthere, I drop him off at a busy corner with a crosswalk. Only difference\n from elementary school is that there's no crossing guard.\u00a0 \n \n This morning,\n he was the only one in the crosswalk, and with my \"cross safely\" \nringing in his ears he...stopped. Waited for the cars there to go. They \nwaited for him. The drivers started waving him across. But he, of \ncourse, was not looking at the drivers. He was just waiting. Honking \nstarted. I finally rolled down the window and said, \"OK, go ahead, safe \nto cross!\" And he, without looking first to be sure nothing had changed \nwhile I said that, darted across. Something about the whole thing \nworried me.\u00a0 \n \n My question then: How do I teach him to look INSIDE the cars\n to see if the driver sees him, if the driver is waving him on, if the \ndriver is NOT seeing him and is about to drive forward, etc.? This is \ngoing to come up when he starts to drive, too. Is there a simple way to \naddress this tendency to just think, \"the rule is that I can go when \nthere are no cars at the crosswalk\" or something like that, and not to \nadjust depending on the situation? Most mornings, he won't the be only \none crossing. But when he is...I need him to be safe, and I can't think \nof a single simple \"rule\" he can use; the situation is always different,\n and I won't always be situated so I can direct him from my own car. \nIdeas? And THANK YOU. \n \n Lori\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [Visual image of an official DOT crosswalk sign, person in silhouette crossing street on yellow background]   \n \n \n \n \n Dear Lori,\u00a0 \n \n This is a great and useful question that is the opposite of a simple question! You are right! Should be: isn't. \n \n So I wracked my brains trying to remember how I found out about looking inside of the car to see if they can see you and whether they are going to run over you about it, and could not do it by myself. So I called up the person who would have taught this information to me! (This is the key to good research skills, by the way. If you know who knows, it's as good as knowing it yourself.) \n \n My mom said it made total sense to not want to be embarrassing him by being the hand-holdy mother all draped over his business if there are other kids around, but when there are no other kids, this will work better with you not in the car, because he can follow your head with his head and hear your words up close.\u00a0 You narrate with him what to do, always using the same words, never changing it up.\u00a0 \"Look left, look right, look left again. Are there any cars? Neither side? Safe to cross. A stopped car nearby? Look inside. Can the driver see you? How do you know? Smiling and waving and not going? OK to start. Now look back right. A stopped car? Can he see you?\" Etc. In the car on the way there you can do this decision chart. He will know it in his head when he is with the other kids and you can hide and watch from your car to feel better, but he should get it pretty soon and get comfy.  \n \n When my mom was telling me about the above I started remembering it, the rhythm of it. As a matter of fact my mom had to get off the phone pretty quick but I suspect she stealthily slipped a bunch of good manners information into these rhythmic safety algorithms. (As you are reading this, Mom, note that I gotcha.) Because I have a dim memory of this being around the time I learned the thank-you wave that I still to this day use while I myself am driving, or when I do have the pedestrian right of way on a crowded urban turn lane and the driver did smile and wave me through, but it is still nice to acknowledge not being run over. \n \n I am a very safe walker and driver now, and polite, and also very good with algorithms such as who goes where on a broken signal light. I am, astonishingly, not the one who gets confused in such situations. \n \n Neither will your son be.\u00a0 There is a bright side to all of this.\u00a0 :) \n \n (In other related news: Another\n thing I have to remember to this day is how to act like I am trying to \ncross the street instead of trying to randomly loiter in the general vicinity. This is another \nissue I don't know if he has, but it might be a thing.\u00a0 Look purposeful about I Am Crossing The Street Just So You Know and the car drivers will be more likely to Take Notice.) \n \n   \n \n Write back and let me know how it all goes? \n \n Love, Ib \n \n O and PS: If this is not quick enough, remember that you can buy time by rousing the neighborhood and agitating for a traffic light.\u00a0 Let me know if this is something you want to do and I will put you in touch with some people who have done it and know exactly how to make it happen. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PA9XIpYG3bo/UkByD3tIXAI/AAAAAAAAATk/iu7nMkxxd88/s1600/crosswalk.jpg"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2013/09/crossing-street-with-neither-guard-nor.html", "title": "\nCrossing The Street With Neither Guard Nor Signal\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 1, 2013", "body": "\nSome of the excellent answers on the last blog post about crossing the street, which I'll repost  HERE  in case you didn't get a chance to read the comment thread, led me to write this other article about workarounds. \n \n \n \n \n[Visual is a graphic drawing of a hammer superimposed on a blueprint, with the words \"Workaround Workshop\" surrounding the image.] \n \nEveryone learns differently, and when you're teaching things to people, remembering to presume competence, it sometimes comes to the attention of both of you that there is some kind of real block against that particular type of thing. \n \nA word about presuming competence. \n \nTo presume competence is to give someone the benefit of the doubt instead of just saying, Oh, Alas, This Person Is Obviously Incompetent In Every Way And Practically Not Even Here. Because your person is more than likely there, and can hear you do this.\u00a0 I talk about that some length  HERE  toward the end of this article. But on the other side, it also doesn't mean assuming anyone is a magic superhero who is terrific at everything. Nobody is like that.\u00a0 Autistic people such as myself often have particular areas which are super extra hard for us, and we cannot get past a wall in them. That is what some of the commentators in that last post were talking about, and what I can talk about in this post, regarding time. \n \nAnd it brings us to Workarounds. Workarounds are our friends.\u00a0 Workarounds are what you come up with to get around, over, or some other kind of way past that wall instead of bashing your head against it. \n \nI'll talk about myself.\u00a0 Time is a thing I do not really get properly, despite the fact that I can appear to \"tell time\" although I am not very rapid at it.\u00a0 I can read to you off an analog or digital watch.\u00a0 I also always wear one because the alarms are helpful for me.\u00a0 But I do not feel time elapsing in the proper way, and I am sure this is the case because I have interviewed many people about the real way time is supposed to feel.\u00a0 From my perspective, time seems so arbitrary as to be fake, like a trick.\u00a0 When I wrote  THIS , I was doing what my grandmother called \"kidding on the square,\" which is kind of joking, but kind of telling the truth. \n \nIt is not as if I was never taught how to tell time properly.\u00a0 I was.\u00a0 As a matter of fact I have such a deep and vast knowledge of time-telling pedagogy that I can teach teachers how to teach time-telling very effectively to a wide range of children and this is a huge part of my job.\u00a0 It is just that there is a block in my brain about it for some reason.\u00a0 I have other friends who are opposite of that, who can tell time better than clocks.\u00a0 If you had a clock and Bridget who blogs   HERE  saying different things, you should fix your clock. \n \nSo now I come to the Workaround.\u00a0 Whatever it is that you or your kid just can't seem to get past, be it crossing the street without a light because it feels like mindreading cars, or having a feel for time, there are ways around it.\u00a0 Come up with plans and you will be golden. \n \nFor me, I get that commercials are shorter than movies, so I have some sense of not saying \"I'll be back in a minute\" if I am going to do something that is more like going to a movie than the time span of a commercial. And a ball game is longer than a movie, so. Another part of my workaround system is technology.\u00a0 I have a lot of gadgets helping me, alarms, talking computer, etc.\u00a0 People help me too.\u00a0 Since I am a professor and people look to me to be in charge of when break-times and things are, I openly tell them it is OK to remind me, and I tell them why, but I also use great software for the iPod like the  Visual Timer  that is quick and easy to customize and set and doesn't make noise. In airports, I alert the flight personnel that I am there so I don't space out too much and miss the flight. They are very kind about this. \n \nAnother thing I do is try to be early rather than late, but to be honest time is still a large source of anxiety since it is a thing that I am relatively clueless about. When I get the chance to be interdependent about it instead of trying to rely on all my own self, I am much more relaxed, and that's OK today. It wasn't always. I wish I had learned this younger.\u00a0 This is different from learned helplessness.\u00a0 I am not helpless; I am getting help for myself in real ways that will really work, and in turn I am helpful to others in other ways that play to my various strengths. I just no longer have to injure myself out of false pride, because I now understand that I don't have to try and act \"perfect\" all the time, which just breaks me down and makes everything worse. \n \nSo if you are a parent or a teacher, you might be able to help younger kids who are Autistic find out workarounds for themselves based on checking out what they are good at and what they are interested in and tying that into a way to get success working around the problems of what is not happening for them, which in my case is time and in some other people's case it might be recognizing faces or what not. Or crossing the street.\u00a0 You could decide to really always cross at lights, or when there are no cars.\u00a0 You could live in a neighborhood with either very busy streets (to ensure lights) or non busy streets (to reduce likelihood of cars) if that was your lifestyle.\u00a0 Things can be worked around. \n \nIf you are an Autistic self who is trying to find workarounds for your self you can ask trusted friends to help you make a list of things you are good at, in case the topic is stressing you out. They might be able to see connections that will cause you to come up with excellent workarounds together that would not have been thought of alone. \n \nSome friends and I have a whole website called  We Are Like Your Child  which is largely devoted to workarounds, but also partially just to showing that we who have pretty insurmountable sounding problems are willing to go out on a limb to talk about them now because we get the message that the successes we have fought for make our lives seem unattainable to some people, on behalf of their children, who are having a hard time now. But we were like that, and we wanted people to know.\u00a0 The link takes you to an essay of mine because I know I wrote an essay specifically about workarounds for the social and sensory issues surrounding why it is so hard to go to a party.\u00a0 I know if you click around there on that site there are other great workarounds mentioned like ways to organize. \n \nEverybody, I want to thank you.\u00a0 This has been great. I hope more people will ask questions like this and I also hope more and more people will share their own experiences in the comments because our experiences are different and similar and all very telling.\u00a0 Experience is the richest place to find questions and answers and it also makes our community strong. \n \nLove, \nIb \n \nO & PS So this is my invitation to put your favorite workaround into the comments below!! :D\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tinygracenotes.com/2013/09/crossing-street-with-neither-guard-nor.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-enjt2dvCVUw/Ukr8vPEZnKI/AAAAAAAAAUY/IpLBO0orBVw/s1600/workaround_200x200.jpg", "http://www.tinygracenotes.com/2012/10/labels-also-intense-teaching-is-realer.html", "http://www.tinygracenotes.com/2012/11/autism-and-time-agnosia.html", "http://itsbridgetsword.wordpress.com/", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autism-timer/id409539780?mt=8", "http://wearelikeyourchild.blogspot.com/2013/08/socio-sensory-distress-is-harsh-but.html"], "link": "http://tinygracenotes.blogspot.com/2013/10/workarounds-are-your-friend.html", "title": "\nWorkarounds Are Our Friend\n"},

If you click on the link, you can join us in the virtual vigil group on Facebook. Please do. \n \nWe come together today to mourn those who are gone from us. They cannot be brought back, but they will never be forgotten. \n \nWhile the issue is complex, I know it is something many more fear, whose loved ones are not gone, but might become gone; and if this is you, or someone else you know, I invite you to consider reading a  post I wrote on the topic last June.  It may have no application, or it might. \n \nMy heart goes out to the families and friends of those we have lost. \n \n \n \n \n[Pic of a candle in cupped hands, in the dark.
