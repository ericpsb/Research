Image \u00a9 2017, Max Sparrow] Like most (all?) humans, I am greatly enriched by any and all support during this intense time of great change. And I am blessed to have so much support and so much love from others. I want to talk about layers and intensities of friendship and love from my Autistic perspective. This is just me \u2014 other Autists might be different, so don\u2019t assume that I\u2019m telling you some kind of universal Autistic thing. \u00a0Take my experience as a first step in asking questions and working to understand yourself or the Autists in your life. The phrase \u201cinner circle\u201d has a lot of meaning to me because I have a small but very important inner circle. My inner circle consists of one or two people with whom I am engaging in a deeply intimate and trusting manner. I seem mainly to only be able to hold one person in my inner circle at a time, although for the last couple of months I was holding two people in there. It was very difficult and I found myself feeling like I was oscillating between the two people in my inner circle. I credit (whether accurately or not) my Autistic neurology for my very small inner circle. I have tried to expand my inner circle and I just can\u2019t. This is the place where a best friend and/or a lover fits into my life. While I admire polyamory, I have not been able to engage in polyamory myself because trying to fit more than one person into my inner circle causes struggle. Trying to fit more than two people into my inner circle causes tragic implosion. It might be possible, but it turns out to be highly ill-advised for me. Growing up, I wasn\u2019t even able to hold both my mother and my father in my inner circle at the same time. Because my most inner circle of friendship is this tiny demitasse cup, most of my life my best friend, mentor, and closest confidant has also been my lover. \u00a0This is dangerous. The saying is \u201cdon\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket.\u201d Problems arise when everything is poured into one person. There is so much opportunity for abuse (in either direction). It is more likely that too many of my needs will get heaped on the one person who will get burned out as a result. If that one person withdraws their presence from my inner circle, the vacuum they leave behind can be devastating. There is another difficulty that comes from having a demitasse inner circle. \u00a0I have noticed a pattern. There is a type of person who understands how to climb right into my demitasse \u2014 even, sometimes, to the point of displacing someone else who actually belongs in there \u2014 almost immediately. \u00a0Once in there, they enjoy all kinds of fun and games at my expense (and usually to my great confusion and consternation as well) and then either they lose interest and drop me cold (leaving me to suffer that vacuum of the sudden absence of a person who I had allowed in to the most inner chamber of my being) or I begin to awaken to the toxic nature of what I have been allowing to happen and I evict them myself. (I\u2019ve also had people inexpertly try to break down the door to my inner circle but get held at arm\u2019s length due to their clumsy attempts to manipulate me being so obvious. \u00a0This sort gets angry and bludgeons me in some way for refusing to allow them entry. The last person who did this to me ended up sending the police to my door because I didn\u2019t answer their text for 45 minutes.) I try to be an open person. There is risk there. People slip in to greater intimacy than I should be allowing them. \u00a0Some of them use or hurt me. I am learning how to guard against that. There is also great risk in being a closed person. \u00a0If I let no one in, I impoverish myself. \u00a0Human contact is important to me. \u00a0One big reason I adopted a nomadic lifestyle was so that I could expand my world by meeting more people. I have other levels of friendship. The next level is is pretty big and I have a lot of people in there. Some of them I don\u2019t talk to for weeks or months at a time but when we connect again we pick up the conversation as if only a moment had passed since the last things we said to one another. These are people I love deeply and am deeply grateful for. Then there is a huge swath of acquaintanceship with a great many people with whom I have limited interactions. \u00a0They are people I admire and respect but we have a connection that I consider to be more \u201csurface\u201d (athough, compared to how I see friendship discussed by others, I suspect my \u201csurface\u201d is still pretty \u201cdeep\u201d for most people. \u00a0I credit Autistic neurology for this, too. We don\u2019t tend to do chit-chat.) But that innermost level\u2026.I have not made the best choices about who I allow in there. \u00a0I have accidentally ended up with someone marvelous in there, and been very grateful. \u00a0And I have accidentally ended up with someone destructive in there. \u00a0Sadly, the latter has happened more often than the former. I have been doing a lot of thinking lately about my inner circle and how vulnerable this model of relating can make me. Times when I\u2019ve had no one in my inner circle have been bleak and desolate. But I\u2019ve been wondering whether that is necessary. It certainly isn\u2019t desirable. And what I\u2019ve been thinking about most is this: Can I be in my own inner circle? And I think that question is key to a personal breakthrough. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/friendship-support-and-my-inner-circle/", "title": "Friendship, Support, and My Inner Circle"},

Committed? Killed? Meltdowns, Like Shutdowns, Are Harmful But Necessary We Autistic adults and teens put a lot of energy into figuring out what will lead to a meltdown and working to avoid those things whenever possible. \u00a0Parents of younger Autistics also put a lot of energy and work into figuring these things out, both to try to keep triggering events out of their child\u2019s life and to try to help their child learn how to recognize and steer around those triggers themselves. Outsiders who don\u2019t understand will accuse us of being overly avoidance and self-indulgent and accuse our parents of spoiling and coddling us. I have written about how  shutdown can alter brain function  in unwanted ways. \u00a0Meltdowns also have their dangers and can alter brain function over time. \u00a0A meltdown is an extreme stress reaction and  chronic stress can damage brain structure and connectivity . But meltdowns serve a purpose, just as another unpleasant experience that can also re-wire the brain if it continues chronically and unabated \u2014 pain \u2014 also serves an important and very necessary purpose. Pain is an alarm system that helps us avoid bodily damage and urges us to try to change something to protect our body. While pain is usually unwanted and something we seek to avoid, without pain we would not live very long because we would not have such a strong drive to eliminate sources of damage to our bodies. Meltdowns are alarm systems to protect our brains. That idea is so important I gave it its own paragraph. \u00a0And I\u2019ll say it again: without meltdowns, we would have nothing to protect our neurology from the very real damage that it can accumulate. So often, I see researchers and other writers talking about meltdowns as if they were a malfunction or manifestation of damage. \u00a0I strongly disagree. \u00a0It is easy for someone outside of us to view a meltdown that way because they see an unpleasant outburst that makes their lives more unpleasant or difficult to be around. \u00a0They see someone who appears to be over-reacting to something that\u2019s not such a big deal as all that. \u00a0They see someone immature who needs to grow up, snap out of it, or get a \u201cgood spanking\u201d \u00a0to teach them to behave. When someone doesn\u2019t experience the hell it is to be the person having the meltdowns, they can easily misunderstand and misjudge what it actually happening. Meltdowns Are A Normal Response To Sensitivities Let me ask you something: \u00a0this is a thought experiment and you don\u2019t have to actually do this, but you might understand better if you actually follow along physically. \u00a0Take your finger and poke the softer flesh on the inside of your thigh with it so that you are pressing the tip of your fingernail into your thigh. \u00a0Don\u2019t actually damage yourself! You\u2019re just looking for a reference sensation. \u00a0Poke it about as hard as you might press a button to ring someone\u2019s doorbell. If you have long, sharp fingernails that might have hurt a little bit (I hope you were careful. \u00a0The goal here is not to injure yourself \u2014 just to create a physical sensation.) \u00a0It was a quick poke, so it probably didn\u2019t even leave a mark behind, no matter how long your fingernails are. Now do the same thing to your gums, either above or below your teeth, in that area between your teeth and the inside of your lips. \u00a0Oh! You couldn\u2019t even poke it as hard, could you? \u00a0Do be gentle with your gums, please. \u00a0I repeat, this is not about harming yourself. \u00a0You don\u2019t even have to poke yourself at all if you don\u2019t want to. \u00a0You know your thighs and gums. \u00a0You know without lifting a finger that I am telling you the truth when I say your gums are much more sensitive than your inner thigh. And you are not \u201cover-reacting\u201d \u00a0when you have more pain response in your gums than in your thigh, right? \u00a0It\u2019s easier to hurt your gums so your reaction to the same stimulus is much more intense when it is applied to your gum than to your thigh. \u00a0You are not self-indulgent or spoiled. \u00a0You don\u2019t need a good spanking to get over how sensitive your gums are. \u00a0You just need to take extra care that things don\u2019t poke you in the gums. So what\u2019s my point? \u00a0If you are not Autistic \u2014 and even more so if you are pretty close to neurotypical \u2014 your neurological wiring is more like your thigh. \u00a0Life pokes at you a lot and you don\u2019t even notice it. \u00a0Much of life\u2019s poking is fun for you. \u00a0Some pokes are less recreational but present satisfying challenges. \u00a0So when you see an Autistic person having a meltdown you might not even recognize the pokes they have been processing all day long because you don\u2019t even feel them. But our Autistic neurological wiring is more like your gums. \u00a0Except not even that predictable. \u00a0Some of our senses may be \u201chyporesponsive\u201d \u00a0and we need to stimulate them to be aware that they are even functioning. \u00a0Some of us spin around or pace in circles. \u00a0Some of us move our hands or fingers in ways that make us feel better. \u00a0Some of us blast loud music with a heavy bass and drum component to it. \u00a0Some of us rock back and forth. \u00a0Our wiring demands more input than the world\u2019s regular pokes can give us. Some of our senses are \u201chyperresponsive\u201d \u00a0and we need much less stimulation. \u00a0Life\u2019s pokes are like fingernails grinding into our gums and we need to make it stop because we cannot bear the pain. \u00a0Loud sounds or high-pitched sounds get to some of us. \u00a0Others are overwhelmed by the struggle to understand speech when more than one person is talking at the same time. \u00a0Some can\u2019t stand textures of fabrics or foods. Most people I know are a complex mixture of hyporesponsiveness and hyperresponsiveness. \u00a0Most people I know have some senses that are both hypo and hyper responsive, changing over time. \u00a0I can\u2019t give you any single idea of a sensory pattern for an Autistic neurology because we each have our own combinations of needs. Normal Human Variation Includes Variant Emotional Sensitivity Levels But when it comes to meltdowns, it\u2019s not just sensory input (or lack thereof) that will set off an Autistic\u2019s neurological warning system and throw us into meltdown. \u00a0What inspired me to write about this topic today was reading something I had written a year ago. \u00a0I spent a few months living in an emotionally abusive situation last year. \u00a0The man I was living with for a brief time figured out very quickly how to manipulate my compliance triggers. \u00a0He even commented specifically on how easy it was for him to physically subdue me once he spotted the compliance \u201cfish-hooks\u201d \u00a0that childhood had left embedded in me. I\u2019m not going to go into much detail about what he did for the same reason that I shy away from going into much detail about my decade of childhood therapy. \u00a0I am working on removing those hooks from my flesh. \u00a0The last thing I want to do is instruct others as to where those hooks are embedded and how to use them to steer me like a puppet. My point in mentioning the incident at all is that I realized after the fact that my meltdowns had been sending me a very clear message I should have heeded immediately. \u00a0Instead, I did what I always do: I interpreted my meltdowns as a sign of how damaged I was and how much I needed help to gain self-control. Most of my life, I\u2019ve allowed lovers to convince me to try to medicate my meltdowns into submission. \u00a0I have hated them because they seemed to illustrate how flawed and awful I was. \u00a0My thought process went like this: I melt down because I\u2019m Autistic and meltdowns are frightening and horrible and who would want to be my romantic partner? I can\u2019t blame people for treating me badly and wanting to get away from me because look at these meltdowns! My experience last year helped me to finally realize that I was looking at things backwards. I don\u2019t melt down because I\u2019m Autistic. I melt down because something in my environment is intolerable and I am having a normal reaction of pain and/or anxiety. \u00a0That pain can be from something physical, like an intolerable temperature in the room or a sound that is piercing my eardrums and making me nauseated. \u00a0Or it can be something emotional, like internal feelings of frustration or external abuse. Everyone has meltdowns. \u00a0It\u2019s not just an Autistic thing. \u00a0But our wiring is different, just like the wiring is different between your thighs and your gums. \u00a0Some things that make neurotypicals meltdown don\u2019t bother me. \u00a0A whole heaping lot of things that don\u2019t bother neurotypicals make me meltdown terribly. \u00a0I\u2019m not deficient in some way; I\u2019m \u00a0wired differently. Meltdowns Protect Us From Harmful Situations And People One of the things I learned last year is that even when I can\u2019t recognize abuse because  I have alexithymia , even when I can\u2019t recognize abuse because my compliance training is kicking in full force, my body and nervous system will send me the message with repeated meltdowns. What I wrote a year ago: If I have lots of shouting, freak-out, PTSD meltdowns when we spend time alone with each other, yes it\u2019s an Autistic thing. But it also means you\u2019re regularly doing something messed up. \n An isolated meltdown could just be a random convergence of awful that has nothing to do with you, but if a pattern develops, you\u2019re probably gaslighting me, mistreating me, abusing me, or generally taking nastily unfair advantage of that same autistic neurology that makes me unable to recogni ze I\u2019m being abused or mistreated until I see the pattern of meltdowns. \n All my life I\u2019ve been told, and believed, that losing my shit was a personal shortcoming I should work to overcome. \n I now realize it\u2019s actually my body/brain\u2019s alarm system letting me know something\u2019s seriously wrong in my life. Something bad that needs to be fixed, like yesterday, if not sooner. \n I finally realized all this today. Everything suddenly connected. \n And in an instant, I no longer hate my meltdowns. I think I might actually love them. They protect me. \n So\u2026 I still do hate meltdowns. \u00a0More specifically, I hate having meltdowns. \u00a0They are hard on me, physically and emotionally. \u00a0They are embarrassing, messy, frightening. \n But I am grateful that my body has a way to tell me when I\u2019m in a bad situation, even if my mind is not capable of figuring it out yet. \u00a0I vow to respect and honor my meltdowns. \u00a0This is not the same as excusing my behavior. \u00a0This is not the same as giving myself free reign to do whatever, whenever. \n I still want to do whatever I can to avoid having a meltdown. \u00a0I still want to work on my ability to detect a meltdown on the horizon and remove myself to safety before things go too far. \n But I also vow to listen to my meltdowns and pay closer attention to my triggers. \u00a0Meltdowns teach me what my nervous system can handle and what is too much for me. \u00a0Meltdowns teach me how to take care of myself. \u00a0Meltdowns teach me what my nervous system needs. \u00a0Meltdowns highlight areas of my life that are not on track. \n Sometimes my depression shows me that something is wrong in my life but sometimes depression is just like a wildfire, burning out of control. \u00a0The same with anxiety. \u00a0But I have learned that meltdowns are always highlighting something I need to address. \n Meltdowns protect me. \u00a0Some aspects of my neurology make me more vulnerable. \u00a0Some remnants of childhood experiences leave me more vulnerable. \u00a0Meltdowns fill that gap and send me messages about my life that can help me protect myself. \n While I will never enjoy  having  a meltdown, I promise I will always value the protective gift meltdowns bring me. \n \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/the-protective-gift-of-meltdowns/", "title": "The Protective Gift of Meltdowns"},

Natchitoches house from  Steel Magnolias alligator feeding show There was nothing remarkable about the day. \u00a0The weather seemed fine, if extremely humid. \u00a0Sunset was due in about 20 minutes. I was reading a novel about the mother of an Autistic boy (I\u2019ll be reviewing that soon on Thinking Person\u2019s Guide to Autism) when my weather app, Dark Sky, flashed an alert on my screen, letting me know that heavy rain was coming in ten minutes. I had a couple of quick chores I needed to do that were unpleasant in the rain, so I quickly did them: I filled my water jugs and emptied my trash, including cleaning the cat box, thinking how nice it would be when the rain came and cooled everything off a little. \u00a0I was parked on the east side of the Walmart and when I took the trash to a trash can, I could see past the store to the western sky which was dark grey with a huge wall cloud filling the sky. I returned to the minivan and the bulk of the Walmart hid the western sky from my sight once more. \u00a0The rain started almost right away. \u00a0I congratulated myself for getting everything done in time to stay dry. My self-congratulatory mood didn\u2019t last long. The rain came down so hard that the parking lot was filled with inches of standing water. \u00a0Heavy winds began bringing wave after wave of water rushing toward me. \u00a0The van began to rock with the impact of the wind. \u00a0I decided to check my weather app to get a better idea of the storm\u2019s intensity and expected duration. \u00a0What I saw chilled me. Tornado Warning \u2013 funnel sighted, take cover immediately. If you are in a vehicle, leave and seek shelter right away. I quickly typed \u201cShit. Tornado warning.\u201d on Facebook, thinking if the worst occurred, at least my friends would know why I had disappeared. Because I travel and spend so much time away from anyone I know, I regularly take measures to enable those who love me to help find me if something should go terribly awry. I had to act fast. I quickly debated whether to bring my cat or not and decided to leave him. \u00a0His smaller mass would protect him a little if the van went tumbling and taking him out into that solid wall of rain would not go well. He would have immediately clawed his way free and probably gone under the van. I wished him luck as I grabbed my phone, keys, and the festival pack I keep my money and identification in. I didn\u2019t wait long enough to cram my keys and phone in the pack \u2014 I just opened the door and slipped out, locking it behind me. The rain was pounding and thick. \u00a0The wind was coming from the west, so I didn\u2019t feel the full force right away because the building blocked some of it. But as I ran toward the Walmart, the wind lifted the two tables in the employee break shelter beside the building. \u00a0Even with the building blocking the wind, it was powerful enough to pick up those two tables and send them hurtling straight toward me. I watched it speed toward me, a wall of certain death aimed right at my torso and head. I tried to move aside but the wind was so fierce it was like a solid object, unyielding. At the last possible moment, a side gust of wind knocked me off my feet and turned the table into a curve ball, sending it veering off to the south. I scrambled, half-crawling, toward the building. The wind was too forceful to get past the edge of the building to the door. All the parking lot lights flickered and went out. I took advantage of a niche in the architecture where two walls came together and pressed myself into that corner, watching tree branches and other large, unidentifiable objects go flying past the building. I had lost a shoe when I fell. Worse, I had dropped my keys. I scanned the ground in front of me as best I could through the storm but all I could see was wind-tossed debris. I knew I couldn\u2019t go back out into the full force of the storm to look for my keys. All I could do was hope they couldn\u2019t get blown into the next Parish before the storm ended. My immediate survival seemed more important than my keys, even though I had no idea how I would get back into my minivan \u2014 my home \u2014 without my keys. I have no idea how long I stood there, squeezed into that niche. \u00a0I took off my glasses, made useless by the rain, and tucked them in the pack. I typed some words of update on Facebook, then tucked my phone in there, too. \u00a0With everything secured, I made another attempt for the front of the building and succeeded this time. With the power out, the sliding doors wouldn\u2019t open! I was now out in the full force of the storm and stuck outside! I continued past the second door to take cover in the corner between the glass doors and the brick wall, a smaller niche but still some shield against the projectiles flying through the air. A powerline directly over my head whipped back and forth ominously and I hoped it wouldn\u2019t break loose and come down on me with a shower of sparks. It held. Debris continued to fly past me, mere inches from my face now. Having nothing else to do but wait, I typed more updates on Facebook so people would know I was still alive. The people inside the Walmart forced the sliding doors open behind me and the wind pushed me inside the building. Once inside, my nerves finally caught up with me. Everything had been too immediate to feel fear, anxiety, or panic while outside. Now my body trembled. The people inside seemed not to understand what it had been like, being stuck outside the building. I was counseled to never worry because Jesus is always watching out for me. \u00a0\u201cWell, eventually he will call me home,\u201d I responded. \u201cI\u2019d prefer that weren\u2019t today.\u201d While we waited for the storm to pass, everyone\u2019s phone suddenly sounded an alert. I looked at mine and it warned of flash flooding. Knowing we were right on the river, I asked if the Walmart were on high ground and \u00a0was reassured by many that the river would take days to rise high enough to reach us. Finally the wind died down. I had to ask several Walmart employees before I found one willing to get a flashlight and help me look for my keys. He offered an umbrella but I was still dripping wet so I didn\u2019t bother. Out we went into the rain, with lightning flashes so bright they briefly lit the parking lot as bright as day. I found my shoe first, which surprised me because I didn\u2019t expect to find it at all. \u00a0The employee found my keys and I was so relieved I hugged him in gratitude. My van has some new dents and scratches from the shopping carts that were flung into it, but no windows or lights were broken, the solar panels stayed tight, the cargo carrier resisted the storm. Mr. Kitty gave me the \u201cyou\u2019re back from the dangerous expedition!\u201d meows, but quickly calmed down and set to his favorite hobby, eating. I counted six trees uprooted around the edges of the parking lot, massive roots exposed to the air. Reports say the funnel cloud touched down about a mile past where I was. My research suggests this was the fourth tornado this town has seen in 2017, unless I missed one. The storm system was huge, stretching along the entire western half of the U.S. Gulf Coast. Only one person was killed. Weather Underground tells me the wind was 60 miles per hour at the peak of the storm. \u00a0For an idea of what that looks like, here\u2019s a short video of a 60 mile per hour storm from about 6 years ago: The storm I lived through Sunday night was a 10 on the 12-point  Beaufort Wind Force Scale , also known as a whole gale. At sea, it would have created 30 to 40 foot waves. A hurricane, ranked 12 on the scale, comes with winds above 73 miles per hour. Today I am grateful to be alive and more respectful of the power of sudden storms than ever before. I have lived through a few tornadoes, but always inside a solid house, never outside. Winds that high are like a solid mass with an irresistible force. \u00a0My life was at risk, but the wind also saved my life when it picked me up off the ground and dropped me, just in time to miss getting hit by those tables that whisked past my head. I have talked before about how calm I can be in a true crisis. My autistic neurology sends me into a panic when little things go wrong, but every time I have been in a genuine crisis situation, I have been the calmest person on the scene, guiding people who are standing frozen in their tracks to call for an ambulance, enacting or instructing others in emergency first aid for injured people, putting out fires, finding that one elusive, clever way out of the path of disaster bearing down. When seconds count, I tend to think fast and fall apart later. I have talked to other Autistics who express similar wiring and related experiences. It\u2019s strange to think that so many of us are people who might get so upset we melt into an emotional puddle because someone ate the last of the breakfast cereal while we were asleep yet when quick thinking matters, we rush forward to save ourselves or others. My Sunday night could have been a lot worse than it was. But when I think back over it all, I am pleased with my choices. I didn\u2019t see anything I recognized as alarming about the sky \u2014 now I have a better idea of what a wall\u00a0cloud (something I had never seen before) can bring. I am used to the sky turning green before a tornado, but my previous tornadoes were all in Kentucky. Weather is a bit different down here, it seems. Overall, I made fast, good decisions under pressure. May I never experience sudden severe weather again. But if/when I do, I feel much more confident about my ability to spring to action when the going really gets rough.

By now, most of you probably know why people are making that choice, but just yesterday I saw a lot of people arguing about the topic, so I think we still need to make it clear. Autism awareness, in and of itself, is not inherently bad. By now, most people are aware that there is a thing called autism but, in my experience, most people are not very aware of what that autism thing actually is. So I do, at least partially, agree with the people who say we still need more awareness. What I have a problem with is the form that awareness tends to take. A week ago, I had to stop listening to the radio because all the stations were already gearing up for April with lots of \u201cawareness\u201d and lots of advertisements about awareness events. I heard a lot about children with autism and nothing at all about Autistic adults. Not only do we \u201cage out\u201d of most services when we turn 18, but we also become invisible. It\u2019s as if the entire world stops caring about us once we are no longer cute children to worry about and, instead, inconvenient adults to be stuck with. I heard a lot of scare talk, including hearing us repeatedly compared to diabetes, cancer and AIDS. Diabetes, cancer and AIDS kill children. Autism does not. Diabetes, cancer and AIDS are illnesses laid on top of a child\u2019s underlying identity \u2014 they can change a child\u2019s philosophy but they do not change innate aspects of their identity. Autism is a cognitive and perceptual difference that is so deeply rooted in our neurology that it cannot be separated from our identity. Beneath cancer, there is a healthy child hoping to break free. Beneath autism, there is more autism \u2014 it\u2019s autism all the way to the core. Autistic children do not \u201cgo into remission,\u201d they develop coping skills and they mature into Autistic adults, and they work to learn ways to communicate with those around them. There might be suffering that can be alleviated \u2014 seizures brought under control, gastrointestinal disorders treated, methods learned\u00a0and sometimes medications taken\u00a0for mitigating anxiety. Autistic adults often do not resemble the Autistic children they once were \u2014 we grow and develop all our lives \u2014 but Autistic adults are still every bit as Autistic as they were when they were children, no matter how many coping skills are learned, no matter how \u201cindistinguishable from their peers\u201d they become. At the center of the autism awareness movement is an organization known as Autism Speaks that functions like a giant magnet, drawing all donations to them.\u00a0In the ten years that Autism Speaks has been around, local organizations have watched their funding dry up. Autism Speaks dominates the autism charity scene now and, as a result, they have the power to set the tone when it comes to \u201cawareness.\u201d And that tone is one of despair and misery. We are portrayed as burdens who break up marriages and destroy the lives of those around us. We have been compared to \u201clepers\u201d (an outdated term for people with Hansen\u2019s disease) and our parents to saints for taking care of us. The awareness that is being put forth is shaped around a rhetoric of fear. Autism Speaks is one of the few organizations that is widely hated by the population it was established to serve. Only one Autistic person was ever accepted in a leadership role and  he resigned, saying , \u201cNo one says the Cancer Society does not speak for them.\u00a0 No one describes the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation as an evil organization.\u00a0 All that and more is said of Autism Speaks every day.\u00a0 I\u2019ve tried to be a voice of moderation but it hasn\u2019t worked. Too many of the views expressed by the organization are not my own; indeed I hold very different points of view.\u201d So that is autism awareness. That is what we are rejecting. What is autism acceptance? Autism acceptance is seeing us as whole, complete human beings worthy of respect. Autism acceptance is recognizing that we are different and helping us learn to work within our individual patterns of strengths and weaknesses to become the best people we can be, not trying to transform us into someone we are not. Autism acceptance is remembering always that Autistic people are listening, including those who might appear not to be, and choosing to speak of autism and Autistic people in ways that presume competence and communicate value. \u201cTolerance says, \u201cWell, I have to put up with you.\u201d Awareness says, \u201cI know you have a problem and are working earnestly to fix it.\u201d  Acceptance  says, \u201cYou are amazing because you are you, and not despite your differences, but because of them.\u201d\u201d \u2013  Kassiane Sibley \u201cAcceptance is about recognizing that an autistic person is, and will always be, different but not less \u2014 even as some challenges are addressed.\u00a0\u201d \u2013  Amy Sequenzia \u201cAutistic people are not viewed as able beings, this view makes us suffer.\u201d \u2013  Emma Zurcher-Long \u201cAutism Acceptance means supporting the Autistic person in learning the things they want to learn and in gaining the skills they need for what they want to do. Autism Acceptance is the radical assertion that at the level of broad, overarching principles, what Autistic people need isn\u2019t that different. We need to be accepted for who we are. We need to hear that we\u2019re OK, we need to hear that the things we have trouble with don\u2019t make us broken or lazy or horrible people. We need people\u2019s actions towards us to reflect that. We need people to listen when we say we need help, and we need people to listen when we say we don\u2019t. We need to be taken as the whole people that we are, and we need to be met with the understanding that we are the experts in our own lives and abilities.\u201d \u2013  Alyssa \u201cGood teaching is based in deep respect for the individual, the cognitive learning style of each student, the shared excitement about the topic of study. Best practice in teaching autistic students isn\u2019t any different, though these faculty would be insulted if I told them so.\u201d \u2013  Carolyn Ogburn \u201cOver the past two years, I have asked Tyler many times how he feels about having autism. And while he clearly understands how the autism negatively affects his social skills and attention, he always tells me that he likes his autism. Although he has also told me, at times, that he wants to be \u201cnormal,\u201d he continues to insist that his autism helps him. So if he likes his autism, do I really have the right to counsel him otherwise?\u201d \u2013  Kymberly Grosso \u201cIf you have the autism acceptance song in your heart, add Paula and Est\u00e9e\u2019s voices to your blog rolls, Subscribe to their blogs. Tweet, \u2018like\u2019, and show your respect and support to these powerful women. Don\u2019t allow their names to fade into internet oblivion as others try to opt into autism acceptance because it is now the fashion. They were doing it before it was cool. It is easier to say accept autism now because others paid the high cost for daring to say it before us.\u201d \u2013  Kerima \u00c7evik \u201c Acceptance \u00a0means accepting yourself as you are, even in the face of persistent attempts throughout your life to get you to be what you are not. Especially in the face of persistent attempts throughout your life to get you to be what you are not. The best you can be is Autistic. Let me explain. \u201cThe best you can be is Autistic\u201d means that you are at your best when you are being fully who you are, able to express yourself and move through the world in ways that are right for you, comfortable for your body. \u201cThe best you can be is Autistic\u201d does not imply impairments, \u201cless than,\u201d \u201ccan only do so much.\u201d On the contrary, it means that you are who you are- your pervasive Autistic self (which actually includes those parts that observers might think are \u201ctypical\u201d just because they can\u2019t see anything that looks unusual to them), and that encompasses  all  of who you are, not just the parts that have been \u201cpermitted,\u201d and not just the stuff that whatever the DSM of the moment says are your deficits. \u201cYou have the right,  or should , to grow in ways that are good for you, that  you  think are good for you. You have the right to make changes in your life that  you  think are the correct ones for you.\u201d \u2013  Paula C.

Also Check out Corina Becker\u2019s  Open Letter to Temple Grandin . -=- I want to talk about what it\u2019s like being a multiply-disabled Autistic who can\u2019t get/keep traditional employment and meeting Temple Grandin. This is not easy to do because Grandin is such a public figure. \u00a0For many people, Temple Grandin is the only non-fiction autistic adult they have ever heard of. \u00a0I don\u2019t want to deal with how I would feel if I tried to count or even estimate the number of times someone has said to me: \u201cOh, you\u2019re autistic? That\u2019s very interesting. \u00a0Have you ever heard of Temple Grandin?\u201d \n \u2013 random clueless people everywhere always As if it\u00a0were possible to be an Autistic adult and not have heard of\u00a0her. Before I tell you what it was like to meet Dr. Grandin, however, I have to give you some context. \u00a0First we need to talk about one of my other disabilities, hypernychthemeral syndrome, a.k.a. Non-24-hour Sleep-Wake Syndrome or just Non-24 for short. Please don\u2019t just skip over this part. \u00a0Understanding my non-24 is essential to understanding this story overall. -=- I was born with a circadian rhythm disorder called Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder\u00a0or DSPD. \u00a0 My case was pretty severe. \u00a0By the time I was old enough to work, I was waking up at sunset and sleeping at sunrise. \u00a0So I worked night jobs, but I couldn\u2019t keep them. \u00a0I could interview my way in the door because I can hold it together for 30 minutes to seem \u2026. together enough to work at that bar or restaurant, I guess. \u00a0I don\u2019t know. \u00a0But once I was actually working there every day I\u00a0couldn\u2019t keep up appearances full-time (because, as Albert Camus so aptly put it: \n \u201cNobody realizes that some people \nexpend tremendous energy \nmerely to be normal.\u201d \n -Albert Camus \n I suffered a lot during those years. \u00a0I spent a lot of time homeless. \u00a0I spent a lot of time living or working in places that were not the healthiest places I could have been if I\u2019d had more options in life. I finally decided to try academia. \u00a0I\u2019d gotten it into my head that college would be different. \u00a0I probably got the idea from all those people who tried (unsuccessfully) to prevent me from dropping out of high school by dangling college as a carrot. \u00a0\u201cCollege will be different. \u00a0People are too focused on what they\u2019re doing to bother with bullying you. \u00a0You can get really deeply into a topic and people will admire you for it, unlike high school where they beat you down for it.\u201d It was a nice dream. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t true. \u00a0The bullying was just as bad in college. \u00a0It got even worse in graduate school. \u00a0Academia was not my solution, but I was learning a lot about self-regulation and coping, so I just kept pushing through, hoping I\u2019d be able to figure out the social muddle eventually. -=- Except the struggle to get a degree while still living with extreme DSPD ended up creating a situation that was sort of accidental chronotherapy. \u00a0James S.P. Fadden wrote about the danger of chronotherapy to those with severe DSPD in his article \u201c What You Need to Know About Non-24 ,\u201d saying \u201cNon-24 also may result from attempts to treat another circadian disorder, Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS), using chronotherapy, in which patients are instructed to gradually delay their sleep time until they go around the clock to a more socially acceptable schedule.\u201d And Fadden is pretty clear about the reasons one would want to avoid developing Non-24. \u00a0He writes: The impact of non-24 on the lives of affected patients, both blind and sighted, is considerable. It has been described as \u201cextremely debilitating in that it is incompatible with most social and professional obligations.\u201d \n -James S.P. Fadden, quoting Dr. Oren and Dr. Wehr, writing in the  New England Journal of Medicine . So this is the thing I live with now, this Non-24, and it makes it impossible to support myself by working inside a building or for most employers. -=- Award-winning author George Dawes Green  has non-24 . \u00a0He just goes with it. \u00a0There are treatments, but they don\u2019t work very well in severe cases and even when they do work, they require an incredible amount of self-discipline and time-regulation. \u00a0I did it for a while. \u00a0It was expensive and tedious and entrainment was as fragile as a sculpture constructed from tobacco ash. \u00a0 I have also let myself go free-running like Green and can definitely see why he went with his choice, especially if his rhythm is very regular and predictable. \u00a0Mine used to be when I was younger. \u00a0Now it\u2019s harder to predict and my sleep/wake drive is so rigid and ossifying more all the time as I age. Fadden, on the other hand, points out that some people with non-24 prefer the \u201cinconvenience\u201d \u00a0of the treatments to free-running. \u00a0This is also true and I would fall into this camp if it were possible for me to actually have a life while adhering to therapy. \u00a0I found it impossible to succeed in graduate school while adhering to the strict therapy regimen required to keep my non-24 in check. I couldn\u2019t live my life on the therapy and I have no desire to maintain the therapy if I\u2019m not trying to fit in to the schedule required to maintain traditional employment and social connections. \u00a0Being unemployed and living on disability is bad enough already without adding a draconian schedule of light and dark all the time. Dawes understands the trade-off, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s never easy. There is always that sense (that) if only I had a regular schedule, I could get so much more done. But I couldn\u2019t be as creative. When I let myself go free \u2014 going to sleep when I want \u2014 then creativity surges through me.\u201d This reminds me so much of what bipolar friends have said when explaining why they don\u2019t take medication, preferring instead to work with their body\u2019s rhythms and honor their own process. But free-running like George Dawes Green doesn\u2019t resolve the strong metabolic issues that come along with my non-24. \u00a0My suspicion, though I\u2019ve never been tested sufficiently to prove it, is that my internal clocks are still desynchronized even when I\u2019m sleeping and waking at my body\u2019s request when free-running while living indoors. \u00a0I need very bright sunlight to bring my body into synchrony. -=- My solution has come about through rather unconventional means. \u00a0I manage my non-24 by living in my minivan. \u00a0I consider this a valid medical approach to managing my non-24, every bit as much as injecting insulin and eating a ketogenic diet is a valid approach to managing my diabetes. \u00a0The longer I live in my minivan (it will be two years on May 25th) the more I realize that I have finally found the only workable solution for me. I got the idea to move into the minivan around the same time as the conversation with Temple Grandin that I am working my way toward telling you about. \u00a0Maybe a year\u00a0after meeting Dr. Grandin, I was taking an excellent class in circadian biology from Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen\u00a0through Coursera. The course, taught by \u00a0Dr. Roenneberg and Dr. Merrow, was called\u00a0 Circadian Clocks: How Rhythms Structure Life . While taking that class, I learned about ongoing research at the University of Colorado in Boulder on camping and circadian rhythms. \u00a0Much of that work has been summarized in the recent article \u201c Can\u2019t Get to Sleep? Go Camping, Study Finds \u201c. \u00a0The first of the two studies included in the paper this article summarizes, was published in 2013. \u00a0That study sent people camping for a week in the summer and found that spending the day outside in the sun and the night in darkness with nothing brighter than a campfire to illuminate the night caused the campers \u2014 who had entered the study with a full range of non-clinical chronotypes \u2014 to entrain to the sun together. -=- Now that was an angle I hadn\u2019t considered! I was using a bank of therapy lights every day, ranging from several thousand lux to ten thousand lux. \u00a0Annoyingly bright. Painfully bright. \u00a0And useless unless I spent many hours in front of them every day. But being outside? Not only is the sun less painful for me than therapy lights (although still a lot to handle) but a sunny day provides over ten times as many lux of brightness as my strongest therapy light. \u00a0I spend a lot of time on the hottest days in the shade, with everything around me illuminated by the clear blue sky. \u00a0That\u2019s still twice as many lux\u00a0as my most powerful therapy light. It turns out that I sleep better when my nights are darker, but the most therapeutic thing for my non-24 (it varies from person to person, depending largely on the cause of their non-24) is to get enough very bright light in the daytime. \u00a0So I\u2019ve got to be outside every day. And that\u2019s when I first started seeing the logic of living in a van. \u00a0If I could find a vehicle with lots of windows, I could wake with the sun. \u00a0Whether I was inside or outside of my house, I\u2019d be getting lots of therapeutic light. And I could travel with the seasons, so I could continue to spend time safely living and sleeping outdoors year round. The Colorado researchers have conducted a second study that backs up the things I\u2019ve learned in the last two years of living in my Chrysler minivan \u2014 a cozy micro-tiny home of roughly 70 square feet. -=- If I might be indulged in a brief digression, I\u2019d like to tell you that I\u2019m writing this right now from my office. \u00a0I\u2019m sitting on my bed with one foot on the vintage wool carpet that covers my floor. \u00a0Mr. Kitty is sprawled beside me, sleeping peacefully, fang tips just peeking out from his slumbering smile. My tiny bluetooth speaker is filling the air with the best writing music I\u2019ve found in ages: the Galactic Caravan channel on Pandora. \u00a0The sun has reached the \u00a0nine a.m. point in the sky: not quite at 45 degrees from horizon this time of year. \u00a0Periodically, a gentle breeze comes through the slightly open window. \u00a0I\u2019m parked on a particularly appealing slant \u2014 it keeps my mousepad flat so my mouse doesn\u2019t keep sliding around \u2014 next to the gym where I will be showering when I finish writing this. \u00a0The weather is lovely. \u00a0Tomorrow is Easter \u2014 Eastern and Western coincide this year. \u00a0I\u2019m eating peanut butter chocolate  Keto Chow  for lunch. \u00a0Life is good. -=- One thing I have learned is that the winter sun is strong enough to keep me entrained as well. \u00a0This is what the Colorado researchers also found in their second study:\u00a0the winter sun is sufficiently\u00a0potent when it comes to sleep entrainment. Moreover, they found that camping for a weekend produced 69% of the circadian shift that the full week had produced in their earlier study. In my experience, the sun is necessary. \u00a0Fully overcast days only provide one or two thousand lux of light. \u00a0That\u2019s far weaker than the therapy lights I used to use. \u00a0And they barely worked. \u00a0So I lose my entrainment if there are too many overcast days in a row. And, over time, I\u2019ve figured out that my magic number is three. \u00a0Three days living indoors or in constantly rainy and overcast conditions will cause my body and sleep to desynchronize. \u00a0And three days out in the sun, living and sleeping outdoors in good weather sews everything back up again. The sun is so powerful that when I moved into my minivan full time on May 25th, 2015, I was at a phase in my sleep-wake cycle where I was only awake during darkness. \u00a0It would normally take me around two weeks of patient waiting and carefully monitoring therapeutic light and darkness conditions to swing from that to waking up at sunrise. I was waking at sunrise by May 28th, 2015. -=- Reporter Emily Laber-Warren had started studying my case in fall of 2014, to add color to her Scientific American Mind article about circadian rhythms and sleep. \u00a0She was still actively asking me questions to verify details when I was unfurling my natural therapy wings at that first campsite in Hemingway\u2019s fishing country, so she got to share my excitement at the shocking speed with which my body entrained to the sun. In her article,  Out of Sync , she wrote of me: Managing non-24 made it impossible to hold down a job, but Jones has a character, shaped in part by autism, that is fundamentally optimistic and animated by passionate, sustaining interests. After leaving graduate school, she self-published a book of personal essays and a CD of original music. Then she conceived a radical new life plan. Jones decided to give up her apartment in Pocatello, Idaho, and drive cross-country, becoming a modern-day nomad\u2014sleeping in a tent, indulging her love of nature, and visiting train yards, science museums and the graves of famous writers along the way. Her goal: to arrive on the East Coast to meet her love for the first time\u2014the person whose advice helped to stabilize her rhythms and with whom she has developed a long-distance romance. If things work out, she can settle close by; if not, she is mobile. \n But Jones had an additional motivation for pulling up stakes\u2014a theory that living outdoors, as our ancestors did for millions of years, experiencing the full force of the sun every day and true darkness at night, might cure her circadian disorder. \u201cIt would be pretty sweet if a primal hobo life does automatically what modern medicine struggles to accomplish,\u201d she wrote in an e-mail before her May departure. By June, when this article went to press, her rhythms seemed to be naturally and effortlessly stabilizing to a regular 8 a.m. wake-up time\u2014 but this progress disappeared whenever she visited friends and slept indoors. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that sleeping outdoors is such a radical \u2018therapy\u2019 that few will be able to replicate it,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbecause I am overjoyed with how well it is working for me.\u201d \n There is a lesson here for the rest of us, with our overextended, brightly lit, Starbucks-fueled lives. Modernity has made it possible to stretch beyond the confines of the 24-hour day, but in the process we have become untethered from the fundamental pulse of our planet. Science is revealing that we do so at our own risk. Some things have changed since Laber-Warren\u2019s article was published. \u00a0I no longer sleep in a tent. \u00a0The romance ended. \u00a0And my pronouns are he/his/him now. But much has remained the same. \u00a0I still love my \u201cprimal hobo life\u201d and hope to be able to continue my nomadic life for many years to come. \u00a0I wake up with or before the sun every day now. \u00a0I\u2019ve cobbled together a delightful mobile office inside my minivan and am getting better all the time at living fully within a minimalist, mobile lifestyle. My current goal is to shape a life where I maximize my writing time and my time spent in nature with a mid- to long-term goal of becoming completely self-supporting. \u00a0I sense it is within my grasp. I\u2019m more optimistic about achieving that goal than ever. -=- So that was enough set-up, I think. \u00a0You had to understand my non-24 and the huge impact it has had on my life and the extremes I have gone to in addressing how to have a satisfying life while living with non-24. \u00a0I wanted you to see how much I want to work and how excited I am as each piece of the answer to my struggle falls into place. You needed to understand how much my circadian rhythm disorders have shredded my life and how much work it has been to craft a life where I have a chance to succeed if I just focus on what keeps me writing, fed, fueled, and healthy. \u00a0For me, that is living in a minivan and seasonally migrating while writing all the time and periodically spending time with good people. So\u2026 back to telling you about when I met Temple Grandin. She was speaking at my university and I was very excited to hear what she had to say. The first thing I learned was access clash. \u00a0Dr. Grandin immediately moved the sign interpreter to the back of the stage. \u00a0She can\u2019t focus with anything moving around in her field of vision. \u00a0I can relate to that. \u00a0I have some issues with visual movement. \u00a0But I couldn\u2019t be happy about moving a sign interpreter to the back of the stage. \u00a0They belong out front and easy to see. \u00a0I understand that Dr. Grandin was the person we were all there to see, so her access needs were most important, but I would have a hard time nearly completely removing someone else\u2019s access in order to accommodate me. I learned something valuable from her actual presentation. \u00a0She talked about the different types of thinkers, saying that not all Autistics think in pictures like her. \u00a0She listed off the kinds of thinking and I immediately recognized myself when she described pattern thinkers. \u00a0So I learned something new about myself at her presentation. -=- During the presentation, I became very glad that I had ended up with a balcony seat. \u00a0I was full-body rocking as I listened to Dr. Grandin speak. \u00a0Someone seated down on the floor was rocking, too, and Temple had them removed to watch from another building on closed-circuit television. \u00a0Again, the motion was disrupting her presentation. Because I hadn\u2019t had to leave the building, I was able to get up and walk to the exit while I watched her field questions from lines of people walking up to the microphones. \u00a0I noticed, then and at other points during the evening, that Dr. Grandin has a lot of assistants helping everything move smoothly. \u00a0I hovered near the exit because I knew there would be a book signing and I wanted to get in line quickly to get my copy of  Animals in Translation  signed. -=- I didn\u2019t like a lot of the answers I heard. \u00a0Her childhood consisted\u00a0of that intensive, 40 hours a week, ABA therapy a lot of us Autistics warn against. \u00a0As a result, she believes what worked for her is the best way to treat autistic children. It\u2019s not that unusual a stance, really. \u00a0Think of the people you\u2019ve heard advocating for spanking children, saying things like, \u201clook at me. \u00a0I was spanked as a child and I turned out just fine. \u201d Dr. Grandin turned out fine, but she doesn\u2019t examine too closely whether that was because of or in spite of the therapy. Temple Grandin\u2019s mother was told to institutionalize her, but refused. \u00a0That is deeply admirable, but also a sign of privilege. \u00a0Most people could not afford the therapy back then. \u00a0Throughout Temple Grandin\u2019s life, privilege has provided a buffer against some of the harshness the world has on offer for Autistics. Or, as I wrote elsewhere: \u201cAs a result, Grandin clashes with: \n people from less advantaged socioeconomic positions than hers, \n people with multiple disabilities that require a delicate dance among often conflicting accommodations, \n people who are opposed to ABA and other compliance training, \n and all people who do not have access to the things that must seem perfectly basic, normal, and ordinary to someone born in the 1950s as a cis, asex, white, very financially comfortable, Autistic woman with anxiety and no other significant disabilities.\u201d \n So, yeah. As you can imagine, I did not like most of her answers to people\u2019s questions. \u00a0I kind of feel like just leaving it at that. I don\u2019t want to disrespect Temple Grandin. \u00a0She works hard. \u00a0She believes in what she\u2019s doing. \u00a0She has been tremendously successful in the field of animal agriculture and I respect her hard work. But it was hard listening to some of the things she said. \u00a0And it\u2019s even painful to recall some of it. -=- I wanted to get my book signed, so as soon as they finished the question and answer period, I speed-walked up to the tables to wait for Dr. Grandin to come around and I managed to be the first in line. \u00a0 That was focus on my part, for sure. I had rehearsed what I wanted to say to her, because I wanted my words to be haiku-tight, not wasting any time while still conveying a world of meaning behind the words. \n \u201cHello, I\u2019m Autistic, too, and I\u2019m a student here. \nThank you for what you did for the cows.\u201d \n I had rehearsed it carefully and in my imagination, she would say, \u201cthank you. How do you spell your name?\u201d with her pen hovering above a blank space in the front of the book, waiting to write my name and move on to the next person. \u00a0Temple Grandin, I reckoned, would be very busy signing books now. \u00a0I wanted everything to go smoothly because I didn\u2019t want to waste any of Dr. Grandin\u2019s time. -=- But it didn\u2019t go smoothly at all. \u00a0As you can see from the article about Temple Grandin that others like Teselecta and Becker\u00a0are upset and writing about, Dr. Grandin is positioning herself as a career counselor these days. So I got my first sentence out, but she interrupted me and I never got to offer gratitude on behalf of cattle everywhere. \u201cDo you have an internship?\u201d I blinked. Not the response I had expected. \u201cNo, I\u2019m in graduate school and will have to do teaching hours here as part of my degree,\u201d is what I would have said if I\u2019d been given a chance. \u00a0As it was, I only got the first syllable out when she swept in again, to lecture me about the importance of an internship, because Autistic people need to have real-world work experience before they leave school or else they will flounder. -=- Which, I\u2019m sure, is great advice for a lot of Autistic college students. \u00a0But I am multiply disabled and at the point that I went to see Dr. Grandin\u2019s presentation, I was trying to figure out, navigate, and self-advocate conducting my teaching hours\u00a0in spite of my non-24. \u00a0I wanted to do my teaching hours through asynchronous online education, as many of the classes I\u2019d taken in the economics department were conducted. But the political science department had not yet ventured into online education. \u00a0Because my first class taught would have to be as an assistant and because no professor in my department had made the move to asynchronous online education, my accommodation was not, legally speaking, \u00a0a reasonable accommodation. Legal precedent had already established that requiring a brick-and-mortar school to convert to online education when none had been conducted previously was unreasonable. And when I brought up the topic of asynchronous online education, the professors of my department laughed, so I knew it would be a losing battle. And at the same time, the non-24 was running me so ragged my grades were steadily dropping. As Emily Laber-Warren notes in the Scientific American Mind article featuring me, I had gone from being a dean\u2019s list student to a transcript covered with Ws and eventually failed my first class. \u00a0I was going through hard times when I met Temple Grandin, and her pressure to get an internship left me stuttering and unable to focus my thoughts enough to say much of anything coherent. -=- And as I struggled to make my struggles into anything resembling a sound bite, or even just a sound snack, Temple Grandin cut to the root of all my problems and announced her cure with eager pride: \u201cJust go to Target and buy yourself a really good alarm clock!\u201d \n \u2013 Temple Grandin, single-handedly curing an orphaned neurological disorder Wow. \u00a0My circadian specialist had studied sleep for years and practiced exclusively as a sleep specialist \u2014 no distracting animal agriculture on the side for him \u2014 and he had missed such a simple and affordable answer. And that is how Temple Grandin cured my hypernychthemeral syndrome. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/the-evening-temple-grandin-cured-my-hypernychthemeral-syndrome/", "title": "The Evening Temple Grandin Cured My Hypernychthemeral Syndrome"},

Thank you! The standard meaning of the phrase early intervention is to jump in with hours and hours of therapy to try to get an Autistic child to be \u201cindistinguishable from peers\u201d as quickly and as thoroughly as possible. This means extinguishing Autistic behaviors, even absolutely harmless ones that are beneficial to the Autistic person but embarrassing or off-putting to onlookers, the classic example of which is hand flapping. But Megen put a lovely spin on things by pointing out that it is the parents who need the early intervention. When autism can be recognized and identified early, the parents have a golden opportunity to begin working to understand the child they actually have. They can now learn about autistic neurology and stop interpreting their child through the wrong lens. Their child will be happier, healthier, and feel more love and acceptance for who they truly are once their parents\u2019 fear and confusion has cleared away. Parents can avoid shaming their child for being different and can come to understand that their job is not to try to shape their child like a lump of wet clay but to celebrate who their child is and work from there. Of course there will be some kinds of\u00a0specialized education. All children get education at home and at school, and identifying children who are neurodivergent in various ways means that those children can get more targeted education that works with their brain, not against it. Autistic children might need extra mentoring in coping with processing sensory input. All children need to learn how to self-soothe \u2014 none are born knowing that. Autistic children often need extra mentoring in that area. Later, it might be extra important that an Autistic child gets academic directions in a written form in addition to or instead of a spoken form. Or an Autistic child might need help with finding a method of communication that works well for that child since speaking isn\u2019t always the optimal choice. These kinds of interventions are very important. But the most important early intervention \u2014 and the earlier the better! \u2014 is for the parents. Let\u2019s all work to help parents of newly-identified Autistic children with their early intervention program. What can you do to help? When someone tells you that their child was just diagnosed, don\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Say, \u201cthat\u2019s great! Now you know what is going on. I\u2019m so glad you have that information.\u201d If you\u2019re a hugger and they\u2019re a hug-liking person, add a hug in there. Be friendly, encouraging, upbeat. If they are telling you this because your child is Autistic, there are other things you can say as well. Talk about the ways that it was helpful to learn about your child\u2019s autism. The newly-aware parent is probably feeling overwhelmed with all kinds of emotions. Emphasize what is good about getting the diagnosis to help that parent get a good start on this new phase of their life. Remind them that their child is still the beautiful, magical, wonderful child he or she has always been. Let them know that the only thing that has changed is that there is more information now, to help them understand their child better. We should all be as supportive of one another as we possibly can \u2014 parents, children, adult Autistics, professionals, everyone. But let\u2019s all try to be extra supportive of the newly-aware parents among us. If you are the parent of Autistic children, don\u2019t white-wash your life but do spend a little extra time talking about the good things. Spend a little extra time talking about great solutions you found that made your child\u2019s life better and, by extension, the whole family happier. Remind the newly-aware parent that *all* parenting is challenging. This is especially important, because parents whose children are not Autistic cannot say something like that. A parent who does not have an Autistic child is offensive if they remind others that all parenting is challenging because they are not speaking from the same set of experiences, but if you are parenting an Autistic child, please do take the time, when it feels appropriate to you, to remind others that all parenting is challenging because it help to put the struggles of families with Autistic members into perspective. Too often I see *everything* blamed on autism. Other families say \u201cit is hard to transition from one grade of school to the next,\u201d or \u201cthat first day of kindergarten is so hard because so many kids get upset when they realize they\u2019ve been left there without mom and dad,\u201d or \u201cthe hormonal changes of pre-teen and teen years can be so chaotic!\u201d Remind that newly-aware parent that they get to say those things, too. Of course it is different with autism because we Autistic people experience and think about the world differently, so we add our own individual flavor to every challenge of growing up and living life. But we are not off in our own world; we live in the same world as the rest of you. We are struggling with the same things everyone is: learning, growing, changing. Our life stories are unique, but just because everything we experience and do is \u201cautism colored\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that everything about our lives that is challenging for those around us is \u201call the fault of autism.\u201d\u00a0Gently help\u00a0that newly-aware parent to realize that blaming autism for everything difficult is the same as saying, \u201cmy child\u2019s worldview sucks.\u201d Gently remind them that children are not very good at separating the ideas of \u201cmy brain is different and that is a horrible thing\u201d from \u201cI am a horrible thing.\u201d And, honestly, I think the kids got it right. Any time I try to set my autism on one side and heap all my troubles over there with it and set \u201cme\u201d on the other side and heap all my joys there, I get a massive cognitive dissonance headache. It can take a long time to get there, but help those newly-aware parents learn that autism is not something their child has; it is something their child is. Help them shift their perspective so that they don\u2019t fall into the trap of hating autism and loving their child because that\u2019s a Gordion knot that gets harder to cut through the longer it is being knotted together. If you try to stick a sword into that, you\u2019re inevitably going to cut your child because it is impossible to find the place where autism ends and the child begins. Because that place isn\u2019t there. There is a reason the medical books call autism \u201cpervasive.\u201d It is in every part of a person \u2014 there is no part of me that is not Autistic. My brain is an autistic brain and everything I know, see, taste, hear, think, remember, hope, wish, feel, and do comes from that autistic brain. Help the newly-aware parents understand that if they love their child (and you know they do!) they are loving an Autistic child and that\u2019s a good thing. Early intervention is so crucial for future success. The faster we can get to those newly-aware parents, the more quickly we can soothe their fears, lead them to acceptance, help them to see the joy that they are inheriting from their children every day. Sure, it will be hard \u2014 all parenting is. Yes, there are things they can do to increase their child\u2019s chances of success. But they need to be canny and learn as quickly as possible that not every professional has their child\u2019s best interests at heart. They can be choosy and only take those therapies and lessons that help their child to grow strong and healthy. If we can get to those newly-aware parents as quickly as possible, we can save their\u00a0children a lot of suffering and the parents a lot of\u00a0grief and guilt. As Megen said, \u201cearly identification is so important!\u201d And it is because we have the best chance\u00a0when we can all help newly-aware parents with the early intervention they need so badly in order to thrive and to help their children thrive.

Toklas, used to sell.] an article on Lifehack about Avoidant Personality Disorder Finally I got to the section that said: \u201cWhat is known, however, is that symptoms first start manifesting from infancy or early childhood. The child will display shyness, isolation, or discomfort with new places or people. Often times, children who do exhibit these tendencies grow out of it, but those with the disorder will become even more shy and isolated with age.\u201d That clinched it for me. \u00a0I do not have Avoidant Personality Disorder if it is something that develops in childhood. \u00a0This is not to say that someone else would not have both autism and Avoidant Personality Disorder at the same time. I am not a medical or psychological professional so I can only talk about my own experiences and perceptions here, in hopes that it will help others feel less alone or maybe give someone new things to think about and new avenues to explore. \u00a0Even if I\u2019m simply venting my own frustrations to the void, that\u2019s helpful for me. So I\u2019ll continue. I effectively have a mimickry of Avoidant Personality Disorder, caused by 50 years of being bullied by others. I have carefully studied the bullying and done whatever I could to make it stop. I have changed the way I dress, the way I wear my hair, my grooming habits. \u00a0I have tried Dale Carnegie\u2019s methods outlined in his book  How to Win Friends and Influence People , I have tried sticking with social groups that center around my interests, I have tried surrounding myself with only fellow Autistics, I have tried blending into the background, and I have tried saying nothing at all ever. The bullying will never stop. After half a century of it, I have come to realize this. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t stop when you grow up, or when you go to college, or when you find a job, or when you find work that you are good at, or even when you find a community of people who are similarly brained and have all grown up with the same crushing bullying themselves. \u00a0It never stops and the only place where there is no bullying is alone. I\u2019m not saying this to get your pity. \u00a0As graffiti in an ADAPT video says, \u201cpiss on pity.\u201d \u00a0I am saying it because it is a solid fact that needs to be acknowledged. \u00a0No amount of zero tolerance policies can police the bullying away. \u00a0No amount of social skills training can teach the victim how to stop being whatever part of who they are that attracts the bullies. \u00a0The only way to stop the bullying is to stop letting bullies have access. Temple Grandin does it with money \u2014 she has enough money to pay people to form a human shield around her so that she can live in a bubble where bullies are not permitted entrance. \u00a0I don\u2019t have that kind of money and am not likely to ever have even a fraction of that kind of money . \u00a0The only way I can build a bully-free bubble in my life is to emulate Avoidant Personality Disorder. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t a conscious choice on my part \u2026 inch by inch, the bullies drove me back into myself. \u00a0Like a slinking night creature, I have crept further and further from the glowing campfires of humanity and into the safe and soothing darkness of solitude. Those who counseled me to \u201cjust put yourself out there\u201d \u00a0are complicit with the bullies. \u00a0Those advisors have encouraged me to boldly stride behind enemy lines, unarmed. Sometimes they even blamed me for the shelling I received as a result. When I tell people about the bullying, I get a few different reactions. \u00a0One popular answer is to tell me I\u2019m bringing it all on myself. \u00a0If I just weren\u2019t so \u2026 If I didn\u2019t insist on always \u2026 \u00a0If I\u2019d just stop \u2026 And why can\u2019t I blend in better? Another answer I get is that I\u2019m blowing it all out of proportion. \u00a0Everybody gets teased. \u00a0It\u2019s part of how people make friends with each other and I just need to lighten up a little and learn to laugh at myself. Some well-meaning people tell me that they can\u2019t see how anyone would want to bully me because I\u2019m such a kind and gentle, loving person. \u00a0The thing is, whether I\u2019m kind or whether I\u2019m a jerk, the bullying is real and denying it could be possible is calling me a liar when I tell you that it does happen. Let me talk a little bit about the traits of Avoidant Personality Disorder from the article \u2014 the traits that caused me to briefly question whether I might have Avoidant Personality Disorder or not. (I don\u2019t. \u00a0Through most of my childhood, I virtually flung myself at others. \u00a0 I am an extrovert  and  I spent my 20s seeking out human company  all the time, alternating between hope and despair. \u00a0It has only been in middle age that I have begun giving up and avoiding people. \u00a0The accumulated years of bullying have finally weighted me down sufficiently to provoke an avoidant, hiding response to life.) Reluctance to be involved with people unless certain they will be liked. This has been me for a long time. \u00a0Lately I\u2019ve been feeling pessimistic enough about people liking me that I\u2019m reluctant to be involved with anyone. \u00a0This is not just the depression talking (although that\u2019s a contributing factor, for sure.) \u00a0I have gotten enough screen shots handed to me of people who smile to my face and then talk hate about me behind my back that I\u2019ve learned not to trust anyone. But even before I reached this critical mass, I have had a tendency for years to assume the worst. \u00a0If someone is not clearly welcoming toward me, I assume they are just tolerating me and I try to go away before they reach the end of their tolerance. \u00a0This is learned behavior on my part. \u00a0After experiencing the same thing again and again, my pattern recognition finally kicked in. \u00a0It is other people\u2019s behavior that has taught me that someone who does not make it clear that they enjoy my presence might eventually \u201csnap\u201d and start abusing me because I didn\u2019t get all their hints. Hints that I can\u2019t see. I can see people welcoming me and I can see people abusing me, but I can\u2019t see all those little nudges and hints and insinuations and sarcasms, and social corrections. So when people aren\u2019t clearly welcoming, it\u2019s an act of self-preservation to go away before the abuse starts. Takeaway lesson: if you appreciate an Autistic person, make sure to let them know. \u00a0Take the emotional risk. \u00a0Tell them that they\u2019re wanted and liked or loved. \u00a0You might embarrass them, sure. \u00a0But you will also be engaging in clear communication that lets them know they are wanted and should stick around. Avoidance of activities (whether professional or personal) that would require significant contact with others due to fear of rejection or criticism. I just quit a job last week. \u00a0I won\u2019t pretend it was the greatest job ever. \u00a0It was a job that claimed to pay $8.10 an hour and, technically, did. \u00a0But it had such a draconian break policy that the realistic pay for the time I was required to be at their place of business in order to get my work done was more like $4.05 to $5.40 per hour. But even with that, I needed that job. \u00a0Four bucks an hour ain\u2019t much, but money is money and I\u2019m a little bit addicted to eating. So is my cat. But the bullying was so crushing, I had to leave before the bullies stripped me of the shreds of self-preservation I had left. The ringleader set me up so perfectly. \u00a0He started out being very interested in what I had to say. \u00a0He encouraged me to talk more. \u00a0He found opportunities to get me alone to encourage me to open up even further, one-on-one. \u00a0He showed interest in my writing and even started reading my book. He had gotten five chapters into it by the time I left. I came to be deeply emotionally invested in him and his circle of friends. And then one day, when the hooks were good and set in me, he turned on me. \u00a0He shouted at me. He called me names. \u00a0And his friends began to perform live theater in front of me \u2014 imitating me, my movements, my way of talking, my favorite subjects. \u00a0But all of it embarrassingly exaggerated, grotesque, and insulting. I couldn\u2019t even walk through the hall at work without getting waylaid and berated. \u00a0I started hiding in my car, missing hours. \u00a0I was falling behind in my hours and the boss said I had to make them up. I would have had to live at work all day long to make up those hours but the C-PTSD from all the years of bullying in school had kicked in at full force and my bullies started making a point of surrounding me. We could sit wherever we wanted in the workroom and I would quickly become surrounded by my bullies who would stare at me while they talked to each other and laughed. I know it doesn\u2019t sound like much. \u00a0But try it some time. \u00a0Life gets pretty grim when the only people you are ever in contact with are so clearly targeting you. I was becoming suicidal. \u00a0I couldn\u2019t possibly make up those lost hours. In a last ditch effort to save my life, I quit. Significant contact with others is not viable for me. \u00a0I have to meter my contact with people. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t take long before they realize I\u2019m only there to be their punching bag. \u00a0Places I can\u2019t retreat, places I can\u2019t hide \u2014 these are dangerous places full of bullies I can\u2019t escape. Takeaway lesson: If you know an Autistic who doesn\u2019t want to go someplace, take them seriously. \u00a0Investigate. \u00a0Empathize. \u00a0Don\u2019t just decide they\u2019re being lazy or willful. \u00a0There\u2019s a good chance they\u2019re being damaged by that place and what happens there. Don\u2019t jump to automatically contribute to the damage by forcing them to be there. \u00a0Find out what\u2019s wrong. Unwillingness to try new things due to shyness or feelings of inadequacy, particularly in social situations. My feelings of inadequacy in social situations are very real. \u00a0I am not suffering Avoidant Personality Disorder \u2013 I am suffering humanity. People are cruelly unforgiving of those who cannot figure out the social rules and conform to them. \u00a0People are exploitative of those who struggle to conform to the social rules and thus are easy dupes for con artists. Yes, I am unwilling to try new things, so long as there are people involved with those things. I saw a pair of roller skates I really like and would get if I had income, but I don\u2019t want to skate with other people. \u00a0I would love to spend more time hiking on trails but only if I can go alone. I love camping but I don\u2019t want to camp with others. \u00a0I\u2019m interested in trying new kinds of writing, new art techniques. \u00a0I\u2019d like to play new musical instruments. I love learning languages but am limited in how far I can go because I don\u2019t actually want to have a conversation in any language. I am always open to the new experience \u2026. but only if I can do it alone, without observers, without companions, without bullies. Takeaway lesson: \u00a0if you know someone Autistic who doesn\u2019t want to try something new, don\u2019t assume it\u2019s \u201cjust the autism.\u201d \u00a0There could be other reasons. \u00a0You might be the reason. If you didn\u2019t react well the last times they tried new things, they might not want to try more new things \u2026. when you are around. Sensitivity to criticism, rejection, or disapproval. Tell me what \u201csensitivity\u201d \u00a0means? \u00a0Am I sensitive when I have been wounded again and again until I spend all my energy trying to spot the landmines and skirt around them? \u00a0Is a soldier sensitive to Claymore mines? Is it right to call me sensitive after five decades of walking a never-ending social minefield? Difficulty with building intimate relationships because of fears and insecurities. I don\u2019t trust anyone. \u00a0How could I possibly build a close friendship or relationship when those connections are based on mutual trust and I have long since run out of trust? I watched  13 Reasons Why  and I could understand why Hannah became so guarded. \u00a0 After enough abuse had been heaped on her, she could never have dated Clay because she had lost the ability to trust that anyone could possibly like her and want to be with her just because she was a great person. \u00a0Everyone abused and exploited her and then sneered at her as a \u201cdrama queen\u201d \u00a0when it was their treatment that had caused her to become so distressed in the first place. This is what we do to victims of bullies. \u00a0We look at the depressed, broken shells they have become and we blame them for it, telling them that their brokenness is why they are bullied. It\u2019s like telling someone that they just need to stop bleeding and the sharks will ignore them. \u00a0But it was the sharks that bit them in the first place and they will never stop their feeding frenzy until they have devoured all the blood. \u00a0Bullies devour their victims and they aren\u2019t even courteous enough to swallow them whole. \u00a0They tear pieces off them. \u00a0And more pieces. \u00a0And then they get excited when they see the emotional blood leaking from the wounds and bite larger and larger chunks, hypnotized by their own power to destroy another human being. Is anyone surprised at difficulty with building intimate relationships after one\u2019s being has been shredded by the shark teeth of constant bullying? \u00a0What about the fears and insecurities that are real? How much does cognitive behavioral therapy repair a person who is afraid of and insecure about something that has been happening every time they are around people ever? \u00a0How much therapy does it take to erase fifty years of bullying? Feelings of being socially inept, inferior, or unappealing to others. As a result, there are tendencies to have extremely low self-esteem. I wonder about this. \u00a0Self-esteem, that is. All my life, I have been told that I have low self-esteem. \u00a0I can see why people would say that. \u00a0I don\u2019t \u201cput myself out there.\u201d \u00a0I look at the ground when I walk (Partly because I don\u2019t want to accidentally make eye contact with anyone but just as much because I need to see the ground. \u00a0I have bad balance and low proprioception. \u00a0If I can\u2019t see the ground when I walk, I fall and hurt myself.) Does it sound like low self-esteem when I say I am pathetic at making and keeping friends? \u00a0Is it still low self-esteem when it\u2019s the truth? Does it sound like low self-esteem when I say that there just aren\u2019t enough accommodations to make it possible for me to keep a job (I was kind of doing okay at the last really crappy and underpaid job until everyone decided to team up to make my life hell for their amusement) and that I struggle with poverty as a result? \u00a0Is it low self-esteem when the truth is that my multiple disabilities get in the way and I really can\u2019t support myself financially? I don\u2019t actually think I have low self-esteem. \u00a0I am not happy with my body (who is?) but I know there is hope that I will be able to afford medical transition some day and I can finally feel at peace in my skin. \u00a0But I also know I am more than just my body and I love the way I solve problems and puzzles. \u00a0I love my musical talents. \u00a0I\u2019m still learning to draw, but I\u2019m very proud of how quickly I\u2019ve learned and how fast I \u2018m progressing. \u00a0I am proud of my writing skill and pleased to see that skill improving all the time. \u00a0I am a compassionate, empathetic, kind-hearted person. \u00a0When I am not depressed by poverty and bullying, I know that I matter. \u00a0I help people all the time. \u00a0My heart is filled with love. \u00a0I feel at home in nature. \u00a0I am a good person. If I really am socially inept and unappealing to others (except as an amusing punching bag), is it fair to call my reaction of despair \u201clow self-esteem\u201d? \u00a0It sounds like the problem is being centered in me rather than in the people who go out of their way to make my life as miserable as they can get away with. Takeaway lesson: \u00a0telling someone about their \u201clow self-esteem\u201d that only cropped up as a result of being mistreated by others is just another way to blame the victim for suffering someone else caused. Yes, I am avoidant. No, it is not a personality disorder. It is a matter of survival. The recent bullying is so fresh that it took me four hours of sitting in my car in the McDonald\u2019s parking lot yesterday to finally overcome my physical exhaustion and go inside to get some electricity for my battery and get a little work done. Avoiding is the tip of the iceberg. \u00a0Being avoidant is debilitating and not always for the reasons you might assume. \u00a0I am so tired all the time. \u00a0I am worn out from carrying the burden of bullying all the time. \u00a0I am exhausted. \u00a0There is so much I want to do \u2014 I have long lists of things I\u2019m excited to write, draw, record. \u00a0But I\u2019m running out of steam. \u00a0Survival is too hard. \u00a0It\u2019s ground me down. \u00a0I\u2019m wearing out. The price of permitting bullying to continue is unreasonable \u2014 at least for me. \u00a0Maybe it\u2019s because the rest of the world doesn\u2019t have to pay my price \u2014 and because they have no idea what I would put into the world if I just had a little more energy \u2014 that they don\u2019t care much about stopping bullies. You can do your part, though. \u00a0Stand up against bullying. \u00a0If you can do it without making too much of a target of yourself, speak up when you see bullying. \u00a0You might have to watch for it, though. \u00a0Bullying is all around you and you don\u2019t see it. In high school I was so bullied that classmates put sexual statements about me in the school newspaper. \u00a0\u201cThat couldn\u2019t be true,\u201d \u00a0my mother said. \u201cIt was a good school. \u00a0They wouldn\u2019t have let that happen.\u201d But they did it in code. \u00a0That\u2019s how they got away with it. \u00a0People are being bullied all around you and you don\u2019t even see it! They started by telling me they knew I was selling sex. (Good grief! I was 13 years old!) and that they heard I did it under a bridge on Dixie Highway. \u00a0(What bridge? There is no bridge on Dixie Highway. \u00a0They picked that road because it was on the south side of town where I lived and they had already spent months tormenting me about living on the poor side of town and wearing crappy clothes. \u00a0Making this alleged sex selling take place under a bridge on Dixie Highway was just a way to fold their poverty shaming in with their sex shaming.) So when the school newspaper had a gossip column and the gossip column said, \u201cand which seventh grader was spotted under the Dixie Highway bridge last Friday night?\u201d it was crystal clear to me and my bullies what had just happened \u2014 I couldn\u2019t even read the damned school newspaper without being jabbed by my bullies. \u00a0But it was completely invisible to faculty and parents. Bullying goes on right under your nose all the time. \u00a0It\u2019s impossible to stop it. But I hope you\u2019ll try anyway. It\u2019s too late for me. \u00a0But there are children being shredded by the shark teeth right now. \u00a0Don\u2019t let them grow up to be people who can\u2019t even go to work because the shark bites never healed and run so deep that they bleed all the time, continuing to attract more sharks all the time. Don\u2019t feed the sharks. \u00a0Take their food away from them. \u00a0And don\u2019t blame the victims of shark attacks by telling them they smell like sharkbait. The Lifehack article says: \u201cThe cause of Avoidant Personality Disorder is still undiscovered, but scientists believe that it may stem from genetics or as a result of childhood environments, such as experiencing emotional neglect from parents or peers.\u201d So maybe I do have Avoidant Personality Disorder after all. \u00a0Maybe I\u2019m just incredibly resilient and it took decades of bullying and emotional neglect to create Avoidant Personality Disorder in me whereas most people develop it after only a few years of the same. It should be a crime. \u00a0And the whole damned world is guilty. So why is it me that has to live in the prison they created with their mockery and hatred? Why am I the one being punished for everyone else\u2019s lack of \u2026. well, I was going to say lack of humanity, but since they all behave this way I guess bullying is definitionally an act of humanity. \u00a0It seems to be me who is not part of the fold. I don\u2019t have any answers to that. But from my prison I will continue to send out love letters and lifelines of hope and poetic writing for others to catch hold of like a rope tossed from an extreme place. \u00a0Sure, the bullies will catch hold of that rope and jerk on it. \u00a0They always do. \u00a0They won\u2019t ever stop. \u00a0But my words will sail over their heads at the same time, floating out to the world where they will offer those with the shark tooth shaped scars on their spirit the healing balm of knowing someone else sees, someone else knows, someone else understands. \u00a0I know what the sharks can do and I offer you the only thing I have: my words. And this is what I say to you who are circled by sharks: escape. Find a break in the wall of sharks and swim through as quickly as you can. \u00a0Don\u2019t look back. \u00a0Stay one stroke ahead of the sharks and there is good life to be found in the water. Don\u2019t sink. \u00a0Don\u2019t drown. \u00a0Keep swimming. Do not let the sharks decide what you are worth and what you get to do. Okay, I know that, to some degree, they do and will. \u00a0The sharks own this world. But there are stretches of clear blue water on smooth seas filled with playful dolphins and swaying anemones. \u00a0Find them. \u00a0Strike out and find your safe waters and own them. And I\u2019ll keep swimming too. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/how-autism-can-mimic-avoidant-personality-disorder/", "title": "How Autism Can Mimic Avoidant Personality Disorder"},

Jones, Taken in southeastern Gainesville, Florida.] I winter in Gainesville, because the city has laws to protect people like me. So long as I am legally parked, it is not against the law for me to sleep in my vehicle in Gainesville. This may seem ordinary if you\u2019ve never tried living the way I do, but most clement places enact measures to keep \u201cundesirables\u201d under control. Every major city in California now\u00a0has anti-homelessness laws on the books that were written to protect the people who do not like to see homeless people in public (rather than being written to protect the actual homeless people, themselves.) If I wintered in California, I would regularly be at risk of having my van impounded as punishment for living in it. \u00a0I know, I know. It makes no sense to fight homelessness by taking away someone\u2019s shelter. But it\u2019s a real risk in many places. As for Texas, I have been hassled by the police after spending 18 hours at a designated campground. \u00a0I\u2019ve never been bothered here in Gainesville for openly living my mobile lifestyle. Gainesville is also a safe place to transition my gender expression. The mayor of Gainesville, Lauren Poe, recently\u00a0 wrote on Facebook : \u201cIf you are trans and feeling under threat, come to Gainesville. We respect you, love you and if need-be, we will protect you.\u201d In a nation that seems obsessed with which bathroom I use, it is a great comfort to spend my winters in a city that added \u201cgender identity\u201d to their anti-discrimination laws in 2008. \u00a0Gainesville is a safe place and I can feel my spirit grow when I spend time here. This winter, I read (in audiobook format) Andrew Chaiken\u2019s epic 1994 book about the Apollo missions,  A Man on the Moon , as I drove around Gainesville\u2019s streets filled with murals and quirky folk art. When Mr. Kitty and I take a night trip down 8th avenue, through the Solar Walk, I like to imagine that we\u00a0are traveling through space in our Escape Pod. \u00a0The sculpted concrete stars and planets on the sidewalk beside us are\u00a0heavy echoes of the originals, gleaming high above. We are surrounded by stars. It was on one of those night runs down the Solar Corridor that I realized my current life motto: What would an astronaut do? I have been on a quest the last several years to improve my emotional self-regulation. I have progressed tremendously as anyone close to me will readily attest. What would an astronaut do? An astronaut would remain calm, particularly in a crisis. \u00a0An astronaut would not give up when faced with a problem, but rather think things through, logically and carefully, finding tools in his environment to achieve his goals. The Apollo 13 mission nearly ended in as much tragedy as the Apollo 1 mission. \u00a0A cabin fire in Apollo 1 killed all three astronauts \u2014 Grissom, White, and Chafee \u2014 on the launch pad in 1967. \u00a0For a time, it appeared that the pilots of Apollo 13 \u2014 Lovell, Swigert, and Haise \u2014 would suffer a similar fate after an oxygen tank exploded, two days out from Earth, damaging the Service Module, thus also rendering the Command Module useless. \u00a0The interior of their spacecraft began losing life-sustaining heat quickly, water was in short supply, and the astronauts were at risk of asphyxiation from their own exhaled carbon dioxide. What would an astronaut do? Get on the radio and calmly announce, \u201cHouston, we have a problem here.\u201d \u00a0Troubleshoot the problem along with help from Houston. \u00a0And build a carbon-dioxide scrubber out of a flight manual cover, parts from their space suits, and a pair of socks. I have been working to incorporate the lessons of the Apollo astronauts into my daily life: Stay calm. Maintain logic and problem-solving skills such as flexible thinking and improvisation. Focus on the mission. I\u2019ve particularly been spending a lot of time thinking about what it means to focus on the mission. Focusing on the mission means that the activism and advocacy work we Autistic adults and non-autistic parents of Autistics are doing is more important than interpersonal squabbles. \u00a0Sometimes we have goals so incompatible that we cannot work together, but whenever I am seeking the same goal as someone else, it is important for me to promote their work, no matter whether we get along as individuals. Focusing on the mission means trying to get along with everyone, but also staying socially detached enough to avoid allowing my feelings about a person affect my respect for their work. I was writing something the other day, in which I mentioned \u201cmy mission.\u201d \u00a0I have been thinking about my mission for a long time and, more and more, I have been wanting an actual mission statement. I talk about being on a mission, but I don\u2019t always communicate that mission in specific, clear terms. So I would like to take this opportunity to share my mission statement: -=+*+=- Pre-amble: All people have inherent worth; human life cannot be valued in the coin of productivity. What makes people matter is that they exist. There are no \u201cspecial needs.\u201d \u00a0All humans have needs and by calling some needs \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cordinary\u201d and other needs \u201cspecial,\u201d we set one group of people aside as potential \u201cburdens\u201d who should be grateful for the \u201cspecial treatment\u201d they get. Access is crucial for full participation in society. \u00a0The principle of universal design must be extended to all, making all public access accessible to people regardless of mobility, neurotype, physical appearance including race and size, gender, communication style, support needs, and more. Respect autonomy and presume competence. The children of today must not be forced to suffer tomorrow the things we endured yesterday. I yearn to hand an oxygen mask of survival and a flotation device of self-worth to every human being. \u00a0I can only achieve this work if I keep one oxygen mask and one flotation device for myself. Mission: My mission is to work every day to maintain my own survival so that I can help others maintain theirs. My mission is to add more love to and remove more stigma and misunderstanding from the world. My mission is to join every day in the effort to shift society\u2019s views to a more compassionate, understanding, accepting position from which diversity can truly be celebrated rather than feared. -=+*+=- This is my mission and every time I ask myself, \u00a0\u201cwhat would an astronaut do?\u201d and the answer is \u201cfocus on the mission,\u201d this is the mission. \u00a0This is what I am striving to draw more of into my life and, through me, into the world: more love, more understanding, more thriving. And now I must carry on with the mission. Do carry on with yours and insofar as our missions intersect, may we always merge our efforts and achieve greater success than we each could have grasped alone.

Image copyright Sparrow R. Jones] \u00a0 Sometimes now, from a distance of decades, I can explain my behavior. Time, experience, and an increased vocabulary have helped me to understand my younger self better and be more well-equipped to communicate my childhood thoughts than I was at the time. \u00a0 But just as often, I still have no idea why I did or said the things I did because I still have so little connection with or understanding of my emotional life, both in childhood and today. \u00a0 I have a condition called alexithymia. The name comes from Greek roots: a-, meaning \u2018without\u2019, lexi, meaning \u2018words\u2019, and thymia, meaning \u2019emotions.\u2019 Without words for emotions. \u00a0 That\u2019s a pretty good name for it, because that\u2019s pretty much what it is. I do have emotions \u2014 quite strong emotions, in fact. Much stronger than I wish they were. But when I try to understand what I\u2019m feelign or why I\u2019m feeling it, I am at a loss. \u00a0I can generally tell you (sometimes after pausing to do an internal assessment first) if I\u2019m generally feeling \u201cgood\u201d \u00a0or \u201cbad.\u201d \u00a0I can usually put words to the emotions that are painted in very broad strokes: happy, sad, angry. But that\u2019s about the limit of my emotional vocabulary. \u00a0 To me, emotions are like storms at sea. \u00a0They are mysterious and unpredictable. I feel like I can go from zero to furious in 0.4 seconds because I am unable to see all the intermediate shades of emotion along the route to furious, so when I finally arrive at that destination, it feels to me as if it came out of nowhere. \u00a0I think it often seems that way to onlookers as well, because my Autistic style of emoting is not always very easy for people to understand. \u00a0 I regularly get feedback from others who have interpreted my \u201ccontented\u201d \u00a0as \u201cdistraught\u201d (it\u2019s called \u201cresting face,\u201d \u00a0people. \u00a0Mine apparently has a sad/angry tone to it, so I have learned that I have to intentionally add artificial smiles to my face if I don\u2019t want others to accidentally mis-read me as dangerous and unapproachable.) I\u2019ve also gotten feedback from people who see \u201cnervous\u201d \u00a0or \u201d anxious\u201d \u00a0when I am actually \u201cenergetic and happy.\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s called stimming, folks\u2026..it\u2019s not always a sign of anxiety in people with my neurology. Ironically, I have been riddled with anxiety but when I discuss it with someone who doesn\u2019t know me extremely well, they think I\u2019m exaggerating because they can\u2019t see the external signs of anxiety they are accustomed to reading from non-autistic people\u2019s body language. \u00a0 I try my best to live in the deep waters beneath that stormy surface. Meditation helps a lot. \u00a0My role model is Mr. Spock from Star Trek. \u00a0Vulcans have emotions but practice meditation and other rituals from an early age to learn to control their emotions rather than allowing their emotions to control them. \u00a0I work hard to replicate fictional Vulcan emotional training as best I can in my frustratingly non-fiction \u00a0human life. Sometimes it even works. \u00a0I get better at it as time goes on. But I still \u201close it\u201d \u00a0on a regular basis. \u00a0It\u2019s a work in progress. \u00a0 A  2016 article in Scientific American  says that 10% of the general population has alexithymia while 50% of Autistics have alexithymia. I have seen other sources estimate higher numbers, but 50% is a good, conservative estimate. \u00a0My reading indicates that alexithymia in the non-autistic population is very oftne the result of an emotional trauma. \u00a0No one (to my knowledge. If you know of a case, please share it in the comments) has studied whether Autistic alexithymia is the result of emotional trauma (which wouldn\u2019t surprise me, since growing up Autistic in a non-autistic society can be intensely traumatizing) or whether it\u2019s part of how many of us are wired. \u00a0 The difference \u2014 autism with or without alexithymia \u2014 could explain many of the differences among Autistics, for example, it might be part of the explanation for why some of us (like me) avoid eye contact while I\u2019ve met lots of other Autistics who report having no trouble at all with making eye contact with others. \u00a0 Having alexithymia (and some states-of-being that seem closely connected for me, such as a very low level of body-awareness) means that when I figure out that I am feeling bad, I have to play detective to try to understand why I am feelign bad and what, if anything, I should do about it. \u00a0 I have developed a sort of check-list to help me navigate the experience of being embodied. \u00a0 First I have to figure out if I am in need of my checklist. Here are some of my warning signs that I\u2019m not functioning optimally: \u00a0 \n I am screaming \n I am crying \n My body is shaking \n I am obsessively going over unpleasant past memories \n I am spontaneously (meaning I am doing it during my personal time, not as research for something I am writing) conducting Google searches \u00a0on topics related to unpleasant human interactions and how to cope with them \n I am dizzy or experiencing some non-typical (for me) cognitive difficulties \n I have lost the ability to speak \n I find myself unwilling to go someplace or do something I either enjoy or know that I need to do in order to keep my world intact (like the tax office or the social Security office) \n I am not sleeping (or sleeping too much) \n I am not eating (or eating too much) \n I am constantly thinking bad thoughts about everything the people around me are doing \n \u00a0 These are my main warning signs that I need to run a self-diagnostic check. \u00a0If you have similar difficulties to the ones I discuss in this essay, you might want to write out your own list of warning signs. \u00a0 My diagnostic checklist starts with medical emergencies and works its way down from there. \u00a0 \n Check my blood sugar \n Check my temperature \n Assess whether I need to use the bathroom (strange though it may sound to those who don\u2019t experience this, I am often unaware of physical needs unless I specifically direct my attention to the body I live in and focus on the physical sensations it is experiencing.) \n When did I last sleep? Am I sleep deprived? \n When did I last hydrate? \n When did I last eat? \n Am I experiencing an emotion? Try to discern whether it is mostly anger or mostly sorrow. Continue to break it down from there, looking for physical clues. \n \u00a0 A book I\u2019ve found helpful in this last task is:  The Emotion Thesaurus . \u00a0It is a book for writers and it includes descriptions of the physical things that happen to the body when experiencing 75 different emotions. I would love to have the emotion body responses turned into a deck of cards I could carry in my pocket. \u00a0 The only emotion cards I\u2019ve ever seen are profoundly unhelpful for me because they just have things like photographs of human faces experiencing feelings (useless for me as I can\u2019t read feelings from a photograph) or even worse, cartoon drawings of emotions. \u00a0I need the body experience descriptions like in the Emotion Thesaurus to help me identify the emotions my body is having. \u00a0 Usually by this point in my checklist I\u2019ve found my trouble. \u00a0If not, I just try to do what I can to mitigate the damage \u2014 isolate myself from others, be kind and nurturing to myself, try to dive beneath the surface if I can and if I can\u2019t, I try to wait for the storm to blow over and the sea to become calm again. \u00a0 I wish I had more to say about emotions and alexithymia, but I\u2019ve pretty much hit the end of what I have on offer for this topic. \u00a0If you\u2019ve read my blog for very long, you\u2019ll realize what a statement that is, because my standard blog essay is twice the length of this one. \u00a0Struggling with emotional lability and alexithymia has been the battle of a lifetime for me and I sometimes wryly joke that I\u2019ll finally get it figured out when I\u2019m lying on my deathbed at 120 years old. \u00a0Things do seem to be getting better, though. My 40s have been much better than my 30s. \u00a0My teens and 20s were such horror shows I\u2019m amazed I survived them. I predict my 50s will be my best decade yet. \u00a0 If you\u2019re a parent and you\u2019re struggling with your child\u2019s emotions, you might feel like life is punishing you, but I\u2019m here to tell you that the real hell is the one your child is living through. \u00a0I know it\u2019s hard to be gentle and understanding with someone who yells and throws things, hits and bites. But I\u2019ve been that person for a lot of my life and gentle understanding is exactly what we need most. \u00a0Help your beloved person learn how to trouble shoot and do self-checks. \u00a0Help them learn how to decipher and name emotions. \u00a0Help them find emotional management techniques that work for them. \u00a0 Don\u2019t get upset if they reject meditation or breathing techniques. \u00a0We\u2019re all different and some Autistics get *MORE* anxious when they try to use these tools. Don\u2019t be afraid to try medications but work to avoid \u201cdrugged zombie\u201d \u00a0as a chosen result. \u00a0It might be easier for people around us when we\u2019re doped out of our emotions, but it\u2019s not good for us. \u00a0Vow to only use medication that enhances an Autistic\u2019s life and coping skills, and never use medication or dosage levels that operates as a \u201cchemical straitjacket\u201d. \u00a0 Our responses to medications are often non-standard so be prepared to experiment with much smaller (or much larger) doses than other people need. \u00a0For example, Temple Grandin recommends using only a 1/3 dose of anti-anxiety medications when prescribing for Autistic people. \u00a0 I hope something, anything, I\u2019ve written here is helpful to you. \u00a0I\u2019d love to see a lot of discussion in the comments section. \u00a0This is a topic I\u2019ve struggled so hard with \u00a0that I feel inadequate to even address it at all. \u00a0But it needs to be said, so here I am saying it. \u00a0Be well, gentle readers, and may your emotions ever serve you rather than the other way around. \u00a0 edited to add: A linkback from another blog that linked to this post included a link to an alexithymia questionnaire that quanitifes one\u2019s level of Alexithymia. \u00a0I scored  149 , \u201c high alexithymic traits .\u201d \u00a0 The other blog entry is:  Can you name all those emotions? \nAnd the emotion blindness\u00a0questionnaire is:  Online Alexithymia Questionnaire ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/alexithymia-i-dont-know-how-i-feel/", "title": "Alexithymia: I Don\u2019t Know How I Feel"},

The sun is just hidden behind the branch and its light shines down through the limbs, illuminating the fluffy yet intricate twists of parasitic angiosperm, creating something of a magical, ethereal effect in the process. Photo copyright Sparrow Rose, 2016] Content note: descriptions of shutdown, meltdown, self-injurious activity, stress, brain function. \u00a0 By now, pretty much everyone who knows\u00a0much of anything about autism\u00a0has heard of meltdowns \u2014 episodes of frustration and panic that seriously disrupt the lives of Autistic people, to varying degrees and amounts per person. But shutdowns don\u2019t seem to get talked about as much as meltdowns and I run into people who, despite the blue-illuminated buckets of \u201cautism awareness\u201d out there, were completely unaware of the phenomenon of shutdown. I had a pretty bad shutdown last week so I thought I ought to write a little bit about them. The people in my day-to-day life were unprepared to deal with a shutdown and that increased everyone\u2019s stress levels. More education about shutdowns can\u2019t hurt and it could help quite a bit. Shutdowns and meltdowns are more similar than they might appear on the surface. One (somewhat simplistic but workable) way to think of shutdown is a meltdown turned inward instead of outward, much as some people describe depression as anger turned inward. My most recent shutdown started off as a meltdown. My brain was going through all its usual short-circuits when some synaptic gap got crossed. Or something. One minute I was out of control, smacking myself in the face, as one does, and the next minute I was on the floor, unable to move. I started to get tunnel vision. My hearing began to get fuzzy. My vision closed and closed like turning off an old tube-driven television, closing down to a tiny dot of light that winked out just as my hearing entirely cut out, leaving me alone in the numbly terrifying darkness. If you like to get your information from audio and video, you should take ten minutes to go watch Amethyst Schaber\u2019s magnificent  discussion of Autistic shutdown on their YouTube channel, \u201cAsk an Autistic.\u201d \u00a0I\u2019ll wait. Shutdown is a response to overwhelm. It is a self-protective response \u2014 shutting down the circuits before they fry, to use computer/brain analogies \u2014 but it is as much a system overload as it is a system failsafe. And too much overwhelm for too long can cause some longer-term shutdown and loss of basic skills. We\u2019re talking everything from forgetting how to tie your shoes to forgetting how to speak. And it can hit at age 14 or age 24 or age 54. As  Mel Baggs explained it : \u201d\u00a0Most people have a level to which they are capable of functioning without burnout, a level to which they are capable of functioning for emergency purposes only, and a level to which they simply cannot function. In autistic people in current societies, that first level is much narrower. Simply functioning at a minimally acceptable level to non-autistic people or for survival, can push us into the zone that in a non-autistic person would be reserved for emergencies. Prolonged functioning in emergency mode can result in loss of skills and burnout.\u201d I my case, it was just a matter of hours before I started coming out of shutdown, much like an ocean creature finally creeping onto a deserted beach after a long swim across the Marianas Trench of shutdown. But I only had one, isolated shutdown. An extended amount of time living on \u201cpersonal emergency reserves\u201d due to being forced to operate at a higher clock speed than my chips are rated for, combined with a series of shutdowns would have left me pretty burned out. I\u2019ve gone 17 days in shutdown before, unable to speak or properly care for myself. This is why shutdowns must be treated with caution and this is why going to apparent extremes to avoid shutdown is not \u201clazy,\u201d \u201cspoiled,\u201d\u00a0 \u201centitled,\u201d or any other judgmental adjective\u00a0anyone has ever been tempted to drop at an Autistic\u2019s feet. Or heap on\u00a0an Autistic\u2019s head, for that matter, since it\u2019s often on the floor alongside the feet once shutdown hits. Miller and Loos wrote about shutdowns and stress, both  in a manner accessible to laypeople  and in an  academic paper . Their observations were based on a case study of an Autistic six-year-old girl who was prone to shutdown under stress. The authors found that shutdown behavior gets labelled as conscious avoidance but is more likely an involuntary\u00a0physiological process caused by \u201cstress instability,\u201d an inability to regulate the body\u2019s overwhelming response to stressors. The authors hypothesize that shutdown begins with the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the brain\u00a0and quickly spirals into a debilitating feedback loop: the BLA is involved in experiencing emotions. When the BLA becomes overstimulated, it can become hyperreactive, leading to extreme emotionality, heightened levels of fear, and social withdrawal. The BLA can quickly become hyperreactive when exposed for too long to corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a \u201cstress-mediating neurotransmitter.\u201d In other words, stress gives the BLA a hair trigger and the resulting explosions feed more CRF to the BLA, ramping the overload up in a ratcheting cascade of intense panic that finally flips all the breaker switches, resulting in shutdown. This is probably why my own meltdown tipped over into shutdown: I had been stressed for days with multiple meltdowns and my system just couldn\u2019t handle any more stimulation so it shut off to prevent my brain from frying itself. My brain crawled up inside its own virtual Faraday cage to wait things out. In the case of \u201cthe SD child,\u201d Miller and Loos observed that one shutdown would make her extra vulnerable to more shutdowns during the following three weeks. It takes that long for the BLA to \u201ccome back down\u201d from its hyperaroused state. It\u2019s pretty easy to see how quickly things can take a bad turn if the brain is not given time to heal. This is the low-detail version of why I have a medical discharge from the Navy and why I was able to hold\u00a0a series of\u00a0minimum-wage jobs before the military\u00a0but unable to get a job at all afterwards. When I signed up for the Navy, I didn\u2019t understand my neurology. It was a devastating blow to not only fail at boot camp but come out of it so debilitated I couldn\u2019t even keep a roof over my head any more. This is why I speak so strongly about helping Autistic children to build low-stress environments that nurture rather than damage their neurology. This is why I warn so often against shaming Autistics for not \u201cpushing the envelope\u201d the way you think they ought to instead of the way that protects them from damage. Of course it\u2019s healthy to step out of one\u2019s comfort zone from time to time. What you need to remember is that the entire world is outside of an Autistic\u2019s comfort zone. We live our whole\u00a0lives outside that zone. Please recognize and honor that. I just can\u2019t say that enough: we  are  trying and the obstacles can be as massive for us as they are invisible\u00a0to you. Treat shutdown\u00a0\u00a0as the medical situation it truly is. Help us get away from bright lights and loud noises. Help us find a quiet space to re-regulate our nervous system. And be gentle with us as we recover from a neurological episode, understanding how delicately balanced our brains are after\u00a0marinating in the biochemicals of\u00a0stress. We need support, not blame. We need peace and stress-relief, not punishment. And, always, we need love, understanding, and acceptance.

Copyright Sparrow R. Jones, 2017] Do you not realize that these are slurs along the lines of The R Word? Do you not realize that everything I have ever said about the R Word applies to the C word and the I word as well? Using words that describe vulnerable populations to describe the actions of those who are not members of that population who are engaging in behavior that displeases or distresses you is the verbal equivalent of picking up a disabled person to use them as a bludgeon. You\u2019re not likely to hurt your target but you are crushing those of us who become your lazy go-to when you can\u2019t find the words you really want. \u201cBut wait!\u201d someone always responds. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand! He really is crazy! He\u2019s got Narcissistic Personality Disorder! A psychology professor said so!\u201d First off, that professor was behaving unethically if they diagnosed Donald Trump without even meeting him. \u00a0There is a rule in the psychiatric professions called the  Goldwater Rule , so called because it arose after similar speculations were made about Goldwater. \u00a0Section 7.3 of the APA Code of Ethics says: On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement. That means that it is unethical for a professional to announce a diagnosis of Donald Trump. And if you are not a professional, you are not qualified to diagnose Donald Trump. \u00a0The only people qualified to determine if a person has a psychiatric disability are trained professionals and the individual themselves. \u00a0Furthermore,\u00a0revealing a person\u2019s diagnosis without their explicit permission is a violation of HIPAA regulations specifically and a violation of privacy in general. No one has the right to disclose another person\u2019s medical information without their consent. Secondly, if someone you view as having authority has told you that Donald Trump has Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) \u00a0(or if you have taken it upon yourself to \u00a0lay-diagnose him as such), you are wrong. \u00a0The doctor who wrote the diagnostic criteria for NPD \u00a0has publicly stated that Donald Trump does not meet the criteria. Dr. Frances goes a step further and explains why these casual lay-diagnoses of public figures are so harmful. You really should read his words:  This Doctor Nailed The Problem With Diagnosing Donald Trump With Mental Illness . I have even seen some people suggesting we \u201cpush for Trump to submit to psychiatric evaluation.\u201d \u00a0Forcing psychiatry on an unwilling person is the height of human rights violations. \u00a0I never thought I\u2019d find myself in the position of defending and protecting Donald Trump, but society has put me here by insisting that the basic human rights we hold so dear do not apply to him. Call him evil, call him authoritarian, call him a fascist \u2026. but do not suspend his human rights unless you are willing to see your own human rights suspended next. It is unethical to diagnose a person without an examination, regardless of credentials or lack thereof. It is a human rights violation to attempt to force a person to submit to psychiatry against their will. Some reading in the psychiatric survivor literature will help you to understand what a gross violation it is. Fighting dangerous leadership by weaponizing psychiatry against the president will only serve to hurt vulnerable Americans as those arrows will be twisted by the government\u00a0and turned against us. We already have a Vice President who supports the use of involuntary \u201canti gay therapy\u201d against minors. We do not need to use their evil tactics against them. We can fight evil\u00a0without becoming evil. Study authoritarian\u00a0regimes in other countries and other decades and you will see psychiatry repeatedly being weaponized against the resistance. \u00a0Audre Lord said \u201c the master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house. \u201d \u00a0Nick Walker brought that philosophy into the battle against the pathology paradigm with the essay \u201c Throw Away the Master\u2019s Tools .\u201d Authoritarian dictators are the ones who routinely weaponize psychiatry to silence the Resistance. Those aren\u2019t the tools we need to be using to dismantle the master\u2019s house.

I have also added a clarifying side note to make sure readers know that I do not believe any human being at all, ever, is a tragedy! [image description: A green bordered meme tile for #boycottautismspeaks and #PosAutive Action for Social Justice that quotes this essay, saying \u201cMy life is far too complex \u2014 and far too beautiful \u2014 to ever be mistaken for a tragedy.\u201d \u2013 Soarrow Rose Jones] Lately, the organization named Autism Speaks has worked really hard to provide me with that proof. Exhibit A:\u00a0 The\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCall to Action\u201d by Suzanne wright  (the co-founder of Autism Speaks) that\u00a0said that I\u00a0 and those like me are unspeakable horrors to our families who live in despair and depletion, ill and broken,\u00a0because we are so awful to cope with. Exhibit B: the latest documentary film from Autism Speaks, titled,  \u201cSounding the Alarm.\u201d  For an organization that tries to claim they are not alarmist, that is a pretty fishy film title, right? Those of you who have followed my blog for a while know that I was an incredibly difficult child to raise. I\u2019ll be honest: I pretty much did deplete my mother (although she has bounced back quite beautifully these days.) And you know I\u2019ve had a hard life, with bullying, abuse, poverty, homelessness, and chronic unemployment. But you know what else? I would estimate that 90% of my difficulties in life were not caused by being born Autistic \u2014 they were caused by other people not coping well with who I am. People who don\u2019t like the way I move, the way I speak, the things that catch my interest end up pushing me and bullying me and excluding me in ways that make my life miserable. Most of the \u201ctragedy\u201d of my life was completely avoidable if everyone around me had been encouraged to be a little more open-minded\u00a0and discover the incredibly loyal friend or the hard-working and dedicated employee behind the quirky behavior and different way of viewing the world. You see, my life only becomes a tragedy when someone else chooses to frame it that way. And that is objectifying toward me and people like me and I will explain to you why I feel that way. Human beings \u2014 at least those living in industrial \u201cWestern\u201d culture \u2014 have basically two ways to view lives. There\u00a0are lives, plain and simple. These are what they are living, what their friends and family are living. Regular lives\u00a0have ups and downs\u00a0and long, welcome stretches of \u201cboring\u201d everyday stuff. There is no overarching framework because they aren\u2019t stories; they are lives. Stories are the other way to view lives. We view imaginary lives that way all the time when we watch television and movies.\u00a0We also frame certain people\u2019s lives as stories when we write about real people in books or magazines. Stories\u00a0do not have long stretches of everyday \u201cboring\u201d regularity, because stories are about heroes and villains \u2014 stories are drama and drama is shaped by our theatrical forms that\u00a0box everything up as Comedy or Tragedy. You\u2019ve seen the masks, right? The iconic symbol of the theater with one mask laughing in hilarity and the other weeping openly. This is how we frame stories and this is why people who want to box me\u00a0up and objectify my life\u00a0so often strip all the complexity out of my \u201cstory\u201d and try to fit it into comedy (\u201clook at that ridiculous ******!!\u201d) or tragedy (\u201cPoor thing, he\u2019s so pitiful. It\u2019s inspirational to me that he even gets up every morning and goes on living day after day!\u201d) People who want my life to be a story and not just a life are required to objectify me and amputate most of my actual life to get the essence of me into that little box they need to put me in so they can make their point. Autism Speaks\u2019 point is that autism is evil, Autistic people are a tragedy, families of Autistic people are broken on the wheel of autism . . . oh, and give us lots of money. They try to claim that I can\u2019t be upset about the things they say because they aren\u2019t talking about me, they\u2019re talking about \u201cthose Autistics.\u201d You know, the cardboard cut-out caricatures of Ultimate Tragedy that never mature beyond infancy and thus grow up to be Useless Eaters and Burdens to Us All. I am \u201ctoo high functioning\u201d (meaning I continued to grow and develop and change throughout the course of my life and am now able to type words and lift a spoon to my mouth unassisted) and I am not who they\u00a0mean. (side note: No Autistic person at all ever is that reductionist tragedy. \u00a0We all grow and develop and strive to flourish in our lives. None of us are a one-dimensional tragedy, regardless of who we are and how our humanity manifests.) Well, if they aren\u2019t talking about me, they need to stop counting me in order to make their massive \u201ctsunami\u201d declarations of millions and millions of us who\u00a0are struggling and suffering\u00a0(unless you give lots of money to Autism Speaks, of course.\u00a0That will somehow magically stop our suffering . . . . well, no, it won\u2019t. So they need\u00a0you to\u00a0give them some more money. Don\u2019t stop yet! There are still MILLIONS AND MILLIONS of Autistics out there! Tragedy! Alarm! Crisis! Pandemic! . . .\u00a0keep that money coming.)\u00a0 If there are so many millions of us, then they *ARE* counting me and people like me so how dare they say I have no right to be distressed by their rhetoric about ME? Would you like to know how *I* read the story of my life? Sure, there are hard times. I struggle a lot. But I also accomplish and achieve a lot. I would like less struggle. I would like a\u00a0LOT less struggle. But I would not like no struggle at all, because having something to push against adds to my strength. I want to have some challenges so that I can have some accomplishments. I want to have some difficulties so that I can have some growth. As Robert Browning said, \u201ca man\u2019s reach should exceed his grasp\u201d. I would like my grasp to come a lot closer to my reach (wouldn\u2019t we all?) but I want there to always be something just brushing my fingertips, tempting me to press on. I never want to fulfill all my dreams, unless I grow new dreams in the meantime. I want there to always be someplace new to go, something new to strive for. I would like those things to be new skills, new arts, new travels and people. Right now, some of those ungrasped things are more fundamental. Right now, some of those ungrasped things are unmet needs, not unlived dreams. There are hard times and things I would like to improve, but that doesn\u2019t make my life a tragedy. If I had to define my life in one word, it would not be \u201ctragedy.\u201d It would be \u201cjoy.\u201d I have an abundance of joy in my life. I have always had joy in my life, even during the hard times. I believe I could be left sitting in a garbage heap and manage to find something beautiful there. Suzanne Wright painted her picture of what our lives are. Let me paint a few vignettes of\u00a0my own, one, single, Autistic life: It is summer and I am walking. The brush is scrubby and dry and tiny black-and-white checkered lizards bake in the sun on flat rocks. Raptors wheel high in the sky, nearly invisible against the glare of the sun. The trail I\u2019m on dips lower, into a grove of evergreens, and suddenly I am wrapped in the sound of scores of little birds, singing in the trees. A swarm of dragonflies seemingly materialize from nowhere and I stop walking, transfixed by the beauty of the sun glinting rainbow sparks from their diaphanous wings as they circle lazily around my head. I am tucked away in a dusty corner of the library, reading. What am I reading? It must be a comic book of some sort, because I read intently, then suddenly burst into laughter, nodding my head and shaking my hands with excitement and happiness. Then I go back to intently reading with furrowed brow before bursting again into childlike laughter. Curious to see what is causing such reactions in me, you draw nearer to discover that I am reading a collection of dozens of mathematical proofs of the Pythagorean theorem.\u00a0 That beautiful moment when all the pieces fall into place is so glorious and profound to me that I am helpless to do anything but laugh with delight when I get to that point in each mathematical proof. I\u00a0have a new musical instrument and I am exploring the sounds it makes. I am comparing it to every other type of instrument I have played before \u2014 and there are many \u2014 to see how it is similar and how it is different. Within five minutes, I play my first simple song. Within five days, I am playing as if I have\u00a0been working\u00a0with that instrument for months. I do the same things with languages \u2014 writing letters and poetry in grammatically correct\u00a0Swedish\u00a0three hours after I opened the parcel containing a Swedish-English dictionary and began studying the sentence structure of the language. I do the same thing with anything that is based on patterns because I am a pattern thinker. I do not think in words. I do not think in pictures. I think in\u00a0symbols and patterns. Any process or thing that succumbs naturally to pattern thinking is an easy delight for my pattern-seeking mind and heart. I am exhausted, so I lay down to listen to music and maybe sleep for a\u00a0couple of hours. My cat gets excited to see me recline because I am creating his favorite place in the whole world \u2014 I am becoming\u00a0his cat mattress. He runs to me and climbs on top and we adjust ourselves to find the spot of maximum comfort for both of us, the\u00a0two of us so in tune with one another that words are unnecessary. We go beyond communication; we commune. I wrap my arms around him and bury my face in his kitten-soft fur and he purrs and wraps\u00a0his\u00a0paws around my head. We lay there together, two souls breathing as one, rejuvenating each other with\u00a0the priceless love and trust\u00a0that connects our gentle spirits. This is my life. This is not\u00a0a tragedy. I am not a statistic. I am not a pawn to be used to\u00a0manipulate you into giving money to a charity that gives\u00a0about 4% of its income to actually helping Autistic people and our families and gives\u00a044% of its income to researching ways to wipe me and my kind off the face of the Earth. (And another 22% to fundraising efforts that paint us as a tragedy so that they can bring in more money to find more ways to create a world where people like me are extinct.) \u00a0 My life is not a tragedy. My life is far too complex \u2014 and far too beautiful \u2014 to ever be mistaken for a tragedy. This is why Autism Speaks does not speak for me. I am Autistic\u00a0and I can speak for myself. (And on those days when I can\u2019t, I can write for myself. And on the days when I can\u2019t even do that, I\u2019m still not a tragic pawn to be moved\u00a0across the board of someone else\u2019s political and financial agenda.) I am not a horror. I am not a destructive force. I am not a tsunami or an epidemic. I am a human being, living my complex, messy, sometimes boring, sometimes gloriously beautiful, everyday life. My life is not a tragedy. I am a human being and we are too complex to be reduced to such abject objects. See us . . . really see us. We are priceless beyond measure. We are not tragic. Please do not assist any person or organization in attempting to reduce our beautiful and complex lives to little more than a theatrical stage show. Our lives are not tragedies.

If you\u2019re lucky, people will have a little decency and put some ramps in front of government buildings or braille placards on elevators, but mostly you just have to accept that you\u2019re not normal and be grateful for what crumbs people toss your way.

Copyright 2016, Sparrow R. Jones] Autism does not reside in a medical report My corner of the conversation centered around the question of whether autism is a disability or not. The same person who stirred Sonia Boue to write the excellent post linked above got into it with one of my Twitter contacts on a different but related topic: [image description: A twitter exchange. Grit Tokley writes: \u201cI\u2019m well aware of the social model of disability, and I don\u2019t considering autism to be a disability in any sense, tyvm. @aspiemermaid\u201d Autistic Elf (Aspiemermaid) responds: \u201c@GritTokley ok. So why are you so hung up on getting it medically diagnosed?\u201d] Because, of course, the bulk of the following Twitter discussion centered around strong assertions that autism is not a disability, along with strong assertions that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and we must all agree to disagree. *sigh* So, with that. Three Models of Disability There are many different models of disability, but I would like to focus in on three of them as being the most mainstream and/or the most useful for various groups of people. The Medical Model of Disability This is the most mainstream model of disability and the one you\u2019re most likely to have seen before. One participant in the Twitter discussion shared this definition of disability that pretty well sums up the nicest version of the medical model you are ever likely to see: [image description: a white background with black text reading: \u201cDisability is an impairment that may be physical, cognitive, intellectual, mental, sensory, developmental, or some combination of these that results in restrictions on an individual\u2019s ability to participate in what is considered \u201cnormal\u201d in their everyday society.\u201d That\u2019s the medical model and that\u2019s why so many disabled people reject that definition of disability. But it\u2019s still a really popular definition. And, as the person who shared the image pointed out, by this definition, autism is quite clearly a disability. Something like 99.9% of the Autistics you will meet have at least one of some kind of sensory issue that makes life difficult if/when they encounter sensory assaults (or situations in which they require extra sensory stimulation in order to stay regulated.) By definition, we are developmentally disabled, whether you use the medical model\u2019s terminology (developmental delay) or recognize our development as being on a different trajectory from the mainstream. It\u2019s pretty clear that, within the medical model we are disabled. The Social Model of Disability This is the model I see most often in the Autistic activist community. The social model was developed in the 1970s by British disability theorists who did not appreciate the way the medical model dumps all responsibility for disability and accommodations thereof in the laps of disabled people. The social model was a great \u00a0improvement over the medical model, particularly in the area of human rights. The social model posits that disability does not actually exist. Those states of being that are labeled as \u201cdisability\u201d are natural variations in the human condition and all human beings require support and accommodation from society in order to survive. For example: you probably eat food that someone else grew, someone else processed and/or packaged, someone else drove to your region in \u00a0a truck using fuel gathered and processed by someone else, driving on roads built by others and paid for collectively through taxation. All of the steps and people required to get food to the supermarket, farmer\u2019s market, soup kitchen, restaurant, institutional kitchen or whatever location it is where you go to feed yourself are supports and accommodations that society approves of and works hard to keep in place. When the need is a mainstream one, the supports and accommodations are called \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d When the need is a divergent one, the supports and accommodations are called accessibility measures. According to the social model, \u201cdisability\u201d is a social construct and \u201cdisabled\u201d is what society is doing to you if it decides that the supports and accommodations you require are too much trouble and you are not worth the expenditure of time, energy, money, and other resources that would be required to make society accessible to someone like you. Within the social model of disability, Autistics are disabled (by a society that does not value Autistics sufficiently to support and accommodate us) but autism is not a disability because disability does not exist, being merely a social construct that makes it convenient for those who would like to disable us without feeling guilty about it. The Social-Relational Model of Disability Finally, we have my favorite model of disability, the social-relational model. \u00a0The social-relational model is less well-known, having only been developed in the 21st century, by disability theorist Solveig Reindal 1 . The need for the social-relational model was clear before Reindal wrote about it, though, and I\u2019ve also noticed some people who are unaware of Reindal\u2019s work trying to re-shape the social model into something closer to Reindal\u2019s vision, due to dissatisfaction with the social model. No need to re-shape the social model, though, when the social-relational model already exists. The major dissatisfaction activists and theorists were finding with the social model was that disabled people could not\u00a0 express any dissatisfaction with the experience of being disabled without being viewed as \u201ctraitors to the theory.\u201d 2 . Reindal\u2019s new formulation of the social-relational model moves to a third position in which society is still held accountable for disabling people but theory does not ignore the body or the real struggles some people have with disability, independent of society\u2019s support and accommodations or lack thereof. While the social model\u00a0claimed that disability does not exist, being purely a social construct evolving out of views of those constructed as disabled as being \u201clesser\u201d in some way, Reindal acknowledged that those who are identified as disabled do, indeed, have some type of impairment. These impairments \u2013 what the medical model calls \u201cdisability\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Reindal labeled as \u201cbarriers to doing.\u201d \u00a0In contrast to impairment, Reindal writes about \u201cbeing disabled\u201d\u00a0as it is defined by the social model as the \u201cbarrier to being,\u201d suggesting that the social constructs that view those with impairments as lesser beings, not worthy of inclusion or accommodation, creates an existential crisis that extends deeply into the disabled person\u2019s core being.\u00a0 Within the social-relational model, I have impairments (although not all Autistics have social-relational impairments, according to what others have told me) and I am disabled by society\u2019s lack of support and accommodation for my needs. I have a disability and I am disabled. I have barriers to doing, which I find frustrating, and I have barriers to being, which I find devastating. Why Is All This Important? If you have read this far, you may be asking yourself why any of this matters. As an old friend used to say, \u201chow will this help me shop for groceries?\u201d This is important because these are not just words and theories. This is important because these different frameworks for viewing people\u2019s lives are the structures that underlie how we are treated, what assistance we get or do not get, even whether people feel we have sufficient humanity and \u201cquality of life\u201d to deserve to continue living. It is very important to understand these seemingly academic topics, because these sorts of thoughts are beneath the doctors\u2019 attempts to deny Mel Baggs a feeding tube to keep Mel alive. These thoughts are behind the choice of those administering the transplant registries to deny Paul Corby a spot on the heart transplant list. These questions and ideas and words are not just exercises in navel-gazing. They are the basis upon which life-or-death decisions are made about us. Too often these decisions are made without us, because the operating definition of disability/disabled is one that places us in an infantilized position where we are not considered able even to advocate for ourselves 3 . When I turned to my Facebook friends and asked how they felt about the question of whether autism is a disability or not, I got an overwhelming flood of responses \u2014\u00a0there were over 200 responses to the question. That discussion really helped me in shaping my thoughts about the rather distressing day I had on Twitter and the nature of disability/being disabled. Two comments in particular resonated very strongly with me. I found them both thought-provoking and comforting after all the Twitter distress. Cas Faulds  said: \u201cour current society and our current systems means that we are disabled and if we\u2019re working under the impression that we aren\u2019t, we\u2019re setting ourselves up for failure.\u201d That\u2019s very important. Denying that we are disabled (which I see a lot of Autistics doing these days) runs the risk of setting ourselves up for failure when we decide that there is no real difference between Autistic and non-autistic. This opens the door for the struggle I\u2019ve faced most of my life, believing I kept failing because I just wasn\u2019t trying hard enough. Understanding that I am disabled has helped me to forgive myself for those very real things I just can\u2019t do \u2014 whether due to inherent impairment or being disabled by society. No matter how \u201cdisabled\u201d is philosophically constructed, I am definitely disabled and acknowledging that fact gives me the space to re-frame situations and figure out accommodations, whether self-accommodations or accommodations I request from others. My friend, Chris, \u00a0said: \u201cthere\u2019s an immense spectrum, from not disabling to severely disabling, and someone pretending their end is the only one that should be called \u201cautism\u201d \u2014 well that\u2019s pinging ME really hard as supremacism.\u201d Yes! The people who kept telling me that autism is not a disability and Autistics are not disabled said that I would hurt the image of autism by insisting that it is a disability or that Autistics are disabled. I felt very excluded and erased because I am quite disabled. When the discussion was framed in terms of division and supremacism, the first thing I thought of was  Michael John Carley\u2019s distress  about dropping Asperger\u2019s from the DSM because he didn\u2019t want to be mistaken for someone with more challenges. The people on Twitter might be right. It might just be a matter of opinion. It might be that autism is not a disability (\u201cbut you can call yourself disabled if you want to.\u201d) It might be that we should just all \u201cagree to disagree.\u201d But I think we should tread carefully on declaring that autism is not a disability when there are so many of us who are so very clearly disabled., regardless of which model of disability one chooses. I know that I would rather be mistaken for \u201csomebody who might have to wear adult diapers and maybe a head-restraining device\u201d (to quote Carley) than throw my Autistic siblings under a philosophical bus because my support needs are different from theirs. So\u2026.my stance? Autism is a disability. Autistics are disabled. Society needs to work harder to support and accommodate us all, in all our variety, with all our different types and levels of support needs. We are human beings, expressing part of the infinite diversity humans express in infinite combinations. Accept us. Support us. Value us. The fact that we are disabled only means that society needs to think more carefully and work more diligently to craft an accessible world we all can live in, together. 1.

[image description: a black and white photo of a transmasculine person snuggled in his sleeping bag on a cold morning, interacting with his cat who is also snuggled against the chill. Photo copyright 2016 Sparrow R. Jones] Oh, I am a self-advocate in that I seek to fill my needs and (most of the time) am able to ask others to help me get what I need. I am a self-advocate in the sense that is usually meant when goals are set for an Autistic that include the goal of helping the Autistic person learn to navigate systems, ask for what they need, explain their autism to others, and so forth. There is nothing wrong with self-advocacy and I strive to be a self-advocate and to encourage others to do the same. But self-advocate is not my self-identity. I am an advocate. I am an activist. And so are most of the Autistics I notice being called \u2014 or calling themselves \u2014 self-advocates. I\u2019m not writing to try to tell others how to self-identify. I believe everyone should have the autonomy to self-identify as they see best and the rest of us owe them the respect of calling them what they have identified themselves to be. It is a cornerstone of human dignity to be able to say, \u201cI am this,\u201d and have others respect you as such. I will cheerfully call anyone a self-advocate who chooses to identify as a self-advocate. And I don\u2019t judge or seek to diminish those who choose that identity to describe the outreach they do. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s not my identity. I do think I understand how this term came to be so widely used. Our allistic (not autistic) allies were advocating for us (the best ones were doing so by doing what Kassiane calls  \u201csignal boosting\u201d \u2014 that is, repeating our message for those who will only hear the words if they come from someone of a different neurotype) and so they came to be called \u201cadvocates.\u201d Someone noticed that Autistic people were advocating as well and they decided there should be a special word so people knew that the words (or art, or music, or performance) were coming from an Autistic person themselves. Digging into the pre-existing autism terms, they came up with self-advocate and ran with it. The problem is the term is dismissive. It is demeaning. It is en-small-ing. It is  infantilizing . And it is wrong \u2014 we are advocates, not self-advocates, when we do and say the things we do and say to try to make the world a better place for all Autistics. That\u2019s the key there: all Autistics. We are not self-advocating; we are advocating for our entire tribe. It shouldn\u2019t even feel natural to call us self-advocates when we come forth to speak and write about how Autistics are treated, what Autistics need, what Autistics deserve. I ask you this: do all of these sentences sound natural and right to you? \n The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an important African-American self-advocate. \n When Rosa Parks refused to sit at the back of the bus, she was engaging in a bold act of self-advocacy. \n During Vietnam, Buddhist monks became self-advocates by setting themselves on fire. \n The SDS was a student-run organization of political self-advocates. \n The National Organization of Women regularly engages in self-advocacy surrounding issues of importance to women. \n Do you begin to sense why I have issues with the term \u201cself-advocate?\u201d When I started Googling to see if I could find other Autistics who were not pleased with the label \u201cself-advocate,\u201d I was not surprised to see that I am not the first person to take issue with this label. The first page I found belongs to  Corina Lynn Becker , who writes, \u201cIn my opinion, self-advocacy is asking for a glass of water. This is not what I do. I am not asking for my human rights; I am demanding them, not only for myself, but for the rest of my community.\u201d When we are called self-advocates, it is easy to ignore what we say about the current generation of children who are growing up Autistic. \u201coh, she says some very important, provocative things! But my child is different. My child will never speak or drive a car or get married. She is not talking about my child; she is a SELF-advocate.\u201d No, we adult Autistic advocate are not like your child. We are not like your child because we are not children; we are adults! You cannot automatically tell what our childhoods were like by just looking at us or hearing us or reading our writing. Calling us self-advocates is the easiest way to disregard something you don\u2019t even know. When we are called self-advocates, it underlines the  myth that we have no empathy  by positing us as activists who are only advocating for ourselves. Because how could an Autistic advocate for other Autistics? Without empathy, we must only care about our own personal situation, and especially not the lot of those we will never meet. (That, in case you didn\u2019t realize, was sarcasm.) Sure, I write about myself. I write about myself a lot. But my stories are offered up as case studies, as examples. I advocate more for other Autistics than I do for myself. When I first re-opened this blog, I wasn\u2019t sure what my focus was. Over time, my focus has become very clear to me and it is to do whatever I can to protect the children and to help them grow up strong and free with happier childhoods than I was able to have and healthier adulthoods than I have ended up with. I don\u2019t write to change my world. I doubt that much of what I write can change my world. My chance has come and gone; I write to change the children\u2019s world and to do what I can to build a better future for autism and for the Autistic. This is not self-advocacy. This is activism. Another Autistic I found writing against the idea of being called a self-advocate when one is actually reaching out in advocacy for all Autistics is Neurodivergent K.  She writes:  \u201cAllistic, enabled people are considered the default for anything and everything, so when someone like me-autistic, disabled-does something on my own behalf like every other adult in the world it\u2019s seen as so damn special and cutesy that they decide they need another word for it. A word, I may add, that implies that what I have to say is not as important as what \u201creal\u201d advocates have to say. I\u2019m just talking about myself, you see. They\u2019re doing the really real work, for we need the great allistic savior! We\u2019re cast as sidekicks in our own movement.\u201d K suggests that it is the allistic advocates who need the special term, not us Autistics. She says they can be allies or parent-advocates while we take back the word \u201cadvocate\u201d for ourselves. I agree with her. Or just call us all advocates, for that matter, because why does there even need to be a separation? If we are all doing battle to improve conditions for Autistics (and have no doubt that if we improve the world for us, it will improve for everyone. This is how it has always gone in the past when an oppressed group finally won the fight to be viewed as fully human beings) then we don\u2019t even need an \u201cus vs. them.\u201d We are all advocates. We are all activists. We are all struggling to be part of the solution. \u00a0 Important conversation on this topic moved from the old blog: \n Posted by  chavisory  on February 11, 2013 at 10:36 am\u00a0 \n \n I\u2019ve always been uneasy with the term and couldn\u2019t really put my finger on why\u2026this post captures some of it. There\u2019s an implied condescension\u2026indeed, like we aren\u2019t the \u201creal\u201d advocates. And it creates an illusion wherein a lot of parents can think \u201cMy child can\u2019t self-advocate because she can\u2019t write like these people can, so these autistics are a fundamentally different group of people who have nothing to do with my child\u2019s needs and I don\u2019t have to listen to them.\u201d \n And also I agree that I\u2019m not primarily advocating for myself\u2013I have an education, I have control over my own life, I\u2019ve more or less successfully carved a little niche in the world for myself\u2013I\u2019m standing up for other autistic and neurodivergent people to be treated with respect and acceptance, and for other children today to be thought of as capable and having rights and as being future adults and not eternal children. \n What I think of as \u201cself-advocacy,\u201d when I was a kid was just called \u201cstanding up for yourself.\u201d Funnily enough, no one liked it when I did it back then, either. \n \n Posted by Zr on February 12, 2013 at 10:20 am\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Apparently, \nAutistic people are \u201cself advocates\u201d, Neurotypical people are \u201cadvocates\u201d. \nAutistic people have \u201cspecial interests\u201d, Neurotypical people have \u201cinterests\u201d. \nAutistic people have \u201cspecial needs\u201d, Neurotypical people have \u201cneeds\u201d. \nAutistic people have \u201csplinter skills\u201d, Neurotypical people have \u201cskills\u201d. \nRegardless if it\u2019s the same thing(s) in both cases. \nMadness. \n \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/dont-call-me-a-self-advocate/", "title": "Don\u2019t Call Me a Self-Advocate"},

Photo copyright 2016, Sparrow R. Jones] But now something I\u2019ve written has actually gone genuinely viral and it was so upsetting I didn\u2019t get out of bed for two days. What? (I\u2019m imagining you\u2019re saying that as you read this) I thought you wanted your words to go viral? Why are you so upset? Yeah\u2026see\u2026every time I thought about my words going viral or watched my numbers rise higher than they had before, those were my carefully crafted words that I had composed and published intentionally, with my name on them, wanting the world to read them and pass them around as much as possible. But my words went viral in November without me. They left without my permission and without my name. They were not my carefully crafted words, meant for the world to see and ponder, reflect on and discuss, grow inspired by and feel moved to take action as a result of reading. They were angry words dashed out with little heed for grammar, spelling, gravitas or the carefully balanced triad of ethos, pathos and logos I strive for in my formal work. An angry note I shot at a family member in the middle of a heated argument over the outcome of the presidential election \u2014 a note filled with all the adrenaline and rage of decades of family skeletons tumbling out of the closet into a clattering heap of bones on the floor at our feet \u2014 was what ended up all over Facebook, Tumblr, Reddit, the XKCD reader forum, YouTube video descriptions, meme graphic generation sites\u2026..everywhere. I am conflicted about my name having been removed. They were words never intended for the larger world and they were words of anger, a tormented howl of anguish. But they were mine. I reject them and I mourn my name being stripped from them. They were not my carefully crafted, painstakingly polished words, but the power they carry comes from years of work and practice, writing thousands of words every day, honing my craft, finding my voice. They were angry pencil jabs ripping through the paper, but they were mine and carried fruits of all my years of efforts off into the void where several other people grabbed hold of them and put their names on them. As much as it hurt seeing my words running around without me, it made me want to hurt someone else, seeing my words with a stranger\u2019s byline. I tracked down one of the strangers. She was hateful and admitted she had put her name on someone else\u2019s words and suggested I sue her before blocking me. In attempting to track down another stranger, I encountered someone who had shared the words who I ended up blocking because she kept insisting I seek therapy. I\u2019ll be the first to admit I\u2019m pretty unbalanced these days, but I was not looking for life advice, just playing detective on how the words spread. In part, I wanted to find the plagiarists who were so bold as to claim someone else\u2019s words as their own and I wanted to ask them to explain the reasoning behind their choice. (As if I were expecting reason and logic from Thought Thieves?) \u00a0But in larger part I ached to know how my words ran away from me like that. How did a family argument that ended up with most of my family blocked on Facebook and the rest painful to even think about, let alone consider interacting with ever again \u2026 how did that turn into a run-away viral meme? I will never know. Part of healing from the experience was admitting that I would never know and being willing to consciously let it all go, bid my words farewell, know that there are more words \u2014 there will always be more words \u2014 and focus on continuing on my journey, leaving my misbegotten words to work whatever dharma they might be working. \u201cYou should turn those words into a op-ed piece and present it to the Washington Post and The New York Times, etc. Don\u2019t worry about the Facebook crap. Take your words to a larger audience,\u201d a stranger told me when I was struggling to track down who and how my words had gotten away from me. \u201cFight back. Get it published in a newspaper where millions will read them. Your words have power. You can use them to affect many readers. I was impressed by what you wrote and I don\u2019t impress easily. Your words struck a deep chord in everyone who read it.\u201d Yes\u2026.I understand. That\u2019s why words go viral in the first place. They touch a nerve in others. I had really hoped that I could develop enough skill as a writer\u00a0to do that intentionally. I have beaten myself up over this, bitterly suggesting to myself that I should only write after getting myself really riled up first. If it takes being flooded with adrenaline to produce writing that people love enough to steal, maybe I should just live in an out of control emotional frenzy so I can create more words that will move so many people so deeply. But that\u2019s an painfully angry non-solution and I know it. Spending so much of my time in such a worked-up state would send me to jail, the madhouse, an early grave \u2014 possibly all of the above, each in turn. I feel isolated. Not only was my name removed from my words \u2014 something that feels like having my identity stripped away, strange though that comparison might sound to others \u2014 but I feel like no one else on the face of the Earth understands why it affected me so deeply that I took to my bed for two days to recover. I feel completely alien and frequently foolish as I listen to others attempt to mirror my pain back at me only to reveal that they have utterly failed to understand why this event has struck such a blow that I sank into a pit of despair and (temporary) loss of creativity. I am proud of my words. I am ashamed of my words. I am angry that strangers are claiming credit for my words. I am relieved that I am not being passed around the internet as \u201cthat angry person\u201d or worse. More people have found my words moving than I\u2019ve ever experienced before and I feel more isolated from the human species than ever before. And that is what it felt like (and in painful moments, still feels like) when my words went viral without me.

Photograph copyright 2016 Sparrow R. Jones] You have been weighed down for too long with cares and concerns. Your body has been heavy with worries for the future and your heart races with fear. You feel like you are clinging to a cliff and your fingernails will give way any moment. You just can\u2019t see how anything will end well. I\u2019ve been there. And I\u2019m not talking about the distant past. It\u2019s a cold, dark pond I go wading in on a regular basis, this murky fear and muddled worry. The things that weigh my limbs down, paralyzing me with fear, might be different from the things you are being dragged under by, but we both know that pond pretty well, right? But I want you to be happy. I want us both to be happy. I want all of us to be happy. That\u2019s part of why I\u2019m still here, treading water. I know I can help if I can just keep my own head above the surface long enough. I know I can help you be happy. And if I succeed, I know it will help me to be happy, too. But what is this happiness I\u2019m talking about? I see a lot of cynics shooting down the very idea of happiness as some kind of bliss-ninny fantasy completely divorced from reality. \u201cI don\u2019t go around grinning all the time. Happiness is a lie,\u201d they say. \u201cBeing pleased with my work is the best thing I could hope for. I hate the word happy because it\u2019s just an illusion to dangle in front of people to try to control them.\u201d \u201cHappy? That\u2019s some future that will never come. Don\u2019t talk to me about happiness.\u201d It took me a long time, myself, to understand what I mean when I say happy. I haven\u2019t had a lot of happiness in my life, so even understanding what it is has been a challenge for me. I was born into a family that had already established a long history of abuse before I ever hit the scene. I was hit, insulted, set up, molested, kicked, and hit some more. I was blamed for everything that went wrong in my life, including those things other people chose to do to me. Less than a decade into life, I watched my brother lose his battle with cancer. Many more years of sexual and physical abuse followed me out of the family home and years of homelessness were capped by watching my daughter die the day she was born. By that point, life had been so hard for so long that I wondered if she weren\u2019t the luckiest one of us all, getting to take a pass from the mire we all work so hard not to drown in. Life is still hard for me. I am houseless \u2014 I would call it homeless, but I made a conscious decision to live in my minivan and I prefer to save the word \u2018homeless\u2019 for those who didn\u2019t ask for the burden and are treading water harder than most of the rest of us because they ended up in such dire straits. I am poor, but I am slowly building income from my work and hope some day to be completely self-supporting. In the meantime, I am so grateful for the SSI benefits that keep me alive and above the waterline. I am lonely, but again that is by choice. I wanted to be able to travel around to try to spread a message of love and autism acceptance far and wide. Loneliness is just part of the ticket cost of this glorious ride. But I am beginning to see happiness and just starting to understand what it\u2019s made of \u2014 for me, anyway \u2014 and I am learning that it is not some kind of constant overwhelming joy or even a huge grin. It\u2019s something deeper and more solid than ephemeral emotions that drift across the surface of my being like stormy waves or sunny seas. When I talk about happiness, I\u2019m talking about something deeper than being pleased at a pretty birthday cake or excited to see a loved one again. I\u2019ve come to a point where I no longer even think of happiness as an emotion. When I was seventeen, I landed in a mental hospital for a time. While I was there, a family friend gave me two books to try to help me sort things out. One was a Thomas Merton book and it was interesting and soothing. But the other, an Alan Watts book, went straight to my bones. Since that time, I return to Alan Watts regularly. He barely had his own life together at all \u2014 many would say he didn\u2019t have his life together whatsoever. He was a lifelong alcoholic who died at the relatively young age of 58, most likely from a heart condition and the complications of alcoholic excess. Alan Watts is what Jungian thought calls a wounded healer. The ultimate wounded healer in mythology was Chiron, the centaur who received a fatal wound from a poisoned arrow but, being immortal, could not die. Instead, he suffered tremendously and, unable to heal himself, gave up his immortality and died. Zeus could not allow such a healing teacher to pass away from the world entirely and so promised that as long as Chiron\u2019s wisdom is needed, his teaching will live on. Alan Watts is a Chiron for me. I was only six years old when Watts died, but he left behind words that still teach me about life. Listen to what Watts says about happiness: I have found happiness in vocation. Watts talks about finding that thing that is yours to do, \u201cbecause you would do that thing whether it paid you very much or whether it didn\u2019t. Because that\u2019s the one thing you have to do.\u201d For me, happiness is not about smiles or laughter or excitement. Happiness is about having finally found the place I am supposed to be and the thing I am supposed to do \u2014 the thing I could not stop doing. As Watts says, \u201cI am a writer; I have to write, whether it makes me money or whether it doesn\u2019t, I would still have to be a writer.\u201d Happiness comes from doing what one is shaped to do and could not do otherwise. Happiness comes from being that which is inevitable. I see this in some of the parents I know. They are very clearly living their dharma by growing strong children into adults who do not doubt their inalienable right to exist and thrive, to love and be loved. Although the bills weigh heavily and the future looms and they are not sure how their child will continue to live and eat when they have shuffled off this mortal coil, they are living their dharma and they are happy. They are focused and they are doing exactly what is theirs to do. The Autistic Happiness Project  is not about birthday parties with ponies and balloons. It is about this happiness of dharma \u2014 the happiness that comes when every Autistic feels to their core that they are where they should be. That means the Autistic Happiness Project is as well-suited for fighting depression, abuse, and injustice as it is for celebrating the beauty of infinite human diversity in infinite combinations. I want you to be happy. I want you to feel your immeasurable worth. I want your feet to be firmly rooted in the unshakeable confidence of your place in this world. I want you to find your dharma and become so immersed in it that hours pass like minutes. Does happiness mean you will never again feel the cold water closing around you? No, because finding your place in the world does not make the world go away. But a deeply-rooted happiness will remind you why you keep treading water. A strong and solid happiness will feed your will to keep swimming, even when it seems the shore is receding. This is what my happiness gives to me: a determination to keep dog paddling through the darkness because I need to continue doing that thing I am shaped to do. My dharma awaits on the shore and that keeps my head up and my limbs moving. That is what happiness means to me. I want you to be happy.

Jones] I\u2019ve seen that argument, or some variation on it, so many times over the years. The argument is incorrect because it comes from not understanding what is meant when someone talks about \u201cwhite privilege\u201d or just \u201cprivilege.\u201d For starters, the word \u201cprivilege\u201d means an advantage and most people don\u2019t feel like they have much advantage in life. \u201cMembership has its privileges\u201d \u201che\u2019s a privileged character.\u201d People think of the word \u201cprivilege\u201d as something that means you were \u2018born with a silver spoon in your mouth.\u2019 Yes, that is one definition of privilege, but when the word is being used to talk about social issues, it just means a specific edge, often (but not always) brought about through society\u2019s stigmatized view of different types of people. If you don\u2019t belong\u00a0to one of the groups of people who are especially looked down on, hated, and/or feared you have privilege\u2026at least in that area of your life. It doesn\u2019t have to be a huge edge. Privilege is not an absolute and it\u00a0is not like an on/off switch where you\u2019re either a millionaire or a skid-row bum. But there\u2019s something even more important than the amount of any specific type of privilege you have: the interaction between different amounts of privilege or lack of privilege in your life. Let me talk about something that might (or might not) be\u00a0a new word for you:  intersectionality . Yes, it\u2019s one of those academic words. But I\u2019m going to break it down now and hopefully it will help you understand how you can be down on your luck or\u00a0even at the bottom-of-the-barrel and still have some kinds of privilege. Every single one of us is the result of intersections (combinations/interactions) of many different personal identities. \u00a0For example, here are some of my identities: \n white \n female at birth \n transgender/transmasculine \n alternate sexuality (very complicated to explain. Let\u2019s just call it grey asexual for now.) \n Autistic \n multiply physically disabled \n not mobility impaired/not a wheelchair user \n multiply neurodivergent/neurologically disabled (N24 in addition to autism) \n psychologically disabled (C-PTSD, Anxiety, Depression) \n middle-class upbringing (college-educated parents, good childhood nutrition, etc.) \n highly educated (both self-educated and at university) \n poor/homeless \n middle-aged \n Each of those identities has a different amount of privilege or lack of privilege. Let me draw you a picture of my own intersectionality. I have way too many identities to put them all in one diagram, so I\u2019m just going to talk about\u00a0four of them in this diagram: [image description: a drawing of four circles that overlap. On the edges, each of those four circles is labeled: \u2018WHITE\u2019, \u2018AUTISTIC\u2019, \u2018HOMELESS\u2019, \u2018EDUCATED\u2019. In the center, where all four identity circles overlap, is the word \u2018SPARROW\u2019.] This diagram illustrates four of those identities I listed above: white, Autistic, homeless, and educated. I put my name in the center where all the circles overlap, to show that I am a combination of those identities. If you take one of them away, I\u2019m no longer the Sparrow you see before you today. When you look at my privilege this way, you can see that my white privilege is not the whole story. Way out there on the edge where I am nothing but a white person, there is a lot of privilege. The place where the race circle overlaps with the circle indicating that I\u2019m highly educated is a space with a huge amount of privilege. My education represents multiple layers of privilege, starting with my birth into a middle-class family with two parents who had been to college. I grew up learning things from my parents because they are also highly educated. Growing up in that family also meant I got good nutrition in childhood to help my body grow strong. I got to travel on vacations and have broadening experiences in places other than the neighborhood and community where I grew up. I lived in safe neighborhoods with good schools. I was able to go to university and earn degrees because of many intersecting (there\u2019s that word again) privileges that go all the way back to my childhood. The good nutrition and intellectual stimulation as a child helped my brain to grow in ways that made it easier for me to educate myself. There\u2019s a massive amount of privilege contained in the intersection of those two identities: white and educated. But what about those other two circles? I am poor and homeless and that often makes me life very difficult. This week I have been going around to places like the Salvation Army, trying to find enough food to keep myself alive until I can either get paid for some of my writing or my next disability check comes in \u2014 and I am currently very worried about my disability income because I\u2019m up for re-certification and I filled out the paperwork today and it doesn\u2019t look good. If I lose my SSI disability, I have no idea how I will be able to hold my life together at all. That\u2019s not privilege, right? My homelessness and poverty are the opposite of privilege. A lot of my humanity doesn\u2019t matter to a lot of people in this world if I can\u2019t pay bills or afford the basics of life. And I am Autistic, as you likely know since this is a blog where I focus on Autistic issues and talk about my lived experience of autism. There is a lot of stigma connected to being known to be Autistic. A lot of people refuse to listen to anything I have to say. A lot of people value what non-autistic people say about autism much more highly than what those of us who live Autistic have to say about it, even when we\u2019re saying the same thing. Most especially when our lived experience is not what the non-autistic experts say it is. When you look at the space where Autistic and homeless overlap, you realize there is a huge lack of privilege there. Often I need things because I\u2019m homeless that I can\u2019t get because I\u2019m Autistic. Or I need things because I\u2019m Autistic that I can\u2019t get because I\u2019m homeless. My medical care is deeply substandard because of this intersection of lack of privilege. I have a lot of struggles with trying to build a career (ironically, since I chose to become homeless because it was the only way someone at my extremely low income-level could do the work I now do.) But here\u2019s the thing about intersectionality: that intersection of poverty and homelessness and being Autistic does not erase that intersection of being white and highly educated. I am still privileged at the same time that I am not privileged. I know, right? It can get confusing. But the thing about intersectionality is that I am not just one or two of those intersections of identity but I am all the intersections. When I am struggling to get my healthcare needs met because I am Autistic and homeless, I have an advantage over many other homeless Autistics because I am also white and highly educated. So there are doors that I can open with my privilege even though I am also a marginalized person. Last summer, I was camping at a free equestrian camp in northern Missouri. There are a ton of those free camps scattered all across the northern part of the state\u2026so many, in fact, that I counted and saw that a person could live for a full year for free, moving from horse camp to horse camp and staying a week at each one, without ever staying at the same camp twice. They are fairly primitive camping spots because they\u2019re mostly there so that people with horses have someplace to go ride them. My campsite on that particular evening had a fire ring and a picnic table, plus the site had a dumpster and a vault toilet (a big outhouse, basically.) There was no running water, no electricity\u2026and no people. I had a great time there because I was alone for most of that week. Someone parked near me for a few hours to take their horse out of a trailer and ride him around and then left. I really enjoyed the solitude. One night, a police officer pulled up to my campsite. He asked me if I had heard gunshots. I answered honestly that I had not, and that I had been in my van for the last hour, so I wouldn\u2019t have heard them anyway. I have no idea if there were really gunshots or if that was just his way of opening a conversation with me. He asked me what I was doing and he was pretty friendly about it. I told him the truth: I was on my way to spend the Fourth of July holiday with family but, \u201cyou know how it is: I don\u2019t want to show up so early that they\u2019re tired of me before the holiday even starts! So I figured I\u2019d spend a little time camping. Really nice campsite you\u2019ve got here!\u201d He laughed with me about the idea of imposing one\u2019s self on family too long and agreed that Missouri sure was pretty. Satisfied that I hadn\u2019t decided to permanently move in and that I seemed to be just an innocent traveler, and not up to no good, he wished me a good evening and left. After the officer left, I wondered how that encounter would have gone if I were Black. Would he have been so quick with the friendly banter? Would he have been so quick to decide it was okay for me to camp there? What if I were \u00a0not from a highly educated middle-class family? The words that come out of my mouth tell people that I come from a particular background and many people respect me when I am speaking well. What if my stress levels and anxiety \u00a0had been so high that my Autistic tendency to lose speech in difficult times had kicked in and I wasn\u2019t able to speak smoothly with him? What if I had been in one of my moments where I can\u2019t speak at all and had to type my half of the conversation to him on my AAC device? This is intersectionality of privilege: the way I was treated by that police officer showed me that he was seeing my privilege and feeling comfortable about me because of it. I could easily have been in a situation where he mainly saw my lack of privilege and felt concerned about my presence at the campsite, wanting to chase me out of his county or put me in his jail or take me to a mental hospital. And if I had been a different person \u2014 perhaps one who had a harder time hiding my lack of privilege\u2026say because it was predicated on my dark skin color that I could not hide from him no matter what \u2026 it is anyone\u2019s guess how that interaction would have gone. This is why we talk so much about white privilege when we discuss privilege, even though there are so many different kinds of privilege. Being Black is something a person can\u2019t turn on and off, can\u2019t disguise, can\u2019t just keep their mouth shut about, can\u2019t see a voice coach to learn how to obscure it. Black is Black, no matter what. And that\u2019s a great thing, and something to be pleased and proud of\u2026but it\u2019s also a facet of a person\u2019s identity that means they have to be careful with every single life choice. Being Black is a facet of a person\u2019s identity that means they live with a target on their back every day, every moment. The wrong word, the wrong movement, going to the wrong place, wearing the wrong clothes, walking home the wrong way on a dark rainy night with your hood up to keep the rain off your head \u2026 every single thing that Black people do or say can put them at risk because Blackness is the first thing that people see about them and people make judgments and decisions based on that. And that is why white privilege is such a huge thing, even for someone like me who is poor, hungry, homeless, multiply disabled, struggling to get by with anxiety and PTSD and a history of abuse and institutionalization. The cards are stacked against me\u2026but my skin is white and my words, when they are working for me, instantly reveal my level of education and privilege and that has kept me alive against the odds for fifty years. The next time you see someone talking about privilege and you feel angry or ashamed and want to reject the idea that you have privilege? Don\u2019t. Accept that you have privilege. Admit it. Own it. Privilege is not something to be ashamed of. Most of us didn\u2019t even ask for the privileges we have; we were just born that way or born into an environment that was aimed toward shaping us that way. \u201cCheck your privilege\u201d doesn\u2019t mean to be ashamed of what you have or of the advantages it gives you. Being asked to check your privilege just means that you should stop to think about the things that seem easy for you and remember that they are not easy for everyone. You may make phone calls with barely any effort, but it can be hell for me and impossible for someone else. I can drive really well: I\u2019ve driven 31,000 miles in the last 18 months and have only put a few light scuffs on the car in the process (that one-lane tunnel in Indiana was  way  too narrow, I swear to you!) Not everyone can drive so well or even at all. I\u2019d go so far as to say that at least half of my friends cannot drive at all. Maybe even more than half of them. I am not ashamed that I can drive, but it is important that I check my privilege and remember that it\u2019s not something everyone can do (and there\u2019s no shame in  not  being able to drive, either!) If you feel like people want you to feel guilty for being white, stop and ask yourself if you are projecting your own feelings onto them. I have been told to check my white privilege a lot of times and I have never felt like someone wanted me to be ashamed of being white (or of having any sort of privilege). Being ashamed of being white (or privileged in any other way) accomplishes nothing! If you are having a hard time getting past that feeling, though, it can be very therapeutic to use your privilege to help break down the barriers that other people face. Here are some suggestions of ways to use your privilege for the benefit of marginalized people: Seven ways  to use your cisgender privilege (the privilege of being born the sex/gender you identify as being) to help transgender people. Four ways  to \u201cpush back\u201d against your privilege (of any type) and help marginalized people. What to do  instead of just feeling guilty about it once you realize you have privilege in some area of your life. Five ways  to use your privilege to fight anti-Black racism. And, just for good measure, a white cis man explains why\u00a0 wearing a safety pin is not enough . So don\u2019t resent it when someone lets you know about your privilege. They are helping you to understand yourself better. You are not supposed to feel ashamed. Someone said, \u201cpeople tell me to check my privilege to get me to shut up\u201d and that\u2019s kind of true. Because as some of those links I just gave you will remind you, when someone reminds you of your privilege that\u2019s the time to stop talking, start listening, and learn about the realities of someone else\u2019s life. I have learned so much when I have listened to my Black friends, my Latinx friends, friends who are trans women, friends with psychiatric disabilities I don\u2019t have, friends with other disabilities I don\u2019t live with, immigrant friends, friends much older or much younger than me. I have learned so much when I let people tell me about the marginalized aspects of their lives. When someone helps me check my privilege, they are doing me a favor. It might sting in the short term, but I benefit so much in the long run. We all benefit from understanding the realities of the lives of people who are not the same as us. And we all benefit from increasing access for everyone and working to build a world that is more understanding, more fair, has more opportunities and less stigma and bigotry. Do you have privilege? Probably, yes. Most people have some amount of privilege and some amount of lack of privilege. It\u2019s not a contest and it\u2019s not a zero sum game. Don\u2019t get caught up in trying to calculate how much privilege you do or don\u2019t have. Accept that you have some privilege and do what you can to help marginalized people (including yourself, if you are marginalized in aspects\u00a0of your life) get heard and respected. We are stronger together, all of us. Check your privilege and then use that privilege as a force for good in the world.

Photo credit: Dr. Evelyn Chiang] Disability is Diversity Week content warning: mention of suicide Thank you for having me here this week to share in your celebration of disability as diversity. I travel all over the country and I have quickly grown to love Asheville and this university for setting such a shining example to the rest of the country when it comes to opportunities for Autistic people and their families. Let me start by telling you a little bit about myself and why I am talking to you today about neurodiversity, the diversity of human minds, and the crucial role universities play in fostering and supporting diverse minds both in academia and in the world at large. I\u2019m Autistic. In a perfect world, my telling you that would not be much different from my telling you that I\u2019m white, 49 years old, a musician, or a nature-lover. It\u2019s a fact about who I am.  Being Autistic means that my nervous system, including my brain, is wired differently. Some of my senses, like hearing, are tuned so high that the world can be a painful place for me. Other senses, such as my proprioceptive sense \u2014 that is, my sense of where my body is located \u2014 are tuned so low that I have to move around a lot to feel comfortable. That\u2019s just one small sample of the ways that my body and mind respond to the environment differently. My nervous system has a wide variety of interesting twists and turns and some of those twists can vary from day to day or even moment to moment. Each Autistic person has their own interesting nervous system and that\u2019s why we can be so different from one another in so many ways yet all be Autistic. As a child, I had a lot of difficulty with school. I wasn\u2019t getting adequate support and so I tended to be disruptive in class, trying to get the sensory input I needed for those senses that were turned on low and trying to escape the sensory inputs that were too intense for me to handle. Any of you who have worked with Autistic children know what kind of challenges I was up against, not to mention the challenge I presented to my teachers. Those were less enlightened times and it can fairly be said that I got an education in spite of school rather than because of it. We still have a long way to go, but our understanding of autism has evolved and more and more Autistic children are getting good educations as they grow into Autistic teens. More and more Autistic young adults are graduating high school and seeking a university education. This is a terrific turn of events and universities are scrambling to set supports in place to help neurodivergent students succeed in college. Neurodivergent? Some of you will be very familiar with that word while others have never heard the word before and are figuring it out through context. Neurodivergent is just what it sounds like: some people, like me, have minds that diverge from the mainstream. We are neurodivergent. You might have heard the word neurotypical used to describe people who aren\u2019t autistic? Today I want to talk about the importance of supporting neurodivergent students \u2014 all those students who are not neurotypical. Although I am Autistic and autism is the neurodivergence with which I am the most familiar, both because I have lived Autistic for 49 years but also because I have hundreds of friends all over the world who are also Autistic, autism is not the only neurodivergent neurotype.  All these neuro- words! The root of these words is Neurodiversity, the main word in the title of my presentation today \u2014 Neurodiversity: Creativity and Innovation Thrive When We Welcome Diverse Minds. I want to unpack that word a little bit because understanding what neurodiversity is (and is not) will help you understand why it is, or should be, such an important part of the university mandate.  There are three different but interconnected things I can mean when I use the word neurodiversity: First, neurodiversity is simply a biological fact. We all have brains and all our brains have variations. We might use a word like \u201cneurotypical\u201d or talk about \u201cthe neuromajority\u201d or even say things about \u201cthe average brain\u201d or \u201ca normal brain\u201d but hopefully most of you realize that there is no such thing. Everyone\u2019s brain is different from everyone else\u2019s brain in ways both subtle and significant. Those of us who are identified as neurodivergent have more significant variation from the majority, but all brains differ and thus the word \u201cneurodiversity\u201d is a word that describes every one of us. This is neurodiversity as a simple, undeniable, scientific fact. All of nature supports diversity and we have noticed that our natural environment thrives best when we work to preserve biodiversity. The world of ideas is not dissimilar from nature and universities have fostered a spirit of fearless inquiry and seek to create a sanctuary for human knowledge and wisdom. More on this notion of intellectual diversity and its intersection with neurological diversity shortly. A second meaning of the word is found in the phrase \u201cthe neurodiversity paradigm.\u201d The neurodiversity paradigm is a philosophical approach to the biological fact of neurodiversity. The neurodiversity paradigm holds that neurodiversity is not only a natural trait of human existence but that this diversity of minds is a valuable attribute of our species. The neurodiversity paradigm maintains that it is wrong to value one type of brain above another because each has its particular benefits and contributions. Just as we would rightfully cringe at the thought of determining which gender, religion (or lack thereof), or ethnicity is the best, the neurodiversity paradigm instructs us to stop playing favorites with brain types and seek instead to foster all that is great about every brain and every human being in whom those brains dwell and for whom those brains and their larger nervous systems serve as the seat of thought, feeling, will, perception, and identity. A third meaning of the word neurodiversity is political: \u201cthe neurodiversity movement.\u201d The neurodiversity movement, which was born in the Autistic community but exists to serve and support all neurologies \u2014 particularly those of fellow neurodivergents such as people with ADHD (many of whom have chosen to identify as Kinetics to escape a pathologizing label), dyslexia, anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia, and more \u2014 is a political movement seeking justice and equality for all those \u201cdifferently-brained\u201d people in every sphere of society, including the university.  So neurodiversity is a biological reality, a philosophy about that reality, and a political movement informed by that philosophy.  Now back to the mandate of the university and why I posit that upholding the neurodiversity paradigm \u2013 the philosophy that all brain types are valuable \u2013 is, or should be, part of that mandate.  Over 160 years ago, John Henry Newman wrote a book many still value today for the way he explained and defined the concept of a liberal education, \u201cThe Idea of a University.\u201d In that book, Newman explains why it is important for a university to offer areas of study that still garner criticism today, such as the humanities. \u00a0  \u201cit is a great point,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto enlarge the range of studies which a University professes, even for the sake of the students; and, though they cannot pursue every subject which is open to them, they will be the gainers by living among those and under those who represent the whole circle. This I conceive to be the advantage of a seat of universal learning, considered as a place of education. An assemblage of learned men, zealous for their own sciences, and rivals of each other, are brought, by familiar intercourse and for the sake of intellectual peace, to adjust together the claims and relations of their respective subjects of investigation. They learn to respect, to consult, to aid each other. Thus is created a pure and clear atmosphere of thought, which the student also breathes, though in his own case he only pursues a few sciences out of the multitude.\u201d What Newman is describing could be called academic diversity or intellectual diversity and you will be hard-pressed to find academic faculty who believe a university should narrow its range and exclude wide swaths of intellectual disciplines from the educational menu offered to students and, by extension, to the world at large. At one time or another nearly every discipline universities embrace has been threatened with extinction by legislative budget cuts coming from outsiders unable to recognize the immense value that comes from art history, philosophy, musical performance, political science, theoretical mathematics, foreign languages, even English. Economic pressures and political forces focused more on everyday pragmatism than on the sort of creativity and innovation that fires the human spirit to ever higher achievements seek always to convert universities from temples of knowledge to cookie-cutter vocational pathways.  Universities resist this attempted narrowing of the collective mind every day. Yet what of the narrow range of the types of minds welcome to engage in this Great Conversation of universal learning? Not only is there a place in academia for a wide range of minds, including those which diverge from the dominant majority of neurotypes, but the university needs neurological diversity in order to thrive and grow. All great thought and innovation has benefitted from diversity of one form or another. African-American minds brought us the blood bank (Charles Drew), open-heart surgery (Dr. Daniel Hale Williams), an understanding of bioluminescence (Emmett Chapelle), the traffic signal (Garrett Morgan), the gas mask (Garrett Morgan), the synthesis of medicinal drugs from plants (Percy Lavon Julian), not to mention the literature of Maya Angelou, James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, W.E.B. DuBois, Ralph Ellison, Langston Hughes, Malcolm X, and so many more.  We celebrate the accomplishments of so many brilliant minds of people from various sexual and gender minorities such as Alan Turing, John Maynard Keynes, Margaret Mead, Florence Nightingale, Oscar Wilde, Willa Cather, Emily Dickinson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Leonard da Vinci. Accomplished and brilliant women are far too numerous to name, but a few of my favorites include Emmy Noether, who developed much of the mathematical modelling of Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, Rosalind Franklin, whose x-ray photograph of DNA revealed its helical structure to Crick and Watson, Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who discovered pulsars, Chien-Shiung Wu, who disproved a law in physics, the law of parity, that had been believed for thirty years prior to her work, Nettie Stevens, who discovered X and Y chromosomes. I\u2019m sure most of you are familiar with the Autistic agricultural scientist, Temple Grandin, and realize that it was her innovative work that is revolutionizing the cattle slaughter industry, making it simultaneously more efficient and more humane.  There are so many more great neurodivergent thinkers: John Nash won a Nobel prize for his work with game theory. Vernon L. Smith won a nobel prize for his work in experimental economics. Michelle Dawson has conducted great work studying cognition and perception in autism. Charles Dickens wrote classics of literature still lauded over 100 years later. Franz Liszt, Vincent Van Gogh, Scott Joplin, J.D. Salinger, Kurt Godel, Max Weber, Sylvia Plath, William Styron, Georg Cantor, Robert Pirsig, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Joseph Pulitzer, Charlotte Perkins Gilman \u2026 surely I have convinced you of the value of fostering the creativity and innovation that comes from neurodivergence by now? But it\u2019s easy to value neurodivergence after the great achievements. As novelist and poet Marge Piercy wrote:   \u00a0   \u201cGenius is what they know you / had after the third volume / of remarkable poems. Earlier / they accuse you of withdrawing, / ask why you don\u2019t have a baby, / call you a bum.\u201d It is crucial for the university to embrace the neurodiversity paradigm because not all genius can prevail against social stigma and unaccommodated barriers of disability. Jack Kerouac, with schizophrenia, produced brilliant work but drank himself to death. Sylvia Plath, with recurrent depression, produced brilliant work but ended her life by putting her head in the oven. Virginia Woolf, bipolar, produced brilliant work but ended her life by loading her pockets with stones and walking into the ocean.  Two months ago, Rex Morgan, an 8-year-old Autistic boy was stopped by his mother during a suicide attempt. He explained to her that life made him too anxious and \u201cbeing asleep is better than being awake.\u201d His mother saved his life but he is part of an estimated 30 to 50 percent of Autistic people who have considered, attempted, or completed suicide. Life is often difficult to bear for those who are wired differently from the majority when support and accommodations have to be fought for as if they were special privileges. The barriers faced by neurodivergent people are massive but not insurmountable. And the creativity and fresh thought neurodivergence can bring to universities must be fostered and supported through accommodations and opportunities designed to help break down those barriers and nurture the spirit of those whose greatest pains and greatest joys can come from the same source: their divergence from the mainstream. You may ask yourself, \u201cuniversity funding is already threatened on all levels and from all directions. Where will we find funding for special treatment for these different minds?\u201d And if you do, I will tell you that you are asking the wrong question. Accommodations are not special treatment; they are investments in society. It was North Carolina\u2019s own Ronald L. Mace who pioneered the concept of Universal Design: the concept of creating architectural structures with all people of all ages and abilities in mind. Mace believed that good design accommodates everyone and helps to eliminate stigma and ableism by viewing access as a basic human right and disability as an aspect of human diversity. Mace devoted his life and his work as an architect to educating us all that accessibility accommodations benefit everyone of every level of ability. He worked to build a world everyone could participate in and found great success in that work, including the accessibility of the Capitol Building and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. It is time for Mace\u2019s vision to be extended to neurological disability. Remember: the accommodations and supports that will help increase the neurodiversity of academia are not expensive \u201cspecial needs\u201d efforts that only benefit a few. Universities can and must develop accommodations that help all students to succeed in their studies and in their lives. What student would not benefit from a strong counseling program? Who has not yearned for a designated quiet space to decompress after a stressful day? I\u2019ve seen universities bring therapy animals to designated areas during midterms and finals week for all students to pet and hug. The arboretums, gardens, and landscaping of many universities are encouraged as much for their effects on the human spirit as for their educational value.  I am not suggesting that we sacrifice rigor or intellectual discipline in our universities, but rather that we surround our academic exploration and inquiry with an inclusive environment and a culture of acceptance and mutual assistance in which bullying and ostracization have no place.  I am calling for a university culture in which those who move and communicate and think differently are valued and welcomed as vital participants in the life of the mind and service to the world that the university has long fostered and promoted.  I charge all of you to do your part in creating an academic environment where there is no single right way to come to answers and solutions and where different ways of gathering information, processing ideas, communicating thoughts, and synthesizing knowledge are not just valued but actively supported and not just for neurodivergent students, but for all students. There is no room in the university for prejudices against academics whose minds differ in ways large or small. We are all on the same journey of discovery and stretching the limits of human understanding. Let\u2019s make a point of finding every way to be kind to one another on that journey and help one another over and around the access barriers we stumble across on our way from here to the infinite realms of human potential. Yes, neurodivergent students will often still need additional accommodations such as: quiet areas for testing, alternate methods for communicating answers in class or on tests, extra time for processing and recording answers for tests, visors to shield their eyes from harsh overhead lights, help with time scheduling, support for self-care needs, supported living arrangements on campus, a guarantee of all important communication being provided in written form, and many other accommodations too numerous or too individualized to list here.  Accommodations are a small investment for the return society sees from encouraging thought, communication, and problem-solving from those who bring such fresh vision to the table. And the alternative to accommodating those who are eager and capable of university-level work with reasonable support is to leave valuable human beings \u2014 and have no doubt: all human beings are valuable \u2014 excluded, isolated, and discarded. How many lives have been wasted or even lost because of the limiting fears, stigmas, and false beliefs of others about what a mind like theirs is truly capable of?  What\u2019s more, excluding neurodivergent students from academia, whether intentionally or inadvertently, deprives other students who could have benefitted from sharing intellectual insights with others who think and view the world differently from them? We encourage foreign exchange programs because exposure to minds of students from other countries broadens us all. Let us encourage greater neurodiversity in universities so that, to re-visit Newman\u2019s words, students can  learn \u2018to respect, to consult, and to aid each other, creating a pure and clear atmosphere of thought.\u2019 When neurodivergent minds are effectively denied access through a lack of sufficient support and accommodation, everyone loses. When we approach university with a truly collegial spirit, we all win. If you want your university to be better than ever, look at the barriers laid before neurodivergent students and potential students and work to dismantle them, creating a truly universally accessible university where creativity and innovation can thrive, thanks to a meeting of the minds \u2026. All minds. It is time for the university to become an intellectual ecosystem that understands the deep value of fostering neurodiversity.

This blog post has been graciously  translated into Russian by Neurodiversity in Russia . image description: a silhouette of an agitated looking person, surrounded by words of negativity and self-doubt, such as \u201cdeficiency,\u201d \u201cdisrespect, \u201d \u201cdisconnection,\u201d \u201cweakness,\u201d \u201crejection,\u201d \u201cabandonment,\u201d \u201cinadequacy,\u201d and so on. Mixed in with these words is the word, \u201cdisability,\u201d which does not deserve to be connected to words like humiliation, instability, inadequacy, and insignificance but still gets slipped into the mix unquestioned because society\u2019s ableism is so deeply ingrained in our cultural views that it is virtually invisible. It\u2019s a fancy academic-sounding term: internalized ableism. It means feeling less worthy than others, ashamed of who you are, unwilling to stand up for what you deserve, or even hating yourself. And it\u2019s so culturally supported by society that many people (including myself) can play host to ableist self-deprecation or self-loathing for years without even realizing it. I have been working on my own internalized ableism for years and still keep finding pockets of invisible ableism in myself. Let me put that in more blunt terms: after years of working on loving and accepting myself, I still find entire areas of my life in which I have held myself back unnecessarily due to feeling unworthy on a fundamental level. I\u2019d like to share with you some of what I wrote on my private Facebook wall this week, to help you understand how damaging internalized ableism has been in my own life: -=-=-=- When my daughter died, there was a small voice inside me that said, \u201cit might be for the best. You are poor. You are disabled. What kind of life could you have given her? There is a reason so many people in your life put pressure on you to abort her. Maybe keeping her was selfish. Maybe it\u2019s better that she didn\u2019t live. What right did you have to try to bring life into this world anyway?\u201d This is the first time I have fully admitted those thoughts in public. I tried once. I went to a meeting of Compassionate Friends, a support group for people whose children have died. I got the first sentence out, \u201cI was thinking maybe it was for the best that she died\u2026\u201d When I was interrupted by the meeting leader. He was angry. He shouted at me. He asked me if it was for the best that another member\u2019s child had died in a fire, that one was murdered, that one had died from cancer, that one had been hit by a car. He shouted and shouted and there was no room for me to shout back, \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about your children! I was talking about me and what a horrible mother I would have been. Maybe it was for the best because no one should have to have a mother like me!\u201d But I didn\u2019t shout back. I cried. And I ran from the room. And I fell down in the parking lot because I was crying too hard to see. I banged myself up pretty bad, but it didn\u2019t hurt. I was already hurting too much to feel it. And here I sit, almost 22 years later. In the intervening years, I told myself that I didn\u2019t really want her. I told myself that I didn\u2019t want a child, that I loved my freedom too much to give it up. I reminded myself of all the sacrifices parents make for their children and how expensive children are. How expensive and noisy and messy and heart-breaking. I congratulated myself for dodging a bullet and reminded myself how grateful I am to be unencumbered and not responsible for another human being\u2019s well-being. And life. And suffering. Because if I had a child, they would just grow up to hate me for all my shortcomings anyway. They would hate me for bringing them up in poverty. And they would be ashamed of my disability. And I would be burdensome to them. And, knowing my genetics, they would hate me for the disabilities they were born with because I was too selfish to just not reproduce. And the truth is that I mourn her every day. And the truth is that I mourn not becoming a parent. And the truth is that I watch my ovarian clock tick, tick, tick, seeing time running out and knowing there is never a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cright\u201d time to have a child, but that all the best times are behind me and I would be a fool to have a child now, at almost fifty years old, in poverty, living in a vehicle, only just barely starting to build a career, finally, after a lifetime of false starts and shredded dreams. And I wish I had the courage and opportunity to be that fool. And I know I won\u2019t. Because I\u2019m too scared, too poor, too disabled. And I would be a horrible mother. And my child would grow to hate me. But I beg of anyone reading this, I beg of the world: there are younger people out there who would like to have a family but are being held back because they are disabled and people in their lives have taught them that they shouldn\u2019t have children, that it would be wrong, that they can\u2019t do it. Do not leave those young people to end up in twenty or thirty years where I am, wishing they could turn back the clock and have another chance. No parents raise their children alone. All parents have a support system comprised of some combination of friends, family, government, society. Disabled parents need support as they raise their children. All parents need support as they raise their children. I wish I had not been so ashamed of my poverty and disability that I let life slip by without holding my own, living, growing child in my arms and doing what all parents do: loving them and raising them as well as I possibly could. Life\u2019s own longing for itself. I missed my chance to fulfill it. Don\u2019t let that happen to today\u2019s young, hopeful, disabled, would-be parents. -=-=-=- Feeling unworthy to have a family and raise a child is only one example of internalized ableism. People with internalized ableism can subconsciously (or consciously) sabotage their chances for a better education or a better job because they feel unworthy. They describe themselves using medical language of pathology because they were brought up to refer to their minds and bodies with words of lack and brokenness only. Some forms of internalized ableism superficially resemble high self-esteem until you scratch the surface. I meet people who refer to themselves as \u201chigh functioning,\u201d which might seem like a self-esteem phrase until you look a layer deeper and see the fear of being mistaken for \u201cone of those.\u201d When ableism is levelled against other people with your same disability but different support needs, it is a sign of internalized ableism as well. Those who truly accept themselves as they are have no need to punch down \u2013 whether directly or indirectly \u2013 against those with the same disability. Accepting yourself means accepting others who are like you, not fighting to distance yourself from those who resemble you in some way. I see people recoiling from the word \u201cdisabled,\u201d as if it were a great insult. You are fighting the wrong demons. Instead of fighting against the valuable and useful word \u201cdisabled,\u201d please fight against the underlying ableism that causes you to recoil in horror from the word, \u201cdisabled.\u201d Instead, do something pro-active to make the lives of disabled people better, happier, and more just. When you try to hide from the word \u201cdisabled,\u201d you are only increasing the sum total of ableism in the world and that is what will truly hold you or your child back in life. Sadly, internalized ableism has held me back from so many things I wanted from life. It is a great injustice to allow rampant, half-hidden ableism to squash even one more dream. Root out ableism, both in society and within yourself, and let\u2019s stamp it out forever.

Photograph copyright 2016 by Sparrow Rose Jones This is a re-blog of a blog post originally made on 7 November, 2014. Content note: discussion of bad therapy, including video footage of a suffering child. About a month ago,  I wrote about the types of therapies used with Autistic children . I mentioned the sorts of practices that are not advisable and what to look for to see if the therapy your kid is getting is helpful or harmful. I was thrilled to hear from lots of parents whose children are getting great therapy that builds them up in many ways. I am so happy that there are professionals out there who understand autism and work to help kids grow up to be their happiest, most productive Autistic selves instead of training them to pretend to be someone they aren\u2019t. Many other people asked for something more specific than the words I wrote. Some people gave me links to videos and asked me to comment on them. Others asked me if I had videos that showed good or bad therapy practices. That\u2019s what this post is all about. This is important stuff and many people specifically asked me to do this. It is not my intention to publically shame anyone by using publically available videos. I am sharing one video that I found particularly disturbing and two video examples of good therapies in the hopes that seeing these examples will help make the ideas I write about more visual and understandable. I\u2019d like to start with a four minute video titled \u201c Isabella 22- Knock-down drag out battle for Severely Autistic Child to attempt Speech \u201c. I want to warn the sensitive that this is a difficult video to watch. Many of my Autistic friends were unable to watch the video or could only watch a few seconds before they had to turn it off because of the level of suffering and because of the difficult memories it triggered in them. I watched this video several times so I could analyze and write about it and it was very hard for me, too. There are reasons why I am only sharing one example of harmful therapy and one of those reasons is that I just can\u2019t handle watching very much of it myself. And, again, I want to emphasize that I am not accusing Isabella\u2019s parents of anything. I am 100% sure that they are loving parents who care deeply about their child and her future and who believe that they are helping her to have a better life with the therapy they are providing for her. But I cringe in pain when I see what the poor girl is being put through in the name of helping her. I assume her parents put this video online to help others know more about therapy. Please take my comments in that light as well. Let me start by talking about my broad impressions of this therapy session. Just the title of this video is a first clue about the attitude the adults in her life have toward Isabella\u2019s therapy. They call it a \u201cknock-down drag out battle.\u201d Now, I\u2019ll be the first to admit that parenting, or being parented, can often be a battle of the wills. I was a pretty difficult kid and I\u2019ll admit that. But this video is nearly four minutes of Isabella crying with frustration and confusion while her therapist repeats \u201cma ma ma!\u201d at her, over and over, trying to get Isabella to say \u201cmama\u201d and get gummy bears as a reward. The therapist showed her candy, then withheld it from her while making lots of confusing sounds at her and leaving Isabella to try to figure out what the heck was going on, what was expected of her, and why she could see but not get the candy. If I dangled candy in front of a child but refused to give it to her and made her cry with frustration, you would call me a bully and say I was taunting the child and that I should stop making the little girl cry and just give her the candy, right? But because Isabella is Autistic, some professionals believe it\u2019s not cruel; it\u2019s therapy. There are so many important things to say about this short video of a therapy session. Something really important, though, is that this is not in line with the ways language acquisition occurs. What is happening in this therapy session is closer to the way animals are trained to perform tricks. When I was a pre-teen, I taught my standard poodle to shake paws. He never understood what a handshake meant to me \u2014 all he ever knew was that it made me very happy if I put out my hand and he put his paw in it. And he liked to make me happy, so he learned to shake paws very quickly and would do it every time I offered my hand. And I never used food to teach him, just affection. And I never made him whine with confusion or behave in a distressed manner. Now, I don\u2019t mean to compare an Autistic child to a dog. That would be demeaning. But look at this speech therapy and tell me that Isabella is not being trained like a dog to mimic a behavior she doesn\u2019t understand any more than my dog understood a handshake. In fact, Isabella is being treated far worse than most dogs are treated, because she is in real distress as she tries to get the candy and has no idea what is going on or why she keeps getting teased with candy. This is exactly the sort of trial-and-error behavior shaping you see when people train monkeys or bears to perform in circuses. It assumes that the subject being trained is incapable of understanding anything and must be bullied, badgered, and tempted until it randomly performs the act (or makes the sound) and then operant conditioning is applied to strengthen the desired response. This is not speech therapy, it is monkey training and, my apologies to Isabella\u2019s parents, but it is painful to watch. This is not a therapy that respects Isabella\u2019s personhood or addresses her needs. Not only is this treatment cruel, it is setting the stage for potential future violence. This kind of therapy creates massive amounts of frustration in people who have limited ability to express their needs and wants and who are often not allowed agency or autonomy. Right now, Isabella is wringing her hands and pulling at her clothing. How much of this can she take before she starts pushing the therapist away? When pushing doesn\u2019t make the frustration stop, how long will it take before she resorts to hitting or biting? I was a hitter and a biter, and just watching Isabella\u2019s frustration makes me want to forget everything I\u2019ve learned that keeps me from hitting people now. This is really important. People worry a lot about their \u201cviolent\u201d Autistic children as they get bigger and stronger and harder to control. But far too often, the \u201cviolence\u201d is stirred up by years of very frustrating therapy just like the session you are seeing in this video of Isabella. There\u2019s only so long that a person can take being pushed into sobbing meltdowns of frustration before they are willing to do whatever it takes to get the torment to stop. It is not only heart-breakingly cruel to treat a child this way, it is grossly irresponsible. Therapy like this creates problems. The best it will produce is a child trained to do things that make no sense in order to avoid distress and get rewards. The worst it will produce is a child that bites, kicks, hits . . . and gets bigger and stronger along with becoming less and less controllable. This therapy is not designed to raise a child who feels safe and comfortable with who they are, who feels safe to express their individuality, who is mentored in growing and developing into the best person they can be, expressing their true nature in ways others can come to connect with. The goal of being \u201cindistinguishable with their peers\u201d is a goal meant to make other people feel comfortable and happy. The goal of any therapy for an Autistic child should be to help the child feel more comfortable and happy. Therapy is not supposed to be about performing for others \u2014 it is supposed to help a person grow and express themselves in the truest, healthiest way possible. At 58 seconds, Isabella gives up and starts to wander away. The therapist gets her attention and shows her the candy again. Isabella goes back to crying because it is so frustrating for her. From her perspective, she is being teased and taunted with candy she can\u2019t have. She doesn\u2019t understand what the therapist wants from her and she is filled with anger and frustration and probably a massive sense of unfairness about the whole ordeal. At 2:20, the therapist says \u201cany sort of verbalization.\u201d Isabella is making plenty of verbalization and some of it is even pretty close to an M sound, but the therapy continues and those verbalizations aren\u2019t rewarded. How confusing for the little girl! And listen to what one adult says at 3:25 \u2013 \u201cwe can\u2019t let you win.\u201d What? Isabella is frustrated, angry, upset, crying, has no idea what they want, has made lots of \u201cmmmmm\u201d noise, has put up with having her lips pinched, having people make tickly uncomfortable sounds against her forehead, and the adults are framing the whole thing as some kind of battle of the will that they can\u2019t let her win? This is not a game to the little girl. She is not resisting making the sound because she is obstinate. That comment, about not letting her win, is possibly the most upsetting thing about this video for me. It\u2019s not a game. It\u2019s cruel. It\u2019s confusing. And I am sure that Isabella is not thinking of this session in terms of getting the upper hand or refusing to give the adults what they want. So how else can speech therapy look? Well, here\u2019s an example:  RPM \u2013 how it\u2019s helping non-verbal autistic children . These are not isolated cases \u2014 I know children and their parents who are using RPM to learn expressive language. Over and over, I hear the same story: the people around a child think they are \u201cnot in there,\u201d are deficient, incapable, not understanding, unable to communicate, or other similar or related thoughts. Then RPM is brought in and suddenly everyone is shocked to learn that the child they thought was \u201csleepwalking\u201d through life was actually soaking up knowledge like a sponge. I have also known parents of children who did not get any kind of language therapy but their child spontaneously began spelling words on an iPad or with magnetic letters. I have a few big problems with much of the standard speech therapy: 1. the emphasis on speech-only. I won\u2019t deny that speech is very important in this world, but some people never speak. Will we never give them a way to communicate? To me, that feels like punishing someone for being unable to speak. Deaf children who are taught sign first have better overall language skills, whether they learn to speak later or not. Their written English is better if they are allowed to start with sign instead of being pushed to only speak and write English. Autistic children are the same way. If you want good future language skills, don\u2019t insist on only one method of communication now. Allow signs and gestures. Work with pictures. Try RPM or another similar method of spelling. Try everything and don\u2019t make your child get stressed about language. The more you can open up your child\u2019s options for communication now, the better their overall language acquisition will be for the course of their entire life. 2. The emphasis on getting children to say things that please others rather than things that please parents. Isabella was supposed to say \u201cmama.\u201d Over and over, I hear parents say they suffer because their child doesn\u2019t say \u201cI love you.\u201d I find it unsettling that there is so much focus on getting children to say things other people want to hear. I rejoice when I see children learning to say \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d \u201cI hurt\u201d I want\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d Teach a child the things the child will want and need to say. \u201cI love you\u201d can come later. Be honest: those three words, \u201cI love you,\u201d are for you, not for your child. Therapy should not be selfish \u2014 it should be about giving the child the tools that are important to the child. 3. The teaching methods that involve lots of emotional stress and confusion. Don\u2019t underestimate Autistic people. We often look like we aren\u2019t paying attention and aren\u2019t understanding. Give us a chance. Don\u2019t just assume that you have no choice but to train us with candy and tears. Look for therapies and teaching methods that enlist us as partners in our education. I have another video to show you. I asked my friends to share therapy videos they especially like and this  five minute Sensory Diet therapy video \u00a0(sadly, this video is no longer available on YouTube) came from Cynthia Kim at  Musings of an Aspie . First, look at how much fun the kids are having! This is something I heard a lot from parents after my ABA post last month \u2014 that their children love the therapy they get and they laugh and rejoice and only cry when it\u2019s time to leave because they want to keep going. That warms my heart beyond the telling! Yes! If your child loves therapy, you chose well. This physical play therapy the kids are doing is really important stuff. The narrator mentions that the play is engaging their vestibular and proprioceptive senses and helping them to feel like they are a part of their body, connected. It is impossible to overstress the importance of this sort of sensory play. I am here to tell you that feeling disconnected with one\u2019s body has repercussions you can\u2019t even imagine. I work to get \u201cin\u201d my body more and my body-mind disconnect affects nearly every aspect of my life. It is imperative to know, hear, and trust your body. Help your child to feel more connected to their physical existence and you will have a calmer, more centered, more confident child. The kids are learning other stuff in this therapy, too. They are learning interaction with others, they are learning to ask for what they want and need, they are learning to take turns and consider others. There is a lot of social learning that is happening while they are focusing on body learning. This is great therapy! I admit, I\u2019m a bit envious \u2014 I wish I could go play, too. I hope that sharing these videos and talking about them has helped to make the idea of helpful vs harmful therapy more concrete and clear for you. I sometimes hear parents say that these ideas are great for kids wil \u201cmild autism\u201d but their child is \u201ctoo severe\u201d and needs more. You might already know that I feel that separating the Autistic world into \u201cmild\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d (or any other similar division you might choose) is harmful to all Autistic people. But beyond that, thinking this way about your child is harmful to your child. No child is \u201cso severe\u201d that they need to be made to suffer. If therapy time is stressful for your child (and especially if therapy time is stressful for the whole family) you really want to think about the therapy you\u2019re using and what the goals are and whether those goals are worthy of your beautiful child or not. I want to leave you with a link to a blog entry \u2014  Caregiver Burnout from Love Explosions . The entry was written to address parents who feel burned out with everything that goes into caring for autistic children, but it is far more valuable than just that stated goal. read this blog entry because it paints a picture of what a healthy family looks like. The author has two beautiful daughters, one of whom is Autistic. If you are one of those parents who thinks the ideas I\u2019ve been talking about here don\u2019t apply to your family because your child is \u201ctoo severe,\u201d you should know that the Autistic daughter in the Love Explosions family is non-speaking and has epilepsy and is, by any way you would choose to measure \u201cvery severe.\u201d (Although that is not the way I think of Evie! To me, she and her sister are beautiful, bright, wonderful girls who I think of first as little sisters and second as dear friends.) This blog entry will show you what a happy, healthy household with an Autistic child can look like and what \u201ctherapy\u201d and education for an Autistic child who is developing wonderfully into a healthy, happy Autistic adult can be. There is a lot to learn in Beth\u2019s entire blog, and there is much wisdom to be gained in this one entry about living happily together as a family. I urge you to read Beth\u2019s words and take them to heart. added note: On the old blog, a commenter thanked me for mentioning RPM and gave a link to a blog written by a young man who uses RPM to communicate. I didn\u2019t want that blog link to get lost when I moved this post to the new blog, so I\u2019m including it here.

Photograph copyright 2016 by Sparrow Rose Jones This is a re-blog of a blog post originally made on 7 October, 2014. An edited version of this essay appears in the excellent anthology:  The Real Experts: Readings for Parents of Autistic Children , edited by the incomparable Michelle Sutton and available for purchase from Autonomous Press or a library or bookseller near you (and if it is not available at a library or bookseller near you, please do ask them to provide copies. Thank you.) This essay also appeared as a guest post on the  Diary of a Mom  blog and on the  Tiny Grace Notes  blog. Content note: compliance-based training, labeled as therapy. Lasting trauma and PTSD from ill-advised treatments. Sexual abuse and rape. The lasting effects of ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis). The risk of being told \u201cnot my ABA.\u201d This week, I watched a community implode. I\u2019m not going to talk about that, though, because it was very painful to watch people I love being treated so badly. But a lot of the implosion centered around a topic I do want to talk about. That topic is ABA \u2013 Applied Behavior Analysis, a common type of therapy for Autistic children. I watched people fight around in circles, chasing their metaphorical tails. It will take some time and lots of words to unpack this topic, but I hope you will stick with me on this because it\u2019s so important and there is a lot that needs to be understood here. Here\u2019s the argument in a nutshell. It gets longer, angrier, and much more detailed than this, but I am exhausted just from reading the fighting, so I\u2019m boiling it all down to two statements. And both statements are correct. Autistic adult: \u201cABA is abuse.\u201d Parent of Autistic child: \u201cI\u2019m not abusive and my child is benefitting greatly from ABA therapy.\u201d You read me right: both statements are correct. That is part of what I need to unpack today. I think the best place to start is with the fact that both people above are using the term \u201cABA\u201d, but what they are actually talking about are usually two different things. First we need to define ABA. Well, actually, first I want to put people at ease. Parents\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s got to be painful to feel like a whole group of people are ganging up on you and telling you that you are abusing your child. You love your child. You want the best for your child. You are spending thousands of dollars out of pocket to try to give your child the best possible chance in life. You worry about your child. You feel like you never even knew what love was until your child came along. You are not abusing your child. And if something you are doing is harming your child, you want to know about it and stop it. It hurts to be told that you are abusive toward the child you love so much. And my fellow Autistics\u00a0\u2014 you grew up feeling picked apart. You were subjected to things that harmed you. You still have PTSD today from things that\u00a0may have been\u00a0done with your best interests at heart but were actually quite damaging. You don\u2019t fit in to the world around you and the adults who were charged with your care when you were growing up were stumbling around in the dark when it came to trying to figure out how to raise a child like you were. It is triggering to see that\u00a0so many of the things that hurt you when you were growing up are still being said and done to and about children who are so very much like you were when you were their age. You want to stop the cycle of pain and you want children to grow up happy, healthy, and loved. It frightens and angers you to see many of the \u201cbest practices\u201d that\u00a0Autistic children today live with. And there is a good chance that the two of you \u2014 the Autistic adult and the parent of an Autistic child \u2014 are not even\u00a0talking about the same thing when you say \u201cABA.\u201d Major organizations (particularly Autism Speaks) have lobbied hard for Medicaid and insurance companies to cover ABA therapy for Autistic children. As a result, many therapists now call what they do \u201cABA,\u201d even in cases where the actual therapy is very different from\u00a0genuine ABA, in order to have their services covered by insurance. It\u2019s similar to the philosophy of therapists I\u2019ve known who don\u2019t believe in diagnosing mental illness\u00a0but put a name on their patients\u2019 struggles anyway\u00a0because many insurance policies only pay for therapy if the treatment is for a diagnosis listed in the DSM. That\u2019s the main point that I wanted to make, but there\u2019s still a lot to say on this topic. If almost everything is being called \u201cABA\u201d then what is actual ABA? And why do Autistic adults say it is abusive? What sort of warning signs should parents be watching for? What is harmful about certain practices? Those are a lot of questions to answer, but I will do my best. Bear in mind that I\u2019m not a therapist \u2014 ABA or otherwise \u2014 and I\u2019m not a parent. I\u2019m one Autistic adult, one person coping with therapy-induced PTSD, one person exhausted by the all-out war I see every day between people like me and people who love people like me, one person who wants to see a better world for everyone (but, I admit, especially for Autistic people.) ABA was developed by Dr. Ivar Lovaas. As\u00a0 a 1965\u00a0Life Magazine article  explains, the core theory of ABA was that a therapist, \u201cforcing a change in a child\u2019s outward behavior\u201d would, \u201ceffect an inward psychological change.\u201d The article says, \u201cLovaas feels that by I) holding any mentally crippled child accountable for his behavior and 2) forcing him to act normal, he can push the child toward normality.\u201d Much has changed, but this core premise of Lovaas\u2019 work remains solid. ABA\u2019s core\u00a0belief is that forty hours per week of therapy geared toward making a child externally appear as \u201cnormal\u201d as possible will \u201cfix the brokenness\u201d inside that made the child behave that way. ABA believes in an extreme form of \u201cfake it until you make it,\u201d and because it is behaviorism at its most pure \u2014 that is, a psychological science that treats internal processes as irrelevant to function (Lovaas said, \u201cyou have to put out the fire first before you worry how it started\u201d) \u2014 it treats behavior as meaningless and unwanted actions rather than as communication. This approach is troubling for many reasons. ABA strongly emphasizes the importance of intensive, saturated therapy and insists that it is crucial to get 40 hours a week of therapy for very young children. Think for a moment how exhausted you, a grown adult,\u00a0are after 40 hours of work in a week and you will begin to understand why we get so concerned about putting a three-year-old child through such a grueling schedule. Being Autistic doesn\u2019t give a three-year-old child superpowers of endurance. Forty hours a week of ABA is not just expensive, it is painfully exhausting. ABA maintains a schedule like this with the intention of breaking down a child\u2019s resistance and will. I understand that you are afraid for your child. Their future is unknown. You are worried about their ability to live a fulfilled life. You are worried about their ability to have self-supporting work and be taken care of after you pass on. And I understand that this fear, coupled with a deep desire to give your child the best you can give them, can lead you to accept the ABA attitude of \u201cmore is better.\u201d But stop a moment and think about the capacity for sustained focus of the average three-year-old and consider what a therapy that tries to double (or more) that capacity\u00a0is doing to a child. If you stress a child out or even traumatize them with\u00a0extreme therapies, you are paradoxically increasing the chances of incapacitating PTSD in the child\u2019s future. Yes, you want your child to develop as much as they are able to develop and you want them to enjoy their life and hopefully provide for themselves, but exhaustion and trauma\u00a0are not going to aid those sorts of development. Worse than the exhaustion of so many hours of therapy, though, is the heavy focus on making a child \u201cindistinguishable from his peers.\u201d The main goal of ABA is to make a child  LOOK  normal. This is insidious for a few reasons. first, it is the best way to get the parents to continue to co-operate with the therapists for many years. Of course you are going to be moved to tears if the therapist gets your child to look you in the eye or say \u201cMommy\u201d to you or sit at the table and eat a meal without fidgeting or melting down. Of course you will feel like the therapist is making progress and healing your child. That is a very natural response. So you will see the progress and you will want to continue with ABA therapy and you will be very defensive when adults Autistics online suggest that what is happening in your home might be a bad thing. What was bad were fights every mealtime. What was bad was never hearing your child\u2019s voice. What was bad were the judgmental or pitying stares you and your child got when you went out in public and people saw your child spinning around or flapping her hands or becoming so anxious you were forced to leave your groceries unpurchased and flee the store. But if your child is getting classic ABA therapy, what you are seeing is an illusion. And what looks like progress is happening at the expense of the child\u2019s sense of self, comfort, feelings of safety, ability to love who they are, stress levels, and more. The outward appearance is of improvement, but with classic ABA therapy, that outward improvement is married to a dramatic increase in internal anxiety and suffering. ABA therapists are trained to find out what your child loves the most and hold it ransom. Often, it\u2019s food. If your therapist suggests withholding food as a form of behavioral therapy, run screaming. That is harmful. If your child\u2019s therapist will not allow you to remain in the room during a session (they will usually tell you that your presence will be a distraction that will keep your child focused on you instead of on the therapy they need to be paying attention to) that is a big warning sign. If you are able to witness your child\u2019s therapy sessions and your child is spending a lot of time crying or going limp or flopping on the floor or showing signs you recognize as indicators of anxiety or fear, beware the therapy. If the therapist insists on pushing forward with the therapy when your child is crying or going limp instead of giving your child recovery time, run screaming. Therapy that trades your child\u2019s sense of safety in the present for a promise of future progress is exactly the sort of thing that Autistic adults mean when they talk about abusive therapy. Therapy should make your child better, not traumatize them, possibly for many years, potentially for the rest of their life. A therapist might tell you that \u201ca little crying\u201d is a normal thing, but I was once an Autistic child and I can tell you that being pushed repeatedly to the point of tears with zero sense of personal power and knowing that the only way to get the repeated torment to end was to comply with everything that was asked of me, no matter how painful, no matter how uneasy it made me feel, no matter how unreasonable the request seemed, knowing that I had no way out of a repeat of the torment again and again for what felt like it would be the rest of my life was traumatizing to such a degree that I still carry emotional scars decades later. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the perpetrator is a therapist, a teacher, a parent, or an age-peer: bullying is bullying. In my opinion, the goal of therapy should be to help the child live a better, happier, more functional life. Taking away things like hand flapping or spinning is not done to help the child. It is done because the people around the child are uncomfortable with or embarrassed by those behaviors. But those are coping behaviors for the child. It is very important to question why a child engages in the behaviors they do. It is very wrong to seek to train away those behaviors without understanding that they are the child\u2019s means of self-regulation. When considering whether you have made a wise choice in what therapy you are providing your child or not, you want to always remember a few cardinal rules: behavior is communication and/or a means of self-regulation. Communication is more important than speech. Human connection is more important than forced eye contact. Trust is easy to shatter and painfully difficult to re-build. It is more important for a child to be comfortable and functional than to \u201clook normal.\u201d Work on things like anxiety and sensory issues first. Work on getting better sleep (both you and your child). Things like eye contact can come later, much later, and only if your child is comfortable with them. There are work-arounds. Lots of people fake eye contact. Lots of people have good lives with minimal or no eye contact. But forcing a child to do something that is deeply painful and distressing for no reason other than to make them look more normal is not just unnecessary, it is cruel. I live two blocks from a behavioral clinic and I frequently walk several blocks out of my way to avoid walking past it because of the kinds of things I have seen when walking past the clinic. Let me tell you about the last thing I saw there, the thing that made me decide that I would rather walk an extra half-mile than risk seeing more ABA therapy on the sidewalk in front of the clinic. A mother and father came out of the clinic with a little girl, around\u00a07 years old by my best guess. Mother said, \u201cJanie (not the actual name), look at me.\u201d Janie didn\u2019t look at her mother. The mother said to the father, \u201cyou know what to do,\u201d and the father took hold of Janie and turned her head toward mother, saying, \u201clook at your mother, Janie.\u201d Janie resisted, turning her head away and trying to pull out of her father\u2019s hands. Mother crouched down and\u00a0Father\u00a0lifted Janie\u2019s\u00a0whole body up,\u00a0laying her across Mother\u2019s knee, face up. \u201cLook at your mother, Janie,\u201d father said. \u201cLook at me, Janie,\u201d Mother said. Janie began to whimper. Her body was as stiff as a board. Father held her body firm and Mother took hold of Janie\u2019s head, \u201clook at me, Janie,\u201d\u00a0Mother said. I was glued to the sidewalk. I didn\u2019t want to see any more but I\u00a0couldn\u2019t look away, couldn\u2019t walk away. Janie began\u00a0to moan and thrash her body. Father\u2019s hands held her body steady as she kicked and flailed. Mother\u2019s hands held Janie\u2019s head steady. Both kept urging Janie to look at her mother.\u00a0Janie\u2019s moans turned to screams but neither parent let her go. Finally, Janie\u2019s entire body went limp with defeat. She apparently made eye contact because Mother and Father began to lavish praise on her. \u201cGood girl,\u00a0Janie. Good eye contact.\u00a0Good girl. Let\u2019s get some ice cream now.\u201d Janie\u2019s limp body slid to the sidewalk where she lay, sobbing. Father picked her up and carried her to the car, the whole way praising her submission. \u201cGood eye contact, Janie.\u201d (This image \u2013 a drawing of eyes looking away with the caption \n\u201cForced eye contact hinders human contact\u201d \u2013 is a  sticker  and is also \navailable as a  light t-shirt  or  dark t-shirt  in adult and children\u2019s sizes.) What did Janie learn that day? I\u2019ll give you a hint: it was not that people are more trusting of those who make good eye contact. It was not that she will appear more normal and thus fit into society better if she makes good eye contact. It wasn\u2019t even that Mom really loves it when Janie connects with her through the eyes like that. Janie learned that adults can have whatever they want from her, even if it hurts and even if they have to hurt her to get it. Janie learned that her body does not belong to her and that she has to give others access to it at any time, for any reason, even if she wasn\u2019t doing anything that could hurt herself or others. Janie learned that there is no point in resisting and that it is her job to let others do what they want with her body, no matter how uncomfortable it makes her. You may think I\u2019m exaggerating or making this out to be more extreme than it is, but stop for a moment and imagine years of this therapy. Forty hours a week of being told to touch her nose and make eye contact and have quiet hands and sit still. A hundred and sixty hours a month of being restrained and punished when she doesn\u2019t want to touch her nose and being given candy and praise when she does touch her nose for the 90,000th time. Nearly two thousand hours a year of being explicitly taught that she does not own her body and she does not have the right to move it in ways that feel comfortable and safe to her. How many years will she be in therapy? How many years will she be taught to be a good girl? To touch her nose on command? To make eye contact on demand? Graduating to hugs, she will be taught that she is required to hug any adult who wants a hug from her. She will be punished when she does not hug and praised and fed when she does. And who will protect her from the predator who wants to hug her? Who will teach her that she is only required to yield her bodily autonomy for her parents and therapists but not for strangers? What if the predator turns out to be one of her therapists or parents? How will she resist abuse when she has had so many hours of training in submission? Therapy is an investment in the future, but ABA therapy is creating a future for Janie of being the world\u2019s doormat. Is that the future Janie\u2019s parents want for her? If your child\u2019s therapist believes it is more important for your child to comply with\u00a0every command\u00a0than to have any control at all over his or her body, run screaming. And don\u2019t forget that a layer of training does not change the underlying neurology. ABA uses the same methods and theories as dog training and if I train my dog to shake hands, it doesn\u2019t make him more human. It just makes him a dog who can shake hands. Similarly, if you train an Autistic to make eye contact and not flap their hands and say \u201cI love you, too\u201d and stay on task, it just makes them into an Autistic who can fake being not-autistic with some relative measure of success. Underneath the performance is still an Autistic brain and an Autistic nervous system and it is very important to remember that. Being trained to hide any reaction to painful noises, smells, lights, and feelings doesn\u2019t make the pain go away. Imagine years of living with pain that you have been trained to hide. How long would it last before you broke down? Some Autistics last an amazingly long time before they break down and burn out. And intensive ABA therapy will also teach a child that there is something fundamentally wrong and unacceptable about who they are. Not only is that child trained to look normal, they are trained to hate who they are inside. They are trained to hate who they are and hide who they are. They will work very hard to hide who they are, because they have learned to hate who they are. And as a result, they will push themselves to the brink of destruction. And when they finally crumble from years of hiding their sensory pain and years of performing their social scripts and blaming themselves every time a script doesn\u2019t carry them successfully through a social situation, they will be angry at themselves and blame themselves for their nervous breakdown and autistic burn-out. All those years of ABA therapy will have taught them that they are fundamentally wrong and broken; that they are required to do everything authority demands of them (whether it\u2019s right or wrong for them); that they are always the one at fault when anything social goes wrong; that they get love, praise, and their basic survival needs met so long as they can hide any trace of autism from others; that what they want doesn\u2019t matter. Now you know what to watch for. Your child\u2019s therapist may use the term \u201cABA\u201d in order to get paid, but they might not be doing these harmful, degrading, abusive things to your child at all. If your child\u2019s therapist is respecting your child, not trying to break down the child\u2019s sense of self and body-ownership, treating behavior as communication rather than pointless motions that need to be trained away, valuing speech but not at the expense of communication, giving your child breaks to recover and not over-taxing their limited focusing abilities . . . then they can call their therapy anything they want to, but it is not ABA. (And hold on to that therapist! They are golden!) And I hope that the next time you hear an Autistic adult say that ABA is abuse, you are compassionate. Remember the suffering so many of us endured. Know that we say those things because we love your children and want to help them. We do not say them because we hate you and want to call you abusers. We don\u2019t hate you at all and we want to help you. Sometimes we are clumsy in how we go about it, because, well, we are Autistic and communication difficulties are part of that package. But know that when we attack ABA, we are not intending to attack you. We want your child to sleep through the night and laugh with joy and become toilet trained (on whatever schedule their bodies can handle \u2014 don\u2019t forget that we tend to be late bloomers), and have a healthy, happy, productive, love-filled life. We want you to rejoice in parenting and connect with your children on a deep and meaningful level. When an Autistic adult says \u201cABA is abuse,\u201d you might be tempted to hear, \u201cyou are abusing your child.\u201d But that is not what we are saying. Next time you hear an Autistic adult say \u201cABA is abuse,\u201d please hear those words as, \u201cI love you and your child. Be careful! There are unscrupulous people out there who will try to convert the fear you feel for your child\u2019s future into money in their pocket at the cost of your child\u2019s well-being.\u201d And if you are a therapist and you are upset when we say \u201cABA is abuse\u201d, know that we are not talking about you . . . unless you are using shock punishments or making children endure long hours of arduous therapy beyond their ability to cope or teaching children that they do not have the right to say who can have access to intimacy with their body or not (and forced eye contact is a particularly nasty violation of a person\u2019s control over their bodily intimacy.) If you are not the kind of therapist who we are talking about when we talk about the harm of therapy, then we are not talking about you! Thank you for being one of the good guys. We\u00a0need more like you. Teach others what you know. Spread the love and help change the world, please! Thank you for reading all of this. I know it was a lot of words, but this is such an important topic. The children are the future and I don\u2019t have words to explain how painful it is when I see Autistic adults being verbally bullied and abused because they are trying to help the children by helping parents to understand more about the lived experience of autism and more about the kinds of things that can be very harmful to Autistic lives. I had over a decade of therapy in my childhood and much of it was not good therapy and I am explicitly damaged because of it. When I say ABA is abuse \u2014 when we Autistic adults say ABA is abuse \u2014 we are speaking from a collective wisdom gained through painful experiences that have left lasting scars on us. We don\u2019t want anyone else to have to go through the pain we have gone through.\u00a0Please respect where we are coming from and please do not add to the trauma by attacking us for trying to help others.

The photograph has been put through post-processing to frame the tree in light while darkening the borders of the picture. Photograph copyright 2016, Sparrow Rose Jones A reader named Karin posted a lengthy comment on my blog post from two days ago and I felt that all the time and effort that went into it deserved a full blog response. You can read Karin\u2019s full comment under the blog essay  What Is a Disorder? \n \n Those of you who have read my latest book,  The ABCs of Autism Acceptance , will recognize that I\u2019ve covered this ground already, in my chapter \u201cI is for Identity-First Language,\u201d  \u00a0 Thank you, Karin, for your thoughtful and courteous comment. I also have anxiety, C-PTSD, and depression. These acquired neurodivergences are not, in my case, traits I was born with but neurological responses to abuse and ableism, both of which I\u2019ve been handed heaping helpings of throughout my life. I am sorry to hear that you struggle with these very challenging neurodivergences\u00a0 as well. \u00a0 I would tend to agree that using or preferring person-first language doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a person views the trait being described as a bad trait, but most often it does and I see indications from your words that you do feel that person-first language is necessary to try to linguistically separate a person from an undesirable trait. Specifically, your response to the choice so many of us have made to refer to ourselves as Autistic shows that you feel autism is a highly undesirable trait that should be held as far away from a person as possible. I will explain further shortly; I am addressing your points in the same order that you made them. \u00a0 You write,  \u201cI want others to see me as a whole person. My disability is PART of me, yes, and it affects many choices I make\u2026but I also have personality traits and interests that have nothing to do with my disability.\u201d \u00a0 This is where Autism (and many other neurodivergences) are not like many other disabilities.  \u00a0 As an Autistic, I  am  a whole person. \u201cAutistic\u201d is a label of identification that contains full personhood within it, much as many other labels of identification. If I called someone a \u201cwoman\u201d or a \u201cMuslim\u201d or \u201cBlack,\u201d would you feel that it was important for them to use person-first language because someone might mistakenly forget that they are a whole person? Instead, perhaps, I should call them a \u201cperson with femaleness\u201d or \u201ca person who follows Islam\u201d or \u2026. I\u2019m having a hard time with this last one, because every person-first construction I can think of feels so wrong. \u201cA person with Blackness\u201d is about the best I can come up with. My apologies. \u00a0 These constructions feel awkward and wrong and sometimes even a bit insulting because\u2026.well, because they are. I am trying to separate out someone\u2019s gender, religion, or racial identity from their personhood. I am suggesting that these core traits of personal identity somehow obscure the fact that women, Muslims, and Blacks are whole people. Ridiculous, right? \u00a0 But people seem to feel so differently about Autistics. Is it because we\u2019re disabled? I don\u2019t think so. Do people question whether a wheelchair user is a whole person? I\u2019m sure some ignorant people do, but most people don\u2019t \u2014 as evidenced by the linguistic construction: a wheelchair user, not a person with a wheelchair (although I have seen \u201ca person who uses a wheelchair\u201d but not exclusively.) The same goes for someone who\u2019s Blind or Deaf. We don\u2019t tend to talk about a person with blindness or a person with deafness. \u00a0 It is because Autism is a developmental disability and sometimes an intellectual disability. This is where I see people insisting most fiercely that person-first language is important to remind others that they are talking about a whole person. We have a cultural prejudice against those of us with neurological disabilities. Because the brain is the seat of pretty much everything \u2014 our senses, our movement, our thoughts, our memories, our drives, our communication \u2014 people take an extremely ableist view that a brain that is not like theirs might be the seat of someone who is not fully human. \u00a0 That\u2019s so important, I want to say it again in its own paragraph: people get so insistent about using person-first language to \u201cremind\u201d the world that Autistic people are whole people because they don\u2019t fully believe it themselves. \u00a0 Why would anyone need to be reminded of our personhood? Because people don\u2019t really believe we have personhood. No one needs to insist that you remember that women are people. It\u2019s self-evident that women are people, right? (Okay, maybe not always. But among reasonable people, yes, it\u2019s self-evident.) Person-first language is a perfect example of Gertrude\u2019s exclamation in Hamlet: \u201cThe lady doth protest too much, methinks.\u201d  \u00a0 Another thing that\u2019s different about autism, compared to many other disabilities: you talk about having personality traits and interests that have nothing to do with your disability. My disability is that I have a type of brain that is in the minority and I live in a society that looks down on those of us who are in a neurominority. So everything I do and love and think and feel gets pathologized as a \u201csymptom\u201d of a \u201cdisorder\u201d \u00a0because it all comes from my beautiful but misunderstood brain.  \u00a0 You see, I actually  am \u00a0my brain and I  am \u00a0autism and all my personality traits and interests come from my Autistic brain and that\u2019s why I refer to myself as Autistic rather than trying to create some kind of artificial separation between myself and \u2026. Myself. It makes no sense to try to separate myself from autism because I am my brain and my brain is Autistic. And my brain is beautiful and wonderful and not something I want to try to disown by using person-first language to try to create some kind of pretense that my self is not my self due to shame about my self or a false belief that being my self makes me less than a whole person. \u00a0 Rather than using unnatural language to try to convince others that I am a whole person (and I don\u2019t know how I could convince someone I am a whole person by using the language of shame and lack of personhood) I prefer to do the work I\u2019m doing right this minute: the work of explaining to people that their belief that Autistics are not whole people is illogical and bigoted and needs to stop. We should not have to hold ourselves out away from ourselves as if our identity were soiled underwear in order to be recognized as the whole people we are. It is an oppression to insist that we will only be viewed as whole people by disowning our own brains. \u00a0 So it is a very different thing for someone with a \u201cphysical disability\u201d (I think that\u2019s a false dichotomy, but that\u2019s another essay for another day) to use \u00a0person-first language, because a diabetic *can* be considered separately from their diabetes or a person with Ehrler-Danlos Syndrome (a connective tissue disorder I have) is a person completely independently of what their tendons and ligaments are doing. But my disability is one of cognition, perception, communication \u2014 it\u2019s my brain that is different from the mainstream and my brain is me and using person-first language to try to distance me from my brain is actually  denying  my personhood rather than affirming it. \u00a0 Karin writes,  \u201cI do have a question about the language I see many autistic people including yourself often using \u2013 \u201cAutistics.\u201d I understand calling yourselves A/autistic people, but not autistics. To me as a reader it sounds dehumanizing and distancing. Can you explain this so I can understand? I just cannot imagine ever calling myself a disabled, a cerebral palsied or other people with my condition cerebral palsies. I understand the concept of identity first in general, but why remove the person part?\u201d \u00a0 If it sounds dehumanizing and distancing, it is because you have internalized the ableism I was just speaking of \u2014 the idea that being Autistic is being lesser in some way, particularly in the area of being human. It is intriguing to me that you call identity-first language \u201cdistancing\u201d when it is person-first language that strives to distance me from my own brain.  \u00a0 If you feel that calling myself Autistic has \u201cremoved the person part\u201d you are admitting that you feel Autistics are not whole humans and require additional linguistic humanity to be added. By referring to myself by my neurotype, I am saying, \u201cI am this type of human\u201d just like a person referring to themselves by their gender says \u201cI am this type of human.\u201d No one suggests that identifying as \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d has removed the person part because no one feels it needs to be added in the first place. Believing that Autistics need to have person added to our identity reveals an underlying belief that it isn\u2019t already there, rolled into the definition the way it is for men, women, and all gender identities . \u00a0 Karin writes (in reference to depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc.):  \u201cWe need treatments. Cures. Adequate healthcare coverage for intensive therapy when needed, better medications that don\u2019t have bad side effects or cost a fortune. I don\u2019t think it is wrong to pursue treatments or cures for conditions while also saying \u201cI am a valuable person as I am and deserve respect and opportunities, not stigma.\u201d\u201d \u00a0 I am not against taking medication for depression or anxiety or PTSD I am not against therapies. What I  am \u00a0against is people being defined as \u201cmentally ill\u201d against their will and forced to take medications. I can\u2019t take medication for depression because the medication makes me very sick. I have required hospitalization for the effects of anti-depressants. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to pursue treatments for depression so long as it is up to the person to choose whether to take mind-altering drugs or not.  \u00a0 But I am very much against seeking a cure for autism. My brain has 100 billion neurons and there is no way to re-wire them and make me not-autistic. There is no way to cure autism in a living person. Autism is a type of brain and you cannot change my brain. \u00a0 The only way to \u201ccure\u201d autism is to prevent it from happening and that\u2019s exactly what is happening with genome projects like MSSNG. The aim is to determine autistic genetics so that pre-natal testing can determine which babies are developing autistic brains so that their mothers can be counseled to abort them. This is not science fiction. This is exactly what has happened with Down Syndrome. Pre-natal testing for Down Syndrome results in pressure to abort when the test comes up positive. Attempts to \u201ccure\u201d autism are thinly-veiled attempts to create a world where people like me are no longer born in the first place.  \u00a0 Think for a moment how that makes us Autistics feel, watching everyone hustle to funnel millions and millions of dollars into building a world without people like us while the vast majority of us are so under served that we die from preventable diseases and live in abusive situations, sub-standard housing, homeless, or in prison because no one had any better idea of where to warehouse us. \u00a0 A \u201ccure\u201d for autism is not like a cure for Ehrlers-Danlos Syndrome. I would think it was grand if some gene therapy could cure my connective tissue disorder. I live with a lot of pain every day. My connective tissue is not \u201cme.\u201d I don\u2019t think with it. I don\u2019t dream with it. It is strictly for maintaining this physical body and moving it around, much like you describe when you write:  \u201cThe majority of problems cerebral palsy causes for me can be alleviated by better wheelchair accessibility, improved home care services, and the ending of assumptions and bias against people with physical conditions.\u201d  That is how I feel about my EDS. It is not at all how I feel about being Autistic. My EDS is painful and impacts my mobility, but Autistic is who I am, to the very core. \u00a0 Karin writes,  \u201cTo be clear, I\u2019m not championing research to cure autism, and especially not if it would involve abortion or any coercive treatment. I think we would lose something as a society/world without autistic people in it. But I also can understand that there are some autistic people who would want certain treatments, like perhaps something to make sensory stimuli less overwhelming.\u201d and \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t assume that just because we don\u2019t want something, that doesn\u2019t mean others won\u2019t want it either.\u201d  \u00a0 I have devices to make sensory stimuli less overwhelming. I am not against treatments. \u00a0 But I am strongly against millions and millions of dollars being poured into a \u201ccure\u201d.  \u00a0 Helping me to navigate the world with less pain and more understanding is called accommodation and I am a strong supporter of accommodation. I support everything that makes life easier for Autistics. The problem is that \u201ccure\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d are synonymous with things that make life harder for Autistics or erase us from the world completely.  \u00a0 I will never support \u201ccure\u201d because that can only be accomplished through genocide. \u00a0 I am cautious in my support of \u201ctreatment\u201d \u00a0because that word is used to describe so many tortures and torments that  cause  the depression, anxiety, and PTSD so many of us Autistic people live with.  \u00a0 It is our existence and core identity that are under attack and so long as this war against Autistics continues, I will boldly and proudly continue to identify as Autistic. I refuse to linguistically set my being off to one side so that I can present a socially-acceptable ghost of who I am to a society that will never fully \u00a0accept my personhood so long as I am working to hide my whole, natural humanity, no matter how many times I toss the word \u201cperson\u201d at them. \u00a0 I choose to live with integrity and authenticity, claiming my beautiful brain as my own. I am Autistic and I am proud of who I am. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/why-i-call-myself-autistic/", "title": "Why I Call Myself Autistic"},

Yesterday, I posted an essay about Autism Speak\u2019s new mission statement, and in that essay I wrote: \u201cWe are different and disabled but not disordered and we do not need you to accept a disorder; we need you to accept us.\u201d A reader commented: Great article overall, but I\u2019m a bit confused as to your meaning of \u2018we are not disordered.\u2019 As a person who does have multiple disorders aside from being autistic, I\u2019m worried about what this implies when it comes to people with mental illness and other neurodiversities beyond autism; that maybe it is a \u2018throwing one group under the bus to support another\u2019 thing. I can\u2019t imagine you meant that on purpose, and it certainly could be me misconstruing the meaning (it may have just meant to remember we are people before we are \u2018disordered\u2019) but I thought I\u2019d point it out in case it was confusing to anyone else as well. You are correct, dear reader, I did not intend to throw anyone under the bus. And I did not throw anyone under the bus, intentionally or accidentally. Since you are confused, I decided to make a fresh blog post so I can explain my perspective more thoroughly. Before I start in to topics like \u201cwhat is a disorder\u201d and \u201cwhy do I say that autism is not a disorder\u201d and \u201cmental illness\u201d \u2014 because that\u2019s a lot of ground to cover \u2014 let me make one quick side note first: The Language of the Neurodiversity Paradigm There is no such thing as \u201cneurodiversities\u201d \u00a0unless you are speaking in the same sense as modern physicists when they talk about \u201cuniverses.\u201d Neurodiversity is, to quote  Nick Walker\u2019s excellent and foundational essay : \u201cthe diversity of human brains and minds \u2013\u00a0the infinite variation in neurocognitive functioning within\u00a0our species.\u201d You can see why the plural form, \u201cneurodiversities\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026.unless one is speaking of neurodiversity among multiple species or among multiple peoples, such as humans on Earth and denizens of some as-yet undiscovered planet with which we might establish communication in the future. I think what you meant was \u201cneurodivergences.\u201d I apologize if I appear to be nitpicking your word choice, but the language of the neurodiversity paradigm and of the neurodiversity movement (two different things \u2013 see Nick Walker\u2019s essay. It\u2019s a must-read, really) are still new enough and the topic is important enough that we must all work hard to use this language accurately while these ideas are still taking shape in society\u2019s general consciousness. The linguistic work we do today will save us so much difficulty and miscommunication in years to come. I am multiply neurodivergent and the accurate use of this language is very important to me because it provides such clarity in communicating my lived experience. Now, on to the actual point of this essay. What is a Disorder? I can\u2019t say enough good about Nick Walker\u2019s work and if you have a couple of hours to watch his presentation from February 23, 2015 at CIIS, you should watch this video. I definitely recommend it, both for understanding why I say autism is not a disorder and for exposing yourself to Nick Walker\u2019s brilliance. For those who don\u2019t have time or data to watch the video, here is my summary of Nick\u2019s points that pertain to what I am discussing in this essay (there is  so  much more in his presentation than this. I love Nick Walker\u2019s work so much. Every time I take the time to listen to or read Nick\u2019s words, my entire world gets bigger. \u00a0Nick Walker is like human LSD: he expands my consciousness every time I take a dose of him.) The following paragraphs are in italics because they are my paraphrasing (and sometimes direct quotation) of what Nick Walker says in the above presentation. Diversity is creative potential. Exciting new things are introduced to society by people whose minds work differently from the minds of those in the culture around them. All forms of diversity are subject to society\u2019s power dynamics, which means that those whose minds are neurodivergent \u2014 whose minds work in ways that are noticeably different from the neuromajority \u2014 are pathologized and called disordered or ill. It\u2019s just another social power dynamic and an oppression of a minority\u2019s civil rights, just like what we\u2019ve seen before around gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, culture, etc. The dynamics work the same way. Books like the DSM tell us that autism and other neurodivergences are disorders, but it\u2019s important to remember that science has been used for a long time to justify the oppression of those who diverge in ways that society does not approve of. The oppression of neurominorities that comes from using science to describe us as \u201cdisordered\u201d is the same pattern we have already seen so many times in the past in other groups who have struggled to assert their civil rights against a society that chooses to pathologize their existence. Pathologization of \u201cdisorders\u201d leads to a social urge to normalize those who have been considered \u201cill\u201d or \u201cdiseased\u201d because their brains work in ways that differ from the \u201cstraight and narrow\u201d neurotype that society has chosen to label as \u201chealthy\u201d only because it is way that the majority of people\u2019s \u00a0brains work.  The phrase \u201cmental illness\u201d is false and a scam. When these neurodivergences are labeled as illnesses, people are convinced that the way their brain naturally works is a disease. I\u2019m not dogmatically anti-medication, but I\u2019m anti-bullshit and I think the term \u201cmental illness\u201d is bullshit.\u00a0 There are government labs where vials are stored. These vials have anthrax, small pox, measles, and other illnesses. You cannot have a \u201cvial of bipolar\u201d or a \u201cvial of autism.\u201d These do not exist outside the bodies and minds of the people who embody them. It\u2019s us, not illness. When I say that \u201cmental illness\u201d is bullshit, I\u2019m not saying nobody should ever take medication. If you are severely depressed and there is a drug that works for you and you want to take it? Go ahead. You should not have to call yourself \u201cill\u201d in order to get the mind-altering drugs you want. \u00a0I don\u2019t think people should be involuntarily medicated, ever. But I\u2019m all for consensual medication of anyone who wants it. There\u2019s a whole industry around selling these things as diseases and we live in a society that is increasingly hostile to carving out niches for people who function on different rhythms. When you honor your body and brain, Bipolar no longer feels like an illness. You\u2019re surfing your neurology.\u00a0How do you find the safe spaces to shape your life? If no one does it, it stays unsafe for people to do. The more people out there doing weird stuff with their brains and self, the more acceptable it becomes. We have an obligation to be really weird to make space for other people. So there\u2019s the background to my answer: what is a disorder? A disorder is an illness. I have some disorders \u2013 a connective tissue disorder that can be very painful, for example. But autism is not a disorder. Bipolar is not a disorder. Schizophrenia is not a disorder. There is no such thing as a mental illness because our mentation is our self and we are not ill. We are divergent members of a neurodiverse population that needs the full span of neurodiversity to fuel creativity, innovation, and the full expression of humanity. Am I Throwing Anyone Under a Bus When I Say That Autism Is Not a Disorder? I most definitely am not. I am not saying , \u201cautism is not a disorder, but some other mental stuff is.\u201d \u00a0I\u2019m saying exactly what I said in yesterday\u2019s essay: \u201cWe are different and disabled but not disordered and we do not need you to accept a disorder; we need you to accept us.\u201d I\u2019m not saying other people  are  disordered; I\u2019m saying Autistics are not. I\u2019m not speaking for other people at all \u2014 it\u2019s not my place to speak for other people \u2026 although I don\u2019t believe in the construct of \u201cmental illness\u201d \u00a0so if anyone is calling someone else disordered, it\u2019s not me. I didn\u2019t think I needed to make that explicit, but here it is explicitly stated now. Am I Saying We Are People Before We Are Disordered? No, I don\u2019t engage in person-first language. If someone else wants to use person-first language to describe themselves, I will respect their choice, but I believe in identity-first language  because  I don\u2019t believe we are disordered at all. \u00a0There is no need for person-first language, in my opinion, because person-first language is designed to separate people from things that are deemed shameful or diminishing in some way. Autism is not a disorder, it is not shameful, it is not diminishing. I see no reason to use person-first language. In fact, person-first language inherently implies that there is a disease or disorder present in a person, so I find person-first language offensive when directed at me. As I said, I will respect someone else\u2019s choice to use person-first language to describe themselves because people should have the right to self-identify in any way they choose. But person-first \u00a0language\u00a0is not appropriate for me. So, no. I am not at all saying that we are people before we are disordered. I am saying we aren\u2019t disordered and it is an oppression to suggest that neurominorities are disordered at all. We are people: Autistic, Bipolar, Multi-dimensional, Kinetic, Schizophrenic, and so on. If you are in one or more of these categories and you have accepted that you are ill, disordered, diseased \u2026. know that you are not required to view yourself that way. You are not required to accept society\u2019s labeling of you based on your divergence from the mainstream type of mind. You are fully permitted to embrace your natural mind, as it is, for the beautiful and creative brain you possess. read more about the Neurodiversity Movement and Mad Pride and rejoice in your uniqueness. Celebrate it. Help to forge new pathways for those who will come after you. The more that we accept and celebrate our uniqueness, the easier and safer it will be for future generations to be authentic to their natural bodies and brains. I hope that my words are somewhat less confusing now. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/what-is-a-disorder/", "title": "What Is a Disorder?"},

It\u2019s coming right at you! Photograph copyright 2016 by Sparrow Rose Jones. You can\u2019t have missed it. It\u2019s everywhere you look: the announcement that Autism Speaks has dropped the word \u201ccure\u201d from its mission statement. It\u2019s being lauded as a great sea change in the organization\u2019s approach to autism and a sign that Autism Speaks is finally starting to listen to the activists who have rejected the cure mentality for so long and called on Autism Speaks to reject it, too. \nExcept it\u2019s not a sea change. It\u2019s not a change at all. Autism Speaks hasn\u2019t changed a damned thing except their wording. \nLook at their \u00a0mission statement. The cure mindset is still front and center: Autism Speaks is dedicated to promoting solutions, across the spectrum and throughout the lifespan, for the needs of individuals with autism and their families through advocacy and support; increasing understanding and acceptance of autism spectrum disorder;\u00a0and advancing research into causes and better interventions for autism spectrum disorder\u00a0and related conditions. Autism Speaks enhances lives today and is accelerating a spectrum of solutions for tomorrow. from:\u00a0https://www.autismspeaks.org/about-us/mission Allow me to unpack this shining new mission statement. Autism Speaks is now promoting solutions instead of cures. Except that one of their definitions of solutions is not only synonymous with what \u201ccure\u201d actually meant, it is even more chilling with the new wording. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself; you\u2019ll see what I mean further on in this essay. \u201cCure\u201d was code language \u2014 something called a \u201cdog whistle\u201d because it\u2019s language meant to only be truly understood by certain people just as dog whistles can only be heard by certain ears. To the general population, \u201ccure\u201d sounds great. When you hear the word cure, you naturally think of an alleviation of suffering. You think of a cure for cancer. You think of the cure for the common cold. You think about kind-hearted, humanitarian scientists coming up with ways to soothe the discomfort and fend off death. Who could possibly be against a cure, right? Cures are good and make people happier and healthier. But what does a cure for autism look like? Autism is a difference in the structure and function of the brain. All the behavioral differences you see, all the perception differences we experience are informed by differences in neurological structure and function. The brain is the seat of our individual human identities. Autism is the ownership of an autistic brain. Curing autism would mean changing our brains. Maybe it could be done carefully and someone could cure the pain and nausea I experience when I hear certain sounds without removing the musical parts of my brain. Maybe I could be cured so that I could listen to a soprano singing without my whole body trembling in pain but would I still have been able to learn to read sheet music at age four and play Chopin sonatas on the piano and compose and record my own music? Maybe. Maybe I could be carefully and precisely cured so that I don\u2019t regularly lose the ability to speak. It would be nice to not have to type to communicate sometimes. People aren\u2019t very patient when I can only communicate by typing. They talk over me, they ignore what I tell them, they ask me five more questions while I\u2019m still typing the answer to their first question, overloading and overwhelming me. Maybe I could be cured so that I never lose speech again without removing the parts of my brain that make me a skilled writer. I am as skilled with the written word as I am because it is my first language and the spoken word is my second language. Maybe I could be cured so that I could speak all the time, reliably, without losing my writing skills. Who would I be if I weren\u2019t a writer? It is such a deep part of my personal identity, crafting written words. Anyone who has met me, heard me present, watched my YouTube videos knows that I speak well but I write so much better than I speak. Maybe my intermittent mutism could be cured without destroying my writing. Maybe. You can see where I am leading you, right? There really isn\u2019t a cure for autism. Once my brain was wired this way, my life trajectory was always going to be divergent from the bulk of life trajectories around me. Once my brain was wired in an autistic configuration, a cure would mean untangling my neurons and pasting them back together differently. Curing my autism would quite literally mean giving me a different brain. Giving me a different brain would quite literally mean erasing who I am. A \u201ccure\u201d for a living Autistic person is impossible because once you make such major changes to a person\u2019s brain, you haven\u2019t cured them; you\u2019ve removed them and replaced them with a different person who might (or might not) share their memories. If you enjoy reading science fiction, read Elizabeth Moon\u2019s novel,  The Speed of Dark , for an eerily realistic example of what a cure for autism might look like. So now I\u2019m hearing some people praising Autism Speaks for removing the word \u201ccure\u201d from their mission statement, but has anything really changed? Let\u2019s look at their new word, \u201csolution,\u201d adn see why it\u2019s much more frightening to me than \u201ccure.\u201d \n \n\u201cAutism Speaks is dedicated to promoting solutions\u201d \u2026. let\u2019s enumerate those solution goals: \n 1. across the spectrum \n 2. throughout the lifespan \n 3. for the needs of individuals with autism \n 4. for their families \n 5. through advocacy and support \n 6. increasing understanding and acceptance of\u00a0autism spectrum disorder \n 7. advancing research into causes\u00a0for autism spectrum disorder and related conditions \n 8. advancing research into better interventions\u00a0for autism spectrum disorder and related conditions \n And, for comparison, here is the old mission statement: \n \u201cWe are dedicated to funding global biomedical research into the causes, prevention, treatments and a possible cure for autism. We strive to raise public awareness about autism and its effects on individuals, families and society: and we work to bring hope to all who deal with the hardships of this disorder.\u201d \n 1. Across the Spectrum \n If these words mean what are claimed, this would be a sea change worthy of advertising. I am suspicious of all the focus on the removal of the word \u201ccure\u201d when \u201cacross the spectrum\u201d is a much bigger change. Why is no one talking about this? \n For years, those of us Autistics who could communicate using words, whether spoken or typed, were told to sit down and shut up. Autism Speaks wasn\u2019t talking about us, we were told. They were only talking about those \u2018poor unfortunates\u2019 who could not speak for themselves. Sure, we got counted whenever Autism Speaks wanted to share the huge numbers of millions of Autistics they needed funding to help. They wanted us to be counted as warm bodies for fund-raising purposes. They just wanted us to be silent warm bodies. Shut up, Autistics, you\u2019re getting in the way of us helping. \n If Autism Speaks is truly committed to offering solutions \u201cacross the spectrum,\u201d they need to look at how many of us are homeless and hungry. They need to look at how many of us are slipping through the services cracks because there\u2019s nothing out there for us. They need to look at holding universities accountable for the accommodations Autistic students need to succeed and thrive in an academic setting. There are massive unmet needs among the Autistics that Autism Speaks has traditionally told to shut up. If we really are part of their mission statement now, are they going to make good on that? Or are those just words designed to shut us up yet again. \u201cThere, we mentioned you in our mission statement. Now sit down and shut up.\u201d \n Put your money where your mouth is, Autism Speaks. And by that, I don\u2019t mean the $1,167,786 spent on catering. 1 \n Autism Speaks likes to make you think they are giving a lot of direct financial support to Autistic people and their families by rolling several categories together in their pie charts. They told us they spent $24 million on \u201cfamily services, awareness, and advocacy\u201d 2  because that hides the specifics. \n It hides the actual amount that went to family services:\u00a0$4.6 million \n Versus the amount that went to advertising: $52 million \n It hides how much of that advertising, \u201cawareness and advocacy\u201d was spent on promoting programs like MSSNG that teach the world that Autistics are \u201cmissing pieces.\u201d \u00a0Notice what they chose to leave out of the word \u201cmissing\u201d: We Autistics are missing \u201cI\u201d \u2013 identity, humanity, self. \n And what are the missing pieces that the MSSNG is discovering? Autism Speaks is sequencing thousands of genomes. \u201cThe best research minds in the world are going to mine this database of DNA so we can uncover and understand the various subtypes of autism. Then we can get to work developing customized treatments and therapies so we can improve the quality of life for so many people who need help.\u201d \u2013 Liz Feld, President, Autism Speaks. 3 \n Customized treatments and therapies? This would be great news for everyone, Autistic or not, if that\u2019s what they\u2019re actually doing. One-third of Autistics have epilepsy, so people with epilepsy would rejoice because those customized treatments would help them, too. As many as three-quarters of Autistics have clinically significant sleep disorders and that means the 25% of the general population with sleep disorders would rejoice because those customized treatments would help them, too. If MSSNG is really doing what it claims to be doing, the entire world should rejoice because the things we Autistics suffer with are not autism-exclusive things. Every treatment or therapy customized to our genetics will help thousands of non-autistic people who suffer those same things. \n Except I\u2019m not convinced. What are you developing, Autism Speaks? Will I be able to go get a genetic test and get targeted treatment for the digestive distress, neurological circadian rhythm sleep disorder, dyspraxia, anxiety disorder, and connective tissue disorder that are my genetic hitchhikers, the traveling companions of my autistic genetics? That would be a dream come true \u2014 not just for me, but for the millions of other people of all neurological profiles who also suffer these conditions and may share the particular genetics related to them. \n I think MSSNG is more likely to be part of that \u201ccure mentality\u201d Autism Speaks claims it has jettisoned by changing the wording of its mission statement. I think MSSNG is a way to detect autism in the womb. I think MSSNG is a way to provide a \u201csolution\u201d to autism\u2026.. I think MSSNG is a way to make most future Autistic children be as missing as the estimated 80% of Down Syndrome children who are not born, thanks to genetic testing. \n Prove me wrong. Fix my digestion and connective tissue and my sleep patterns that are too messed up for me to be employable. Please, do prove me wrong. \n I am part of that \u201cspectrum\u201d you now speak of reaching across. Show me the solutions. \n 2. Throughout the Lifespan \n This is another \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u201d The entire world still thinks of children when they think of autism. They think it so much that we don\u2019t ever really grow up, we become \u201cadult children.\u201d If Autism Speaks has a new commitment to \u201csolutions\u201d throughout the lifespan, let\u2019s start seeing the word \u201cadult\u201d appearing more often. Alone, as a noun. Not as an adjective to modify the noun \u201cchild.\u201d We grow up and we need help. \n What are you going to do about the 10%+ of Autistic adults who end up in the penal system? what are you going to do about the 10%+ of Autistic adults who end up homeless? What are you going to do about Autistic adults who are deemed \u201ctoo high functioning\u201d to get services but \u201ctoo low functioning\u201d to be helped by Vocational Rehabilitation? What are you going to do about the Autistic adults languishing in sheltered workshops because no one cared enough to introduce supports to help them into the mainstream workforce with real wages? What are you going to do about the Autistic adults stashed away in institutions who could be living independently in the community with adequate supports? \n You, Autism Speaks, are vacuuming up all the money from all the local communities, to the tune of $122 million per year and you are giving back only $4 million of that in actual services. You can change the wording of your mission statement all you want, but until you start helping the thousands of Autistic adults who are homeless, hungry, or imprisoned because there was nowhere for them to go and no services for them (because there was no money to help them, since it all ended up going to Autism Speaks) then your new mission statement is nothing but words designed to provide a louder and more elegant \u201csit down and shut up\u201d to the inconvenient Autistic people who actually need the help you love to pretend you are giving them. \n 3. For the Needs of Individuals With Autism \n Oh, yes. About our needs. \n We need schools to accommodate us, from pre-school to university level. We need the supports and accommodation to attend school within the community, not segregated. We need programs that understand that our academic needs and our social needs can be on radically different levels and that both those needs must be addressed or you have failed us and, by extension, all of society. \n We need to be spoken of in respectful terms, not called a tsunami or a public health crisis. Not to have our beautiful brains compared to cancer, AIDs, and diabetes. Not to be called a disease. Not to be used as inspiration porn. Not to be portrayed as the haunting menace that will destroy families, society, the economy, and all of civilization. \n \n We need real access to healthcare, not to have our co-occurring conditions dismissed as \u201cthat\u2019s just what autism is like\u201d and not to be subjected to quack treatments like bleach enemas, worms, chelation. We need medical professionals who will take the time to understand our healthcare access barriers and work with us to overcome them. We need to have it understood that having spoken communication does not automatically erase our support needs and we need to have it understood that  not  having spoken communication does not automatically erase our intelligence and autonomy. \n We need safe places to live, access to people we love, adequate healthy food to eat. We need to not be isolated from the community. We need to not have our autonomy overrun. We need help with employment for those of us who can work and we need help with financial support for those of us who cannot. All of us need support for the activities of daily living, and we need to have our support needs recognized, understood, and respected even though they can look very different from one person to the next. \n And all that\u2019s just for starters. Can you address this baseline, Autism Speaks? It\u2019s in your mission statement now. We\u2019re waiting. \n 4. For Their Families \n The number one thing our families need is to see us provided for. Our families need the peace of mind that comes from knowing we will be okay when they have passed on. Our families need to see us being educated appropriately. Our families need a level of social understanding of autism that lets them not get harassed by neighbors for living with us in their homes, that lets them go shopping or to a restaurant with us without being judged as bad parents, that lets them hire a sitter to watch us for a reasonable price. \n Presenting us as terrible burdens does not help our families. Calling us a public health crisis does not help our families. Encouraging traumatizing \u2018therapies\u2019 that create anxiety problems and PTSD in us does not help our families. \n 5. Through Advocacy and Support \n Yes, what kind did you have in mind? We don\u2019t need any more of that \u2018advocacy and support\u2019 like the \u201cI Am Autism\u201d video. We don\u2019t need to be told we\u2019re \u201cMSSNG\u201d (the two Is that are missing are the ones they are trying to pull the wool over.) We don\u2019t need to be called a tsunami or called lepers or have it said that we are so pure and innocent because we don\u2019t care about money. (I can show you an awful lot of Autistic adults who care an awful lot about money because they don\u2019t have enough to pay the rent.) \n How do you intend to advocate for us now? Is your support going to change? Are you going to spend more than the pitiful 3% of your income you currently spend on services for us and our families? Do the people who lovingly volunteer their time and resources to organize your fundraising walks realize that only three cents of every dollar they raise is actually going back to the community? \n You\u2019ve got to do much better in your advocacy and support than your track record, Autism Speaks, for anyone to take this new mission statement seriously. Where are your solutions that come through advocacy and support? What are you planning to solve? \n 6. Increasing Understanding and Acceptance of Autism Spectrum Disorder \n This is where your alleged solutions start to sound like little more than buzzwords, Autism Speaks. You have latched on to the word \u201cacceptance\u201d without understanding what it means. I know you don\u2019t understand what it means because you never would have listed this as one of your solutions if you really understood \u201cacceptance.\u201d \n Yes, we have been calling for acceptance. We have been calling for acceptance of Autistics! You are calling for acceptance of Autism Spectrum Disorder? Seriously? \n Accepting Autistics means accepting that we often look and sound and choose differently than other people but we are no less worthy of dignity and respect. Accepting Autistics means working with our patterns of strengths and struggles to help us find our way in this fast-moving and chaotic world. Accepting Autistics means making room for us at the table. We deserve to live independently in the community, with whatever supports we need to accomplish that. We deserve a chance to work, to go to school, to have a family, to shape a meaningful life \u2014 meaningful from our perspective and our needs and desires, not meaningful according to your judgment of how you think we should live. \n You are calling for accepting autism spectrum disorder. What does that even mean? How does that help us? We are different and disabled but not disordered and we do not need you to accept a disorder; we need you to accept us. If you have real solutions, they will be about accepting us, not about accepting a disorder. \n 7. Advancing Research Into Causes\u00a0for Autism Spectrum Disorder and Related Conditions \n Here! Here! Here! This is it right here! This is why your new mission statement is far more terrifying than calling for a \u201ccure.\u201d This is why your emphasis on \u201csolutions\u201d is so chilling to me! \n You want to study the causes of autism? You are dedicated to promoting solutions related to finding the causes of autism??? If you find out what causes autism, what solution are you planning to implement? Why do I keep hearing the word \u201cfinal\u201d every time I think about your solutions for the causes of autism? This is why I do not trust your shiny new mission statement. This is every bit as much entrenched in the cure mentality as your old mission statement. This is a piercing dog whistle for pre-natal testing and abortion. \n This is why I read your new mission statement and I still see a huge organization draining all the money from local communities \u2014 money that could have helped us, our families, our schools, our vocational aspirations, our future \u2014 and using that money to research how to kill us before we are born. \n This is why I say you have not changed a damned thing. You have slapped a fresh coat of paint on the same terrifying eugenics agenda you\u2019ve always had, Autism Speaks. \n You only took the word \u201ccure\u201d out of your mission statement. You did not remove the hatred of our existence. You might have fooled some people, but you aren\u2019t fooling me. \n 8. Advancing Research Into Better Interventions\u00a0for Autism Spectrum Disorder and Related Conditions \n Meet the new torment; same as the old torment. Are these the better interventions that strip away our autonomy more efficiently, leaving us even more vulnerable to predators? Or is this more support for \u201ctreatment centers\u201d that use electric shock on us? Or are these the better interventions that prevent us from being born in the first place? \n No thank you, Autism Speaks. You have to do more than draft some buzzier buzzwords for me to trust you. \n In fact, I think I agree with my friends who have said that the only thing you could possibly do at this point to win our trust is completely dismantle and donate all your money to other organizations that are Autistic-led and doing the real work to make our actual lives better. \n Who cares what causes autism? What good can it do Autistics to learn why we exist? We are grossly under served \u2014 all of us, \u201cacross the spectrum and throughout the lifespan\u201d are not getting what we need to thrive and you are taking the money and volunteer time that could help bridge that gap and throwing it at research designed to eradicate us. \n No. You have not changed a damned thing. I still don\u2019t trust you. I still don\u2019t trust those who support you. \n All the carefully worded mission statements in the world will not change that. \n \n \n \n 1.\u00a0https://www.autismspeaks.org/sites/default/files/docs/final_autism_speaks_2014_28229.pdf \n2.\u00a0https://www.autismspeaks.org/sites/default/files/docs/annual_report_9-11.pdf \n 3.\u00a0https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/autism-speaks-launches-mssng-groundbreaking-genome-sequencing-program \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/autism-speaks-hasnt-really-changed-anything/", "title": "Autism Speaks Hasn\u2019t Really Changed Anything"},

I mentioned that there has been a small amount of research in that area and others were eager to know more. Since multiple people wanted that information, I decided to make a brief annotated bibliography in a blog post to more easily share it with as many people as would like to see.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\t\t\t\t\t [image description: a photo of Wolf Lake in Sebring, Florida, taken by Sparrow Rose Jones. It has nothing to do with either autism or trauma, but it\u2019s pretty and the author enjoys including an image with their writing.] Autism, Awareness Campaigns, and the Mental Health System \u00a0( slides ) As you might imagine, the bulk of the available research (and there isn\u2019t a lot of it yet \u2014 I definitely agree that we need more research into multiple aspects of autism and trauma) focuses on the role of the amygdala in stress and trauma imprinting. There are two main aspects of showing an autistic predisposition for trauma: showing the role of the amygdala in sustaining trauma, and showing the ways that the autistic amygdala is different in structure and/or function, thus exacerbating that brain structure\u2019s role in trauma. Some of the following research is of one type or the other, much addresses both halves of the equation. -=- Some assessments of the amygdala role in suprahypothalamic neuroendocrine regulation: a minireview This article has little\u00a0to do with autism specifically. I am including it in this annotated bibliography because it does a good job of explaining the role of the amygdala for those who don\u2019t have a neuroscience background and thus may not instantly know why the amygdala is important in considering the autistic risk for trauma. As the abstract says, \u201cThe amygdala plays a key role in what has been called the \u201cgeneral-purpose  defense response  control network\u201d and reacts in response to unpleasant sights, sensations, or smells. Anger, avoidance, and defensiveness are emotions activated largely by the amygdala.\u201d The Basolateral Amygdala c-Aminobutyric Acidergic System in Health and Disease This research review\u00a0article from 2016 is the main \u201csmoking gun\u201d I was referring to when I mentioned that there has been some research already that has found a higher risk of trauma among Autistics. \u201cThis Review discusses the anatomy, development, and physiology of the GABAergic system in the BLA and circuits that modulate GABAergic inhibition, including the dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic systems.\u201d That\u2019s a lot for those of us who are not biochemists, but I\u2019m going to try to boil it down a little bit. The article says that Autistics, along with a few other categories of neurodivergents (Alzheimer\u2019s, TBI, epilepsy) have hyperexcitability in our amygdala. That means the neurons in our amygdalas are firing much more often than neurons in the amygdalas of the general population and that this increased amygdala function leads to anxiety and \u201cthe development of neurological and/or neuropsychiatric diseases.\u201d In Autistics, GABA metabolism is reduced and certain GABA receptors are delayed in their maturation. The authors point out that a reduction in GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition (a reduction in \u2018less neurons firing because GABA \u201ccalms them down\u201d\u2018) is linked to an increase in anxiety. The hyperactivity of the amygdala not only increases anxiety but greatly increases the risk of developing PTSD. The review goes on to say that benzodiazepines (which are commonly given to people experiencing anxiety and/or PTSD) may not be effective in Autistics because their mode of action relies on the same GABA receptors that take longer to develop in Autistic people than in the general population. The authors are careful to point out that they are not arguing that hyperactivity in the amygdala results in PTSD but simply to point out the role of GABA in PTSD and the action (or lower action, as it were) of GABA in the autistic brain creates an environment more likely to result in PTSD and other anxiety disorders. They suggest the need for research into deeper understanding of the role of GABA and the possibility of developing therapies that increase the growth of interneurons that could reduce the excitation of neurons in the amygdala. The Result of Traumatizing Events on a Child With Autism Although the 2016 GABA\u00a0review is new, knowledge of the role of the amygdala in autistic trauma has been around for a while. This is a 2008 statement by Dr. David Larson Holmes who, unfortunately, does not include citations when he writes, \u201cRecent studies have confirmed that children with autism have very active Amygdalas; the center of the brain that stores traumatic events. This center is directly connected to the brain stem [reticular formation] which is the area of the brain stimulated during potentially threatening conditions and places the child in a \u2018fight or flight\u2019 condition. [\u2026]\u00a0Upon further analysis of the brain activity of children with autism it has been found that the Hippocampus, the center of the brain which stores pleasant experiences, is actually much less active than the children\u2019s Amygdalas. This has resulted in a supposition that children with autism are affected more from traumatizing events than pleasant events and that the traumatizing events have greater robustness; thereby maintaining a greater degree of panic and fear in the child than what would be found in typically developing children.\u201d Amygdala and Hippocampus Enlargement During Adolescence in Autism Strictly speaking, this 2010 study doesn\u2019t indicate anything about increased risk of trauma. I\u2019m including it because it\u2019s an example of a structural difference in the amygdala between Autistics and the general population. The authors are unsure whether the increase in the size of brain structures causes emotional differences or whether the \u201cincreased emotional learning\u201d Autistics go through when compared to the general population is the cause of the structural changes. Amygdala Subregional Structure and Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Predicts Individual Differences in Anxiety During Early Childhood This article is not about autism or Autistics, although the lead researcher, Vinod Menon, has conducted other research that does focus on Autistics. This 2013 paper ties in with the uncited claims above of Dr. Holmes, as well as the 2010 study directly above about amygdala size increases in Autistics during adolescence (an emotionally difficult time for nearly anyone of any neurological profile.) The study found that the larger the amygdala, and the more connectivity between the amygdala and other neurological structures, the higher the anxiety rate in children and the greater the risk of anxiety disorders developing later. In addition to the human study upon which this article was based, \u201cStudies of laboratory animals placed in an environment causing chronic stress have determined that the animals\u2019 amygdalae grew additional synapses and that synaptic connectivity increased in response to the resulting persistent anxiety.\u201d This suggests that what the authors of the 2010 study were calling \u201cincreased emotional learning\u201d in adolescence was actually a burden of chronic stress and anxiety, causing the amygdala to grow larger than non-autistic controls. -=- All of this information is pieced together and none of it is so clear cut as the 2016 GABA\u00a0minireview, but taken together, they paint a strong portrait of the greater trauma risk Autistics face and the great need for further research into the nature and causes of trauma in Autistics.

It has been slightly edited for grammar, clarity, and availability of external links, but not for content. Autistic Inertia: An Overview I was talking with my boyfriend yesterday about autistic inertia. I was describing how it affects me and bemoaning the fact that it\u2019s so clearly a real thing that exists but I never see researchers or educators talking about it \u2014 just us Autistics. We know it exists, we know it\u2019s a real thing, but it\u2019s not in the official literature and no one is researching it. After I described it a bit, my boyfriend remarked upon how similar it sounds to what people with Parkinson\u2019s experience. Upon reflection, that didn\u2019t surprise me too much since Parkinson\u2019s is linked to dopamine and I\u2019ve read autism research that talks about irregularities in dopamine and seratonin in the autistic brain. He did a little searching and found a study using Parkinson\u2019s medications on autistic people that reported little improvement. But he also remarked that if the researchers weren\u2019t specifically looking for improvement in autistic inertia, they may have missed some of the effects of the medication. I promised my boyfriend that I would send him some links to things fellow Autistics have written about autistic inertia. At the same time, I realized it\u2019s been a while since I updated my blog and so I thought I would just share the information here in case it\u2019s helpful to more people than just myself and my amazing boyfriend who is always so willing to go out of his way to understand me better. The first thing I ever read about autistic inertia was Anna Sullivan\u2019s handout from her presentation at Autreat 2002:  Inertia: From Theory to Praxis . Sullivan talks about the different manifestations of inertia and her descriptions make it clear that inertia is not one single thing. From what I can see, there are elements of executive dysfunction, of low energy/hypotonia, and of being out of touch with one\u2019s body and emotions. And this is just the beginning, from what I can tell. One thing Sullivan doesn\u2019t mention, though, is the idea that inertia is a difficulty in \u201cchanging gears.\u201d You will see the professionals talking about \u201cgear changing\u201d issues sometimes and that\u2019s a part of inertia, although not all of it. Also, Sullivan doesn\u2019t mention that inertia in autistics is not dissimilar to Newton\u2019s inertia, in that not only do we have difficulty starting things if we\u2019re stopped but we also have difficulty in stopping things if we\u2019re started. As I told my boyfriend yesterday, when I start researching for a paper, I have a hard time stopping the research and starting the writing. So I will end up with enough research material for seven papers before I ever manage to make myself stop researching and start organizing my material and writing it out. It does mean that my papers tend to be really good since I know far more than I end up putting in writing. But it also means that it doesn\u2019t matter how early I manage to start working on a paper, I will always be scrambling to finish it at the last minute. Something very important that Sullivan points out is the unevenness of skill sets in autistics. That is, an autistic person might be able to do something easily one day but run up against severe inertia with the same task on another day. Autism isn\u2019t something constant and steady-state\u00a0but rather something variable, more like multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, or lupus. What we can do one day, we can\u2019t do every day. What we can\u2019t do one day, we might be able to do on another. This, in my experience, has been one of the hardest things for people around me to grasp. People seem to expect some sort of constancy and consistency in the people around them and I\u2019m just not able to provide that steady, constant level of skill and ability. Some days I easily \u201cpass\u201d for non-autistic while other days I am quite obviously Autistic, no matter who you ask. Sullivan ends with a suggested reading list. Since the article is older, one item on the list might be supplanted with a newer book. Sullivan lists \u201cPunished by Rewards\u201d by Alfie Kohn but I might recommend also reading (or reading instead) \u201cDrive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\u201d by Daniel H. Pink. Sullivan mentions a posting from Kalen and it\u2019s really good so it should be on the to-read list as well:  Inertia: by Kalen . Kalen writes about inertia from a more Newtonian perspective, including both getting stuck within a task as well as getting stuck trying to do a task. Kalen also mentions how disabling inertia can be in a person\u2019s life. It was a relief for me to read someone else describing inertia that way because it has certainly prevented me from doing many things I really wanted to do and it\u2019s hard not to feel lazy or inadequate about one\u2019s own inertia without the proper understanding of what it really is and what it really means. Kalen describes inertia as \u201ca combination of attention shifting and motor planning difficulties\u201d which definitely resonates with my experience. There are times when I am only able to act by willing my body to perform and just as many times when I cannot get my body to perform, no matter how much will I exert. When I lose the ability to speak, I can think about the sounds that I want to create. I can think about the ways my mouth and throat and lungs move when I generate those sounds. But I cannot will my body to speak. It is as baffling to me as it is to those around me, but I can think the words \u2014 I can even type the words \u2014 but I cannot speak the words when I am in a state of \u201cspeaking inertia.\u201d Just as there are times when those around me feel I might never shut up, there are times when it seems I might never speak again. Kalen offers a few suggestions for how to work with or around inertia, warning that not all suggestions will work for all people, nor will a suggestion that works sometimes for someone work every time or in every situation for that person. Aspergia Jones writes about the idea that autistic \u201cspecial interests\u201d might actually be a form of inertia in her  blog entry on her site, Letters from Aspergia . She talks about inertia as a sort of \u201cstuckness\u201d and mentions how much more we Autistics tend to get overtaken by \u201cear worms\u201d \u2014 music stuck in the head. Or movies stuck in the head. Or anything stuck in the head. I have gotten stuck on a word or phrase and ended up repeating it over and over. In my opinion, yes, \u201cstuckness\u201d is inertia, whether it\u2019s being stuck on a special interest or stuck on song lyrics or just stuck. In the original version of this blog post, Aspergia Jones posted a comment: \n Thanks for the link! You\u2019re right, very very little is written about autistic inertia, even though it really is A Thing \u2013 personally, it can be more disabling than the social stuff. I think the research tends to concentrate on the things about autism that are a problem for or seem weird to neurotypical folk, like stimming and differences in social interaction. Things that affect us deeply but don\u2019t affect those around us \u2013 like sensory/motor stuff and inertia \u2013 get a lot less press. Although, just as with every other aspect of autism, it is easy to assume that all difficulties\u00a0trace back to an autistic trait even when they don\u2019t. On LiveJournal, ChaoticIdealism writes about  Autistic Inertia & Sleep  in a way that makes it clear to me that they are living with Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder and assuming it\u2019s actually a manifestation of autistic inertia. I can really relate to that since I originally thought that my own Non-24 Disorder was actually Autistic Burn-out. (That\u2019s a whole different blog entry, but you can read about autistic burnout in Amanda Baggs\u2019 excellent essay  Help! I seem to be Getting More Autistic! ) Ali/Eliot writes about inertia and perseveration as two sides of the same coin in his blog entry, Stare Up at the Sky. He talks about how difficult it can be to make decisions \u2014 everything from big decisions like buying a new laptop to little decisions like what to eat for lunch. He talks a bit about how his partner, Kitty, does thing to make it easier for him to eat regularly and make other decisions. This blog entry is no longer available. In the original post of this blog entry, Ali wrote a comment: \n The post you\u2019re referencing of mine is a couple of years old, and my thoughts haven\u2019t drastically changed so much as refined a little. Inertia and choice paralysis (which isn\u2019t a term I used in that entry but I think is self explanatory?) also happen for people who are perfectionists\u2013and I\u2019m that, too. The basis is entirely different, at least in me. Autistic inertia is most of what I listed in the post originally: needing external or internal prompting to begin or end a task (or part of a task), where task is a value-neutral word for any possible thing you could be doing. The perfectionist inertia is more about the choice paralysis: you can\u2019t pick which option because one of them will be the wrong option or at least not optimal, so until you have all the data ever you\u2019re stuck. I think my long example in the post about laptop purchasing is actually more related to perfectionism than to autism. \n There\u2019s overlap between the two, but thinking about them as separate things has helped me sort out what I can consciously change (the perfectionist stuff) and what I can\u2019t or find very difficult to change (like remembering to eat if I\u2019m distracted). And it\u2019s been almost like there\u2019s inertia about my inertia: when I can handle the perfectionist stuff, it makes it easier to brain together some of the physical inertia or get the song I\u2019ve had stuck for over a week out of my head. Andrea has a few tips on how to battle inertia in her blog entry  Coping With the Inertia of Task Paralysis . But, as a commenter points out: \u201cGreat ideas, Andrea, but how the heck am I going to remember to do all that? I have a hard enough time remembering to remember and now I\u2019m supposed to remember the reminders for remembering? Help! I\u2019m trapped in an infinite regress!\u201d I\u2019m sure there is much more out there on autistic inertia, but the above is a fair introduction to the topic. Please do discuss this in the comments! I really want to hear from anyone and everyone about inertia, whether it\u2019s personal experiences or scientific (or even pseudo-scientific) theories.

The river looks inscrutable\u00a0and the way to it is mostly inaccessible, due to scrubby weeds and aging concrete structures.] It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have the money to go. I currently have some amazing insurance through Florida Medicaid. I pretty much have my pick of therapists, but I can\u2019t go. This is going to be difficult for me really soon because I need to go to a gender therapist to prove I\u2019m \u201cstable\u201d enough to be allowed to medically transition. I am concerned. I am concerned because  Kayden Clarke was killed  by the police during a suicidal episode triggered by being told he could not have access to medical gender transition until his autism was \u201ccured\u201d (which, as you already know, translates to \u201cnever.\u201d) I fear facing similar barriers in my own efforts to get my medical and psychological needs appropriately addressed. I am required to go to therapy; I cannot go to a therapist. The reason I can\u2019t go to therapy is because I am living with the C-PTSD that has resulted from years of iatrogenic damage resulting from childhood therapy.  I\u2019m going to unpack that sentence now, because it probably has some terms you aren\u2019t familiar with and because I just put a decade of pain and a lifetime of aftermath into one sentence. Bear with me, gentle reader. It is impossible to talk about these things and almost as difficult to write about them. C-PTSD is  Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder . It is not yet officially in the DSM, but there was strong debate during the shaping of the DSM-5 and  C-PTSD was included  in a subsection under PTSD. Childhood therapy is not my only source of C-PTSD, but it was a strong contributor. I encourage you to do some reading about C-PTSD and reflect on the symptoms carefully. The symptom picture will probably look familiar to you. I believe that recognition comes from the large overlap between C-PTSD symptoms and descriptions of autism. I believe that large overlap comes from the amount of trauma that so many Autistic people grow up with. The Summer 1998 issue of  The Communicator , the newsletter of the Autism National Committee (AUTCOM), includes a quote from the book  Learning to Listen \u00a0(1996) by Dr. Herb Lovett: People who have been hurt in the name of therapy may not understand their plight any differently than survivors of cult abuse or sexual abuse. A common feature of post-traumatic stress syndrome is the flashback in which a person acts as if a memory is present reality\u2026. every time they recall their previous maltreatment, unless their panic and rage are recognized as a function of stress, they are likely to be further stigmatized as \u201cimpossible to serve.\u201d \u2013 from\u00a0 Can Aversives and Restraints Produce PTSD in People with Autism? In addition to the trauma of being helpless and subjected to difficult therapies, Autistics have an extra obstacle when it comes to trauma, due to having a nervous system that is different from that of the majority of people and living in a world where we are \u201cneurologically outnumbered,\u201d as  Carol Greenburg  so aptly puts it. Just living in this world, with its sensory content that leaves Autistics overloaded and underfed in varying patterns and to varying degrees can be filled with trauma-triggering events that seem ordinary to people with nervous systems tuned more to the keys found in the majority of people. Ariane Zurcher has already written about our very active amygdalas and the risk of trauma. Rather than \u201cre-invent the wheel,\u201d I invite you to read her essay on  Trauma & Autism . I don\u2019t believe that all therapists are bad. I don\u2019t believe that all therapists who work specifically with Autistic children, teens, and adults are bad. I believe there are good therapists and helpful therapists.  It wouldn\u2019t be so upsetting to me that I can\u2019t go to a therapist if I thought they were all bad and unhelpful. I would love to find a good therapist to help me work through my issues. I would especially love to find a good therapist who can help me with my medical gender transition. I am not telling people to give up \u00a0on finding a therapist for their Autistic child. If your child needs help with one or more aspects of life, there\u2019s nothing wrong with looking for a trained professional to help. What I am saying is that therapy should center around what your child needs and should serve your child\u2019s best interests. I have experienced trauma in childhood therapy and it still haunts me and overshadows my life. I have witnessed Autistic children traumatized by bad therapy and the suffering was real and very visible. The entire family suffers when a child is traumatized by careless or harmful therapy, but the child suffers the most, of course. It makes me heartsick when I see it and I would give anything to save children and their families from those experiences. Iatrogenic damage is damage that is caused by medical examination or treatment. What I am saying when I call my trauma iatrogenic is that it was directly caused by years of therapy. This is not as radical as it might sound. The mental health field  acknowledges , albeit quietly, that  therapy can lead to iatrogenic damage .  Boisvert and Faust  (2002) write that, \u201cIatrogenic symptoms may originate through the over-reliance on a belief system within which therapists interpret, reinterpret, or label clients\u2019 characteristics or distress as pathological. Therapeutic communication that emphasizes pejorative language may introduce clients to this belief system.\u201d This ties directly into the message of autism acceptance \u2014 so many Autistic adults (including myself) have told the world how harmful pathologizing language is. \u00a0These researchers have written an academic article that backs our claim up. The evidence I\u2019m sharing here is mainly about mainstream psychotherapy. It\u2019s pretty intense data:  Dr. Allen J \u00a0Francis  estimates that as\u00a0many as 15% of psychotherapy patients worsen with treatment. When you add in the special situations that arise in autism therapy,\u00a0how much does that estimate rise? I\u2019m asking you to avoid therapies that teach your child that they are lesser or broken in some way.  I\u2019m asking you to avoid therapies that teach your child that the ways they move or communicate are\u00a0wrong when those ways do not harm anyone and are being changed because they \u201clook odd\u201d \u00a0or make others uncomfortable for non-harmful reasons. I\u2019m asking you to avoid therapies that take away your child\u2019s ability to set boundaries and enforce them. And I\u2019m warning you about the life-long damage that can come from inappropriate therapies. I actively need to go to therapy and cannot because of the damage I have sustained in childhood therapy. I enter a therapist\u2019s office and start crying uncontrollably and can\u2019t stop until I leave. Therapy is dangerous for me because therapists see that reaction and, understandably, want to have me committed on the spot. My ability to benefit from therapy has been stripped from me, leaving me with fewer tools for coping with life and fewer mentors trained to help me thrive. The damage inflicted in childhood can last a lifetime. Approach therapy with caution and always keep your child\u2019s best interests foremost. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/the-fruits-of-damaging-childhood-therapy/", "title": "The Fruits of Damaging Childhood Therapy"},

Just as apples can be different yet all be apples, people can be different yet all be fully human. You can\u2019t support someone\u2019s differences by pretending they don\u2019t exist. (Originally posted December 5, 2015) You\u2019ve heard someone say this before, right? \u201cOh, well, autism is a spectrum and I think that means that, really, everyone\u2019s a little bit autistic.\u201d Now, I can see why someone might say that. I said something in my first book,  No You Don\u2019t: Essays from an Unstrange Mind , that might seem to support that idea: \u201cAnd if you aren\u2019t Autistic, don\u2019t be surprised if you recognize pieces of yourself in here, too. Because autism is a difference of intensity and frequency but above all, it is a slice of the human condition. If you are human, you will recognize yourself in some of the things I write.\u201d This passage does not say that everyone is a little autistic. It says that Autistics are human beings. As my book says a couple of pages later, we are not \u201ca different species, an alien creature, a changeling, a robot, a freak of nature.\u201d We are human beings and so much of what we experience is fundamental to the human condition. Our autistic nervous system affects how we experience our humanity \u2014 our experience is often heightened in intensity and colored by our different perspectives on life. But it is humanity we are experiencing because we are fully human. The converse of \u201call Autistics are human\u201d\u00a0\u2014 \u201call humans are Autistics\u201d \u2014 is not implied and does not hold. When I say all Autistics are fully human (which, in case you were doubting, we are!) I am in no way implying that all humans are autistic . . . not even a little bit. People see that Autistics are human and that we often experience very intense versions of basic human experiences \u2014 anxiety, for example. We often carry a lot of anxiety and we get stressed out and we meltdown from high stress. Since everyone has felt anxious at some point and everyone has felt overloaded with stress and everyone has \u201clost their shit\u201d at one point or another, some people get mixed up and decide that sharing such a common experience as a stress and anxiety meltdown means that they are \u201ca little autistic\u201d too. But that is not true and it is a diminishing thing to say, particularly to Autistic people. If everyone were a little bit autistic, Salvation Army bell ringers would be illegal. If everyone were a little bit autistic, nothing ever would have strobe lights. Ever. Fluorescent lights, sirens,\u00a0shirt tags, sock seams\u00a0\u2014 these wouldn\u2019t exist. There would be a strong social taboo against dragging a chair across the floor and making that horrible scraping sound with it. Perfume and cologne would be outlawed as hazardous substances and every school and workplace would have a quiet zone for recuperation. How we handled turn-taking would not involve long lines of people standing scrunched up close to each other. In short, if everybody were a little autistic, our whole society would look a great deal different than it does. Experiencing a taste of what we live with does not make someone autistic, not even a little bit. It would be like me saying that, because I sometimes lose the ability to speak and need to type in order to communicate, I completely understand the lived experience of being an Autistic who never communicates with their voice. I can guess at the experience, but I do not live it. I have intermittent mutism and that does not make me \u201ca little non-speaking\u201d any more than someone who hates standing in lines or even someone who lives with daily anxiety is automatically \u201ca little autistic.\u201d The struggles I face are not the struggles\u00a0others who have never spoken experience. The struggles non-autistic people face may have some\u00a0surface similarities to\u00a0struggles Autistics live with but that does not make\u00a0someone \u201ca little bit autistic.\u201d The only way I know to communicate how dismissive it is to say something like \u201cwe are all a little autistic\u201d is to shift the whole idea into the context of some other disabilities: \u201cSometimes I am looking for something and it\u2019s right in front of me and I just kept missing it even when I was looking right at it. We\u2019re all a little Blind, aren\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cThe other day, I was sitting funny and my foot fell asleep. When I stood up, I almost fell down from the pins and needles. I guess we\u2019re all a little paralyzed, huh?\u201d Those are ridiculous things to say. But so often I hear people saying analogous things, and not just about autism. How about, \u201cI have to keep my house so clean and everything put away. I am so OCD!\u201d Or \u201cI am completely addicted to Sudoku puzzles!\u201d Have you heard, \u201cI can\u2019t make up my mind. I just keep going back and forth I\u2019m so schizophrenic.\u201d Or, just as bad, the words are applied to something inanimate: \u201cRain, then sun, then rain, then sun. The weather is so bipolar today!\u201d Don\u2019t do this! When you use someone else\u2019s disability as an adjective for your quirks or otherwise reduce it to a one-dimensional descriptor,\u00a0you are making light of their entire life. And when you say everyone is a little bit autistic, you are trivializing what it actually means to be Autistic. I understand that some people have good intentions. They want to highlight the humanity of Autistics. Be careful \u2014 this is how person-first language arose: through an overzealous urge to bludgeon others with a disabled person\u2019s humanity for fear that no one could see it otherwise. Others may be saying they are a little autistic in order to show solidarity with people they view as \u201cfighting the good fight.\u201d I\u2019d like to show solidarity with People of Color but I would never dream of saying we\u2019re all a little bit Asian or everyone is Native American inside or I\u2019m a little Black. So don\u2019t try to appropriate my disability just to show solidarity with me. I will appreciate your support just fine if you just try to pay attention and be sensitive. You can\u2019t support my differences by pretending they don\u2019t exist.

I\u2019m an open book about this book I\u2019ve opened. [image description: photo of the pages of an opened book] Autism and the DSM 5:\u00a0Development and Course: Part 4 originally published October 26, 2013 Index \n Part 1: Losing Your Diagnosis?\u00a0 \n Part 2: Diagnostic Criteria: Section A \n Part 3: Diagnostic Criteria: Section B \n Part 4: Diagnostic Criteria: Section C \n Part 5: Diagnostic Criteria: Section D \n Part 6:\u00a0Diagnostic Criteria: Section E and Severity Levels \n Part 7: Development and Course: Part 1 \n Part 8: Development and Course: Part 2 \n Part 9: Development and Course: Part 3 \nPart 10:\u00a0(you are here) After a pause to blog about other things, I\u2019m back with some more examination of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism and related discussion points. I\u2019m still working my way through the Development and Course section, which has seven paragraphs. Today, I look at paragraph four: Deafness may be suspected but is typically ruled out. During the second year, odd and repetitive behaviors and the absence of typical play become more apparent. Since many typically developing young children have strong preferences and enjoy repetition (e.g., eating the same foods, watching the same video multiple times), distinguishing restricted and repetitive behaviors that are diagnostic of autism spectrum disorder can be difficult in preschoolers. The clinical distinction is based on the type, frequency, and intensity of the behavior (e.g., a child who daily lines up objects for hours and is very distressed if any item is moved). The reference to deafness is based on our reputation for not responding to our name when it is called out. I think the most common reason for this is that we can get so focused in on what we\u2019re thinking about or looking at that we close off the senses we aren\u2019t using. Or, if we\u2019re using our hearing to focus in on something, it\u2019s hard for something else to break through to us. We tend not to have the same kind of sensory filters that non-autistic people have, so many of us don\u2019t have the \u201ccocktail party effect\u201d \u00a0that makes voices stand out to us against a background of other sounds. I have seen  research that tries to claim that human voices are \u201cless important\u201d \u00a0to us than other sounds , but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a completely accurate interpretation for how we respond (or don\u2019t respond) to voices. The article I linked to claims we aren\u2019t \u201cmotivated\u201d by human voices. I think they are mixing up cause and effect and the truth is more likely that we aren\u2019t as \u201cmotivated\u201d by voices because we don\u2019t hear them as well. On top of everything I mentioned in the previous paragraph, many of us also have some amount of CAPD (central auditory processing disorder) which seems to most strongly affect cognition in the range of human voices. I know that I can listen to music with a finely-tuned musician\u2019s ear and hear every little nuance of sound but someone speaking can get very garbled very quickly. I\u2019m not so good with telephones but can usually do well in a one-on-one conversation on Skype with a headset because the sound quality is better and always coming straight into my ears. In the open environment of a room, my hearing ability quickly degrades, especially if there are multiple people speaking at once or a noisy environment like\u00a0 a restaurant with lots of piped in music, dishes rattling, etc. I have surprised people when I have been sitting in a restaurant and started pointing out sounds to them \u2014 naming the song playing over the speakers above (\u201cI didn\u2019t even hear music at all!\u201d) the sizzle of the grill in the kitchen (\u201coh! I hear it now that you point it out. But it\u2019s so faint! How did you hear that?\u201d) \u2014 yet I struggle to understand the speech of my dining companion sitting right next to me. I have no auditory filters \u2014 I hear EVERYTHING, all at once \u2014 and I have CAPD, so speech gets mixed up. (Think of CAPD as being something similar to having dyslexia of the ear.) So, yeah, I probably have less neurological \u201cpleasure reward\u201d from voices, too. Even though I love the rich, chocolate sound of my boyfriend\u2019s voice. Even though I can often identify people by their voice alone (a nice compensation for being blind to faces.) I\u2019m not less motivated by voices, I just have a really hard time hearing and understanding the darned things! So I suspect the actual issue with appearing deaf and\u00a0not responding to hearing our name called is simply that we really don\u2019t hear it. Some people seem to have a hard time understanding how our sensory perceptions work. It\u2019s hard to fault them for that, since that \u201d how\u201d \u00a0is actually a very individual thing. There are some commonalities, yes, but the overall pattern of hyper-sensitivities, hypo-sensitivities, changing sensitivities? That is excruciatingly individual. Every single thing I ever say about how my senses take in and interpret the world? There are Autistic people just like that and there are Autistic people not like that at all. Take me as a general guidepost but not a perfectly representative map. Again, we see a mention that autistic behaviors can become more apparent in the second year of life. This is significant because it correlates with some vaccination times and could cause confusion in people who believe that autism is caused by vaccinations. The amount of change can be really dramatic, though. Some Autistic kids gradually reveal their autism as they grow and don\u2019t make milestones on the same timetable as their age peers. Other Autistic kids really do change a lot, though. I\u2019ve seen the video and photographic evidence: before age two (or so) the child is speaking, smiling, laughing. After age two (or so), the child no longer speaks, no longer smiles, and exhibits a marked loss of emotional affect. Science still has a lot of exploration to do before it begins to understand the development and course of autism. When I look back at my childhood photos, I see myself laughing and smiling at age one and two but mostly deadpan, sullen, mournful afterwards. In my case it\u2019s really hard to determine what\u2019s what, though. I definitely became less bubbly when I started school because of the stress of it. The further along I got in school, the more stressful it became and the more my default affect became that of a dog that\u2019s been kicked one too many times. I also had a brother who spent most of my childhood dying and completed the task just before I turned seven. So it\u2019s impossible to look at my childhood facial expressions and determine what might be a sign of autism and what is just a general sign of a miserable childhood. I find it interesting that now that I am an adult, I frequently get asked what I\u2019m angry about or what\u2019s wrong when I\u2019m feeling calm and peaceful and happy. I am definitely a sufferer of \u201c Bitchy Resting Face .\u201d\u00a0Either my face developed the habit of looking unhappy all the time (except when I\u2019m laughing or when I\u2019m paying attention to making my face look pleasant) as a result of years of suffering or I really do have affect issues and my default, relaxed, no-affect face looks gloomy to others who are so accustomed to all faces having stories written on them that they are still trying to read mine even when it\u2019s just a blank page. Or I could just have, you know, Bitchy Resting Face. Another point the DSM-5 makes is that many of the repetitive practices of autism are common to all small children. This is an echo of what I (and many others) are often saying: that autism is not so alien. The things we do are mostly things all people do. We just do them more often and with more intensity. My sister is not autistic. When she was about two years old, she memorized every commercial on television. She is quite bright so she only needed to hear them once to have them completely memorized. She would gallop through the house on all fours, pretending to be a horse, singing commercial jingles at the top of her lungs. If you said something that had two or three of the words of a song from a commercial in a row, she\u2019d start singing the whole jingle. My sister was deeply obsessed with television commercials and repeated them all day long. But for a two-year-old, that is normal behavior. I used to know an Autistic boy who behaved the same way at age twelve. He memorized commercials and entire television and movie scripts. Almost everything he ever said was a line from a movie. The technical term is echolalia, but when you read about echolalia, so much of the literature claims that the people engaging in it are not making sense and are just randomly speaking nonsense. In my experience with \u201cKyle,\u201d \u00a0that was not the case at all. Kyle was always communicating when he repeated movie scripts. If you looked past the fact that someone else had written the words he was using, you could clearly see that they were his words \u2014 he had made them his own. And he was always matching quoted phrases to the situations he was in.\u00a0For example, if you were serving him at Thanksgiving and asked him if he preferred\u00a0breast meat or dark meat he might answer by quoting Freddy Krueger from the horror film, \u201cFreddy vs. Jason\u201d:\u00a0 \u201cHow sweet! Dark meat!\u201d (In the creepy Freddy voice and everything!) Not everything Kyle said was so easy to interpret as that, but every quote he\u00a0recited had meaning for\u00a0him, regardless of whether those of us around him could accurately interpret it\u00a0or not.\u00a0All I can say about researchers and other professionals who claim that repetitive movie quoting is random and pointless is \u201cwhat we have here is failure to communicate \u2014 some men you just can\u2019t reach.\u201d \u00a0And, in case I\u2019m not being clear the failure is on the part of the professionals. The \u201cecholalic\u201d is doing just fine . . . for anyone who is willing to really listen and presume competence and communication. So there\u2019s my take on paragraph four. I\u2019ll be back with the next paragraph and on through the rest of the DSM-5 entry.

It\u2019s given all of us a chance to look more closely at what\u2019s in the DSM-5, it\u2019s given me a chance to explore related themes that are very important and interesting to me, and it\u2019s given others a chance to process some of the things going on in their own lives. I encourage everyone to look back at the comment sections of previous entries in this series where there are some great discussions of diagnostic issues and issues related to living with autism or helping a loved one with their experience of living with autism. The last entry has an especially interesting discussion in which a reader shared her concerns for her dear son who has gained and lost speech skills twice now. I would love to see more people enter that conversation with words of support or shared information or similar experiences. I love it when all of you come together and help each other. It makes me feel really good to facilitate a place where those kinds of conversations and connections can occur! Today I\u2019m going to look at the third paragraph in the Development and Course section of the Autism Spectrum Disorder discussion section of the DSM-5: First symptoms of autism spectrum disorder frequently involve delayed language development, often accompanied by lack of social interest or unusual social interactions (e.g., pulling individuals by the hand without any attempt to look at them), odd play patterns (e.g., carrying toys around but never playing with them), and unusual communication patterns (e.g., knowing the alphabet but not responding to own name). When I look at descriptions like this, my first instinct is to think back on my own childhood. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a first response for my readers who are also Autistic (and maybe some who aren\u2019t) and I\u2019m assuming that parents of Autistic children immediately think about their own child\u2019s early development when they read a paragraph like that one. Most of my symptoms didn\u2019t really get noticeable until I went to pre-school because at school there were a lot of other children to compare me to. Also, school was much louder, more chaotic, more crowded, and generally more disturbing to me than life at home. But while things didn\u2019t really get serious for me until I was four, there were earlier signs. I did have social interest \u2014 I doted on my older brother. I don\u2019t remember unusual social interactions in my early years but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything because I\u2019m often told that something I did or said was strange or disturbing\u00a0now as an adult when I had not realized that I was doing or saying anything out of the ordinary at all. So I\u2019m not sure whether I would recognize unusual social interactions from my early childhood. I remember a lot of what, looking back, were very unusual social interactions from age 4 on, but I don\u2019t have a lot of context for understanding earlier behavior. (However, the description does say \u201coften,\u201d not \u201calways.\u201d Similarly, it says \u201cfrequently\u201d with respect to delayed language development, but we know that the former diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s that has now been rolled together with PDD-NOS and other former diagnoses into the single category of ASD was noted for having no noticeable language delay.) I did have odd play patterns, but only odd in retrospect. They seemed normal to me \u2014 after all, why would I engage in play that *I* found odd. I lined my dolls up a lot. I did name them all, but I couldn\u2019t remember their names so at one point I wrote their names on slips of paper and attached each name to its corresponding doll so I could remember what I had named them. (Naming one\u2019s dolls seemed very important to me because that was always the first question an adult asked when they saw one of my doll\u2019s: \u201cwhat\u2019s her name?\u201d so I was trying very hard to be able to have the right answer. I was very concerned with having the right answer for every question.) After my diagnosis, I spent a lot of time looking back over my childhood, initially with the hope that I could find enough evidence to disprove the autism diagnosis. I didn\u2019t want to be autistic and I fought hard against the diagnosis for a long time before I accepted it. One of the things I hit on was the thought that I had, indeed, been engaging in imaginative play so I couldn\u2019t possible be autistic. After I thought about it for a few more years, I finally understood that what I had thought was imaginative actually wasn\u2019t. My prime example for imaginative play was that I build an \u201cisland home\u201d in my play corner. I built a hut by attaching a sheet to a bookcase and to a toy chest so it angled down like a lean-to. I hauled some baskets in there. My father gave me a beautiful abalone shell that I added to the set. But what was I actually doing? I was making a life-sized diorama. I had read Scott O\u2019Dell\u2019s award-winning book,  The Island of the Blue Dolphin , and was captivated by the story of an island girl who had to survive alone after her village moved to the mainland, accidentally leaving her behind. I reconstructed Karana\u2019s home from items around the house. I tried to emulate as many elements from the story as I could. I would sit in my \u201cwhalebone hut\u201d and think about things that happened in the book. But I never made new adventures for Karana. I never imagined new things. My \u201cimaginative play\u201d was entirely imagined by Mr. O\u2019Dell. My daydreams were the same. I loved the show  Gilligan\u2019s Island  and I would imagine episodes I had watched, inserting myself into the story. Today, there\u2019s a name for a character like that. People who write fanfic (fan fiction: stories set in a pre-existing fictional universe) who include themselves (or a thinly-veiled version of themselves) into stories are said to be creating \u201cMary Sues.\u201d I was the queen of the Mary Sues as a child! People might well have wondered what I was thinking about when I sat, quietly daydreaming. I had many different thoughts, but a common daydream themes were Mary Sues: me on  Gilligan\u2019s Island . Me on  Bewitched . Me on  Lost in Space . I never made new stories \u2014 they were always established episodes I had actually seen. My presence never changed the plot or the outcome. I was simply inserted into a pre-existing story, whole cloth. It took me a long time to understand what \u201cimpaired imagination\u201d meant or to accept that I do actually have a different type of imagination from most people. I bristled at the idea that my imagination could be impaired. I am one of the most creative people I know. I knit, crochet, write, compose music, sew. I follow patterns or tutorials and I create new things. I see ways to rearrange things into new configurations that are different, not merely derivative. I do have a much more difficult time writing fiction than non-fiction (not something shared by my fellow Autistics. I know several Autistics who write terrific fiction.)\u00a0But I really didn\u2019t like thinking of myself as someone \u201clacking imagination\u201d at all. I have since learned that, while I may not be \u201clacking\u201d something (I am whole and complete!) I do have a different sort of imagination than people who have more mainstream neurologies. The breakthrough for me in understanding the differences in my imagination came when I was learning more about alexithymia (which is a label for a cluster of different but related states, all sharing the trait of having difficulty identifying one\u2019s own emotions.) I found an  imagination self-test  when reading about alexithymia and took it. It looks at two types of imagination, spontaneous and constructed, and analyzes whether the test-taker has both or predominantly one or the other. I got an extremely low numerical score, indicating that my type of imagination is almost entirely constructed, not spontaneous. That answered a lot of questions for me . . . but only about me, not about autism in general, because it turned out that many of my fellow Autistics got different scores. I have not yet figured out if my low score and my moderate alexithymia are a correlation \u2014 I haven\u2019t had a chance to compare others\u2019 scores on the imagination test to their levels of alexithymia. When I googled just not to find the test again, I discovered that my friend, Cynthia, wrote  a blog entry about taking the imagination test  on a different web site that gives statistics for tests based on how many people have taken them and whether the takers are Autistics or not. Her thoughts on the test are quite interesting (and I was excited to see that she used to daydream about  Lost in Space , too!) and I recommend taking a look at her blog entry on the topic of autism and imagination and the alexithymia imagination test. I hope no one is disappointed that I explored this paragraph from the DSM-5 solely in relation to my own life experience as an Autistic. I really didn\u2019t have much to say about the paragraph otherwise (and it\u2019s been a tiring couple of days so I may have missed something obvious I could have talked about.) I\u2019d love to see comments and discussions of this paragraph in light of how *you* or *your children* fit or don\u2019t fit into the traits described. When I start writing on one of these snippets from the DSM-5, I\u2019m never sure where it\u2019s going to go. This one went to reminiscing about my own life. I also never can predict where comments and discussions are going to go, so if this entry moves you to talk about something entirely different, please feel free to share that, too! As always, everyone\u2019s comments will be approved (although sometimes there\u2019s a time lag) except for anything that is attacking or abusive. You don\u2019t have to agree with me or with anyone here, but you do have to play nice. Thanks!

Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m still very into this series and very excited to be writing about this topic. Paragraph 2 in the Development and Course section of the commentary in the autism spectrum disorder entry of the DSM-5: The behavioral features of autism spectrum disorder first become evident in early childhood, with some cases presenting a lack of interest in social interaction in the first year of life. Some children with autism spectrum disorder experience developmental plateaus or regression, with a gradual or relatively rapid deterioration in social behaviors or use of language, often during the first 2 years of life. Such losses are rare in other disorders and may be a useful \u201cred flag\u201d for autism spectrum disorder. Much more unusual and warranting more extensive medical investigation are losses of skill beyond social communication (e.g., loss of self-care, toileting, motor skills) or those occurring after the second birthday (see also Rett syndrome in the section \u201cDifferential Diagnosis\u201d for this disorder). I think this paragraph is especially interesting because there has been a lot of debate in the autism community about whether regression actually occurs or whether something else is going on, for example, a developmental delay causing slower progress that only starts getting noticed when a significant number of milestones are missed. I also think some people have a lot invested in the \u201cregression vs. slower development\u201d argument because of how it feeds into the vaccine argument. Regression is often seen as evidence to support the vaccines-cause-autism theory because the typical age of regression and the age of lots of vaccines and boosters tend to coincide, making lots of parents feel that their child was just fine until s/he got the vaccines. But with the DSM-5 declaring that regression is a genuine thing that actually occurs, it weakens the vaccine argument because so many of those children who appeared to be having an abnormal regression when they got their shots turn out to have been having a normal (for autism) regression that just happened to be at the same time as the shots. For a long time, I was undecided as to where I stood on the issue of autistic regression as far as whether it was something that actually occurred or something that appeared to occur because a child was developing slowly and it took a number of months before the divergence of the Autistic child\u2019s development was noticeable in comparison to the non-autistic children\u2019s development trajectory. (I never accepted the vaccine theory, even before Wakefield was discovered to have lied about his data and lost his license to practice medicine as a result of it.) What convinced me that regression is a real thing was getting to know two different Autistic people who have fallen into the category described in the last sentence of this paragraph: regression after age two. Both people I know had significant autistic regression in their teen years (and both were repeatedly accused of being frauds because regression after age two is so rare. So I am glad to see the DSM-5 acknowledging that late regression can, indeed, occur and hope this helps my friends when they are criticized for not being able to do as adults many of the things they could do as pre-teens.) There is scientific evidence of late autistic regression before the DSM-5 and it is probably some of that research that informed the committee that made the decisions for the ASD entry and commentary in the DSM-5. The big one I always come back to is  a 2000 article by Lorna Wing and Amitta Shah in  The British Journal of Psychiatry .  The article is titled \u201cCatatonia in autistic spectrum disorders\u201d and it discusses a phenomenon the authors observed \u2014 a small percentage of Autistics develop increased catatonic behavior and apparent loss of skills around age 10 to 19. Some of those who fit this profile were previously diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, indicating that the change in observed behavior can be quite large in these cases. The two people I know who fit this profile (and fit it uncannily well, I should add) do not like the word \u201cregression\u201d to describe their observable changes. I agree with their reasons for displeasure with the term, but will continue to use it for this blog entry because it is the word used in the DSM-5 and I don\u2019t want to cause confusion by changing terms. But do be aware that many Autistics find it painful to be described\u00a0in those terms. And never assume that an Autistic doesn\u2019t hear what you say around them. There have been cases of Autistics who\u00a0were uncommunicative until they were in their 30s and were accidentally left near a typewriter, at which point they revealed that they could communicate, that they had somehow picked up written language with it never being taught to them, that they had heard and remembered everything that had been said to or about them, and that a lot of\u00a0the assumptions people were making about them were very damaging. So assume that everything you say is heard and understood and try to remember that some ways of referring to people hurt. Calling an Autistic\u2019s change in observed behavior \u201cregression\u201d can make a person feel like their growth is not recognized, only their deficits. And it can carry undertones of a message that the individual is not what they should be or what was desired from them. These may seem small nits to pick, but if you are the one who is being misinterpreted and talked about right in front of you all the time,\u00a0issues like the words\u00a0and concepts that are being used to describe you are huge. At any rate, back to the idea of regression in later life. Because I know two people who have experienced this, I was already well-placed to accept what the DSM-5 has to say about the existence of regression. If I know people who \u201cregressed\u201d in their late teens, why shouldn\u2019t I believe that\u00a0some autistics \u201cregress\u201d at age two or so? The development of an Autistic person is not a linear progression and our severity levels, as mentioned earlier, can be quite fluid. So I fully accept this paragraph of the Development and Course section of the ASD discussion in the DSM-5 and I am pleased to see a mention of later regression. While the discussion doesn\u2019t make it clear that this later regression can\u00a0occur in one\u2019s teens (or in one\u2019s thirties or forties, I should add. I have seen Autistics lose skills temporarily in the wake of a life tragedy in their middle age years) It does explain that this loss of skills can happen after age two and that\u2019s going to be very beneficial for the many Autistics who don\u2019t precisely fit the standard narrative. To take this from a theoretical level to a personal level, I have lost skills at different times in my life. Regular readers will already know that I, like many other Autistics I know, sometimes lose the skill of speech (although I am still able to write or use ASL during times when I am unvoiced.) That is my most frequent encounter with shifting skill levels, but I do have times when I stim more and times when I stim less. I have times when I forget how to cook or even forget how to stay on task enough to eat. I frequently forget how to get from point A to point B (a state worsened by my topographical agnosia in which familiar places can look foreign, especially if I am approaching them from a direction I usually don\u2019t.) I have times when my self-regulation of emotion skills drop out. I have times when it is practically impossible for me to understand human speech and other times when I have problems with understanding spoken language but the problems are small. I also, though I do not have and have never experienced catatonia as described in the Wing and Shah article, have days where my sense of balance is completely obliterated and I fall down several times in the course of living a normal day (and other days when my balance is strong enough to do yoga asanas.) My skills are uneven and they can come and go and I\u2019m not always aware of the triggers. I\u2019d like to see a discussion in the comments of \u201cregression\u201d, both temporary and apparently permanent. Did your kid \u201cregress\u201d? What age and how? (And I\u2019m sorry for any pain you feel from watching your child experience those changes. As much as we don\u2019t like being described as \u201cregressing\u201d I am aware of how stressful and painful it can be for a parent to watch us go through these things and similar things Autistics regularly experience.) Have you \u201cregressed\u201d in your autism? How do you feel about it? I think this is an important topic and I\u2019m glad to see the DSM-5 team opening the discussion of autistic regression. Thank you for reading and I\u2019m looking forward to any discussions that crop up in the comments for this entry.

I know I\u2019m skipping around a little bit, but I want to go through the commentary section about Development and Course of Autism next. This section has seven paragraphs and I\u2019m going to take them one by one. So here\u2019s the first paragraph in that section: The age and pattern of onset also should be noted for autism spectrum disorder. Symptoms are typically recognized during the second year of life (12-24 months of age) but may be seen earlier than 12 months if developmental delays are severe, or noted later than 24 months if symptoms are more subtle. The pattern of onset description might include information about early developmental delays or any losses of social or language skills. In cases where skills have been lost, parents of caregivers may give a history of a gradual or relatively rapid deterioration in social behaviors or language skills. Typically, this would occur between 12 and 24 months of age\u00a0 and is distinguished from the rare instances of developmental regression occurring after at least 2 years of normal development (previously described as childhood disintegrative disorder). First sentence: yes, age and pattern of onset are important. Age is crucial, since autism is a congenital condition (in other words, something you\u2019re born with.) As we talked about here before, though, autism often goes unnoticed in earliest life. The commentary attributes that to the severity or subtlety of the delays and symptoms, but for those from my generation there is another element to that. My symptoms were quite noticeable. I spent most of my childhood in therapy. It was quite obvious that *something* was going on. If I had been born 40 years later than I was, I surely would have been diagnosed Autistic in childhood. But many in my age group were not recognized, even when our symptoms were not subtle, because there wasn\u2019t as much knowledge back in the Sixties and Seventies as there is today. Yes, obviously some people got diagnosed properly back then \u2014 for example, Temple Grandin or Daryl Hannah. But most of us were just confusing to our parents and the professionals who examined us. This is because the understanding of how autism manifests was more limited back then, not the full spectrum we have today. For some examples, see this  British article from 1966  or this  53 minute documentary from 2003 about parenting a child with autism in the 1950s and 1960s . (The documentary needs a trigger warning to Autistics\u00a0for talk of a child being \u201cgone\u201d or \u201clost\u201d after signs of regressive autism appeared. And also a trigger warning to parents of Autistics for accusations of parents as causing their child\u2019s autism.) Half-way through the 2003 documentary, we meet a clearly Autistic adult whose mother says that the doctors refused to diagnose him back then because the family was African-American and not upper-middle class and highly educated. Fascinating. The way you see autism depicted in the 1960s will be very familiar to you but you will also recognize that it\u2019s only one aspect of what we understand autism to be today. The documentary will also show why people of my generation did sometimes get diagnosed but their parents rejected the diagnosis \u2014 since autism was blamed on the parents back then, particularly a \u201cRefrigerator Mother.\u201d So, often, a person my age who was struggling and was diagnosed with autism ended up removed and brought to a new therapist in a sort of \u201cdiagnosis shopping\u201d enacted by parents who couldn\u2019t bear to accept the blame that was so unfairly being leveled at them for their child\u2019s difficulties. Something else interesting to notice with the Refrigerator Mother documentary: the children were all very similar but the adults they grew up to be are so different. I find that fascinating and I think it indicates how much more study we need into autism across the life span so that we can understand outcomes better and maybe even eventually predict outcomes. The rest of the paragraph: I have talked to parents who claimed they knew \u201csomething was up\u201d with their child (who later turned out to be Autistic) from the day the child was born. But most children aren\u2019t spotted until they are a couple of years old. Some slip through the cracks a little longer but almost all of us displayed clear symptoms by the time we were school age. One last thing to note: the commentary says that it is rare to appear to regress after age two, but it does happen. I have noticed that the loss of skills, ability to cope, and functioning can happen at any age. All those who regress show signs of autism from the beginning, but some people go through a so-called regression as children, some at puberty, some in mid-life, often due to the stress and burn-out associated with a life-time of struggling to \u201cfake it\u201d as much as possible. The goal of normalization seems great on first glance \u2014 the goal of making an Autistic person \u201cindistinguishable from their peers.\u201d But what more and more people are starting to realize is that normalization comes at a price. It takes a great deal of effort to keep up\u00a0a fa\u00e7ade of normality and it wears on a person over time. I have lost some of the function and coping I used to have in my twenties because of the exhaustion and burn-out of trying to \u201chold it together\u201d all these years. I have struggled to try to \u201clook normal\u201d in public for so long now that it\u2019s a habit. I work to suppress my more unusual behaviors and only let loose when I am alone and can rock, pace, tic, spin, and otherwise stim as much as my body needs me to. Trying to hold it together is hard work and I have depleted myself over the years. I find it very difficult to go out in public at all and hard to stay out in public for long stretches of times. To some, I might appear to have become slightly \u201cmore autistic\u201d than I used to be and it might even be seen as a regression, but the skill, coping, and energy losses are solely due to the great toll that attempts at appearing normal have on me. I think many of the cases of what is called \u201clate regression\u201d are just as likely to be cases of \u201cburn out\u201d where a person had tried to function like everyone else and finally couldn\u2019t hold the act any longer. So there\u2019s the first paragraph of the development section! I\u2019ll be back next time with a discussion surrounding the contents of the second paragraph of that section. There is still a lot of DSM-5 material to work through, so I think this blog series will be going on for quite a while. With that in mind, I hope you all are still enjoying it! I know I\u2019m enjoying thinking and writing about these things. Thank you for reading and thank you in advance for any comments.

I\u2019m an open book about this book I\u2019ve opened. [image description: photo of the pages of an opened book] Autism and the DSM 5:\u00a0Diagnostic Criteria: \nSection\u00a0E and Severity Levels originally published September 21, 2013 Index \n Part 1: Losing Your Diagnosis?\u00a0 \n Part 2: Diagnostic Criteria: Section A \n Part 3: Diagnostic Criteria: Section B \n Part 4: Diagnostic Criteria: Section C \n Part 5: Diagnostic Criteria: Section D \nPart 6: (you are here) \n Part 7: Development and Course: Part 1 \n Part 8: Development and Course: Part 2 \n Part 9: Development and Course: Part 3 \n Part 10: Development and Course: Part 4 I\u2019m combining Section E and Severity levels in one post because I don\u2019t have a lot to say about Section E: E. These symptoms are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level. The very few things I want to say: a. intellectual disability and autism are two separate things (though often found together.) I think everyone reading this blog already knows that but I also think almost everybody reading this blog has encountered someone at some point who didn\u2019t know that and I suspect many of us have frustrating stories. It can be difficult when, like me,\u00a0one doesn\u2019t\u00a0want to come across as stigmatizing toward intellectual disability (in fact, I feel strong solidarity with those with intellectual disability) but\u00a0one wants to communicate that autism is not the same thing as intellectual disability. I have the same issue with mental illness \u2014 autism is not a mental illness, but I don\u2019t want to add to the stigmatization of mental illness. I\u2019ve stopped correcting people who call autism a mental illness because I realized I really can\u2019t say what makes it different: most mental illnesses are partially or wholly\u00a0neurological (as is autism), mental illnesses are stigmatized (as is autism), mental illnesses lead people to behave in ways that others don\u2019t understand or are afraid of (as does autism). I no longer see any point in correcting someone who calls autism a mental illness. b. a repeat of what\u2019s already been said: autism is not a static, monolithic thing. If you are looking at a child, you expect autism to look different than if you are looking at an adult. Similarly, if you are looking at someone with an intellectual disability, you expect autism to look different than if you are looking at someone who scores very high on I.Q. tests. Something I noticed when I watched Sean Penn\u2019s performance in the movie  I Am Sam  was how much an intellectual disability can resemble autism. I figured, \u201cwell, it\u2019s just a movie. Not all of Hoffman\u2019s models for  Rain   Man  were Autistic so maybe Penn modeled after some Autistic people when preparing for the role,\u201d But a little bit of research revealed that there is a bit of \u201cobservational cross-over\u201d in real life. So one thing Section E is saying is to watch for that cross-over and be prepared to have to decide if the developmental delay is expected or unusual. (Intellectual Disability and Autism are so closely related that they appear in the same section of the DSM and they do often walk hand in hand. This brings up a lot of\u00a0thoughts about the way autism is portrayed, but I\u2019ll save those for another time because they\u2019re a little\u00a0more off-topic than I prefer to get in a blog essay, rambling though I tend to be.) On to Severity\u00a0Levels. The severity specifiers (see Table 2) may be used to describe succinctly the current symptomatology (which might fall below level 1), with the recognition that the severity may vary by context and fluctuate over time. Severity of social communication difficulties and restricted, repetitive behaviors should be separately rated. The descriptive severity categories should not be used to determine eligibility for and provision of services; these can only be developed at an individual level and through discussion of personal priorities and targets. Look at that!! Did you see what they did there? \u201cseverity may vary by context and fluctuate over time.\u201d This is terrific! They are acknowledging (they acknowledge this multiple times and in different ways throughout the overall DSM-5 entry) that severity level is not a static thing! Hurrah! There is a conversation currently going on in the comments sections of these entries that is talking about this issue. Check it out. A woman in her mid-thirties is having problems right now and is seeking help and concerned that her potential autism diagnosis will be rejected because she was functioning at a higher level when she was a child and being very supported by the adults in her life. Now that she is going it on her own, she finds herself floundering. That is a change in context (and time) that has affected her severity level. And did you notice that bit about how the symptomatology might fall below level 1? While clinically significant impairment is required for an autism diagnosis, it is recognized that an Autistic\u00a0person might not always be impaired enough to require supports. Falling below level 1 means sometimes not needing supports at all. It is recognized that someone might be severity level 2 in some things, severity level 1 in others, and not needing supports at all in yet another set of life skills. This is one of the reasons so many Autistics shy away from \u201cfunction labels.\u201d For example, I would be called a high-functioning autistic (in fact, I\u2019ve seen that exact phrase in some of my medical records) but my functioning is fluid and there are times when I am not high-functioning at all. Calling me high-functioning sets up expectations that might block me from meeting some of my needs, for example my need for alternate forms of communication when I am in the hospital and my ability to speak has dropped out due to stress and illness. But I don\u2019t mind as much being described as \u201ccurrently functioning at severity level 1\u201d because there is the implication that I might not always function at that level. It communicates something (but not everything) about my current needs but does not cement me in that one place where it is never recognized that I sometimes have other needs. And on top of that, the DSM-5 recognizes that severity level is just a rough outline that doesn\u2019t tell you very much about an individual and so they remind professionals who are reading the entry that they cannot use severity level to determine services! That is also huge! Yes, it costs more and takes more time to approach services on a case-by-case, individualized basis but that\u2019s the thing about autism: every one of us is so different from every other one of us that there really is no other way to ensure appropriate services are provided. We have to be personally fit into the programs and services we need! So, I am really happy about that. I will leave you with the actual table of severity levels. They come in two flavors: social communication, and restricted repetitive behaviors. That\u2019s also nice: it\u2019s recognized that someone can be at different severity levels in those two things simultaneously. DSM-5 really does represent an improvement in how we, as a society, as talking about autism. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to specifically discuss what\u2019s in the severity table unless others make thought-provoking comments that really make me want to dive in there. It\u2019s mostly an attempt to quantify the factors that were already discussed in Sections A and B. So with Table 2, I bid you adieu for the day and will be back tomorrow with more discussion of the DSM-5. TABLE 2: Severity levels for autism spectrum disorder ============================================= Severity Level:  Level 3 \u201cRequiring very substantial support\u201d Social Communication:  Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills cause severe impairments in functioning, very limited initiation of social interactions, and minimal response to social overtures from others. For example, a person with few words of intelligible speech who rarely initiates interaction and,\u00a0 when he or she does, makes unusual approaches to meet needs only and responds to only very direct social approaches. Restricted, Repetitive Behaviors:  Inflexibility of behavior, extreme difficulty coping with change, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors markedly interfere with functioning in all spheres. Great distress/difficulty changing focus or action. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 Severity Level:  Level\u00a02 \u201cRequiring\u00a0substantial support\u201d Social Communication:  Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills; social impairments apparent even with supports in place; limited initiation of social interactions; and reduced or abnormal responses to social overtures from others. For example, a person who speaks simple sentences, whose interaction is limited to narrow special interests, and who has markedly odd nonverbal communication. Restricted, Repetitive Behaviors:  Inflexibility of behavior, difficulty coping with change, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors appear frequently enough to be obvious to the casual observer and interfere with functioning in a variety of contexts. Distress and/or difficulty changing focus or action. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 Severity Level:  Level\u00a01 \u201cRequiring\u00a0support\u201d Social Communication:  Without supports in place, deficits in social communication cause noticeable impairments. Difficulty initiating social interactions, and clear examples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to social overtures of others. May appear to have decreased interest in social interactions. For example, a person who is able to speak in full sentences and engages in communication but whose to-and-fro conversation with others fails, and whose attempts to make friends are odd and typically unsuccessful. Restricted, Repetitive Behaviors:  Inflexibility of behavior causes significant interference with functioning in one or more contexts. Difficulty switching between activities. Problems of organization and planning hamper independence.

I\u2019m an open book about this book I\u2019ve opened. [image description: photo of the pages of an opened book] Autism and the DSM 5:\u00a0Diagnostic Criteria: Section C originally published September 19, 2013 Index \n Part 1: Losing Your Diagnosis?\u00a0 \n Part 2: Diagnostic Criteria: Section A \n Part 3: Diagnostic Criteria: Section B \nPart 4: (you are here) \n Part 5: Diagnostic Criteria: Section D \n Part 6:\u00a0Diagnostic Criteria: Section E and Severity Levels \n Part 7: Development and Course: Part 1 \n Part 8: Development and Course: Part 2 \n Part 9: Development and Course: Part 3 \n Part 10: Development and Course: Part 4 Good morning! I\u2019m going to look at the section C of the diagnostic criteria today. I originally thought I was going to put C, D, and E all together but when I realized I\u2019d already written a thousand words about C, I decided to take them one at a time after all. After that, we\u2019ll\u00a0 move on to the table of severity levels and the discussion of severity levels, then on to the rest of the discussion section in the DSM-5. This is from page 50 of the DSM-5, in the section titled \u201cAutism Spectrum Disorder: Diagnostic Criteria 299.00 (F84.0)\u201d C. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life.) Let\u2019s unpack\u00a0this. This one is HUGE! The DSM is acknowledging a couple of things here. They are acknowledging that a child may seem \u201cjust fine\u201d to their parents (although there are also plenty of parents of Autistic children who say they knew something was different almost from the day of birth!) until they go to school and start interacting with their peers and having more demands placed on them. I was one of those children. There were definite signs before school. For example, I learned to read somewhere around 2 or 3 years of age (hyperlexia) and began reading obsessively afterwards (and for the rest of my life. I actually have a panic attack if I think I will be stuck with nothing to read, so I have a nice stack of books waiting for me to read them because it gives me a sense of security and safety to know I have more reading material available than I could possibly read my way through before I buy more books. The internet also helps me feel safer about not running out of reading material. (I am straying off topic a bit, but one of the worst things adults used to do to me as a child was take away my books to try to force me to go play with other children.) I also had issues with spoken\u00a0language dropping in and out and I remember my mother many times telling me to use my words, saying that she knew I knew how to speak and she wasn\u2019t going to give me the food or drink\u00a0I was pointing to until I said with words that I wanted it. Very frustrating. But despite those \u201cquirks\u201d and other similar ones, and despite the concerns they raised in my parents (my father once told me it was kind of creepy to see a child so tiny, and barely able to\u00a0speak her own words,\u00a0yet able to read the newspaper and encyclopedia out loud, rapidly and perfectly) I was considered a normal-but-bright child until I went to school and the really noticeable behaviors began: hiding under the table all day and biting anyone who tried to coax me out, for example. Or coming out for art time but refusing to paint or color with anything other than black. So it was at age 5 when I first began to visit a psychiatrist in an attempt to understand what was wrong with me. In my own case, the autism was masked by my brother\u2019s leukemia \u2014 he was diagnosed when I was 3 and died a month and a half before I turned 7. And there wasn\u2019t as much understanding of autism back in 1972 when I first began visiting professionals, so for most of my childhood all my autistic traits were assumed to be signs of grief. The other thing that is pretty huge about section C is that it points out that we develop over the years, that autism manifests differently along the lifespan, and that many adults have learned how to fit in better. I\u2019ve had people say I can\u2019t be Autistic because I understand and use colloquialisms and sayings like \u201cdon\u2019t count your chickens before they have hatched\u201d without getting puzzled about what chickens have to do with the plans I am making about my future. I know what that saying (and many others) mean because at some point, in my childhood, I *was* confused about what chickens had to do with things or why someone said I shouldn\u2019t put all my eggs in one basket when I didn\u2019t have a basket or any eggs. I asked \u2014 or someone saw my confusion and explained \u2014 and I learned. I filed it away and when I began writing, I found I enjoyed using these strange sayings and other types of slang and casual language because I find them colorful and expressive. I \u201ccracked the code.\u201d But I still get tripped up by these things! Last year I was exposed to the saying \u201clet a thousand flowers bloom\u201d and I had to ask for it to be explained to me. It didn\u2019t make sense and I still find the phrase confusing, but I know what it means now.\u00a0Knowing what these abstract sayings mean\u00a0doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not Autistic any more \u2014 it means I have the ability to learn and change and grow. It is so terrific that criterion C mentions that trait of Autistic people! We are not static! We have a developmental delay but not a developmental halt! We can learn and change and grow and some of us may even change so much that we don\u2019t \u201clook Autistic\u201d any more, at least to some people, some of the time. On a good day, I can go to the grocery, buy some food, pay for it, and leave, and no one realizes that they were just shopping next to an Autistic woman. On a difficult day, there is no way I can hide my differences and I see the stares and hear people asking each other questions about me. On a really bad day, I don\u2019t even go to the grocery, even if I\u2019m out of food. But the take-away from C is that you should not try to judge whether someone is Autistic or not by just looking at them without knowing them deeply. You might be seeing them on a really easy day or in a really easy situation. You might be looking at a child in a setting that does not offer too many demands\u00a0or too much challenge. You might be looking at an adult who has learned ways to be more invisible and look more like everyone else. Or you might be looking at someone who is expending a huge amount of effort. The French writer, Camus, once wrote: \u201cNobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.\u201d He could easily have been talking about a lot of Autistic people! That \u201cgood day\u201d trip to the grocery store I described? It is absolutely exhausting to me. Yes, I go in and buy 5 or 10 items and make smiles and chit-chat and leave a good impression behind me. Then I go home and collapse with the exhaustion of the effort. So I have to give another huge check mark to the DSM-5 \u2014 two check marks, actually \u2014 for criterion C. This section of the diagnostic criteria recognizes that we change and develop and that we can look different at different times in our lives or in different situations. I have some friends who say they believe I am Autistic but they are confused because they don\u2019t see it. That is because they have only seen me within my \u201csafety zone\u201d and on \u201csocial days.\u201d The moment they see me outside of the nice, shiny bubble I work hard to keep around myself and my life, they immediately understand. My partner has seen me far, far outside that bubble and says there is no doubt in his mind that I am, indeed, Autistic. (And part of why I love him so much is that not only does he understand the hard things about autism, but he sees the beautiful things about it, too, and says that he wishes he could take away the struggle but he doesn\u2019t wish he could take away the autism because too many of the things he loves about me are autistic traits.) So, just as much as I want you to remember not to judge the family you might see with the exhausted mother desperately trying to run interference on the screaming, crying child who seems \u201ctoo old to behave that way.\u201d I also want you to remember not to judge the person who has identified themselves or their child as being on the autism spectrum yet that Autistic person seems \u201ctoo normal to really be Autistic.\u201d If you only see one slice of an Autistic life, you don\u2019t have enough context to make any sort of judgments, good or bad, about that life or the family, friends, and environment that person lives their life among. I will be touching on these issues a lot more tomorrow when we look at section D. There is a lot to say about that criterion, too! Until then, may you have a lovely day and may you always be kind to and appreciate those you love. And may you always be sure to put yourself on that list of loved ones you must remember to treat well!

I\u2019m enjoying these morning posts. I\u2019m also putting together a book of my essays this week. It will have my two most popular posts from this blog and all the rest of the essays will be new, never before seen, essays. I\u2019m writing about food and eating habits, body image and body issues, what autism means to me, what is \u201cnormal\u201d and who is \u201callowed\u201d to be not normal, how I relate to objects, people, and animals, normalization, independent living, and more. I\u2019ll post here when it\u2019s ready. It will be for sale on Amazon as a Kindle book (you can get free Kindle readers for just about any device so you don\u2019t need an actual Kindle to read it.) and I hope some of you will be interested in getting and reading it. In the meantime, back to the DSM-5 series! I am really loving going through this, piece by piece. Today\u2019s section is Section D from page 50: D. Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning. Wow, one little sentence. Some of the other sections were huge and section D is just one sentence. Basically, it\u2019s saying that it\u2019s okay if all the visible symptoms and traits are in your childhood and you have compensated for them now, but you still have to have significant impairment in at least one important area of your life. This is a rough one to write about because it starts to get into some of the politics of the Autistic community. (The Autistic community is the community of people who are actually Autistic themselves. The Autism community is the larger community that also includes parents and caregivers, professionals, researchers, etc.) Some of the things this sentence touches on will be addressed later in this DSM-5 series because the section on severity brings those topics up again. Some are not explicitly mentioned in the DSM-5. One thing this immediately brings to mind for me are the ongoing discussions among Autistics about the concept of \u201cfunctioning levels.\u201d Many prominent Autistic writers have pointed out that if a person is labeled as \u201chigh functioning,\u201d often their struggles get ignored and they don\u2019t get as much help as they need. But if a person is labeled as \u201clow functioning,\u201d the expectations others have for them are often equally low and their skills and accomplishments are either ignored or treated as a sort of freakish \u201csplinter skill.\u201d I finally got some of the help I need, but before I got my aide, I often complained that functioning levels are deadly because I kept getting shuffled from one agency to another and being told by one\u00a0organization that I was too high functioning to qualify for their assistance but told by another that I was too low functioning to qualify. So things like functioning levels and severity levels (and mental age) are really sticky things in the Autistic community and many of us feel that these things dehumanize Autistics. At the same time, when roughly 1% of the population is Autistic, there has to be an efficient way to sort through us to make sure that people are getting assistance at an appropriate level, so severity levels and functioning assessments are quite necessary. I think the DSM-5 does a good job with this, but that\u2019s a subject for a couple of days from now when I post the severity tables and talk about them. Another issue people will likely have with this sentence is the idea that if you have no \u201cclinically significant\u201d difficulties, you\u2019re not Autistic (and a related debate centers around what makes a difficulty \u201cclinically significant.\u201d For example, losing your keys is not clinically significant. Losing your keys several times a day, every day is quite possibly clinically significant. Where is the break point between those two?) One thing that the layperson can get from this criterion is, again, to withhold judgment. I confess, I have sometimes looked at a fellow Autistic who has held the same job for 30 years and has a circle of friends they get together with regularly, who feeds themselves and keeps their house clean, and I wonder, \u201chow are they Autistic?\u201d This really is a confession, because this is the first time that I have ever publically admitted that I have these thoughts. That is because they are thoughts I am not proud of \u2014 it is judgmental and inappropriate. But I have also noticed that if I get to know that person better, I often learn more details about their life that aren\u2019t so clear on the surface. Like maybe\u00a0I only thought they were feeding themselves well and they actually often forget to eat or have too much exhaustion or inertia to eat for days at a time and are\u00a0genuinely but invisibly\u00a0malnourished while they go about doing their job and keeping their home in order and writing very moving things. Or maybe they\u2019ve had the job for 30 years but they are seriously held back in their career because they don\u2019t have any friends at work and don\u2019t know how to play the office politics so they have been trapped beneath a glass ceiling all those years and are deeply frustrated to still be doing grunt work so far below what they are capable of because they aren\u2019t given the chance to show what they can really do. In one case, I was quietly judging someone else\u2019s life only to later learn that they use AAC to communicate rather than speaking! That was an eye-opener! I really can\u2019t judge how difficult or easy someone\u2019s life is, where their challenges lie, or if their autism is \u201cclinically significant\u201d in a casual meeting and certainly not over the internet! But this brings up something else: if a person actually does develop enough coping mechanisms and learns well enough how to fit in so as to actually live up to that Holy Grail of \u201cindistinguishable from peers,\u201d are they still Autistic? I see claims that someone \u201coutgrew\u201d their autism or that their autism was \u201ccured\u201d or \u201cin remission\u201d and I wonder how a condition that is marked by both structural and functional brain differences that are congential \u2014 that is, present from birth \u2014 could ever be said to be \u201cno longer\u00a0Autistic\u201d if they still have the same brain. And there is the question\u00a0of whether the person is actually \u201ccured\u201d or has just learned to layer the right behaviors over top of a brain that is still very Autistic. I can understand, with the stigma that comes along with autism, why someone might want to\u00a0distance themselves or their child from the diagnosis if they have learned how to cover up the autism or their brain has developed to such a degree that they can pass for not-autistic. But I don\u2019t really think those cases are examples of \u201ccures\u201d because what makes a person Autistic (to me) is that they were born with an Autistic brain. So I\u00a0think the more correct way to refer to people who have developed those coping and masking skills so well is \u201cno longer clinically diagnosable.\u201d And that\u2019s basically what criterion D is saying: you can be quirky, you can have some measure of all these traits or have had them in\u00a0childhood, but if you aren\u2019t having significant difficulty with work or socializing or self-care or any other \u00a0important area of life, we can\u2019t diagnose you with autism. You might have social anxiety instead. Or you might just be eccentric. Or maybe you actually are Autistic but you are not currently diagnosable. It is interesting to me that one is required to have significant impairment in order to have the diagnosis. I\u2019m still kind of sensing out how I feel about that. For example, is Temple Grandin still Autistic? She works as a professor of animal agriculture and also as a speaker and writer about autism. She has pretty strong job security and seems to be doing great, career-wise. I have never heard her mention troubles with keeping her house clean or feeding herself. She seems to have friends and colleagues she enjoys and has expressed a disinterest in romantic relationships. She found the medication\u00a0and lifestyle solutions that addressed her anxiety. She seems to function quite well with no real impairments, right? But I have met Temple and it was very clear to me that she is very Autistic. It is incredibly obvious when you speak with her.\u00a0She has worked very hard to get where she is in life and\u00a0she has built a life that supports her needs, so she is not noticeably impaired in function.\u00a0And, according to criterion D, that might mean she is not\u00a0clinically diagnosable as\u00a0Autistic. But,\u00a0come on. She *is* Autistic. Who\u2019s going to argue that she isn\u2019t? So what does section D mean in a real world sense? I think it is\u00a0 more of a signpost than a hard rule. It reminds the clinician that one shouldn\u2019t go around diagnosing\u00a0people who are doing just fine. Diagnoses are not political statements \u2014 they are tools to help others recognize a person\u2019s particular needs. I have an aide because I have a diagnosis. Without the diagnosis, there was no \u201cproof\u201d that I wasn\u2019t just being lazy and hoping someone else would do things for me. I have a genuine impairment that requires assistance. But if someone is\u00a0\u201cfunctioning\u201d but only because they are barely, desperately clinging on by their fingernails, they really aren\u2019t functioning and they really need some assistance.\u00a0I would put forth the idea that Temple Grandin functions so well now *because* she was diagnosed as a child and got the help she needed and was able to earn enough money as an adult to build a comfortable world around herself that\u00a0suits her needs. She doesn\u2019t need a\u00a0diagnosis now because she has built her world to fit her. She has accommodated herself. But not needing a diagnosis is not the same thing as not being Autistic. And maybe that\u2019s the take-away here: don\u2019t judge someone else\u2019s life from a distance and don\u2019t assume that because they seem to be doing really well as an adult they aren\u2019t\u00a0Autistic and didn\u2019t have\u00a0lots of\u00a0extra needs as a child . . . or wouldn\u2019t\u00a0need lots of extra help if something disrupted the world they have built around them. An Autistic\u00a0who really seems to have their life together could be one of the worst hit if a natural disaster occurred because their carefully constructed world got disrupted. Sure, everyone hit by that disaster would be suffering, but the Autistic person who looked \u201ccured\u201d might end up falling farther and suffering worst because they didn\u2019t just lose all their possessions and home like everyone around them but also all the supports and accommodations they had built into their life that were masking their autism. Diagnosing\u00a0autism is tricky stuff and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t question other people\u2019s diagnoses. If someone tells me they are Autistic, that\u2019s good enough\u00a0for me. I don\u2019t need to \u201cfact check\u201d to see if they really are Autistic\u00a0or not. That would be like asking someone to prove they are gay! That would be ridiculous to me. Someone tells me their identity is one that mainstream society often stigmatizes and I\u2019m going to question that identity? No way. So that\u2019s it for\u00a0Section D.\u00a0We\u2019ll revisit some of this in severity levels but my next post will be the last\u00a0lettered section in the diagnostic criteria, Section E. Have a great day! I\u2019m going to go work on that essay book now. I hope your Friday is happy and productive and I hope you\u00a0are looking forward to a wonderful weekend.

I\u2019m an open book about this book I\u2019ve opened. [image description: photo of the pages of an opened book] Autism and the DSM 5:\u00a0Diagnostic Criteria: Section B originally published September 18, 2013 Index \n Part 1: Losing Your Diagnosis?\u00a0 \n Part 2: Diagnostic Criteria: Section A \nPart 3: (you are here) \n Part 4: Diagnostic Criteria: Section C \n Part 5: Diagnostic Criteria: Section D \n Part 6:\u00a0Diagnostic Criteria: Section E and Severity Levels \n Part 7: Development and Course: Part 1 \n Part 8: Development and Course: Part 2 \n Part 9: Development and Course: Part 3 \n Part 10: Development and Course: Part 4 Today I\u2019m looking at section B of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism. And I am awkwardly typing around a cat who decided this was the best time ever to conquer my lap. B. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text): \n 1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g. simple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases). \n 2. Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat same food every day). \n 3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interests). \n 4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement). \n Specify current severity:  Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (see Table 2). \u00a0 Again, some of the things I pointed out yesterday \u2013 the very helpful illustrative descriptions of types of behaviors and traits that fit into these categories, and a broad range of affectedness listed. Also the \u201ccurrently or by history\u201d phrase that is so helpful for someone who is having a hard time now and needs a diagnosis to help them but is not currently\u00a0manifesting all the symptoms required for diagnosis (but manifested sufficient for diagnosis in the past.) Section B is the only section in the diagnostic criteria that is not all-or-nothing. An individual only needs two of these traits for diagnosis. So instead of the thousands of different permutations Alyssa found in DSM-IV, there are only 6 permutations in the diagnostic criteria of DSM-5 (4 items combine in 6 unique pairs: 1&2, 1&3, 1&4, 2&3, 2&4, 3&4.) The other big thing I want to note with this section before I go on with the rest of my day is number 4: \u201cHyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement).\u201d I am so happy to see that in the official criteria! Everybody who knows an Autistic person and every person who is Autistic knows . . . KNOWS . . . that there is \u201cthis sensory stuff\u201d that goes along with autism. There has been a lot of debate and discussion over whether they are additional co-morbids or part of autism itself. And it\u2019s been confusing because our \u201csensory stuff\u201d is so different from person to person. I have hyperacusis \u2013 high pitched sounds make me dizzy, fall over, nauseated, etc. But I have no problem with *loud* sounds \u2014 in fact, I am a drummer. Other Autistics have a hard time with *any* loud sound. I know a married couple and she has hypersensitivity to sound and he has hyposensitivity to sound. So he has a deep need for sound stimulation and puts on loud music and she is assaulted by it because she needs lots of quiet. It\u2019s hard on them. But they\u2019re both\u00a0Autistic and know that about themselves so they work out ways to get both their needs met. I am so happy to see hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity listed\u00a0in the diagnostic criteria. The way\u00a0section B is worded,\u00a0the authors acknowledge that not *every* Autistic person deals with sensory issues. But it also accepts that it\u2019s a huge issue for a large number of us. Thank you, DSM-5 committee. It\u2019s about time! I don\u2019t have anything more to say today. I may combine C, D, and E in one post because they\u2019re so short. Then we\u2019ll move on to the severity table and the DSM-5 discussion of severity levels (which is SO\u00a0AWESOME! I am having a hard time waiting to get to that part!) and then move into some of the other things in the discussion section of the DSM-5 entry on autism. But now it\u2019s time for me to have some breakfast and run some errands so I will be back tomorrow with another DSM-5\u00a0post. Have a great day and be nice to your Autistic (especially if your Autistic is YOU!)

I\u2019m an open book about this book I\u2019ve opened. [image description: photo of the pages of an opened book] Autism and the DSM 5:\u00a0Diagnostic Criteria: Section A originally published September 17, 2013 Index \n Part 1: Losing Your Diagnosis?\u00a0 \nPart 2: (you are here) \n Part 3: Diagnostic Criteria: Section B \n Part 4: Diagnostic Criteria: Section C \n Part 5: Diagnostic Criteria: Section D \n Part 6:\u00a0Diagnostic Criteria: Section E and Severity Levels \n Part 7: Development and Course: Part 1 \n Part 8: Development and Course: Part 2 \n Part 9: Development and Course: Part 3 \n Part 10: Development and Course: Part 4 So, there are a lot of things I am almost bursting to talk about in the DSM-5, but I\u2019m going to set them aside for later posts because I\u2019m guessing that the number one thing people want to know is, \u201cwhat are the new diagnostic criteria?\u201d I gave a taste of that yesterday when I quoted the note that says that *EVERYONE* who has a DSM-IV diagnosis is grandfathered. You all get to keep your diagnoses. But what are they using for people being newly evaluated? If you are familiar with the DSM-IV criteria, you remember they have a sort of buffet going on: chose this many items from list A, this many items from list B, and so on. The new criteria have one \u201ctwo or more items from this list\u201d section, but most of it is absolute \u2014 you have it or you don\u2019t. So where the DSM-IV criteria allow for there to be 3129 different permutations of diagnostic traits that result in an autism spectrum diagnosis (thank you,  Alyssa , for doing that math!) The DSM-5 has significantly cut down on the \u201cwiggle room.\u201d Of course that has people worried! Because autism is a pretty broad spectrum and there are some very diverse ways of manifesting it. I look at my Autistic self and compare it to: my Autistic friends; famous Autistics like Temple Grandin, \u00a0Lianne Holliday-Wiley, Rudy Simone, Wendy Lawson, Jerry Newport, etc.; Autistic children of friends; etc. and I see a pretty wide range of difference. How can we all fit into one narrow set of criteria? Well, let\u2019s look at that. There are five main sections (A, B, C, D, and E) and I\u2019m going to spend today and the next four days looking at them, one at a time. So, let\u2019s see what section A (on page 50 of the DSM-5) says: A. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text): \n 1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions. \n 2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication. \n 3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest in peers. \n Specify current severity: \n Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (see Table 2). (Don\u2019t worry: we\u2019ll get to severity level and Table 2 in a future post.) Okay, see what they did there? They didn\u2019t give the pick-and-choose options we\u2019ve grown used to seeing but they gave illustrative examples of the *range* of things that fit that criteria. That does two things: first, it helps people to get a better grasp of what they mean when they say, for example, \u201cdeficits in social-emotional reciprocity\u201d; and, second it shows that a person can be diagnosable whether they are completely sitting in the corner, staring at the wall, not responding when you call their name or whether they are approaching you and engaging with you but doing it by presenting sort of a \u201cwall of words\u201d where they are \u201cmonologuing\u201d about something really important to them but\u00a0forgetting to stop and let you share, too. That\u2019s huge, because the difference\u00a0between the two people I just described is pretty huge, but the difference is also not huge because both are Autistic.\u00a0The two hypothetical people I described are part of the same \u201ctribe\u201d of\u00a0people.\u00a0If you look at them, they will seem totally different . . . which is\u00a0good, because they are not the same person! But\u00a0the neurology that is underlying those two very different types of relating (or not relating, if you wish) to others is of the same stuff. Also, did you notice that it says, \u201ccurrently or by history\u201d? Does the person being considered for diagnosis\u00a0have these traits now or did\u00a0they use to have them when\u00a0they were younger but have developed and grown away from some of them? That\u2019s a big deal, too. As you will see, there are other considerations for an autism spectrum diagnosis, but the person who\u00a0has become \u201cindistinguishable from their peers\u201d (whatever that means. It is a problematic phrase as Alyssa and Kassiane are currently\u00a0exploring in their blogs) might still be diagnosably\u00a0Autistic. That\u2019s something to consider before telling someone something like,\u00a0\u201cyou don\u2019t look\u00a0Autistic.\u201d There are many aspects of autism that are not immediately visible to the eye. And there is something I like to say, especially when people wonder why I don\u2019t resemble their six-year-old\u00a0Autistic child: \u201cdevelopmental delay does not mean developmental halt.\u201d We Autistics continue to develop and grow throughout the course of our lives. At age 46, I am still growing and developing in very dramatic and noticeable ways while non-autistic people do tend to get pretty solid by their twenties and don\u2019t really change a lot afterwards.\u00a0I\u2019m not making a value judgment! Both ways of developing are valid. I\u2019m just pointing out a huge difference and I am very glad to see that the authorial committee of the DSM-5 appears to have \u00a0noticed that, too, because you will see many different places in the text where they indicate a deep understanding of the ways that Autistic people change over time. So that\u2019s today\u2019s take-away:\u00a0 We no longer are choosing two or three things off a longer list. We have a fixed list of three things with section A: social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication behaviors, and relationships with others. But\u00a0within each of those three things, we have a range of different ways of being that\u00a0would fit into that\u00a0category. And each individual can express these criteria in a range of ways over the course of their life. I welcome discussion of the material I\u2019m posting in this DSM-5 series. And I will permit any comment anyone wants to make, so long as it is not advertising spam or something that reveals another person\u2019s private information or otherwise threatens others. Please do try to\u00a0be civil with one another, but know that during this discussion series I will not be practicing censorship at all \u2014 feel free to say what you really think. I promise you it\u2019s okay, even if I don\u2019t agree with you. I want this DSM-5 series to be a chance for people to really talk these ideas out without fear of reprisal. If you have a question specifically for me about the DSM-5 entry or anything related to this discussion, do call my attention to it by addressing me specifically (for those who might not know, my name is Sparrow, so\u00a0just start the comment with \u201cSparrow, [insert question]\u201d) and I will do my best, within the constraints of my time and knowledge, to answer.

I had no idea some of that stuff was in there. We (the Autism/Autistic Communities) were so worried about people losing their diagnoses that there wasn\u2019t much talk about what else was in there. Well, this post is the beginning of a series of posts about what the DSM 5 actually says. I will quote excerpts from it (it\u2019s copyrighted so I can\u2019t just share my scans with you all, much as I\u2019d love to) and I will paraphrase other parts of it so that I don\u2019t exceed fair use laws in my country.

Asheville, North Carolina, has become one of my\u00a0\u201cspiritual homes\u201d because it is\u00a0a beautiful, laid-back city with a vibrant and thriving Autistic community, thanks to the\u00a0tireless efforts of\u00a0more people than I could count. Despite the cold temperatures and snow (my nemesis!), I feel so blessed to have been able to participate in this terrific conference. The organizers were welcoming, friendly, and meticulous in seeing to every detail to maximize the comfort and safety of us Autistic presenters. My fellow presenters \u00a0are an amazing, wonderful, honest and lovely group of people. The audience was attentive, eager to hear what we had to say, and approached the whole event with open minds and open hearts. I was asked by more than one person if the text of my presentation would be available online. I promised I would put them in my very next blog post, so here it is. Also, most of the conference was filmed and I will have a video of this presentation at some point in the future, although the specific date is an unknown to me. I hope you enjoy my transcript and I look forward to being able to share the recording with you all soon. Autism and the Pursuit of Happiness, Keynote Address, February 13th, 2016 What is happiness? We are bombarded with messages every day addressing that question. The answers range from the classic white picket fence family with two children and a dog to owning the perfect shade of lipstick or sports car to savvy investments to eating a decadent ice cream treat. Happiness is promised in advertisements nearly as much as sex (which is also a culturally approved route to happiness.) But with all of our culture\u2019s near obsession with happiness, who is talking about Autistic happiness? I hear so much talk about therapy and meeting milestones and being table ready. Socializing with one\u2019s peer group and developing coping strategies. Addressing medical needs and finding good solutions for people with high support needs as their parents age. So many important aspects of autistic lives are discussed every day, but who stops to ask if we are happy, fulfilled, and enjoying our one and only precious lives? Today we are the ones who will talk about Autistic happiness. You will hear from people discussing elements of happiness such as self-acceptance and love, harmonious family life, sexuality, empathy, relationships, and more. Today is the day we answer back to society and talk about our Autistic views of happiness and its pursuit. Today we do not wait for society to tell us what will make us happy. Today we take charge of our own lives and we will tell society. Autism is filled with happiness. Our joy is like a bubbling spring that comes from deep within the earth, from deep inside of us. When that spring is allowed to flow, our happiness is visible, palpable. We are, like all humans, born to rejoice. Happiness is when everything is arranged by color and size. Happiness is when the last number fits and the puzzle is perfect. Happiness is when a special, trusted person is near. Happiness is a feast for the senses that is just right, not too little, not too much. Happiness is a delighted squeal, a flapping hand, a leap, a twirl. Happiness is the gentle sawtooth edge of a cat\u2019s purr. Happiness is the sparkle of water, the tickle of shifting sand, the squish of mud. Happiness is emptying the can of shaving cream and the entire roll of toilet paper just to see how they look and feel. Happiness is when the hard things get accomplished. Happiness is feeling competent. Happiness is learning new paths to success. Happiness is making and keeping friendships. Happiness is being able to help others. Happiness is sharing the things we love, talking about them, words tumbling out of our mouths like carbonation. Happiness is not talking, holding words and thoughts inside and not being required to dilute them by sharing them with others who might not get it anyway. I often describe myself as a fundamentally happy person. Happiness is my default state. It surprises me when others do not agree with that description, but one day I realized that the people who do not connect with the idea of me as a basically happy person are the people who rarely see me happy, often because they, themselves, are sources of unhappiness in my life. It has taught me to re-examine my relationship with anyone who does not share my view of myself as being a naturally happy person. That was such an important revelation for me. You see, happiness comes first from within, but the things and situations and people we are surrounded by can amplify or squelch our happiness. This is true for everyone, of course, but experience and observation suggests to me that we Autistic people are much more vulnerable to the input or interference of others for many reasons. We have to protect our precious happiness from those who would steal it from us. And it\u2019s hard, because not all of our happiness thieves are intentionally stealing our happiness. Some are even trying to increase our happiness, but in misguided ways that end up accomplishing the opposite effect. Others decrease our happiness because they weren\u2019t even thinking about us or they weren\u2019t thinking about us in supportive, understanding, and nurturing ways. So it\u2019s not just about looking for the bad people, because a lot of very good people can diminish our happiness without ever intending to. They can drain our happiness away so innocently that they are as confused as we are about where our happiness went and why it has gone away. So we develop shields to protect us \u2013 and sometimes those shields are helpful but sometimes they block out new happiness along with the risk of losing the happiness we already have. And we look for happiness allies, people who love to see us happy and do what they can to foster our happiness. In return, we can seek their happiness as well. Because one beautiful thing about happiness is that it can build on itself, spiraling upward higher and higher, just the same way that misery can twist backward on itself, spiraling us further down into the depths of despair.\u00a0 But it is much more wonderful to soar higher and higher on updrafts of happiness, so we seek out our happiness companions and help one another learn to fly together. At a conference dedicated to the pursuit of happiness, it feels contrary to talk about the things that inhibit or diminish or even crush happiness, but it is an important part of knowing what something is to understand what it is not as well. The darkness that snuffs out happiness can reveal the shape of the light that happiness is. Understanding those things that we Autistics are trying to shield our happiness from will help others to add their strength and love to our shield walls. Understanding the enemies of happiness helps us avoid innocently becoming one ourselves. Our goal is to help everyone to drink fully from their personal springs of happiness, chasing away the things that drill holes in us and let the happiness drain out until our buckets are empty. So often, it is a balancing act. For example, loneliness can empty a person\u2019s happiness bucket. Loneliness is different from being alone. Being alone can be soothing, familiar, friendly. Loneliness is when we feel forced to be alone. Loneliness is isolation and alienation. In loneliness it is easy to forget that we are loved and lovable. It is easy to forget that we are not alone. But loneliness cannot be eradicated simply by being around other people. I don\u2019t know about you, but when I am around the wrong people I feel far more isolated, more alienated, and more alone than I do when I\u2019m by myself. Well-meaning friends, family, and therapists have encouraged me to \u201cput myself out there\u201d when I\u2019m feeling lonely and low. It is the universal remedy to loneliness and depression after all. For years, I marveled because that advice really does seem to work for some people but it didn\u2019t work for me. When I am lonely and I go someplace where there are people, I feel worse. At first, I thought it was just me \u2013 a sign that I was hopelessly broken. Then I learned that I am Autistic and I decided for a while that it might be an autistic thing \u2013 being around people helps make loneliness and depression better, except not for Autistic people. But now I realize that\u2019s not the full truth, either. The reason we are advised to go out in public when we are depressed is that connecting with people is what helps us feel less lonely and less depressed. The more difficulty a person has in casually connecting with people, the less helpful the advice to \u201cput yourself out there.\u201d Being with others helps Autistic people feel less lonely and depressed, too, but we have to be more careful about who we choose to be around when we want to feel less lonely. Being around people who don\u2019t understand us, people who blame us for things that are out of our direct control, people who laugh at our differences, people who treat us like children even if we\u2019re adults \u2026 and, honestly, let\u2019s face it, even children don\u2019t like most of the ways that children are treated \u2026 these people will make us feel more lonely, more isolated, more depressed. And so the person who encouraged us to \u201cget out there and meet people\u201d has innocently contributed to draining our happiness even when they were trying to help patch and fill our bucket. This is one of the reasons many of us become afraid of going to therapy \u2013 if we get a well-meaning but clueless psychologist, they can innocently steer us in directions that turn out to be very bad for us. But I noticed that the times I didn\u2019t feel good and needed connection and specifically chose to go someplace with familiar people, people I knew understand and love me, people who feel happier when I am happier, people I am happy to see become happier, it really did lift my spirits and make me feel less alone. It really did patch my bucket and help me get it filled again from that mysterious inner spring from which so much happiness flows when it has not been blocked by loneliness. So finding happiness and helping others find happiness is a balancing act. Sometimes we all need to be alone, but sometimes we are lonely and in those lonely times someone can blunder when they try to help us by encouraging or even coercing us to go to the wrong places. Happiness is a balancing act and autistic happiness even more so. And because our happiness is filled and drained in ways that can be subtly different (or, really, hugely obvious) it is so much more important that we learn how to protect our happiness and seek out our happiness allies to support one another and to cherish happiness together. Our happiness thieves are not all so innocent and well-meaning, though. Some of the big bads we need to protect ourselves from, and often need support and assistance from others, are injustices and oppressions that disproportionately affect Autistic people and other vulnerable groups of people. Many Autistic people are in more than one vulnerable group, making so many of us even more vulnerable to the big bads. Three of the biggest of the big bads are abuse, poverty, and lack of healthcare access. Abuse is obvious \u2013 of course it drains happiness. What I was shocked to learn was how much more vulnerable we Autistic people are to abuse than the general population. Disabled people, in general, are at three times the risk of physical and sexual abuse compared to the general population and Autistic people are among the most vulnerable of all disabled people. Just one example: a study found that 83% of women with developmental disabilities have been sexually assaulted at least once in our lives. The same study discovered that 49% of people with intellectual disability experience sexual abuse or assault at least ten times over the course of their life. If these figures shock you, they should. I have faced repeated abuse in my own life and still it shocked me to learn how widespread the experience of abuse is among people with autism and other disabilities. There are other kinds of abuse, too. Twenty percent of disabled people using a third-party payer system are passed from person to person, used as units of commerce by people who collect their disability money and give very little care in return, if any. That\u2019s one-fifth of those on third-party who are only cared for the very minimum amount required to keep them alive so the money keeps coming in. And, at the risk of overwhelming you with the big bads, I also want to remind you that so much of what gets reported as \u201cabuse and neglect\u201d is actually rape, assault, and even murder, the crimes verbally downplayed by a system that views disabled people differently and, as a result, often fails to protect us. Poverty is another big bad that drains happiness away. A British study found only 15% of Autistics had full-time employment. Many of us struggle on disability benefits that leave most of us surviving at 20% below the official poverty threshold. And I have known several Autistic people who have no income, no disability, no family to support them. Their lives can only be described with phrases like \u201ccrushing poverty\u201d since merely saying \u201cpoverty\u201d does not begin to convey their experiences. For many years, I knew them because I lived among them, crushed under the weight of lack myself. Twice the number of Autistics, per capita live in poverty than the poverty percentages of the general population. Transitioning from one\u2019s family of origin to independent living is so difficult. Finding and keeping employment is a huge challenge. Struggling to keep a roof over one\u2019s head with no or very little income feels like a losing battle every day. These hefty challenges leave little room for personal growth, rest, creativity, socializing, and, of course, happiness. The big bad of healthcare access drains happiness away through frustration, overload, and poor health. Too many Autistics had spotty healthcare, at best, before the Affordable Care Act and\u00a0 the ACA hasn\u2019t significantly helped increase access. Look at Mel Baggs and Paul Corby to see especially grievous cases of Autistic people being denied lifesaving medical care. Baggs had to fight for a feeding tube for zir gastroparesis due to being a non-speaking Autistic adult. Corby is still trying to get on a heart transplant waiting list despite being young and in excellent health other than his heart disease but he is being denied access to a transplant solely based on his autism. Our healthcare system is failing our most vulnerable citizens. These are the battles we have to fight in our pursuit of happiness. These are the big bads we must all be joined against if we are going to be one another\u2019s happiness allies. In this battle, the strategy that works for each of will necessarily be different. We are divergent in many ways and there are many different flavors of autism and many different support needs and combinations of support needs. There are many different skill sets among us and many different challenges. But all of this can be said of the entire collection of human beings. We are as much similar as we are different \u2013 similar to other Autistics, similar to other human beings. To find happiness, we must be understood in both our similarities and our differences, not just one or the other. I have found happiness. Most of my life it seemed impossibly elusive and I still struggle to protect my precious joy, but I am here to tell you that the Autistic pursuit of happiness is not a futile quest. I have had to color outside the lines and think outside the box in order to find happiness. As a matter of fact, I don\u2019t just think outside the box \u2013 I live outside the box. I did my research and weighed my options and as a result I moved into my van because it is much more affordable than an apartment and gives me the freedom to move around, meeting other Autistics and working to increase understanding and acceptance of our different perceptions, our different lives, our different needs \u2026. and our commonalities as well. I know the life I have chosen is not for everybody, Autistic or not. For starters, I love driving and am pretty good at it, if I can say so myself. Most of my friends are not able to drive. Nearly all of my Autistic friends are unable to drive for a variety of reasons. I live in a very small space, which is also something that doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone (although I like to joke that my home may be small but my yard is three million square miles. How can I feel cramped with that much space to explore?) I have a lot of variety in my life, but I have found ways to build in the comforting routines that keep me grounded and happy. The main point of mentioning my alternate life style is that it is a way of living I chose for myself. I found the strength and courage to make a change. I found the power and autonomy to choose for myself. I surrounded myself with supportive people who were also excited about my choice and could help me sort through questions and problems that arose. This is what fosters happiness. Happiness is not a specific lifestyle, it is the ability to make decisions for yourself and be treated with respect and dignity, as a person who is capable of knowing what they want from life. Happiness is the freedom to choose and the support to make those choices into reality. This is what I want for all Autistic people: To have our competence respected, to have our support needs met with dignity, to be encouraged to build a life that serves our needs and wants. It seems to me that these are small things to ask for but so often it feels as if we are asking for mountains to be moved. Why are such basic things treated so often as unreasonable? But they are building blocks that are fundamental to the pursuit of happiness. Yes, a person can find happiness in the most extreme circumstances. Viktor Frankl taught us this in his classic book,  Man\u2019s Search for Meaning . But if we are committed to fostering the Autistic pursuit of happiness, we cannot dismiss the importance of smoothing the way for happiness to flow freely. Just because humans are capable of finding happiness in the deepest pit doesn\u2019t mean it is right for us to leave even one person lacking in the freedoms and supports that so many other people inherit as their birthright. Many of the things you will hear from presenters today will elaborate on themes I have barely touched on this morning. Listen with an open heart and open mind. These discussions of pursuing happiness are long overdue in the autism world. They are inextricably intertwined with issues of health and safety, survival and growth. The Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. quoted the prophet Amos, speaking of \u201cjustice rolling down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\u201d When that righteous flood of justice roars through our valley, sweeping away the stones of restriction, oppression, stereotypes, and obstacles that crush us and dam our fountains of natural joy, we will be free to unfurl our tender roots. Nourished by our own flowing happiness, we will stretch our arms high, like branches growing upward, grasping the very rim of the sun. Our laughter will tumble down like birdsong as we pull ourselves and one another higher and higher still, rising on our tide of happiness, reaching ever toward an unlimited sky of dreams beyond today\u2019s imagining. The pursuit of Autistic happiness begins right here, today, as we uncap the well and drink joyously together. Thank you for joining us today. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/autism-and-the-pursuit-of-happiness/", "title": "Autism and The Pursuit of Happiness"},

That was a significant event for me because it made me angry enough to change from anonymously blogging to writing openly under my name, thanks to a movement, led by blogger Jill Smo, for all of us developmentally disabled people to show our faces and let Ann Coulter know who she was hurting. By choosing to use the R-word as an insult, thus using our disability as a bludgeon with which to beat others, Coulter showed a crass disregard for others, especially more vulnerable members of society. Coulter believes it only hurts the person she aims the R-word at, but she is wrong. It hurts all of us because hurtful words chip away at the foundation of civility and disregard for the humanity of disabled people destroys the humanity of the offender most of all. This week, Coulter did it again, using the R-word when  she tried to defend presidential candidate Donald Trump for mocking a disabled journalist . Clearly, Coulter is not reachable or teachable. But I want to re-blog my original post from October 23, 2012 anyway because it was a landmark post for me: the moment I stepped out of the shadows and came out publicly as Autistic. I was in graduate school and was being harassed and bullied by a fellow student who was threatening to tell my department about my disability. I decided to make his threats moot by coming out and I\u2019ve never looked back since. Until now. \ud83d\ude42 So here\u2019s my post in the original, except for the photograph of me which somehow got lost along the way. I\u2019ve substituted in a more recent picture of me, but all the text remains as it was in the original post. Thanks for reading. To Ann Coulter: Calling Our President the R-word Was Beyond Inappropriate \noriginally published by Unstrange Mind on October 23, 2012 Ann Coulter has made a name for herself by being angry, offensive, and over-the-top. She does it so often that most of\u00a0us just ignore what she says. But I have to speak up about the twitter message she posted after the third presidential debate: Ann Coulter\u2019s offensive tweet from 2012. It reads: I highly approve of Romney\u2019s decision to be kind and gentle to the retard. This is wrong on so many levels! A pejorative term based on a medical label for a vulnerable and disenfranchised population is not an appropriate insult. One blogger, jillsmo of the blog  Yeah. Good Times ., has written a post protesting Coulter\u2019s choice of words.  Dear @AnnCoulter: This is who you insult with your words . In this entry, jillsmo asks for all disabled people who have been called \u201cretard\u201d to post a photo to show Ann Coulter the real faces of the people she is insulting when she uses the r-word as a pejorative. I felt this was a perfect post to re-open my blog with. Some of you may remember the blog I kept here two years ago. I was blogging anonymously at that time and a colleague at my university began making hateful posts here and threatening to out me in my department as autistic. (Not that many people would have been terribly surprised. Despite being deeply in the closet at the time and struggling to pass as neurotypical, I\u2019m \u201cstrange\u201d enough that no one was fooled. They may not have figured out my exact diagnostic label, but anyone who got to know me figured out pretty quickly that there was \u201csomething up\u201d with me.) I was so upset by the attack and I feared so much for my position at my university and my future career that I closed down this blog. Now I\u2019m ready to re-open it and I\u2019m ready to come out of the neurodiversity closet. Now is the time to post my photo and let Ann Coulter see who she hurts when she uses \u201cretard\u201d as an insult. She hurts me, Sparrow Rose Jones, doctoral candidate at Idaho State University: Sparrow Rose Jones My official diagnosis is Asperger\u2019s Syndrome (soon to be\u00a0\u201cAutism Spectrum Disorder: Severity Level 1\u201d when the DSM-5 comes out in May of 2013.) I first recall being called retarded in first grade. I would slip out of my desk and crawl on the floor to the back of the room where I\u2019d hide under the table. If I was caught, I\u2019d begin meowing like a cat. I was reading at a high level but refused to participate in reading lessons. I did not interact normally with the other children and my teacher did everything in her power to have me removed from her classroom (and eventually succeeded.) I may have been called retarded before that point \u2013 I certainly demonstrated severe impairments in pre-school and kindergarten. But Miss Katzman, my first grade teacher, is the first person I know of to have used the term in reference to me. Through the years, many other people have called me \u201cretarded\u201d or \u201cretard.\u201d A few times I\u2019ve been called \u201cmental,\u201d which I assume either means retarded or mentally ill. I have been at the grocery store and overheard: \u201csee that girl over there? Is she retarded?\u201d I have been asked to my face: \u201care you retarded or what?\u201d And I had to undergo a battery of tests so my school could decide what to do with me after Miss Katzman declared me to be retarded and unsuited for her classroom. So, Ann Coulter, this is the face of one of the many people you have insulted and deeply offended with your off-hand remark. I am sensitive, I am vulnerable, and I have a lot to offer the world if I am given the chance to do it and not stymied by the sorts of judgments that tend to come from a society that thinks words like \u201cretard\u201d are appropriate insults. I stand in solidarity with everyone else who has ever had the term \u201cretard\u201d slung at them for any reason. We are many different sorts of people from many different walks of life with many different talents and traits of value. Every time the r-word is thrown about, all of us are devalued. All of us suffer. And all of society suffers as a reult of what is lost when we are treated like jokes, like garbage, like useless nothings suited only to be used as a comparison when one wants to say nasty things about other people. I am proud to welcome President Obama into our ranks. No, he is not from the same vulnerable underclass as many of the rest of us who have had the r-word slung in our direction. But he has shown recently that he cares about us and wants to help us live fuller, richer lives. I welcome you, Obama, as an honorary member of our group. You are our ally. Ann Coulter has used our existence to slap you with. You, on the other hand, have listened to our difficulties and created legislation designed to support and accommodate our needs so that we can move into more fulfilling, more productive lives. I think it is obvious, between\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0and Ann Coulter, which is the one with valuable things to say and do with respect to the more vulnerable members of our society\u00a0and which is the one working to maintain an oppressive status quo under which vulnerable people are little more than tools to be used for insulting others. Coulter has done one useful thing, however. She has inspired me to come out of my disability closet. I\u2019m here and I\u2019m willing to be counted. And as long as there is breath in my lungs or muscles twitching in my fingers, I will use my voice and my words to speak out against stigma and\u00a0injustice.

The movie title is in red on a blue background. The top half of Owen Suskind\u2019s head is at the bottom of the image and line drawings of figures from Disney animated movies surround him.] Life, Animated: A Review Last night I went with friends to the Portland Museum of Art in Portland, Maine, to see the indie documentary,  Life, Animated . Life, Animated  is  based on a book by Ron Suskind , a journalist and father to Owen Suskind, the Autistic young man who is the film\u2019s subject and an absolute delight. Owen\u2019s greatest love in life is Disney movies and these films have sustained him through many dark years of isolation and bullying (years Owen calls \u201cglop\u201d) as well as all the disappointments and tragedies a well-lived life can bring. And Owen\u2019s life is well-lived, indeed. He is a charming man, a natural leader, and a deep thinker. I write this review as an Autistic adult, myself, and I found much in this movie that made me rejoice. I confess that I was troubled by some of the language used, for example when Owen\u2019s father talks about feeling as if someone had kidnapped his child, then later discovers Owen was \u201cstill in there\u201d and sets himself about a \u201crescue mission\u201d to \u201cpull him out\u201d of the \u201cprison of autism.\u201d I was torn at those points in the movie, between an empathy for Owen\u2019s family, feeling themselves at a loss to communicate effectively with their child and a heavy feeling in my heart at hearing an Autistic person described that way. But I came away from the movie realizing that Owen, himself, had similar feelings about his relationship to the world. While he never directly said, \u201cbeing an Autistic child was like living in a prison,\u201d he talks about feeling so overwhelmed by all the sounds around him that fought for his attention and made people\u2019s voices \u201ca garble.\u201d And when Owen talks about his glop years, he is clearly distressed by how badly he was bullied and how lonely he felt. Ron tells a story of connecting with Owen through a hand-puppet of Iago, the parrot from the Disney animated film  Aladdin.  When Ron spoke to Owen through Iago, Owen said \u00a0 that he was sad because he had no friends. I realized that, as much as I hate the phrase \u201cprison of autism\u201d and how it puts all the blame for communication barriers on the Autistic person and implies that we are the ones who must do all the work to enter someone else\u2019s world, Owen\u2019s experience of growing up Autistic must have felt very much like being imprisoned in glop. I also came to terms with Ron\u2019s use of language because he didn\u2019t simply decide that Owen was \u201clocked away\u201d \u00a0and had to come join \u201cthe real world,\u201d but, together with his wife, Cornelia, and Owen\u2019s older brother, Walter, he entered Owen\u2019s world. When the family realized that Owen was using Disney movies to communicate, the whole family used Owen\u2019s love of Disney as an entry portal to join him in his world. That was what made this movie so beautiful to me: that the family encouraged Owen\u2019s deep love for Disney and found their way into his world. Suddenly autism isn\u2019t as much of a \u201cprison\u201d when the whole family has opened that door with love and performed their \u201crescue\u201d by entering and joining Owen. I recommend this movie to anyone with a compassionate heart. Owen will charm you. His life progress will cheer you. The way Owen feels his pain deeply will move you. Owen\u2019s ability to process his pain and move through it to the happiness beyond will impress you. Owen is a man with a powerful vision of justice, loyalty, and independence. While his father produced it, this is Owen\u2019s film in every aspect. Owen\u2019s parents and brother worry about what will happen to Owen when his parents have aged and passed away, but Owen will be just fine and we, the viewers, see that when Owen pauses  The Lion King  to ask the Disney club he formed at his school, \u201cwhat was Mustafa teaching Simba?\u201d Members of the club offer insightful responses and Owen agrees, summing up their words by saying, \u201cwhen our parents can no longer help us, we have to figure out things on our own.\u201d Owen is figuring things out. He is moving forward into the world, \u201ca little bit nervous and a little bit excited,\u201d and discovering that he can succeed as an adult without losing the magic and wonder of childhood. He has memorized every Disney film and he has internalized the valuable lessons they teach about friendship, courage, and honor. His parents still get teary-eyed when they talk about the early days when Owen was first diagnosed with autism. But only moments later, they are clearly bursting with pride at what a lovely, strong man Owen has grown to be. \u00a0Owen is, in his own words, \u201ca proud Autistic man.\u201d The viewer will leave the theater feeling proud of Owen, too. I found his journey through the darkness of glop and back into the light, with the help of the timeless Disney stories, inspirational for my own journey through the glop of anxiety and depression, loneliness and bullying, isolation and deprivation. Owen has saved his own life with stories and, in the process, become a storyteller in his own right. Owen\u2019s prison was not autism. He is still Autistic and he will always be Autistic. Owen\u2019s prison was isolation from others. What saved Owen\u2019s life was not being pulled out of autism, as if that were even possible. (It\u2019s not. Autism is how his brain is wired and as deep a part of who he is as the Disney stories he loves so much.) What saved Owen was communication. When Owen\u2019s family learned how to communicate with him, they opened a path of connection that grew stronger every day. For me, the strongest messages  Life, Animated  brings to parents of Autistic children is to never give up on finding a way to communicate with your child and never give up on helping your child find a way to communicate with the world. At one point, Owen communicated by repeating a line from  The Little Mermaid  over and over: \u201cjust your voice. Just your voice.\u201d Owen\u2019s pediatrician said it was merely echolalia, signifying nothing. Ron seemed to agree with the assessment on the surface, but beneath that agreement, he clearly harbored a secret hope that it  did  signify something. In my opinion, Ron was right. Echolalia  is  communication, as many parents of Autistic children who speak in quotes will quickly tell you. Many Autistic adults who were echolalic when younger (or still are as adults) but have developed a more independent voice will agree: when they were, or are, echolalic, communication is still happening on their part, even when it\u2019s not getting picked up and understood by the recipient. Ron did not so quickly dismiss the echolalia as meaningless. Moreover, at one point in the film, Ron extends the question of meaning, asking, \u201cwho decides what a meaningful life is?\u201d Ron never directly answers that question, but he doesn\u2019t have to. Owen has a meaningful life by anyone\u2019s measure. But the only measure that really matters in the end is Owen\u2019s. Owen said he didn\u2019t feel like a hero; he felt like a sidekick. But in re-making the Disney canon into a story that was truly his, he rose to become a hero among sidekicks and the protector of them all. Owen has crafted a meaningful life on his terms. Life, Animated  is a celebration of communication, of victory, and of an Autistic life well-lived. I hope you have a chance to see it soon yourself. The film offers much to think about and discuss as our culture struggles to understand what autism is and how Autistics can be welcomed and honored as full participants in society. We can be helped\u00a0to find our\u00a0own way in the world as narrators of our own life stories. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/life-animated-a-review/", "title": "Life, Animated: A Review"},

As I suspected, the slur is there. You can see  photos of it on my Facebook Page . \u00a0TIME Magazine and Joel Stein owe the Autistic community a HUGE apology for using our neurology as a slur. Dear Time Magazine and Joel Stein, I am Autistic. In your article published online this morning, you engage in the behavior you purport to bemoan. You have trolled me on the internet. You see, I was already having a pretty horrible day today. It started with my usual morning activity: crunching the numbers and figuring out if I will be able to survive another month. \u00a0I have a really hard time keeping myself fed because I have multiple disabilities, including hypernychthemeral syndrome, which is like having my sleep-wake symphony conducted for an orchestra playing on Mars. No one wants to hire an Autistic who can\u2019t stay awake, so I have been living 20 percent below the poverty threshold on government benefits while trying to build enough income through writing to support myself and my cat. We live in my van and we\u2019ll make it another month, but only if I stop off at Salvation Army to pick up boxes of food. Your article writes about a culture of hate online? Try living with half a dozen serious disabilities in the culture of hate that is everywhere around us. I\u2019m talking about that culture that is always angry about \u201cthose people\u201d who live off the government. I\u2019m trying, I really am. But I started out behind the eight ball and it\u2019s really hard to see my way out of poverty from back here. So after that refreshing morning activity, I turned to this blog, writing an entry about how desperately disabled people need to be able to have emergency savings funds. We aren\u2019t allowed to because if we have too much money, our benefits get taken away and we have no medical coverage, no place to live, nothing to eat. So we have to live on thin ice, hoping we never have an emergency or end up stuck with an abuser. In the case of Autistics, good luck on that last count. 83% of women with developmental disabilities have been sexually assaulted at least once in our lives. That\u2019s dangerously close to all of us. And half have been assaulted more than ten times. More than ten times. Imagine that for a moment. Imagine the level of hatred a person would feel like their entire culture had leveled against people like them to allow such a travesty. That, Time Magazine and Joel Stein, that is a culture of hate. You wonder why we\u2019re losing the internet to a culture of hate? Have you lifted your head from your computer screen and looked around you lately? The internet is embedded in a culture of hate. It goes far beyond me and my petty problems, but let\u2019s get back to my problems for now since you are part of them today. After writing my blog entry about how hard it is for Autistic people to avoid getting abused by everyone who walks through our lives, given that so few of us have savings to fall back on when people start leveraging our fundamental human needs against us\u2026not to mention those of us not allowed to have savings. Or marry. Did you realize that people on SSI lose a quarter of our income if we marry? And those of us living in group homes are often forbidden to have a romantic life at all. Our lives are carefully managed for us and too often our options are rebel and end up in a worse situation or quietly put up with what we have. Anyway, after writing about that, I took an academic survey about Autistic lives, social media, and quality of life. That survey dropped me into a pretty deep funk. You see, there were a couple of questions that were a one-two punch to my gut: \u201cPlease describe what the phrase \u201cquality of life\u201d means to you. Please also share what quality of life means for your own life.\u201d This question was almost too difficult to answer. All I could manage to do was define the phrase \u2018quality of life\u2019: \u201cQuality of life is the assessment of how much or little a life is worth continuing versus committing suicide.\u201d That primed the pump and the next question was where the devastation really occurred: \u201cHow would you describe how autism affects your quality of life?\u201d Time Magazine, Joel Stein, I\u2019m going to clean up my language for you now. This is the censored version of what those academic researchers got from me: \u201cAutism does not affect my quality of life. The way the world treats people like me is what really messes with my quality of life. Then, as a nifty little reward for the PTSD I live with after putting up with a life of abuse for being different and predation for being extra vulnerable, the world tries to decide for itself whether I have quality of life or not. The world stops asking me and people like me if we think we have quality of life and decides people like me shouldn\u2019t even exist. It dives deep into research on how to detect us early so we can be removed from our mothers\u2019 wombs. Autism is fine. It is abusive jerks who refuse to understand what autism really is who are, to paraphrase Orwell, stamping on my quality of life like a jackboot smashing a human face forever.\u201d That is the culture of hate in which I live. It is a culture where the late Suzanne Wright of Autism Speaks was applauded for telling the Pope that we are innocents with no financial cares. She said we were like lepers and our parents were like Saint Francis, nobly taking care of us despite our affliction. She said that and I listened and I wept because I can\u2019t afford to feed myself. I have friends who are starving, who live in housing without running water, who live with daily abuse. I have friends who have barely managed to leave facilities where they were repeatedly, painfully shocked on their skin any time they expressed a personal desire, such as wanting to leave their coat on instead of taking it off. I have friends who live in fear because their Autistic teens are large and Black and growing facial hair and that puts them in line to be the next Reginald Latson or Arnaldo Soto. Sadly, white Autistics don\u2019t fare much better. Just ask the survivors of David Levi Dehmann or Kayden Clarke. And here, into my not-so-awesome day in this not-so-awesome culture of hate we\u2019re all steeped in, comes your article. When you, Joel Stein, wrote these words and you, Time Magazine, published them, did you not get the irony of asking how the internet was turning into a culture of hate-filled trolls as you used my disability as a bludgeon? Did you not realize that you were crafting words of hate that are massively damaging to a population that already suffers hate and abuse? Did it not occur to you that your words would feed the depression of countless Autistics \u2014 myself among them \u2014 who grapple with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and a pervasive feeling that we live in a world that would rather see us dead than help us have quality of life? Did you realize that there are studies out there that have found that youth with Asperger\u2019s have a suicide rate 28 times higher than non-autistic peers? Did it occur to you that your words are exactly the sort of brickbats that contribute to that astronomically high rate? You are part of the problem you attempted to describe. If you truly care about a culture of hate on the internet, you will retract your hate speech. You will apologize to Autistics and people with Asperger\u2019s. You will do something active to make this world a better, safer, less hate-filled place for Autistic people, and you will never again deem it appropriate to use a vulnerable disabled population to make a pithy point. We are not your linguistic color; we are human beings. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/an-open-letter-to-time-magazine-and-joel-stein/", "title": "An Open Letter to Time Magazine and Joel Stein"},

It\u2019s especially important if your child is Autistic to prepare them for the world with  specific \u00a0advice about how the world works. So often, we need to have things spelled out for us. We need step-by-step plans. We need to get a peek into the future and know what to expect. I know some of my Autistic friends are great at spotting patterns and protecting themselves, but I, as you probably already realize if you\u2019ve been reading my writing for more than about two minutes, was not so lucky. I learned a lot about how abusive the world can be and I learned it in what they call the School of Hard Knocks. I\u2019m still learning it. I still get knocked up against pretty hard by a difficult world. Being on disability, I\u2019m not permitted to have savings. I\u2019m going to explain to you now why that is so dangerous. It\u2019s going to scare you. It should scare you. I hope it scares you into action. The ABLE Act \u00a0is great and will help a lot of people, but there are restrictions (and that\u2019s why I wrote last year about the importance of saving every scrap of documentation of disability while your child is young.) The ABLE Act is a new law that allows disabled people to have savings accounts (a single 529a savings plan of up to $100,000, permitting donations of up to $14,000/year), to be used for specific purposes, without losing disability benefits. That\u2019s huge and could affect nearly 6 million disabled people, although it\u2019s only begun being implemented in a few states so far. But the catch is that you have to have a disability onset before age 26. And, more than that, you have to prove that date of onset and get the government to agree with your proof. My age of onset is long, long before age 26 and I have documents from age 19 that prove it\u2026or should. The government has looked at my paperwork, documenting institutionalization for the same disability I\u2019m currently collecting SSI for having, and declared that it doesn\u2019t count. \u00a0So I can\u2019t use the ABLE Act to build a savings account to save me in case of disaster and I can\u2019t switch to SSDI Adult-Child benefits (which would increase my income and put me under a much less draconian set of rules than I currently live under on SSI.) I\u2019m working toward becoming self-supporting, but I\u2019m nearly 50 now and still barely earning any income. There\u2019s a strong chance I may never achieve my goal of self-sufficiency and may never live at or above the poverty threshold. But I digress. Today I want to talk about why it\u2019s so important to create a world where disabled people are able to have savings. And I want to start with a Reddit thread that\u2019s in the process of going viral. A friend on Facebook shared this link. I\u2019ll give you the link but I\u2019m also going to summarize it for you because it\u2019s a long link (and I do recommend reading every single comment on it if you do go there. And I do recommend going there. It\u2019s both instructive and amusing\u2013that schadenfreudian amusement of watching an abuser in distress about getting what\u2019s coming to him.) My Girlfriend Elaborately Made Me Homeless Here\u2019s my summary of what transpires on that thread: A man hit his girlfriend. She went away for a few days but came back. He apologized. She accepted his apology but lost trust in him (as well she should have.) When they moved from their apartment to a nicer apartment owned by the same landlord, she gave him airy dismissals when he asked about signing the lease and he accepted them because he liked letting her deal with the numbers and money and stuff. She had good credit and his was trashed so her credit got them the apartment in the first place. He didn\u2019t think much of it when he asked about signing the lease and she said, \u201coh, that\u2019s all taken care of\u201d \u00a0or something equally breezy. Fast forward and he\u2019s getting angry again, they\u2019re having \u201cspats\u201d (his word for it) in which the police arrive to settle things. Then one day he goes to work and comes home to find all her stuff gone and a lawyer serving him a document requiring him to move out within 45 days and not contact his (former) girlfriend. He\u2019s distressed and outraged but can do nothing \u2013 she has played her hand well and he will be gone and she will get the nice apartment back and go on with her life minus one abuser. People are, justifiably, applauding this woman\u2019s bold move. She is, quite understandably, a hero in her own life story and a role model. She got out of an abusive relationship without putting herself at physical risk to do so. There\u2019s just one thing: this smooth and bloodless self-extraction is not available to most people in situations of domestic abuse. The woman had a lot of resources available to her that Autistic adults often do not have. And one of the biggest ones? Savings. This is why I keep telling you to work harder to extend the ABLE Act. It\u2019s great that it helps millions of people. That\u2019s not enough. This is also why I keep telling you to teach your children how to say no and mean it and back up their no with action. I have a book coming out very, very soon. I don\u2019t have a specific release date, but it\u2019s teetering on the threshold even as I type. It\u2019s called  The ABCs of Autism Acceptance,  published by\u00a0 Autonomous Press , and I have a whole chapter about the abuse that Autistic people cope with every day. The statistics are so huge, even my jaw dropped when I was researching it and I am hard to shock when it comes to the knowledge that Autistic people are vulnerable to victimization (yes, it\u2019s chapter V in the book. How did you guess?) Not having financial resources is one of the things (not the only thing, but a huge thing) that keeps us so vulnerable. Even with all my experience and all my knowledge and all my determination for self-determination, I still ended up in a situation in April of this year where I needed the police to come supervise as I left someone\u2019s house to make sure I was able to leave with all my possessions and without being physically harmed. It could have been a lot worse than it was. And I was lucky that I already live in my van because otherwise I might not have even tried to leave, knowing I had no money and no place to go. In the Reddit thread I\u2019ve linked above, one person wrote a comment in which they included a link to a sort of \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d story about a young professional woman who gets trapped in an abusive relationship and an abusive job due to financial pressures. The story then \u201crewinds\u201d \u00a0and tells itself again with the young woman choosing to build a (pardon the language) \u201cFuck Off Fund\u201d so that she doesn\u2019t get stuck in a sexually harassing job and with a verbally and physically abusive boyfriend because she has savings. She has a minimum of $3000 savings, which is more than I\u2019m allowed to have. The government would cut off my benefits if I had $3000 in savings and I\u2019m not an up-and-coming young professional so that\u2019s a pretty big deal for me. Here\u2019s the story. I also recommend reading it, even though I\u2019ve just given you a pretty good summary of what you\u2019ll find there: A Story of a Fuck Off Fund No matter what you call that savings account, it\u2019s a lifeline. It\u2019s a way out of abuse. Autistic people get abused every day: by romantic partners, by landlords, by bosses, by neighbors, by family, by roommates, by caregivers. The list goes on. We are incredibly vulnerable because we live in a world that has kept us incredibly vulnerable. So many of us live on disability income that functions under legislation that keeps us in a child-like state our entire life, stripping our autonomy and self-determination. Another large slice of our demographic are chronically underemployed, struggling to get by on minimum wage or less \u2014 and I\u2019m talking about young people with bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in this group. The super-successful among us who get held up as cultural icons (I don\u2019t actually have to name their names, right? You know who I\u2019m talking about.) are the exception, not the rule. We Autistics deserve something better. We deserve a better life. And we deserve a savings fund. Sure, some people will fritter away their money like the first example in the \u201cFuck You Fund\u201d article I\u2019ve linked above. But for so many disabled people, for so many Autistic adults, it\u2019s not a case of frittering anything away because we don\u2019t even have it to start with. When you are preparing your child for the world and preparing the world for your child, think about these things. No matter what future you envision for your child, make sure it\u2019s one with an emergency savings fund and protected access to it \u2014 protected from victimizers who would try to take it for their own and protected from those who would try to deny your child access to it in times of genuine need. And beyond that, educate your child to protect them from abusers. Teach them that no means no. Teach them to own their bodies and money and minds and lives. Teach them to be strong and proud. Whether they\u2019re headed off to college and a career or headed into a life of round the clock support, teach them. These are scalable skills that can be tailored to any life, any life situation. The way I use my skills of self-protection as a traveling vandweller will look different from the way an Autistic university professor uses skills of self-protection and different from the way an Autistic living in a group home uses skills of self-protection, but we can all be taught how to own our power and defend our boundaries and protect our lives from the predators that all of us are going to encounter in our lives because Autistic vulnerability does not respect these apparent differences and strikes hard at all of us. There is so much more I could say about this, but I have a lot to get done today, so I\u2019ll just stop here. I encourage you all to discuss these things in the comment section. Share resources with one another. Get to know one another. I have a wide variety of readers, \u00a0from fellow Autistic adults to parents of Autistic children and parents of Autistic adults to professionals who work with Autistic people and our families in many different capacities. Get to know each other and talk about this important issue and help all of us move forward when it comes to protecting Autistic lives without removing Autistic autonomy and self-determination. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://unstrangemind.com/how-having-savings-saves-you/", "title": "How Having Savings Saves You"}
