{"date": "Wednesday, December 02, 2015", "body": "\nIn the  Carter  decision , the Supreme Court of Canada\u00a0struck down the existing prohibition against physician-assisted dying, and gave the Canadian government until February 2016 to craft a legislative response. In response, an expert panel was created; see more information about the panel,  Carter , and assisted dying\u00a0 here . Very late in the panel's consultations, I was asked to provide comments about assisted dying and autism. My very brief submission, possibly too late to be considered, is below, along with a few further notes.\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \nMy purpose is not to take any position on the issue of physician-assisted dying, but to call attention to the situation of autistic adults in Canada with respect to this issue.\u00a0 \n \nAutistic adults will be affected by laws on physician-assisted dying in as many ways and in as many roles as will nonautistic adults. For example, autistic adults may be patients or physicians and as such may variously wish to obtain, to avoid, to provide, or not to provide assisted death.\u00a0 \n \nWhat sets autistic adults apart is their difficult situation in Canada when it comes to basic scientific, medical, and ethical standards\u2014standards which are often described as universal. These are the standards on which the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC)  Carter  decision implicitly and explicitly depends. The decision\u2019s premise is that these standards will indeed benefit and protect everyone, whatever their role or wishes with regard to assisted dying.\u00a0 \n \nWhile this premise is sound for the nonautistic population, for autistics in Canada it fails and must be rejected. Autistics have long been denied the \u201cuniversal\u201d basic standards on which  Carter  depends. There is a long history of scientific and ethical standards being lowered or discarded in autism research, a long history of unfounded but dominant claims that basic standards are somehow bad for autistics, or are too difficult to apply, or are not merited by this population. Lower standards for autistics than would be acceptable for anyone else have spread well beyond research and now permeate autism practice, advocacy, jurisprudence, journalism, policy, and politics.\u00a0 \n \nIn Canada there is no organization which promotes basic scientific, medical, and ethical standards for autistics. To the contrary, any suggestion that standards for autistics should resemble those for everyone else has been strongly opposed. This is reflected in public policy and generally in how autistics are regarded and treated in every aspect of their lives.\u00a0 \n \nUnder the dominant low standards, autism is viewed as grievous, as irremediable (beyond a tiny early window of opportunity), as causing enduring intolerable suffering, as an appalling burden on families and society. Media stories have mentioned individuals in Belgium euthanized for autism (Lerner & Caplan, 2015). A recent paper, while very preliminary, found that autistic adults seeking assisted dying are not mere rumors (Theinpont  et al. , 2015).\u00a0 \n \nWhat the SCC\u2019s  Carter  decision means with respect to autism is unclear. We are not in Belgium\u2019s \u201cvery different medico-legal culture.\u201d But in Canada autistics are subject to \u201cvery different\u201d and profoundly lower standards than the court envisioned. This has consequences for autistics even if autism itself is not or does not become a condition for which assisted dying is granted.\u00a0 \n \nAdults diagnosed as autistic disproportionately experience suicide, suicidality, and premature death (Lai & Baron-Cohen, 2015; Hirvikoski  et al ., 2015), plausibly as the predictable outcomes of being subject to unacceptably low standards. It remains to be seen how enduring intolerable suffering will be assessed and treated in these circumstances, which the SCC did not envision. The obvious solution, the only one consistent with the Charter, is to accord to autistics the universal scientific, medical, and ethical standards they are currently denied. So long as this does not happen, autistics in Canada do not fall under the overarching premise of the  Carter  decision. In all aspects of assisted dying, they will face hazardous, onerous, and unacceptable disadvantages.\u00a0 \n \n References\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \nHirvikoski, T., Mittendorfer-Rutz, E., Boman, M., Larsson, H., Lichtenstein, P., & B\u00f6lte, S.

{"date": "Thursday, April 12, 2012", "body": "\n Before I forget how to blog again, some excerpts from a  live Q & A  I did in the UK recently, while at the  Centre for Research in Autism and Education  in London. I've corrected one typo. It was very hard to do but the questions were excellent. Darren Sharif: Was research something you always felt you had been quite good at, statistics, numbers etc? And what support network did you have to start this job?  Michelle Dawson:  No, I ran into research by accident--as I was trying to sort out legal issues. Then suddenly I had information I could really work with. Before that I had been totally discouraged from even looking at research--I was told that autistics could not understand research.   I haven't really had support, I just leveled a lot of criticism at a research group I took seriously and they offered me an affiliation.  Peter:    Hi Michelle, really interesting to hear your answers to the last questions. What sort of advice would you give to autistic people here in the UK who would like to get into research?  Michelle Dawson:  My main advice is--read a lot of papers! Find out what you're interested in and what you can do well. You need a lot of critical thinking and it helps to not decide ahead of time what you should find. I also suggest reading the scientific literature involving the typical population to get an idea of the often higher standards there--and then use these higher standards to interpret the autism literature.   It is hard for me to give advice at the usual levels because I haven't ever been to university as a student. Still I hope I've shown that even an uneducated autistic can be useful in research, given the opportunity.  Kate:   What do you think about the links between research and government policy? I think we struggle to get government to fund support and interventions for children partly because they're not convinced of the benefits. What should we do about that?  Michelle Dawson: The problem has been the poor quality of autism intervention research, resulting in arguments based on a few studies of questionable quality. In my view, the solution is to ensure that only good quality--as this is defined for the typical population--intervention research is funded.   We should at this point know much more than we do, about how to help and how not to harm autistics. We should have 10 or more large, well-designed, multi-site RCTs like the one  Jonathan Green has conducted in the UK . But we don't. So policy and so on is determined according to who is loudest and so on, rather than according to what might help autistics.  Joe:   If you had the power to fund one new area of research what would it be and why?  Michelle Dawson:  I've been asked that question many times in the UK and my answer is always that I would throw funding into Jonathan Green's work, simply because he is applying much higher standards to autistics in autism intervention research than has previously been the case.   This may seem like an odd choice, but the poor quality of the autism intervention literature is in my view a major problem that doesn't stay confined to how decisions are made about interventions, which is important enough in itself.   We don't know yet how far better quality research will go in making things better for autistics, and to what degree it will solve the problems so to speak, but it is something we must try. The effort to lower standards for autistics has been dominant and it is hard to imagine a better way to signal that autistics are worth less than nonautistics.   It is very fortunate that Jonathan Green and others, like Catherine Aldred,  have not gone along with this trend , and instead are viewing autistics as deserving of the same standards as everyone else. And we know that these standards work for autistics. So this is why I would send them more funding if I could.  Peter: How do we support more autistics to become leading academics / scientists rather than purely the subject of research? What needs to change and are there any examples of where you think this is working well?  Michelle Dawson:  First I think we have to stop discouraging autistics from being interested in research. I've been discouraged by pretty much every major advocacy group, for example, on every political \"side.\"   Also, there has been a tendency to segregate autistics from science as usual--of saying that science doesn't really work on autistics so we must have some special model or we must have autism-specific standards.   In my view, there is no evidence to support this longstanding trend--instead the problem has been that via advocacy, autistics have been segregated from the standards and so on that we know must exist to protect and benefit nonautistics.   So currently there is the idea that while autistics can participate in research, we can only do so under certain models, which are, for example, far too sophisticated and elaborate for me.   The group in Montreal seems to work well because there is no such elaborate model. We just do science, and this is something that some autistics are really good at. Autistics and nonautistics work together as equals and it is no big deal. There is no need to adhere to some elaborate ideological model about how autistics and academics should work together.  Jean-Paul:  Do you think autism researchers and autism advocates could and should worker closer together?  Michelle Dawson:   Since 1970 or before, advocacy (of various kinds) has been decisive in influencing the course of autism research. The question is whether this has been good for autistics. In many cases, I believe it hasn't been.   In part the responsibility lies on researchers who have used advocacy to prop up less than scientific (and less than ethical) views, theories, and practices.   I think it's very important that scientific and ethical standards not be lowered or discarded for autistics, and sadly there are a lot of demands via advocacy (from every direction) that this must happen.   I am really hoping for advocacy which demands higher standards of science and ethics for autistics, but this hasn't happened yet. Feel free to step in!  Sammi:     Do you think the politics of the autism community gets in the way of progress sometimes?  Michelle Dawson:  I think there is very strong evidence of how autism politics (on every \"side\") has harmed autistics.   The political process and political methods are important and they work, even if they look messy, but in autism they have dominated at the expense of scientific and ethical standards, and this has in my view harmed autistics, as it would for any other group.  There is more at the  link . The photo above was taken by Thomas Henderson on an iPad, also the one below, both in Manchester. A lot of London, including the taxis, looked familiar due to  Stephen Wiltshire's work . My experience in the UK was excellent. That was entirely due to those many who bravely welcomed and helped me out, who were extraordinarily forgiving of my many limitations, and who provided a lot of productive discussion. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-INU1H3gEP0E/T4cKefQrqEI/AAAAAAAAAUw/VtNDjz_rVlA/s1600/UK2012_manchester_monument.bmp", "http://www.talkaboutautism.org.uk/page/liveevents/michelledawson.cfm", "http://www.ioe.ac.uk/research/28033.html", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.ca/2010/08/making-autism-research-history.html", "http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42011001349", "http://www.talkaboutautism.org.uk/page/liveevents/michelledawson.cfm", "http://www.stephenwiltshire.co.uk/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jJ74w4rD34k/T4cSt9UmJEI/AAAAAAAAAU4/190zllennN0/s1600/UK2012_cabs.bmp"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2012/04/autistic-in-uk.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 09, 2012", "body": "\nIn a  commentary epublished in March , about savant syndrome in autism, Patricia Howlin wrote:  In 1887 Langdon Down was the first to coin the term \u2018idiot savant\u2019 Howlin and several co-authors, including Sir Michael Rutter, wrote in a  2009 paper : Down (1887) was the first to coin the term \u2018idiot savant\u2019 Here are Pam Heaton and Gregory Wallace from  a major 2004 review: The term \u2018idiot-savant\u2019 was first used by Down (1887) From  1999, Pam Heaton  again, as well as Linda Pring, Beate Hermelin, and others: The term \"Idiot-Savants\" was first used by Langdon Down in 1887 Darold Treffert, often described as the authority on savants, has written accounts along these lines:  However, the first specific description of savant syndrome took place in London in 1887 when Dr J. Langdon Down gave that year\u2019s prestigious Lettsomian Lecture at the invitation of the Medical Society of London... In 1887, \u2018idiot\u2019 was an accepted classification for persons with an IQ below 25, and \u2018savant\u2019, or \u2018knowledgeable person\u2019, was derived from the French word savoir meaning \u2018to know\u2019. Down joined those words together and coined the term idiot savant by which the condition was generally known over the next century. That's from  a 2009 paper . There seems to be an impressive consensus in the literature that Down coined the term \"idiot savant\" in 1887 ( here is the source cited in all of the above ), a claim that Treffert has made since the late 1980s, and many others have followed suit. So far as I can tell, this consensus is wrong. Edouard Seguin, who died in 1880, is well known for having written about savants. He wrote about the famous pianist Blind Tom Wiggins, for instance, in a  book published in 1866 . And in  a short 1870 paper , he is quoted as using the term \"idiot savant.\" Here it is (spelling from original):  Among the wealthier classes, idiocy is not only oftener aggravated by accessory diseases, but also complicated with abnormal semi-capacities or disordered instincts, which produce heterogeneous types to an almost unlimited extent. It is from this class, almost exclusively, that we have musical, mathematical, architectural, and other varieties of the  idiot savant;  the useless protrusion of a single faculty, accompanied by a woful general impotence. Seguin's use of \"idiot savant\" did not pass unnoticed in the literature. For example, in  the BMJ in 1875 , George W. Grabham quotes and takes issue with Seguin's views (spelling from the original):  A curious class may be termed that of the idiot \"savans\", in whom one or more faculties are amazingly developed, perhaps to the detriment of the rest. One has a marvellous power of acquiring languages and musical knowledge; another, great mechanical skill and original constructive ability; a third, though very childish, is no mean mental arithmetician; a fourth remembers all he reads; a fifth delights in dates; while a sixth can tell the time when awakened from sleep. General improvement has taken place in all these cases. Dr. Seguin, a well known authority on idiocy, has given the support of his pen to a theory \"that idiocy is found in its simplest forms among the labouring classes, and that, among the wealthier classes, it is not only oftener aggravated by accessory diseases, but also complicated with abnormal semi-capacities or disordered instincts, which produce heterogeneous types to an almost unlimited extent. It is from this class almost exclusively that we have musical, mathematical, architectural, and other varieties of the idiot savant; useless protrusion of a single faculty, accompanied by a woeful general impotence\". I am quite unable to agree with this view; my experience of many of these idiot \"savans\" proving them to have sprung from parents in humble circumstances, and leading me to believe them to have resulted in many instances from hereditary insanity. It's possible Seguin was not the first to use \"idiot savant\" but he does get this honor in  the online OED , which quotes Seguin's 1870 paper but does not mention or quote Langdon Down. In a footnote,  Spitz (1995)  provides a small trace of dissent, noting that Down himself made no claim, in 1887, to having coined \"idiot savant\" and indeed he seems to be using an existing term. Spitz did not try to find who did coin \"idiot savant,\" but you can't blame Down for the false consensus.  And it hardly matters, to current-day autistics, who exactly coined an obsolete term in the 1800s. Langdon Down and Edouard Seguin probably don't care about their  h-indexes . There are many vastly more important issues related to the term \"idiot savant\" and the human beings who were characterized this way, and the still-dominant view that strong autistic abilities are useless protrusions (recent example  here ).  But it does matter when telling an inaccurate story becomes the standard in the autism literature, over the course of 20 years or more. This is far from the only instance. And this is an especially easy story to verify (or not). References: HOWLIN, P. (2012).

{"date": "Tuesday, August 31, 2010", "body": "\n If you are autistic and ever venture  or are pushed  into public, a near-certainty is that you will publicly be ranked and classified by total strangers.  For example, you will be assigned to the \"high end\" or the \"low end\" of the autistic spectrum, according to whether you are claimed to have a good or bad outcome ( I've been claimed to have both ). Non-political observers may notice how ethically and scientifically problematic this is, but there are few discussions, formal or informal, in which autistics aren't automatically assigned \"high-functioning\" and \"low-functioning\" rankings as definitive and permanent aspects of ourselves: there are LFAs and then there are HFAs.  If the whole area of autism were not so politicized, it might have long been seen as important to check the scientific basis for these ubiquitous rankings. It might even be seen as an ethical obligation. It might be noticed that there is something wrong with discarding and therefore dishonouring the contributions to research made by the countless autistic children and adults who have been recruited as participants in autism research, and without whom there would be no autism research at all.  I've never been impressed by autism politics, on whatever \"side,\" so I'll start with some basic information about levels of functioning as reported in autism research, then provide several examples pulled from some of the  numerous papers  I've recently looked at.  What does level of functioning mean in autism research? In autism research, autistics' level of functioning is most often judged according to scores on specific tests of IQ (e.g., Wechsler) or developmental level (Mullen, Bayley, sometimes the Vineland) at a specific time.  The reported threshold dividing \"high\" from \"low\" functioning ranges from 50 to 90--at least in papers I've read so far; the actual range might be even greater. Those are IQ or IQ-type scores with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. So the threshold, the line dividing \"high\" from \"low\" functioning in autism research, is almost three SDs wide. Fall into that impressive span, and you may be high or you may be low functioning, depending on who you ask.  If 90 is the threshold, then about 25% of the entire population (autistic, nonautistic, everyone) is low-functioning. If the more common threshold of 85 is chosen, then about 16% of everyone is low-functioning.  70 is the threshold often considered to be standard even if in reality, if you read the literature, the threshold varies dramatically. But there are different tests and within commonly-used tests there are different ways to set a threshold, even when the threshold is numerically set at 70.  With this in mind, here are some examples. Example 1 In Farley et al. (2010) the threshold is indeed 70 and autistics with lower baseline (circa age 8yrs) IQs were excluded. As the authors write, \"all participants had baseline IQs in the nonimpaired range.\"  In fact the full-scale baseline IQs of autistics deemed to meet the 70 threshold, and included as participants, range down to 36. An IQ of 36 is near the current threshold for severe intellectual disability. An IQ of 36 (if you were under age ~4yrs) would exclude you from  Ivar Lovaas' famous ABA study --you are too low-functioning.  But in different circumstances, which are specified by Farley et al., a full-scale IQ of 36 can also be considered to grossly underestimate your abilities and to put you in a study of participants who would widely be ranked as high-functioning. Example 2 Klin et al. (2007) is another study where the autistic participants (ages 7-18yrs) are all considered high-functioning and the threshold is 70. In one of two samples, verbal, performance, and full-scale IQs run from 52 to 150. Then there are Vineland scores. While Vineland is a test of adaptive behavior, in autism research Vineland scores can also be used as measures of intelligence ergo level of functioning.  Vineland composite scores in this sample range down to 25. Two of the Vineland domain scores range down to 20. In  a recent population-based study  (ages 9-14yrs), an assigned Vineland score of 19 was used to represent profound intellectual disability. But in Klin et al., you can have a Vineland composite score of 25, or Vineland domain scores of 20, and you are high-functioning. You are in the same category as someone with a verbal IQ of 150. Example 3 In Akshoomoff et al. (2004), there is also a threshold of 70, but autistics falling on either side of this threshold are included then divided into lower and higher functioning groups. Performance IQ scores in the lower-functioning group range up to 128. That is not only higher than the individual scores of the entire higher-functioning group, it is higher than all but ~3% of the entire population. If a PIQ of 128 ranks you as low-functioning, as it does in Akshoomoff et al., then almost everyone is low-functioning. Example 4  In view of the above it might seem wise to abandon the 70 threshold and try something completely different. Annaz et al. (2009) created high-functioning and low-functioning autism groups (ages 5-11yrs) by incorrectly using the CARS (Childhood Autism Rating Scale), which is supposed to be a measure of autism \"severity.\" This study features two measures of intelligence, one verbal (British Picture Vocabulary Scale, a verbal IQ equivalent) and one non-verbal (a subtest from the British Ability Scales).  One result is that you can have a verbal IQ of 62 and be classified as high-functioning, and a verbal IQ of 111 and be classified as low-functioning.  The non-verbal measure is reported in age-equivalents only, but the two autistic groups are remarkably well-matched on age. And the mean non-verbal age equivalents are both (1) the same for the two autistic groups, and (2) very nearly the same as mean chronological age, again for the two autistic groups.  In other words, another result is that both high- and low-functioning autistics here represent groups whose mean measured non-verbal intelligence is the same as the general population mean, and of course vice-versa. Setting aside possible differences in distribution, now everyone is both high- and low-functioning. Conditional examples 5 and 6  This is a bit of a digression, but if you adhere to the common political or ideological prejudice that \"Kanner's autism\" is \"classical autism\" is \"low-functioning autism\" you are then required to achieve an IQ of over 140 ( from Kanner's original 11 ) or 150 ( from Kanner's 1956 follow-up ) to be ranked as high-functioning. That means you have to be better than the 99th percentile.    Now what? The above doesn't nearly convey the arbitrariness in the existing autism literature. As I wrote, I've provided just a bunch of examples, among many others, you will find if you read a lot of papers. Also, I've left out entire major areas, like changes over time and results from deliberate comparisons between different tests of intelligence.  While this was not intentional, the examples above might be construed as exploiting the atypically high variability characterizing individual autistics and in addition characterizing autistics as a group. Then the question is whether it serves the interests of autistics, and whether it advances autism research, to diminish, misrepresent, trivialize, denigrate, obscure, or deny this characteristic variability.  And as usual, the above can be verified by reading the existing autism literature. If there are any factual errors, as is always possible, please let me know.   Futher reading  The late Ivar Lovaas expressed his views about levels of functioning in autism in one of the major ABA manuals; this is quoted  here . From a different point of view,  this article  concisely applies ethical consideration to the issue of level of functioning, among others. In autism politics, the dimension of autism \"severity\" and the different dimension of \"level of functioning\" are often wrongly confused or conflated. You can find science-based information about autism \"severity\"  here  and  here .  References: Akshoomoff N, Lord C, Lincoln AJ, Courchesne RY, Carper RA, Townsend J, & Courchesne E (2004).

{"date": "Monday, January 03, 2011", "body": "\n In  one short paper , Elizabeth Pellicano and colleagues claim to demolish Simon Baron Cohen's  systemizing account of autism . They also conclude that autistics' strong visual search and  probabilistic   learning   abilities  fail in large-scale space, ergo in the real world.  The  press release  starts by declaring that autistic children \"lack visual skills required for independence\" and does not exaggerate the claims in the paper, which merit a lot of scrutiny. So bear with me, this is not going to be short. First what they did (and didn't do), then what they found, then what it means. 1. What did they do? And what didn't they do? Pellicano et al.'s purpose was to assess systemizing in autism by testing autistic visual search abilities in true-to-life large-scale space. And this research group has the set-up for it--a  room-size visual search task . Except they ignored this possibility, instead choosing what they themselves call a test of \" non-visually guided foraging .\"  In other words, Pellicano et al. do not include visual search tasks at any scale, so you can't draw conclusions from their paper about visual search abilities in autism.  From Figure 1, here is what Pellicano et al.'s foraging task looked like: It took place in a 4m by 4m space arranged as shown. In two 20-trial blocks, 20 autistic and 20 nonautistic children (age ~11yrs) had to find which of 16 green floor lights, eight on each side of a midline, turned red when pressed. The children were not told that 80% of the concealed red targets were on one side of the room (\"rich\" side) with only 20% on the other (\"sparse\" side). The task instruction was to find the red target as quickly as possible.  But search all you like, in this paper you will find no data about how quickly the participants found the targets. The researchers left out this available measure. They left out number of green lights hit before finding the red target. They left out how many first touches were on the \"rich\" vs \"sparse\" sides of the room.  They left out almost every measure they previously deemed important to assess performance on foraging tasks in large-scale space (e.g.  here ,  here ,  here ). They seem also to overlook their previous systemizing-relevant (you would think) finding of no male-female difference in performance on the same foraging task (experiment 2  here ).  Another of their own  previous findings  is that children's foraging performance is related to their performance on the Corsi block task, a measure of spatial memory. Autistic children don't necessarily show a deficit on this task (e.g.  here ), but in Pellicano et al., they did. If the goal wasn't simply to assess spatial memory, why not match groups on this ability?  2. What did they find? Their main measure was sensitivity to probability in the foraging task which,  ignoring their previous work , they defined as percent of visits to the rich side of the room. Here the authors report \"no overall effect of group,\" never mind media reports ( here is one ). There was an effect for the first block of trials, where autistics visited the rich side for 45.50% of their touches vs 61.50% for nonautistics. In the 2nd block, the figures were 62.25% and 63.25%.  Two additional novel foraging measures involved total length of paths to the red target, per floor distance between green lights. These were assessed with highly sophisticated but conspicuously small-scale methods suited to eye-scanning and/or non-foraging pencil-and-paper tasks. So it doesn't matter how much time you take, or how much you have to twist and turn, or how many green lights you have to reach for. All that matters is length of path, and at this level the autistic children were judged significantly (a) less optimal and (b) less repetitive. Because you should ask, according to Pellicano et al.,  less repetitive  means less systematic ergo is now yet another autistic deficit.   The final foraging measure was total revisits to green lights, where the autistics had significantly more in the second but not the first block. One autistic child racked up a big chunk of the autistic revisits (more than 3 SDs above the group mean), which might indicate an atypical understanding of or interest in aspects of the task. There is no information about group differences minus the interesting outlier.  The two non-foraging measures were the Corsi task where autistic children had a significant disadvantage, and an embedded figures task on which they performed significantly better than their controls (yes, interpreted as a global deficit, without evidence for same). Revisits--outlier included--correlated with the non-foraging measures in the autistic group. There is no information about these correlations for the nonautistic children or about any other correlations. 3. What does it mean?  Well first, it's an interesting task, even if it's not a visual search task.  But even if autistics totally failed (they didn't, and search all you want again, but you will find no rationale in this paper for the drop-off-a-cliff thresholds pushed by the authors), this task doesn't map easily onto the authors' sensational claims. These include that autistics can't find  \"shoes in the bedroom, apples in a supermarket, or a favourite animal at the zoo\"  ergo can't achieve independence.  Of course I want a whole lot more data, or an excellent rationale (none is provided) for not reporting most of it. And numerous possibilities were overlooked.  There's those other regularities in the distribution of red targets. There were only 40 trials, and each green light position was the target at least once. On the \"sparse\" side, each position would be the target exactly once (8 targets, 8 positions). The participants were not supposed to notice or be affected by this kind of regularity. No one knows how autistics would have performed if given accurate task instructions (to take the shortest path, as measured by the authors, to the target). Maybe someone else can bring up motor differences, which plausibly are relevant to this \"true-to-life\" task. And I wonder how clear, for autistics, the task instructions were with respect to revisits. Autistics should be notorious by now for noticing aspects of tasks that nonautistics don't ( fantastic example at IMFAR last year ), and for exploring more possibilities than nonautistics (examples  here  and  here ). Writing this off as a bad thing, as autistics being lost in space or some dire equivalent, is shortsighted to say the least.  If you're paying attention, autistics' \"less repetitive\" and speculatively more exploratory behavior--more aspects of the array are interesting to autistics, more possibilities and probabilities are explored--in \"large-scale\" space is a predictable finding. There is no reason to trash as useless (or harmful, and Pellicano et al. go there) multiple replications of excellent autistic visual search and probabilistic learning performance. One genuine conclusion is that systemizing, as conceived by Pellicano et al., and  also by Baron-Cohen , is too rigid and limited a model to encompass how autistics atypically detect and explore environmental regularities.

{"date": "Wednesday, August 18, 2010", "body": "\n Some months ago, Jonathan Green and his colleagues simultaneously published ( in the  Lancet ) and presented ( at IMFAR 2010 ) their multi-site RCT of an early autism intervention. In conducting and reporting the Preschool Autism Communication Trial, they have made autism research history. They have done so simply by applying to autistics scientific standards that are  well-established in non-autism non-ABA areas . The upshot is an autism early intervention trial whose results are worth serious consideration and which is unprecedented in this respect.  Via the  PACT website , you can find the  Lancet  paper reporting the PACT RCT, the peer-reviewed PACT intervention \"manual\" (which refers to another, more detailed manual), the PACT RCT protocols, references for related papers including a 2004 pilot RCT, a list of investigators and funders, and so on.  I've previously written about the PACT as an  anomaly in autism intervention research . The PACT entails an early autism intervention that was not widely promoted as effective or essential before it was fairly tested. That is a first in the history of autism research. It may also be the largest RCT of any kind of autism intervention ever published (if I'm wrong, I'm sure someone will tell me).  In short the PACT RCT is an internationally-registered multi-site trial of a manualized intervention targeting the parents of preschool (ages 2-5yrs) autistic children. The PACT intervention spans one year and involves 12 twice-monthly 2hr clinic-based sessions followed by 6 monthly sessions. Parents are expected to apply what they learn, in interacting with their autistic child, for half an hour per day.  For the PACT RCT, 152 children who met criteria for the specific diagnosis of autism were randomly assigned to receive either the PACT intervention plus treatment as usual or TAU alone. PACT and TAU children were well-matched at intake across several measures, and finished well-matched in other treatments received. Parents were not as well-matched. A detailed description of the PACT intervention is  here .  Dr Green and colleagues were successful both in recruiting an unprecedentedly large number of preschool autistic children for an RCT--in fact, expectations for recruitment were exceeded--and in minimizing drop-outs. In the  Lancet , you will find an outstandingly clear CONSORT flowchart of participants as well as an intention to treat analysis and mixed results.  Results favouring the PACT group were mainly in the area of parent-child interaction, as assessed through videos. The PACT group also outperformed the TAU children in parent-reported vocabulary and social measures, results carefully downplayed by Green et al. due to the parents not being blinded to intervention status. Post-treatment-only measures of adaptive behaviour reported by teachers did not differ between groups.   The main measure was the ADOS used as a scale, and here too there was no result. In my view, using the ADOS as the main measure is a major error but an informative one. The ADOS, as used here (awkward tweaks and all), has thresholds only and doesn't work like a scale. And where is the evidence that lower ADOS scores in very young autistic children in themselves lead to better eventual outcomes? On the other hand, the strong design of the PACT RCT is such that it calls into question  what exactly the ADOS is assessing --a result which deserves a lot of attention. Using ADOS thresholds, 27% of the 146 children who completed their assigned treatment had migrated from the specific diagnosis of autism to the lower-threshold \"ASD\" category, while an additional 6% no longer met criteria for any autistic spectrum diagnosis. No group differences were found. These findings lend perspective to the  widely-publicized diagnostic category results  from another  recent RCT  involving a small sample of much younger children receiving more than two years of intervention. As with all studies, it's possible to list a range of flaws, potential concerns, and caveats. The ADOS is not only wrongly used as a measure, it is incorrectly used to stratify the sample for randomization. The ADI-R is used in a slightly unconventional way, possibly to accommodate children who otherwise would be excluded by its limitations. There was no screening ergo no exclusion for genetic syndromes, which arguably makes the findings more difficult to interpret. There was poor agreement between raters for two of the three parent-child interaction measures, which in my view is fascinating and telling: nonautistic raters are not good at agreeing about what child initiation and shared attention consist of, when a child is autistic. If you look at the  Lancet  paper, depending on how your brain works, you should rapidly find at least one minor error in the data (I can't help it...).  The PACT intervention itself has questionable aspects. The fundamental idea is sound: train parents to better respond to their autistic children's communication. But the PACT is a rigidly developmental six-step approach based on how nonautistics develop. In addition, and  like so many other autism interventions , the PACT imposes extreme rationing of information and materials. Everything is cleared and shut away except a few toys or items. Anything in which autistics regardless manage to show strong interest will be taken away and replaced with something less interesting. What this does to an autistic child's communication  and learning  is not considered. The PACT explicitly requires every effort to identify and cater to the parents' different ways of learning, but no such consideration is extended to the autistic children.  The above is a not-close-to-complete list of the PACT's strengths, many of them unique, and its weaknesses--which due to its strengths serve as important information for the future of autism intervention research. Because the trial is so strongly designed compared to the rest of the literature, it is that much more important to learn from and build on. This may not serve the interests of various lobby groups or service providers or political leaders or advocates, but it will serve the interests of autistics. Here is a suggestion from Dr Green and colleagues in the  Lancet : These findings suggest that the optimistic results from other studies should be reassessed. Yes--good experimental design means that you risk  not having your biases confirmed . But taking this risk is currently the only demonstrated way to fairly test interventions and treatments, and for this reason, the only way to conduct ethical research.  There is a  Lancet   editorial about the PACT RCT , written by two NIH scientists. Here is one thing they point out: Thus, in a field in which minimum study standards have made it difficult to even look for literature to answer what works for autism, this study is an achievement. Here is another, and they get the last word: This study furthers the field by setting a new bar for the minimum standards of rigorous methodology needed in trials that have potentially far-reaching service and policy implications.

{"date": "Sunday, October 10, 2010", "body": "\n Associations between autism and notorious violent crimes are easy to find--they seem almost automatic.  Here is one example ,  and another , and  one more . There seems to be an  entire book on this theme , though I haven't read it. In the scientific literature, you can find powerful deficit models of autism at work in predictions that autistics should disproportionately be violent and prone to criminal behavior. For decades now, examples and claims (just a few  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ) fitting this prediction have been highlighted, while the few dissenting views (e.g.  here  and  here ) have had little effect. Then there's political expedience. Unless we receive the usual lobbied-for interventions, autistics will disproportionately display criminal behavior and wind up in jail--or so it is claimed. A few examples from the usual autism politics  here ,  here ,  here . Kathrin Hippler and her colleagues deserve high praise for noticing how well-placed they were to investigate these kinds of popular claims. Their recent paper takes advantage of their access to information about the large group of individuals--177 of them--who are former patients from Hans Asperger's clinical practice in Vienna. Most (93%) of these former patients are male. All were assumed to score at least in the normal range of intelligence as children, but for most there are no recorded IQ scores. They were born between 1938 and 1979, and on average were diagnosed at age eight (range 3-21 years). In 2010 their average age would be about 50. It is unlikely that most of this cohort would have undergone the usual lobbied-for autism interventions as children. Hippler et al. obtained information from the Austrian Penal Register about all criminal convictions registered, as of 2002, in this cohort. They found 33 convictions for a total of 8 individuals, resulting in 23 \"custodial sentences\" ranging from 2-30 months and 11 fines. They also checked whether, compared to the general population, their cohort had a higher rate of newly-registered convictions for the years 1998-2002. Here is what they found: the average proportion of convictions found in our sample (1.30%) is very comparable to that in the general male population (1.25%) As to kinds of crimes: By far the most common convictions in Asperger\u2019s former patients were for property offences [...] Offences against life and physical integrity were rare. And while data for the general population were limited: qualitative assessment of offence types in Asperger\u2019s former patients suggests that they do not differ radically from those in the general public Because this point needs to be underlined, here is more from Hippler et al.'s discussion: the findings from our study do not suggest an over-representation of certain offence types. In the case records spanning 22 years and 33 convictions, there were only three cases of bodily injury, one case of robbery and one case of violent and threatening behaviour. Again to their great credit, Hippler et al. also provide data broken down according to Asperger's system of diagnosis. The 177 former patients were divided into an AP group (\"autistic psychopathology,\" N = 73) and an AF group (\"features of autistic psychopathology,\" N = 104).   Some guesswork is involved, but the AP group would fall under current criteria either for Asperger syndrome or the specific diagnosis of autism. Hippler et al. conservatively estimate one-third would be specific-autistic, but it's not difficult to find researchers who would guess a higher proportion ( here, for example ). While a minority of the AF group might meet Asperger syndrome criteria, according to Hippler et al., others might be PDD-NOS, or in the (nonautistic) broader autistic phenotype. The AFs are described as \"former patients at the less extreme end of the spectrum\" and were included by Hippler et al. because: Asperger believed that \u2018autistic psychopathy\u2019 was a heritable condition blending into \"normality\", which is reflected in the case descriptions of these children in the sense that the core features were the same but symptoms were less severe or could be compensated for better. According to  near-universal assumptions , it would be far better to be AF (less \"severe\" or \"extreme\") than AP. Transforming AP-types into AF-types is a major goal of the usual lobbied-for autism interventions. But Hippler et al. found that most of the registered criminal convictions in their cohort belonged not to the \"more autistic\" AP group but to the \"less autistic or not autistic at all\" AF group.  Indeed, of the 33 convictions found registered as of 2002, only three convictions of two individuals were found in the AP group. The remaining 30 belong to six individuals in the AF group, with two in this group contributing 22 convictions.  In the comparison with rates of newly-registered convictions in the general population, the AP rate was 0.6% while the AF rate was 1.7%. These figures are lower and higher, respectively, than for the general male population, while the AP rate is comparable to the general population, females included (0.7%). Hippler et al. provide a competent overview of the relevant literature (including  this recent finding ), as well as a fair discussion of their study's limitations. Under the banner \"Wider Implications,\" they write: There is a public perception that individuals with mental health diagnoses in general, and Asperger\u2019s syndrome in particular, present a threat to the general public. We contend that, based on the follow-up data from Asperger\u2019s original cohort, as well as other studies, this perception is wrong. Even wider implications include the neglected question of how being regarded as just naturally violent and dangerous to others, as natural born criminals,  has affected the outcomes of autistics .

{"date": "Monday, May 17, 2010", "body": "\n I had no idea my sleep-wake cycle was pathological until I saw a presentation a few years ago by the geneticist Thomas Bourgeron. One of his interests is clock genes in autism. In fact only by speaking with him did it dawn on me that I lack a circadian rhythm. As it turns out, autistics are considered to have  circadian clocks \"gone bad.\"  Two reviews (Bourgeron, 2007; Glickman, 2010) cover the evidence with respect to autism and circadian rhythms, most of it in the direction of comprehensive atypicalities. Glickman (2010) summarizes the problem:  Disturbed sleep-wake patterns and abnormal hormone profiles in children with autism suggest an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system. And autistic children's bad timing, when it comes to sleeping and waking, is considered disruptive or worse, both to themselves and their sleep-deprived families. Bourgeron (2007) raises the further concern that typical sleep-wake patterns are essential for \"appropriate\" development, for the functioning of memory, and so on. Apparently there is nothing good about autistics' bad circadian clocks.   Autistics whose sleep-wake cycles carry on independently from environmental and social cues are said to be \"freerunning.\" My form of freerunning is extreme. I can sleep whenever I want--a few hours here, twelve hours there, as necessary, no matter the time of day or night. I enjoy sunlight but its absence has no effect on my mood, or on my sleep. I can work through nights, no problem, and shift to days in a blink. I've never suffered through jet lag. And so on. Until I ran into Bourgeron I had no idea this was considered pathological, at least in an autistic.  The usual response to freerunning in autism is to see this as an autism-related sleep disorder. There is very preliminary evidence that freerunning autistics can be successfully treated with melatonin. Bourgeron (2007) refers to a  short case study  about an autistic whose free-running was remediated by melatonin treatment.  Of course nonautistics take melatonin too. They put themselves through sleep hygiene routines and they go to  sleep clinics  in droves. They suffer terribly from shift work and jet lag, and inadequate efforts to eradicate this suffering are everywhere, from  new drugs  to  new iPhone apps .  There is an enormous market for products and services that can treat individuals who stray from the proper expected sleep-wake cycle. Remarkably, the goal is never to free people from their circadian prisons but to  return them there and keep them there . The schedule may be changed, with effort, but the prison remains the same.  The next time I spoke with Bourgeron, I told him there should be a sort of anti-melatonin which would allow people to freerun like me, ergo avoiding the ills of jet lag, shift work, and what-all. It seems possible no one has seriously thought of this.  I suggested the anti-melatonin idea to some nonautistic colleagues. They burst into stories about destroyed careers, disrupted lives. In constrast with autistics like me, my colleagues have perfectly \"good\" circadian clocks--which turn out to be incompatible with their challenging lives. They suffered, for being normally chained to their normal circadian rhythms.  If there was a pill that could give them my very dysfunctional clock so they could freerun to the extreme, they would buy it in bulk. But there isn't. Instead there is the assumption that everyone has to live in a circadian prison. Glickman (2010) speculates that some autistics' failure to chain our sleep-wake cycles to environmental cues (you can find information about entrainment, as this process is called,  here ) may arise from our atypical perception. My totally wild guess might be that an extreme freerunning phenotype in autism may be contributed to in part by  cognitive versatility  in autism, which would result in perceived environmental cues affecting sleep-wake cycles in an  optional rather than mandatory way .  The renowned Bora Zivkovic , who unlike me knows all about circadian clocks,  recently wrote  that--unlike me--typical people have \"have complex circadian systems that are easy to get out of whack\" with dire consequences: In the state of almost permanent jet-lag that many of us live in, a lot of things go wrong. We get sleeping disorders, eating disorders, obesity, compromised immunity leading to cancer, problems with reproduction, increase in psychiatric problems, the Seasonal Affective Disorder, prevalence of stomach ulcers and breast cancer in night-shift nurses, etc. BoraZ was writing enviously about reindeer who live with drastic changes of season yet have escaped this kind of misery, possibly by having a \"low-amplitude\" clock. They just stroll out of their circadian prisons, whenever it's adapative. How can poor suffering human beings do this, is the question--finally. It's a very good question.  References: Bourgeron, T.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 17, 2010", "body": "\n The widespread message arising from  Andari et al. (in press)  is that the hormone oxytocin \" may be a powerful weapon in fighting autism \" or words to that effect.  The heart of this study is a computer game version of catch which appears to involve four human players. When a player is thrown the ball, he must then throw it to another player of his choice. Every time a player receives the ball, he receives a bit of money. In Andari et al. (in press), small groups of autistic and nonautistic adults (\"P\") individually play this game with three strangers (\"A\" \"B\" \"C\"). Much is done to persuade the autistic and nonautistic participants that the strangers, who in fact are elaborately programmed, are actual, present, proximate (in adjacent booths), decision-making human beings.  The three strangers start by equally distributing the ball to the other players. Then the elaborate program kicks in: A and C increasingly favour one player (P and B, respectively) while shunning the others. B's behaviour does not change. In a prototypical display of us-vs-them thinking, the nonautistic Ps responded by ganging up with A to reap the social and monetary gains of a close alliance founded on the exclusion of half the players.  The autistic Ps in contrast displayed no such selfish and discriminatory behaviour. They continued to throw the ball to the other players in equal proportion, ignoring their self-interest in favour of keeping all players equally included.  Further, subjective ratings of the other players revealed that the autistic Ps did not have the kinds of biases that are routinely called hypocrisy. They did not judge C, who shared the most with B, as worse or less trustworthy than A, who shared the most with themselves.  According to Andari et al. (in press), autistics \"cannot understand or engage in social situations,\" as evidenced by autistics' outstandingly altruistic performance in this game. It is this profound social deficit, this altruistic autistic behaviour, that was targeted for treatment.  And indeed, the treatment was successful. Autistics randomly administered a nasal mist containing oxytocin, rather than a saline placebo, significantly improved. They became willing to work with one of the players in an effort to shun and discriminate against the other two, and thereby get more than their fair share of money and attention. They became willing to see the player who shared with them as good and trustworthy, and the player who shared with someone else as bad and untrustworthy. They learned and displayed selfishness and hypocrisy and us-vs-them thinking. Their objectivity, fairness, and altruism were--temporarily--cured.  Then this finding was replicated in a second small group of autistic adults who performed the same task but without monetary rewards.  Success! Cue the avalanche of blogging and media stories.  Uta Frith says , \"This could be revolutionary.\" There is more to Andari et al. (in press), which also reports on two tasks involving face images, about which a few quick notes: 1. There is little ecological evidence that autistics avoid face images or do not make eye contact with face images.  2. Numerous other studies (a few examples  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ) which feature stronger designs (e.g., use of fixation crosses) have found typical duration and distribution of visual fixations to human face images, and/or typical attention to the eye area, in autistics.  3. For the nonautistic participants, the reported total visual fixation time to the face images--the crucial measure--well exceeds the total exposure time (both tasks), which has me, for one, scratching my head.  4. As yet there is no evidence that the reported oxytocin-related measured changes in visual fixation times to face images would overall be more beneficial than harmful to autistics.  5. In other studies (examples  here  and  here ) faster saccades and shorter visual fixation times, presumed by Andari et al. (in press) to be a very bad thing, have been associated with enhanced performance in autistics.  All this too is telling in its way, but it cannot equal the reported spectacular findings with respect to autism and altruism. In this respect Andari et al. (in press), even with its obvious limitations in design, is an enormously valuable paper. It has much to reveal about how autistics are regarded, and about the nature and consequences of the fight against autism.  For more about us-vs-them thinking in autistics and nonautistics, I recommend  Tyler Cowen's  prescient book,  Create Your Own Economy , as well as  this related video .  Interpretations of Andari et al. (in press) which in no way resemble the above can be found  here ,  here , and  here .

{"date": "Friday, February 12, 2010", "body": "\n We have to wait, patiently, for the DSM-V people to cough up their system for  ranking and classifying all autistics  according autism \"severity.\" In the meantime, some recently reported data are worth mulling over.  First,  here  is the most recent unofficial DSM-V autism \"severity\" ranking-system proposal, and  here  is my response, including information about instruments commonly claimed to measure autism \"severity.\" The current official DSM-V void in this area can be located  here .  An increasingly prominent measure of autism \"severity\" is the Social Responsiveness Scale.  Developed by John Constantino , it now exists in different age-range versions. Its purpose encompasses quantifying what are presumed to be autistic traits, from none on up, across the full range of humanity.  The SRS is a 65-item questionaire most often filled out by parents or teachers, whose ratings classify children according to \" severity of autistic symptomology .\" Higher scores, above an established threshold, indicate greater autism \"severity,\" and are therefore considered worse.  In a recently epublished high-profile paper (Roberts et al., in press), SRS scores were reported for 25 autistic children who were recruited then divided into two groups according to performance on a popular test of language abilities.  The children were about 10 years old. Sixteen autistic children classified as non-language-impaired achieved an average language ability score of ~100, right at the mean for the administered test. In contrast, nine autistic children classified as language-impaired scored ~65, more than two standard deviations lower.  I'm going to ignore the main purpose of this  interesting  study, which used magnetoencephalography to compare auditory evoked responses in autistics and nonautistics. Instead I'll concentrate on how this divided sample of autistic children was characterized.  Apart from language scores, the authors reported what could be considered verbal and performance intelligence, as per indexes from the latest child version of the Wechsler scales. Here the non-language-impaired autistic children scored significantly higher, with ~20-point and ~16-point advantages, respectively, over the language-impaired autistic group.  As I wrote above, Roberts et al. (in press) also reported SRS scores, described here as \"dimensional symptom severity ratings.\" SRS raw scores are commonly used in research, but the SRS has also been standardized, providing T-scores which account for variables such as gender and differences between raters (e.g. parents vs teachers). T-scores are standard scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.  While the SRS is not yet considered a diagnostic instrument, a T-score of 60, one SD above the mean, is currently the SRS-based cut-off for an autistic spectrum diagnosis. Standard scores from 60 to 75 currently indicate SRS-based \"mild to moderate\" autism; 76 or higher is the SRS-based \"severe\" autism range.  As might be predicted, the two autistic groups in Roberts et al. (in press) differed significantly on SRS T-scores; that is, they differed on autism \"severity.\" One group scored on average 70.89, falling into the \"mild to moderate\" range. The other scored 81.44, a full standard deviation higher, and crossed the threshold into \"severe\" autism.  As wouldn't be predicted at all, the non-language-impaired autistics, who had advantages not only in language but on measures of intelligence, were the \"severe\" autistics, while the language-impaired children were the \"mild to moderate\" ones.  My wild guess is that if an autism intervention was shown in fair tests to consistently produce a reduction in SRS scores of a full standard deviation, and what's more, transported  groups--however small--of autistic children from the \"severe\" to the \"mild to moderate\" SRS range, this would be considered tremendous progress.  The sample of autistic children in Roberts et al. (in press) is of course very small, as is charateristic of the bulk of the autism literature, and much can happen within such small sample. But these data  aren't inconsistent with numerous other existing reports , and deserve at least a look while we wait, patiently, for the DSM-V people to proclaim on autism \"severity.\"  You can find an uncritical short blurb about the SRS, which used to be called the \"Social Reciprocity Scale,\"  here , and a more extensive, critical description  here . Many thanks to Jennifer Stevenson for (patiently) answering my questions about the SRS. Any factual errors are entirely mine and should you find any, you should alert me immediately.

{"date": "Thursday, December 31, 2009", "body": "\n \" Autism rate in children has doubled, say doctors \" ... \" Autism 'more common than thought' \" ... \" Autism in children '10 times higher' than first thought \" ... \" Autism at a record high \" ... \" autism is 25 times more common than what researchers thought \"...  This mess of headlines and claims was generated in response to one autism prevalence study, Baird et al. (2006), published in the Lancet.  All 56,946 individuals comprising the targeted population cohort in this study are, as of today, the last day in the decade, 18 years of age or older. They were born between July 1, 1990 and Dec 31, 1991 and they are now all adults.  Within this cohort, Baird et al. (2006) reported an autistic spectrum prevalence of ~116/10,000. That's 1 in 86, and all these autistics, originally assessed as such when 9 to 14yrs old, are now adults.  For those to whom this is a matter of pressing importance, Asperger's contributed exactly nothing to that prevalence figure. So none of those 1 in 86 assessed-as-autistic now-adults are, at least according to Baird et al. (2006), Asperger's. I've previously  rattled   on  about Baird et al. (2006), one of the most important autism epidemiological studies to be published to date, and one of the most misrepresented. The authors found that small differences in case definition produced prevalence figures ranging from ~25/10,000 (1 in 400) to ~116/10,000 (1 in 86), a 4.6-fold discrepancy--within the same cohort at the same time, using the same diagnostic criteria, diagnostic team, and \"gold standard\" diagnostic instruments.  In the context of an earlier closely related prevalence study (Baird et al., 2000), the authors additionally found that a change in case ascertainment method  doubled autistic spectrum prevalence within very nearly the same cohort , even when diagnostic standards were equivalent.  But such provocative and crucial findings, and others similar, were lost in the predictably incoherent uproar (see representative headlines and quotes, above) over that one figure--the 1 in 86 who as of today are all adults. I suggest that if Baird et al. (2006) had been conducted in exactly the same manner with a cohort born five years earlier, the findings would not be much different. Or ten years earlier, or more, were that possible. Of course that's a wild guess, but not an entirely unfounded one.  Earlier this year,  a small innovative UK study  reported a prevalence of about 1 in 100 for autistics aged 16 and up--for autistic adults right up to and over age 75. There are only bad reasons for why this small study of autistic adults is unique and unprecedented.  The world would look very different now, for both autistics and nonautistics, if over the past decade or more there had been a rational discourse about autism prevalence  in which the existence of older autistics  was not automatically denied.

{"date": "Sunday, February 07, 2010", "body": "\n Early autism intervention research carries consequences for all autistics, and for a lot of nonautistics as well.  DawsonG et al. (2010)  is a newly-published randomized controlled trial of a newly-developed manualized very early autism intervention and as such deserves a close look. Developed by Sally Rogers and Geraldine Dawson, the Early Start Denver Model has been the subject of a handful of previous papers, none involving anything approaching a major trial. ESDM is reported to combine the Denver Model with Pivotal Response Training, two interventions developed in the 1980s which individually lack good quality evidence for their benefits or harms. If you are interested in ESDM and its possible fall-out, I suggest reading the existing DM, PRT, and ESDM literatures.  A book chapter, possibly written circa 2006, describes the ESDM RCT, apparently before all the results were in (SmithM et al., 2008), and is essential reading, as is the riveting recently-published ESDM manual (Rogers & DawsonG, 2010). My first exposure to the foundations of ESDM was a 2003 presentation by Sally Rogers. She showed a video of an adult picking up two blocks and banging them together and putting them down. In response a very young nonautistic child automatically picked up the blocks, banged them together, and put them down. A very young autistic child immediately noticed that the blocks were very interesting-shaped (and really they were--these were incredibly interesting blocks), picked them up, and inspected them closely seeing as they were so darn interesting.  You can guess which child's response was deemed wonderful and praiseworthy and \"right,\" and which child's response was deemed defective and unfortunate and totally wrong. With this in mind, here are some comments: About the ESDM 1. According to current definitions, ESDM is an \"eclectic\" autism intervention, combining ABA-based with non-ABA-based approaches. The manual specifies that ESDM \"most closely resembles\" RDI, DIR/Floortime, Hanen, responsiveness training, and SCERTS. ESDM also \"has clear ties to\" PRT, incidental teaching, and milieu teaching. And ESDM \"has in common\" some elements of ABA-based interventions as per Lovaas. Speech and occupational therapy are also thrown in. PROMPT too. The wide range of intervention approaches constantly available to children receiving ESDM is emphasized in all its available descriptions.  2. On principle and on the basis of small poor-quality trials, major behaviour analysts have claimed that \"eclectic\" autism interventions are ineffective; two recent examples  here  and  here . The Association of Professional Behavior Analysts has thoroughly  condemned \"eclectic\" approaches to autism , to uncritical applause by the Association for Behavior Analysis International's  autism special interest group .  3. The reported overarching theoretical basis for ESDM is a  1985 book  by the well-known  psychoanalyst, Daniel Stern . Other  psychoanalytic influences  have been reported for the  DM component of ESDM .  4. ESDM is further premised on autism being (from the manual) \"at its heart a social disorder.\" Autistics' profound (entirely one-sided) failures in displaying proper interpersonal relationships and proper social motivation produce a cascade of purely negative effects disrupting all areas of proper development and learning.  5. The ESDM goal: autistics must become as \"normal\" (from the manual) as possible. Every waking hour, autistics must work towards the one ESDM-recognized proper way to relate, learn, play, develop, etc.  6. Autistics' tendency to learn in atypical ways is treated as though disordered and harmful--as evidence for our primary social deficits, which in turn deny us all the proper, typical \"crucial learning experiences\" (e.g., \"birthday party games!\"--from the ESDM manual).  7. The only proper ESDM way to learn is through typical interpersonal interaction involving proper, typical use of developmentally-proper highly-rationed highly-controlled materials which must only be regarded and manipulated by the child in the one proper socially-related ESDM manner.  8. Keeping information away from autistic children who are persistently at risk of learning from it in non-ESDM-approved ways is a theme throughout the ESDM manual. While it is claimed that ESDM does not require a therapy room, in fact there are many instructions as to how such a room should be set up. This is representative: \"Ideally the room should be able to be arranged with nothing in it except a table and chairs and a closed or covered cabinet or shelves.\" This is called \"the natural environment.\" 9. While a great advantage of ESDM is reported to be that it is \"fun to do!\" in fact the manual sternly declares, when contemplating autistics who may enjoy learning in the wrong non-ESDM way: \"Our job is not to keep children happy; it is to teach them their objectives.\" And that very limited hierarchical range of objectives must be rigidly achieved in the one rigid proper manner and the one rigid proper order.  About the design of the ESDM RCT (DawsonG et al., 2010) 1. The trial spanned 2003-2008 and was  registered more than a year after it started . Many of the reported planned measures (see SmithM et al., 2008), particularly those related to brain activity, go unmentioned in DawsonG et al. (2010).  2. Basic description: 48 autistic children within the age range of 18 to 30 months (actual range is not reported) were randomized to two groups, to recieve either a minimum of 2yrs of ESDM or of services available in the community. Children were evaluated with four main measures (Mullen, Vineland, ADOS, a scale of repetitive behaviours) and according to their diagnostic status, after about one then two years. At the two-year evaluation, children had received an average of 29 months of intervention. Children had to be at least 48 months at the 2-year evaluation; therefore children younger at intake received more intervention than children older at intake. 3. Numerous and strict, but not atypical, exclusion criteria were applied. For example, children considered to fall into the \"severe\" and \"profound\" ranges of intellectual disability were excluded, as has been done in many popularly-cited ABA controlled trials.  4. In this trial at least, the ESDM is not an intensive intervention. The authors aimed for 20hrs/wk, but achieved only 15.2 (standard deviation 1.4), which falls into the range of low intensity  as currently defined .  5. Parents were expected to apply ESDM principles for an additional 5hrs/wk, but in fact reported (how accurately is unclear) more than triple this amount, indicating great enthusiasm and high expectations. ESDM parents also reported using non-ESDM services for about 5hrs/wk.  6. By the rock-bottom standards of the ambient autism literature, the ESDM trial design has many notable strengths. The intervention is manualized and attempts were made to establish treatment fidelity for the ESDM group. Currently-recognized gold-standard diagnostic instruments were used. By non-autism non-ABA standards, this is a very small trial, but it improves on an abysmal literature rife with even tinier trials. Most important, against the strong trend denying autistics even the possibility of good experimental design, this is an inexcusably rare RCT. 7. However, by  very well-established standards in non-autism non-ABA areas , the ESDM RCT is in many respects poorly reported, which makes it difficult to properly asssess its design.  8. The control condition lacks virtually any useful description much less a rationale. Unspecified individuals provided the control group parents with unspecified information (what \"resource manuals\"? what \"reading materials\"?) including about unspecified services. The authors briefly trot out a few generic types of available services without indicating whether they were recommended or chosen. Children in this group received on average ~9hrs/wk of unspecified individual therapy plus the same of unspecified group-level therapy. Only mean intensities are reported--no SDs much less ranges. We don't know whether some children received huge amounts of intervention while others received none.  9. In my view, the authors' documented astonishing lack of interest in their own control group speaks to the very human expectations and biases applied to this group, which would be unlikely not to affect their outcomes.   10. Crucial information about who or what generated the randomization sequence, and whether or how allocation was concealed, is missing.  11. Remarkably, 51 autistic children were originally randomized to the two groups. Three disappear off to the side somehow, no explanation given,  after  random assigment to groups but  without showing up in either group . Two assigned to the ESDM group rejected this intervention due to its requirements. The third, of unreported group assignment, was found to be not autistic, but Rett's. But none of these randomly allocated children shows up in their assigned group.  12. Even with the 48 children deemed to be assigned to a group, there is no intention to treat analysis. Data were ultimately lost from 3 children in the control group, no reason given.  13. The pre-post use of the ADOS as a scale of \"severity\" raises numerous questions. The first preliminary attempt at creating such a scale was not accepted for publication until  the end of 2008 (and not epublished until 2009) . This scale is further based on the  revised ADOS algorithm , which is not cited by DawsonG et al. (2010) and was not accepted for publication until mid-2006.  14. Blinding is notoriously difficult in these kinds of trials. Parents cannot be blinded to intervention group, but some measures rely on parent report. While evaluators are described as \"naive to invervention status,\" they are not described as blind to the nature and purpose of the study or of ESDM. Those involved in providing ESDM would in addition be aware of the study's purpose, importance, and outcome measures.  About the reported results of the ESDM RCT (DawsonG et al., 2010) 1. The ESDM manual provides results claimed to be from DawsonG et al. (2010), which is referred to both as \"in press\" and as a published 2010 Pediatrics paper. Inexplicably, information and data in the manual reported as being from DawsonG et al. (2010) differs somewhat from what is reported in the paper. There are also contradictions about the RCT within the ESDM manual regarding, for example, number of children in the ESDM group and intensity of the intervention they received.  2. There is an obvious error in the data in DawsonG et al. (2010). I spotted it immediately on first reading, as should anyone--you don't need to be able to do math in your head--who actually looks at the data. For two of the Vineland subscales (daily living and motor skills), some data are apparently reversed from Table 1 to Table 2, such that data in one table does not correspond to data in the other. The persistence of such an obvious error through copy-editing and so on raises questions about whether there are less obvious errors.  3. The main result is in the Mullen composite. On this score, the ESDM group finished at ~79, representing an ~18 point change from baseline but almost no change from the first year score of ~76. There is a just-significant 11-point change score advantage for the ESDM group over their controls at the two-year evaluation, an advantage which diminished from first to second year evaluations. The Mullen ESDM advantage is concentrated in the expressive and receptive language subscales. 4. Most striking re the Mullen composite is the huge increase in the scatter of ESDM scores. First and second year SDs are ~23 and ~24, much higher than baseline (SD ~9) and much higher than in the control group. Regardless, ranges of scores are not provided. But clearly one effect of ESDM is to dramatically increase variability of outcomes at a very young age. The ~11-point year two ESDM group advantage is drowned in their ~24-point SD.  5. While the ESDM group outperformed their controls on the Vineland composite, this results from the control condition reducing Vineland scores. These scores depend on unblinded parent report, which would plausibly reflect the disinterest and low expectations, obvious in how this study is reported, conveyed and applied to the control group. The ESDM group, regardless of their important advantages in this respect, did not experience any improvement in their Vineland scores over two years.  6. In addition, the ESDM group's Vineland scores show a huge increase in scatter, not found in the controls, by year two. The SD balloons from ~6 to ~16 (and from ~8 to ~22 in the communication sub-scale). Again, the ESDM's effect is to greatly increase variability in outcomes.  7. The authors dedicate a lot of space to claims of group differences in subjectively-determined diagnostic status. Those changes were limited to moves between autism and PDD-NOS--none of the children were judged nonautistic. However, on the ADOS, the only reported quantitative measure which offers the possibility of differentiating PDD-NOS from autism, the groups did not differ in outcome. Also, diagnosis was remarkably stable in this study,  compared to previous findings  regarding children in the  30-month-or-younger age range .  8. Apart from not differing on ultimate ADOS \"severity\" scores, the groups did not differ on a repetitive behaviours scale. The ESDM did not make autistic children measurably \"less severely autistic\" by the usual standards.  9. The premise of ESDM is that only through displaying proper typical social interaction and behaviour can autistics begin to learn anything worth learning. In the two reported measures of social abilities (ADOS, Vineland socialization), the ESDM children did not do any better than their controls at either evaluation. They did not improve (by the usual standards) pre-post, with losses in Vineland socialization.  10. The ubiquitous claim that \"earlier is better\" accompanying the publicity for this study is unjustified. The authors made no attempt to correlate outcomes with their 12-month possible age-range at intake. To the contrary, the authors enacted the view that younger children at intake must receive more intervention in order to be judged alongside children who were older at intake--the contrary position to \"earlier is better.\"  11. The ESDM can only be used up to 60 months, with objectives targeted at children up to 48 months. At the end of this RCT, the ESDM children had a possible age range (actual range not reported) from 48 to 54 months. All were still autistic or PDD-NOS. Given the enormous increase in scatter of Mullen and Vineland scores, some had done extremely poorly by the usual standards. Against the unfounded claims of \"earlier is better,\" questions arise as to how being so judged at such a young age within a highly publicized intervention will affect these children.  12. In reporting the ESDM RCT, the ESDM manual states that \"ESDM needs to be independently replicated before it can be considered an empirically supported treatment.\" But  a recent paper whose senior author is Sally Rogers  claims that ESDM is \"evidence-based\" and that its components are \"empirically supported.\"  A few last comments Eric Fombonne has published a  Pediatrics eLetter about the ESDM RCT . He concurs with some points I make, not with others, and he failed to spot the error in the data.  If you rummage around in the  ClinicalTrials.gov  site you will find an in-progress multi-site RCT of the ESDM where intake age range has been dropped to 12 to 24 months. You will also find a multi-site RCT, targeting 5-12 month old children considered \"at risk\" for autism, which will likely use ESDM-type intervention in an effort to prevent autism.  As a large body of work, the ESDM manual, RCT, and other related materials, including the formal and informal work of Geraldine Dawson and Sally Rogers, read like a total condemnation of what I've done in the above. I'm not supposed to notice details and errors, contradictions and anomalies--or if I inappropriately do, I should forget about them and concentrate on emitting socially-appropriate responses (pick up the blocks, bang them together, put them down-- don't look at them ). I'm not supposed to notice other discrepancies, for instance between recognized scientific and ethical standards and those imposed on autistics. I'm supposed to direct all my effort towards the developmentally-appropriate equivalent of \"birthday party games!\" The above should be verifiable, through reading the supplied sources. As usual, if I've made any factual errors, always a possibility, please let me know.  References: Dawson, G., Rogers, S., Munson, J., Smith, M., Winter, J., Greenson, J., Donaldson, A., & Varley, J.

{"date": "Saturday, October 03, 2009", "body": "\nThe statement that \"autistic people are persons\" is part of the 2008 decision by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in  Dawson vs Canada Post Corporation . Today,  this decision  is one year old. Here is the relevant excerpt: [133] This said, there is no doubt for the Tribunal that autistic people are persons, that unfortunately they are not well accepted in society, that they are looked at often times as special creatures who are not part of society as a whole and that society would be better off without them. The Tribunal is further of the view that autistic people need to be better respected and protected in society. They need above all to be better understood and accepted. [...]  [134] Hence, the Tribunal is of the view that the  Canadian Human Rights Act  provides to autistic people the same protection as to non autistic people and that both are equal before and under the law. These statements are contrary to existing Canadian jurisprudence. In ABA-related litigation, autism advocates have used Canada's major human rights laws, including our highest law, the  Charter of Rights and Freedoms , to deny the humanity, personhood, equality and human rights of most autistics in Canada.  This wholesale denial and dehumanization is exemplified in the  Auton  and  Wynberg  trial decisions. These two decisions have been universally revered and promoted by autism advocates, as representing what autistics deserve.  Autism advocates also universally opposed my  intervention in  Auton , which sought to inform the Supreme Court of Canada that, contrary to the positions of both sides,  autistics are human beings with human rights , and this status should not be denied to most autistics in Canada.  By \"most autistics,\" I mean those of us, the majority of autistics in Canada, who have not received unlimited ABA-based interventions starting early in life.  To my knowledge, the CHRT decision in my case is unprecedented in Canada, in recognizing the personhood, humanity, equality, and human rights of autistics--regardless of which interventions we have or have not received at any point in our lives. More about the CHRT decision, including its serious problems, can be found  here , and some background is  here .  The CHRT decision was not appealed by Canada Post. It has also been  cited in another case , this time decided in Federal Court, involving an autistic and Canada Post. Here is an example of how my case was cited, from paragraph 79: The  Dawson  case above, specifically is critical of rigid corporate rules that preclude true inclusiveness of those with disabilities such as the applicants. The decision in my case was helpful in giving another autistic person the chance to pursue, if she wishes, a human rights case based on Canada Post's decision not to hire her. And the Federal Court decision in turn includes language which may further help other autistics seeking to be regarded and treated as human beings with human rights.   Autistic people are persons--happy anniversary.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/chrt/doc/2008/2008chrt41/2008chrt41.html", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_fac.html", "http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2009/2009fc715/2009fc715.html"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2009/10/autistic-people-are-persons-anniversary.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, February 10, 2010", "body": "\n Here they are  and here are ten off-the-cuff thoughts: 1. The most sit-up-and-take-notice change is the total removal of Rett syndrome from the DSM. It is gone. The DSM-V people are saying, \"genetic syndromes don't belong in our book,\" or words to that effect, and I agree.  2. Indeed the vast majority of named neurodevelopmental disabilities do not appear in the DSM, past, present, or future. This raises the question of why autism is there. Rett's being excluded is not going to immediately result in Rett's individuals being catastrophically deprived of recognition or assistance. Instead it may result in these individuals being regarded more accurately, to their great benefit. Removing autism from the DSM would have the same beneficial effect.  3. Another change to grapple with: CDD (Childhood Disintegrative Disorder) is now lumped in with autism, which in turn has a single vaguely phrased onset criterion. To cover CDD (Volkmar et al., 2005), that criterion will have to cover onset at age 5 (fairly common in CDD) and up to age nine (rare, but happens).  4. In addition, autism and CDD have very different cognitive profiles. This is one of many ways in which the DSM-V, even more than its predecessor, is running away from the productive and beneficial--to autistics--notion of autism as a cognitive phenotype.  5. The headline-making but most predictable--and most predictably responded to--change is the loss of Asperger's and PDD-NOS,  which have both always been considered part of the autistic spectrum , as distinct-from-autism diagnoses. Whatever their shortcomings, the loss of these diagnoses is another signal that autism is, officially and more so than ever, merely a series of deficits in overt typical behaviour.  6. At the very least, the DSM-V strongly discourages any view of autism as an atypical cognitive phenotype involving relative (to nonautistics) cognitive strengths and weaknesses.  7. The changed criteria, which collapse the DSM-IV social and communication domains, overlook any role for  manual and oral motor abilities in these two areas . And whose definition of the now-mandatory social reciprocity criterion will prevail? Here is  John Constantino's   one-way-street  definition:  Reciprocal social behavior refers to the extent to which a child engages in emotionally appropriate turn-taking social interaction with others.  The closer-to-equal time, so to speak, now granted the previously-relegated RIRB (restricted interests and repetitive behaviours) domain could be seen as progress, ditto the disappearance of the \"nonfunctional\" assumption. But autistics will no longer have DSM-IV unusually focused and intense interests (a strength), we will instead be pathologically fixated.  8. The vagueness and subjectivity of the criteria should later be elaborated on with explanatory text which may add or subtract clarity. And the highly-publicized DSM-V effort to rank and classify all autistics  according to a rigid hierarchy of \"severity\"  is as yet missing. How the DSM-V will handle aspects of the by-far most important distinction within the autistic spectrum--the idiopathic vs etiological autism distinction (and see genetic syndromes, above)--remains to be seen. 9. While the DSM-V has enormous political clout, what might change in actual diagnostic practices is unclear. Clinicians and entities currently employing anything-goes or free-for-all and/or expedient-type standards are unlikely to change in this respect. And in many ways DSM-V autism is autism altered to conform to the current \"gold-standard\" autism diagnostic instruments (see the role of Catherine Lord in both), whose predominance, weaknesses and limitations have come to determine what autism is and isn't.  10. Organizations which (a) have little use for basic autism research (the kind I'm involved in) or actually oppose it; and (b) promote political views of autism, including that more services are always better--will likely be happy with the DSM-V changes. You can see ASAN fulfill this prediction  here .  Reference: Volkmar, F.R, Koenig, K., & State, M. (2005). Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. In: Volkmar, F.R., Paul, R., Klin, A.,Cohen, D.

{"date": "Thursday, July 23, 2009", "body": "\n Promotion first, science later, if ever. This pattern is near universal when it comes to autism interventions. In the absence of good quality research, autism interventions are loudly claimed to be effective.  For those promoting ABA-based autism interventions, claims of effectiveness unfounded in good quality research were only the first step. The real triumph has been widespread agreement that fair tests of ABA-based interventions are unethical and bad for autistics. As a result, any experimental design carrying the risk of being informative about the benefits and harms of ABA-based interventions has,  for a long time now ,  been considered unethical .  The practice of claiming effectiveness for an autism intervention which has not been fairly tested, then using these claims of effectiveness to deem fair tests unethical, has clear benefits to service providers. And this practice has received wall-to-wall support from autism advocates, who have in turn imposed it on autistics through lobbying and litigation.  Meanwhile,  this practice is not admired outside the realm of autism advocacy . Premature claims of effectiveness in themselves make fair tests of interventions more difficult--particularly, as is the case with many autism interventions, when blinding cannot be fully achieved. But those promoting ABA-based autism interventions go further and demand that autistics be entirely denied the benefit and protection of good experimental design.   In my view, this practice--its longstanding and widespread support by autism advocates, its more recent support by ASAN (example  here ), and its widespread imposition on autistics--continues to greatly harm autistics. Any group so denied such basic standards of science and ethics would be harmed.  Interestingly, not all autism researchers have stooped to prevailing autism advocacy standards. Some years ago, a pilot RCT of an early autism intervention was published (Aldred et al., 2004). The intervention was manualized, of relatively low intensity, and targeted solely at the parents of preschool autistic children. Through a true experimental design, the intervention was found to have several significant positive effects, most markedly in increasing the expressive language of very young autistic children.  Successful RCTs of early autism interventions are virtually non-existent. But the researchers involved in Aldred et al. (2004) totally failed to go forth and proclaim the effectiveness of their manualized intervention. After all, they only had a small pilot RCT--the same size as the only published RCT, not a notably successful one (Smith et al., 2000, 2001), in the entire 48-year history of research into ABA-based autism interventions.  Instead of issuing premature claims of effectiveness, the authors of Aldred et al. (2004) and many other collaborating UK researchers went on to conduct a large multi-site RCT, the  Preschool Autism Communication Trial . They received  MRC funding for this 4-year project in 2005 .  Some information about the PACT's design has been reported in a recent paper (Aldred & Green, 2009).  The trial began in early 2006 and will finish late this year. The researchers hoped to recruit 144 preschool autistic children across three sites, but exceeded their expectations and recruited 152. These children were randomized into two arms, one receiving the PACT intervention, while children in both arms continued to receive whatever other interventions their parents chose (\"treatment as usual\"). So far as I know, the PACT is larger than any existing published RCT in the history of autism research. The PACT's design means that it carries a good risk of being informative about the effectiveness of the studied intervention. There is no good reason for the PACT to be unprecedented, but it is.  In  one of the PACT's recent newsletters , the PACT's Chief Investigator, Jonathan Green, notes that there has been a lot of interest in the PACT manual and in \"training opportunities\" with respect to this intervention. Dr Green responds: Until we have the results of the trial we are not able to disseminate the intervention manual or to undertake any training; but be assured that after the results are in (and depending of course on the outcome in terms of effectiveness!) we do have potential plans in place for such dissemination. In other words, and keeping in mind there is a successful published pilot RCT, there are no plans to disseminate information about the intervention--not until there is good quality evidence as to its effectiveness. This is the recognized scientific standard in non-autism areas.  Aldred et al. (2004) and the PACT shouldn't in any way be above scrutiny or criticism. For example, I can see problems in how Aldred et al. (2004) was designed (I mention one of them  here ), which may or may not be carried over to the PACT. But the pilot RCT and the resulting PACT generally demonstrate the only science- and ethics-based sequence when it comes to interventions and treatments: good quality research first,  then  think about spreading the word.

This opens a NYT opinion piece written by Evan Kemp. While Mr Kemp raises concerns about a specific fundraising event, his statements have much broader relevance.  For instance, Mr Kemp writes of the great harm that ensues when disabled children are denied the possibility of learning from successful disabled adults. The autism advocacy signature argument that disabled adults with achievements cannot really be disabled is not directly mentioned. But this is just another way to deny that successful disabled adults exist and it carries the same consequences.  Mr Kemp also notes how portraying disability as \"overwhelmingly destructive\" results in fear of disabled people and our consequent segregation from society. Then there is the issue of research priorities, some of which have the effect of supporting:  the damaging and common prejudice that handicapped people are \"sick.\" As sick people, it follows that we should allow others to take care of all our needs until a cure is found. Throughout his piece, Mr Kemp emphasizes that regarding disabled people as frightening and pathetic infantilizes us and leads us towards segregation, hopelessness, and dependence, to the great detriment of ourselves and others. Mr Kemp concludes with many recommendations, including:  Problems of economic waste, demoralization and segregation can be solved only when disabled people are depicted in the light of our very real accomplishments, capabilities and rights. Mr Kemp's opinion piece was published almost three decades ago, in 1981. You can find it  here . Autism advocacy continues to run in the opposite direction, rejecting and rolling back what we have learned about disability and human rights, going backwards in time to before Mr Kemp ever said a word.

Tyler Cowen and I have co-authored a new paper asking two questions.  What does the Turing test really mean? And how many human beings (including Turing) could pass?  Our premise is that some aspects of Turing's paper have not received sufficient attention: Turing\u2019s paper is rich and multi-faceted and we are not seeking to overturn all of the extant interpretations. We do wish to suggest that a potent and indeed subversive perspective in the paper has been underemphasized. Some of the message of Turing\u2019s paper is encouraging us to take a broader perspective on intelligence and some of his points are  ethical  in nature. Turing\u2019s paper is about the possibility of unusual forms of intelligence, our inability to recognize those intelligences, and the limitations of indistinguishability as a standard for defining intelligence. \u201cInability to imitate does not rule out intelligence\u201d is an alternative way of reading many parts of his argument. Turing was issuing the warning that we should not dismiss or persecute entities which we cannot easily categorize or understand. The facts of Turing's life enter into our argument, as does autism in many respects. Here is what we conclude: It is possible that Turing conceived of his imitation test precisely because he had so much difficulty \u201cpassing\u201d and communicating himself. In social settings these facts were seen as disabilities but in the longer term they helped Turing produce this brilliant essay. Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

The study is based on questions sent to schools about the UK SEN (Special Education Needs) register, and a survey, including a screening questionaire, sent to parents of students aged 5 to 9 years. Many schools, 66 out of 162, refused to participate. Of schools that agreed, 79 of 96, representing 8824 out of 11,635 children, provided SEN register information. Of the surveys sent to parents, 29%, representing 3373 out of 11,700 children, were responded to.   Participating schools located 83 children identified as autistic spectrum according to the SEN register. Of these, 10 children were assigned the specific diagnosis of autism (I'll call them \"specific-autism\"), while the rest were assigned other autistic spectrum diagnoses (\"other-spectrum\"). None of these diagnoses was verified by Baron-Cohen et al. (2009) in any way. These 83 SEN children constitute 94/10,000 of the proposed 157/10,000.  In the survey, parents were asked whether their child had an existing autistic spectrum diagnosis. The authors \"confirmed,\" to their standards, through information from parents only, diagnoses for 19 children. Four others attended special schools and were assumed to be \"confirmed\" as autistic without any verification, for a total of 23. No information about how many of these children are specific-autism or other-spectrum is given. The 23 children were expanded into a prevalence of 99/10,000--impressively close to the SEN register figure.  The screening questionaire sent to parents was the recently re-named CAST (Childhood Autism Spectrum Test). All children reported by parents as scoring above one CAST threshold, and a minority of children scoring above a lower CAST threshold, and who were not already reported by the parent survey to be autistic, were invited for assessment. Eventually 77 children underwent assessment by ADOS, ADI-R, and clinical judgment. Eleven children were given autistic spectrum diagnoses--four specific-autism, seven other-spectrum.  So there are three sets of autistic children here: 83 SEN children, 23 diagnosis survey children, and 11 CAST children. The CAST children are considered to represent \"unknown\" or \"undetected\" autistics in schools, while the other two sets of children (SEN and diagnosis) represent equivalent samples of \"known\" autistics who have been located in two different ways from very nearly the same cohort.  Working from the diagnosis and CAST samples, Baron-Cohen et al. (2009) come up with a ratio of total number of cases (known plus unknown) to known cases, which yields a multiplier of 1.67. This in turn is applied to the SEN-based prevalence of 94/10,000, resulting in that grand total of 157/10,000.  And this all looks quite reasonable.  Even the Neuroskeptic thinks so . But here are a few things I noticed.  The authors report no means of verifying whether the SEN and diagnosis samples are equivalent, an assumption on which the study depends. There is a dearth of demographic information, including the absence of any reported demographic measure common to both the SEN and diagnosis samples.   And for neither \"known\" sample (SEN and diagnosis) were any of the diagnoses verified either through direct assessment or direct access to records. Other recently reported UK epidemiology has not arrived at such a tidy agreement between prevalence of existing autism diagnoses and prevalence of autistics on the SEN register, nor at such a high prevalence using information from one or both sources.  Before they started sending out surveys, Baird et al. (2006) found that about 15% of 255 autistics with a \"known\" autism diagnosis (according to various health and clinical records) were not on the SEN register--under any diagnosis at all. This percentage would likely be higher if SEN autistic spectrum diagnoses only were considered.  Whether the 255 \"known,\" pre-survey diagnoses from Baird et al. (2006) would be considered \"confirmed\" according to the standards of Baron-Cohen et al. (2009) is unclear to me, but in Baird et al. (2006), they add up to a prevalence of ~45/10,000. This is less than half the prevalence of what should be the comparable \"known\" diagnosis sample in Baron-Cohen et al. (2009).  Then there is Williams et al. (2008), where the authors had access to both medical  and SEN records for an entire 14,062-child cohort. Using both kinds of records, they located a total of 86 \"known\" autistics for a prevalence of ~62/10,000. Of these, 36% were found in medical records only; 17% were found in SEN records only; and 47% were found in both.  Here again the \"known\" diagnosis total prevalence, derived from direct examination of complete records rather than selective responding to questions directed at schools or parents, is a much lower figure than found via both the SEN and diagnosis samples in Baron-Cohen et al. (2009). And Williams et al. (2008) show that diagnoses appearing in medical records, and diagnoses recorded via SEN, do not produce the same samples of autistic children--at least, not when there is direct access to these records for a complete cohort.  The original contribution of Baron-Cohen et al. (2009) is, according to the authors, the attempt to identify school-aged autistics who haven't been spotted as atypical. This is claimed to set their study apart from Baird et al. (2006). But 8 of the 77 children chosen for direct assessment through CAST screening in Baron-Cohen et al. (2009) were reported to be from \"special schools\" which, according to the authors, \"require extensive assessment of individual special needs.\" Yet the authors suggest the CAST-screened sample was, in their words, ...quiet and cooperative at school and not difficult to manage and therefore teachers may not be aware that they have difficulties. I don't know whether the CAST-screened special school children (who may or may not have been in the final 11) were on the SEN register, but doesn't this seem likely? Assuming for now (because you can only assume) that this was not under an autism diagnosis, in fact these were exactly the children screened for autism by Baird et al. (2006)--all children on the SEN register for any reason.  Further in this direction, Baron-Cohen et al. (2009) surprisingly report no way for the authors to verify whether the CAST-screened children were or were not on the SEN register, under any diagnosis--including autism. But the study hinges on the two samples, the SEN and CAST samples, being independent from each other.  One more thing to note is the actual composition of the 157/10,000. These numbers come from the reported data. Here goes: 11/10,000: \"known\" specific-autism children (SEN register) 23/10,000: \"unknown\" specific-autism children (CAST screening) 83/10,000: \"known\" other-spectrum children (SEN register) 40/10,000: \"unknown\" other-spectrum children (CAST screening) If you add up the figures, you get the 157/10,000 total, of which 34/10,000--well within the range of previous findings--represents prevalence for the specific diagnosis of autism. The authors checked ratios of known to unknown autistic males vs females, and found no difference, showing that female autistics were not more likely than male autistics to be undetected. But the authors didn't check ratios of known to unknown autistics for specific-autism vs other-spectrum diagnoses.  If they did, they would find that for every known specific-autism child, there are about two unknown. The opposite is true for other-spectrum children, where about two are known for every unknown child. While only one-third of all specific-autism children are known, two thirds of other-spectrum children are known. Does this mean that children who meet criteria for the specific diagnosis of autism are much harder to spot, or are doing much better in school, than children who are popularly regarded as  having \"less severe\" autistic spectrum diagnoses ?  Or maybe the data are just very difficult to interpret. As usual, if I've made any factual errors, please let me know.

{"date": "Monday, June 15, 2009", "body": "\nI was asked briefly to comment on  the notion of \"severity\" of autism as currently proposed for the DSM-V . Here are some far from complete notes (some from earlier writing or work of mine) I organized in response: Currently, \u201cseverity\u201d of autism most often refers to the attempt to quantify the obviousness of autistic traits and abilities. The more obvious these traits and abilities are judged to be, and therefore the more atypical a person is judged to be, the more \u201csevere\u201d autism is considered to be.   Being \u201cmore severe\u201d (having more obvious autistic traits and abilities, or being more obviously atypical) is widely presumed to be worse than being \u201cless severe\u201d (having less obvious autistic traits and abilities or being less obviously atypical), while being not autistic at all (no obvious autistic traits and abilities) is considered an \u201coptimal outcome.\u201d However, there is no current consensus on what neurocognitive differences underlie observable autistic atypicalities and therefore fundamentally define what makes a person autistic rather than nonautistic. At this fundamental level (what autism is), there is currently no consensual way to judge who is \u201cmore autistic\u201d or \u201cless autistic\u201d (which would be construed as \u201cmore severely autistic\u201d and \u201cless severely autistic\u201d) or whether this would be good, bad or irrelevant.   Currently there is/are no consensual instrument(s) agreed to measure autism \u201cseverity.\u201d The major diagnostic instruments (ADOS, ADI-R) do not work like scales, though they have often and misleadingly been misapplied this way. A recent preliminary attempt to transform the ADOS into a scale of \u201cseverity\u201d has just been published (Gotham et al., 2009).  On popular measures of \u201cseverity\u201d (the CARS, the ADI-R improperly used as a scale, the SRS), an autistic who has one or more very high apparent abilities (that is, has a highly uneven profile of apparent abilities) will score as more \"severe\" than an autistic whose apparent abilities are uniformly low.   The large proportion of autistics recently reported to have exceptional skills (Howlin et al., 2009) would be judged as less \u201csevere\u201d if they lost those skills. Exceptional skills are considered to increase \u201cseverity\u201d (that is, atypicality) in autism, not decrease it. This would also likely be true of autistic cognitive strengths which have been revealed in the peer-reviewed literature in comparisons between the performance of autistics and nonautistics on a wide range of tasks (I have started compiling an inventory of these, which was the subject of an  IMFAR 2009 poster ). Indeed, at IMFAR 2009, the loss of exceptional autistic abilities ( Eigsti et al., 2009 ; from  Deborah Fein\u2019s group ) was reported as evidence for \u201coptimal outcomes\u201d in autism.  In the same direction, we have found that autistics who scored higher on pieces of the ADI-R (and would therefore commonly be assumed to be \"more severe\") had a wide range of better visual skills than autistics who scored lower on these measures (Caron et al., 2006).   Perhaps unsurprisingly then, autism \u201cseverity\u201d (defined and measured in various ways) has been a poor predictor of outcomes in autism (Howlin, 2005). Here are two examples from papers reporting very good outcomes in autism: It cannot be emphasized strongly enough that\u2026 it would have been impossible for anyone to predict this outcome.  (Kanner et al., 1972) \u2026 early history explained little of the variance in outcome. Indeed, the good and poor outcome groups differed little with respect to early impairments in social responsiveness, deviant language, and bizarre behaviors.  (Szatmari et al.,1989) Currently the best adult outcomes reported in the literature still belong to autistics who as children met the narrowest, strictest, and presumed-to-be most \u201csevere\u201d autism diagnostic criteria ever devised (Kanner et al., 1972; Szatmari et al., 1989; Farley et al., 2009). Asperger (1944/1991) described an individual whose outcome was outstanding (he was a successful academic) as \u201cgrossly autistic\u201d with \u201cimpossible behavior,\u201d etc.   Some of the most obvious (that is, most \u201csevere\u201d)  and  successful autistics have been and continue to be individuals regarded as autistic savants. Indeed, the \u201cobviousness\u201d of these individuals, the fact that their atypicalities are so obvious (which would be judged as so \u201csevere\u201d), has been successfully exploited in the autism literature as a means of investigating the fundamental atypicalities which make autistics autistic.   The assumption that having more obvious autistic traits and abilities is bad (\u201cmore severe\u201d) has resulted in prejudicial judgments in the literature. An autistic boy (who has accomplished more as a child and young adult than most people, autistic or otherwise) with a full-scale IQ of more than 100 and a strong performance on numerous tests is judged to be \u201clow-functioning,\u201d because he is so obviously atypical. That is, he is judged to be very \u201cseverely\u201d autistic (Bonneh et al., 2008; Belmonte et al., 2009), and this must solely be a very bad thing. In Aldred et al. (2004), preschool autistic children are falsely judged to be \u201clow-functioning\u201d or \u201chigh-functioning\u201d solely on the basis of presumed autism \u201cseverity\u201d falsely drawn from ADOS scores. It is being falsely and prejudicially assumed that an autistic whose traits and abilities are more obvious must function poorly.  The proposed DSM-V changes will enhance societal prejudices against autistic traits and abilities. These prejudices already serve to prevent autistics whose traits and abilities are more obvious from being considered able to learn, to communicate, to make decisions about our lives, to walk around freely, to be employed, etc. Under the proposed DSM-V changes, autistics who are highly and obviously atypical would be even more harshly judged, without there being anything approaching a sufficient empirical rationale for this. Autistics whose communication and social interaction is highly atypical, or who most strongly pursue their focused abilities and interests (something which has widely been acknowledged leads to good outcomes, but has largely not interested researchers; Howlin, 2005), will now be at risk of being regarded as \u201cmost severe.\u201d This is at a time when the term \u201csevere autism\u201d is popularly equated with low expectations, hopelessness, dread and horror.  Also, in my experience, the term \u201csevere autism\u201d is commonly used as a justification for why autistic people not only can but must be treated in ways that would be instantly recognized as unacceptable in any other population. This includes lowering or discarding very basic standards of science and ethics, a pervasive practice now applied to the entire autistic population. I am referring to the basic standards of science and ethics that automatically protect and benefit nonautistics, and without which they could not proceed safely in society, much less have good outcomes.  The proposed DSM-V wording raises numerous specific concerns; I will mention two. One is that it enshrines the false and harmful assumption, an assumption showing a striking absence of reciprocity on the part of the DSM-V committee, that if autistics communicate or interact in atypical and possibly very adaptive ways, then this communication or interaction must be defective or wrong, or must not exist at all. Another concern is that by using words such as \u201crituals,\u201d the DSM-V is perpetuating the misconstrual of autistics\u2019 focused abilities and interests (and motor mannerisms). This misconstrual led to the demonstrably false and harmful assumption that autistics\u2019 atypicalities in this area amount to \u201cobsessions\u201d and must be treatable in the same manner as OCD (see recent failed citalopram RCT, King et al., 2009; a failed fluoxetine RCT has been announced by  Neuropharm  and  Autism Speaks , but not published yet).   In these and other ways the proposed DSM-V autism criteria define possibly very adaptive but atypical autistic traits and abilities as being more \u201csevere\u201d (worse or more defective) the more they are obvious. This leads to the assumption that such traits and abilities should ideally be suppressed and eliminated. References:    Aldred, C., Green, J., & Adams, C. (2004).

{"date": "Thursday, May 14, 2009", "body": "\n You have seen the autism recovery story  in   the   media . Bloggers  have   jumped   in  too. I was at  IMFAR 2009 in Chicago  and saw the educational symposium presentation by Deborah Fein that was the stated cause of all the excitement.  But  in her presentation, as in her abstract , Dr Fein did not associate the findings she reported with any kind or quantity of autism intervention or treatment. When speaking at IMFAR, she expressed doubt that this in fact could be done. Dr Fein  clearly added more information when speaking with the media . She expressed her view that recovery from autism, what Dr Fein calls \"optimal outcome,\" was associated with early intensive ABA-based autism interventions. Like all researchers, she is free to say what she wishes to the media.  However, her statements relating kinds and amounts of intervention to outcomes in autistic children are not supported by any of the data she chose to present at IMFAR 2009, either in her  oral presentation  or in a  series of   related   posters .  Indeed her study design does not permit any conclusions about effectiveness of interventions, no matter how \"effectiveness\" is defined. She has not conducted a true experimental design in which well-known sources of bias can to some degree be accounted for and therefore the effects of interventions, their benefits and harms, can usefully be assessed.  In order to claim that conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of interventions in Dr Fein's study, as it has been presented, you have to be willing to reject and discard even the most basic standards of science. These are the basic standards that automatically protect and benefit nonautistics, the basic standards that were developed because without them people were harmed.  Two other aspects of what Dr Fein presented at IMFAR 2009 are noteworthy. One is that a major paper in the literature, published not long ago, reported a very high rate of what is now being called recovery from autism. To my knowledge, this paper did not make headlines.  Turner and Stone (2007) were looking at the stability of autism diagnosis at around age two years (mean age of 29 months). They carefully used various combinations within what is considered the gold-standard diagnosis: ADOS, ADI-R, and clinical judgment. And they found that early diagnosis, in their sample of 48 originally autistic children, was very unstable.  By age four (mean age of 53 months), only 53% of children originally given the specific diagnosis of autism retained this specific diagnosis, while only 68% were still on the autistic spectrum. The rest were not. That is a 32% rate of \"recovery.\" Only 40% of children originally diagnosed with PDD-NOS at age two still had an autistic spectrum diagnosis by age four. That would be a 60% rate of \"recovery.\"  The children whose age two diagnoses were unstable were largely still regarded as having difficulties, a finding that echoes Dr Fein's work, but they no longer could be diagnosed as autistic.  Turner and Stone (2007) attempted to associate instability of diagnosis (what is being called \"recovery\") with interventions received, but no association was found. They report: All children in the sample received speech therapy, and the majority received additional interventions. There were no significant differences between the Stable and Change groups for the amount of speech therapy,  t (46) = .30,  p  = .77, behavioral therapy,  t (46) = .78,  p  = .44, occupational therapy,  t (46) = 1.90,  p  = .06, special education,  t (46) = 1.96,  p  = .06, or regular preschool,  t (46) = .13,  p  = .90. Of the 6 children who received an average of 20 or more hours of intervention per week, 5 were in the Stable group and 1 was in the Change group. In other words, few of the 48 originally autistic children in this study received what would be considered \"intensive\" intervention, and the majority of those who did kept their autism diagnosis.  In contrast, Turner and Stone (2007) found that diagnostic instability was related to earliness of diagnosis: the earlier the diagnosis, the more unstable it was.  The authors go on to discuss what may underlie the diagnostic instability they found while using the best available diagnostic standards. In fact there are many possible explanations. One point they do underline, however, is that given their findings,  ...extreme caution must be taken when interpreting intervention findings that suggest \u2018cures.\u2019 And of course that would include intervention findings that suggest \"recovery.\" This may be all the more so when diagnosis, and therefore intervention, is very early.  Also noteworthy is Dr Fein's use of the term \"optimal outcome,\" a term she prefers to \"recovery.\" Dr Fein and her colleagues have determined the  criteria for optimal outcomes in autism , and these criteria assume that autistics who remain autistic are suboptimal. Remaining autistic is an undesired, unsatisfactory, inferior, suboptimal result. According to Dr Fein, and those enthusiastically promoting her views, we know what an optimal human being is like, and this optimal human being is not autistic. An optimal outcome is not Stephen Wiltshire or Alex Bain or Daniel Tammet or Derek Paravicini or Hugo Lamoureux or Vernon Smith or Richard Bocherds or Danny Melvin or Tony DeBlois or janet norman-bain or Jessica Park or Temple Grandin or the large proportion of autistics found recently to have exceptional skills (Howlin et al., 2009) or me for that matter.  Indeed, Dr Fein's group has proposed  loss of exceptional autistic skills  as evidence for optimal outcomes. And given the great support Dr Fein's views have received, we should be in little doubt as to the goals of popularly demanded autism interventions, and the consequences for those of us who for whatever reason remain unrecovered. The decision as to which kind of human being is optimal and which kind is not has been made.  References: Howlin, P., Goode, S., Hutton, J., & Rutter, M. (2009).

Autism is modestly mentioned in the third topic only (lives will be saved), even though claims that behaviour analysis can save the economy by saving children from autism are  as common  as they are  unfounded in existing published evidence .  Looking around the  2009 ABAI convention program , you will in fact bump into the notion that ABA can, and should, save the world. For instance, from Tutorial #287: This presentation will inspire a reconsideration of how ABA can save the world... the presenter will discuss the relevance of courage and compassion in realizing the potential of ABA to save the world... Symposium #403 at this year's ABAI convention is chaired by Matthew Israel (Judge Rotenberg Center), and is titled: The Use of Contingent Skin Shock in Treating Behaviors Other than Aggression and Self-Abuse The three presenters in Symposium #403 are all from the Judge Rotenberg Center. Nathan Blenkush, BCBA-D (this is the highest status certification for behaviour analysts currently available), describes his presentation this way: There are a number of topographies of problem behaviors that are intractable to standard behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions that cannot be classified as aggressive or self-abusive behaviors. In this presentation, we will describe the successful treatment of a variety of intractable behaviors using Contingent Skin Shock. First, we will review the literature associated with the use of CSS to treat non-aggressive and non-self injurious behaviors. Second, we will discuss how problem behaviors such as property destruction, major disruption (e.g. yelling, tantrums,), noncompliance or any other behavior in excess can severely harm students and completely interfere with treatment, education, and social development. Finally, we will present a series of case studies that will illustrate the use of CSS to treat these types of behaviors. Finally, we will discuss the treatment of these behaviors within the framework of the right to effective treatment. Robert Von Heyn, BCBA-D, describes his presentation this way: We describe the use of supplementary Contingent Skin Shock (CSS) to address intractable behaviors other than aggression and self-abuse. From 2003 to 2006, CSS was added to the programs of 72 students. However, in June of 2006, the New York State Department of Education put into effect regulations that limited the use of skin shock to aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. Subsequently, a federal judge temporarily blocked these regulations at the request of the parents and treatment resumed for most of these students. Here we first describe the initial effect of adding CSS to the students programs. Second, we describe the effect of the temporary suspension of the treatment for behaviors such as major disruption, property destruction, and noncompliance. Third, we describe how the regulations affected the treatment of problem behaviors such as aggression and self-abuse. Finally, we describe the effect of the reintroduction of CSS treatment, following intervention by a federal judge, for destructive, major disruptive, and noncompliant behaviors. And Nick Lowther describes his presentation this way: In June of 2006, the New York State Department of Education put into effect a set of regulations related to the use of aversive interventions such as Contingent Skin Shock (CSS). The regulations limited the use of CSS (and other procedures such as mechanical restraint) only to aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. The regulations also placed a number of other restrictions on the use of procedures such as CSS. However, after 9 weeks, in September of 2006, a federal judge temporarily blocked these regulations at the request of the parents. In this presentation, we discuss the impact these regulations had on the students at the Judge Rotenberg Center. In addition, the history of this lawsuit will be discussed. Finally, we will provide an update regarding the current status of the suit. Symposium #403 comes with a written \"Purpose,\" which adds little to the above except the false information that existing evidence supports the use of contingent electric shock for some behaviours. It is true that the current edition of the major ABA textbook (Cooper et al., 2007) promotes the use of electric shock with developmentally disabled people. But setting aside ethical issues which should not be set aside, Cooper et al. (2007) cite no good quality evidence arising from good experimental design, or anything even close, in support of this practice. In this major ABA textbook, very poor standards of science and ethics, which are known to harm human beings, coincide and are promoted as what autistics and other developmentally disabled people deserve.  In contrast there are scientists who, at least in some instances, have regarded autistics and other developmentally disabled people as deserving the benefit and protection of recognized standards of science and ethics. These scientists have unsurprisingly revealed the  extremely well-established  and  well-recognized  (outside of autism and ABA areas) importance of good experimental design (Tyrer et al., 2008; abstract is  here , short description  here ).  I will not be attending the 2009 ABAI convention. The publicly available statements by the JRC presenters, two of whom are BCBAs at the highest level, are provided  unedited here to speak for themselves. While the JRC's specific practices are the subject of controversy in some quarters, their stated standards are  widely promoted as the only way to save autistics , and are not in any way unique to the JRC.

This was the biggest IMFAR to date, with more than 1350 attendees.

Dawson & L. Mottron, Centre d'excellence en troubles envahissants du d\u00e9veloppement de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (CETEDUM), Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada  Background: Until recently, there has been little interest in autistic cognitive strengths. Instead, autistic strengths revealed through comparisons between the performance of autistic and nonautistic individuals on various tasks have been largely reported or interpreted as evidence for autistic cognitive deficits (Baron-Cohen, 2005; Gernsbacher et al., 2006; Mottron et al., 2008). Also, there is currently no compilation of empirically documented autistic cognitive strengths as reported in the existing literature. Accordingly, little is known about the full range and quantity of autistic cognitive strengths or the variety and number of autistic individuals in which these strengths have been found. Objectives: Our aim was to further understanding of cognitive strengths in the autistic population by identifying, quantifying and characterizing existing studies reporting these strengths. Methods: We located and characterized papers published in peer-reviewed journals which reported autistic cognitive strengths. In order to be included, studies had to compare the performance of autistics to the performance of nonautistics on a task, and autistics had to be reported to perform better than their controls on the task. Studies specific to autistic savants and hyperlexics were excluded, as were probable but unclear reports of autistic strengths, and accidental findings arising from matching strategies. Autistic cognitive strengths originally reported and/or interpreted as deficits were included.  Results: In total, 52 distinct types of autistic cognitive strengths were found, reported in 71 papers (12 reporting two or more strength types) spanning from the 1970s to the present. Only 13 papers published prior to 2000 reported strengths, but at least five papers reporting strengths have been published every year starting in 2000, with the highest number per year in 2008 (N=13). Twelve of the 52 strength types were reported in at least two, and up to 10, papers, with the most replicated finding being superior performance in embedded figures tasks. While most strengths (N=36) were found via tasks using nonsocial information, several strengths involving social information (N=8) and language (N=7) were reported. Sample size for autistic groups ranged from 3 to 40, with a mean of 16, while mean age of autistic participants within samples ranged from 2 to 39 years. Total number of autistics, encompassing 81 different samples, was 1351, of whom 885 had the specific diagnosis of autism, while 130 were diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, and 336 were in the general \u201cASD\u201d category. Of the 71 papers, 25 included autistic individuals judged to be intellectually disabled according to commonly used instruments, and 29 reported or interpreted one or more findings of autistic cognitive strengths as one or more deficits. Conclusions: Numerous distinct autistic cognitive strengths, some of them highly replicated, in a wide range of areas, and displayed by a large number and great variety of autistic individuals, have been reported in the literature. Failing to acknowledge the importance of autistic cognitive strengths may impede efforts to understand autistic differences and assist autistic individuals. We recommend more consistent and transparent reporting and interpretation of autistic cognitive strengths and more attention to their importance.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autism-insar.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=36&Itemid=105", "http://www.autism-insar.org/", "http://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2009/webprogram/start.html", "http://www.autism-insar.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=19&Itemid=82", "http://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2009/webprogram/Paper4980.html", "http://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2009/webprogram/Paper4279.html"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2009/05/autistic-strengths-at-imfar-2009.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 27, 2009", "body": "\n There are real and fake smiles that can be distinguished visually, if you know how, and it turns out that there are real and fake laughs.  William Hudenko , a clinician and researcher, patiently explained this to me at  IMFAR 2009 . Real laughs are \"voiced\" versus fake laughs that are \"unvoiced\" and these two kinds of laughs can be distinguished acoustically.  Hudenko et al. (in press)  describe voiced laughs as having a \"tonal, song-like quality\" and as \"strongly associated with positive affect,\" while unvoiced laughs are \"largely atonal and noisier.\" Instead of reflecting a person's genuine emotions, unvoiced laughs are hypothesized to reflect various social signals.  When nonautistics laugh, about half the time their laughs are unvoiced. So how do autistics laugh?  Hudenko and his colleagues collected a lot of laughs from autistic children and two groups of nonautistic children (matched on chronological age, and matched according to vocabulary test age equivalents). Laughs were elicited in a 10-minute \"laugh assessment sequence\" in which \"an examiner playfully interacted with each child.\" The results? Autistics laughed just as much as nonautistics. The sole difference between autistic and nonautistic laughs was in proportion of voiced laughs. While on average, 97% of autistic children's \"laugh episodes\" were voiced, only 63% and 47% (age-equivalent and chronological age groups respectively) of nonautistic children's laughs were voiced. And about half the autistic children produced  only  voiced laughs.  You can find some autistic and nonautistic laughs  here . In their discussion, Hudenko et al. put forward this view: ...children with autism routinely produce fewer types of laughs than typically developing children because their laughter is more closely linked to their internal experience of positive affect. If this is so, then the autistic children in this study expressed more positive emotion--more genuine happy affect--in interacting with another person than did the nonautistic children. Hudenko et al. also refer to  an earlier study  which found, in the typical population, more positive responses to voiced versus unvoiced laughter. Nonautistics  prefer  voiced laughter. Given  prevailing standards in the autism literature  (arising from  prevalent standards of autism advocacy ), no one should be surprised at how Hudenko et al. interpret their findings. The authors imply, in the absence of any evidence in this direction, that all this happy, genuine, engaging autistic laughter is unlikely to be socially \"appropriate.\" Unfortunately, according to the authors, autistics \"are not using laughter in a socially subtle manner.\" And here is the paper's unfounded concluding sentence: In fact, by using laughter in a less social manner it may be that this expressive pattern actually contributes to the social deficits exhibited by children with autism instead of serving to facilitate connections with others.  But the story doesn't quite end there. I ran into Dr Hudenko at IMFAR because he and one of his colleagues had a poster (abstract is  here ), a follow-up of sorts. In this new and as yet unpublished study, recordings of voiced and unvoiced autistic and nonautistic laughs were played for 135 nonautistic college-aged students. The students were asked to rate their \"affective response\" to each laugh on a scale from strongly negative to strongly positive. In a different task, the students were asked whether each recorded laugh came from an autistic or nonautistic child.  The results? The students rated their responses to autistic laughs as being significantly more positive than their responses to nonautistic laughs. Interestingly, this held true even when voicing--whether laughs were voiced or unvoiced--was accounted for. And when asked to do so, the nonautistic students could tell autistic and nonautistic laughs apart. The students performed above chance on this task, while only about one-fifth of them believed they could make this distinction.  So Hudenko et al. (in press) contend that autistics' way of laughing is defective and detrimental--a presumed contributor to autistics' presumed social deficits. This in turn implies that ideally, autistics would not have such engagingly positive, genuine and distinctive laughs, and instead should have the only \"right\" kind of laughter, the kind which characterizes nonautistics. But according to Dr Hudenko's IMFAR follow-up study, \"improving\" autistics this way would result in their laughter being  less  preferable to nonautistics than is currently the case.

{"date": "Monday, April 27, 2009", "body": "\nDear Ms Svoboda, I've read  your article  about the so-called \"autism culture movement,\" something I am not involved in. In this article my actions are falsely characterized then commented on. At no point was I contacted or interviewed.  Apart from placing me in a movement I don't belong to, and falsely characterizing me as a \"crusader,\" you misrepresent both the nature of  Auton  and my role in it. In  Auton  at the Supreme Court of Canada, I opposed both sides, and both sides opposed my intervention.  My position in  Auton  was about autistic people in Canada who, like me, have not received ABA-based interventions starting very early in life (for many reasons, including that we are too old). This would be most autistic people in Canada. Both sides in  Auton , as well as the lower court decisions,  dehumanized and wrote off this majority of autistics  as doomed, as undeserving of consideration as human beings with human rights, and as belonging not in families or society but in institutions.  My stated role in  Auton  at the SCC was as one autistic person. Through the lower courts and up to the Supreme Court of Canada, both sides in  Auton , as well as the lower court judges, agreed that not one autistic person should have a say in the proceedings--proceedings which engaged Canada's highest law, our Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Starting before the  Auton  SCC hearing in 2004, I made my position in  Auton  fully public,  posting online all relevant documents . My intervention was based on the lower court decisions, the 5,000-page evidentiary record, and the applications, responses, replies, and/or written and oral arguments of the parties and other interveners. That is, I was responding to the case as it existed as a Charter case (engaging Canada's highest law, our Charter of Rights and Freedoms), not to some generic demand for ABA services. As with interventions by others in many other cases, the purpose of my intervention was to provide the Court with information it did not already have. The SCC decision was not based on my intervention but on the  failure of the  Auton  parents to make their case . The premise of the  Auton  parents was that all \"medically necessary\" services in Canada are publicly funded for everyone, but this premise is false. Because of this and other major errors on their part, the  Auton  parents lost. My intervention is mentioned in the SCC decision (though not very accurately), so it was likely influential in some way, possibly in alerting the Court that the two sides in this case--which entirely agreed with each other in excluding, dehumanizing and writing off autistics--were not the whole story.  In your article it is falsely and uncritically assumed that US and Canadian laws and ABA-related legal issues are the same. This is not the case. The way laws have been used in ABA litigation differs by country and has changed across time, with numerous contradictory claims being made (one example  here ). In Canada, ABA litigation has engaged virtually all of Canada's major human rights laws. The legal status of autistics in Canada has been determined almost entirely through ABA litigation and autistics daily live the consequences.  While I have learned a lot since 2004, the basis of my position in  Auton  is still the position I take now. Here it is: 1. Autistics are human beings with human rights. 2. Autistics deserve to benefit from and be protected by recognized standards of science and ethics, including professional ethics. These are the standards that automatically protect and benefit nonautistics, and without which they could not proceed safely in society, much less have good outcomes. 3. Services for autistics, whatever those services may be, should be asked for accurately (with respect to the existing scientific literature), ethically, and respectfully.  That's all. In Canada, those demanding ABA services have been unable or unwilling to do so accurately, ethically and respectfully. They could have chosen otherwise. For example, they could have chosen to take the position that autistics deserve recognized standards of science and ethics. If they had, Canada would be a much different--better and safer--place for autistics.  My experience in human rights cases arises not from anything remotely related to the \"autism culture movement\" or any \"crusade\" as you falsely claim, but from my error in disclosing my diagnosis to my employer. This not only destroyed my (long, exemplary--according to my employer) blue collar career, it put me in danger. It took almost ten years and a lot of legal work to mitigate some of the damage.  I recently  won the first autism-related case referred to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for a hearing . Because of jurisprudence arising from ABA litigation in Canada, particularly  Auton , and how this  enshrined legal status of autistics has influenced the Tribunal , I had to ask the Tribunal to rule on whether autistics were regarded as human under the Canadian Human Rights Act. This was not \"crusading,\" as you misrepresent it, much less anything related to any supposed \"autism culture movement.\" The numerous actions taken by my employer in response to knowing I was autistic were so extreme (though they are typical of how autistics--the majority of us who have not undergone ABA programs starting early in life--are regarded and treated in Canada), I did not have much choice.  I've gone on to take the risk of testing my ideas about autism via peer-review, and to show what an uneducated autistic (who has the behaviours and lacks the basic skills routinely invoked to scare people about autism) can contribute to autism research, given the opportunity. My  publication record is nothing special , but it is not too bad for someone who has never attended university as a student, who has truly spectacular day-to-day difficulties, and who has been written off numerous times.  I disagree with many of the statements made about ABA-based autism interventions in your article--on both supposed \"sides.\" I have criticized as inadequate, inaccurate and harmful many of the popular criticisms of ABA-based autism interventions. I disagree with ASAN's overall position about ABA, which in many areas is poorly informed and ignores the major underlying issue of quality of intervention research. At the same time, ABA as an approach to autism has been defended by its promoters as though  it were an ideology , as  sacrosanct and above scrutiny and criticism . ABA is supposed to be a field of science. The poverty of how ABA-based interventions have been both criticized and defended demonstrates the poor standards of science and ethics that are routinely promoted as what autistics deserve. If you asked, I would tell you that  \"cultural phenomenon\" views of autism have been harmful to autistics , detracting from crucial issues of basic human rights and standards. You won't find \"neurotypical\" much less \"curebie\" in my writing, and I sometimes disagree with ASAN's public positions and recommendations (for example, with respect to ABA-based autism interventions and autism research priorities). I have never claimed to represent other autistics, unless individual autistics have specifically given me this privilege.  At the very basic level where I function, representation is beside the point. The issues that matter involve attempts, by those promoting ABA-based interventions and others similar, to remove the basic human rights of autistics (for example, those of us who have not undergone ABA programs starting early in life), and to deny us recognized standards of science and ethics. Anyone is free to deny their own basic human rights, and to deny themselves the basic standards that exist to protect and benefit everyone. But denying basic human rights and basic standards to others is another story.  I wrote virtually nothing about \"neurodiversity\" until  those unfamiliar with my work  persistently associated me with it. In response I defined neurodiversity as part of the general idea that disabled people should have human rights--mainstream and noncontroversial except when the disabled people are autistic. I suspect people on both supposed \"sides\" disagree with this definition, but I don't have a \"side,\" much less a \"crusade\" and do not have what it takes to be part of any \"movement\" much less a cultural one.  The  standards currently applied to autistics  are such that you are free to misrepresent me, and major legal decisions and issues, and so on, all you want. There's nothing I can do except put accurate information on the record, again, even though it has been here all along, for anyone who takes autism seriously.

{"date": "Saturday, May 02, 2009", "body": "\n Last year, the British Academy and Royal Society held a two-day discussion meeting called \" Autism and Talent \" which became the basis for a recently published wide-ranging  special issue of the journal Philosophical Transactions B .  Francesca Happ\u00e9 and Uta Frith, who organized the discussion meeting,  write in the special issue's editorial  that although \"the association of autism with special talent, sometimes at the highest level, cannot be denied\" it remains true that \"special talents are still less researched and less well understood than other features of autism.\" The long-standing lack of interest in what autistics do well is understated. For example, the commonly reported estimate that 10% of autistics have savant abilities dates back to a book chapter, involving an informal parent survey, published more than 30 years ago. If anything, the \"Autism and Talent\" special issue highlights the current, ongoing state of ignorance about the strong abilities that have been noted in autistics from the outset (Kanner, 1943; Asperger, 1944/1991; Scheerer et al., 1945).  In their special issue paper, Pat Howlin and her colleagues use very conservative methods to find exceptional skills in about one-third of a group of autistics originally diagnosed between 1950 and 1985. While noting this is \"likely to be an underestimate,\" the authors can only ask, about the \"particularly high\" \"rate of such unusual talents or skills\" in autism,  \"Why?\"  Sixty-some years after unusual autistic abilities were first highlighted in the literature, their extent, nature,  and importance remain strikingly neglected as subjects of research. This neglect and consequent ignorance is evident in the special issue. Throughout questions are raised that have long been deemed unimportant or irrelevant and so have largely gone unasked never mind unanswered. In her paper, Pamela Heaton illuminates the price autistics pay for this long history of willful neglect and ignorance. She points to fascinating new evidence about autistics' advantage in perceiving musical timbre, adding to a wide body of work showing enhanced auditory pitch processing in autism. She shows that autistics \"who do not meet criteria for savant skills... nevertheless possess considerable, but often unexploited, musical potential.\" And she concludes that autistics are being denied opportunities to develop their strong interests and abilities.  Our paper in the special issue (Mottron et al., 2009) proposes ways in which autistics' measurably atypical cognitive processes may--given the opportunity--lead to the development of savant abilities, which we see as autistic expertise. Again we have to note the fall-out from researchers' long-standing indifference to how autistics learn well: However, it must also be acknowledged that the information autistics require in order to choose and generalize any given interest is likely to be atypical in many respects (in that this may not be the information that non-autistics would require), and may not be freely or at all available. In addition, the atypical ways in which autistics and savants learn well have attracted little interest and are as yet poorly studied and understood, such that we remain ignorant as to the best ways in which to teach these individuals (Dawson et al. 2008). Therefore, a failure to provide autistics or savants with the kinds of information and opportunities from which they can learn well must also be considered as explaining apparent limitations in the interests and abilities of savant and non-savant autistics This account is in keeping with the failure of researchers to find consistent predictors of outcome among the characteristics of autistic individuals on which researchers have concentrated their attention (Howlin, 2005).  Kate Plaisted Grant and her colleague Greg Davis highlight in their paper, as we do in ours, how profoundly atypical autistic minds are. They conclude there is much to gain, for autistics and nonautistics, in acknowledging, understanding and encouraging autistics' strong abilities: Research such as that described here makes this important point: savant abilities are relatively rare, but the skills observed in individuals with ASCs [autistic spectrum conditions] in many studies are common among the population with ASCs. These skills need as much training and encouragement as is given to any individual with talent in detailed processing, mathematics, engineering, design and so on. With such dedicated training, society, business and industry will reap the great benefits of the unusual minds of individuals with ASCs. The \"Autism and Talent\" discussion meeting and special issue, as well as a more recent  British Academy and Royal Society panel discussion  on the same subject, are small steps in the right direction. For much too long, autistics' strong abilities have been prejudicially regarded and treated as  aberrant and dysfunctional excesses and deficits, which only impede the acquisition of socially-valued typical behaviours . Sixty-some years on, long overdue recognition of the importance of autistics' strong abilities is finally emerging. So is interest in how these abilities might be encouraged--rather than eliminated.

An autistic child \"should not have been left, even briefly and for the best of motives, alone in a small room from which she could not get out.\" Melanie-Rose's mother is quoted as saying: \"I know that despite what anyone says, regardless of their disability, you don't treat children like this.

But Giles, a Westborough resident, is probably that student's best chance for a quality education. Giles teaches at the New England Center for Children on Route 9 in Southborough, a school that is at the forefront of educating children with autism, a neurological disorder that dramatically inhibits the way a child learns. \"We don't want to be the biggest program for autism,\" said Judy Cunniff Serio, director of administration. \"We want to be the best.\" \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1160832/Torment-autistic-girl-teacher-shut-tiny-room-naughty.html", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/4965405/Autistic-girl-shut-in-cramped-room-after-getting-upset-at-school.html", "http://www.boston.com/news/education/k_12/articles/2007/08/09/school_expands_on_mission_to_aid_autistic_children/", "http://www.boston.com/news/education/k_12/articles/2007/08/09/school_expands_on_mission_to_aid_autistic_children/"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2009/03/autistic-children-in-small-windowless.html", "title": "\n"},

The findings: autism prevalence of ~19/10,000 and autistic spectrum prevalence of ~53/10,000 (of which only ~2/10,000 Asperger individuals were identified). Because case finding methods were very conservative and limited, the authors state that: These prevalence estimates should be considered minimum prevalence. Even so, these figures are  similar to recent reports from the United Kingdom and the United States.  For example, the combined Chakrabarti and Fombonne (2001, 2005) studies reported autism prevalance of ~19/10,000 and autistic spectrum prevalence of ~61/10,000. Very similar figures from the UK were recently found by Williams et al. (2008). In fact the reported minimum autistic spectrum prevalence in Aruba is noticeably similar to reported autistic spectrum prevalence in the Faroe Islands (~56/10,000; Ellefsen et al., 2007).  I am no climatologist, but all available reports converge on Aruba, which sits not too far from the equator, being a  remarkably sunny and dry place . This is not the case for the Faroe Islands, which have a  cloudy, rainy, foggy climate where sunshine is rare .  Speculation that lack of sun exposure may cause autism via Vitamin D deficiency is  back in the media , providing a reminder that Michael Waldman and his Cornell colleagues persist  in claiming that less precipitation means fewer autistics .

Here is the information People First provides with their black and yellow ribbon pins: We wear these ribbons to let Canadians know that too many people are still locked in institutions.  We are horrified that Canadians keep institutions open. We are angry that new kinds of institutions are being built.  The  black ribbon  is because people in institutions are not safe. Many have died. We mourn their deaths.  The  yellow ribbon  is for liberation--we want all people in institutions to step into freedom. All people regardless of the severity of their disabilities should live in the community with the support they need. Here is how  People First defines institutions : An institution is any place in which people who have been labelled as having an intellectual disability are isolated, segregated and/or congregated. An institution is any place in which people do not have, or are not allowed to exercise control over their lives and their day to day decisions. An institution is not defined merely by its size. Meanwhile, autism advocacy leaders in Canada have long insisted that autistics  just naturally belong in institutions , a view which in consequence is  enshrined in Canadian jurisprudence , under Canada's highest law: Unless their condition is successfully treated, almost all autistic children are doomed to a life of physical, emotional, social, and intellectual isolation and eventual institutionalization - a tragic outcome for the children, their families, and society. Here \"successfully treated\" means undergoing unlimited ABA-based autism interventions starting very early in life. Most autistics in Canada cannot meet this requirement, ergo autism advocates claim there is no choice except to lock us in institutions for our own good and the good of society. Canada's most powerful autism advocacy organization, FEAT (also known as \"Medicare for Autism Now!\"), adds that we must  live in restraints and have our teeth pulled .  Canadian Senator Jim Munson,  who has publicly supported FEAT , has used his power and influence to make it widely known  that autistics' natural place  is not in society or communities or families or the workplace but  in institutions . Like other leading autism advocacy organizations and individuals, Senator Munson is insulting and undermining the very important hard work and achievements of People First.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://therunman.blogspot.com/2009/04/world-autism-awareness-day-2009.html", "http://www.peoplefirstofcanada.ca/deinstitutionalization_en.php", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_fac.html", "http://medicareforautismnow.blogspot.com/2008/05/medicare-for-autism-now-ontario-tour.html", "http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&hl=en-GB&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4DACA_en-GBCA250CA250&q=%22jim+munson%22+institution+autism"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2009/04/definitely-not-autism-advocacy-people.html", "title": "\n"},

The reason for this was that the child had previously been given a diagnosis of PDD-NOS or Asperger\u2019s and had continued to improve so that symptoms were fewer or milder than they had been. It was considered to be counterproductive to give the parents a more severe diagnosis when the child had actually shown significant improvement, and in many cases, the symptoms were present but in relatively mild form.    (Kelley et al., 2006) Indeed, in some ways, children with AS [Asperger syndrome] are  more  severe than those with autism as the discrepancy between their intellectual potential and their actual adaptation in terms of socialization  and communication is so very marked; they look so \"normal\" but their behavior is so \"odd.\" There is also some evidence that adolescents with AS have more symptoms of anxiety and depression than do children with autism (Szatmari et al., 1989), although the mechanism for this finding may only be that they have the ability to communicate their distress more readily. In this context, they have the more  severe  disorder because they have better communcation skills. It all depends on what dimension of severity one is talking about.

{"date": "Monday, February 02, 2009", "body": "\n Michael Ganz of Harvard has published two papers about the costs of autism, a  book chapter in 2006  and a  peer-reviewed paper in 2007 . Media attention followed, including a  2007 Globe and Mail story  under the headline \"Autism a lifelong burden, study shows.\"  Dr Ganz's work was embraced by leading autism advocates in Canada, as evidence that unlimited ABA-based autism interventions must be funded by governments, or else staggering costs to society will ensue. Here is leading autism advocate Harold Doherty,  writing in 2007 in response to Dr Ganz's work : \"In Canada the courageous parents who litigated the Connor Auton case started telling government over a decade ago that the financial burden to society down the road would be tremendous if early ABA intervention was not provided intensively right away and funded.\" Here is Senator Jim Munson, leading autism advocate,  as reported by CBC, also in 2007 : \"Not providing ABA treatment is more expensive because it involves respite care, group homes and institutionalization, said Munson, who referred to a Harvard University study that put the annual cost of autism to Canada's economy at $3.5 billion.\" Senator Munson  again, from a 2007 speech : \"A recent study by Harvard University demonstrates that each child in the U.S. with autism will cost society about $3.2 million in medical and non-medical costs over his or her lifetime [1]. With the rising number of diagnoses of autism, the eventual costs will be staggering. We're in a situation where spending on treatment, even expensive treatment, is actually a savings.\"  The footnote [1] is to Dr Ganz's 2006 book chapter, and the sole treatment referred to by Senator Munson, as \"proven to work,\" is ABA-based intensive intervention.  FEAT in Canada, which is also called \"Medicare for Autism Now,\" is a powerful autism advocacy lobby group. FEAT demands that Lovaas-type ABA be mandated as medically necessary treatment for autism under the Canada Health Act. Here is  FEAT in 2008 : \"AUTISM is a North American health care epidemic of staggering proportions... The costs to the Canadian economy of NOT treating autism is $3.5 billion a year... the cost in human suffering is immeasurable.\"  While FEAT makes no direct reference to Dr Ganz's work, the $3.5 billion figure does not come from any existing Canadian study. According to the CBC, Senator Munson also used this figure and attributed it to Dr Ganz, and indeed this figure shows up in the  Globe and Mail story  about Dr Ganz's work that I referred to above. Dr Ganz's published work about the costs of autism does not make any mention of Canada, but Canada's leading autism advocates have apparently embraced an estimate based on Dr Ganz's US work and published only in a newspaper.  In any case, the premise of these leading Canadian autism advocates is the same. First, they use Dr Ganz's work as an occasion to unscientifically deny the existence of older autistics. Like  many autism advocacy signature positions , this is an excellent way to ensure that many autistics will have very difficult lives and will be unlikely to have good outcomes. But Dr Ganz's work, if you read it,  assumes a high, stable rate of autism.  Second, leading Canadian autism advocates cite Dr Ganz's work as evidence that government funding for ABA-based autism interventions is the only way to avoid the staggering costs of autism.  In the paper reporting his methodology, Dr Ganz does write about the costs of behavioural interventions for autism. From the \"Behavioral Therapies\" section of Ganz (2006): \"Although it is not completely clear how effective different types of behavioral interventions are for children with autism, it is rather well accepted that some type of intervention should be initiated. Because their use is becoming more pervasive and as more states are legislating that behavioral therapies become covered services as part of health insurance plans, their costs are included here.\" Then Dr Ganz goes on to describe the possible benefits of these interventions: \"However, as the estimates of effectiveness, and hence the financial and nonfinancial benefits, are controversial and because the correspondence between improvement in symptoms and the costs of these interventions are not clear, only the costs of the intervention are enumerated here and are not offset by potential benefits.\" Dr Ganz provides a range of references to support the above statements. The upshot is that according to Dr Ganz's model, existing evidence for the effectiveness of behavioural interventions in autism is insufficient for any conclusion that these interventions have benefits, financial or otherwise. Instead, there is only sufficient evidence to conclude that these interventions have costs. This is the model on which Dr Ganz's 2007 paper is based, as is directly stated in the paper.  So autism advocates who promoted Dr Ganz's work about the costs of autism in reality promoted a study whose author concluded that the effectiveness of ABA-based autism interventions has not yet been established, such that no benefits for this kind of intervention can be claimed. As  often   happens , the question arises as to whether autism advocates read the study and misrepresented it, or did not bother to read it and made public claims about it anyway. Those who are not enamored with autism advocacy standards, and who are genuinely concerned about the future of autistics, will take the trouble to read the primary sources and will draw their own conclusions.

{"date": "Monday, January 26, 2009", "body": "\n When it comes to behaviour analytic approaches to autism, the paper that started it all, and set the tone for what was to come, was Fuller (1949), the first published report of operant conditioning in a human being.  Fuller opens his paper by noting that classical conditioning had been tested in \"normal and subnormal\" humans. For example, it had been found that \"subnormal\" children formed conditioned responses to shock faster than \"normal\" children. But so far, operant conditioning had only been tested in animals (\"infra-humans\"). Fuller was given permission--no mention of by whom--to experiment on a person he described as an 18 year old \"vegetative idiot\" incarcerated in a \"feeble-minded institution.\"  This person, referred to as \" S ,\" is reported never to move his trunk or legs, though no reason is given for this. According to Fuller,  S  had limited movement of his head, shoulders and arms, but couldn't roll over or change his position from where he was left lying on his back all day.  S  was never given solid food; liquids and semi-solids were \"stuffed into his mouth,\" Fuller reports, while  S  coughed and choked. While Fuller writes that  S  never made any sounds, \"in the course of the experiment vocalizations were heard.\"   Fuller's experiment started by depriving  S  of food for 15 hours. A syringe full of warm milk-sugar solution, which was squirted into the corner of  S 's mouth, was the reinforcer. A bit of this solution was given to  S  when he raised his right arm.  Eventually,  S  was conditioned such that after being deprived of food for five hours, he raised his right arm 19 times in 16 minutes. After this he fell asleep. The next morning, he raised his right arm and opened his mouth simultaneously. And while  S  had earlier also raised his left arm sometimes, by this point, he only raised his right arm. Fuller declared success at this point, and then extinguished this response by removing the food reinforcer. The extinction procedure took 70 minutes, at which point  S  stopped raising his right arm. This completed the experiment. Fuller wrote about  S : \"An interesting feature of this study is the example it affords of phylogenetic overlap. While of normal human parentage, this organism was, behaviorally speaking, considerably lower in the scale than the majority of infra-human organisms used in conditioning experiments--dogs, rats, cats.\" The physicians in the institution in which  S  had been an inmate (this word is used) for a year had reported to Fuller that  S  had not, in all his 18 years, learned anything at all. Fuller simply accepted this as true, even though he had no relevant information about  S 's history and minimal information about  S 's present. This allowed Fuller, and  many behaviour analysts to follow , to be very impressed with what Fuller accomplished in conditioning  S . After all, Fuller is reported to have trained a vegetative organism to move, a stunning and unprecedented achievement.  Along these lines, here is Fuller's conclusion: \"For years, many psychologists have experimented exclusively with infra-human [subjects], and they have expressed a preference for the simple, less variable behavior of the lower organisms in the laboratory. Perhaps by beginning at the bottom of the human scale the transfer from rat to man can be effected.\" Fuller's \"classic\" paper, a landmark in the history of ABA, resonates with the much  later words of Ivar Lovaas and his colleagues , about autistic human beings: \"You see, you start pretty much from scratch when you work with an autistic child. You have a person in the physical sense\u2014they have hair, a nose and a mouth\u2014but they are not people in the psychological sense. One way to look at the job of helping autistic kids is to see it as a matter of constructing a person. You have the raw materials, but you have to build the person.\"   (from an interview with Chance, 1974) \"In any case, what one usually sees when first meeting an autistic child who is 2, 3, or even 10 years of age is a child who has all the external physical characteristics of a normal child\u2014that is, he has hair, and he has eyes and he has a nose, and he may be dressed in a shirt and trousers\u2014but who really has no behaviors that one can single out as distinctively \u2018human\u2019. The major job then, for a therapist\u2014whether he's behaviorally oriented or not\u2014would seem to be a very intriguing and significant one, namely, the creation or construction of a truly human behavioral repertoire where none exists.\"   (Lovaas & Newsom, 1976) \"To use another analogy, at the beginning of treatment, the children may be regarded as having close to a tabula rasa. In this sense they can be considered very young persons, as persons with little or no experience, presenting the teacher with the task of building a person where little had existed before.\"  (Lovaas & Smith, 1989)   \"Instead, the fascinating part for me was to observe persons with eyes and ears, teeth and toenails, walking around yet presenting few of the behaviors one would call social or human. Now, I had the chance to build language and other social and intellectual behaviors where none had existed, a good test of how much help a learning-based approach could offer.\"   (Lovaas, 1993) The currently predominant autism advocacy policy position that autistics  can't learn, develop, communicate, progress ,  etc ., or  become   human , except via ABA programs, reminds me of  assumptions behaviour analysts have made  about the nature of Fuller's  S . They just know, like Fuller did, that  S  had never learned anything at all until Fuller came along. Fuller needed no evidence for this, or any information about  S 's past. He just knew there were subhumans in human form, including vegetative human organisms who were lower in the scheme of things than rats (and were treated as such). So all he had to do was to never, ever question any of this, and then go out and find one of these vegetative organisms and experiment on him. And so Fuller became famous, just like Dr Lovaas did later for \"building\" human behaviours in autistic children who he claimed had none at all, for \"building\" a person where he claimed none existed.

But my question is about bloggers who are also autism researchers. Where are they? Prominent academics, scientists and researchers who blog aren't hard to find, including  Nobel  and  Fields Medal  winners,  major journal editors , and  clumpings   together  of well-known figures in various areas of research. You can't go far in  Science Blogs  without colliding with NIH-funded researchers in various non-autism fields.  And there are many bloggers who blog about autism research, including researchers, clinicians and academics in non-autism areas. But I'm looking for autism researchers who blog, about any subject, but particularly about autism research. For my blog-searching purposes, \"autism researchers\" are those whose main field of research is autism and whose autism-related work has been published in peer-reviewed journals.  Apart from me, there is the postdoctoral fellow  Lindsay Oberman , who  sporadically blogs at Psychology Today . Back in 2006, New Scientist published  a letter I wrote in response  to an informal article  authored by Dr Oberman . Michael Merzenich has been in the authorship of a few autism-related papers and also has a  blog , but he has extensively published in non-autism areas and is not primarily known as an autism researcher.  The Hub blogger and behaviour analyst  Interverbal  promises to cough up some published research some day, for which I'm impatiently waiting. There are now other behaviour analysts who blog about autism, but those I have located are service providers, rather than researchers.  In the remarkably science-and evidence-free vaccines-cause-autism camp, there's Mark Blaxill, known for calling autism a \" silent holocaust .\" Mr Blaxill has been in the authorship of a few published papers, and is the sole author of a 2004 review in which he beautifully demonstrated--without in the least noticing--that amount of thimerosal in routine childhood vaccinations is totally unrelated to prevalence of autism. Autism Diva was kind enough to  give me the space to point out the obvious . Mr Blaxill blogs with his ilk at \"Age of Autism,\" but who would call him an autism researcher?  So where are they, the autism researcher bloggers, and if there really are so few of us, why might this be? There is no shortage of researchers in the area of autism, and autism has been a high profile field for longer than there have been blogs. I've limited my blog reading to English-language blogs, and I've left out individuals who are involved in autism research but who haven't yet published any of this research in the peer-reviewed literature. So maybe my criteria are too limited. But where are--for example--any of the numerous well-known autism researchers I've seen at IMFAR year after year? Why aren't any of them bloggers? Can anyone point me to more autism researcher bloggers?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/", "http://terrytao.wordpress.com/", "http://network.nature.com/people/henrygee/blog", "http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/", "http://network.nature.com/blogs", "http://scienceblogs.com/", "http://tmslab.org/faculty/?page_id=15&id=83&add_title=Lindsay+Oberman", "http://blogs.psychologytoday.com/authors/lindsay-m-oberman-phd", "http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025540.500-missing-persons.html", "http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025516.700-autism-the-search-for-steven.html", "http://merzenich.positscience.com", "http://interverbal.blogspot.com/", "http://www.vaccinationnews.com/DailyNews/May2002/LettersToTime.htm", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2005/06/rfk-jr-and-mark-blaxill-are-just.html"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2009/01/where-are-autism-researcher-bloggers.html", "title": "\n"},

ASA is part of  a collaboration  of organizations which agree that there has been an epidemic of autism caused at least in part by vaccines.  Dr Granpeesheh is  executive director  of CARD (Center for Autism and Related Disorders), a high-profile organization which provides ABA services. CARD has recently started a blog, which apparently has gotten rave reviews from leading Canadian autism advocates (you know where to find them...). Of the few CARD blog posts I read, two gave me d\u00e9ja vu.  One is  about ABA  (see also  the CARD website ), and the other is  about autism  (see also  the CARD website ). Just at a  glance, chunks of this writing are taken, without attribution, from the unrefereed  MADSEC report , published in 2000. I also spotted an unattributed piece from the  US Surgeon General's report , released in 1999. And that's only at a glance, which is all the time this is worth.  As I briefly showed in a presentation this year, pieces of the MADSEC report have often been copied without attribution, including by behaviour analysts--a practice that continues up to the present. So it seems those frequently copied, but infrequently attributed, \"30 years\" and \"several thousand published research studies\" that have \"documented the effectiveness of ABA\" haven't budged an iota in a decade. The MADSEC report covers papers published up to 1998; among those \"several thousand published research studies,\" which sadly are not listed, not one single RCT of ABA-based autism interventions is cited.  Failing to attribute copied chunks of text may result in applause from leading autism advocates, and for all I know it may be good for business. But in my view, if you are going to copy someone else's writing, and put it on your website or blog, it's a very good idea to provide the source for this writing rather than passing it off as your own. This is true even if copyright is not an issue, and even if you have permission to copy someone else's work.

{"date": "Thursday, January 15, 2009", "body": "\n The MIND's recently published autism epidemiology ( Hertz-Picciotto & Delwiche, 2009 ) has been widely publicized (press release is  here , typical media story is  here ), with the upshot that large increases in reported rates of autism are real rather than apparent and should be studied as such.  Bloggers have taken on several aspects of the MIND's new autism epidemiology ( here ,  here ,  here ,  here , with more and a summary  here ) as well as discrepancies between the paper itself  and how it has been promoted . I'm going to add just a few more points to consider.  This isn't the MIND's first crack at epidemiology. Their previous  highly publicized but unrefereed report , described as \"A Comprehensive Pilot Study,\" was shown, in a refereed paper  (Gernsbacher et al., 2005 ), to suffer from \"unwarranted conclusions\" about the effect of changes in how autism is diagnosed on reported rates of autism.  So what's new, this time around? Hertz-Picciotto and Delwiche use census data to account for migration into California, so as to generate what they call incidence (rather than prevalence) figures. Also, they've included individuals identified as autistic, for the purpose of receiving services, before age three.  But the basis for the MIND's new epidemiology remains the same: the California DDS data. Turning DDS figures into incidence data doesn't alter the problem that DDS-type administrative numbers should not be used as epidemiology. The pitfalls of using service-based numbers have been explored formally in the literature (e.g.,  Laidler, 2005 ;  Gernsbacher et al., 2005 ) and expressed less formally by an  NIH official : \"I'll call a kid a zebra if it will get him the educational services I think he needs.\"  Hertz-Picciotto and Delwiche's inclusion of children identified in service records as autistic before age 3 raises the problem that early diagnosis of autism may be very unstable. In  Turner and Stone (2007) , only 53% of children diagnosed autistic at an average age of 29 months kept their autism diagnosis at an average age of 53 months. Diagnostic instability was related to earliness of diagnosis (the earlier the diagnosis, the less stable it was) but unrelated to interventions received.  Like Hertz-Picciotto and Delwiche's conclusions about changes in diagnostic criteria (pulled from an unrelated Finnish prevalence study;  Kielinen et al., 2000 ), their conclusions about effect of including other autistic spectrum diagnoses (Asperger's and PDD-NOS, which the authors presume are \"milder cases\") do not arise from the incidence data they report. Instead, figures were taken from an earlier paper involving a specific (much smaller and narrower) sample of children recruited to study environmental causes of autism ( Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2006) .  According to Hertz-Picciotto and Delwiche, their study involves children with the specific diagnosis of autism only. The authors refer to \"an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code of 299.0 (autistic disorder)\" (except of course this is a DSM-IV, not ICD, code and category), while assuming that children diagnosed with other autistic spectrum diagnoses do not meet ADI-R or ADOS cut-offs for autism or ASD (ADI-R has autism cut-offs only). This, the premise of the authors' analysis re what they presume to be \"milder cases,\" doesn't stand up well to scrutiny.  For example, in  Baird et al. (2006) , 69% of children with non-autism autistic spectrum diagnoses met autism criteria on the ADI-R. This doesn't count Asperger children, who were lumped in with autistic children, virtually all (98%) meeting ADI-R autism criteria. In work I'm involved in, virtually all Asperger individuals (as virtually all autistics) meet all ADI-R and ADOS cut-offs for autism.  Also, in using the ADOS ( which has, more recently, been revised again ) and ADI-R, as well as clinical experience,  Baird et al. (2006)  produced a range of prevalence figures for children aged 9-10, from ~25/10,000  to ~116/10,000. That's a 4.6-fold discrepancy in the same sample at the same time with the same instruments and the same group of diagnosing clinicians.  Maybe there are other ways of exploring whether children receiving DDS autism services in the past are similar to children receiving these services more recently. In their  unrefereed 2002 report , the MIND compared subsamples of children born from 1983 to 1985 with children born from 1993 to 1995. In the earlier subsample, 61% were judged to be in the range of intellectual disability, whereas in the later subsample, 27% were--a discrepancy noted by  Gernsbacher et al. (2005) .  More data about the entire population receiving DDS autism services are available. In a  1999 DDS report , graphed data show that whereas in 1987, ~84% of those receiving DDS autism services were judged to be in the range of intellectual disability, by 1998 that figure was 58%. A further look at  DDS quarterly reports  shows that by the beginning of 2002, that figure was 42%, and by the end of 2007 it was 33%. Between 1987 and 2007, the proportion of individuals receiving DDS autism services and scoring in the severe and profound ranges of intellectual disability dropped from ~36% to ~6%.  So--there are a few more reasons to question Hertz-Picciotto and Delwiche's conclusions about the effect of differences in how autism is defined and diagnosed. Also, there are many reasons to question the whole enterprise of trotting out DDS numbers yet again and pretending that, with enough distracting decorations stuck on, they in fact are epidemiology. After all, Hertz-Picciotto and Delwiche are denying the existence of older autistics, and they are doing this by using poor quality data dressed up in definitive conclusions. I would be much more cautious than  Dr Hertz-Picciotto and her university have been , in going out in public wearing the MIND's new epidemiology.

{"date": "Monday, December 29, 2008", "body": "\nHere's a handful of interesting autism-related papers published in 2008, ranging across scales and subjects: 1. Autism and speech: Gernsbacher et al. (2008) Why can't some autistic children speak? The remarkably few existing explanations for this high-profile phenomenon have collapsed under scrutiny. This embarrassing failure on the part of autism researchers was, at long last, addressed in 2008. Dr Gernsbacher and colleagues found \"prominent associations among early oral- and manual-motor skills and later speech fluency\" in a large sample of autistic children, who ranged from highly to minimally fluent. Early oral-motor skills are therefore crucial in explaining why some autistic children can't speak. What's more, associated manual-motor skills should be considered a confound in \"assessing autistic cognition, receptive language, and \u2018nonverbal\u2019 social communication.\"   2. An effective intervention: Tyrer et al. (2008) This was a multi-site RCT of three different interventions targeting \"aggressive challenging behaviour\" in intellectually disabled adults, a minority of whom were autistic. The authors found that haloperidol, risperidone, and placebo all resulted in rapid, dramatic and sustained decrease in the targeted behaviours. And while \"no important differences between the treatments were recorded,\" after four weeks of treatment, \"the greatest decrease was with placebo.\" The conclusion? \"Antipsychotic drugs should no longer be regarded as an acceptable routine treatment for aggressive challenging behaviour in people with intellectual disability.\"   3. Absolute pitch for speech: Heaton et al. (2008) In the past two years, Pamela Heaton and her colleagues have published a series of papers about enhanced perception of speech in autism. This case study goes a step farther in showing exceptional absolute pitch for speech in an autistic adult, AC, who has had little musical training. The authors found that \"AC's naming of speech pitch was highly superior\" compared with nonautistic controls who had absolute pitch--many of whom had extensive musical training. While delayed in his development of speech, AC had gone on to be competent in numerous languages. This calls into question the ubiquitous assumption that enhanced processing of perceptual aspects of speech in autistics can only be detrimental to what are regarded as much more important language abilities.  4. Unsung autism epidemiology: Williams et al. (2008) Autism epidemiology tends to get a lot of media coverage, but this UK study, whose methodology resembles the much-publicized 2007 CDC epi studies, somehow got overlooked. Within \"a large representative population sample\" the authors found a prevalence of autism ranging from 51.5/10,000 (using more stringent standards) to 61.9/10,000 (using more relaxed standards). That's 1 in 194 to 1 in 162, strikingly lower than the  1 in 86 reported in a famous 2006 UK study  involving a slightly older cohort. Within this sample, less than 15% were assessed to be in the range of intellectual disability, with this proportion falling to 13% for those with the specific diagnosis of autism (a higher rate, 27%, was found in those diagnosed with \"atypical autism\"). Also, having an autistic child was not associated with paternal age (a hot subject these days), and was only slightly associated with maternal age. Clearly, these are not the kinds of findings that attract the media, or autism advocates who produce press releases.  5. Rational autistics, irrational researchers: De Martino et al. (2008) This paper gets both honourable and dishonourable mention. The study itself was a great idea, well-executed with important and fascinating findings. Autistics were shown to perform with enhanced logical consistency, avoiding irrational and irrelevant biases that distorted decision-making in their nonautistic controls. However, autistics' enhanced performance in this study was interpreted by the authors as a litany of autistic failures, imbalances, impairments, deficits, reduced capacities, weaknesses, and impoverishments (several invocations of some of these), none of which were actually found. The authors concluded that they have discovered a \"core neurobiological deficit\" in autistics. In years to come, we can look forward to interventions designed to overcome this core autistic deficit and to ensure that autistics become as irrational as nonautistics.

The solitary RCT (where the intended comparison between randomized groups was actually carried out) in the 47-year history of ABA-based autism interventions--a small, largely failed study--is now drowned in an enormous murk of systematic, quasi-systematic, and not-systematic-at-all reviews. At this point in autism and autism advocacy history, no one should be surprised that this phenomenon encompasses dueling meta-analyses.  As with every other Verbatim, providing quotes doesn't mean I agree with them or the papers they are situated in. Here are quotes from the conclusions of three of the 2008 reviews: Intervention studies suffer from methodological problems that preclude definitive conclusions regarding their efficacy. [...] While this review suggests that Lovaas may improve some core symptoms of ASD compared to special education, these findings are based on pooling outcomes from a few, methodologically weak studies with few participants and relatively short-term follow-up. [...] Future studies on the effectiveness of these interventions need to be more rigorous.   (Ospina et al., 2008) Given the few RCT studies, the few models that have been tested, and the large differences in interventions that are being published, it is clear that the field is still very early in the process of determining what kinds of interventions are most efficacious in early autism, the variables that mediate and moderate treatment effects, and the degree of both short-term and long-term improvement that can be expected for an individual child.   (Rogers & Vismara, 2008) Currently there is inadequate evidence that ABI [applied behavioral intervention] has better outcomes than standard care for children with autism. Appropriately powered clinical trials with broader outcomes are required.

{"date": "Monday, December 01, 2008", "body": "\nMurphy et al. (in press) is a recently epublished paper about so-called challenging behaviours in autistic children.  In this study, 106 autistic children (mean age 8.5yrs, range 3-14.2yrs) were receiving intensive (27-35hrs/wk) one-on-one ABA-based interventions (the ABA school group), while 51 children received \"eclectic\" non-ABA autism-specialized services (27-30hrs/wk; the ASD unit children).  Some of these children (109) were judged to be in various ranges of intellectual ability, but this information was gathered by questioning individuals who worked with the children and was not verified in any way. Similarly, there is no information about these children's diagnoses, beyond that they were \"children with autism spectrum disorder,\" and for seven children, even their age was unknown.  All 157 autistic children's challenging behaviours were assessed through a version of the Behavior Problems Inventory (Rojahn et al., 2001; Murphy et al., in press, take their description of this instrument nearly verbatim from this earlier paper). This instrument involves interviewing informants (rather than direct observation) and divides challenging behaviours into three categories: stereotypy, self-injury, and aggression.  Regardless of the reasonable sample size, this study's authors chose to organize their data in ways that made many statistical comparisons useless. There is a clear trend, though, if you slog through what information they do provide. This is summarized in the discussion, about comparisons between children in the ABA school group and children in the non-ABA ASD unit group: With regard to the type of intervention received being a risk factor, findings show that the type of intervention is not related to the prevalence of challenging behavior. However, in relation to participants receiving an ABA intervention, they displayed a higher frequency of stereotypy and also showed higher levels of aggression.  If I adhered to autism advocacy standards, I could simply repeat some or all of this excerpt endlessly as some kind of \"proof\" of what intensive ABA programs accomplish.  But the first sentence in the quote above is not supported by the authors' analyses. The other sentence is accurate in the sense that what is claimed can be traced to statistical comparisons that were actually carried out.  However, these statistical comparisons are within the context of a very poor quality study where the findings, even within the given highly questionable parameters (e.g., definitions of challenging behaviours that, among many other limitations, encompass presumed mental states) are virtually impossible to interpret.  Available data that might assist in interpreting the findings are simply not reported (e.g., demographics of the two different intervention groups). But even were the data better reported, this study is based on an very poorly characterized sample (poor characterization being the standard in the vast ABA literature), and one that according to what scant information is provided, is not representative of autistic children in general.  Indeed, an inventory of the errors (some of them instantly obvious) and major weaknesses in this paper would be lengthy and would include, somewhere down the list, the authors' contention that ABA must have been effective in their study in reducing challenging behaviours in autism because, well, ABA is effective.  This paper was accepted (within two days of being submitted) by an autism journal edited by a famous behaviour analyst. In my view, in its epublished form, this paper contributes nothing reliable or worthwhile to autism research.  What is worthwhile, though, is the reminder that quality and standards matter. The selective reading and promotion of research of overwhelmingly poor quality is central to autism advocacy--is one of its signatures. Autism advocates have successfully insisted that poor quality research is what autistics deserve.  But poor quality research can be selectively invoked to support any position, as I've pointed out here. For example, the low/no standards of science and ethics that autism advocates have imposed on autistics  have led to public funding for RDI . But pushing poor standards and poor quality research is not going to lead to better outcomes for autistics. Claiming otherwise, as autism advocates loudly do, harms autistics.

{"date": "Thursday, December 11, 2008", "body": "\nAccording to my dictionary ( The New Penguin English Dictionary,  2000), a crisis is \"a time of acute difficulty or danger,  esp  on a national or international scale.\" The autism crisis was created by  autism advocates . Thanks to autism advocacy, the existence of autistics is now widely regarded and treated as a  devastating   epidemic --as posing a great and immediate threat to  families, communities, the economy , and  society as we know it .  Crisis creation  has been one of autism advocacy's greatest achievements.  Public policy  is based on this crisis model of autism, in which virtually all autistics are young children who must be saved from the  abyss of autism    right now  in order to save the future of society itself. Because the heroic effort to save autistic children from autism has been and continues to be costly (in many ways), public policy also now often encompasses  the ideal that  autism  should be    prevented .  In this autism-advocacy-created autism crisis, older autistics exist only in the future, as a looming danger to the public good. Unless there is funding for unlimited ABA, autism advocates threaten that an unprecedented epidemic of autistic children will grow up autistic--which means  doomed  (in fact,  rotten ), and  large, violent and destructive , and  institutionalized and horribly expensive . The fact that older autistics, the vast majority of whom have not been in ABA programs starting early in life, have not already destroyed the economy is just proof that  we   don't   actually   exist .  So one question is, when did autism advocates start this autism crisis? Or in other words, how long has this autism crisis been going on? I'd like to know. In a quick look-round, the earliest declaration of an autism crisis I found comes from Cure Autism Now.  CAN claimed there was an autism crisis starting in 2000 , or more than eight years ago: \"Today, autism is a national crisis affecting over 400,000 families and costing the nation over 13 billion dollars a year. According to recent studies, as many as 2 in every 1000 children born today will be on the autistic spectrum.\"  In 2002, Lee Grossman, President and CEO of Autism Society of America, declared that \" autism is an emergency, and it is a national health crisis .\" In the UK, the Guardian declared an  autism crisis  in 2002, and described autistic children as a \"timebomb building in UK schools.\"  A \" Canadian autism crisis \" was declared by Autism Society Canada in 2001, or more than seven years ago. ASC has not at any time declared an end to this autism crisis. Indeed, in  2005  and  2006  this autism crisis was \"growing\" and currently, according to an ASC advisor (who cites a TV program, \"The View,\" as his source), autism is definitely still a  crisis . CAN's successor, Autism Speaks, currently disseminates the claim that autism is \"a national public health crisis\" on every Autism Speaks press release ( this one  is about new Autism Speaks board members, none of whom is identified as autistic: autistics, autistics everywhere, and not a single autistic on the board, or anywhere else in Autism Speaks' leadership).  So apart from asking when this autism-advocacy-created autism crisis started, seeing as it has continued for more than eight years, another question is, when will it end? Or will it end? After all,  creating and perpetuating an autism crisis is a piece of cake . Autism advocates have successfully placed themselves above scrutiny and criticism, such that none of their false claims, no matter how  contradictory  or  outlandish  or  extreme , never mind  harmful    to autistics , is  ever questioned .  Testifying in the senate  some time ago , I pointed out the obvious:  autism advocates have been very successful in their perpetual autism crisis creation. So it is difficult to imagine  any  amount of resources and recognition that would satisfy autism advocates and their demand for a world as  free of autism--of autistic people--as possible . It is unlikely that Canada or any other country has enough resources to meet the urgent and constant demands of autism advocates.  My wild guess is that so long as there are autism advocates, and so long as they dominate public policy and the public discourse about autism, there will continue to be an autism crisis. And this crisis--which is really an autism advocacy crisis--will continue to stand in the way of autistics having good outcomes. Addendum:  Many thanks to a reader who passed along some evidence that the autism crisis was first declared in 1999. See  this ,  this , and  this .

{"date": "Thursday, November 27, 2008", "body": "\nIn a May 2005 press release, Autism Speaks announced that there are \" nearly 2 million people in the United States living with autism .\" More than three and a half years later, Autism Speaks claims that \" 1.5 million Americans may be affected with autism .\"  You would think that  given their goals , Autism Speaks would be celebrating the reported--by Autism Speaks--disappearance of ~500,000 autistics in less than four years. But remarkably, this reported dramatic decline in number of autistics is instead considered by Autism Speaks to represent \" a national public health crisis \" and a \" global epidemic of autism .\" What's more, Autism Speaks currently reports that  \" the rate of autism is rising 10-17 percent annually . Unfortunately, the numbers appear to be continuing their upward climb.\" Autism Speaks' epidemiology is characterized by two overlapping themes. One is an absurdly dishonest and contradictory reporting of the easily-available evidence. The other is a pervasive disrespect for autistics, whose lives Autism Speaks expediently and anti-scientifically denies.  In  a previous post , I quoted a sentence that graces every Autism Speaks press release. Here it is again: The prevalence of autism has increased tenfold in the last decade . In this one widely-distributed sentence, Autism Speaks  grossly misrepresents  the scientific literature; rejects the scientifically sound position that there has been a high, stable rate of autism; and wipes out the lives of 90% of autistics who existed more than 10 years ago.  But this is still not sufficient for Autism Speaks' political purposes. Here are some more Autism Speaks statements about the prevalence of autism: February, 2006 : \"a decade ago... 1 in 10,000\" March, 2006 : \"1 in 10,000 just 13 years ago.\" April 6, 2006 : \"Thirteen years ago only 1 in 10,000\"  March, 2007 :\"1 in 10,000 -- it was 13 years ago\" April, 2007 : \"Fourteen years ago only 1 in 10,000\" May, 2007 : \"it was 1 in 10,000 just 13 years ago\" May, 2007 : \"13 years ago, 1 in 10,000\"  November, 2007 : \"1 in 10,000 just fourteen years ago\" In these statements, Autism Speaks is--at least--also erasing the lives of more than 98% of autistics who existed more than 14 years ago.  While any calculation is of necessity very approximate, if the epidemiology Autism Speaks widely disseminates is taken seriously, then public policy decisions would be based on there being not many more than 300,000 autistics in the US, of whom the vast majority (~270,000) would be young children. A very small number (~14,000) would be older children, and there would be very few (~22,000) autistic adolescents and adults.  And of course this is in total contradiction with Autism Speaks' claim that \" 1.5 million Americans may be affected with autism .\" Meanwhile, a  science-based  estimate would be 2 million autistics in the US, of whom about 500,000 are children (the number of autistic children, ages 0-21, in the US is estimated by the CDC to be  560,000 ). In the  2007 UN resolution about World Autism Awareness Day , a resolution  heavily influenced by Autism Speaks , virtually all autistics are presumed to be children (see also  this message ). There is no mention of autistic adults, just the \"high rate of autism in children,\" and that autism is a disability \"mostly affecting children.\"  Autism Speaks' autism advocacy message is getting around the world: autistics don't deserve the protection and benefit of even minimal standards of science, ethics, and advocacy; and older autistics do not exist and need not be considered.

{"date": "Friday, November 07, 2008", "body": "\n Gender disturbed children desperately need treatment. This quote is from Rekers, Bentler, Rosen & Lovaas (1977). It concludes one of multiple peer-reviewed articles authored by prominent researchers, defending a highly successful early intensive ABA-based treatment (see also Rekers, 1977; Rosen, Rekers & Bentler, 1978; Rekers, Rosen, Lovaas & Bentler, 1978). This treatment was part of the UCLA Feminine Boy Project, which for some time ran concurrently with the UCLA Young Autism Project. Its unprecendented success in treating what was considered to be an intractable pathology was reported by NIH-funded UCLA researchers in peer-reviewed journals (Rekers & Lovaas, 1974; Rekers, Lovaas & Low, 1974). One of the stated purposes of this treatment was to \"cure\" or \"prevent\" homosexuality. The UCLA researchers repeatedly wrote that the young boys targeted by their early intensive ABA-based treatment suffered terribly and were in pain. At all possible levels (physical, emotional, economic, social, etc.), their prognosis was described as \"extremely poor\" with a high risk of criminal, anti-social and self-destructive behaviour. Their future was one of \"numerous crippling difficulties\" and \"pain, misery and despair\" (all quotes from Rekers et al., 1977).  Then there were the parents of these reportedly severely disordered children, parents whose needs, values and goals were considered paramount. Therefore, according to the UCLA researchers, there was a \"moral and ethical obligation\" to intervene and provide a treatment which had been demonstrated to be effective. The fundamental purpose of this behavior analytic treatment was, they wrote,  to help children whose present and future is so filled with hardship that it would be clearly unethical not to render them professional help.   (Rekers et al., 1977)  One of the desperate children who was successfully treated, starting at age 4 (his treatment is described in Rekers & Lovaas, 1974), and who therefore became \"indistinguishable\" from boys judged to be normal and healthy, was interviewed at length when he was 17 and 18. Here are some excerpts from these interviews (in which he is called \"Kyle\"), conducted by Richard Green (\"RG\") and published in Dr Green's book (Green, 1987):  RG: The kind of feeling you had tonight with this guy who was looking at you and made you feel uncomfortable--what other times has that happened to you? Kyle:  I suppose I've been overly sensitive when guys look at me or something ever since I can remember, you know, after my mom told me why I have to go to UCLA because they were afraid I would turn into a homosexual. ..... RG:  I'm sure you're aware that there's a lot of social controversy about homosexuality and whether homosexuals should be allowed to be schoolteachers, should hold public office, have equal opportunity for jobs, housing, the whole civil rights question. How to you feel about that issue? Kyle:  I don't think they should because--well, I believe in God and everything and I think it's a pretty bad thing, and I think that they should try to be helped by whatever, but I think it is pretty bad, and I don't think they should be around to influence children, 'cause children are pretty easy to influence, little kids. RG:  Are you saying that homosexuality is sinful? Kyle:  I suppose it is. I don't think they should be hurt by society or anything like--especially in New York. You have them that are into leather and stuff like that. I mean, I think that is really sick, and I think maybe they should be put away.   .....  RG:  When did you first have a crush on another male? Kyle:  Probably when I was in seventh grade. RG:  What do you remember about the first crush? Kyle:  I didn't like what was happening. RG:  Did it scare you? Kyle:  It did. RG:  Did it surprise you? Kyle:  Not really. RG:  Why not? Kyle:  Because I had been through all the UCLA stuff and all that. So I knew. RG:  Why should the UCLA stuff--? Kyle:  Well, because that was the reason for me to go, so I wouldn't be gay.  ..... (about his first homosexual encounter at age 18)   Kyle:  It wasn't like I was real. And afterwards, a few weeks later, I tried to kill myself. RG:  Tell me about that. Kyle:  I swallowed about fifty aspirins. RG:  Did you really want to die? Kyle:  I think I really wanted to, but I knew I wasn't going to. But I really did want to. RG:  Why? Kyle:  Because I don't want to grow up to be gay. RG:  How strong an influence on your thinking is religious feeling? Kyle:  Not really strong, I don't think. It's pretty strong, but it's more me. I don't want to be that way. But religion is pretty strong too. Because I know it's wrong. RG:  Do you feel it's sinful? Kyle:  Yes. RG:  I'm not sure if I understand whether it's the idea of being gay or the idea that gay people don't live happy lives that's even more-- Kyle:  I think it's both. RG:  It's both. Kyle:  Even if I was gay, I might feel happy and everything, but I know, I would know that it is wrong. I know it would be.  Kyle also states that he would have become a \"total basket case\" if he had not undergone treatment at UCLA. Asked what he would do if one day he was a father and had four year old boy with feminine behaviours, Kyle stated that he would take this child to a place like UCLA for treatment. In the same book, Kyle's mother was interviewed and expressed how thankful she was for the early intensive ABA-based treatment which changed her son's behaviour.  The other young boy, Carl, whose successful ABA-based treatment was reported in the literature, also commented favourably (at age 12) on the treatment he received and its results. From Rekers, Lovaas, and Low (1974): After our behavioral treatment, the two independent psychologists could find no evidence of feminine behavior or identification in Carl's test responses or interview behavior. Not only have family and friends remarked on the change in Carl, but he himself volunteered that he \"used to be a queer, but not anymore.\" The treatment has clearly changed Carl's overt gender-related behaviors, suggesting that his sex-role development may have become normalized. This was in an era where \"queer\" was an unambiguously pejorative word. Carl's parents were also reported to be satisfied; his mother was \"pleased.\" So by all reports, this early intensive ABA-based treatment was a great success for everyone involved. Everyone was reported to be happy about it--the parents who wanted treatment for their children, the boys who underwent treatment, and the behaviour analysts who provided the treatment.  And here again are the original UCLA researchers and their powerful defence of their successful ABA-based treatment:  For example, it has been suggested that the only appropriate goal of the psychotherapist dealing with a homosexual individual is to help him adjust to his homosexual orientation and behavior. Some critics go so far as to suggest that a referral to a \"Gay Counseling Center\" is even more appropriate, with the goal of placing the individual in contact with others like himself. We find this line of argument to be totally unacceptable and irresponsible.   (Rekers et al., 1977)    And:  The non-neutrality of \"gay counseling\" imposes further limitations on the individual's growth potential, and unnecessarily sanctions a debilitating pattern of personal adjustment.   (Rekers et al., 1977)   That is, any action in any direction suggesting acceptance of homosexuality was deemed harmful and unethical. The world would be quite different now, would be comprehensively narrowed and impoverished, if an equivalent to current-day autism advocacy had prevailed, if this reportedly successful ABA-based treatment had not been derailed by serious criticism, including from the legendary behaviour analyst Donald M. Baer (Nordyke et al., 1977). In some of the most important, and most forgotten, writing in the behaviour analytic literature, Dr Baer and his colleagues made this statement: The final reason for treatment was that the boy's parents were concerned. If a therapist takes only this point into consideration, then the therapist has become the parents' agent, rather than the child's, or society's. Can the therapist justify that short-sighted a role? What are the consequences for the field, and for society, if that were to become common practice? It is difficult for a therapist to be fully aware of all the issues involved when changing behaviors defined not by the person whose behavior is in question, but by other agents, such as parents or courts. This is especially true when treatment is not done by request of the person being treated. In such situations, it may be important and prudent for the therapist to seek out other people who may be more aware of the various issues involved. [...] [I]f therapists are to gain confidence in the ethics of their treatment, they should guard against treatment that unsophisticatedly threatens diversity in society.

{"date": "Monday, October 13, 2008", "body": "\nCanadians are voting in a general election tomorrow. All major national political parties in Canada (Conservatives, Liberals, New Democratic Party, Green Party) are autism advocacy parties. That is, they are part of the widespread effort  to make the world as free of autism--of autistic people--as possible .  Three of these parties have agreed that autistics contribute  nothing to society as autistics, and that ideally our existence should be prevented .  The fourth party, the Green Party, has welcomed and adopted the views of their star candidate, the ex-Liberal MP Blair Wilson. Mr Wilson's public position is that the existence of autistics is a  \"blight on society,\" a blight against which Canada must take action . And Mr Wilson's view is that only autistics who undergo ABA-based interventions starting early in life  have humanity. The rest of us--most autistics in Canada--don't . We have no humanity and aren't at all human.  Without exception, the positions of Canada's major national political parties entail writing off most autistics in Canada--those of us who haven't received unlimited ABA-based interventions starting early in life. The parties differ merely as to who exactly should pay for which aspects of the fight to achieve their collective ideal: a Canada free of autistic traits and abilities, and which has no autistic people at all.  In my search for someone I could vote for, I was given a closer look at one party's position. I was generously sent an internal Liberal policy document about autism.  This document includes information about the CIHR, about collaboration with autistic-free organizations whose goal is to prevent autism. But the Liberal's autism policy document is dominated by uncritical promotion of the premise that ABA-based interventions are the only effective  \"medically necessary\" autism treatment , without which all autistics are expensive write-offs.  The sum total of the evidence provided by the Liberals to support this premise is Lovaas (1987). In this study, autistic preschool children in the experimental group were systematically hit--and hit \"hard\" according to two behaviour analysts involved in this study (Leaf & McEachin, 2008). This systematic hitting of very young children was, according to the design of Lovaas (1987) and its author, a crucial aspect of the experimental group treatment. A small-N study with major problems in  reporting  and methodology, Lovaas (1987) is not a true experimental design, and represents the standards of behaviour analysis circa 38 years ago.  It also apparently represents the standards of science and ethics that Liberals in Canada believe autistics deserve.  The Liberals go on to make this claim: \"Currently, statistics show that 90% of afflicted individuals are placed in institutions and residential facilities, placing increasing pressure on Canada\u2019s education and social service programs.\" This isn't the first time  Liberals have denigrated developmentally disabled people by using what the Canadian Down Syndrome Society calls \"inappropriate\" and \"offensive\" language . To the Liberals, autistics are \"afflicted individuals\" and our proper place is in institutions. The 90% figure,  an autism advocacy staple, exists nowhere in the history of autism research  (for a review, see Howlin, 2005), much less in the present. Instead, this fictional figure reflects the extreme autism advocacy prejudice that autistics do not belong in society-- surely, at least in part because we are presumed to be a threat to others --and instead must be locked away in institutions.  The Liberal Party, like the NDP and the Greens, have fully supported the autism advocacy organization FEAT (also known as \"Medicare for Autism Now!\"), which promotes the view that not only must most autistics in Canada be  institutionalized, we must be kept in restraints and have our teeth pulled .  The Liberals elaborate the extent of the services required by all untreated autistics: \"With treatment, it is argued that the rate of institutionalization will be greatly diminished, and the current costs of over $300,000 per untreated autistic individual per year will be dramatically reduced.\" The only approach to autism promoted in this document is Lovaas-type ABA as medical treatment, which must start early in life. This leaves the majority of autistics in Canada as \"untreated\" more-than-$300,000-per-year drains on society.  From recently reported figures , in Ontario, it costs between $20,000 and $78,000 per year (average is $49,000) for a developmentally disabled person to stay in a group home, and ~$100,000 per year to keep a developmentally disabled person institutionalized. Even a private sector institution, the Judge Rotenberg Center in the US, with its high level of restrictive supervision and its notoriously intrusive intervention program (including the use of strong aversives),  is reported to charge ~$220,000 per year per inmate , many of whom are adults, many of whom are autistics.  So according to the Liberal Party of Canada, most autistics in Canada contribute nothing at all to society, in our entire lives. But beyond this, we just naturally have to be very expensively locked away into very secure--given the enormous cost-- institutions (of any size)  where we are constantly supervised and kept under control, apparently--given the enormous cost--by numerous round-the-clock staff. For our whole lives.  Using the currently-popularized autism prevalence figure of 1 in 150, there are ~150,000 autistic adults in Canada, and ~50,000 autistic children. Virtually all autistic adults in Canada are \"untreated\" (we did not receive Lovaas-type ABA starting early in life) and therefore we must, according to the Liberals, each be costing society at least $300,000 per year. That adds up to ~$45 billion per year. This is about the total amount the  federal government transfered to the provinces in the 2008 federal budget . And that's just to pay for us untreated autistic adults. This doesn't include the costs of younger autistics who might also for various reasons be untreated by Lovaas-type ABA.  These extraordinary costs would be paid by the provinces. In Ontario, there are ~60,000 autistic adults. According to the Liberals, the Ontario government would be paying more than $18 billion per year, just for the costs of autistic adults. This would be about one-fifth of Ontario's total program spending.  The Liberals, however, rush in with their solution to the terrifying and appalling situation they have invented: \"It is important to note that on the flip-side, the cost of a science-based program for every child diagnosed at the age of 2 years is typically $60,000 per year, for the first three years. Some children no longer require treatment after this treatment period; some of the children may require treatment for a few more years, and then there is a minority of children who may need some level of treatment for their entire childhood, not unlike a child who may need long-term chemotherapy. However, these treatment costs typically decrease over time for the vast majority of children.\"  Again, by \"science-based program,\" the Liberals are referring to Lovaas-type ABA as medical treatment. They contend that all autistic children do well in this treatment, and provided it continues if necessary until the end of childhood (where it apparently stops), Lovaas-type ABA is always successful in producing an autism-free individual.  There are no credible (in the peer-reviewed literature) sources for what the Liberals claim. Indeed, Lovaas (2003) makes the data-free claim that autistics who do not achieve \"normal functioning\" in ABA programs by age 7 (and the majority of autistics don't) will remain totally dependent on ABA programs for the rest of their lives.  There is no peer-reviewed paper that reports data about the adult outcomes of a controlled trial of Lovaas-type ABA (or any kind of ABA). The only follow-up into school ages follows-up the aversive-based treatment in Lovaas (1987; McEachin et al., 1993), and does not report that all autistic children in the experimental group eventually became free of autism and therefore had good outcomes. The only true experimental design (where the intended comparison between randomized groups was actually carried out) in the 47-year history of ABA-based autism intervention research, reported largely poor results in a small-N study, particularly for children with the specific diagnosis of autism (Smith, Groen & Wynn, 2000, 2001; don't forget to read the authors' errata). A recent uncontrolled trial, often falsely touted as a \"replication\" of Lovaas (1987), showed that the majority of children not only did not display improvement in their scores on any of the chosen outcome measures, they had significant losses in several measures (language, adapative abilities) over 4 years of intensive ABA (Sallows & Graupner, 2005). A recent  community-based study  showed that while preschool autistic children had widely varying individual short-term outcomes, their outcomes did not differ according to whether they did or did not receive Lovaas-type ABA (Magiati et al., 2007; see also Eaves & Ho, 2004, for similar results in a Canadian study). And so on.  With similar disregard for science and ethics, the Liberals claim that ABA-based autism interventions are just like chemotherapy. This is in concert with their  false contention that ABA is a medical treatment, researched and provided by medical professionals according to medical standards . But this also demonstrates how the Liberal Party of Canada sees autism: as a cancer, that has to be gotten rid of, from individuals and society. In the Liberals' view, there is everything to be gained and nothing whatsoever to lose if public policy dictates that autism must be totally gotten rid of, just like cancer. The Liberals go on to confirm how much money would be saved if autistic children all undergo Lovaas-type ABA as a medical treatment:  \"By implementing ABA/IBI therapy into the category of insurable health services, provinces and territories will save approximately $240,000 per autistic individual per year, with a declining cost scale associated with successful treatment outcomes.\" This Liberal Party autism policy document is so distant from accuracy, from recognized standards of science and ethics, that it's difficult to respond to (where do you start?). And indeed, I've been informed by Liberals, numerous times, that any criticism of the views of autism they widely disseminate is outrageous and unwelcome--how dare I. This is another hallmark of autism advocacy: any scrutiny or criticism of claims made about how autistics should be regarded and treated--any hint of standards of science and ethics--is seen as reprehensible, and is responded to by personal attacks. Autism advocacy as public policy is above science and ethics, above scrutiny and criticism.  My purpose isn't to single out the Liberals. I'm using their document as just one example of what autism advocacy is and what autism advocacy does. I suggest that if the other major political parties in Canada have produced internal autism documents or backgrounders, these too would be filled with policies and positions based on similar extreme falsehoods and stereotypes. These too would display abysmal standards of science and ethics. All of Canada's major political parties are autism advocacy parties displaying and promoting popular autism advocacy standards, values, methods and goals.  If you're not an autism advocate, if you want a place in Canadian society for autistics, if you support full equality and participation and recognized standards for autistics, if you believe autistics deserve better--there's no one to vote for.

{"date": "Friday, October 03, 2008", "body": "\n \"... the Tribunal finds that the complaint filed by Ms. Dawson against Canada Post is substantiated and that the Respondent has contravened sections 7 and 14 of the Act.\"  That's from paragraph 248 of a decision just released by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, in the first ever autism-related case referred to this Tribunal for a hearing. You can find this decision  here  in html and  here  in pdf. In some ways it's a very strange decision, with a stupefying number of just huge factual errors in it. Due to my own incompetence in representing myself (and in just generally functioning throughout the extensive hearings) and for other reasons, including the enormous factual errors made by the Tribunal, I lost some aspects of this case. But  to my own astonishment , I won other aspects. Indeed the aspects I won are those most important to me, and also those which I was firmly discouraged from pursuing by the Canadian Human Rights Commission ( which was a party to this case, representing the public interest ). Setting aside the astounding factual errors about the specifics of the case, as I believe they should be set aside, and setting aside my own personal situation, as I believe should also be set aside, this decision is entirely good for autistics in Canada. It is unprecedented in establishing under a human rights law in Canada that autistics--as autistic people, and regardless of what kinds of interventions we may or may not have received--are human beings with human rights. Here is an excerpt: [242] Be this as it may, the Tribunal finds it disturbing for the future of autistic people that they be seen because of their condition to pose a threat to the safety of others and some form of nuisance in the workplace. An employer has a duty to ensure not only that all employees work in a safe environment but also that ill perceptions about an employee's condition due to poor or inadequate information about his disability lead other employees to have negative and ill-founded perceptions about him. [243] An autistic person should expect that his workplace be free of any misperception or misconception about his condition. It goes to the right of autistic individuals to be treated equally, with dignity and respect, free of any discrimination or harassment related to their condition. In this respect, in a society where human rights are paramount, an employer has the duty to dispel such misconception or misperception about such individuals. [244] This duty stems from the  Canadian Human Rights Act  and the need to get rid of any discriminatory behavior in the workplace as well as in society in general. It is worth reminding employers as well as society as a whole that the purpose of the  Canadian Human Rights Act , as stated in section 2 of the  Act ,  is to give effect to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status,  disability  or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted. [245] Autistic people, if they want to be able to accomplish themselves in a workplace or in society, need to be reassured that everything possible short of undue hardship will be done in order to ensure that misperceptions and misconceptions about their condition are properly handled by their employer, so that co-workers have a proper understanding of their condition and are not inclined to discriminate against them or harass them. [246] To discriminate on the basis of somebody's physical appearance or social behavior might be one of the cruelest forms of discrimination. Here, Ms. Dawson was seen or perceived, at one point in her career at Canada Post, to be a threat to her co-workers because she had self-injured in the past, not because she had assaulted colleagues. She was later on perceived as a form of nuisance because she insisted on obtaining rational responses to her queries and never backed down. The fact of the matter is that Ms. Dawson was, until her diagnosis became officially known to Canada Post in 1999, seen as an excellent employee. [247] The Tribunal is of the opinion, in view of the evidence, that the Respondent needs to review its policies in relation to discrimination and harassment and put in place educational programs that will sensitize its employees as well as management to the needs of disabled individuals in the workplace, notably autistic individuals, so that individuals such as Ms. Dawson will not have to suffer from a lack of knowledge and understanding of their condition. In this respect, given the Canadian Human Rights Commission's expertise in these matters, the latter can surely provide assistance, which should be welcomed, to the Respondent. What I was dreading most was the  same thing I had dreaded in Auton at the Supreme Court of Canada : a decision that would harm autistics, would make our lives even more difficult, would further limit our possibilities, would make it less likely that we would ever be given the opportunity to demonstrate our ability to contribute to society as autistic people. But this Tribunal decision, for all its faults with respect to the facts of the specific case, is instead a step in the right direction. It's a step towards human rights for autistics in Canada, and towards all the possibilities human beings have, when we are regarded and treated as equals, and can proceed in society as fully human beings with human rights and dignity. As one autistic person, I did the best I could (with many thanks to those who helped along the way). And I didn't win every aspect of this specific--and very difficult and exhausting--case. But for all autistic people, this Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision is a one hundred percent victory.

{"date": "Sunday, July 13, 2008", "body": "\nJonathan Mitchell has posted that Marla Comm has died. He was informed of this by Susan Moreno of MAAP.  According to Mr Mitchell, Marla died of breast cancer. She was not much older than me.  Cancer is a truly horrible disease.  I can't remember which years it was that Marla would often phone me. This happened after Peter Zwack (who also died far too young of cancer) asked me if he could give my phone number to an autistic called Marla so she could phone me. I said sure. Eventually, Marla started phoning me.  The first thing about Marla is that she was brilliant. She had a math degree, from McGill I think. She knew all kinds of stuff (she once started talking about the keys in which klezmer music is played, e.g.). She shared my interest in the weather. She knew a lot about computers, but I couldn't speak with her about this due to my own total ignorance (I didn't have a computer at the time). I remember at some point, someone in her workplace gave her a computer.  Marla's determination was fantastic. She had been very determined in unearthing the records of her own past. She was very determined to have her story told in a book, and succeeded more than once.  In a city that's notoriously dangerous for cyclists, Marla routinely rode her bike from the west end of Montreal all the way to the Olympic stadium way over in the east, and back--amazing. She also rollerbladed. I'm sure I saw her once (we never met--I don't think she wanted to meet me--but I did see a photo of her in a media story), whizzing by through an intersection, with great verve, poised and confident and--happy. She loved biking and rollerblading. Also, she liked walking up big hills--something we had in common.  She hated winter, disliked French, had a poor opinion of francophone Quebecois, and wanted maybe more than anything (at least, during the time she phoned me) to live in an English city where there is no winter. She hated Montreal. But she was an active citizen; she often told me that another of her letters to the editor had been published in the Montreal Gazette. She would sometimes tell me, when she phoned me, that she couldn\u2019t talk much because she had so much email, from friends and supporters, to read.  She didn't need too much in the way of services and assistance, but what she needed, she really needed. During the time she phoned me, she had not succeeded in getting the relatively minor services and assistance she needed and which would have made a major difference in her life. She had tried very hard, and had very bad experiences in trying.  The kind of help she needed, I couldn\u2019t have provided (even if she had asked me, which she didn\u2019t), and I had no more success than she did, in obtaining even minor assistance via autism societies, etc. I tried to share with her ways I dealt with my own limitations, but she was neither interested nor in the least impressed. After all, I was usually in more trouble than she was, throughout the time we spoke. I could hardly recommend anything, as she astutely noticed. One thing she told me was that she never laughed. She had no sense of humour at all. But once when she phoned me, she launched into an anecdote about her family. I pointed out that it was very funny, and she laughed, right out loud. She had a great laugh. Some other times when she talked, she got very close to laughing too. But she did outright laugh that one time--she saw the absurdity in the story she had done a superb job of telling me, and it made her laugh.  Once when she phoned me, I told her I thought she was totally cool. This was true: I often disagreed with things she said, but I thought she was totally cool. This seemed to bother her, and she never phoned me again. She had never indicated in all the time she phoned me, that she would be okay if I phoned her, much less that she wanted me to phone her. So I did not try to phone her, and that was the last we spoke, many years ago.  Now and then I would hear news about her, and when I got online found her here and there as well, always wanting to get away from Montreal, the city she hated.  It's terrible that she died of cancer at such a young age. I hope she managed to rollerblade as long as she could. That's how I'll remember her, flying by on the street, free and happy in the summer.

{"date": "Thursday, June 19, 2008", "body": "\nI wrote about the life and death of Tiffany Pinckney  here . She was a young autistic woman who was neglected for years extending back into her childhood, by her sister and legal guardian Allison Cox. In the spring of 2005, Tiffany died of starvation in the place where she lived, deliberately locked into a filthy, windowless basement, with no access to a toilet, food or water. She was skin-and-bones when she died, a skeleton, and caked with dirt and feces, just like the room she was locked into. She suffered beyond what can be described in words, in the middle of a wealthy Mississauga neighbourhood, hidden underneath a fancy four-bedroom home.  She may have been dead in her basement prison for more than two days before her death was reported via a 9-11 call.  Today Allison Cox was sentenced to nine years in prison for deliberately neglecting and starving her sister Tiffany to death.  You can find information about Ms Cox's sentencing in today's  Toronto Star . Here is an excerpt: Justice Joseph Fragomeni described the circumstances of the case as among the worst he's ever experienced as a trial judge.  He said Pinckney endured a \"slow, painful and lonely descent into death,\" and that the \"graphic and disturbing photos\" presented during the trial \"spoke volumes\" about the last days of her life.  He told Cox that society demanded that she serve a lengthy period of incarceration in a federal penitentiary for what he described as a \"tragic, horrific and senseless\" death of a \"vulnerable\" young person.  He said Pinckney was denied the \"most basic\" of human necessities. \"She was denied food, water and medical attention,\" he said.  \"How is it possible in a country of such wealth and abundance that a person could die from a lack of food and water?\" Justice Fragomeni asked. \"Tiffany didn't see a doctor for five years ... (Cox\u2019s) breach of trust was egregious.\"  The question remains why Ms Cox was not charged with a more serious crime. In a November 1, 2007 story, the  Toronto Star  quoted John Raftery, the prosecutor, as arguing in court that: \"Not only is there enough evidence to convict her (Cox) of manslaughter but there is sufficient evidence for first-degree murder.\"   In 2002, a young boy called Jeffrey Baldwin  died in Toronto of extreme neglect at the hands of his legal guardians.  He was locked in a room, starved,  \"forced to sleep in his own excrement\" , and grossly mistreated, though unlike Tiffany, he had a toilet to drink from. Jeffrey was not autistic. His horrific death (his body was  \"covered with sores and abrasions\" and at nearly age six weighed less than what a one year old should weigh ) attracted sustained attention from the major media. No one attempted to blame his death on his own characteristics, his own needs or abilities, his own presumed level of functioning, his own behaviour, etc.  Jeffrey's guardians were originally charged with first degree murder, were convicted of second degree murder, and were required to serve 20 to 22 years in prison (close to the maximum for first degree murder) before being eligible for parole. Nine years in prison (and two years of house arrest for Ms Cox's husband, Orlando Klass) does not seem much, against  the life and death of Tiffany Pinckney , and how much she suffered for so long.  Before being deliberately neglected and starved took all her possibilities away, and when she was away from the horror of her home, Tiffany   \"loved music.\" She was \"lots of fun\" and \"excited and happy.\" She was \"great.\"  I will always remember her, every day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/446217", "http://www.thestar.com/News/article/272555", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Baldwin", "http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/04/07/childmurder-060407.html", "http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/04/07/childmurder-060407.html"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2008/06/nine-years.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 04, 2008", "body": "\nSince  last I wrote about Autism Speaks' epidemiology , two changes have been made on Autism Speaks' website. See  here  and  here , compare to original versions  here . No other changes were made, and Autism Speaks has recently elaborated on their epidemiology in press releases and the media. So it's possible to sum up Autism Speaks' epidemiology: 1. current prevalence of autism in the US is  1 in 150 ; 2. 10 years ago, prevalence was 1 in 1500 (as stated  on all of Autism Speaks' press releases ); 3. the \" rate of autism is rising 10-17 percent annually. Unfortunately, the numbers appear to be continuing their upward climb \"; 4.  there is an \"epidemic\" of autism , and this is a \" recent epidemic \"; 5. because the autism epidemic is recent,  older autistics do not exist ; and 6. there are  1.5 million autistic people , total, in the US. Given this array of information,  the question remains  as to how Autism Speaks calculated their 1.5 million figure. This figure  is inconsistent with existing data . Autism Speaks' Chief Science Officer,  Geraldine Dawson , was kind enough to provide more information: 1. Autism Speaks is using the 2000 census figure of ~280 million for current total US population;  2. Autism Speaks is using not the 1 in 150 prevalence figure Autism Speaks widely promotes, but a prevalence of 1 in 166;  3. the source for the 1 in 166 figure is Bertrand et al. (2001); 4. applying a prevalence of 1 in 166 across the total US population of 280 million yields 1.68 million autistics (it is actually 1.69 million);  5. this figure is rounded down to the nearest half million, to the Autism Speaks 1.5 million.  I can spot some problems. Autism Speaks states that the prevalence reported in Bertrand et al. (2001) is 1 in 166. But even a cursory reading of  this paper's abstract  shows that this is false. Here's a quote: \"The prevalence of all autism spectrum disorders combined was 6.7 cases per 1000 children.\" Prevalence of 6.7 per 1000 comes out to 1 in 149--or about 1 in 150, the prevalence figure Autism Speaks widely promotes. Applying a prevalence of 1 in 150 across the 2000 US census figure of 280 million equals 1.87 million autistics. Following Autism Speaks' apparent policy of rounding to the nearest half million, that would be 2 million autistics in the US. Then where does the 1 in 166 prevalence figure came from? The source Autism Speaks provided, Bertrand et al. (2001), does not report this figure. Autism Speaks' epidemiological expert, Michael Rosanoff, helpfully informed me that Autism Speaks was using figures from the US only, in calculating the Autism Speaks 1.5 million.  In fact the 1 in 166 figure first appeared in the literature in Chakrabarti and Fombonne (2001), as an estimate based on the results of three epidemiological studies. Two are UK studies (Baird et al., 2000; Chakrabarti & Fombonne, 2001); the other is the US study, Bertrand et al. (2001) which reported a prevalence of ~1 in 150. No published US epidemiological study reports a prevalence of 1 in 166.  Another problem is that Autism Speaks' Chief Science Officer is stating that there is a high, stable rate of autism. This is a scientifically sound position but, as  enumerated above, one thoroughly rejected by Autism Speaks. Instead, Autism Speaks   widely disseminates the information  that the prevalence of autism \" has increased tenfold in the last decade .\" That is, 10 years ago, the prevalence of autism was 1 in 1500. If this is accurate, then the total number of autistics in the US would be less than 500,000. How much less would depend on what happened prior to 10 years ago, and how suddenly the leap from 1 in 1500 to 1 in 150 occurred.  At the same time, Autism Speaks is basing its epidemiology on three US studies. In Bertrand et al. (2001), the children were born between 1988 and 1995. Virtually all would be diagnosable as autistic by ten years ago, and the prevalence in this population was found to be ~1 in 150.  The more recently published CDC studies (ADDMN, 2007a, b)  highlighted by Autism Speaks  feature children born in 1992 and 1994. Again, virtually all would have been diagnosable as autistic by 10 years ago, and prevalence in this population was reported as ~1 in 150.  So Autism Speaks' array of information about autism prevalence is distant from what is reported in the scientific literature. Overall, Autism Speaks is claiming there are fewer autistics in the US than there actually are. How many fewer varies enormously, depending on which of Autism Speaks' contradictory figures is chosen. And the upshot is primarily  the denial of the lives   and existence of older autistics . In an  international   \" They Don't Exist \" campaign , Autism Speaks is denying older autistics--around the world--recognition, rights, a voice, the kind of basic services nonautistics can take for granted, etc.  This anti-scientific and unethical practice is  a hallmark of autism advocacy . Autism Speaks is denying the existence of most autistic adults and of large numbers of autistic children.  In order to accomplish this amazing feat, this disappearing of autistics in the US and around the world, Autism Speaks is widely disseminating false, anti-scientific information about autistic people. This false information is deployed to raise money and to alter public policy according to Autism Speaks' goals. There is no thought as to the consequences for autistics. Autism Speaks is sending a powerful message that scientific findings--which Autism Speaks raises money to fund--should be dishonestly misrepresented and discarded, when these findings inconveniently get in the way of autism advocacy leaders such as themselves. And according to Autism Speaks, so should autistic lives be discarded, if they are in the way.

{"date": "Friday, June 13, 2008", "body": "\nAutism Speaks promotes 1.5 million as the number of autistics in the US, a figure Autism Speaks associates with a 1 in 150 prevalence of autism. For example,  Autism Speaks' FAQ states that : \"As many as 1 in 150 children are autistic, according to the Centers for Disease Control. That adds up to almost 1.5 million people in the United States.\" You can also find Autism Speaks informing the public that all those 1.5 million autistics are children. Here's a quote  from a recent Autism Speaks press release, where Mark Roithmayr, Autism Speaks' President, is quoted as saying : \"Toys\u201cR\u201dUs has been a tremendous partner in helping us shine a national spotlight on this disorder, which affects 1.5 million children in the United States.\" My question is, where does the Autism Speaks 1.5 million come from? Other autism advocacy organizations use this figure, but Autism Speaks is the current authority, the major private autism research funding body, a major influence on public spending, the biggest, most powerful autism advocacy organization of them all, representing and deciding the ( ideally, according to Autism Speaks, very short ) future of all autistic people.  If there are 1.5 million autistic children in the US, as Autism Speaks claims, and if the prevalence of autism is 1 in 150, as Autism Speaks also claims, then the total number of children in the US would have to be 225 million.  According to the US Census Bureau, the total US population is currently  just above 300 million . According to the same source, the total number of children (age 0-19) in the US  would be about 80 million . If Autism Speaks is still insisting, as it did in a May 2008 press release, that there are 1.5 million autistic children in the US, then Autism Speaks has discarded the 1 in 150 prevalence figure in favour of 1 in 53 ( even higher than the UK Observer could manage  in its big, bogus, retracted autism scare story). On the other hand, if Autism Speaks is claiming that there are 1.5 million autistics in total in the US, including autistic adults, this produces an overall prevalance of about 1 in 200, dramatically lower than Autism Speaks' widely advertised 1 in 150.  Or Autism Speaks might be claiming that the prevalence of autism is 1 in 150 in children, and lower in adults. In order for the 1.5 million figure to work this way, the prevalence of autism in adults would have to be about 1 in 220. This is not a figure that I can find anywhere on the Autism Speaks website, never mind its rationale.  On the other hand, if Autism Speaks applies their advertised 1 in 150 prevalence figure to the entire US population ( which cracked 300 million in 2006 ), then the result is a total of 2 million autistics in the US, of whom about 500,000 are children and 1.5 million are adults. But this would mean that there has been a high stable rate of autism. This is a scientifically sound position, but one that Autism Speaks and autism advocacy in general has rejected.  All of the figures above are easy enough to find and calculate--well within Autism Speaks' abilities. After all, Autism Speaks has numerous scientific advisors as well as a chief scientific officer. And a difference of 500,000 between the figure promoted by Autism Speaks and the figure consistent with the existing scientific literature is hardly trivial. What major, high-profile disability organization would so persistently deny the existence of hundreds of thousands of the disabled people it claims to represent? This can only result in disabled people being unable to obtain services, unable to be recognized for their contributions, unable to have a voice in their own future, etc.   But this is what autism advocates do. One of the near universals of autism advocacy is the promotion of the autism \"epidemic,\" and the rejection of the scientific position that there's been a high stable rate of autism. The main effect of this has been the denial of the existence of older autistics. In Canada,  this denial of autistic lives by autism advocates has been extreme . Another universal of autism advocacy is a gross disregard for accuracy and ethics in reporting what is known about autism. Autism Speaks is telling the world--including governments--that when it comes to autism, you don't need to bother with the facts. You don't need to check your basic arithmetic, much less take the trouble to look up primary sources. Autism Speaks' widely disseminated 1.5 million figure, and its casual denial of half a million autistic lives, is just one example of the standards of science and ethics that leading autism advocates apply to autistics.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/whatisit/faq.php", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/press/toys_r_us_2008_results.php", "http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2008/edition_01-27-2008/Autism_Changes_Everything", "http://www.census.gov/population/www/popclockus.html", "http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/usinterimproj/natprojtab02a.pdf", "http://www.badscience.net/2007/07/the-mmr-story-that-wasnt/", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6057004.stm"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2008/06/epidemiology-of-autism-speaks.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, February 10, 2008", "body": "\nTiffany Pinckney died on April 2, 2005, in a filthy windowless basement under a fancy four-bedroom home in a well-off neighbourhood in Mississauga, Ontario. She was autistic. She died of starvation at the age of 23, having been neglected to death. She was skin and bones, when she died. She was found to have brain damage (Central Pontine Myelinolysis) consistent with malnutrition and deprivation of or inadequate provision of water.  I didn't hear about her until she had been dead for several months. At the end of July, 2005, after an extensive investigation, police laid charges against Tiffany's older sister Allison Cox and her husband Orlando Klass. Reports of these charges (failure to provide the necessities of life; criminal negligence causing death) were the first mentions of the death of Tiffany Pinckney in the media.  It was in Ms Cox and Mr Klass' basement that Tiffany died. It's possible that she died while Ms Cox, who had been Tiffany's legal guardian for seven years, attended a birthday party with her children.  In June, 2007, Mr Klass pleaded guilty to the charge of criminal negligence causing death. He did not go to jail. He was sentenced to two years of house arrest. Meanwhile, Ms Cox was additionally charged with manslaughter in Tiffany's death.  Here is a bit about the life and death of Tiffany Pinckney. The information comes from media reports about her death in 2005 (from the  National Post  and the  Toronto Star , among others), and media reports in October and November, 2007, about the trial of Allison Cox (from the  Toronto Star  and the  Missisauga News ). Tiffany Pinckney was born in the U.S. and lived there with her mother until the early 1990s, when they moved to Canada.  Tiffany was born with a heart defect, and was diagnosed as \"mentally challenged\" when she was four. She was diagnosed autistic when she was 10 (which would be circa 1992).  When Tiffany was 16, in 1998, her mother died of cancer. Ms Cox became Tiffany's legal guardian and principal caregiver.  The first reports I read about Tiffany's death (e.g., in the Toronto Star, July 27, 2005) suggested that she had been neglected for a long time--possibly more than seven years. This would be the entire time she was under the care of Ms Cox. Some of the reported testimony at Ms Cox's trial was consistent with this. For example, a teacher at the school Tiffany attended until 2003 (when she would have been 21) testified about Tiffany's poor condition (weight loss, obvious lack of care, \"she did not look well\") going back to her teens. The same testimony suggested that at this school, Tiffany was loved. She \"loved music.\" She was considered \"lots of fun\" and \"great.\" She was \"excited and happy\" taking the bus to school but \"upset\" returning home to the care of Ms Cox (all from the Toronto Star, October 12, 2007). There was also testimony from various sources that Ms Cox persistently refused offers of assistance and services in caring for Tiffany. Also, Tiffany was not taken to see a doctor in the last five years of her life. But neither those who witnessed Tiffany's deterioration at school, nor those whose services were refused, did anything to ensure that Tiffany was getting at least the minimum of necessary care. One of Tiffany's teachers testified that if Tiffany had been 3 years old, she \"would have called the Children's Aid Society\" (also from the Toronto Star, October 12, 2007). But this teacher did not do anything and nor did anyone else.  In August of 2004, Tiffany was moved by Ms Cox to a four bedroom home, described in the  National Post  as being on a street \"lined with two-storey homes and well-kept lawns.\"  Here, Tiffany was kept in an unfinished windowless basement room with bare walls. She slept on a deflated air mattress on plywood or pressboard. There was no toilet in the basement. There was no running water. No source of food. Neighbours reported being totally unware that Tiffany existed.  There was a lock, on the door down to the basement. And this door had been reinforced by the addition of weather stripping. So Tiffany was both locked and sealed into the basement.  Upstairs, there was a lock on the refrigerator.  She died of starvation over a long period of time, losing more than 100 pounds. When she died, she weighed 84 pounds and was described as \"skeletal.\" There was expert testimony that adequate provision of food and water could have saved her life.  At her death, she was caked in dirt, urine and feces, as was the room she lived in, where the stench was reported as being appalling. She looked exactly how any person locked and sealed into a basement for many months and denied access to food, water, a toilet, the light of day, etc., might be expected to look.  It is hard to imagine how much Tiffany must have suffered.  On February 2, 2008, Ms Cox was convicted of manslaughter by Judge Joseph Fragomeni. She has been free on bail since her original arrest, and will remain free until she is sentenced in May, 2008.  While I have been writing about Tiffany Pinckney sporadically since 2005, it has taken me a long time to write this short and totally inadequate post about her life and death.  In trying to write this, I've often stopped and wondered if Tiffany had ever, in the months she was dying, sealed and locked in the basement, tried to escape. Maybe she had been neglected for too long, was too sick and weak. Maybe she had been, as many autistics are, successfully discouraged from any behaviours involved in escaping. Also I am thinking of her when she was younger and not yet dying, getting \"upset\" on the bus going home, after enjoying her day at school. It seems to me that she was communicating  something important . Possibly, she communicated this important thing many, many times and when this made no difference (perhaps she was considered to be misbehaving) she stopped. I've often stopped and wondered whether she would be alive if someone, anyone, had listened.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.geocities.com/naboy.geo/Federalpublicservice/klaorl_nationalpost_270705.pdf", "http://www.thestar.com/", "http://www.thestar.com/", "http://www.mississauganews.com/", "http://www.geocities.com/naboy.geo/Federalpublicservice/klaorl_nationalpost_270705.pdf", "http://www.uoguelph.ca/oaar/frazee-dec02.html"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2008/02/life-and-death-of-tiffany-pinckney.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, November 03, 2007", "body": "\nThe following is what I will probably send to Globe and Mail reporter Erin Anderssen, if I can get my email to work (yes, you can blame my computer for my long lapse in blogging)--about  this Globe and Mail article .  Ms Anderssen, With respect to \"Autistics: We don't want a cure\" from the Globe and Mail (November 3, 2007): When I spoke with you, I stated directly that I should not be falsely described as an \"activist.\" Once I understood what the word \"activist\" meant (this did take a while, which is typical for me), I knew I wasn't an activist--something I've known for some years now. Some people have called me an activist, but some people have also called me a fraud, and neither is accurate. At the time, you agreed that you would describe me only as a researcher. Yet in your article, you dishonestly chose to falsely describe me as an activist.  My correspondence with you also shows that I had not understood what kind of article you were planning to write. But once I realized you were writing an article about a cultural phenomenon (this was not what I had understood about your article; you had been referred to me by a scientist), I stated, in writing, that I should not be in this kind of article--which tends to add more irrationality to the already irrational public discourse about autism. But you put me in your cultural phenomenon article anyway.  And while I am in your article, the factual and verifiable information I gave you, which is typical of the information many autistics publicly provide, was overwhelmingly ignored. Instead, your article depends on caricatured and harmful stereotypes of autism and autistic people. All my statements to you about neurodiversity (a subject far beyond the scope of autism, and about which I've written virtually nothing) included the information that neurodiversity is part of the general idea that disabled people should have human rights. I gave numerous examples from other disability areas, including blindness, Down syndrome and the general area of developmental disability.  I provided you with examples of legal cases where the demands of some parents of disabled children and the interests of disabled people were incompatible. Developmentally disabled people--who would be written off as \"low-functioning\" by autism advocates like Harold Doherty--have  used the courts to oppose those trying to deny their human and legal rights . As I wrote to you, the work of groups like  People First , which I admire enormously, exemplifies what neurodiversity means: that disabled people are fully human and should have human rights, regardless of how hard some groups and individuals work to write us off. Instead of acknowledging this view, which is commonplace among autistics, you report  only  the false distinction, that autism is a difference but not a disability, as if disability is necessarily something wrong and inferior. This is the opposite of what I communicated to you, and the opposite of what neurodiversity represents. But you were only getting started: then you go to town presenting extreme and offensive views--including that autistics are superior beings with \"superpowers\"-- held by some autistics. These unfounded and offensive views are, as much as possible, publicly criticized and opposed by many other autistics whenever they are expressed--an essential bit of balance that you totally failed to report.  You also failed to report what  should  be considered extreme views on the part of autism advocates, but which are in fact mainstream views supported by major autism organizations and political parties. For example, I provided you with FEAT's statement--in the Globe and Mail--that autistics who have not received unlimited ABA-based interventions starting early in life--that is, most autistics in Canada--must be  institutionalized, abused (kept in restraints), and mutilated (our teeth pulled) . FEAT is Canada's most powerful and influential autism advocacy group. Their extreme public statements have not resulted in any opposition or criticism from autism advocates, and have indeed been greeted with their applause. And FEAT has full support from two of Canada's major national political parties: the Liberals and NDP, whose only objection has been to any suggestion that FEAT's positions are extreme.  I also provided you with my one-sentence position: that autistics are fully human and should have human rights; and that autistics deserve the recognized standards of science and ethics that automatically protect and benefit nonautistics--such as yourself--and without which you could not proceed safely in society, much less have a good outcome.  This is the position that Mr Doherty so vehemently opposes.  I communicated to you the important question of why autism advocates--powerful and influential leaders like FEAT and Mr Doherty--have been unwilling or unable to make their demands for services-- whatever those services may be --accurately (including with respect to the existing science), ethically, and respectfully.  I communicated to you the problem of autism advocacy leaders like FEAT and Mr Doherty writing off autistic people, denying autistics basic human rights, denying autistics recognized standards of science and ethics, and successfully demanding that  laws that protect themselves should not protect us . The actions of Mr Doherty and others similar, as I wrote to you, make daily life difficult and dangerous for many autistic people--just as the denial of basic rights and standards, and of the protection of the law, would make daily life difficult and dangerous for anyone. Then Mr Doherty  et al.  point at our difficult and poor outcomes, declare us a crisis and drain on society, and demand that autistics be eradicated.  As I wrote in response to Mr Doherty's comments on my blog about  self-injury and institutionalization , he would be the first to write me off if he saw me in difficulty. He would be the first to use me as an example of why autism is a horrific disease that must be eradicated.  Indeed, as I explained to you, I have experienced being written off via the values Mr Doherty and other powerful autism advocates embody--and impose on all autistics. No doubt I'll be written off this way again. I'm well placed to understand why autistics often suffer and have poor outcomes--and will continue to so long as Mr Doherty and others similar persist in dehumanizing us, in spreading false, anti-scientific information about us, in spreading the word that we're dangerous and violent and/or frauds and criminals, in denying us rights, standards, and the protection of the law--and in writing us off. I provided a short summary of my views about neurodiversity when I first spoke with you. I don't know much about neurodiversity, but it's easy when there's organizations like the Canadian Down Syndrome Society, which disseminates information like this: \"Down syndrome is not a disease, disorder, defect or medical condition. It is inappropriate and offensive to refer to people with Down syndrome as \"afflicted with\" or \"suffering from\" it. Down syndrome itself does not require either treatment or prevention.\" I also told you that in a major advertising campaign (including a large ad in the Globe and Mail), the CDSS expressed their ideal that in the future, intolerance will be cured, not DS. I could have added that the CDSS utterly fails to silence or deny the worth of people with DS based on what kind of DS they have or what their apparent abilities are. I did tell you directly that only autism advocates would leap to the irrational presumption that the CDSS is really saying that DS people (unlike all other human beings) do not need assistance or services, and that DS people (unlike all other human beings) never suffer at all and never face any challenges or difficulties.  But large portions of your article are founded on this kind of irrational presumption, which would be instantly spotted as both absurd and dangerous in any other disability area.  I have no idea where this bit of your article  \"They say autism should be seen as part of the \u201cneurodiversity\u201d needed to evolve smarter human beings and this one \"In blog discussions, autistics sometimes even speak of themselves as a \u201csuperior species\u201d  and many others similar (\"superpowers,\" etc.) came from, as they (and many positions attributed to \"autistics\" in your article) were not sourced. But as I noted above, a lot of autistics, myself included, consider that statements like these--and many of the views ascribed to autistics in your article--range from unfounded to ludicrous, extreme, offensive, dangerous--and/or pathetic. Etc. Many of us have publicly written a lot in criticism of and opposition to these views. Yes, you are free to choose to report claims of unfounded, offensive, etc., views held by some autistic people--from whatever sources you wish. But reporting these views as though they were representative of \"neurodiversity\" or of autistics is dishonest and unethical. It is in the same neighbourhood as taking  David Ahanakew's  (or  James Watson's ) extreme and offensive statements, and reporting them, without naming their source, as being representative of the views of aboriginal people (or white people). And then seriously reporting the views of non-aboriginals (or non-whites) about these extreme and offensive positions held by aboriginal people (or white people).  The Globe and Mail should print a correction, clarification and apology. First, a correction--of the false information in your article that I'm an activist, which you dishonestly reported. Second, a clarification--to make it clear that many of the views you have ascribed to \"autistics\" or associated with \"neurodiversity\" are regarded by many autistics, myself included, as ranging from unfounded to offensive and dangerous, contrary to the strong and misleading impression given throughout much of your article. Third, an apology--for the problems caused by the false information printed in your article, as well as for recklessly and knowingly (you did not lack accurate, verfiable information) promoting harmful stereotypes of autistic people as a group. I realize this request is ridiculous. It belongs in an as-yet non-existent world, where autism and autistics are taken seriously. As I've written before, autism advocates  trivialize autism  and in so doing, harm autistic people. Autism advocates, who claim to know what's best for all autistics,   do not take autism seriously  and, following their powerful and influential leadership, nor has the Globe and Mail.

{"date": "Wednesday, July 18, 2007", "body": "\nSo are autistics really going to take over the known world? We know there's been a staggering surge in irresponsible autism-related journalism. It's even hit the  BMJ . There's overwhelming evidence that 1 in 58 is not a genuine autism prevalence figure, but the product of shoddy and dishonest reporting (see Ben Goldacre  here , looks like he's going to be in the BMJ  on Friday , and the Times  here ). Nothing like irresponsible reporting to waste heaps of time and effort that could otherwise be spent in applying accurate information to help autistic people. But what about that surge in autism? Is there one? This is not a popular position in our era of autism advocacy--but when in doubt, consult with the peer-reviewed data. Here are 7 recently reported autism prevalence figures for children of various ages in the US and UK. All figures are for all autistic spectrum diagnoses combined. I've rounded them off to the nearest 5--autism prevalence figures don't come with pin-point precision. Here goes: 1 in 175 1 in 170 1 in 160 1 in 150 [1 in 150] [1 in 150] 1 in 85 1 in 58 Wow, that looks like a big autism surge, even without that last figure. And those low/no standards for autistics so successfully pushed by autism advocates would demand that the 1 in 58 be tacked on at the end (there it is, in red, from shame). Now it looks like autism is surging even more. I've also put two of the figures in square parentheses. That's because they're not quite like the other non-red figures. I'll get back to this. Maybe we should look at when these figures were published in peer-reviewed journals, just in case it's informative. 1 in 175 (2000)* 1 in 160 (2001)** 1 in 150 (2001) 1 in 170 (2005)** 1 in 85 (2006)* [1 in 150 (2007)]*** [1 in 150 (2007)]*** 1 in 58 (not published) That looks slightly less persuasive, but we could probably still argue that autism is surging, all the more so if we adopt autism advocacy standards for autistics and include the red-faced 1 in 58. Or we could subject these studies to a bit of scrutiny. With two (non-red) exceptions, these studies meet two criteria: (1) they used DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria for autism and the other autistic spectrum diagnoses; and (2) at least some of the counted children were directly assessed by the researchers using one or the other or both of the current standardized, quantified gold-standard autism diagnostic instruments.  The two exceptions are in square parentheses. They are US prevalence studies that don't meet my second criterion. They don't involve direct assessment of autistic children, instead relying on less reliable information from educational and/or medical records. But these two are very popular studies. I've included them (in parentheses) because their 1 in 150 has, since these studies were widely publicized early this year, often been reported as the prevalence of autism. I've also paired up most of the studies. The ones with one asterisk (*) belong with each other. This pair of studies was done in the exact same geographic area. The ones with two asterisks (**) also belong with each other, and also were done in the same geographic area. And the ones with three asterisks (***) belong with each other too, and have some overlap in geographic area. Regardless of geographic area, and keeping in mind the two criteria for studies I provided above, the pairs are paired in two different ways: studies using the same methodology with different birth year cohorts; and studies using different methodology with the same birth year cohort. If autism is indeed surging, studies using the same methodology with different birth year cohorts should show autism prevalence increasing over time. And studies of the same birth year cohort using the same diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV or ICD-10) should show the same autism prevalence. If not, then the extent to which differences in methodology contribute to reported differences in prevalence would have to be contemplated--and this might inconvenience the \"surging autism\" contingent. So if there really is an autism surge, we should find that the (*) pair represents two studies with the same methodology but different birth year cohorts, where the higher figure (1 in 85) is found in a later birth year cohort than the much lower figure (1 in 175). And we should find that the other two pairings, where the figures are the same (the *** pair, with 1 in 150) or nearly the same (the ** pair, with 1 in 160 and 1 in 170; this is not a significant difference), are studies of the same birth year cohorts done with whatever methodology, provided the same diagnostic criteria are used. Well, it doesn't quite work out that way. In fact, it's the opposite. That (*) pair represents the same birth year cohort, different methodology. And those other pairs (*** and **) represent different birth year cohorts, same methodology. That's keeping in mind that apart from the square parentheses (***) pair, and apart from the beet red 1 in 58, all the other studies meet both my own criteria--they use the same current diagnostic criteria, and they involve at least some direct assessment of children with one or the other or both of the current gold-standard diagnostic instruments. How about ordering all the studies according to the years in which the children being studied were actually born. If that autism surge is autism reality, then we should see that surge, uh, surging right along as birth year cohorts become more recent. It's about time I named the studies, and I've kept the asterisks, just in case anyone's keeping track. Here goes again: 1 in 150 (1988-1995; Bertrand et al., 2001) 1 in 175 (1990-1991; Baird et al., 2000)* 1 in 85 (1990-1991; Baird et al., 2006)* [1 in 150 (1992; ADDMN, 2007)]*** 1 in 160 (1992-1995; Chakrabarti & Fombonne, 2001)** [1 in 150 (1994; ADDMN, 2007]*** 1 in 58 (1993-1997; not published) 1 in 170 (1996-1998; Chakrabarti & Fombonne, 2005)** That didn't work out too well either. Now we don't have a surge at all, just a bunch of findings--spanning a decade of birth years--that are very close to each other, and (leaving out the crimson 1 in 58) one figure that looks like an outlier. But we can't attribute the 1 in 85 (it is actually 116.1/10,000) in Baird et al. (2006), a figure often rounded off to 1 in 100, to a surge in autism, because much lower prevalence figures have been found in several later birth year cohorts. Never mind that a much lower prevalence figure was found in  the same cohort  in Baird et al. (2000). Indeed, what the two Baird et al. studies demonstrate is the dramatic effect methodology can have on reported autism prevalence within the same cohort--even when the same diagnostic criteria are used, even when there is an overlap in the standardized diagnostic instruments used (both Baird studies used the ADI-R), and even when the studies are conducted by an overlapping group of researchers. The two studies differ primarily in that the later study also used the ADOS, two of the diagnosing clinicians changed, and the method of case finding was altered. That was enough to double the reported prevalence  within the same cohort . In contrast, the two Chakrabarti and Fombonne studies show that applying the same methodology to different birth year cohorts results in the same autism prevalence. No surge in sight. The two in-parentheses studies, which are the now-famous CDC prevalence studies, show the same thing but with weaker methodology over a shorter timespan. Autism advocates are free to seek that recent surge in autism--that catastrophic epidemic--in anecdotes, in education numbers or the CDDS, in sensationalist headlines and so on. This is all in keeping with the rotten standards of science and ethics they've imposed on autistics, and with their own steadfast resistance against verifiable information. But on the off-chance anyone's interested in the published, peer-reviewed data, I thought I'd go fetch some. If anyone finds any factual errors in the information I've presented, I'd greatly appreciate knowing. Accurate information is always good for autistics.

You can find the abstract of this in press paper  here   [edit: If you follow the link, you'll see that this paper has now been published]: Magiati, I., Charman, T., & Howlin, P. (in press). A two-year prospective follow-up study of community-based early intensive behavioural intervention and specialist nursery provision for children with autism spectrum disorders.  Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry.   As I wrote earlier , Dr Howlin's study is a prospective, community-based study comparing the outcomes of 28 autistic children receiving home-based intensive ABA-based interventions (the ABA group) with a control group of 16 autistic children receiving \"autism specific nursery provision\" (the nursery group). The interventions are described as being \"typical\" of ABA and nursery services available in the UK. The children were between 23 and 54 months and had a very wide range of IQs (16 to 138) at intake. They were followed up after ~26 months.  The ABA group received intensive 1:1 Lovaas-type ABA, with two children receiving additional Verbal Behaviour services. For 20 ABA group children, ABA services were provided by \"recognised ABA organisations in the UK, Norway or USA\", while the remaining 8 children had independent providers. The nursery group was distributed across 10 different schools. They received what would be called \"eclectic\" intervention, where the \"most common named practices\" included TEACCH, PECS (an ABA-based approach), Makaton, and SPELL (from a 2001 guide published by the UK National Autistic Society), as well as \"other developmental and behavioural teaching methods\".  And--as reported in the abstract--after a bit more than 2 years, there were no significant differences to report between the ABA and nursery groups in a multitude of outcome measures. On only one measure was a difference approaching significance found in favour of the ABA group (Vineland Daily Living Skills, where  p =.06). In contrast, there were major individual differences among the children in progress made, regardless of which group the children were in.  As happens in non-randomized controlled trials, the two groups were not matched on many variables at intake. The authors accounted for only one of these unmatched variables--a significant difference in mean intake IQ which favoured the ABA group (83 for the ABA group; 65 for the nursery group). Other significant differences at intake (e.g., Vineland socialization, Vineland composite, parental education) favoured the ABA group and were not accounted for, while other unaccounted for differences favouring the ABA group were just short of being significant (e.g., the ABA group was younger at intake). None of the between-group differences at intake favoured the nursery group.  The authors also made no attempt to account for gender. The nursery group had a higher percentage (33%) of females than the ABA group (4%). In my view (and apparently, in the authors' view), this isn't a major issue and if anything--according to the lore that autistic females are at a disadvantage--this difference would again favour the ABA group. The ABA group also had the advantage of receiving a significantly more intensive intervention than the nursery group, both at the outset of treatment and at follow-up, with the ABA group at ~33hrs/wk (range 18-40) and the nursery group at ~26hrs/wk (range 15-30). Within each group, intensity of intervention did not change from the outset to follow-up. That is, the children's need for services did not decrease over the course of about two years. The nursery group received little in the way of 1:1 intervention (6hrs/wk average, compared to the ABA group, where the full ~33hrs/wk  was 1:1). Because they received a more intensive intervention, the ABA group also received a significantly higher total number of intervention hours than did the nursery group--an average of 3415 hours versus 2266 hours per child. This is a difference of 1149 hours favouring the ABA group.  Using the average intensity of intervention for the ABA group, the ABA group received an equivalent of 35 weeks more in the way of intervention time than the nursery group children. Using the average intensity of intervention received by the nursery group, the nursery group received an equivalent of 44 weeks less in the way of intervention time than the ABA group children. That is, for the amount of intervention to be equivalent in both groups, the nursery group children would have had to receive an additional 44 weeks of intervention (at their average intensity of intervention). On the other hand, this study found no relationship whatsoever between intensity of intervention and any outcome measure. This is keeping in mind that the range of intensity in the ABA group was 18-40hrs/wk. In my  IMFAR poster this year , I mentioned the failure of the ABA literature to relate higher intensity of ABA-based interventions with better outcomes, and in Dr Howlin's study, that failure continues. Another factor that had no effect on outcomes was age at intake. Whether the children were younger or older at intake, across the range from 23 to 54 months, made no difference to how well they did. The popular if not ubiquitous contention that, when it comes to autism interventions, \"earlier is better\" has failed--again--to be supported by evidence from a controlled trial (for a previous failure, right up to intake at age 7, see Eikeseth et al., 2002, 2007).  And regardless of the ABA group starting with an average IQ well within the \"high-functioning\" range (indeed, the intake IQ here for the ABA group is the same as the  follow-up  IQ in Lovaas, 1987), after ~2 years of intensive ABA, all children in this group were still receiving ABA services and none was in a mainstream school without 1:1 assistance. This is also regardless that almost one-third of the ABA group did not have the specific diagnosis of autism at intake, instead being assigned a subthreshold \"ASD\" diagnosis. On average, neither group did well. They both made progress in age-equivalent scores but, as the abstract reports, standard scores changed little. Individuals either did well or did poorly, and this was unrelated to which kind of intervention they received, the intensity of intervention, or the age at which intervention began. This is similar to what was found in a recent Canadian observational study (Eaves & Ho, 2004).  Dr Howlin's study, like all studies, has weaknesses and limitations (and of course I want a lot more information about practically everything), some of which are addressed by the authors. I find it ironic that the authors argue for autism-specialized services by citing Cohen et al. (2006). While it is difficult to compare across studies, it could be argued that the control group in Cohen et al. (2006), which received completely inadequate services that no one should recommend (generic segregated special education of low intensity), fared better by the usual standards than  both  groups--the ABA group and the nursery group--receiving autism-specialized services in Dr Howlin's study. Dr Howlin and colleagues also fail to point out that when unmatched intake variables are accounted for in Cohen et al. (2006), the few significant differences between groups (ABA vs generic segregated special education) in all but one outcome measure (classroom placement) disappear.  Dr Howlin and colleagues conclude that: Our data support the growing consensus that no one intervention for children with ASD is universally superior to all others ( NIASA, 2003 ).  My own conclusion is one  I've arrived at before : after more than 60 years of autism research, encompassing the colossal existing autism intervention literature, researchers still cannot scientifically claim to know how to help autistic individuals (Volkmar et al., 2004). The best adult outcomes reported in the autism literature continue to belong to individuals who grew up before the current era of early interventions and who as children met the narrowest, strictest autism diagnostic criteria ever devised (Dawson et al., in press).  I'm prepared to agree with Dr Howlin that autism-specific services are important. But even the evidence Dr Howlin and colleagues drum up in support of these services glaringly reveals how poorly autism research has served the interests of autistics. Even if you leave out ethical concerns that would be paramount with any non-autistic population, the major currently-popularized and -marketed autism educational interventions (as opposed to non-popularized non-marketed science-based approaches; see Aldred et al., 2004; Gernsbacher, 2006) leave little to choose from.

{"date": "Friday, June 15, 2007", "body": "\nBack from the far-away land of deadlines with some very-belated information from IMFAR (International Meeting for Autism Research) 2007, and some thoughts about researching autism interventions. I saw two presentations involving data from early ABA-based interventions at IMFAR this year. Both studies are community-based.  A Canadian study was presented by Isabel Smith of Dalhousie (the abstract is  here ). Her ongoing study involves children in a government-funded ABA program in Nova Scotia. She was presenting data after one year for 27 autistic children with an average age just over 4yrs at intake, 6 of whom are described as \"non-verbal\".  Dr Smith reported improvements in various measures, 6 and 12 months after the children started in their ABA program. Does this mean the chosen ABA program is \"effective\"? It looks like we'll never find out, because there is no intention of ever having a control group. Dr Smith cited ethical considerations as to why a control group was unthinkable.  That's a familiar argument: ABA-based interventions are known to be effective, so denying any autistic children the benefit of an ABA program is unethical. This is a subject in itself which I hope to get back to. In this case, there's also the greater context: Dr Smith's study is an offshoot of the Nova Scotia government's decision to provide ABA-based interventions to autistic children in NS. First, the decision was made to fund the intervention (that is, provide a public program). Then the idea was to study it, once it was in place, to see if it worked.  So assigning children to a group that would be denied what had already become a government-provided program was out of the question. So far as I can tell, the utility of a non-randomized controlled trial (allowing for parents who might choose a different program for their autistic children) was discarded. Ergo--the effectiveness of this government-funded ABA program will be determined solely by an uncontrolled trial. This is now a CIHR-funded study. And it all sounds like great news for autism advocates. ABA programs are indeed considered so effective--by governments, researchers, the CIHR, etc.--that controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of an ABA program to another program are rejected as unethical. But the ABA program being funded by the NS government, and being studied in Dr Smith's uncontrolled trial, is a non-intensive, 15hrs/wk PRT (Pivotal Response Training) program. While PRT has some scientific support, there has never been a major controlled trial of PRT as a comprehensive autism intervention. So there has never been a major controlled trial of PRT as it is being studied and funded in NS. Regardless, non-intensive PRT is being assumed to be effective as a comprehensive intervention, in the absence of any evidence for this, such that any experimental design that risks being informative about its effectiveness is considered unethical.  Dr Smith's study is a ringing endorsement of the low/no standards of science and ethics that autism advocates have vigorously and successfully demanded for autistics. It is perfect evidence of why, in the presence of a massive bulk of autism intervention research, researchers still cannot scientifically claim to know how to help autistic individuals (Volkmar et al., 2004). The other community-based ABA study was from the UK. It was presented with remarkable efficiency by Patricia Howlin. You can find the abstract  here . This study included an experimental group of 28 preschool children in early intensive ABA programs, and a control group of 16 children in \"autism specific nursery provision\" which, unlike intensive ABA programs, is fully funded by the UK government. Because this is a community study, the groups were not randomly assigned. Outcomes after one and two years were compared. Dr Howlin showed graphed data from the experimental group kids first. As a group, they clearly improved over time in the chosen measures--just like the kids in Isabel Smith's study. Beside these data, she then added the data from the control kids. It looked the same as the ABA kids' data. And indeed, she found no significant difference in outcome measures between groups after two years. Instead, she found large individual differences among the children, regardless of which group they were in. Dr Howlin presented this data graphically.  Having presented her own data, she went on to present a mini-meta-study (well, I can't think of a better name for it) of ABA group designs. She started with the long list of how these studies are inconsistent with each other in multiple aspects of their design. Then she graphed how widely (and wildly) results in various measures differ among the ABA group designs where these data are available.  Dr Howlin's ABA study is in press at JCPP (Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry), but not yet available online. I'd like to see the paper before I comment any more on her actual findings. But if her findings hold up under scrutiny, they will be evidence of how autistics have been ill-served by the widely-accepted and -practiced autism advocacy position that true experimental designs--and more generally the scientific and ethical standards that serve to protect and benefit all non-autistics--are not something autistics deserve.

Poster presented at the International Meeting for Autism Research. Seattle, WA.  You can find it as a pdf linked to  this page . This page also provides the full text for the excerpts of Leaf's testimony. These excerpts aren't clear on the small pdf of the poster, unlike on the original ppt version (if anyone wants the ppt version, they can write to me). It is such an unconventional poster that I'm pretty sure we were all surprised it was accepted for IMFAR. The information we put forward raises a lot of interesting questions at multiple levels. One of the most basic questions for me was, does this kind of information belong in a venue like IMFAR? Is it autism research? The answer was yes (at least so far). This leads to more questions, about what to do with the information we have, and about what may or may not be accurate information in this case. We don't, e.g., know who's right, or how many hours forty hours is. But for now it remains a possibility that if accurate information had been provided by Lovaas and colleagues going back 20 years, re treatment intensity in the experimental group in Lovaas (1987), then the subsequent behaviour analytic research in autism may have looked somewhat different than it does now.  Setting aside all the uncertainties and unknowns (in the absence of accurate information from the authors in question), it seems that there should be agreement on one point. Accurate information may not always serve the many vested interests of scientists, service providers, advocacy groups, politicians, and lobbyists. But accurate information always serves the real-life interests of autistics. Then it's a matter of deciding on priorities. IMFAR was overwhelming, as usual (this was also the first IMFAR where I was involved in more than one presented study as an author), and this year I have a variety of post-IMFAR deadlines to make things a bit more challenging.

{"date": "Tuesday, April 03, 2007", "body": "\nThe major media have been buzzing with stories about the  crushing burden autistics place on non-autistics . This reporting stems in part from the journal publication of data also published in a 2006 book (with the unintentionally ironic title of \"Understanding Autism\"), summarizing every autistic life as a vast financial liability. This is also partly the fanfare surrounding the release of  Canada's Senate Committee autism treatment funding report , which is poetically called  \"Pay Now or Pay Later\".   This title resonates with the advertising slogans of \"diagnostic teams\" in India,  as recently reported in The Times . These diagnostic teams promise to eliminate disabled children--those lacking a Y chromosome--before birth, thus entirely relieving families of the massive financial burden of raising a female child. And they provide a compelling cost-benefit analysis in their slogans:  \"pay 600 rupees now, save 50,000 rupees later\u201d The media have also been buzzing about the latest Autism Speaks creation, the  Interactive Autism Network . This network, like its sponsor, was created without any autistic input whatsoever, and is likely to continue that way. Non-autistic parents of autistic children, in contrast, are welcomed as essential and expert collaborators. In her most recent editorial,  The True Meaning of Research Participation , Association for Psychological Science President Morton Ann Gernsbacher has written a powerful antidote to these two related problems: the wholesale exclusion of autistics from any decisions related to autism research, and the escalating rhetoric relegating autistics to the role of non-autistic person's burden.  Here she provides insight into how these two aspects of prejudice may go hand in glove: It takes just a cursory stroll through history to view the shocking collage of groups deemed incapable of stepping up to the research plate. In 20th century psychological science alone, we have Mary Whiton Calkins, the brilliant prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of William James who, by lack of a Y chromosome, was denied her PhD at Harvard (but who later became APA\u2019s first female president). It\u2019s quite unlikely that APA\u2019s founder and first (male) president, G. Stanley Hall, believed that members of ethnic minority groups would be suitable research collaborators, given his disturbing attribution of \u201cadolescent races\u201d who \u201cwould be better in mind, body, and morals if they knew no education.\u201d Maybe we shouldn't be surprised that when females and non-whites were written off as unqualified to collaborate in research, they were also judged to be burdens and dependents on their natural superiors--as in \"the white man's burden\".  While it makes me blush, I strongly recommend that you follow  the link  to Dr Gernsbacher's column and read the whole thing, and contemplate who is a burden on whom. No one has yet calculated the costs to autistics, and to society, of the current widespread autism advocacy effort to create a world where there are no autistic people at all.  The truly staggering costs of this effort, and its consequences and byproducts, are unlikely ever to be calculated. After all, autistics are now routinely judged as having and being nothing to lose. The only way we can possibly benefit society is to stop existing--surely, society can pay even less if the existence of all autistics is prevented? Surely society would be better, if only us suboptimal types who are dragging down society  receded into history and vanished ? Unless autism advocacy--the autistic person's burden--is successfully supplanted by genuine science- and ethics-based efforts to assist autistic people, we will never find out what autistics can achieve and contribute, in a society where it is okay to be autistic.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismvox.com/the-cost-to-society/", "http://www.quicktopic.com/27/H/vJvhV4fDnBgw7/m5832", "http://www.parl.gc.ca/39/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/soci-e/rep-e/repfinmar07-e.pdf", "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1403517.ece", "http://www.autismvox.com/autism-vox-joins-the-ian/", "http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2147", "http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2147", "http://www.autismvox.com/300-150-94-history-and-autism-go-to-the-movies/"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2007/04/autistic-persons-burden.html", "title": "\n"},

As I wrote  in my first post here , autism advocacy is the widespread effort to make the world as free of autism--that is, of autistic people--as possible. According to autism advocates, autism research must support their autism advocacy needs and agendas. Otherwise, it should not be conducted much less reported.

And in deference to ubiquitous and anti-scientific autism advocacy prejudices re autistic savants, I've left out the entire savant and hyperlexia literatures, which would add considerably to the above rogues. I've left out studies which have been presented at major research conferences, but have not yet been published--which means that well-known names (in autism or other fields) like Ullman, Mostofsky, Joseph and Strauss have for the time being been spared rogue status. If I had more time, I'd list all the rogue researchers' rogue universities, and I'm sure anyone versed in autism research can spot the knight--as well as the famous behaviour analyst--among the rogues. I've also left out the problem of the impressive heap of findings in the peer-reviewed literature showing autistics performing as well as their non-autistic controls. Autism advocates making sweeping \"autism reality\" assumptions about the functioning levels, \"severity\", etc., of the autistic participants whose strengths were advertantly or inadvertantly revealed by the rogues will be displaying their own unfamiliarity with the published literature in autism.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2007/03/autism-research-rogues-gallery_28.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 12, 2007", "body": "\nI'm grateful to Harold Doherty for providing me with a distraction from being pulverized at the Tribunal. Mr Doherty is  doing science again , with the usual autism advocacy standards. This time, Mr Doherty takes on a \"myth\" about the intake IQs of the experimental group in Lovaas (1987).   So let's look at those intake IQs.  I'm not going to launch into a lecture about deviation vs ratio IQs. This is a relevant issue here, but it can largely be circumvented by using the measure Lovaas (1987) used at intake, the PMA (prorated mental age), and its derived ratio IQs. All the sources I cite are peer-reviewed journal articles with Ivar Lovaas in the authorship, and the information I provide can be verified from these articles. Using the reported PMA in Lovaas (1987), the mean intake IQ in the experimental group is 63. This is an average score in the \"mildly retarded\" range.  In the \"Method\" section, Lovaas (1987) also reports that, at intake, 2 experimental group children were in the normal range of intelligence (IQ 70 or more); none was in the \"mildly retarded\" range (IQ 50-69); 7 were in the \"moderately retarded\" range (IQ 35-49); and 10 were in the \"severely retarded\" range (IQ 20-34). None was in the \"profoundly retarded\" range (IQ of less than 20). Dr Lovaas also reports that this distribution of IQ scores is \"identical to that for Control Group 1\". But--even if you assign the normal range children an IQ of 100--I haven't been able to find any report of the range of ratio IQs for the whole experimental group--and also assign all the other children to the highest possible scores in their respective categories (7 children with 49 IQ; 10 children with 34 IQ), this does not even approach a group average of 63. Instead, the average is 46.  It is statistically improbable that all those kids had, at intake, the highest scores within their assigned ranges, and it also looks impossible for the two normal range children to have ratio IQs as high as 100 (this would be inconsistent with reported deviation IQs; McEachin et al., 1993). But even this exercise in trying to produce the highest possible average intake IQ falls well short (17 points) of the reported average.  In the \"Results\" section, Lovaas (1987) reports that at intake, there were 10 children in the \"moderate to severe range\", as opposed to the 17 (\"moderate\" plus \"severe\" children) reported earlier in this paper. Smith et al. (1993) report that 5 of the 19 children in Control Group 1 in Lovaas (1987) were \"high-functioning\", that is, had an IQ of 70 or more at intake. This contradicts the account in Lovaas (1987), where it is reported that only 2 of the 19 children in both the experimental group and Control Group 1 had IQs in the normal range (70 or more). Smith and Lovaas (1997) report a total of 9 children (experimental group and Control Group 1) who have IQs of 75 or more. If this figure is correct, and if 5 of these children were indeed in Control Group 1 (assuming none of the kids with IQs over 70 had IQs under 75...), then 4 must have been in the experimental group. This leaves open the question of whether the experimental group might have included more than 4 children with IQs of 70 or more. Smith et al. (1997) correctly report that all children with ratio IQs of less than 37 were excluded from Lovaas (1987). That is, none of the experimental group children in Lovaas (1987) was in the \"severely retarded\" range at intake. This is contrary to what is stated in Lovaas (1987), where it is reported that 10 children--the majority--are in this range. Lovaas and Smith (1988) add that the average intake IQ of the 9 children who achieved \"normal functioning\" in Lovaas (1987) is \"slightly under 70\". In fact it is 70 (69.7), which would be considered (just) in the normal range. And \"in the normal range\" is another way to say \"high-functioning\". Summary? Lovaas (1987) does not include any autistic children whose intake IQs are in the \"severe\" and \"profound\" ranges. The average experimental group intake IQ is in the \"mild\" range, and the average for those children who achieved normal functioning is (just) in the normal--\"high functioning\"--range. And the distribution of intake IQ scores is incorrectly (and inconsistently) reported in Lovaas (1987). These are data I absorbed long ago and carried around for a long time. Only when I saw Mr Doherty's latest foray into science was I reminded to cough them up. Autism advocates who use websites as authoritative sources miss all the fun (and avoid all the hard work) of looking at data from primary sources. As usual, any factual criticisms are welcome--and if anyone can find (I'm sure it's right in front of me somewhere...) a reported range of ratio IQs (not deviation IQs) for the full experimental group in Lovaas (1987), you'll be awarded a trip to that Tribunal hearing (or maybe not).

{"date": "Wednesday, March 07, 2007", "body": "\nThe 2007 International Meeting for Autism Research (Seattle this year) schedule for oral and poster presentations has been posted  here . I'm involved in three studies at IMFAR this year. Here are the abstracts for two of them: Pervasive Developmental Disorders Specialized Clinic, Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies Hospital, University of Montreal  HOW MANY HOURS IS FORTY HOURS? RANGE OF TREATMENT INTENSITY IN LOVAAS (1987)  M. Dawson, L. Mottron  Background:  40hrs/wk of one-to-one treatment--the reported intensity of ABA-based intervention received by the experimental group in Lovaas (1987) and McEachin, Smith and Lovaas (1993)--is a benchmark in autism research. Objective:  To compare accounts of hrs/wk received by the experimental group in Lovaas (1987) and McEachin, Smith and Lovaas (1993). Method:  We compared detailed 2004 sworn legal testimony from a behavior analyst (Leaf) directly involved in treatment of 10 of the 19 experimental group children reported in Lovaas (1987) and McEachin, Smith and Lovaas (1993), to descriptions in published articles authored by Lovaas, Smith and/or McEachin. Results:  34 published descriptions of hrs/wk in the experimental group authored by Lovaas, Smith and/or McEachin, report 40hrs/wk with no range; 4 descriptions (including 1 in both Lovaas, 1987, and McEachin, Smith & Lovaas, 1993) specify 40hrs/wk was a minimum (e.g. \"40 hours or more per week\", \"more than 40 hours\"); 7 specify an average of 40hrs/wk, including the only account by Leaf; 3 specify \"normal functioning\" children received 40hrs/wk; 1 is ambiguous; 2 specify \"approximately\" 40hrs/wk; and the rest are unqualified. Leaf testified (from Wynberg et al. v. Ontario; Leaf, pp. 16687-16692 [Compendium, Vol. II, Tab 23, pp. 692-697]) under oath that 40 hrs/wk was a group average; range in the experimental group was 18 to \"in the 50 range\" and that 2 of the 9 \"normal functioning\" children received 18 hrs/wk which diminished over time. Conclusion:  Leaf's testimony questions the influential premise that high intensity of treatment in Lovaas (1987) was essential in achieving \"normal functioning\". In the current absence of ABA controlled trials correlating treatment intensity with outcome measures, and considering the landmark status of Lovaas (1987) and its follow-up, we suggest that accurate data re treatment intensity and its relation with outcome measures be provided by the authors.

Gernsbacher  Background:  Recent findings of discrepancies between intelligence in autism as measured by Wechsler and Raven's Progressive Matrices (Dawson et al, in press) lead to the reconsideration of established relations between variables characterizing the autistic phenotype and intelligence level reached.  Objectives:  To establish how early developmental milestones and cross-sectional adaptive level predicts the intelligence level measured by various instruments, including the Raven's Progressive Matrices.  Methods:  All measures were extracted from the socio-demographic data of Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies Hospital's database, which contains diagnostic and cognitive information on approximately 200 ADI and ADOS-G positive autistics. Correlations were computed between age at first words/phrases-word and other ADI items at age 4-5 and subtests, subscales and global Wechsler intelligence level (WISC-III and WAIS-III), Raven intelligence level, and Vineland adaptation level in school-age children and adults.  Results:  Age at first words/phrases was not significantly correlated with intelligence level achieved later in childhood or adulthood, whether measured with Wechsler Scales or Raven's Progressive Matrices. Furthermore, ADI scores (social, communication and repetitive behaviours) was not significantly correlated with intelligence in adulthood. Conclusion:  The age at which first words or phrases are spoken by in autistic children does not predict intelligence level achieved later in childhood or adulthood. Also, ADI scores, often taken to index the so-called \"severity\" of autistic symptoms, does not predict cognitive outcome in adulthood.

This passage, reflecting on priorities and presumptions rampant in autism research, is from a 2004 review. It is quite remarkable and difficult to fathom that we currently have more functional imaging data about how the autistic brain processes a face or a theory of mind than we do about the way it processes, say, location, colour, orientation, or spatial frequency; at what level of processing do the perceptual and cognitive abnormalities begin? It is also important to recognise that absence of behavioural performance or functional activation does not necessarily imply incapacity of the corresponding brain subsystems. Rather, an apparent lack may be due to failure to engage an intact capacity. The proper stimuli or experimental paradigm can bring out such hidden abilities.

{"date": "Sunday, March 04, 2007", "body": "\nMy Canadian Human Rights Tribunal case resumes hearings tomorrow. We previously (in 2006) had eight hearing days. Ten more are now scheduled. This is the first autism-related case to be referred for a hearing to the CHRT. The referring body is the Canadian Human Rights Commission, which investigates complaints under the Canadian Human Rights Act. I had a previous case at the CHRC involving the same Respondent (my employer, Canada Post), which was rapidly settled in my favour. But the current case has proceeded extremely slowly and arduously. Before it was finally referred to the CHRT (three years after the complaint was signed), my current case had involved two investigations (this is unusual), as well as two formal written apologies to me from the CHRC, one from the Chief Commissioner's Office. I frequently encountered autism advocacy views in those I had to deal with at the CHRC. This twice had the effect of killing my case, and twice I had to make formal within-CHRC complaints, which were found to be justified. At the CHRT, the CHRC is also acting as a party in my case, meaning that these hearings involve three parties--Canada Post, my employer; the CHRC; and me. Are you confused yet? You should be. At the CHRT, the CHRC is supposed to represent the \"public interest\". This raises interesting questions in the area of autism. In my case, the CHRC has largely been adversarial. This is not surprising, given that the \"public interest\" in autism is in Canada defined by autism advocates. According to the jurisprudence resulting from autism advocacy, autistics are not even human (unqualified for \"membership in the human community\"), and therefore do not have human rights, unless we have undergone unlimited ABA/IBI starting very early in life. As autism advocates argued successfully in both the  Wynberg  and  Auton  trials, only through ABA/IBI can autistics become human, and acquire the rights guaranteed for all non-autistic Canadians. An issue at the CHRT is whether ABA-deprived autistics are human. I am representing myself at the CHRT. I am a truly appalling lawyer, when it comes to saying things in hearings. I can write an argument if I have a lot of examples to work with. In this case, I produced a mediation brief and a statement of particulars without really knowing what either was or what they should consist of. But I am at a total loss when it comes to speaking in a hearing. It doesn't help that I've been treated like a spectator rather than a party. It is extremely difficult just to be a witness. I am the only witness on my side of the case. I do not know how to call witnesses at the CHRT, which has idiosyncratic and arbitrary (made up as you go along) rules that diverge from more standard forms of litigation, and could not find out from anyone.  Human rights lawyers in Canada, including those few with experience at the CHRC and CHRT in disability issues, have supported or represented autism advocates in ABA-related litigation. They are not interested in helping an autistic to argue that ABA-deprived autistics are human, and contribute to society because we're autistic, not in spite of this.  Many issues in this case have been decided already, and I am not sure if I should continue. I am quite sure that the decision in this case will be harmful to autistics. Its only advantage will be that it will reflect \"autism reality\", that is, the overwhelming success of autism advocates in disseminating false and pejorative information about autistics, in spreading fear and dread of autistic people (this being a central issue in my case), and in ensuring that autistics are unquestioningly regarded as undeserving of recognized standards of science and ethics (including professional ethics). One of many issues involved is accommodation. I asked to use a simple accommodation I had used previously at work. In spite of this accommodation costing Canada Post nothing (in time, trouble, or money), and in spite of it having been granted without question previously, it was this time refused. This should be an easy issue. This was not an accommodation that could cause Canada Post \"undue hardship\"--the legal criterion that allows an employer or service provider to refuse accommodation. However, I asked to be accommodated in the CHRT hearings in similarly easy ways, and this has been refused by the CHRT member hearing my case. This member (the CHRT equivalent of a judge) characterized my requests as unreasonable. An employer can't be ordered to behave better than the CHRT. So a  de facto  decision re accommodation has been made, and that decision is that even easy, cost-free accommodations for autistics can and should be denied as being unreasonable. The absence of the simple accommodations I asked for has caused chaos in the hearings. For example, I'm not allowed to communicate in text. So when I was unable to speak, I had to leave the room. Any attempt to make the hearings possible to endure has been, and no doubt will continue to be, judged as my being unreasonable or rude. I do not expect to be able to finish the remaining 10 days of hearings in this situation, but I will at least show up. The  de facto  decision re accommodation, and my own extreme incompetence in this arena, are far from the only problems which are likely to result in a harmful decision. Others include the CHRC investigation process being a CHRT-protected haven for human rights violations. I don't have the time (or the brains, right now) to fully explain this here, but this fact alone (a respondent is free to grossly violate the rights of a complainant, in ways that can put the complainant in danger, with impunity so long as this is within a CHRC investigation) means I will never make a CHRC complaint again. But the major problem is that the CHRT condones and embraces autism advocacy. The CHRT has a Code of Conduct for its members (judges), which states, it must be recognized that members of the Tribunal have been appointed because of their experience, expertise and interest in, and sensitivity to, human rights. This requirment--for expertise in and sensitivity to human rights--is stated in the law itself (Canadian Human Rights Act). One of the CHRT's current members (judges) is Michel Doucet, who is from New Brunswick. Mr Doucet was first appointed to the CHRT (by the federal cabinet) in 2002. In 2001, Mr Doucet made statments in the media, supporting the Auton trial decision. He was commissioned by Autism Society New Brunswick to write a report about this decision and the rights of autistics, among other things. This report appears to have been funded at least in part by the now-defunct Canada Court Challenges program, and is (or was) available free from this government body. I first found out about this report in 2002, when my then-MP received a copy, and copied me with a letter she wrote in consequence to the health minister. I knew the name of the report's author, but I did not, until this past summer, connect the Michel Doucet who wrote this widely-distributed report with the Michel Doucet who is a current CHRT member. You can find Mr Doucet's report  here . It is prime autism advocacy, uncritically quoting and embellishing on the Auton trial decision, equating autism with cancer and AIDS, and claiming, as was claimed in Auton, that autistics are doomed and just naturally belong in institutions unless we receive Lovaas ABA from an early age. Mr Doucet's embellishments include giving the behaviour analyst Glen Davies (PhD, not MD) status as a \"medical expert\". This is in the context of Dr Davies' statement that it is wrong to provide autistics with support when a treatment which promises to \"recover\" or \"cure\" half of us is available. Mr Doucet repeats this statement twice. Mr Doucet's rationale is seen in his distortion of the the Supreme Court of Canada decision in the Eldridge case. Here is what Eldridge says: Persons with disabilities have too often been excluded from the labour force, denied access to opportunities for social interaction and advancement, subjected to invidious stereotyping and relegated to institutions [...]  This historical disadvantage has to a great extent been shaped and perpetuated by the notion that disability is an abnormality or flaw.  As a result, disabled persons have not generally been afforded the \u201cequal concern, respect and consideration\u201d that s. 15(1) of the Charter demands.  Instead, they have been subjected to paternalistic attitudes of pity and charity, and their entrance into the social mainstream has been conditional upon their emulation of ablebodied norms [...] Here is Mr Doucet's distortion, complete with the kind of offensive language (\"afflicted\" etc.) which is featured in his report: The history of people afflicted with autism in Canada is largely one of exclusion, marginalization and institutionalization. They have been denied access to opportunities for social interaction and advancement and have been subjected to invidious stereotyping and in more cases than other relegated to institutions.  This historical disadvantage has to a great extent been shaped and perpetuated by the notion that autism is not a medical condition and that treatment for autism is not a medically necessary service.  As a result people who suffer from autism have not generally been afforded the equal concern, respect and consideration that s. 15(1) demands.  Individuals who suffer from autism have been subjected to paternalistic attitudes of pity and charity and that their entrance into the social mainstream has been denied. In both quotes, I've added emphasis in blue. Mr Doucet argues that autistics are sick, and it is the failure of society to recognize that autism is a disease (just like cancer) and must be gotten rid of via \"medical\" treatment (that is, Lovaas ABA) that constitutes the denial of the human rights of autistics. His very selective distortions of Eldridge show that he has no problem with the \"medical\" treatment he promotes having the stated purpose of requiring autistics to \"emulate able-bodied norms\". In Mr Doucet's report, autistics are not like the disabled people described in Eldridge, who have rights and value and dignity and humanity as disabled people. No, autistics are just sick. We are indeed abnormal and flawed (afflicted and suffering), and only \"medical\" treatment requiring us to emulate healthy, non-autistic people can save us from our tragic doom. Mr Doucet's views resonate with the entirely negative views of autism and autistic people that Canada Post has embraced and acted on.  Mr Doucet is not hearing my case, but his publicly available work represents what the CHRT considers to be expertise in and sensitivity to the human rights of autistics. It is unreasonable to expect an employer to behave better than the CHRT.  I've found it striking how many people have not been able to see the problem, which would be obvious if the issue weren't autism. Possibly, the problem is that you cannot imagine this happening in any other area. You cannot imagine a lawyer who writes a report full of false and pejorative statements about gay people being appointed to the CHRT, so it becomes very difficult to imagine the consequences were such a member appointed, no matter whether this member heard cases having to do with homosexuality. It is the standards of the CHRT that are displayed when members are appointed and have their appointments renewed, as has Mr Doucet. If the CHRT embraces (as expertise in and sensitivity to human rights) grossly false characterizations of and prejudicial stereotypes about homosexuals--or autistics--there is no way for the CHRT to hold an employer accountable for holding identical or equivalent views--in my case, autism advocacy views--and acting on them.  Canada Post has, after all, done what Mr Doucet and so many in Canada are  applauded for doing--including applause from Canada's government--in this era of autism advocacy. They have joined the fight against autism.   [NOTE: The eminent Canadian autism advocate and lawyer, Harold Doherty, has blogged about this case.

{"date": "Saturday, February 03, 2007", "body": "\nWhile it's going to look like I'm singling out two specific parents, that isn't the purpose. They are just two of the many available examples of what I want to illustrate. There are many more similar examples--not only reported in the media, but also in the science, where the observers are not parents but behaviour analysts and cognitive scientists. The first parent is the Conservative MP Mike Lake, who has talked about his brilliant autistic son in the media and in the House of Commons. The first I read about Mr Lake's son Jaden (who, at age 11, communicates via keyboard) was in a National Post story. Here is Mr Lake describing Jaden at about age 2yrs: We could tell he was a smart kid, in terms of numbers and the way he played with letter toys. But he would sit in a corner and play and you could not get his attention at all. We wondered if he was deaf, but if you went into a different room and put Winnie the Pooh on television, he'd hear it. It looks like Jaden has taught himself both some degree of numeracy and some degree of literacy--all by age 2. As is characteristic of autistics, he does not orient to stimuli in typical ways, and is attracted to the kinds of information from which he learns well. In the  House of Commons , Mr Lake elaborates on Jaden's extraordinary abilities, evident from a very early age: Between 18 months and 2 years old Jaden started doing some pretty amazing things. Like just about every kid his age, he had one of those foam alphabets that fit inside a foam frame. One day on a whim Debi took the frame away and left him with just a jumbled pile of letters. Jaden proceeded to put the letters in order just as fast as we would do it the very first time. Then to our amazement, a friend of ours mixed up the letters in a pile and put out the letter Z. Jaden, without missing a beat, put the letters in reverse order Z, Y, X, W, V and so on just as fast as he had done forward. This shows that Jaden has learned a great deal from his environment, that he is responsive to this environment, and that he responds to the actions of others (his way of communicating and playing). But Mr Lake again sees problems: As amazing as things like this were, during his second year we started to notice some other things that caused us some concern regarding Jaden's development. He was extremely content playing on his own with little or no interest in playing with other kids or interacting with adults. His speech was not really developing beyond the first initial few sounds and he was very focused on patterns, often spending an inordinate amount of time lining up his videos or stacking cups in perfect order. He paid little attention when we tried to talk to him or play with him. We would have thought he had a hearing impairment except for the fact that if he heard a video he liked start up in another room at very low volume, he would instantly stop what he was doing and go to watch it. So what is the solution? This is Mr Lake describing Jaden's ABA program in the National Post: The first thing they did was sit Jaden at a table and put a spoon in front of him and ask him to hand them the spoon. They would do that six hours a day, for days and weeks. The next stage, they would put a spoon and a fork down and go through the whole process again. It is very tedious and intensive. But his pediatrician said that he is entirely different due to ABA. He's now one of the most amazing kids -- he will look you in the eye and he will understand you when you ask him to do something. The second example, where ABA is also said to have changed everything, is from  Autism Vox . Here is the first part of the first comment on a post about ABA and recovery: My daughter has made great strides with ABA therapy as well. I mean I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question of the effectiveness of it for enabling autistic children to learn. Every single thing she knows, she learned from ABA. This is fact. Except for the things that seem to be her gifts. She spelled words with refrigerator magnets long before ABA therapy. She plays the piano almost in spite of ABA therapy. She taught herself to read without the use of ABA therapy. Adding and subtracting. She was obsessed with numbers and sequences of numbers before ABA. Having said that, she had no language before ABA, no eye contact, no social skills, absolutely ignored everyone and everything. This is really amazing though. My mother has a small dog. She babysat for Jodi for the first two years of her life. She started a not so good ABA home program in my mother\u2019s house where she spent the day. This dog never meant a thing to her. After ABA therapy, when we go to my mother\u2019s house she\u2019s afraid of the dog. It\u2019s weird. It\u2019s almost like before ABA that dog didn\u2019t even exist. I know this is subjective, but prior to ABA she seemed much less engaged in the world. Much less is an understatement. She seemed like she wasn\u2019t even there and when something was thrust upon her like someone saying hello up close that she couldn\u2019t avoid, she\u2019d cover her ears. ABA changed all those things in 1 year.  This is how I responded on Autism Vox: An autistic who teaches herself (it looks like, very early) to read and spell\u2013has \u201cno language\u201d and totally ignores everything? And she doesn\u2019t just teach herself to read and spell, but plays the piano (in spite of ABA\u2013because ABA won\u2019t allow her to learn how she learns well), teaches herself to add and subtract, etc? And this girl is oblivious? And since when does written language mean \u201cno language\u201d? And how does a girl who is totally oblivious (according to the above, \u201cShe seemed like she wasn\u2019t even there\u201d\u2013the usual description of us as not really existing because we orient atypically to stimuli) teach herself how to read and spell, etc.? Even when autistics demonstrate clearly that there are ways in which we learn extraordinarily well (including learning language), because the way we learn is atypical, this is written off as \u201cshe wasn\u2019t even there\u201d and \u201cshe had no language before ABA\u201d. Therefore, she has to be completely altered by ABA programs, in order to persuade her entourage that she is \u201cthere\u201d and that she can learn. My view is that ABA \u201cworks\u201d when autistic children are totally written off (\u201cnot there\u201d, oblivious, \u201cno language\u201d, etc). In this case, at least ABA will demonstrate to parents that their child exists and can learn\u2013by giving the child \u201cright\u201d non-autistic behaviours, and eliminating \u201cwrong\u201d autistic behaviours. This is even though the \u201cwrong\u201d autistic behaviours previously resulted in extraordinarly learning by this child. This is even though the child learns with much greater difficulty in ABA, and in a much more limited way, than she would if provided with the materials and opportunities to learn how she has amply demonstrated she learns best. But even though this use of ABA \u201cworks\u201d (see above\u2013after ABA, the parents notice that the child is present and sentient, and then they credit all progress to ABA), this is fundamentally unethical. A child should not be put in a program to compromise her learning (how she learned to read, spell, do arithmetic, play the piano, etc.) in order to deal with parents who, against all evidence, decide she is oblivious because she is not like them.  It is some kind of tribute to autism advocacy (Mr Lake read \"Let Me Hear Your Voice\"--a book which describes autistics as being  non-sentient, inhuman, and dead --just before Jaden was officially diagnosed) that so many parents view their autistic children the way the parents above did. I was asked once if there were circumstances in which I might consider that ABA programs really should be used with autistic kids. I gave examples where autistic children are described as, and assumed to be, non-sentient. When autistics are described and treated as non-sentient, this is now routinely praised by autism advocates as \"autism reality\", as being a true representation of how devastating it is to have an autistic child. Being considered non-sentient can be dangerous for any child. Autistic adults also routinely get described and treated as non-sentient (this has happened to me), and this is definitely dangerous for us. If ABA programs result in parents altering their views to see their child as sentient, aware and able to learn, then the child's situation may not be as bad as it had been. But as I wrote above, this is not an ethically acceptable solution. The ethical course of action is to train parents to recognize that their child is sentient, responsive (to the environment, to other people), capable of learning (though not necessarily in typical ways), and communicative (ditto). Parents can then be trained to respond to their child's communication and learning. Interventions which train parents to be responsive (rather than \"directive\" and \"intrusive\") to their autistic children have demonstrated their success in several published peer-reviewed papers, including a randomized controlled trial (Aldred et al., 2004). But we live in a world where autism advocates deny that this kind of science even exists. Also, we live in a world where autism advocates use their power and influence to disseminate the \"facts\" that autistics can't communicate, learn or even be sentient outside of ABA programs. So is it better for an autistic child to be in an ABA program than to be treated as though non-sentient (unaware, unresponsive, incapable of learning, unable to communicate, etc.)? Why should this \"choice\" be imposed on anyone?  (Edit: And some parents whose autistic children receive optimal ABA services still continue to view these children as  non-sentient and doomed, and are applauded by autism advocates for expressing these \"autism reality\" views in the mass media .)

{"date": "Sunday, February 18, 2007", "body": "\nAutism advocates  trivialize autism . They do not take autism seriously. For example, compare autism advocacy to advocacy in other disability areas. Here is the Canadian Down Syndrome Society, defining Down syndrome: Down syndrome is a naturally occurring chromosomal arrangement that has always been a part of the human condition. The occurrence of Down syndrome is universal across racial and gender lines, and it is present in approximately one in 800 births in Canada. Down syndrome is not a disease, disorder, defect or medical condition. It is inappropriate and offensive to refer to people with Down syndrome as \"afflicted with\" or \"suffering from\" it. Down syndrome itself does not require either treatment or prevention. Autism, like Down syndrome, is a neurodevelopmental disability. According to autism advocates, the CDSS has fallen to the  siren song of DS . The failure of the CDSS to identify DS as a  terminal disease and blight on society, and their failure to deny the humanity of DS people , is a destructive and deluded squandering of the lives and futures of DS children. In the world outside of autism advocacy, CDSS takes DS seriously, and therefore considers that services for DS people should be asked for accurately, ethically, and respectfully. I did not get involved in autism advocacy issues by choice. Autistics in Canada live daily the consequences of autism advocacy, and those consequences include being put in danger. Having lived the consequences of autism advocacy, I wondered why autism advocates were unwilling or unable make their demands for services, whatever those services may be, accurately (with respect to the existing science), ethically, and respectfully. I also wondered why autism advocates demanded low or no standards of science and ethics for autistics, as opposed to the high standards that automatically protect and benefit themselves. A possible, evidence-based answer to these questions is that autism advocates don't take autism seriously. They have not bothered with the hard work of  slogging through primary sources , of critical thinking, of the comprehensive and impartial (in every sense) gathering of information that is the necessary foundation for ethical decisions. Autistics are just too appalling and  blighted and doomed. We aren't even human . We're not worth the bother--the hassle of seriously applying recognized standards of science and ethics. Instead, autism advocates equate autism with  terminal cancer . They have  wished their child had cancer instead of autism  (also see  this ). And they have said that  autism is worse than cancer because autism does not kill us . This autism advocacy staple has the purpose of spreading dread and horror of autism, of denying the worth of autistic lives, of informing Canadians that it is better to die painfully of cancer than to be autistic and alive.  Promoting autism as a degenerative disease process is also anti-scientific and unlikely to result in research leading to genuine help for autistic people. Similarly, models of autism premised on autistic brains being damaged versions of non-autistic brains have comprehensively failed (that includes Laurent Mottron's \"agnosia\" model). No deficit-based account of autism has (after 64 years of research) achieved any kind of consensus in the science, possibly because deficit-based accounts have so far made remarkably poor predictions. Autism advocates consider peer-reviewed papers reporting autistic abilities (found either intentionally or accidentally) to be romanticized and dangerous nonsense, misleading and uninformative. All findings in autism research should therefore (according to autism advocates) be interpreted as deficits or not interpreted--or reported--at all. Researchers who find and investigate autistic abilities should not be funded and their foolish and dangerous work should not be published or discussed or for that matter, allowed. For example, if peer-reviewed research shows that young autistic children--those who would popularly be considered \"severely autistic\", \"non-verbal\" and \"low-functioning\"--communicate competently but are persistently ignored by their typical parents (Keen, 2005) and teachers (Keen et al., 2005), then this science has surrendered to the deadly siren song of autism and must be discarded. This is even though, or rather, especially because it was demonstrated that these very young autistic children detect when their communication has failed, and make multiple efforts to repair this failure, including by using strategies considered too sophisticated for their presumed developmental level. Also (it only gets worse), earlier attempts to communicate by these autistic children were not problematic. It was only their later efforts, after earlier attempts had been ignored and the children were repeatedly forced to effortfully create repair strategies, that the children's attempts to communicate became problematic. To avoid romanticizing autism and squandering the lives and futures of children, autism advocates have rejected this obviously unacceptable research, and instead have forcefully promoted autistics as being non-communicative and non-responsive. This advocacy has been so successful that autistics are described this way  in the House of Commons . The full success of autism advocacy can also be seen when autistics are described  in the House of Commons  as \"violent\" and \"self-destructive\". Autism advocates are definitely onto something here. It is true that persistently describing and treating autistic children or any other kind of children as non-sentient--as non-communicative and non-responsive--will very likely result in their behaviour becoming problematic. In fact, very few adults deal gracefully with being persistently treated as though non-sentient. So this is an impressive show of the power and influence of autism advocacy, and its consequences. But is this taking autism seriously? Yes, autism advocacy is impressive in the area of spreading fear, dread, horror, and hatred of autism. Autism advocates have demanded that autism be seen as a horrific disease process or tumour, while simultaneously reducing autistics to collections of inadequate, inappropriate, maladaptive, repugnant, repulsive, etc., behaviours. These efforts have been successful. But promoting autistics as non-responsive and non-communicative is anti-scientific, unethical, and harmful. Associating violence with disability is no more accurate or acceptable than associating violence with race. The autism advocacy wholesale vilification of any science (now characterized as the killer rocky shore that breaks and destroys children) that fails to confirm their absolute certainties about autism is a trivialization of autism. It is the opposite of taking autism seriously. Autism advocates also trivialize autism by promoting ABA-based autism interventions as \"medically necessary\" autism treatment. This contradicts basic principles of ABA, the bulk of the behaviour analytic literature in autism, and particularly the work of Ivar Lovaas and colleagues (Lovaas, 1979; Lovaas and Smith, 1988, 1989; Lovaas, 1993; Lovaas, 2002; etc.). Autism advocates also place ABA-based autism interventions high above scrutiny or criticism. If I provide factual and verifiable criticisms of the behaviour analytic literature, then (I'm told), I'm expressing \" anti-ABA prejudices \". This is as absurd, as non-serious, as claiming that I have \"anti-cogntive-science prejudices\" and \"anti-cognitive-neuroscience prejudices\" because I have harshly criticized science and scientists in these areas of autism research (and continue to do so). The autism advocacy rejection of criticism and scrutiny as \"anti-ABA prejudice\"  places ABA outside the domain of science, which is dependent on criticism, and into the realm of ideology. Autism advocates demand that all decisions made about autistics conform to their ideology, which cannot be questioned or challenged in any way. They want the scientific and ethical standards that benefit and protect all non-autistics disregarded when it comes to legal and public policy decisions about autistics. This too is the opposite of taking autism seriously. Autism advocates have further trivialized autism by successfully promoting  grossly anti-scientific epidemiology  which has the effect of denying the existence of most autistics in Canada, and therefore denying most autistics in Canada even minimal services. This demonstrates how autism advocates write off all autistics who have not undergone unlimited \"medically necessary\" ABA/IBI starting very early in life. So does the widely disseminated autism advocacy position that autistics who do not receive unlimited \"medically necessary\" ABA/IBI starting early in life  need to be abused (kept in restraints, our teeth pulled) in institutions . Autism advocates have been successful in making Canadian society unsafe for any autistic who is not in an ABA program, but is this taking autism seriously? Autism advocates have also claimed to know with certainty the adult outcomes of autistics who undergo early ABA/IBI. There is no peer-reviewed science to justify this certainty. When there is no science whatsoever to support their positions, autism advocates respond by pretending that there is. Here again are the standards of science and ethics that autism advocates believe autistics deserve, but is this taking autism seriously?  The autism advocacy campaign to legally mandate ABA/IBI as \"medically necessary\" treatment for Rett's individuals also exemplifies the standards of science and ethics autism advocates find appropriate for autistics. This demonstrates exactly how seriously they take autism and the well-being of autistic people. Autism advocates also trivialize autism, and show off the scientific and ethical standards they are sure that autistics deserve, by creating and applying novel, untested diagnostic categories and criteria. They are so creative, they can diagnose adults and children, and describe our lives in detail, without having met us or knowing anything about us. They also claim that there are perfect predictors of outcome in autism. The purpose is to divide autism into the (apparently innate) categories of \"real\" and presumably \"fake\" autism. When I have time, I'll blog about the empirical bases and seriousness of this \"autism reality\". Autism advocates further trivialize autism by responding to any criticism of their actions and statements with  mockery, misrepresentation, and defamation . They consider themselves to be infallible. They are right about everything all the time. Their actions, which have consequences for all autistic Canadians at the level of law and public policy, are sacrosanct--anyone who criticizes them in any way is not only deluded, but reprehensible, pernicious, and dangerous (and in my case,  a fraud, imposter, and criminal ). This makes a productive, science- and ethics-based, respectful public discourse about autism impossible. The actions of autism advocates have unsurprisingly resulted in Canada's government and major opposition parties  agreeing that autistics shouldn't exist at all . Contrast the non-serious non-response of autism advocates to this political consensus that autistic lives should be prevented, with the careful and very serious actions and statements of the CDSS in response to recommendations re prenatal screening. You can see the CDSS in recent media stories  here ,  here  and  here . Autism is a disability. Here is a description of what disability means, from the Supreme Court of Canada decision in the Eldridge case: It is an unfortunate truth that the history of disabled persons in Canada is largely one of exclusion and marginalization. Persons with disabilities have too often been excluded from the labour force, denied access to opportunities for social interaction and advancement, subjected to invidious stereotyping and relegated to institutions [...]  This historical disadvantage has to a great extent been shaped and perpetuated by the notion that disability is an abnormality or flaw.  As a result, disabled persons have not generally been afforded the \u201cequal concern, respect and consideration\u201d that s. 15(1) of the Charter demands.  Instead, they have been subjected to paternalistic attitudes of pity and charity, and their entrance into the social mainstream has been conditional upon their emulation of ablebodied norms  [...] One consequence of these attitudes is the persistent social and economic disadvantage faced by the disabled.    [emphasis in blue is mine] This powerful and accurate definition of disability shows that autistic people are indeed severely disabled in Canadian society. We are at a tremendous disadavantage. This description of disability was central to my intervention in Auton at the Supreme Court of Canada, where I opposed autism advocates on both the parent side and the government side. In Auton, both sides consisted entirely of autism advocates, just as both sides, parents and governments, in the current supposed conflicts re ABA-based interventions are autism advocates. Neither side was or is now interested in providing autistics with genuine assistance so we can proceed safely and succeed in society; as I've written elsewhere, they agree entirely about what autistics are worth and how we should be treated. They are not interested in taking autism seriously. They are only haggling over whose unwanted burden we are.  The disability of autism is trivialized when it is claimed that when autistics are badly treated, harmed or neglected, the problem that has to be gotten rid of is autism (meaning, the existence of autistic people). This is a hallmark of autism advocacy: to insist that we need to be  abused and mutilated (kept in restraints, our teeth pulled) in institutions ; to deny that autistics are  sentient ,  existent, human or alive; to call us a blight on society ; to deny us even basic standards of science and ethics; then to flourish our resulting suffering and poor outcomes as evidence that autism is appalling and must be eradicated.

{"date": "Thursday, February 15, 2007", "body": "\nIn the House of Commons late last year, Liberal MP Blair Wilson  made this statement re autistic children and \"medically necessary\" ABA/IBI : For the child's humanity, treatment is necessary. Then he said: It is time Canada took action against autism, a blight on society. We must support this bill. To ensure that no one has any cause to wonder if this was really what Mr Wilson meant to say, Mr Wilson  highlighted this statement on his website--in large, bold letters : It is time Canada took action against autism, a blight on society. We must support this bill. \"This bill\" is  Prince Edward Island Liberal MP Shawn Murphy's private member's bill C-304 . This bill's main purpose is to alter the Canada Health Act to single out autism as a disease for which ABA/IBI is prescribed and mandated as \"medically necessary\" treatment. This bill has the effect of legislating physician-equivalent status for behaviour analysts, of legislating ABA/IBI as \"medically necessary\" for those diagnosed with Rett's, and of legislating all autistics as not only sick but \"suffering\". This will be the law. But back to Mr Wilson. According to Mr Wilson, autistics who have not had \"medically necessary\" ABA/IBI from very early in life--in order to stop us from blighting society--have no humanity. Most autistics in Canada have not had ABA/IBI from an early age, for many reasons, including that we are too old. We grew up before ABA/IBI was easily or at all available. There are very likely at least 150,000 autistics in Canada who have not had early and unlimited ABA/IBI. That number exceeds the entire population of Prince Edward Island, including Shawn Murphy. Mr Wilson has stated that a group of Canadians more numerous than all Prince Edward Islanders do not have humanity and are therefore not human. When I spoke with Mr Wilson's office, these statements of Mr Wilson's were vigorously defended. They are true, I was told, because FEAT says so. FEAT--Families for Early Autism Treatment--recently stated in the Globe and Mail that autistics who do not undergo unlimited \"medically necessary\" ABA/IBI starting early in life must be  institutionalized by the time we reach adolescence. We must live in restraints and have our teeth pulled . The ethicist Margaret Somerville--who was not aware of FEAT's prominent recommendations--has recently written in  the Globe and Mail , May we redesign disabled people to make them easier to care for? They used to take out all the teeth of mentally ill people so they couldn't bite their caregivers, but we are rightly appalled by that now.  But no one is appalled or even raises an eyebrow when it is recommended that most autistics in Canada (a population larger than that of Prince Edward Island, including Shawn Murphy) be abused this way. Certainly not Mr Wilson, who forcefully  supports and promotes FEAT. Mr Wilson has used his full power and influence to inform Canadians that most autistics in Canada are, unlike criminals and terrorists, not even human. We have no humanity. Those who are not human have no human rights. And those who have no human rights can be grossly abused with impunity. This is an experience shared by many of us. Other Liberal MPs have had additional ideas about how to write off autistic Canadians who they see as blighting the country. Ruby Dhalla has stated the Liberal Party of Canada position--a position  shared by the Conservative government and the NDP --that ideally there would be no autistic people at all in Canada. In order to  sensationally raise alarm about  a \"shocking\" autism \"epidemic\" , she has also rejected the broad scientific consensus that there has been a high, stable rate of autism. Instead, she insists that in 1996 and before, there were only 1 in 10,000 autistics. She and her office have repeatedly claimed that this figure, forcefully promoted by FEAT, is true, and further, that it comes from multiple expert researchers. Her \"expert\" autism epidemiology, a work of pure and absurd anti-scientific fiction, has the effect of eliminating the existence of more than 150,000 autistic Canadians--more than the entire population of Prince Edward Island, including Shawn Murphy. But Ms Dhalla does not care. She is sticking to her guns. She does not want most autistics in Canada to get any services at all, or even to be acknowledged. We don't exist--because she says so. The supposed \"debate\" about Shawn Murphy's bill C-304  resumed yesterday . In this \"debate\", Liberal MP Brian Murphy stated that autism is no less detrimental than the diagnosis of terminal cancer  and is therefore fatal if not treated. According to Brian Murphy, most autistic people in Canada are dead. We have not had the one \"medically necessary\" treatment he claims with  absolute certainty  is the only way to save us from our terminal disease. The above statements represent the major achievements of autism advocacy in Canada. Autistics have officially been declared diseased, a blight on society, subhuman, actually and ideally non-existent, and dead. The organizations and individuals applauded for representing us demand that we be institutionalized, be kept in restraints, and be permanently mutilated if we don't sufficiently become normal. Not one of our federal parties, not one Canadian MP or Senator, has expressed even a whisper of protest against any of this.  Canada is officially a country which hates autism, and therefore hates the existence of autistic people. No fact will be permitted to get in the way of this hideous and irrational hatred. No genuine debate about autism, no genuine assistance for autistic Canadians, can emerge from this gratuitous, dangerous and unopposed outpouring of denigration and dehumanization.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=2582666&Language=E&amp;Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1", "http://www.blairwilson.ca/upload/dir/speeches/Autism.pdf", "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070207.COASHLEY07/TPStory/Comment", "http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1&DocId=2700118#SOB-1905599"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2007/02/autism-blight-on-society.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 01, 2007", "body": "\nAutism again figures prominently in this month's APS Presidential Column by Morton Ann Gernsbacher,  \"On Not Being Human\"  (which I strongly recommend be read in its entirety). She asks,  Do we all agree that all humans are indeed, human?  And points out historical examples where the humanity of humans has been denied, including: The anonymous tract, Disputatio Nova Contra Mulieres, Qua Probatur Eas Homines Non Esse (A New Argument Against Women, in Which it Is Demonstrated That They Are not Human Beings), first published in 1595, was reprinted prolifically during the 17th and 18th centuries.  And: In the 1860s, British anthropologists espoused that Blacks were an inferior species, more comparable to apes than to Caucasians, and therefore well suited for slavery.  And: At the Nuremberg Trial, one SS general explained his allegiance to genocide by the simple contention that \u201cJews are not even human.\u201d Dr Gernsbacher then shows that assertions that some humans aren't human are not confined to the past. She supplies an example of a statement made by a language researcher at a conference not so many years ago: \u201cOh, I\u2019ve seen children with Williams syndrome. They don\u2019t count. They\u2019re not even human. They must belong to some other species entirely.\u201d  As Dr Gernsbacher points out, these spoken words did not make it into print. This contrasts with the situation in autism. Autistics have been prominently denied human status in accolade-laden books and in prominent peer-reviewed papers: For example, in a recent New York Times \u201cnotable book of the year,\u201d an internationally acclaimed psychological scientist segregated autistic people from other humans and placed them \u201ctogether with robots and chimpanzees.\u201d  Dr Gernsbacher has not named this acclaimed cognitive scientist, but he is instantly recognizable as Steven Pinker. She also provides this quote: \u201cit\u2019s as if they [autistic people] do not understand or are missing a core aspect of what it is to be human\u201d  Without peeking at the references, I have no trouble instantly attributing this one to  Bryna Siegel , who has been an expert witness for the government side in more than one Canadian ABA legal battle (e.g.,  Wynberg  and  Hewko ). Dr Gernsbacher goes on to explore of the work of Micheal Tomasello (again, not named, but unmistakable), who published two major target articles in the journal  Behavioral and Brain Sciences , in 1993 then in 2005. Dr Tomasello has authored many other articles as well as a highly praised and influential book, which have in common his contention that autistics, like apes, lack the essential features defining humans as human. Here is how Dr Gernsbacher describes the 2005 BBS article: In a more recent scholarly article, also written with the aim of delineating \u201cthe crucial difference between human cognition and that of other species,\u201d autistic people were again segregated from other humans and placed with great apes. After acknowledging that the empirical literature demonstrates that \u201cgreat apes and children with autism are clearly not blind to all aspects of intentional action,\u201d the authors raised the bar (\u201cunderstanding the intentional actions and perceptions of others is not by itself sufficient to produce humanlike social and cultural activities\u201d), and continued to pound home their belief that autistic children do not \u201cengage socially and culturally with others in the ways that human children do\u201d; they do not \u201cinteract with other persons in the species-typical manner.\u201d Their social behavior is just not human.  What Dr Gernsbacher does not point out is that the examples she provides are not exceptional. There is a list of famous scientists, currently prominent in various disciplines, who have in various ways denied that autistics are human ( or even alive ). In addition to Steven Pinker, Michael Tomasello, and Bryna Siegel, this list would include Peter Hobson, Fred Volkmar,  Thomas Insel ,  V.S. Ramachandran ,  Ivar Lovaas , and Paul Bloom.  Dr Gernsbacher concludes: Why are humans dehumanized? According to Morton Deutsch, this year\u2019s APS James McKeen Cattell award recipient, humans are dehumanized when they are perceived as a threat. What threat do humans with Williams syndrome and autistic humans pose to psychological scientists? A threat to the universality of the scientists\u2019 theories, a threat to the scientists\u2019 ability to accept human diversity? Last fall, a Duquesne University sophomore violated his Catholic university\u2019s code of conduct by posting on Facebook his opinion that homosexual behavior was \u201csubhuman.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t psychological scientists be held to an equally high code of conduct? In addition to being required to remove his offensive comment from the Web, the Duquesne sophomore had to write a 10-page essay on respect for human dignity. I wish some psychological scientists would at least read, if not write, a similar essay. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2124", "http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlight/2002/04/10-autism.htm", "http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025540.500-missing-persons.html", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/autism_and_personhood.html", "http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025540.500-missing-persons.html", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_vic.html#e"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2007/02/not-even-human.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 21, 2007", "body": "\nHere are some statements by the leading lights of autism advocacy in Canada. All these people are also prominent leaders of FEAT. Jean Lewis  (responding to the Auton Supreme Court of Canada decision): I've had parents call me about the possibility of refugee status to the United States. Can you believe it? Canadian refugees to the United States where they don't discriminate against disabled children Norrah Whitney  (testifying in the Senate): Federal laws such as these are what make the United States a remarkably better place for people with disabilities to live than Canada. In the U.S., equality in services, jobs and housing for people with autism and other disabilities is not optional. It is the law.  Andrew Kavchak : What is urgently needed now are three pieces of federal legislation \u2013 a Canadians with Disabilities Act, a Mental Health Parity Act and a Federal Individuals with Disability Education Act (IDEA). All these federal laws are what makes the United States a remarkably better place for people with disabilities to live than Canada. In the U.S., equality in services, jobs, housing, et cetera, for persons with autism and other disabilities is not optional -- it's the law. Sabrina Freeman , from an interview after the Auton SCC decision: There are no legal avenues left, she said, adding that parents have three choices: move to the United States, put children in the care of the government, or try to keep paying for the treatment on their own while trying to get federal legislation that is similar to that in the U.S.  The United States, said Freeman, has two \"extremely\" strong laws - the American Disabilities Act and the Individual Disability Education Act - to protect people with disabilities, she said.  \"We have nothing in Canada except for the Charter [of Rights and Freedoms]. We should be proud of our Charter, our Charter is fantastic,\" she said, \"but you know what? It's not worth the paper its written on.\"  Indeed, these are only a handful of the possible statements from Canada's elite autism advocates, all praising the US as a place where services, particularly ABA/IBI, are provided to autistics as a matter of course. Ms Lewis' \"refugee\" story appeared in the media around the world, informing everyone that the US is the place to be if you have an autistic child. And who would dare, who would have the temerity to disagree with these autism advocacy heavyweights?  Now it is again these and other pre-eminent Canadian autism advocates who have uncritically embraced then forcefully promoted the  Autism Speaks video, Autism Every Day .  The purpose of this video is to show the harsh realities of living with autism, and I think this  hard-hitting  video accomplishes this extremely well. I'll get back to this point a bit later. What is striking about this video is that all the autistic children are doing extremely badly, and all their parents are miserable and have appalling lives. This is according to the parents themselves. Their lives are hell. Their children are doomed. They must live in Canada, where according to our autism advocates, the services for autistic children are so grossly inadequate that Canadian parents are considering becoming refugees to the US, where the ABA/IBI services they demand are there for the taking. And as you can see, Canadian autism advocates are demanding sweeping changes to laws in Canada so that autism services are provided exactly like they are in the US. But back to Autism Every Day. It's Canadian, right? It must be, because our famous autism advocates support it to the hilt. But in reality, or in \"autism reality\", Autism Every Day is 100% American. Those doomed children and their suffering parents are all Americans. They live exactly where Canada's autism advocates want to live, so they can--they say--freely and easily get all the ABA/IBI services they want.  Because disagreeing with autism advocates is perilous (see Canada's notorious autism advocacy flagship website, commonly known as the \"hate site\"), we are required to assume that the American parents in Autism Every Day had free access to the services that autism advocates in Canada are demanding--that is, unlimited ABA/IBI.  Another glossy, hard-hitting Autism Speaks effort, an article in the  magazine Town and Country , helpfully shows that American children are getting ABA/IBI, sometimes in impressive amounts (e.g., 50hrs/wk), and of course this would be state-of-the-art ABA/IBI.  As a result, after 3 years of very intensive ABA, one autistic boy still cannot dress himself independently and is projected to require three more years of his 50hrs/wk ABA program to be able to signal \"bathroom\". His parents are miserable and devastated, and express their wish that their son would drown. Why? Because it would end his suffering, even though ABA/IBI is promoted as \"fun\" (strangely, in this Autism Speaks article, it's called \"grueling\"), and this boy is in ABA/IBI most of his waking hours. These parents, who profit from an optimal level of services, also claim that many other parents of autistic children feel just the same as they do, about wishing their child dead.  So Autism Every Day, and Autism Speaks in general (keeping in mind that they have now absorbed Cure Autism Now, as well as NAAR), is a testament to the failure of the services demanded by Canada's autism advocates.  And if Autism Every Day represents the true reality, the \"autism reality\", of living with autism, as our  powerful and influential autism advocates forcefully claim , then it is all the more a monument to the conspicuous failure and remarkable ineffectiveness of the services that these autism advocates are demanding.  Autism advocates in Canada have insisted very forcefully that ABA/IBI is an effective treatment for all autistics. Yet they promote Autism Every Day, in which the 100% failure of the easy availability of ABA/IBI to help either suffering autistic children or their miserable, suffering parents is dramatized to great effect. Autism Every Day is an excellent record of the harsh realities of autism, if you see it from the children's point of view. This is the very harsh reality of being an autistic child in a world where autism advocacy is not only prominent and predominant, but ubiquitous and the law.  This is the harsh reality of being written off as a very young child, of having your parents describe you as an appalling burden, of knowing that your parents are ashamed of you, of knowing that your mother wanted to kill you and refrained only because you have a non-autistic sister, of knowing that your parents want to make sure that children like you no longer exist, of  being shunted and talked around as if you are non-sentient props , and then being called unresponsive. When I watched Autism Every Day, my first thought was, what wonderful children. What great, totally cool, wonderful children. I watched it with the sound off. Those kids are marvellous. They can do so many things. They have courage out to there. They have lived through stuff that no child should have to live through, and they are still trying as hard as they can to communicate--to communicate with those who are widely disseminating the anti-scientific information that they can't learn or communicate at all.  Those kids are amazing. They are my heroes. They make sure I (and the people I work with) don't give up, working to  find the many things these kids are capable of doing , and finding  science- and ethics-based ways to help them succeed as autistic people , and opposing  all those who want them in institutions , and working to provide them with a world in which they are welcome, cherished, accommodated, celebrated, assisted, and understood.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1101000734496_81/?hub=Health", "http://www.parl.gc.ca/38/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/soci-e/05eva-e.htm?Language=E&Parl=38&Ses=1&comm_id=47", "http://www.oacrs.com/article.php?did=2005-2&aid=219", "http://www.langleyadvance.com/issues04/114104/news/114104nn1.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/21lifilm.html?_r=2&ref=nyregionspecial2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2006/07/town-country-is-just-trying-to-help.html", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2007/01/autism-every-day-realities-of-raising.html", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=105", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/nih-response/index.php"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2007/01/autism-every-days-harsh-realities.html", "title": "\n"},

Some serious rethinking is necessary, about intelligence in autism and possibly intelligence in general. Our data demonstrate that areas that have been presumed to be dysfunctional in autism (e.g., fluid intelligence, high-level abstract reasoning) are instead strengths. We have called into question the basis for dividing autism into presumed \"high\" and \"low\" functioning. This paper will probably be published in late 2007.

What follows is the description of this experiment from Ivar Lovaas' recent book (Lovaas, 2002): A pilot study done at the UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) Autism Clinic provides a particularly vivid example of apparent sensory deficits in children with autism. In an attempt to ascertain where a nervous system sensory \"block\" may be located, the chilren's heart rates, galvanic skin response, pupillary dilations and constrictions, and orientation to stimuli were recorded. Clapping one's hands directly behind a child's back and observing a failure to startle is often used as a diagnostic indicator of autism. We failed to observe a response to hand clapping even though the clapping was loud. Subsequently, and without prior warning, we increased the loudness and fired a very loud noise (from a starting pistol) 2 feet behind each child's back. This sound was of sufficient strength to elicit a major startle in attending adults. In contrast, little or no change was detected in any of the children's behaviors, despite the sensitivity of the measurement instruments employed. However, there were major alterations in all recordings when, instead of firing the loud starting pistol, the children heard the slight sound of a candy bar being unwrapped out of sight. It seemed as if the children would attend to their environment if there was a payoff for doing so. In evaluating the outcome of this experiment, it is important to be reminded of the large differences among persons with autism. In regard to the experiment with the starting pistol, a child with a fear of unusual sounds, such as those from vacuum cleaners or ambulance sirens, may well have reacted differently from those children we observed in the study.

{"date": "Sunday, January 07, 2007", "body": "\nAccording to Canada's eminent autism advocates, anyone who criticizes ABA-based autism interventions is, to put it more politely than they do, ignorant, misguided and reprehensible (you can see this on their flagship website, which I respond to  here ; see also  here ). It looks like I'm going to overlook this forcefully-promoted pillar of autism advocacy--that ABA is above science, ethics, and scrutiny--again. Harold Doherty, an influential and powerful Canadian autism advocate, has helpfully supplied what he sees as definitive evidence that  ABA-based interventions are \"Most Effective In Educating Autistic Children\" . This is interesting, because Mr Doherty also supports the view that ABA-based autism interventions are not education at all, but are \"medically necessary\" treatment. In fact, right now, we have one set of autism advocates heavily lobbying Parliamentarians (Senators and MPs) to alter the law and mandate ABA-based autism interventions as \"medically necessary\" for all autistics in Canada. And we have another set of autism advocates going to the Supreme Court of Canada, just down the street, to deny that ABA-based autism interventions are medical treatment or \"medically necessary\" treatment or medical in any way at all.  Those are the autism advocates who support the Wynberg trial decision.   But back to Mr Doherty's science.  Mr Doherty supplies three sources to support the effectiveness of ABA as education for autistic children. One is the MADSEC report. One is a list of papers or reports, and short descriptions of same, provided on Dr Lovaas' website (the Lovaas Institute, you can see this page  here ; Mr Doherty has copied parts of this into his post). The last is the Auton trial decision. The MADSEC report bases its conclusions on a total of three ABA controlled trials, Lovaas (1987; and follow-up, McEachin et al., 1993), Birnbrauer and Leach (1993), and Sheinkopf and Siegel (1998). The first two are prospective, while the last is retrospective. Lovaas (1987) and follow-up are dependent on the use of aversives, and therefore represent a treatment which is no longer acceptable. Birnbrauer and Leach have presented a 10-year follow-up, showing that the few children who did well in their study (four of them, none of whom achieved \"normal functioning\") did not maintain these gains on follow-up (Birnbrauer and Leach, 2006). Sheinkopf and Siegel (1998), the retrospective study, features no autistics who achieved \"normal functioning\", and also shows no correlation between intensity of treatment and outcome measures. Lovaas (2002) forcefully criticizes this study, and does not accept its validity. Then there is the list from Dr Lovaas' website, or the parts of it reproduced by Mr Doherty on his blog. First there is this claim, Between 1985 and 2005, there were over 500 articles published concerning Applied Behavior Analysis and autism. I don't dispute this at all. I've read quite a few of these articles. Dr Lovaas does not make any claims as to what these articles have found or their quality. Arguing that quantity of articles is evidence of treatment effectiveness is akin to arguing that the ToM, EF, and/or WCC accounts of autism must be correct because there are hundreds of articles about these theories, or that social skills training must be effective because there is an impressive number of articles about this kind of intervention. Here's the rest of the list Mr Doherty provides from Dr Lovaas' website: Lovaas (1987):  In multiple post-1987 papers (e.g., Smith & Lovaas, 1998), and in the book Dr Lovaas recommends (Lovaas, 2002), Lovaas and colleagues have underlined the problem of the 10 non-normal-functioning children profiting little from ABA. E.g., their IQs did not increase at all, even though some stayed in their ABA programs for 10 years. Lovaas (2002) has stated that these children must stay in ABA programs for life. There is also the essential role of physical punishment (contingent aversives) in this study, which you can read about  here, complete with quotes from Lovaas (1987).  A Rett's girl was in Control Group 1, which was not reported until Boyd (1998). The savant abilities of at least one of the experimental group children were extinguished (Epstein et al., 1985; I wrote about this  here ). Also of interest to Mr Doherty (who has weighed in about high and low functioning in autism, as well as about savant syndrome), five of the autistic children in Control Group 1 (a group which had poor outcomes) were high-functioning. Mr Doherty is a leading autism advocate, so I will assume he knows where that fact is reported.  McEachin, Smith & Lovaas (1993):  the follow-up into school ages of Lovaas (1987): See above. One of the \"normal functioning\" children loses this status. Jacobson et al. (1998):  This paper lacks a factual foundation, because in 46 years of behaviour analytic research in autism, there is no peer-reviewed paper which reports data about the adult outcomes of children who received 3 years of ABA-based intervention between the ages of 2-6. There is no controlled trial of a non-aversive early ABA/IBI that has a published follow-up into school ages (the one presented follow-up presented a failure; Birnbrauer & Leach, 2006). Also, Canada's autism advocates have rejected this level of service (3 years of ABA) as unacceptable, and Dr Lovaas claims that children who do not achieve \"normal functioning\" by age 7 must stay in ABA programs for their entire lives (Lovaas, 2002).   The NYSDOH report:  This report found only four studies (of the 232 looked at) of ABA-based early intensive interventions that met their standards: Lovaas (1987) together with McEachin et al. (1993); Birnbrauer and Leach (1993); Smith et al. (1997); and Sheinkopf and Siegel (1998). All these papers have been described above except Smith et al. (1997), a retrospective study (not a true experimental design) showing very limited results (increase in IQ of 8 points, almost half of which is accounted for by one participant; no \"normal functioning\").  The Surgeon General's report:  The only ABA-based study cited is Lovaas (1987) together with McEachin et al. (1993).  Eikeseth et al. (2002):  A ME-Book (Lovaas, 1981) based ABA program is compared to a an unknown intensity of ABA plus a lot of contradictory approaches (this is called \"eclectic\" treatment). The groups are unmatched, and finish with no significant differences, even though the experimental group had greater gains. The study is for one year only. None of the children achieve \"normal functioning\". Howard et al. (2005):  This is also a one-year study that compares an ABA-based intensive intervention (for which there is no manual), to \"eclectic\" treatment (ABA of unknown quantity or quality, plus contradictory approaches), as well as to generic segregated special education. The groups aren't matched. None of the children achieve \"normal functioning\". The reported \"effectiveness\" of the ABA-based treatment does not take into account the total failure of two children, who could not continue in ABA, and whose data were discarded. Sallows & Graupner (2005):  The 48% rate of \"rapid learners\" can only be achieved by combining the control group with the experimental group, producing an uncontrolled trial. The control group performed better than the experimental group. This was not a feature of Lovaas (1987). This paper shows that neither intensity nor quality of ABA-based interventions is relevant to outcomes. Cohen et al. (2006, see below) point out that this study does not have a comparison group. Also, Sallows & Graupner (2005) report using a wide variety of approaches apart from Lovaas ABA, including non-behaviour analytic approaches. And finally,  Cohen et al. (2006):  The limited number of significant differences between outcome measures in the unmatched groups vanishes when non-matched variables are accounted for, with the one exception of classroom placement. Kasari (2006) has pointed out that classroom placement is a measure of parent pressure, rather than of child achievement. The control condition is segregated special education, of less intensity (less hrs/wk) than the ABA treatment. Mr Doherty's last source is the Auton trial judge, and the Auton trial decision. This is his evidence that randomized assignment, a standard used to protect and benefit all non-autistics, should not apply to autistics. Mr Doherty further adds that there are ethical implications to randomized assignment. This is on the assumption that Lovaas-type ABA is known to be effective and therefore, you cannot deprive any autistics of this treatment. So let's sum up Mr Doherty's science. The evidence from the MADSEC report (which did not have to pass peer review) amounts to very little in the absence of an aversive-based study. Only Sheinkopf & Siegel (1998) is left, a retrospective study that Lovaas (2002) strongly objects to. Mr Doherty may be arguing that autistics don't need controlled trials either.  The list of studies and reports from Dr Lovaas' site is selective, and the selected studies are selectively reported. Dr Lovaas does not include all the ABA controlled trials, and he includes only one uncontrolled trial. Sheer number of studies (without reference to their quality, content, relevance, etc.) is not evidence of effectiveness. Using the website of an organization which provides a particular treatment as evidence for the effectiveness of that treatment represents the kind of low standards that autism advocates demand for autistics. Finally, Mr Doherty uses the Auton trial decision to deny the importance of randomization. This assumes that this decision is scientifically accurate, and is based on peer-reviewed science. That is demonstrably not the case (e.g., see the description of the 1 in 64 study, which was not even in evidence). However, let's accept this for now and look at the evidence in Auton. There were only two controlled trials of ABA-based interventions in the evidence in Auton (in fact, these were the only primary sources reporting data about ABA-based interventions). These would necessarily be the studies being referred to by the trial judge re the importance of randomized assignment. One of them (Lovaas, 1987, and follow-up) is dependent on aversives, and represents a treatment that is currently unacceptable. The other (Smith et al., 1997) is not a true experimental design. It is retrospective, and, as reported above, has weak results which did not support the claims made by the Auton parents. These two studies are insufficient to argue that failing to enroll all autistics in non-aversive ABA programs (on the grounds that their effectiveness has been proven) is unethical.  ABA/IBI does have one existing randomized controlled trial (Smith, Groen & Wynn, 2000, 2001). This is left off Dr Lovaas' page, even though it was conducted at UCLA by behaviour analysts he trained and oversaw, and is of greater importance than Lovaas (1987). Smith, Groen & Wynn (2000, 2001) represents both the scientifc standards that would apply to Mr Doherty and all non-autistics (a randomized controlled trial), and the outcome of a treatment that is not, unlike the treatment reported in Lovaas (1987), dependent on contingent aversives.  A description and criticism of Smith, Groen & Wynn (also, accurate information about the NYSDOH report, and about the importance of randomized assignment) can be found  here . I'll add that the reported increase in IQ is confined to the PDD-NOS group. Also, there is a second erratum (Dr Gernsbacher describes one of the published errata, which eliminates the reported result in language) published by the authors to correct another important error in the text (re educational placement). There is also the Canadian study, Eaves and Ho (2004), which shows no effect of kind or amount of any currently marketed autism treatment in the \"critical\" 2-5 yr range. About half the children in this study were in ABA programs, and their outcomes did not differ from the children who were not in ABA programs. I can also suggest comparing the standards, quality, etc., of the reports and sources favoured by Mr Doherty (MADSEC report, Dr Lovaas' website, the Auton trial decision) with the sources which have concluded that when it comes to autism interventions, we do not have sufficient information to decide what is effective for all autistic individuals (e.g., NRC, 2001; Volkmar et al., 2004). The NRC also alluded to the absence of basic ethical considerations in the entire body of autism intervention research. I agree with Mr Doherty that there has been and no doubt will continue to be a lot of incompetent, non-valid and self-interested criticism of ABA-based interventions, including from behaviour analysts. Indeed, this poverty of criticism is why I wrote  The Misbehaviour of Behaviourists , almost three years ago, and also in part why I wrote a series here about aversives. Putting sourced and referenced accurate information on the record is important, so that sweeping statements (e.g., about criticisms of ABA) by influential and powerful leaders like Mr Doherty can be verified against the public record. The record shows that I've been as harsh a critic of incompetent criticisms of ABA-based interventions as any behaviour analyst. This does not mean that accurate criticism of these interventions is non-existent, unnecessary, reprehensible, or impossible. There is also the problem of ethics, a more important issue than the \"effectiveness\" issue, which is written about above. It is more important because an apparently effective treatment may be unethical. This has been shown in the area of ABA-based interventions, by the strong and decisive ethical objections, including from behaviour analysts, to Dr Lovaas' other NIH-funded early ABA/IBI--which was also demanded by parents and said to be the only effective treatment for the targeted pathology. My attempt to  \"point out that ethical standards which have improved the circumstances of all other persons would equally benefit autistics, and would also improve the state of the science\" , has been met with extreme opposition (including defamation) by autism advocates.  The above does not represent anything more than a brief response to some aspects of Mr Doherty's post. I haven't touched on major issues in the behaviour analytic literature, like diagnostic standards, accounting (or not) for medication, etc. I've only provided tiny, superficial descriptions of studies and reports, though what I wrote can be verified, and they're all studies and reports that I know well (I don't know exactly which 500 studies Dr Lovaas is referring to, but I've probably read a lot of them). I haven't gone into the existence of a successful controlled trial of a non-ABA-based intervention, reported in a peer-reviewed journal. Etc. And I've barely mentioned ethical consideration, which is paramount. I've failed to suggest that Mr Doherty provide sources for the kinds of criticism he considers should not be made. I've forgotten to point out the dramatic contrast between the huge amount of existing autism research and the concurrent poverty of knowledge about autism and about how to help autistic people--a contrast which might have something to do with the effectiveness of autism advocacy. And later, I'll try to post an outline of some of the major bases on which ABA-based interventions can and should be criticized.  The onus is on autism advocates like Mr Doherty to show how discarding basic scientific and ethical standards, the standards which protect and benefit themselves, helps autistics. My own suggestion is that  lousy scientific and ethical standards  are  bad for everyone , including those who, like autism advocates, demand that they be imposed on autistics. (If this post looks like it was written in pieces by a person busy doing other things, that's because it was; some of the information above has already been provided on this blog, see e.g.,  here  and  here  , as well as on my website, but autism advocacy involves repeating the same things over and over, which means responding can be tedious).

{"date": "Tuesday, January 02, 2007", "body": "\nLast November, New Scientist published a short article called  Ear implant success sparks culture war . This is from the opening paragraph: A spate of new studies has shown that profoundly deaf babies who receive cochlear implants in their first year of life develop language and speech skills remarkably close to those of hearing children. Many of the children even learn to sing passably well and function almost flawlessly in the hearing world. This is regardless that, as the New Scientist points out eventually, Even the most technically advanced implant provides the brain with only an extremely coarse approximation of the signal provided by a healthy ear. These findings are important, because surgical implantation in the second or third years of life, as was more usually done, has not been so successful: Until recently there was no good evidence that implants routinely improved children's chances of developing normal speech and language, raising fears that those fitted with implants would be stuck in a no-man's land - part of neither the hearing world nor the deaf one. Earlier this year,  through a landmark legal decision , sign language became a  de facto  official language in Canada. But in the New Scientist article, \"normal\" language is defined as excluding sign language, which is like excluding any other language (e.g., French, Cree) from being \"normal\" language. The article goes on to say: That concern may be put to rest by the new studies. In one, presented last week at the Bionic Ear Institute in Melbourne, Australia, a team led by Richard Dowell at the University of Melbourne showed that 11 profoundly deaf children who received cochlear implants before the age of 1 had entirely normal language development at least up to age 4 to 5. Language skills were assessed using a battery of tests, including routine tests of comprehension and expression and observing at what age they started different types of babbling and using key words. Their language development was also superior to a further 36 children who had been implanted at age 1 or 2, suggesting that the earlier the implant is fitted the better. \"The kids still don't have normal hearing, but they have normal language. They can have a conversation, make a joke, lie, tease - all those normal things that 4 or 5-year-olds do,\" says team member Shani Dettman. Again, \"normal\" language is defined as excluding sign language. Then there is the implication that native signing deaf children can't have conversations, make jokes, etc. Only children who have \"normal\" language (meaning, not sign language) can do these things. The New Scientist goes on to quote a researcher, Ann Geers, who was involved in another study reporting the effectiveness of very early implantation: Geers agrees deaf culture may be under threat, but says \"there is no hostility here. People are doing this so that deaf people can live in the hearing world, marry who they like, and work where they like, and so that hearing parents can have their children as part of their culture. But it must seem like genocide to the deaf.\" Now deaf people who remain deaf are not only considered to lack \"normal\" language, their basic human rights have vanished. They can no longer marry who they like or work where they like. That is, they lack some of the very basic human rights that benefit and protect non-deaf people and which non-deaf people can take for granted. \"Hostility\" is beside the point. Setting aside arguments about culture, this is a demonstration of how human rights disappear. A group of people has their essential human differences pathologized. Their basic human qualities are then denied--because their differences have become unacceptable. A treatment is then promoted that promises to eradicate their pathology and make them normal, or at least make them appear to be as normal as possible.  When a human difference is classified as a pathology and then declared treatable, those having this difference--in this case, deaf people--no longer have rights as themselves.   This is how the human rights of homosexuals would have disappeared if Ivar Lovaas' NIH-funded Feminine Boy Project had not been challenged as to its ethics--versus its effectiveness--by behaviour analysts and others (some information about the UCLA FBP is  here  and  here ).  According to Canada's autism advocates, criticizing ABA programs is reprehensible. But if no one had criticized the apparently \"effective\" FBP, the world would look very different right now. As I've written elsewhere, we would not have recently had a political debate resulting in the acceptance of same-sex marriage in Canada. We would instead have desperate parents using the  Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms --our highest law--to demand that governments fund \"medically necessary\" Lovaas homosexuality treatment. We would have all our national political parties, including our federal government, supporting \"homosexuality advocates\" in their demands for a \"National Homosexuality Strategy\" with an emphasis on surveillance, early diagnosis and treatment of this treatable--provided treatment starts early enough, and is sufficiently intensive--pathology.

{"date": "Sunday, December 24, 2006", "body": "\nPeter Szatmari is the best known and most influential of Canada's autism researchers. His published papers are always worth reading, regardless of whether you agree or disagree with his general direction. I'm bending the rules of Verbatim slightly and quoting from Dr Szatmari's 2004 book, which is a popular rather than scholarly book. It is, however, his only published book to date, and while Dr Szatmari is not a cognitive scientist, here he is musing about autistic cognitive processes. These are two excerpts from the same chapter. They are deliberately chosen to circumvent, as much as is possible in this book, Dr Szatmari's preponderant and constant reminders that, in his view, the autistic abilities he exclaims about are only the pathological side-effects of our overwhelming and devastating impairments. Justin is a 30 year old autistic adult, one of the first autistics Dr Szatmari ever met. Justin is especially fascinated with thunderstorms. Every time there is a thunderstorm he takes his tape machine outside and records the sounds. Afterward he plays the tapes to amuse himself and to help him fall asleep. He also likes to buy commercially produced weather tapes and will add them to his collection of homemade tapes. Once, after he bought a couple of tapes, he quickly noticed the same thunderstorm was on both of them. He was not a little put out at the discovery. \"How dare they try to pull a fast one on me?\" he said indignantly. I once asked him why he recorded thunderstorms. \"They all sound the same, don't they?\" Justin looked at me as if I were the stupidest person on earth. \"No,\" he said. \"They all sound quite different.\" But he did not elaborate. I asked him to bring some tapes to our next appointment, and we spent the hour listening to them. He was right; all storms do sound different. He pointed out the variation in the peals of thunder. There were differences in volume, of course, but I had never heard the wide range of pitch and rhythm. How amazing! [...] It is the ability to see, hear, and play with the intimate architecture of the world that is truly amazing. The rest of us can see this architecture too if we make a conscious decision to look. But we are rarely drawn to it as a natural affinity. We have to work at it. We have to turn away from language and from social relationships to see it. People with autism gravitate to it effortlessly. Reference: Szatmari, P. (2004).  A mind apart: Understanding children with autism and Asperger syndrome.

{"date": "Thursday, December 21, 2006", "body": "\n As I pointed out here a bit earlier , the Canadian Senate Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology made this statement in a report they issued in 2005: In future, we hope to have the opportunity to undertake a thematic study on autism. Meanwhile, we advocate a fuller debate among all stakeholders. In particular, the Committee believes that persons living with autism must be recognized as full and equal partners in the discussion. That \"thematic study on autism\" has now taken place in a series of hearings, with a report due in May, 2007. I tried to ask for two things in these hearings, and indeed, some themes emerged.  Previous hearings were used by autism advocates as a platform from which to denigrate and dehumanize autistics (see  this  and  this ). I asked the Senators to apply at least minimal standards to their autism hearings, so that autistics would not again be dehumanized and therefore harmed.  This was totally rejected. I was told that all views of autistic people were welcome, no matter how dehumanizing. There was no indication that this Committee saw dehumanization as being harmful to autistics. Perhaps they had already decided that if autistics are dehumanized, this is because we are in fact less than human. In any case, even a superficial glance through the transcripts in the Senate autism hearings shows that living, healthy, present autistics have been described, without protest, as bleeding to death, kidnapped, and dead. Autistics have been repeatedly portrayed as just naturally being violent because we're autistic, as appalling burdens, etc. Unsurprisingly, in the final hearing on December 8 (a hearing supposedly dedicated to autism research), one Senator asked a non-autistic witness about the problem (which made this Senator \"sadder than I already have been\") that autistics (\"those who suffer from this disability\") don't feel anything. We don't experience happiness or pain. This was a Senator asking a non-autistic about an assumption the Senator had made--that autistics aren't sentient, or human. The second thing I asked was for the Senators to live up to what they wrote in 2005, and to include autistics in these hearings as \"full and equal partners\".  Instead, the Senators banned autistics  from the most important hearing of the series, the big round table meeting about autism research. I spent some time trying to persuade the Senators that they should reconsider. This also was totally rejected.  Their decision to ban autistics from discussions and decisions about autism research, like their decision that the dehumanization of autistics is welcome, is a major consequence of these hearings. Autistics have been banned before. Efforts were made to change this. Now the Senate has weighed in and showed all Canadians that autistics really should be banned. And if we're dehumanized too, that's also just fine. That's how autistics should be treated in Canada.  Canada's Senators have told autistics to stay away from autism research, to forget about even considering that we have anything to say about our future (a future which is overwhelmingly determined by autism research), and to leave the major decisions about us in the hands of non-autistics. They've told autistics we should never, ever question this.  And the Senators refuse to explain why autistics were banned. Senator Art Eggleton's office promised to send a letter with an explanation. This promise was no less empty than the Senators' promise to recognize autistics as \"full and equal partners\".  According to Senator Eggleton, speaking at the autistic-free round table about autism research, the Senators asked R\u00e9mi Quirion from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to decide who should attend this meeting. The CIHR, and Dr Quirion himself, have previously united with Autism Society Canada, Autism Speaks (NAAR, at the time), the Canadian Autism Intervention Research Network and others,   to ban autistics from all discussions and decisions about autism research in Canada .  Dr Quirion and the CIHR, and ASC, Autism Speaks and CAIRN, have never apologized for this, or indicated that they may have made an error, or explained why they decided to ban autistics. Instead, they continue to maintain that while autistics deserve to be banned, we don't deserve an explanation. Canada's Senators have just repeated the same process and made the same decisions, with all their considerable authority: autistics should be banned, and we aren't worth the bother of an explanation.  Meanwhile, non-autistic parents are as always invited, always considered expert, always welcome, and always taken very seriously. It would be unthinkable to ban non-autistic parents. This would make headlines. There would be demonstrations. There would be outraged editorials. Same thing if non-autistic parents were dehumanized, or portrayed as just naturally being violent, as autistics have been in these hearings. Heads would roll. You would never hear the end of it. Etc.  At the December 8 meeting, Senator Eggleton, the Committee Chairperson, indicated sternly that the Senators had invited quite enough autistics already. Clearly, having us at the round table with the 16 invited non-autistics (parents, parent-run organizations, family members, and researchers) would have been downright excessive, and surely outlandish, by the standards of our Senators.  Of the 48 witnesses who appeared in the Senate autism hearings, 5 were autistics (most hand-picked by organizations overwhelmingly run by and for non-autistics), and 43 were non-autistics.  Of the 12 sessions, non-autistics appeared in 10, and autistics appeared in 2. Non-autistic parents and/or parent-run groups (16 witnesses) appeared in 7 sessions. None of the many groups which appeared had any meaningful participation by autistics, and most had none at all. Groups that actively ban autistics, including by denying that autistics who communicate are autistic, were welcomed with open arms (e.g., Autism Speaks, the CIHR, CAIRN, FEAT), as was ASC, which has recently banned autistics, and having been required to appear to include autistics, has built a supervised autistic ghetto.  Of the 48 witnesses, ASC had at least 8 witnesses, CAIRN had at least 6 witnesses, FEAT had at least 4, and Autism Speaks had at least 2. The CIHR appreared, as did the Office for Disability Issues and Health Canada--all government organizations that have banned autistics, and of course, the CIHR was welcomed by the Senate to help the Senate ban us again. I'm afraid I (outlandishly) suggested that groups that ban autistics--or, like ASC,  confine autistics to a small, supervised hand-picked powerless ghetto --should no more be given a platform by the Senate than would groups that ban Jews or black people or people in wheelchairs (or confine these groups to a small, supervised hand-picked powerless ghetto) while claiming to represent them, but of course this was rejected before I was even done saying it. Banning autistics is fine with this Senate Committee. They did it themselves. As happened in the previous set of hearings, I was not permitted to testify under my affiliation, and was required to appear as an individual. That is, the Senate refused to recognize that an autistic is a research associate affiliated with a research group, even though all correspondence was signed with my affiliation, and I requested to appear under my affiliation (and was also recommended as a witness by the research group I'm affiliated with). Since all the non-autistics who testified were permitted to use their affiliations (even when identifying themselves as parents or family members), I have to conclude that the persistent refusal of the Senators to recognized my affiliation is related to my diagnosis, and to the prejudices these Senators are promoting in their \"thematic study on autism\", including that autistics should not in any way be considered as equals, and that we have nothing to contribute to autism research.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.isn.net/~jypsy/AuSpin/senate05.htm", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_sen.html", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_pp.html", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_one.html"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/12/senates-thematic-study-on-autism.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, December 23, 2006", "body": "\nThere have been  a few posts lately about self-diagnosis . Earlier this year, the issue of diagnosis  became the subject of a petition, when demands that are never made of non-autistics were made of autistics . I'm a big fan of autistics getting formally diagnosed, but I have trouble with double standards. I posted  a comment about this over on the TMoB board . I'm going to repeat a part of it here, to show another aspect of this issue that is usually overlooked. Sometimes, an autistic adult who doesn't have formal a diagnosis is not considered suspect in any way and is perfectly uncontroversial. The autism advocate featured in the excerpt below, David Vardy, was until recently Autism Society Canada's 1st Vice President, and continues to be a Director of ASC's Newfoundland affiliate. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I also wonder why parents aren't questioned, when they fail to get a prompt diagnosis for their autistic child. A classic example is  in the well-known \"autism is worse than cancer\" Senate testimony from then-ASC 1st Vice President David Vardy . At the time he testified, Mr Vardy's autistic son Adam was 31 years old. This means he was born in 1972, which is 11 years after I was born. The gist of Mr Vardy's testimony is that having an autistic son is horrible, and has destroyed his and his family's life. And of course he testified that it would be better if autism were fatal. According to his testimony, Mr Vardy didn't notice much different about his autistic son at all, until he was 15. Then, he testifies (this would have happened in 1987, seven years after autism first appeared in the DSM, and the year the DSMIII-R came out),  We had no choice but to have him taken to a hospital, where he was admitted and diagnosed incorrectly with bipolar disorder. That was because our medical system did not have the capacity to diagnose autism at the time. It is not much better today. Mr Vardy goes on to recount multiple wrong diagnoses, and adds, Medical practitioners regarded Adam as a puzzle. Psychiatrists did not consider autism to be a possible diagnosis. Then Mr Vardy diagnoses his own son: Up to this point in time, we had not received a concrete diagnosis for Adam. After his hospitalization, it was suggested by an adolescent counsellor that a mild variety of autism could be the problem. We investigated the literature in this area. We read the medical journals, and we came to the conclusion that autism was the problem. The psychiatrist at the time did not concur with this. And: Other professionals, such as a speech language pathologist, did [concur that Adam was autistic]. We reached a point where Adam became so reluctant to see doctors that we never did get a formal diagnosis. So Mr Vardy's son Adam is an undiagnosed autistic. Neither an adolescent counsellor nor an SLP is qualified to diagnose autism.  Yet Mr Vardy was 1st Vice President of ASC, and was considered an autism expert by the Canadian Senate. Not only did he not prove his son was autistic, he could not do this.  Oddly, there was no outcry from the powerful and influential leaders of the Canadian \"autism community\".  You can imagine what would happen if this story was told from Adam Vardy's point of view, not David Vardy's. Adam becomes \"self-diagnosed\", there is certainty that he is an imposter and fraud (and surely a malingerer) because his parents did not notice anything when he was young, professionals never considered or actually denied that he was autistic, etc. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/12/on-validity-of-self-diagnoses.html", "http://www.autistics.org/library/whoisautistic.html", "http://www.quicktopic.com/27/H/vJvhV4fDnBgw7/m4600", "http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/2/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/soci-e/09ev-e.htm?Language=E&Parl=37&Ses=2&comm_id=47"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/12/when-not-being-diagnosed-is-just-fine.html", "title": "\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, December 05, 2006", "body": "\n Liberal MP Andy Scott's motion to create a national autism strategy  was passed in the House of Commons today. All national political parties supported this motion, a reflection of their explicitly stated shared  goal and ideal of a Canada free of autistic people . Mr Scott's motion, drafted in consultation with Canada's important autism advocates, can be found in his  press release announcing the passing of this motion This is what I wrote about the consequences of Mr Scott's motion  on the TMoB board , many hours before it passed: [A]utistics in Canada will be more and more seen and treated as though we are sick, defective, diseased and unwanted burdens who have nothing to contribute to Canada except the possibility that we may one day (after undergoing unlimited medical and other interventions) imitate the people who say we have so little worth that we shouldn't even exist.  Starting tomorrow, we'll be more and more likely to be required to undergo unlimited treatment to get rid of our essential traits and abilities. We'll be less and less likely to receive assistance and accommodation to allow these traits and abilities to flourish. We'll be less and less likely to have basic human rights to protect our essential differences. Interestingly, both  the autism advocate Harold Doherty  and  Liberal MP and autism advocate Shawn Murphy  consider that this motion is about autistic children only, though the exclusiveness of the motion to children who Mr Murphy considers to be \"suffering from Autism Spectrum Disorder\" is not specified in the motion itself. The debates in the House of Commons prior to the passing of Mr Scott's motion also revealed that our political leaders see all autistic people who now exist in Canada as being children. In fact, Peter Stoffer, the NDP MP who seconded Mr Scott's motion, invariably describes autistics as children, which is like referring to all aboriginal people in Canada as children.  However, Mr Scott's motion does not go nearly as far as autism advocates wish, or as far as Mr Scott ( who sees all autistics as sick and requiring medical treatment ) wishes. Also, this is merely a motion against autism, and our autism advocates demand a law against autism. This time,  Mr Murphy is leading the charge , to pathologize all autistic traits and abilities under the law, and to have one approach to autism--that would be ABA/IBI--legislated as \"medically necessary\" treatment for all autistic people in Canada (keeping in mind that Mr Murphy seems to consider all autistic people to be children). Mr Murphy wrote in his  recent press release : Research shows that children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, which affects two in every thousand Canadian children, can grow up to function independently in society when they receive Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) and Intensive Behavioral Intervention (IBI) from an early age through to adulthood.  In fact, research shows that Mr Murphy's epidemiology is out to lunch, and therefore consistent with the standards of all our famous autism advocates.  But I want to see the peer-reviewed research Mr Murphy refers to, which apparently gives data from a controlled trial about the adult outcomes of children who underwent early ABA/IBI, and shows that these adults \"function independently\" (whatever that means; independently of what?). In fact, Mr Murphy is reporting research on autistics who start ABA/IBI at the age of early diagnosis and stay in it \"through to adulthood\", and \"function independently\" (starting at what age?). I'd like to see those controlled trials as reported in peer-reviewed papers. I'd write to him and ask for the references, but he hasn't answered even one of a handful of much easier questions I sent him a long time ago. Questions like whether his proposed law would make ABA/IBI \"medically necessary\" for Rett's individuals, or who should be involved in making decisions about autistic people, or which kind(s) of ABA/IBI he wants the law to make \"medically necessary\", or whether ABA-based interventions would only be considered medical treatment when applied to autistics but not to those with other neurodevelopmental disabilities, or whether behaviour analysts would now be considered medical professionals, etc. I was told by his staff that these questions were too difficult. They shouldn't be, not for an expert like Mr Murphy, who took one look at a photo of an autistic person and declared that this person, Alex Bain, looked \"normal\" (Mr Murphy's instant diagnosis). This made Mr Murphy decide that this autistic's mother--janet norman-bain--was ignorant of autism. In true autism advocate style, Mr Murphy thought it necessary to repeatedly inform Ms norman-bain that autism is a spectrum, something he assumed she was not aware of. At least we now know that Mr Murphy is an expert in condescension. He could give lessons. In any case, I'd sure like to see all that research showing that ABA-based autism interventions are medical in nature and therefore constitute medical treatment. Where is this research, Mr Murphy and Mr Scott? All I see everywhere in peer-reviewed behaviour analytic journals is ABA-based interventions being described as education, as a learning approach, as instruction, as training. And I don't see ABA-based intervention studies being published in medical journals, with medical journal standards (e.g., disclosing conflicts of interest). I also see famous behaviour analysts denying that medical approaches to autism are valid, and emphasizing the effectiveness--by their standards--of non-medical approaches (Lovaas, 1979; Lovaas and Smith, 1988, 1989; Lovaas, 1993; Lovaas, 2002; etc.). But anyone who's familiar with autism advocacy knows that autism advocates believe that autistics don't deserve even the most basic standards of science, ethics, and advocacy, much less the high standards that benefit and protect themselves. After all, their ideal Canada is not one in which autistics participate as equals, but  one in which autism is prevented and therefore autistics do not exist at all . In the meantime, we have a motion against autism, and a law can't be far behind. References: Lovaas, O.I. (1979).

{"date": "Thursday, November 30, 2006", "body": "\nCanada's Health Minister, Tony Clement, recently made some announcements about the future of autistics in Canada. One thing he announced was a new page about autism on the Health Canada website. The location of this page reflects the Conservative government's position  that autism is a disease . In Canada, autistics are therefore seen as sick and as needing treatment in order to become healthy, meaning non-autistic. The  Health Canada page  elaborates on this government's position, a position now being imposed as public policy: Despite the frequency of ASD, there is much that is unknown about these disorders. More research is needed to better understand the incidence, causes, effective early screening tools, optimal treatments, and hopefully one day, prevention. Canada's government has taken the position that autistics have nothing to contribute to society, have no role at all to play in Canada, have no worth or value as autistics, and ideally would not exist at all. This government hopes for a Canada free of autistic people, a Canada where all autistic traits and abilities have been stamped out. I've phoned someone in Mr Clement's office and asked if they were sure this is what they wanted to promote as public policy. And were they aware of what the consequences would be to autistic peoople, of having our government tell Canadians that autistic people are unwanted and unwelcome in Canada, and that it would be so much better if we were extinguished.  In the recent autism \"debates\" in Canada's House of Commons, there have been many self-congratulatory comments about how productive it is to have all the major national political parties agreeing on an issue, and working together towards the same goal. It should be clear what this goal is.  The  MP Ruby Dhalla  articulates the Liberal Party of Canada position about autism: I am sure this national strategy is going to ensure that we have the proper investment to do further research into whether there are other treatment options available and into how this type of condition can be prevented. Here is the  MP Peter Stoffer , articulating the official position of the New Democratic Party of Canada: We need to find out what causes autism, what we can do to prevent it from happening, if that is possible.  That's Canada's three major national political parties, and all three agree that autistic people should not exist. Society, according to our government and the major national opposition parties, should consist entirely of non-autistic people. Autistics are sick, and this sickness has to be eradicated, for the good of society.  The MP who is most responsible for these autism \"debates\" taking place, the  Liberal Andy Scott , opened the first \"debate\" in the House of Commons by referring to the many autism advocates he consulted with before deciding on the future of autistics in Canada: They are Canadians concerned about something that is unfinished business for Canada.  That unfinished business is the unacceptable continued existence of autistic people in Canada. All our major political parties are determined to make autism into a very finished business. Right now, they want all autistics in medical treatment until we are no longer autistic, but they are also demanding that autism be prevented, so that no more autistic people are born. They don't want autistic people in Canada at all. They see our existence as being wrong, as being diseased, as being a burden on non-autistic people, as being bad for Canada, as being an insult against what Canada stands for. There is no one to disagree with them, as these non-autistic leaders  work hard together on their important eugenic agenda.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/2006/2006_111bk1_e.html", "http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=2445158&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1", "http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=2445158&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/11/canadas-eugenic-government.html", "title": "\n"},

I find her published work very interesting and informative, even though I would tend to dispute how she and her group sometimes interpret their findings. Likewise, I find her ideas worth a lot of attention, without necessarily agreeing with her. This is from a 2005 editorial by Nancy Minshew in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, of which she is an associate editor: A third issue raised by the studies in this issue is the degree to which theories once proposed have been held sacrosanct. The executive function and central coherence theories have held nearly sacred status for at least a decade and a half. This has in some cases meant that papers submitted with data or ideas that did not support these theories were frequently rejected or sternly directed to revisions that conformed. This is not a problem unique to these two theories. This has gone on for as long as there has been autism research. Autism is a field that seems to worship its theories and theories appear to assume a position of far greater value than the data or the search for an answer\u2014the purpose that theories are supposed to serve. Theories are essentially hypotheses or theoretical constructs that formulate what we know into a scientifically reasonable question about what we know and we don\u2019t know but propose to test with the next phase of research. Theories are by definition disposable or under reconstruction and the sooner the better. The goal of the theory is the same as a canoe--to get across or up the stream. Once we learn what we need to know from the trip, we take the canoe apart and use the materials to build the next transport. The near death grip on theories by this field has impeded progress. It has also isolated the field of autism to some extent from mainstream science. Some theories and conceptualizations held within autism are not mainstream science. Somehow autism evolves its own lingo or pragmatics that is idiosyncratic. When this happens, it can repel senior scientists from other fields of expertise highly relevant to autism who find these idiosyncrasies nonsensical and too much of an added burden to deal with. It also confines the field of autism to what it knows rather than stretching outside its traditional behavioral origins to fully embrace neuroscience. Autism needs these scientists and neuroscience. It is important that open mindedness be a goal so that insularity and circular logic is avoided. Autism will not benefit from evolving its own language of science that is different from the mainstream. Reference: Minshew, N. (2005). Ask the editor.

{"date": "Sunday, December 03, 2006", "body": "\nBelow are a few pieces (not very organized) of my informal and personal writing about autism and self-injury. I wrote these pieces for various reasons and various people, and they go back a ways. The last piece, which I wrote a long time ago on the TMoB board, was also included as part of my Statement of Particulars in my Canadian Human Rights Tribunal case.  The science in this area is extremely poor (as was testified at the Tribunal). When I wrote the below, Keen (2005) and Keen et al. (2005) had not yet been published. Both these papers support my informal observations in the area of autistic communication, as does the success of interventions designed to train parents to respond to their autistic children's communication (e.g., Aldred et al., 2004). Gernsbacher (2006) is an excellent review of this area. I also strongly recommend  this , re the origins of so-called \"challenging\" behaviours from an autistic viewpoint.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Self-injury doesn't happen out of the blue, though it's often reported this way, and doesn't result from \"autism\". I've written a bit about self-injury (my self-injury has been an issue in many legal cases). It might help to remember that privacy is an issue (meaning, it bugs me to write about self-injury, even though it's probably important that autistics write about this), and also that a lot of autistics don't have or can't reliably achieve privacy, and this has consequences. Two things essential to a lot of autistics: privacy (being able to hide) and freedom(being able to leave), and we're extremely likely to be deprived of both. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I disagree strongly with the kinds of functional analyses of behaviour I see all the time in ABA programs, where the behaviour analyst makes all kinds of assumptions about the autistic, based on their ignorance of how autistics perceive the world and learn from it, and their total dismissal of our communication. This results in \"last straw\" behaviours. Your child communicates accurately to you a basic need, over and over, maybe ten or twelve (almost always this number) times. This is ignored, both because his kind of communication is considered \"wrong\", and because what he needs, which is different from what you need, is also \"wrong\". Then, having been honest and conscientious in his communication, and having been crushed by repeated failure, the kid bangs his head or hits someone or breaks something. This is then the ONE behaviour that is noticed and analyzed. Then the child is taught how to communicate (he communicated perfectly in the first place, so really he is taught his own communication is wrong), and what he is allowed to communicate--not his real need (and this is almost always \"need to know something\", \"need this small piece of information\", or \"need many, many pieces of information\" when it is not \"I am in pain and must deal with this\") but the need everyone else has decided he was expressing when his behaviour became unacceptable. This happens to autistics who can talk, and talk very well, and are even called articulate, so speech (and speech is different from language or communication) is not the issue. One of the hardest things that happens to some autistics is that after a great struggle to produce speech, we find it doesn't work either, it just continues to be exhausting. This is because our needs are different from non-autistic needs and our needs are called \"wrong\". And I mean what we need in order to learn, to achieve, to interact, to develop--our needs in all these areas are different. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I was asked in a documentary why I hurt myself. This was some years ago; I was just at the point where I was starting to realize I was not totally appalling because I was autistic. I was in an \"environment\" where no other conclusion was available. Anyway, what I said when I was asked was that it (hurting myself) was my vocabulary. I have to add at this point that the fact that I hurt myself is obvious, even though I hurt myself in private. I have scars. Then I said that I'd worked hard all my life to learn language. This was very, very difficult and took pretty much all my resources. But I learned, and I learned two languages. Then I found out this language thing didn't work; I was not good enough at it; I somehow did it wrong. My very accurate words weren't heard. I was and am frequently told I've said things I've never said, and haven't said things I have. I hurt myself to re-establish some form of accuracy. I establish something I've absolutely done. This is a way of regaining accuracy. So while it may seem that I'm frustrated, that isn't the case. Confusion, yes to some degree. But there is an essential need to re-establish, after repeated failed communication, the existence of accuracy, or at least the possibility of accuracy, in order to continue to function at all. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- References: Aldred, C., Green, J., & Adams, C.

{"date": "Monday, November 27, 2006", "body": "\nHarold Doherty is a leading Canadian autism advocate. He has a blog, on which he has just posted his expert opinion (Mr Doherty is a lawyer)  about a legal case I lost a long time ago . I lost this case for two separate reasons, reasons which are clear if you read the full, original decision.  The first reason is that in Canada, the Labour Code only protects workers who are judged to be \"normal\", as opposed to all those who are able to perform any particular job. So those who are not deemed \"normal\" are considered to have a \"medical condition\", are not protected, and can be obliged to do pretty much anything by their employers, even if it is dangerous to them. E.g., while it is illegal to put a hearing person in danger by not providing proper ear protection in a noisy environment, it is not illegal to put a deaf person in danger by removing from their workplace the kinds of information they need in order to work safely. The deaf person is considered to have a \"medical condition\", even in a workplace where s/he has advantages over hearing persons, and not to be entitled to a safe workplace under this law. I used this specific example when I argued the appeal. The second reason is that what I was being asked to do was not part of my job description, and therefore did not fall under the law. That is, if an employer asks you to do something dangerous, you cannot use this law to refuse, if this something is not part of your job description.  The original decision hinged on wording that was only available in one language, an anomaly which caused a lot of dictionary-searching. It was long ago (regardless of Mr Doherty presenting this as news), but I vividly remember the extent to which the original decision was based on semantics. The first reason, as described above, is problematic. It means if you are not \"normal\" (by the definition of whoever decides these things), no matter how well you do your work, you can be gratuitously put in danger at any time by your employer, and you do not have the right to refuse to do what they demand. Your only recourse is a human rights case, which would involve losing your job and taking years and years to fight (at your own expense) for an uncertain outcome. However, Mr Doherty is not objecting to this interpretation of the law, but to the fact that I contested it. In my case, I was gratuitously put in danger, and this continued for a long time with multiple variations on the theme. Mr Doherty's complete response to this is in the link above, including the derisive implication that I was arguing that autism is an occupational hazard. No, Mr Doherty, I was arguing that the consequences of disability-based harassment and discrimination, including the disregarding of relevant laws and contracts, are hazardous in many ways, including to one's safety.  This is my response to Mr Doherty, major league Canadian autism advocate, and his views of an autistic adult attempting to make workplaces safe for autistic people.  I've also posted this response  here . The CSST (a French acronym) is Quebec's workers health and safety board. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That is an extremely and deliberately misleading subject line.  I had a better safety and work record than most Canada Post letter carriers, and maintained this for a long time. It was recognized, e.g., that I could work safely, accurately and quickly in hazardous conditions that my co-workers refused to work in.  This case involved an illegal (no legal or contractual basis, no credible reason of any kind was ever given) expertise which was scheduled in many contradictory ways, including without notice. Notice was required, both under the law and under the collective agreement.  Provincial but not federal jurisdiction workers are protected from this kind of harassment under a provincial law (ARIAOD, administered by the CSST). This kind of harassment, in my case, set precedents such that no one knew what to do or how to apply the law.  For example, apart from never agreeing with themselves over why an expertise was being demanded (only about half the time was I told it had something to do with the short, long-ago work accident), Canada Post management threatened me with disciplinary action if I refused to see a doctor who did not exist. This \"doctor\" was not listed as a doctor anywhere in Quebec, and it turned out that indeed, he did not exist.  Throughout the time of this case, and long after, I was at work and doing my job to the usual \"exemplary\" (Canada Post's word, in writing) standards. My attendance record was recognized as superb, with extremely infrequent absences for any reason.  The expertise was never related to autism, though multiple conflicting reasons for this expertise were given by Canada Post. Sometimes different reasons were given on the same day, as the threat continued for months. The duly certified injury on duty leave lasted 4 days and was my first declared work accident for 8 years. Canada Post failed to ask for an expertise within the time allowed for by the CSST's law (ARIAOD), but continued to demand an expertise for months after the time allowed, though for multiple different and contradictory reasons not founded in any contractual or legal right on their part.  I don't know about the autistics Mr Doherty works with, but it has been very dangerous for me and many other autistic adults to see health-care professionals who have no knowledge of autism--the kind of professional I was being forced to see. This was regardless that it was suggested (by doctors) that I see doctors who were knowledgeable in autism, something I would have been willing to do if a credible reason were provided for an expertise. Instead, the suggestion that I see doctors who had some familiarity with autism (doctors I had never seen before and didn't know of) was rejected by Canada Post. The obstacle to employment for autistics here is not a failed attempt to protect us from being put into danger via gratuitous threats of an illegal medical expertise. The obstacle comes from a psychologist (a behaviour analyst) who recently informed Canada Post at the national level that there is nothing good about autistic people. This psychologist promoted a dire view of autistics as being less than human (e.g., we have no emotions) and good for nothing (e.g., if we have any abilities, we use them in totally useless ways), which Canada Post took and continues to take to heart. Yes, this psychologist was prosecuted for her grossly biased presentation and for conflict of interest (I was her client) by the Quebec Order of Psychologists, but it was already far too late. Having a long-standing excellent work record, including in the area of safety, does not protect you against this kind of professionally-promoted prejudice. All of the above has been testified to, complete with hundreds of pages of evidence (some of it publicly available), at the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, in the first autism-related case referred for a hearing there. This case is the result of my revealing my diagnosis to Canada Post after 11 years of service, and succeeds a previous Canadian Human Rights Commission case that was settled in my favour.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's unclear what Mr Doherty would have wanted me to do. He does seem to be implying--I'm sure he'll correct me if I'm wrong--that an autistic who knows a medical expertise is likely to be dangerous should not be believed, even when (as in my case) she has medical documentation to back her up. And nor, apparently, should any consideration be given to engaging a medical professional who has some knowledge of autism. This is typical of how my attempts to stay autonomous--and not require a high level of services, and to basically survive--have been dealt with by Canada's important autism advocates.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2006/11/michelle-dawson-v-canada-post.html", "http://www.quicktopic.com/27/H/vJvhV4fDnBgw7/m5183"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/11/harold-doherty-autism-advocate-at-work.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, November 26, 2006", "body": "\nBased on the arguments and testimony of autism advocates (parents, professionals, government officials, etc.), the jurisprudence for autistics in Canada is premised on the assumption that autistics are inherently doomed, and that we destroy ourselves, our families, our communities, and of course the economy. Our essential differences are judged to be bizarre, unwanted, dreaded, repugnant, and harmful to ourselves and others. We are judged to have nothing at all to contribute to society, instead being a vast drain on personal and public resources. Our jurisprudence says we just naturally belong in institutions, allowing our autism advocates to elaborate that terrible things must be done to us in these institutions, this being just how autistics should be treated. Because of how horrible and less-than-human we are. The jurisprudence says so. Legal decisions--the lower court Auton decisions and the Wynberg trial decision--that grossly dehumanize autistics have been overturned. This has resulted in extreme protests from autism advocates, who cannot tolerate even the possibility that autistics might be human, might have personhood, might merit basic human rights as autistic people. Autism advocates insist that autistics have humanity and are persons and have basic human rights only if and when we are intensively trained via ABA to be less autistic or not autistic at all. Once we can suffiently pass for normal, then and only then may we be considered to be human and treated as such.  The overturned decisions remain, regardless, in our jurisprudence, being quoted in the House of Commons and the Senate and in other legal decisions, and otherwise governing the lives of autistics in Canada. In contrast, here is some jurisprudence for non-autistic Canadians (I've taken out the citations): It is an unfortunate truth that the history of disabled persons in Canada is largely one of exclusion and marginalization. Persons with disabilities have too often been excluded from the labour force, denied access to opportunities for social interaction and advancement, subjected to invidious stereotyping and relegated to institutions [...] This historical disadvantage has to a great extent been shaped and perpetuated by the notion that disability is an abnormality or flaw. As a result, disabled persons have not generally been afforded the \u201cequal concern, respect and consideration\u201d that s. 15(1) of the Charter demands. Instead, they have been subjected to paternalistic attitudes of pity and charity, and their entrance into the social mainstream has been conditional upon their emulation of ablebodied norms [...] One consequence of these attitudes is the persistent social and economic disadvantage faced by the disabled.  Our powerful and influential autism advocates have ensured that it is now inconceivable that autistics would fall under this kind of jurisprudence. Instead, they have demanded and ensured that emulation of the norm is our only avenue to obtain even the most basic human rights. That would include the right not to be abused in institutions, this institutionalization and this abuse being  not only condoned but promoted by our autism advocates and our national media  as what we deserve--unless we undergo unlimited medically necessary ABA and become sufficiently normal. The legal decision above continues: Deaf persons have not escaped this general predicament. Although many of them resist the notion that deafness is an impairment and identify themselves as members of a distinct community with its own language and culture, this does not justify their compelled exclusion from the opportunities and services designed for and otherwise available to the hearing population. For many hearing persons, the dominant perception of deafness is one of silence. This perception has perpetuated ignorance of the needs of deaf persons and has resulted in a society that is for the most part organized as though everyone can hear [...]  This legal decision was handed down by the Supreme Court of Canada almost 10 years ago ( Eldridge  v.  British Columbia (Attorney General),  [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624). This year, in another legal battle (argued by a Deaf lawyer), sign language has  become a  de facto  official language in Canada.  The judge in this case wrote: \"It is fundamental to an inclusive society that those with disabilities be accommodated when interacting with the institutions of government.\" Nearly 10 years after Auton started its way through the courts, autistics are as far from achieving inclusion or accommodation as is possible. We are considered not only to be abnormal and flawed, but sick, diseased, less than human, and doomed. This is consequent to the work of autism advocates. We are subject not only to pity and charity, but to constant messages that we are unwanted and ghastly burdens, and dreaded and feared inhuman collections of senseless, useless, repulsive and dangerous behaviours. And we are frequently treated as such. This too is the work of autism advocates. We daily live the consequences of \"invidious stereotypes\" and multiple other forms of denigration, all aggressively promoted by those who claim to represent us and who demand that our dehumanization and denigration be enshrined in our law once and for all.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cad.ca/english/home/deaf_federal_decision_-_press_release.pdf"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/11/jurisprudence-for-autistics-and-non.html", "title": "\n"},

Then Ms Wente introduces one of the sources of this information, who is a leading Canadian autism advocate (and FEAT director): \"My son is in a mainstream class. He goes to other kids' birthday parties,\" says Jean Lewis. She is the mother of an autistic 12-year-old and also a director of a B.C. parents' lobby group. Where would her son be without treatment? \"He wouldn't be living at home,\" she says. \"Without treatment, kids like this are usually institutionalized by the time they're adolescents. They're living in restraints, living in diapers. They have to have their teeth removed because they bite.\"  Now the \"choice\" for autistics is either to undergo unlimited \"medically necessary\" ABA (no other kind will do), or to be institutionalized, to live in restraints  and  to have our teeth pulled. Maybe institutions have gotten to be old hat. Maybe the powers that be have become inured their daily bombardment of messages that autistics just naturally belong in institutions. So Ms Lewis, being an eminent autism advocate, had to make things a little more compelling.  In Ms Wente's column, Ms Lewis is describing the same autistic boy who Michael Lewis, her husband,  promised to institutionalize  \"immediately\" or \"shortly thereafter\" if ever his ABA program stops for any reason. I'm pretty sure it's hard for Ms Wente and Ms Lewis to imagine what it's like, to wonder if you'll lose your freedom, again, because so many important people keep dehumanizing you and insisting you don't belong in families or society, but in institutions and in restraints. And then to wonder if, next time, they'll also pull your teeth. Because Ms Lewis says that's what we need. And Ms Wente reports this uncritically. The end of Ms Wente's column reveals a further source of Ms Wente's information. That would be the Autism Speaks video,   \"Autism Every Day\" , which Ms Wente describes as \"a glimpse of a day in the life of autism parents\". She fails to see \"Autism Every Day\" as a glimpse at what autistic children have to endure, every day, when they are seen as appalling burdens, when they're talked around and shunted around  as though they're non-sentient props . Ms Wente demonstrates that when you dehumanize autistics enough, as Ms Lewis so proficiently does, right down to pulling our teeth if we don't behave, then we disappear altogether, so that the only humans Ms Wente can perceive in \"Autism Every Day\" are the parents.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20061121.COWENT21/TPStory/National/columnists", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/autism-speaks-dont-speak-for-me/index.php", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=105"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/11/dehumanization-specialists.html", "title": "\n"},

(1967): Reinforcement was given in the form of small bites of the child's food, such as pieces of Sugar Flakes, a breakfast cereal. As learning progressed, evidenced by the fact that the child might occasionally emit an approximation to the current response without prompts, food reinforcement was withheld for prompted behavior and only delivered contingent upon unprompted behavior. This step is a rather important one in the training, since continual reinforcement for prompted behavior probably would prevent a shift into imitative responding. The use of food as reinforcement apparently \"forces\" the child to behave correctly. We have observed that some children would not acquire new responses unless it was impossible for them to survive without the new learning, i.e., unless their sustenance was contingent upon the new learning. Stated differently, social rewards, such as attention and approval, which effectively control the behavior of most individuals were inadequate during these early stages of learning. The child not only did not learn, but became very uncooperative and tantrumous. Reference: Lovaas, O.I., Freitas, L., Nelson, K., & Whalen, C. (1967).

{"date": "Sunday, November 19, 2006", "body": "\nWhen some kinds of human beings are devalued, the people doing the devaluing often work to enshrine this devaluation in  written  and unwritten laws, rules, and regulations. The purpose of the rules is to make sure those lesser humans don't get in the way of the real ones. A lot of creative, meaning destructive, ways have been found to keep humans deemed to be substandard in our substandard place. A Canadian Senate committee (the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology) is holding hearings about autism treatment funding, and about a national autism strategy, at the demand of Senator Jim Munson. Senator Munson equates autism with cancer and promotes the view that unless autistics get early ABA/IBI,  almost all of us just naturally belong in institutions . This view is  unsupported by the existing science  and instead reflects Senator Munson's view of autistics as sick, substandard human beings who, unless we become much less autistic or not autistic at all, do not belong in society. Senator Munson is also one of the Senators in the Committee holding hearings to decide the future of autistics in Canada. This committee has just decided to ban autistics from participating in the major meeting of their series of autism hearings. This is a round table meeting scheduled for December 8, 2006. The purpose of the round table is to discuss autism research in Canada. Non-autistic autism researchers and two parent organizations (which are also appearing as witnesses elsewhere in the hearings) are invited. These parent organizations are the FEAT-like Autism Society Canada and the DAN!-like Autism Canada Foundation.  Autistics have been banned before . One of the ways our leaders, our autism community leaders and our political leaders, let us know that autistics are substandard, and therefore put us in our place, is by making a rule that autistics aren't allowed to participate when autism research is being discussed. Research is a non-autistics only water fountain. Autistics have a separate, unequal water fountain down the hall, a place where research is never discussed, where decisions about research are never made. We're not allowed to go near that non-autistics only fountain. It's against the rules. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research of course agrees to ban autistics--look at their name, Canadian Institutes of Health  Research , which is an automatic instruction for autistics to give up our seats. Or rather, stay away from that fountain. One of the groups listed as a witness at the Senate autism hearings is the Canadian Autism Intervention Research Network. They've banned autistics from their fancy conferences too. It's not hard--they're invitation only conferences, so they just don't invite autistics. And they have no autistics anywhere in their governance. After all, they too have  Research  in their name, and everyone knows that's a non-autistics only water fountain. You have to figure it was  a priori  guaranteed that the  Canadian Autism  Research  Workshop , which combined Autism Society Canada--a paragon of  putting autistics in our place , the CIHR, Autism Speaks (who exclude autistics automatically, as a sort of reflex), as well as some people from CAIRN, and a whole lot of government people, like the Office for Disability Issues and Health Canada, would bar autistics, except as lunch time entertainment for the important non-autistic decision-makers. Similarly, the Senate Committee people told me that if I appear in their hearings, I can't be put with a particular group of witnesses, because these witnesses are researchers. This Committee just can't have autistics near that non-autistics only  fountain. We just get in the way and mess things up, being the substandard types we are (the sick, if not cancerous, ABA/IBI-deprived autistics Senator Munson says belong in institutions). Parents, on the other hand, are autism research experts and essential contributing stakeholders by definition, so long as they're non-autistic. If you're an autistic parent, sorry, your fountain is down the hall and nowhere near anything related to research. That's the rules. I've had it explained to me, many times, v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y, that this is  research , as if I only had to be told this important fact to realize how totally  absurd  it is to even  imagine  that autistics would have anything to contribute or  anything at stake . The decision-makers I've spoken with have been utterly baffled when I didn't fold up and skitter away in abject shame when they said that magic word,  research , the one supposed to make all autistics disappear instantly. This Senate Committee claims they'll have a few autistic witnesses in their hearings, all at a safe distance from that non-autistics only fountain, though none has yet appeared and none is yet in the published schedule. Indeed, on one day next week, they have a full slate of six autism organizations (including one which isn't an autism organization but pretends to be), none of which is represented by an autistic person.  In a  their previous report  (warning, big pdf), this very same Senate Committee wrote: In future, we hope to have the opportunity to undertake a thematic study on autism. Meanwhile, we advocate a fuller debate among all stakeholders. In particular, the Committee believes that persons living with autism must be recognized as full and equal partners in the discussion. Full and equal? Excuse me Senators, but you've banned us, on the grounds that we  don't belong at the table when major and crucial decisions about us--decisions about autism research--are being hammered out. I've raised a ruckus about this. I don't see a lot of issues a whole lot more important than the \"full and equal\" participation of autistics in discussions and decisions about research priority, policy, and design. Right now, very nearly one hundred per cent of these discussions and decisions are happening with zero per cent autistic input. And now our political leaders in the Canadian Senate have banned us again. Shame on them, for perpetuating grossly prejudicial stereotypes about autistics and autism research. Shame on them, for seeing us as unwanted impediments to the important non-autistic people they welcome to sit at the round table and decide our future. Shame on them, for refusing to see us as essential contributors, both to society and to any discussion about autism research. Shame on them, for refusing to see us as human beings who live and suffer the consequences of decisions made about us in our absence. Etc. Shame, shame, shame.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws", "http://www.parl.gc.ca/39/1/parlbus/chambus/senate/deb-e/pdf/013db_2006-05-11-E.pdf", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_vic.html#c", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_pp.html", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_pp.html", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_one.html", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_wp.html", "http://www.parl.gc.ca/39/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/soci-e/rep-e/pdf/rep02may06part1-e.pdf"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/11/non-autistics-only-fountain-in-canadas.html", "title": "\n"},

In reality, this famous study is evidence that an early intensive behaviour intervention wasn't effective at all, for even a minority of autistics--not without the unacceptable systematic use of physical punishment. Lovaas and colleagues instead provide guidance in how to spot  ineffective  (meaning, e.g., grossly inadequate, and possibly harmful) interventions or programs. These would be interventions or programs accompanied by claims or evidence that unless autistics are deliberately and systematically hurt, we will fail to learn and/or are doomed. Would our influential autism advocates call a preschool program for non-autistics \"effective\" if the kids only made meaningful progress when they were hit? And if our eminent autism advocates wouldn't, why are they insisting that autistics deserve such lousy standards?  ... until autism advocates stop using the Auton trial decision, the New York State Dept. of Health report, and the US Surgeon General's report as \"proof\" that ABA-based interventions are \"effective\".  All these popular lobbying tools are heavily dependent on Lovaas (1987) and McEachin et al. (1993). Using them sends the same message as the invariable flourishing of the famous 47%: that it's acceptable to use aversives on autistic children when ABA-based interventions do not otherwise work. This is the current-day rationale for existing aversive interventions, including those provided at the JRC.  ... until autism advocates stop claiming that ABA-based interventions are \"effective\" for all autistics, and that all autistics are doomed without ABA. This follows from the previous point. According to the published data, and by their own standards, ABA programs fail more often than not; in the current climate, autistics who do poorly in ABA programs are likely to stay in them indefinitely. But there are also some parents and professionals who claim that when non-aversive ABA fails, the necessary next step is the use of aversives. There's Matson (2006), who raises concerns that non-aversive ABA programs are excluding autistic children who really  need  aversives. Kit Weintraub's letters and the vehement support for the JRC, the routine use of risperidone or other anti-psychotics as part of some ABA programs,  etc., are examples of how uncritical cheerleading of ABA programs can be seriously hazardous for autistics who do poorly in ABA.  ... until autism advocates stop their extraordinary campaign to deny autistics basic standards of science and ethics, and basic human rights. This campaign ( here's a popular example ; links to another popular example, Canada's autism community flagship website, can be found within  my response to it ) being, with occasional digressions, the subject of this blog ... So long as autistics are feared, dreaded, unwanted, dehumanized, reduced to drains on society, written off, and have our voices denied, there will always be those who can, with impunity, claim that we really  need  to be hurt, or we are doomed. So long as it is so vigorously argued that there is nothing worse than being autistic, then it will remain acceptable to treat us in ways that would never be acceptable for other human beings.  ... until aversives are illegal, everywhere.

{"date": "Saturday, November 18, 2006", "body": "\nThe Globe and Mail today started a series about cancer in Canada. I'm working my way through a long article, in multiple parts, called  Cancer: A day in the life  . The article works through one day, in increments of time, describing the lives of 60 people with cancer at that time. I'm still in the morning of this day. I'm maybe a quarter of the way through. All these people are dying, except two who seem to be doing well. There is  an audio slide show about a young child with cancer , who did not survive, but will never be forgotten. The introduction states that cancer kills 193 Canadians a day, or about 70,000 a year. Canada doesn't have a national cancer strategy, as is noted in an  accompanying editorial . The words \"scourge\", \"torment\", \"affliction\" and \"horrific\" are used in this editorial. We are so used to those words being used to describe the existence of healthy autistic people. Autism is routinely equated with cancer. Or we're told  it's worse than cancer , because it doesn't kill us--if only autism were fatal, we would all be better off. The autism advocate Andrew Kavchak states that his autistic son would be better off if he had cancer. The famous behaviour analyst, Gina Green, equates autism with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and ABA-based autism interventions with treatment for this kind of  malignant cancer . The only difference between autism and leukemia that Dr Green can spot is that there's \"probably more known scientifically about ALL than autism\" and \"there are reliable, objective tests for diagnosing ALL\". Nowhere does Dr Green mention that without treatment, ALL kills people  in about 3 months .  I don't think ABA advocates like Dr Green, and Mr Kavchak, and so many others who glibly use cancer analogies, really see any difference between a cancer that kills people and autistic traits and abilities. They see autistic traits and abilities as needing eradication just as much as malignant cancerous cells and tumours.  Canada is much more likely to get a national autism strategy--with the goal not of helping autistic people, but of attacking autistic traits and abilities as though they were malignant--than a national cancer strategy. Parents with autistic children who, according to their parents, are as sick as or even sicker than children dying of cancer command a lot of respect, as they speak of devastation and tragedy, of how their children are doomed, of losing a child to autism, as if an autistic child is a dead child. No one has questioned them, or their goal of having autism treated as if it were a dreaded fatal disease. Meanwhile,  193 people are killed by cancer every day in Canada .  References: Green, G.

{"date": "Sunday, November 12, 2006", "body": "\nIn parts one and two I looked at some of the claims made in Sabrina Freeman's book, \"Science for Sale in the Autism Wars\", in the section called \"The Classic Aversives Ruse\".  Another of her claims is that behaviour analysts didn't stop systematically using physical aversives in early ABA programs because this practice became unacceptable. Instead, behaviour analysts found that aversives weren't genuinely effective, and altered their practices accordingly. To support this view, Dr Freeman provides evidence from a 1996 Canadian TV documentary in which Ivar Lovaas appeared and explained the methodological reasons why he abandoned aversives. She also provides a quote from Smith and Lovaas (1997), and also lists three \"replication studies\" in which aversives weren't used, but which had \"significant and impressive\" results. Is Dr Freeman right?  Re Dr Lovaas' turn on TV, using a TV program as a credible source for scientific information seems like a bad idea. But it's consistent with the standards that our finest autism advocates have decided are good for autistics. Autism advocates in Canada have also used education numbers as epidemiology. They've promoted the use of legal decisions, opinion polls, \"fact\" sheets, political speeches and media reports as credible sources of information about autism and autism treatment, often without bothering with primary sources in peer-reviewed science (see an example  here ).  Setting aside Dr Lovaas' TV appearance, Smith and Lovaas (1997) is a published rejoinder to criticisms of the UCLA Young Autism Project. It doesn't contain data reporting the success of a non-aversive early ABA program. Instead, in responding to concerns that Lovaas (1987) depended on the use of physical aversives, Smith and Lovaas state that since the time that study began (in the early 1970s), advances in research have \"rendered such procedures unnecessary\". However, this paper provides no evidence, and no references, indicating what these advances might may be, when they were introduced, when they replaced aversives at UCLA, etc. As for the three \"replication studies\" cited by Dr Freeman, one is an uncontrolled trial (Anderson et al., 1987), one is a retrospective study (not a true experimental design) which has been roundly condemned by Dr Lovaas (Sheinkopf & Seigel, 1998; Lovas, 2002), and one is a non-randomized controlled trial which now has a presented follow-up showing that the few autistic children who did well did not maintain this ten years later (Birnbrauer & Leach, 1993, 2006). Not one of these three studies reports even one child who achieved normal functioning in the short term, by the criteria in Lovaas (1987). So what other evidence is there, besides Dr Freeman's, about why and when aversives stopped being used at UCLA in ABA programs for autistic kids? Is there any evidence for when those advances in research, the ones making aversives obsolete, actually occurred?  Lovaas (2002) writes: Contingent aversives were employed in the Lovaas (1987) study. Many states now prohibit the use of aversives, and many parents object to such treatment. Either of these factors could prevent replication of the Lovaas (1987) study. However, although the UCLA Young Autism Project no longer uses aversives, we have taken advantage of alternatives to aversives developed during and after the time of the 1987 study was completed (treatment in the Lovaas, 1987, study took place between 1970 and 1984). Again, there are no references pointing to primary sources reporting data from non-aversive early ABA programs. However, Dr Lovaas doesn't appear to be claiming, as Dr Freeman does, that the unacceptability of aversives (including their illegality) played no role at all in altering the practices of behaviour analysts.  Then there's Smith, Groen and Wynn (2000, 2001). This is the only existing randomized controlled trial of an early ABA program. This study took place at UCLA, involved researchers trained and overseen by Dr Lovaas, and involved, in sequence, all children who were referred to the UCLA YAP between 1989 and 1992. The authors report how their treatment differed from the treatment in Lovaas (1987): Finally, though contingent aversives were employed briefly with the first 4 children, they were then stopped for all children, whereas Lovaas (1987) employed this intervention more extensively. So we now know when aversives stopped being used at UCLA: sometime between the 4th and 5th referred child in Smith et al. (2000). It seems unlikely that the original plan was to use aversives with some children and not others; there is, in any case, no mention of this by the authors, who report other abandoned plans. Instead, it seems more plausible that the authors had started by using aversives with the intention of having this as part of the treatment for all the experimental group children. Something then happened between child 4 and child 5 such that child 5 (and all the children after) didn't receive aversives at all, and aversives were removed from the treatment of the first 4 children. This seems to narrow down the time when, apparently, there were these reported advances in research, and it was decided that they should supplant the use of the now unnecessary and ineffective aversives. Or possibly something else happened. In 1991, a law was passed in California, making the use of physical punishment in behaviour programs illegal. This law was first introduced in 1990. In 1989, it may have already been known that such a law was going to be proposed.  So we know that aversives were considered \"effective\" at UCLA at least into 1989. If they were not, it would have been grossly unethical to use them on the first 4 children in Smith et al. (2000). It's possible that sometime between child 4 and child 5 in Smith et al. (2000), there was suddenly an advance in research allowing for the abandonment of the suddenly non-effective and unnecessary aversives (for which these researchers must have received the requisite institutional review board permission). Or it's possible that this was about the time it became known that this procedure--physical punishment--was likely to become illegal in California. Dr Freeman's book was published in 2003, but she doesn't mention Smith et al. (2000), the only direct evidence of exactly when aversives were abandoned by the UCLA YAP. As to why, there is no way precisely to know, unless Drs Lovaas or Smith decide to disclose this information. However, the evidence doesn't entirely support Dr Freeman's account. There's still the problem of Dr Lovaas taking the trouble to  prove how effective contingent aversives were in his famous 1987 paper . And the available evidence does strain the credibility of the assertion that it was advances in research which solely were responsible for the UCLA YAP's apparently sudden about-face re aversives.

I was so impressed by Dr. Israel. I have two kids with autism, one, a girl, twelve, who is extremely self-injurious. We have run a very high quality ABA program for her for years, but could never get rid of the self-injurious behaviors. Only on risperdal are they reduced, and we have seen her gain close to 100 lbs on the medication. We have had all sorts of behavioral experts come in and try to extinguish the behavior with positive behavioral interventions, unfortunately, they did not work. No one wants to try electric shock with their child, it is a last resort, but I would do it in a heartbeat if I could get my precious child to stop hurting herself. Is the risperdal less abusive? Weight gain, tardive dyskinesia, disabetes, Dr. Leventhal has no answers. I am sorry you had to be subjected to his condemnation, but you carried yourself with grace and dignity. Thank you.

You are welcome to use my comments on your blog. I have been a very outspoken advocate for behavioral treatments that raise the quality of life for our children. It is not easy to stand up for the truth, and the truth is, for some kids, aversives are all that keep them from killing themselves or others. No one should be judged or condemned for earnestly trying to extinguish dangerous behaviors in children who cannot be taught by any other means. It never fails to amaze me that people don't get the difference between beating a child and using an aversive under controlled circumstances in the presence of extreme behavior that has not responded to anything. Leventhal was lying. There are kids for whom nothing besides aversive behavioral interventions works short of drugging them into a stupor. Good God, what parent wants to be in the position, or what clinician, for that matter, of choosing electric shock or watching their child put their eye out? Bottom line is, I guess most people would rather see the kid put their eye out, and just wring their hands and shrug their shoulders. I guess I am preaching to the choir. I have been lambasted, too, for supporting aversives in extreme last-resort circumstances too, so I guess I can somewhat relate to what you and your staff must be going through. It is hard. No one likes being called a child abuser. Thanks for all that you do. Kit Weintraub mother to Emily and Nicholas Weintraub --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As I wrote earlier, the JRC isn't widely admired by behaviour analysts, and I've assumed it isn't admired by autism advocates in Canada and elsewhere. I would never dispute Ms Weintraub's claim that she is a \"very outspoken advocate\", and she clearly has many important supporters, among whom ASAT and Canada's leading autism advocates are prominent. For this reason, among many others, it's important to know what exactly Ms Weintraub is advocating for, and what some of the consequences of this kind of advocacy are, for autistic children and adults.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://judgerotenbergcenter.blogspot.com/2006/04/comments-submitted-to-jrc-from-mother.html", "http://boston.com/news/daily/15/school_report.pdf"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/11/very-outspoken-advocate.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, November 09, 2006", "body": "\nIn her book \"Science for Sale in the Autism Wars\" (p68), Sabrina Freeman states that only four of the 19 experimental group autistic children in Lovaas (1987) received a treatment including physical aversives, thus minimizing their role in this landmark study. As often happens with statements from Canada's leading autism advocates, it's impossible to say whether Dr Freeman is unfamiliar with the scientific literature, or is familiar with it and is misrepresenting it. Lovaas (1987) identifies \"a slap on the thigh\" (along with \"a loud 'no'\") as part of the treatment for the 19 autistic children in the experimental group, but not for the 19 autistic children in Control Group 1, in his main experiment. By his \"main experiment\", I mean the non-randomized controlled trial with the celebrated 47% rate of \"normal functioning\" as its experimental group's outcome. This use of aversives is reiterated in Lovaas and Smith's (1988) more detailed description of the study reported in Lovaas (1987).  However, as I've  previously written , Dr Lovaas also took measures to demonstrate that this \"aversive procedure\", as Dr Freeman puts it in her book, was an effective and indeed essential component in the treatment received by the 19 experimental group children. This involved what Dr Lovaas called a \"within-subjects replication design\", in which the use of physical aversives was manipulated in four children from the experimental group and four from Control Group 1. This study-within-a-study is reported to be a success:  During baseline, when the contingent-aversive component was absent, small and unstable reductions were observed in the large amount of inappropriate behaviors, and similar small and unstable increases were observed in appropriate baheviors such as play and language. These changes were insufficient to allow for the subjects' successful mainstreaming. Introduction of contingent aversives resulted in a sudden and stable reduction in the inappropriate behaviors and a sudden and stable increase in appropriate behaviors.  (p7) Dr Lovaas concludes, about contingent aversives, that  ...at least one component in the treatment program functioned to produce change, which helps to reduce the effect of placebo variables.  (p7) And, ...the within-subjects study showed that at least one treatment component contributed to the favorable outcome in the intensive treatment (experimental) group.  (p8) And further: In the within-subjects studies that were reported, contingent aversives were isolated as one significant variable. Therefore, it is unlikely that treatment effects could be repeated without this component.  (p8) Two other papers from Dr Lovaas' group from around the same time (Epstein et al., 1985, which reports on 6 of the 19 experimental group children; and Lovaas et al., 1987, which describes part of the study-within-the-study) also refer to the importance of contingent aversives in the study design and findings which were later reported in Lovaas (1987).  The literature leaves no doubt that all 19 autistic children in the experimental group in Lovaas (1987) were subject to contingent aversives. There's also ample evidence that this \"treatment component\" was, in a separate experiment involving 4 experimental and 4 control group children, found then argued to be essential in achieving the famous result in the main experiment in Lovaas (1987). Dr Freeman's misreporting of the literature serves her purpose, in dismissing as \"spurious\" any concerns about aversives. But it also exemplifies the disrespect our most important autism advocates have for peer-reviewed science.  In fact, there's a later ABA intervention study from UCLA in which only four autistic children in an experimental group were subject to contingent aversives, but Dr Freeman does not mention this study or reference it in her book. That's going to be part three. References: Epstein, L.J., Taubman, M.T., and Lovaas, O.I. (1985). Changes in self-stimulatory behaviors with treatment.

{"date": "Saturday, November 11, 2006", "body": "\nHere are some quotes from two recent media stories, from two sets of parents, about their children: First set:    \"I try not to dwell on it ... I try not to look at my kids like they're sick. I know they have a problem but I try not to look at them that way. I try not to treat them any different than any mother treats her children.\" Second set:    \"I started crying and I was just sobbing because I thought there wasn't anything I could do about it... The child you thought you were going to have really dies when you find that out. You've got to become acclimated and accepting of the fact that that person is gone... it was the most devastating thing you could imagine... The public needs to get it that this is a common, expensive and devastating disease that needs the full attention of society.\" Well, it's not hard to spot the second set of parents as having an autistic child. The  media story  is about these parents' \"anguish\". Here's how their devastating autistic child is described: Jon likes activities such as rollerblading, swimming and, most recently, riding his new bike. Jon, who has three older sisters, also loves to read. \"He seems to read better than he talks... It comes easy to him, so we're trying to run with it.\"   The first set of parents don't have autistic children, though at one point, one of their children received an autism diagnosis, which turned out to be incorrect.  Here is how their non-autistic children are described : Five-year-old Jamie and two-and-a-half-year-old Carson have Batten disease, a fatal, inherited nervous system disorder that causes the brain to shrink and shut down over time, eventually robbing its young victims of their speech, sight and motor abilities. There is no known cure or prevention for it... Jamie can't speak, see or move much on her own anymore. She has to be fed through a tube and carried wherever she needs to go. Although still sighted and mobile, Carson has lost the few words he had picked up, including \"mom.\"  This story  finishes with a short, accurate (so far as I can tell) section of information about Batten's, including that children don't live longer than 8-12 years, 20 at the outside.  In Canada there are autism advocates, including political leaders, who claim there is no worse nightmare for any parent, nothing more devastating, no worse anguish, than to have an autistic child. They also claim that autism is the most severe of all neurological disorders, that is, it is worse than fatal childhood neurological disorders like Batten's. This distortion of reality accurately reflects how they see autistic lives. Jaime and Carson's parents have been through a lot. Their first child died at one month. Their two other children have a fatal condition. The only treatment offered that might prevent them from dying is very experimental, unproven, expensive, and dangerous. Here is the only statement alluding to the care required for these children, neither of whom speaks, one of whom has no self-care abilities at all: Keeping's Aunt Suzy and two home care workers help out with Jamie's and Carson's care. I don't know where the calm, dignity and grace shown by Jamie and Carson's parents comes from, but they provide a perspective that's completely missing from the hysteria surrounding the supposed autism crisis.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/DN-autism_11met.ART0.North.Edition1.3dfdeca.html", "http://www.hamiltonspectator.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=hamilton/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1162770307981&call_pageid=1020420665036&col=1014656511815", "http://www.hamiltonspectator.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=hamilton/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1162770307981&call_pageid=1020420665036&col=1014656511815"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/11/most-devastating-thing.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 08, 2006", "body": "\nIn Sabrina Freeman's well-respected book, \"Science for Sale in the Autism Wars\", she has a section called \"The Classic Aversives Ruse\", wherein she takes on \"the spurious issue of aversives\". Dr Freeman is one of Canada's most important autism advocates. She runs Canada's major FEAT group and was one of the parent petitioners in the Auton case.  Her major point is that aversives are no longer used. They're a relic of the past. This point is frequently made by autism advocates. It was made in the Supreme Court of Canada Auton hearing in 2004, by the Auton parents' lawyer. ABA parents don't want to have anything to do with aversives, which are now ancient history. Everyone knows ABA programs are all positive these days. So aversives are an irrelevant non-issue, and anyone saying otherwise is grossly misguided (at least). This position is partly right. For a while now, aversives have no longer been part of routine ABA-based autism interventions.  On the other hand, the one published study invariably used by autism advocates to argue for the effectiveness of ABA programs is Lovaas (1987). According to this study's author and its design, its famous result, those 9 of 19 indistinguishable kids, is dependent on the use of contingent aversives.  Autism advocates have also used the  Auton trial decision , the  US Surgeon's General's report , and the  New York State Department of Health guidelines  as proof that ABA-based interventions are effective and/or \"medically necessary\". All three of these favourite lobbying tools are heavily dependent on Lovaas (1987) and its follow-up (McEachin et al., 1993). Autism advocates also contend that there are multiple replications of Lovaas (1987). There's no evidence to support this claim, not among the very few existing autism-ABA  controlled trials, but let's say they're actually right about this. Then they continue to highlight and promote an aversive-based study when alternative, non-aversive studies are available.  This seems like odd behaviour for ABA advocates whose position is that aversives are an irrelevant relic of bygone days.  There are other reasons for not forgetting about aversives, which is in any case difficult to do when Dr Lovaas' famous 47% continues to be a staple of ABA parent lobbying efforts. One is that aversives continue to be promoted as a necessary part of ABA programs for some autistics in some circumstances. I'm pretty sure Canada's autism advocates would strongly oppose the practices of the  Judge Rotenberg Centre , where extreme aversives are used, and the JRC is not generally respected or promoted among behaviour analysts. No one should forget about the \"students\" at the JRC and what they have to endure. But nor should it be overlooked that some very respected behaviour analysts continue to promote the necessity of aversives in some cases. For example, Richard Foxx recently authored a book chapter about the \"myth\" of non-aversive treatment for \"severe\" behaviour (aggression, self-injury; Foxx, 2005). Dr Foxx is one of the best known and most respected behaviour analysts in the world. He was also recently an expert witness in support of ABA parents in a  British Columbia legal case . James Mulick, another highly respected behaviour analyst known for his work in autism, recently was an author of a published study using electric shock to treat self-injury. Dr Mulick was an expert witness for the ABA parents in Auton. While those in charge of the JRC may be pariahs in the behaviour analytic and autism advocacy communities, Drs Foxx and Mulick are definitely not.  Another reason not to dismiss any mention of aversives as a \"ruse\" is that we should learn from the past and from the suffering of others. We shouldn't forget how utterly wrong all those important behaviour analysts--Lovaas, Carr, Risley, Baer, Schreibman, Koegel, etc.--were when they were claiming that without aversives, autistics were doomed. We should all remember that Lichstein and Schreibman (1976), in a review of multiple behaviour analytic interventions using electric shock on autistic children, stated that the main side effect of using electric shock was \"positive emotional behavior\". They were saying that electric shock made autistics happy, a claim it is hard to imagine being made about typical children. Serious errors in judgment, extreme lapses in ethics, grossly inaccurate observations, etc., have been made and reported throughout the history of behaviour analytic intervention research and this has hurt autistics. We should all remember that. References: Auton et al. v. AGBC , 2000 BCSC 1142 (CanLII) Foxx, R.M. (2005).

{"date": "Monday, November 06, 2006", "body": "\nCharles-Antoine Blais was murdered in Montreal 10 years ago today. He was six years old. He had been diagnosed autistic when he was five.  He was held down and drowned in his bathtub by his mother, Danielle Blais. She was charged with first degree murder, then this was reduced to manslaughter, to which she pleaded guilty.  Charles-Antoine's murder received a lot of media coverage. Autism society officials from Montreal and elsewhere went all out. They wanted everyone to know how devastating it is to have an autistic child, and how understandable it is that a parent would kill such a child. They said that Danielle Blais' life was a nightmare and that it was wrong to punish her.  Parents of autistic children  showered Ms Blais with letters of support . They raised money for Ms Blais. They held a demonstration to support her and to demand the funding of one specific autism treatment, which was widely claimed to be the only way to prevent more autistic children from being killed by their parents. Carmen Lahaie, President of Montreal's autism society, stated in the media that Charles-Antoine was \"happy now\" that he was dead. The media published many stories about the \"tragedy\" of autism. On the news, it was reported that parents of autistic children wanted Ms Blais to represent them. In court, Ms Lahaie testified in support of Ms Blais. According to the judgment signed by Justice Jean B. Falerdeau, Ms Lahaie ...explained how much of a burden it is for parents to take care of an autistic child... Also, Ms Lahaie ...is willing to hire Accused for 21 hours per week at the foundation of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'autisme, when Accused is released. In his summary of the evidence, Justice Falerdeau wrote about Ms Blais, ...she did not want to leave her son alone or impose on others the burden of taking care of an autistic child. In his review of the jurisprudence, he noted about Ms Blais that she ...could be employed in helping the parents of autistic children. And in his summary of sentencing issues, he wrote: It is clear that the accused does not represent a danger for society; she could work and even help the parents of autistic children. In the summer of 1997, Ms Blais was sentenced not to jail, but to a year in a community residential centre, and she was hired as a representative--a sort of role model--by Montreal's autism society, as promised by Ms Lahaie. When I heard this on the national news, I phoned Ms Lahaie, stunned.  What are you doing , I asked. She said,  you can't understand, our children have ruined our lives . In 2003, I spoke with Justice Falerdeau, and with the two lawyers involved in this case. It was clear that Justice Falerdeau's decision was based on the evidence before him. It was not even considered that having an autistic child was anything less than devastating. It was not even considered that Charles-Antoine was anything but the burden described by the President of Montreal's autism society. Everyone saw Charles-Antoine as a burden. No one questioned this. And in the media, Ms Lahaie implied that he was better off dead--happy, to be murdered. I have thought about the life and death of Charles-Antoine Blais every day since that day he was murdered. I'm ashamed I did not speak out at the time more than I did. I was not used to autism advocacy. I thought, what if they are right? They were in charge, after all, making all the decisions, deciding our future. They were the authorities, the people you have to go to, if you are autistic and need help and information. I didn't know any other autistic people, in 1996 and 1997. It would be many years before I got online and found I wasn't the only one who thought what happened was horribly wrong.  Charles-Antoine Blais would be 16 now, if he had not been seen as a burden and killed. I never found a photo of him, except for one in La Presse of his body being removed from his house, in his city, where his life was devalued and taken away from him. Ten years after he was murdered, autistics are still routinely described as devastating and as burdens, including by our political leaders.

I've just read it again and the same thing that hit me the first time through hit me again.  Andrew, the willing, able, but unemployable autistic young man in this article, is described by his mother Anne Bauer as, Lost when it comes to anything social... Ms Bauer describes in some detail Andrew's apparently profound social deficit: He's also one of the most acute, sensitive young men I've ever known.  Above all, he's eerily, compulsively responsible. I was a single mother for five years, and when I left the house, I put him in charge. I would come back to a spotless kitchen and a pile of laundered and folded clothes on my bed. ...the manager offered Andrew a cup of coffee and my son - ever conscious of the rules - insisted on paying for it... He was unfailingly patient and kind.  Now let's look at the social abilities of some of the other people in this article: Target administers a computerized psychological screening test designed to eliminate people on the outer edges of the bell curve. People like Andrew. ... he was turned down, the volunteer coordinator told me, because the hiring manager thought him odd. One screener there was uncomfortable with my son: She had called him - he apologized before saying the words - \"a potential liability.\" So Andrew is acute, sensitive, considerate, responsible, courteous, reliable, and unfailingly patient and kind. But he is also described as being lost when it comes to anything social. Then there are some other people in this article. They're busy \"eliminating\" from employment anyone suspected of being atypical. They're refusing to consider a competent person for a job because he is \"odd\". They're writing off a fully qualified applicant as \"a potential liability\" because he is disabled. But no one comments on how totally lost these other people are when it comes to anything social. These other people encounter Andrew and fail to see him as human, fail to see his remarkable and glaringly evident abilities, and fail to put themselves in his shoes. They flunk theory of mind and empathy with flying colours, displaying what would--if they were autistic--be considered a profound social deficit. Never mind that some of these other people are so anti-social that they appear to be breaking the law--that's another issue. This reminds me of Autism Society Canada, which spent a lot of time  informing the Canadian public  (including employers), as well as governments, that autistics are a \"lifetime liability\", with a dollar figure attached to tell everyone just how big a \"lifetime liability\" we are. ASC's certainty that autistics are a \"lifetime liability\" was repeated  many times over  in ASC's application to intervene in the Auton Supreme Court of Canada hearings. Yet ASC, an organization overwhelmingly by and for non-autistics, would be the first to underline the poor social abilities of autistics, and to declare that autism is characterized by a profound social deficit.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=526862", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2006/11/stand-up-and-fight.html", "http://www.autismvox.com/autistics-need-not-apply/", "http://web.archive.org/web/20040404134514/autismsocietycanada.ca/en/press_releases.html", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_one.html"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/11/profound-social-deficit.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 01, 2006", "body": "\nThe wrath of autism advocates has never been more impressive  than in the aftermath of the 2004 Auton Supreme Court of Canada decision . But one thing the SCC did  not  do was deny that ABA was \"medically necessary\" autism treatment. Their decision was instead primarily based on whether all medically necessary services for everyone in Canada are government funded. Then there's the 2005 Wynberg trial decision, arising from an Ontario battle over the funding of ABA/IBI. This decision includes numerous descriptions of ABA-based autism interventions, all from recognized experts. Here's one expert description of ABA: Dr. Luce described it as a methodology which incorporated the \u201csystematic introduction of educational strategies to determine whether that educational strategy is effective or not\u201d. Here's another one: Dr. Newman described it as a \u201cgeneral theory of education and learning\u201d. And another one: Dr. Leaf referred to ABA as a \u201cteaching strategy\u201d and a \u201cteaching methodology\u201d and said that it was \u201cnot a treatment modality, it\u2019s an instructional framework\u201d And another one: Dr. Handleman, an expert in education, said that ABA was an education for children with autism, not a treatment. Another expert witness, George Niemann, was asked whether ABA was education or treatment. He responded: ...we employ a non-medical model, Your Honour... This looks like a conspiracy to deprive autistic children of \"medically necessary\" autism treatment. Or maybe not. Stephen Luce, Bobby Newman, Ron Leaf, and Jan Handleman are all famous behaviour analysts. Dr Luce co-edited one of the major ABA manuals with Catherine Maurice and Gina Green. Dr Newman was but recently the President of the Association for Science in Autism Treatment. Ron Leaf is a big international ABA service provider and co-wrote another of the major ABA manuals. Jan Handleman is well known as an important behaviour analyst. And all these expert behaviour analysts were testifying for the ABA parents in Wynberg. I don't know who George Neimann is, but he too was testifying as an expert for the plaintiffs--for the ABA parents. In other words, the experts quoted above were all on the side of Canada's autism advocates. Their testimony about the nature of ABA-based autism interventions was indistintuishable from the testimony of the Ontario government side experts in this regard. E.g., Dr. Dunlap described ABA as \u201cthe systematic application of procedures that are based on learning theory and principles of operant learning to produce change of importance in human behaviour\u201d. And: Dr. Siegel and Dr. Perry also agreed that IBI is not considered a medical intervention but a psychological or educational intervention. It was unanimous: ABA is an educational methodology. It is not medical, or medical treatment, or \"medically necessary\" treatment. All the experts--most of whom are respected behaviour analysts--agreed. The trial judge in Wynberg, in her decision, refers to \"early in the trial\", when \"medically necessary\" ABA was \"still a live issue\". By the end of the trial, this issue had long been declared dead. The Wynberg trial decision, unlike the Auton SCC decision, denies that ABA is \"medically necessary\" autism treatment. And Canada's autism advocates were ... delighted. They overwhelmingly celebrated the Wynberg trial decision and organized major demonstrations in Ontario to protest against its appeal. In a victory for the Ontario government, the Wynberg trial decision was recently overturned on appeal, but this may in turn be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Would Canada's autism advocates celebrate if the SCC overturned the Wynberg appeal decision? This could restore the Wynberg trial decision. But if the SCC were to restore this decision, the SCC would be denying that ABA is \"medically necessary\" autism treatment, something they failed to do in Auton.

Here's Simon Baron-Cohen: It is known that children with autism have  superior  detection of detailed features in visual search tasks (O'Riordan, Plaisted, Driver, & Baron-Cohen, 2001). This can be seen as a talent, rather than a deficit. Experimentalists such as Plaisted at times see this as \"enhanced discrimination\" (Plaisted, O'Riordan, & Baron-Cohen, 1998) and at other times as \"reduced generalization\" (Plaisted, 2001). This illustrates that the very same data can be seen from opposite perspectives. \"Superior discrimination of difference\" highlights that although perception is abnormal in autism, it may not be arising because of damage or disorder in a perceptual mechanism, but because that mechanism is more finely tuned, functioning at a  higher  level. \"Reduced discrimination of generality\" may be a consequence of superior dicrimination of difference, but why highlight it? If the person's attentional system is tuned to notice how things differ, then of course they are going to detect differences more than controls do, and report similarity less than controls do. Focussing on the \"reduced discrimination of similarity\" gives the impression that the person has a deficit in a mechanism that detects similarity, essentially putting a negative spin on what is really a talent. It's like saying that someone who can tell you the names of 20 types of beetle has a deficit in saying they are all the same. To you and me they are all just beetles. To the careful observer, they are each unique. From:  Baron-Cohen, S. (2005). Enhanced attention to detail and hyper-systemizing in autism. Commentary on Milne, E., Swettenham, J., & Campbell, R.

{"date": "Saturday, November 04, 2006", "body": "\nAccording to the  Auton trial decision , one of the major ways critics of ABA-based interventions have screwed up is by using the word \"cure\": First, it is said, incorrectly, that Lovaas and his followers purport to claim that Lovaas Autism Treatment \u201ccures\u201d autism. In fact, neither Lovaas nor those who support him have ever claimed that Lovaas therapy \u201ccures\u201d autism.  So is Madame Justice Allen, the trial judge in Auton, correct? From her own decision, 36 paragraphs after the statement above, here is Justice Allen again: Providing a number of supportive services to a disorder that with treatment we know that half could recover, is tantamount to withholding treatment and continuing with support and respite services for AIDS patients after a treatment that can cure half of them has been discovered. In fact, this is Justice Allen quoting directly from the British Columbia behaviour analyst Glen Davies. Dr Davies (who is not an MD) was an expert witness for the ABA parents in Auton, and is undoubtedly an enthusiastic supporter of Ivar Lovaas. This reads like a claim of cure to me, with the added kick of equating autism with a fatal disease. How about Dr Lovaas himself? From Lovaas and Smith (1989):  Intensive behavioral interventions may act to reverse whatever neurological difficulties are involved in autistic children's problems. If so, they may come close to providing a \"cure\" for the problems. This is a speculative and qualified statement, and it reflects the behaviour analytic view of autism as a series of behavioural \"problems\". But if Drs Lovaas and Smith had not intended to claim to some degree that ABA-based intensive interventions may \"cure\" autism, they would have used a different word.  In  a similar context , Dr Lovaas also used the word \"cure\" in 1974, in making speculative claims about an apparently successful early ABA-based intensive intervention. From Rekers, Lovaas, and Low (1974): Only followup data will allow us to claim a cure for (or prevention of) the severe adult sexual pathologies of transvestism and transsexualism or some forms of homosexuality. So while Dr Lovaas and his \"followers\" don't routinely claim that ABA-based interventions can \"cure\" autism or other conditions they have equally assumed to be \"severe\" pathologies, it's inaccurate to state that no claims of \"cure\" have been made at all.

A previous health minister once responded to a letter of mine by sending me his  pity, as well as concerns about the plight of my poor family  . So my expectations are low. Sir, I've read your  Autism Awareness Month message . You call autism a \"disease\" and praise all the dedicated people involved in \"the fight against autism spectrum disorder\". This sends a powerful message to all Canadians, that autism is a very bad thing that ideally Canada should be free of. This message goes out to schools, communities and employers, all of whom are informed that autism is an unwanted disease to fight against. Employers, for example, would see a potential employee who is autistic as sick or diseased, rather than as having an atypical pattern of strengths and weaknesses which is remarkably and productively complementary to the typical pattern.  Canada has always had autistic people. Indeed, the figure of 200,000 autistics in Canada that you provide assumes the same consensual (in the peer-reviewed science) prevalence of 60/10,000 across all age cohorts--going back generations. Now you and your government are saying that autistic neurology is a disease to fight against, and that ideally, the contributions to Canadian society made by autistic people over the generations will stop. Mr Clement, your Canada seems to have room for only one kind of neurology, and only one pattern of strengths and weaknesses, and only one acceptable range of traits and abilities. You've placed autistics outside of these acceptable parameters, by calling us diseased, and by praising those who fight against autistic differences in an effort to remove them from society altogether.  You have nothing good to say about those who are working to ensure that autistics receive the assistance, acceptance, and respect we need in order to succeed in society as autistic people. In short, you and your government seem to want a society where only non-autistic traits and abilities are valued and \"healthy\", while autistic traits and abilities are considered unwanted--something to fight against--and diseased. I would like to know why. Thank you for your time.

{"date": "Monday, October 30, 2006", "body": "\nIt's a basic tenet of Canada's autism advocates that autistics just naturally belong in institutions, and can only stay out of institutions by undergoing \"medically necessary\" ABA starting very early in life. From the autism advocate  \"fact sheet\"  again, the one disseminated to all of Canada's political leaders, Without treatment, autism is a lifelong affliction that results in 90% of afflicted individuals placed in institutions and residential facilities, facing an unfulfilling and bleak existence for both the individual and family members. This has clearly caught on. Here is  Senator Jim Munson, speaking about autistics in the Senate on May 11, 2006 : However, honourable senators, we need to act. Nine out of 10 children who do not receive the treatment they need are institutionalized. The 90% institutionalization rate (even higher rates have been promoted) is a reflection of the values and goals of autism advocates and has no foundation in the existing science. It's a complete fabrication that I wrote about from many different angles  here . I would challenge autism advocates to give me one reference (a primary source from peer-reviewed science, please) that supports this fictional figure, in any era, much less the current one.  But what happens to autistic children who, as autism advocates demand, undergo \"medically necessary\" ABA from an early age? Michael Lewis is a Director of Autism Society Canada and the President of Autism Society British Columbia. He has been involved in ABA litigation and is one of our leading autism advocates and promoters of \"medically necessary\" ABA for all autistics. His son was diagnosed autistic at age 3. From a  2005 media story , here's a description of Mr Lewis' son: Now in grade five in a regular classroom, the boy is a busy 11-year-old. He bikes, skis, swims and even plays clarinet in his school orchestra. He's also, \"an active participant in family life,\" says Mr Lewis, who also serves as the President of the Autism Society of British Columbia. \"Whatever we do, he's part of it.\" Mr Lewis credits all of this to his son's ABA program. However... But if his son's treatment was stopped, Mr Lewis is convinced the child would need to be institutionalized, possibly immediately. \"If not now, then shortly,\" he says.   So Mr Lewis' son has undergone \"medically necessary\" ABA for many years, and has, according to his father, acquired a lot of impressive skills in this program. But the moment this ABA program stops, Mr Lewis promises to put his son in an institution. The impressive skills don't seem to belong to the boy, but to the \"medically necessary\" ABA program on which he is totally dependent, and without which the impressive skills instantly vanish and he is instantly doomed. He goes straight from a regular classroom to a bleak existence (as they say) in an institution, immediately or shortly after his ABA program stops.  This seems to cast some doubt on the effectiveness of \"medically necessary\" ABA, but Mr Lewis has no such doubts. Instead, there's that certainty that autistics  belong not in families or society but in institutions. Even autistics who are considered to have succeeded in ABA programs, who stay in them for years, aren't safe. The only way to be safe is to be normal. Or else.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://featbc.org/downloads/AutismInCanadaflyer.pdf", "http://www.parl.gc.ca/39/1/parlbus/chambus/senate/deb-e/013db_2006-05-11-E.htm?Language=E&Parl=39&Ses=1#47", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_vic.html#c", "http://www.nationalreviewofmedicine.com/issue/2005/04_15/2_feature05_07.html"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/10/instant-institutionalization.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Monday, October 30, 2006", "body": "\nIt was an historic occasion.  Andy Scott's   motion  to create a National Autism Strategy for Canada was debated in the House of Commons last Friday, October 27. A record of this debate is  here . It's a tribute to \"autism advocacy\" that all of Canada's political parties are determined to legislate an autistic-free Canada, the sooner the better. In fact, you can see the success of \"autism advocacy\" all over this historic debate, something I may try to get back to later.  For now, I'll concentrate on one of the greatest triumphs of Canada's leading \"autism advocates\". Here's Liberal MP Ruby Dhalla, taking her turn in the House of Commons' historic autism debate: \"Autism spectrum disorder is currently reaching epidemic levels. If we look 10 years back, statistics show that almost one in every 10,000 children was diagnosed with autism. However, in 2006 the statistics are quite shocking. One in 166 children is diagnosed with autism.\" In other words, according to Ms Dhalla, there are very few autistics over the age of 10 in Canada. In fact, there would be only ~3,000 in the entire country. There would be less than 500 autistic children between the ages of 10 and 20, and not much more than 2,500 autistic adults, in the entire country.  Ms Dhalla is also saying that there are only ~25,000 autistics, of any age, in the entire country. And this very low approximate figure only applies if the prevalence of autism leaped from 1/10,000 to 60/10,000 (that's 1/166) overnight, about ten years ago. If Ms Dhalla is proposing a more gradual increase over the past ten years, then this would mean considerably fewer than 25,000 autistics in Canada. Ms Dhalla is correct about the current-day consensual prevalence figure for the spectrum. But where does her figure of 1/10,000 for 10 years ago come from?  Eric Fombonne's Montreal data give an across-spectrum prevalence of 67/10,000 for children born 10 years ago, in 1996 (Fombonne et al. 2006). The two Baird et al. (2000, 2006) studies involved children born in 1990-1991, or at least 15 years ago; prevalence across the spectrum ranged from ~60/10,000 to ~100/10,000 (with the 2nd, very high figure being due to the ascertainment and diagnosis of high levels of secondary PDD-NOS). Chakrabarti & Fombonne (2001, 2005) found a high, stable prevalence across the spectrum of ~60/10,000 in children born between 1992 and 1998--that is, between 14 and 8 years ago. Honda et al. (1996) found a prevalence of the specific diagnosis of autism of ~21/10,000 in children born in 1988, 18 years ago; working from the cumulative incidence figure for that birth year (Honda et al., 2005), it would appear (I would stand to be corrected on this) that the across-spectrum prevalence would fall within the 60/10,000 range also. And so on. Ms Dhalla's 1/10,000 figure doesn't appear to come from the science, any more than her declaration of a \"quite shocking\" autism epidemic. It seems more than likely that Ms Dhalla got her data from this  \"fact sheet\"  produced by two of Canada's leading \"autism advocates\", Brenda Deskin and Andrew Kavchak. This \"fact sheet\" has been widely distributed among Canada's political leaders, and is posted and promoted by Canada's most influential and politically active FEAT group. Ms Dhalla's contribution to the historic autism debate shows how seriously this \"fact sheet\" has been taken. Canada has brand new 2006 census figures, so it's easy to compare the science (a high, stable rate of autism) to Ms Dhalla's \"quite shocking\" epidemic, the epidemic forcefully promoted by our most important \"autism advocates\": The science says there are ~197,000 autistics in Canada in 2006. Ms Dhalla and our \"autism advocates\" say there are ~25,000 or less. The science says there are ~26,000 autistic children from ages 10-19. Ms Dhalla and our \"autism advocates\" say there are less than 500. The science says there are ~150,000 autistic adults in Canada. Ms Dhalla and our \"autism advocates\" say there are not much more than 2,500.  One of the major accomplishments of \"autism advocacy\" in Canada has been the denial of autistic lives. By anti-scientifically promoting an \"epidemic\" of autism, those who claim to represent all autistics in Canada are telling our leaders that the vast majority of autistics in Canada don't even exist. We aren't here and we were never here and we will never be here: we have no past, present, or future. Tens of thousands of autistic lives have been denied--stamped out, abolished, gone. \"Autism advocates\" are lobbying against assistance or accommodation for most autistics in Canada, by insisting that our lives are non-existent.  This erasing of autistic lives has clearly caught on among Canada's political leaders. These leaders can use the anti-scientific views of autism pushed by \"autism advocates\" to deny the obligation of governments to accommodate, assist, or even acknowledge the existence of most autistics in Canada. Ms Dhalla's goal is an autistic-free Canada: she states directly that autism should be prevented. While waiting for this goal to be legislated and achieved, she has done an outstanding job of using anti-science to deny the lives of most autistic Canadians. That noise you hear is the sound of our celebrated \"autism advocates\", applauding as loudly as they can.

{"date": "Saturday, October 28, 2006", "body": "\nAndy Scott, a Liberal MP from New Brunswick, is pushing a National Autism Strategy for Canada. Like all our eminent \"autism advocates\", he's so busy trying to save Canada from the alarming affliction of autism that he has no time to bother with science, ethics, or basic human decency. This is a  letter  Mr Scott's office received on October 19, 2006. I've added references at the end. Sir, I've been alerted to a letter you've written to other MPs, which I found  here . You make no mention that you consulted with any autistic people before making your decisions about our future. Also, I'm very disappointed to see, yet again, important political leaders spreading false, anti-scientific information about autistic people, as well as characterizing us in inappropriate and offensive ways. For example, the Canadian Down Syndrome Society states directly that it is inappropriate and offensive to refer to people with DS as \"afflicted with\" or \"suffering from\" DS. Sir, I hope you will see fit to give the same consideration to Canadians who are autistic. With respect to the science, there is a wide consensus in the peer-reviewed literature that there is no evidence for an \"alarming\" increase in the prevalence of autism (a few of the many possible references include Fombonne, 2001, 2003; Wing & Potter, 2002; Rutter, 2005; Barbaresi et al., 2005; Fombonne et al, 2006; Gernsbacher et al., 2005). There is instead evidence for a high, stable rate of autism (Chakrabarti & Fombonne, 2001, 2005). If you have been provided with different information, then you should regard these sources of information as non-credible. Canada is fortunate to be home to the most respected autism epidemiologist in the world, Eric Fombonne at McGill (he is also a Canada Research Chair). It's very disappointing that neither you nor your staff made the effort read the science or consult with renowned Canadian experts before spreading alarm about the existence of autistic people. Using a current 1 in 166 figure (this is a consensual prevalence figure, not an incidence figure), but declaring that this represents an \"alarming\" increase in autism, both denies and stigmatizes the existence of autistics. You are denying the high, stable rate of autism which has been empirically documented. You are distorting the true picture of autism in Canada. Pushing an \"autism epidemic\" is a popular practice designed to spread fear and dread of autistic people as well as a sense of crisis, but it is anti-scientific and unethical. I do not understand why you are promoting an anti-scientific view of autism, sir, or why you believe this will help autistic people in Canada. The ABA-based autism interventions which you are promoting are supported by a scientific literature which is enormous in quantity but very poor in quality. In 45 years of research in this field, there is only one randomized controlled trial (the standard of research applied to non-autistics) of ABA-based early intensive interventions for autism, and this study was a failure (Smith, Groen & Wynn, 2000). There are also very few multi-year non-randomized controlled trials of this kind of intervention. Only one showed good outcomes for a large minority of autistics, and this study (reported in 2 papers: Lovaas, 1987; McEachin, Smith & Lovaas, 1993) was dependent on the use of physical punishment (contingent aversives), which is no longer acceptable practice. One of the better designed non-randomized controlled trials now has a presented 10-year follow-up which shows that the few children who did well in early ABA/IBI did not maintain their gains (Birnbrauer & Leach, 1993, 2006). No other follow up into school ages of a non-aversive ABA program is available. A recent Canadian study (Eaves & Ho, 2004) showed no effect of kind or amount of any currently marketed autism treatment on outcomes in about 40 autistic children in the \"crucial\" 2-5 year range: some of the children did well, others less well, but this was unrelated to the kind or amount of treatment they received. Half these children were in ABA programs. There was no difference between the outcomes of the children who were or weren't in ABA programs. Another recent study (Sallows & Graupner, 2005) shows that neither intensity nor quality of ABA-based early intensive interventions is correlated with outcome measures; in fact, in this study, the control group outperformed the experimental group, and only by lumping the groups together (resulting in an uncontrolled trial) could this study claim a large minority of good outcomes. Indeed, not one controlled trial of ABA/IBI in autism has found a correlation between treatment intensity or overall quantity and outcome measures. In 45 years of research, there has not been one peer-reviewed paper providing data about the adult outcomes of early ABA/IBI programs. Nor has there been a cost-benefit analysis that allows for more than three years of ABA/IBI--a level of service that has been rejected by ABA advocates in Canada, who are now demanding ABA/IBI across the lifespan for autistics. Therefore, your promise that ABA/IBI will save money in the long run has no current factual foundation. The assumption that unless autistics are extensively trained to be or act like non-autistics, then we are doomed to be burdens on society, is possibly becoming more and more true in a society where political leaders inform our communities that we are alarming, debilitated, afflicted, and suffering. But a thorough reading of the science would reveal that many popular assumptions about autistic outcomes are founded in clich\u00e9s and prejudice, not in the available peer-reviewed literature. Also, ABA/IBI is not, as all the experts for both sides in the Wynberg trial agreed, medical or medical treatment in any way. ABA/IBI was not pioneered or developed by medical professionals, nor is it researched or provided by medical professionals. ABA/IBI is about learning and education, which may explain why it is not necessarily funded as medical treatment. Sir, you characterize autistic cognition as \"enormously debilitating\". The most replicated and robust findings in autism research are autistic strengths, strengths which are remarkably complementary to the non-autistic pattern of strengths. These strengths are found across all ages (toddlers to adults) and presumed levels of functioning. You can find a short, incomplete, and now out-of-date list (more strengths have been found and published) of these strengths in my Senate brief  here  (references at the end). As I wrote at the time, autistics can only achieve \"normal functioning\"--the ideal of ABA/IBI programs--by losing our very tenacious strengths, which are a great obstacle to our passing in any way for normal. By using words like \"alarming\", \"afflicted\", \"suffering\" and \"debilitating\" to describe autistic people, you are saying that you see no value in having a variety of abilities in society. Instead, you see autistics as sick, and as needing medical treatment until we become \"healthy\", which means \"non-autistic\". Sir, I disagree, for scientific and ethical reasons. Autistics deserve much higher standards of science, ethics, and advocacy. We do not deserve the very low standards now considered by our leaders, political and otherwise, yourself included, to be good enough for autistics. Autistics should receive the assistance we need in order to succeed in society as autistic people. Your discarding of both science and ethics in order to make popular claims about saving Canadian society (and the Canadian economy) from autism does not help. Your contribution to and encouragement of the irrational and unbalanced nature of the public discourse about autism in Canada does not help. Your promotion of anti-scientific views of autism as what autistics deserve does not help. I realize that autistics have been taught to accept low or no standards in how we are regarded and treated, and to be profusely grateful for this. This is what I've been forcefully and persistently taught myself. I do not think this is a good thing. Autistics have a lot to offer Canada, as autistic people. I am disappointed that you have not seen fit to consider this.

{"date": "Saturday, October 28, 2006", "body": "\nThis is something I wrote that was posted on  jypsy and Alex's iRunman blog : Autism is a neurological difference classified as a developmental disability. Autistic people have atypical behaviours in three areas: social interaction, communication, and restricted interests or repetitive behaviours. Autistics are different at the most basic level available: how we experience the world, and how we learn from it. Autism presents with measurable differences in perception, attention, memory, intelligence, etc. The autistic order and progress of development is different from the typical version as is autistic brain structure, allocation, and function. Autism presents strengths not available to the typical population, but the different pattern of strengths and weaknesses characterizing autism results in many difficulties as atypical needs and adaptive but atypical autistic behaviours are at odds with what is considered or expected as \"normal\". Autism isn't a disease, or a bunch of behaviours, any more than femaleness is. Autism involves neurological differences, which are basic and comprehensive. Autistic neurology is no more or less valid than non-autistic neurology: both autistics and non-autistics are able to develop, learn, progress, and achieve things, but may do so in different ways and may require different kinds of help along the way. Progress is part of the natural course of development in autistics, as it is in non-autistics, but development in autism may not proceed in the same order as is considered normal for non-autistics. Autistics may, e.g., seem advanced in some areas and delayed in others. Seen in perspective, this means that in comparison with autistics, non-autistics are likely to be advanced in some areas and delayed in others. Non-autistics may need a great deal of assistance in learning things that autistics learn easily, and the reverse may also be true. Seeing as we don't declare non-autistics to be \"succeeding in treatment\" or \"less severely non-autistic\" or \"recovered\" when they develop and learn, it should be clear that describing autistics in these kinds of terms is misleading and prejudicial. Autistics are alert and aware of what is happening around us, even though we may not be able to show this or respond in expected, typical ways. Autistics also may not communicate in typical ways, and in some situations, will find it difficult to communicate at all. However, this does not reflect a fundamental inability or unwillingness to communicate. Autistics want to communicate, and can do so when provided with a context in which communication is both possible and responded to. This is also true of non-autistics, but non-autistics are much more likely to be provided with contexts in which they can communicate successfully. Dividing autism into \"severe\" and \"mild\", or in similar ways, is misleading and harmful. Autistics may differ in the extent to which autistic traits are or are not obvious, and this may vary in individual autistics from hour to hour, day to day, and year to year, depending on many factors, including on what kind of context an autistic lives in. The extent to which autistic traits are or are not evident in any individual autistic is unrelated to our intelligence and our outcomes as adults. However, societal prejudices against autistic traits may prevent autistics whose traits are more obvious from being considered able to learn, to communicate, to make decisions about our lives, to walk around freely, to be employed, etc.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://irunman.blogspot.com/2006/09/our-handouts-info-we-gave-all-who.html"], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/10/whats-autism-anyway.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, October 28, 2006", "body": "\nIt's not hard to create a crisis. You can start by spreading a lot of false information about an identifiable group of people. You could, e.g., call them diseased and tell everyone that because of their disease, these people can't communicate, so no one should listen to them. Then you're free to spread fear and dread of these people, including by claiming that their numbers are exploding. This is great way to create a scary, urgent crisis demanding attention and money in the face of impending doom (for families, for society, for the economy, for the world as we know it, etc). This kind of crisis creation has been the primary activity of \"autism advocacy\", which is the widespread effort to make the world as free of autism--of autistic people--as possible. Two Octobers in a row, Autism Society Canada has declared a \"growing autism crisis\". This is their Canadian Autism Awareness Month campaign to make sure all Canadians know that autism is scary. Autism is so scary, according to ASC, that it must become a reportable disease--a status reserved for infectious and deadly diseases in Canada. But as ASC themselves have noted two years running, there hasn't been any increase in the prevalence of autism going back generations. ASC gives the figure of ~200,000 autistics in Canada. This means a steady prevalence of ~60/10,000 which has not changed, going back at least a full lifespan. There is no higher prevalence of autism now than there was 30 or 70 years ago, according to the figures in ASC's recent press releases. Whatever is causing ASC's scary and growing crisis, it isn't autism itself. I'm possibly the world's slowest and most laborious writer, but when I can, I'll be writing here about the science and ethics of autism advocacy, and also about its consequences. If we're having an autism crisis, as autism advocates in Canada and elsewhere insist, what exactly is this crisis anyway, and who caused it?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2006/10/what-crisis_28.html", "title": "\n"}
