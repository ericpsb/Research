It\u2019s his last time with his beloved therapist Miss R.\u00a0 She\u2019s been with him \u2013 with all of us \u2013 since November of Howie\u2019s kindergarten year almost four years ago.\u00a0 She started the week when everything fell apart for Howie at school.\u00a0 The week when I looked around the table and said \u201cwe\u2019ve all failed him here\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll log on first and then you join my world.\u00a0 I\u2019ll show you.\u201d Miss R gave her notice two weeks ago.\u00a0 Howie didn\u2019t react well to the news when I told him over the weekend.\u00a0 He got very quiet, asked who his new teacher would be, and then walked away from me to sit with the dog. \u201cOkay.\u00a0 Now join.\u00a0 I see you!\u00a0 Do you see me? Hi there Newbie3495!\u201d I listened to them as they talked back and forth about Howie\u2019s Minecraft world. He had created the account for her a few weeks ago so they could play together at the end of their sessions.\u00a0 Howie took her step by step through all the iPad controls, and taught her how to move, how to dig, and how to place blocks. \u201cWait!\u00a0 Did you fall into a hole? Let me help you out. Okay.\u00a0 Come closer to me and I can help you find an emerald.\u201d I sat on the floor in the other room playing tug of war with the dog and his rope, and I tried not to cry. ********** From my thank you note to Miss R: \n Dear R, \n There\u2019s not enough thank you card space to express what you\u2019ve done for Howie and all of us these four years. \n Thank you for helping him when he would only eat four things. Now he eats Thai Hot Pots and tacos from Chipotle. \n Thank you for taking his \u201centhusiasms\u201d and working with him, not against him.\u00a0 Thank you for drawing parts of Hot Wheels cars every time he took a bite of food so he would eat. Thank you for encouraging his invention sketches as part of his homework. Thank you for using and playing Minecraft to work on his conversation skills.\u00a0 You never once disparaged them as \u201cobsessions\u201d to ignore and replace, but rather as a tool for connecting with him. \n Thank you for working with Howie when he couldn\u2019t sit for one minute to do his homework.\u00a0 Now he completes the worksheets in five minutes. \n Thank you for scribing sentences and for working through third grade word problems with him. \n Thank you for playing games with Howie when losing for him was so hard.\u00a0 Now he says \u201cgood game\u201d and moves on. \n Thank you for teaching him how to swing on the swings.\u00a0 And thank you for all the \u201cunderdogs\u201d. \n Thank you for waiting him out when he needed space.\u00a0 And for knowing when he was all done. \n Thank you for coming school shopping with us.\u00a0 And to restaurants. And the park.\u00a0 And the sensory gym. \n Thank you for implementing a \u201cHowie\u201d program and not an \u201cautism\u201d program. \n Thank you for being there when  our dog Rocko  died.\u00a0 And now when the new dog Newton came home. \n Thank you for building a trust with Howie. And with us. \n Thank you for believing in him.\u00a0 Thank you for calling him a hero and helping him show the world what he can do. \n You will be missed. \n ********* At five o\u2019clock, Miss R turned to Howie, handed him back the iPad, and said it was time for her go.\u00a0 I called him over and handed him her goodbye gift to give to her. \u201cIt\u2019s your favorite.\u00a0 A coffee mug with the Patriots sign on it.\u201d Then he hugged her. \u201cYou\u2019ve come so far, buddy,\u201d R said. \u201cI will miss you.\u201d \u201cI will miss you too.\u201d And I cried. ********** This morning before school, Howie looked up at the white board that I use daily to tell the kids their schedule for the day. \u201cIt\u2019s Wednesday.\u00a0 No more Miss R on Wednesdays.\u201d  Howie said quietly. \u201cNo. Not anymore,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cBut maybe I can play Minecraft this afternoon with you instead?\u201d \u201cOkay. Just try not to fall into any holes. But I\u2019ll get you out if you do.\u201d \u201c There\u2019s a sad sort of clanging \n From the clock in the hall \n And the bells in the steeple, too \n And up in the nursery \n An absurd little bird \n Is popping out to say coo-coo \n (Coo-coo, coo-coo) coo-coo Regretfully they tell us  \n coo-coo But firmly they compel us \n to say good bye \n coo-coo  \n (All)  \n To you So long, farewell \n Auf Wiedersehen, goodnight \n I hate to go and leave this pretty sight\u201d \u2013  So Long, Farewell from The Sound of Mu sic \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/image11.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/rockos-modern-life/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/image21.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/so-long-farewell/", "title": "\n\t\t\tSo Long, Farewell\t\t"},
{"date": "January 18, 2010", "body": "(originally published on the Autism Speaks website) \u201cIs your son on the spectrum?\u201d The question was slightly jarring to me. My son and I had just walked into a gymnastics class for kids with autism. We had received his diagnosis only three weeks before, and we hadn\u2019t shared our news with anyone except for close friends and family. It was the first time we had been anywhere that was just for kids like mine and I wasn\u2019t really ready to talk to a total stranger about it. \n \u201cYes,\u201d I answered, trying to keep the conversation short. \n \u201cHi, and welcome! That\u2019s my son over there, and my name is Sandy. How old is your son? Do you live in town? How long have you known your son was on the spectrum? What was his diagnosis?\u201d \n I really didn\u2019t want to answer her. I wasn\u2019t even sure we belonged at this class, and all I wanted to do was pay attention to my son to see how he was responding to the class. I watched the other kids as they came in \u2013 six boys and one girl \u2013 and my first instinct was that we were in the wrong place. One little boy was crying, another was spinning in circles, and another one was running in all different directions. My son\u2018s not like that, I thought to myself.  This isn\u2019t us. \n And then I looked at my Howie. I watched him hold tightly to his one-on-one helper\u2019s hand as they walked on a low balance beam, but he wouldn\u2019t look her in the eye when she talked to him. I watched him try to run away to jump into the comfort of the sensory foam blocks and become so focused on that foam pit that he couldn\u2019t move onto anything else. I listened to him babble while he swayed back and forth on the rings, and saw the terror in his face when the noise level got up too high. The tears welled up in my eyes. We  did  belong here. This is the right place for him. We had found a safe place for him to exercise and develop his muscles in an environment that understood his special needs. For so long we had avoided the \u201cregular\u201d gym classes, music classes, and playgroups because of his behavior. No one here was giving me the usual disapproving looks we get when we\u2019re out places and Howie starts to act up. \n I took a deep breath and turned to the mom. \n \u201cHi! My son Howie was diagnosed with PDD-NOS a few weeks ago. We do live in town. In fact, I\u2019ve seen your son at the preschool that my son attends. How long has your son attended classes here?\u201d \n It took everything I had to have that conversation, but it was such a relief. This other mom was reaching out to make a connection \u2013 to find someone else who struggles on a daily basis like she does \u2013 something I myself had been desperate to do for weeks and months. I was instantly welcomed into a community of people who \u201cget it.\u201d No one batted an eye when Howie buried himself under the foam blocks at the end of class so he didn\u2019t have to leave. I got comforting looks of understanding from all the parents and teachers when he had a major meltdown leaving the gym, and big thumbs up from everyone when we finally got our shoes on and went out the door. These were moms and dads who shared my daily difficulties of just getting out of the house. Finally we were somewhere that felt like we belonged. \n \u201cWill we see you next week?\u201d asked the mom. \n \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I replied. \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/01/18/welcome-to-the-community/", "title": "\n\t\t\tWelcome\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0Community\t\t"},
{"date": "May 27, 2014", "body": "\u00a0 \u201cThe things that make me different are the things that make me ME!\u201d \u2013 Piglet quote on the wall of our  sensory gym Last week I got an email from one of Howie\u2019s teachers.\u00a0 She explained that they had been working on a math assessment test about money and coins.\u00a0 The directions were to count the money and show your work.\u00a0 The teacher said that Howie had refused to show his work. His explanation was that he didn\u2019t have to \u201cbecause I have autism.\u201d She wrote that they had worked through the refusal by reminding him that this was for his third grade teachers and while she knew he could do it in his head, he needed to show his new teachers that he understood the work. Now Howie has never been a big fan of reviewing concepts.\u00a0 \u201cI already know how to do this!\u201d is a frequent refrain when doing assessments or review work.\u00a0 But this was a new wrinkle.\u00a0 He had never refused to do work because of autism before. I wrote back and said I was kind of stunned by all of this since we\u2019ve never said anything like that to him or around him before.\u00a0 We\u2019ve always talked about autism \u2013 and specifically his autism \u2013 in a positive light.\u00a0  Talking about the gifts it brings him .\u00a0 Lately we had been discussing how there are times when different brains have a harder time with some activities, and that\u2019s why sometimes he needed to leave the room to take a test, or use his headphones or have a sensory break.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve never said he couldn\u2019t do\u2026anything. I expressed my surprise at his statement and said I would talk with him about it. Later that afternoon, Howie and I were sitting across from each other on the floor of our living room.\u00a0 His iPad was on his lap and he was creating his newest world on his Blocksworld app. \u201cHey bud'\u201d I said. \u201d I heard that you had some trouble working on your math assessment today?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u00a0 But the fruit snacks helped me get through it.\u201d \u201cWhat was hard?\u201d \u201cI had to write it all out but I knew the answer.\u201d \u201cYour teacher said you told her that you couldn\u2019t do the test because you had autism?\u201d \u201d I said I didn\u2019t have to do the work because I had autism,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t look up at all. \u201cWell, autism isn\u2019t an excuse you know,\u201d I said. \u201d You can do hard things. But you still need to do the work.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say I  couldn\u2019t, \u201d he said . \u00a0 \u201cI said I  didn\u2019t have to. \u00a0 I didn\u2019t have to show my work. I could see it and do it in my head.\u201d I sat there and just looked at him.\u00a0 His eyes never left the iPad, fingers moving and swiping and tapping as he built a cityscape for his Blocksworld cars to drive through. Not an excuse. A reason . Not a negative.\u00a0 A positive.  Not can\u2019t do. Don\u2019t have to to understand. Part of his gift.\u00a0 He could see it in his head. So why do the extra work? He wasn\u2019t trying to get out of doing the test itself.\u00a0 Just the showing his work.\u00a0 And not because he didn\u2019t want to. Because  \u201c I didn\u2019t have to . \u201d He was actually advocating for himself. \u201cI understand now,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cBut you know there will be times when you have to show your work, even when you can do it in your head.\u00a0 It\u2019s important for other people to see what you see.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201d And the fruit snacks were really good.\u201d *********** In our world, autism isn\u2019t and won\u2019t be an excuse.\u00a0 We\u2019re never going to teach him he  can\u2019t  do something because of how his brain is wired. But it can be a reason why things are hard. Or, in this case, easy. Maybe it\u2019s semantics. This is why we felt it was important that Howie knows and understands his diagnosis. So he could say, \u201cI see this differently because my brain is wired differently.\u201d A few weeks ago, M. Kelter of  Invisible Strings  posted this on his Facebook page: Without the words to say \u201cbecause of my autism\u201d, how might this interaction have gone? Alternative scenarios might have involved a long, drawn out stand off, viewed as noncompliance, leaving everyone exhausted, frustrated and miserable. Leaving my kid feeling like a bad kid.\u00a0 A failure.\u00a0 Different without explanation as to how or why. Removed for long periods of time from his general education classroom as things escalated, keeping him away from his peers. He knows he leaves to take tests in a quiet space so he doesn\u2019t get distracted.\u00a0 We are working on helping him understand that his aide is there as a \u201ccoach\u201d and \u201cinterpreter\u201d when he needs help. But he also needs to know that we will listen to what he is really saying and doing and go beyond the specific words that he is using\u00a0 in order to make sure that we understand their meaning.\u00a0 Because here he was, in his way, appropriately advocating for himself. It\u2019s our job to make sure we hear him when he does. \u201cThe things that make me different are the things that make me ME!\u201d \u00a0 \u201c Although you see the world different than me \n  Sometimes I can touch upon the wonders that you see \n  All the new colors and pictures you\u2019ve designed \n  Oh yes, sweet darling \n  So glad you are a child of mine.

{"date": "June 23, 2010", "body": "(or more appropriately, going to the golf course) My mother is getting married this weekend.\u00a0 We are all very excited for her \u2013 she has met a wonderful guy and lightning really seems to have struck twice for her.\u00a0 When we heard the news I couldn\u2019t wait to share it with the boys.\u00a0 As I was telling them all about it, who would be there, and when it would be, these words came out of Howie\u2019s mouth: \u201c Mom?\u00a0 Will you keep me safe at Grandma\u2019s wedding? \u201d Gulp. Initially, I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what he meant, and gave a quick \u201cOf course!\u00a0 It\u2019s my job to keep you safe.\u201d and dismissed it at that.\u00a0 My kids have been to many weddings (including their other grandmother \u2013 how many kids can say they\u2019ve been to both grandmothers\u2019 weddings?) so it wasn\u2019t the fear of the unknown. As I found out a bit later, it was the fear of the  known . A few weeks later, we were talking about the wedding again.\u00a0 And again Howie asked me if I would keep him safe.\u00a0 As the wheels began to spin in my head, I asked him what he meant by that.\u00a0 \u201cThe music, Mom.\u00a0 And the noise.\u00a0 Will you keep me in a safe place so I\u2019m not near the noise?\u201d Gulp again. Any excitement I had been feeling about the wedding turn to instant panic.\u00a0 Howie\u2019s sensory processing disorder was about to take over any and all planning for the event.\u00a0 As I mentioned, we had been to several weddings before, including a few loud ones about 2 years ago.\u00a0 We spent most of the reception outside in the mud \u2013 Tim and I couldn\u2019t even drag him into the tent when the music was playing.\u00a0 Finally we gave up, and went back to our room to escape.\u00a0 But that was different.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t have to be part of the festivities.\u00a0 This was my mother\u2019s wedding, and I (we) had to be there. In the past, I would have melted into a total state of anxiety, my head filled with ways that this could go wrong.\u00a0 Instead, I called on my army of supporters \u2013 his teachers from school and his occupational therapists.\u00a0 They know him almost as well as I do.\u00a0 And I asked for help. His incredible teachers and OT sprang into action and helped me form a game plan.\u00a0 First we created a  social story  for him about the wedding weekend.\u00a0 For those of you who don\u2019t know what a social story is, it\u2019s an \u201cintervention attempt to improve the social skills of children with spectrum disorders by using individualized short stories to help them interpret challenging or confusing social situations. The stories have a specifically defined style and format.   They describe a situation in terms of relevant social cues, the perspective of others, and often suggest an appropriate response.\u201d ( thank you Wikipedia )\u00a0 It\u2019s a way of using pictures and words to help prepare the kids for what is coming, so that transitions are easier and the routine is predictable. His teacher used pictures of our family to describe each day what was going to happen \u2013 from the day we leave until the day we come home.\u00a0 She used a format that was familiar to Howie from school so he understood it completely.\u00a0 She wrote places where he might see lots of people, prepared him that the party might be loud, and there will be a lot of unfamiliar smells from the food, and that he can ask in a \u201cjust right voice\u201d anytime he needs a break.\u00a0 She had pictures of him in handsome clothes, and wrote that we would be taking lots of pictures.\u00a0 She even wrote out a list of 4 wedding rules for him to follow during the ceremony.\u00a0 His teacher came over to the house yesterday and went through it step by step.\u00a0 And although the picture she used for our car wasn\u2019t exactly right as Howie pointed out, he really got it.\u00a0 At one point he told her that he wanted to be in a safe place for the wedding, and she showed him the page for asking for breaks and gave him the words to use with us.\u00a0 It was awesome. Next we put on our SPD lens   (thanks Martianne) and  looked at the weekend through Howie\u2019s eyes so we could anticipate his needs.\u00a0 I bought Therabands for the car ride up and have his weighted blanket ready to go for both the car and for sleeping.\u00a0 I\u2019m bringing his own pillow for the bed.\u00a0 I asked my mother if she could put us at an end of the head table as far away from the dance floor and speakers as possible, and we\u2019re bringing our noise canceling headphones.\u00a0 Tim\u2019s in charge of taking him outside to the golf course area or even the car if he gets overloaded at the reception.\u00a0 We thought about at staying at a hotel when the weather looked like it was going to be in the 90 degree range because Howie sleeps in long sleeves and four blankets and there\u2019s no air conditioning at my mother\u2019s house.\u00a0 Now the weather looks a little more tolerable, and with some fans for air and white noise I think staying with at her house with my family will be possible.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to stay busy \u2013 walks, kickball games with cousins, races before the wedding, lifting suitcases, obstacle courses \u2013 anything to keep his body moving as much as we can to give him the sensory input he needs. And of course, lots and lots of hugs and squeezes whenever it is requested.\u00a0 Because after all, it is my job to keep him safe.\u00a0 Even at my mother\u2019s wedding. \u201cSpring is here, theeee sky is blue. Whooooa! the birds all sing as if they knew. Today\u2019s the day, we\u2019ll say, \u201cI do\u201d and we\u2019ll never be lonely anymore.\u201d  \u2013 Going to the Chapel by The Crystals \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://traininghappyhearts.blogspot.com/2010/06/waerting-spd-lenses-new-uses-for-your.html"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/06/23/going-to-the-chapel/", "title": "\n\t\t\tGoing to the\u00a0Chapel\t\t"},

{"date": "October 14, 2010", "body": "\u201cI think I like being at school better than being at home.\u201d Those were the words out of my 8 year old Gerry\u2019s mouth the other night.\u00a0 I was wrestling with his younger brothers, getting them ready for the shower, when he tossed that bomb out at me. It wouldn\u2019t have been such a big deal, except for the fact that he is usually complaining about how much he hates school and wishes he could just stay home.\u00a0 So this\u2026this was a total twist. But not a surprise. I\u2019ve waited a while to write about it, suffering some from writer\u2019s block because the emotions and tears get in the way.\u00a0 However, this week I\u2019ve been reading A Diary Of A Mom\u2019s  spotlight on siblings  and her amazing stories of her two daughters have reminded me that I need to put my spotlight back on Gerry.\u00a0 The good, the bad and the ugly. But I couldn\u2019t get past the empty page \u2013 I couldn\u2019t figure out how to put the right words down. So I got some advice from an amazing new friend : \u201cStart in the middle.\u00a0 Don\u2019t look for a beginning.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry about structure.\u00a0 Start with what hurts.\u00a0 Then write.\u201d What I said back was this: \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. Except when it comes to watching my oldest struggle, it all hurts. It\u2019s weird, I can write fairly easily about Howie. Watching him struggle with what he does is painful, but for some reason it doesn\u2019t hit my core of motherhood like it does when I write about what a hard time my 8 yr old is having lately. Maybe because I have come to expect things to be hard for my 4 yr old. I just don\u2019t know how to reach Gerry at all.\u201d I guess I\u2019ll start with that. In the past month or so, we\u2019ve seen quite a change in Gerry\u2019s behavior at home.\u00a0 I hate to even write that. \u00a0 First, he\u2019s a good kid.\u00a0 An AMAZING kid.\u00a0 I\u2019ve written so\u00a0much about  him  before \u2013 he\u2019s the kind of kid that parents want their kids to be friends with.\u00a0 I can trust him to know right from wrong.\u00a0 He\u2019s an excellent student and continues to amaze his teachers with his ability to soak up information and his desire to learn more.\u00a0 He is wise beyond his years and can carry on conversations with his dad that I long to understand.\u00a0 He is an incredible big brother, tolerant and understanding and patient. Usually.\u00a0 Lately, however, not so much. He is becoming increasingly less tolerant of Howie and his behaviors.\u00a0 In the past, he\u2019s been able to somewhat ignore the vocal stimming, the loud outbursts, the constant need for attention.\u00a0 Gerry could play his Lego Star Wars game on the Wii and tune out the noise and chaos around him.\u00a0 He can\u2019t anymore.\u00a0 Everything Howie does annoys him.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been eating in shifts for dinner because Gerry says the noise from Howie chewing with him mouth open is \u201cso annoying I can\u2019t hear myself think!!\u201d (The sensory avoider does not fall far from the sensory avoiding tree\u2026) We\u2019ve done our best to control and help the situation.\u00a0 We\u2019ve told Howie that his babbling and outbursts can happen in our toy room area, but not near the TV or at the dinner table.\u00a0 We\u2019ve tried all sorts of bribes to get Howie to chew more quietly (I must say my husband\u2019s recent \u201cJedi kids have to eat quietly in order to sneak up on the stormtroopers\u201d worked well last night).\u00a0 But we\u2019ve also tried to explain to Gerry that we have to understand that there are things that Howie can\u2019t control, and while we\u2019re working helping him, we all have to be patient and understanding about it. In addition, he\u2019s worrying about Howie constantly.\u00a0 He\u2019s asked me many times about what kindergarten will look like for Howie \u2013 will he have an aide?\u00a0 Will he take the bus or the van?\u00a0 Who will help him?\u00a0 The statement behind the question here is, of course, will it have to be him helping his brother?\u00a0 Again, we\u2019ve tried to explain to Gerry that it\u2019s not his job to worry \u2013 that his dad and I will work it out with the school to make sure Howie is fine in kindergarten. His response?\u00a0 \u201cI  am  the school.\u00a0 This affects  me .\u201d Of course, because he\u2019s so wise beyond his years, we talk to him like he should understand.\u00a0 Like he\u2019s an adult.\u00a0 But he\u2019s not.\u00a0 He\u2019s still eight years old. As his coping mechanism, Gerry spends a lot of time alone.\u00a0 He does his homework alone up at Tim\u2019s desk in our room.\u00a0 He rides his bike outside alone.\u00a0 He retreats to his safe spot \u2013 his room \u2013 to play with his Legos.\u00a0 He reads alone, showers alone, watches TV alone. It breaks my heart.\u00a0 But it\u2019s why his \u201cI like school better than home\u201d comment makes sense.\u00a0 Can you blame him? I\u2019ve spent countless hours these past weeks trying to figure out why things are so different recently.\u00a0 Was it the new school year?\u00a0 Third grade and a new teacher and new friends have brought new stresses and pressure for Gerry.\u00a0 And for the first time, he\u2019s in a class with a few special needs students and their aides.\u00a0 Is it the fact that he uses up all his strength, tolerance and understanding in the classroom and has none left for his brother?\u00a0 Or is this just a \u201cnormal\u201d sibling thing?\u00a0 Has he just reached his breaking point, like we all do? All of the above?\u00a0 None of the above? Go ahead.\u00a0 I know what you\u2019re thinking.\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t I just ask  him ? It\u2019s because he and I never get any time just us. We used to have it.\u00a0 Before his brother was born, we had almost 4 years when it was just  us  everyday.\u00a0 And even after Howie was born, we\u2019d manage to have some time together \u2013 trips to the supermarket, time outside alone, reading books to each other.\u00a0 We even went to New York City for my cousin\u2019s wedding before Lewis was born.\u00a0 We went to the top of the Empire State Building and watched it snow, wandered through FAO Schwartz in amazement, and saw the Statute of Liberty. Where did that special time go?  Hiding somewhere behind the chaos of our everyday lives.  Pushed out by the meltdowns, the tantrums, the need to get dinner on the table before the house falls apart. Gerry and I need to get that time back. Starting this weekend. Last night, after I got Howie to sleep, I climbed into bed with Gerry and told him my new plan.\u00a0 Breakfasts with Mom.\u00a0 Just he and I.\u00a0 At the local diner \u2013 one weekend morning a week.\u00a0 I told him we could talk, or not talk.\u00a0 Eat blueberry muffins and drink hot chocolate and figure out if the table jukebox works. Spotlight back on Gerry. That light needs to be on ALL my kids, so no one is left alone in the shadows of this family. \u201c Sometimes I feel like a motherless child \n  Sometimes I feel like a mother, a motherless child \n  Sometimes I feel like a motherless child \n  A long, long way from my home \u201d \u2013 Motherless Child (spiritual) \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/spotlight-on-siblings-week-continued/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/08/12/sisters-and-brothers/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/motherless-child/", "title": "\n\t\t\tMotherless Child\t\t"},

He contacted me through Facebook, and I wanted to share our conversation here.\u00a0 To protect his privacy, I\u2019m simply going to call him \u201cJay\u201d. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 Jay :\u00a0 I am Jay and I am 19..I have been looking for people on Facebook who know about Autism to chat with as I have Autism myself\u2026it seems you know about Autism. Could we chat? My form of Autism is Asperger Syndrome. Me : Hi Jay! Thanks for connecting. I\u2019m no expert by any means \u2013 my son is 4 and he was diagnosed last Christmas. If you want to check out my blog at  https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/  I have a lot of links on there for good information, especially on Asperger\u2019s. \nIt\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019re reaching out and I would love to talk more. (yes, I know.\u00a0 shameless plug, but I didn\u2019t know the kid and didn\u2019t know what he was looking for) Jay :\u00a0 I was 6 years old and in Kindergarten when I was diagnosed\u2026I\u2019ve always tried my best to overcome it by working hard and doing what I can to help others and be a good kid. I have been bullied a lot and made fun of for my condition. What do you think some affects can be of bullying on an emotional standpoint? If you were to see me or even your own kid bullied, what would you tell the kids it hurts or affects inside the victim?What emotions you know can be hurt by bullying? Like what would you teach kids what bullying can hurt inside others I am taking some online classes on counseling\u2026so obviously stuff like this and your answers would help some. Me :\u00a0 I am so sorry for what you went through. No child should have to endure any amount of bullying. You sound like a very strong person. \nI want to answer all your questions properly, but I have to put my kids to bed.  I will write more tonight. Me :\u00a0 Ok, so here goes.  I hope I answer all your questions. I think bullying can have lifelong lasting effects. The fact that even now you remember what happened as a kid is evidence of that. And I think the effects can go one of three ways : 1) the child grows up to be an adult with lasting emotional scars and can\u2019t recover, 2) the child grows up hating people, and could become a bully themselves, or 3) the child grows up to be an incredibly tolerant, sensitive and caring kid (which sounds like what you have become). I\u2019m in the camp of needing to step in when I see any kids being teased or bullied. I used to step back and wait for the kids\u2019 parents to step in, but that doesn\u2019t happen. Sometimes kids listen better when it\u2019s not their parent talking to them. And sometimes the parents are the ones feeding their bullying tendencies (a vicious cycle). I think you hit on something when you ask about what emotions can be hurt. Instead of the broad \u201chow would you feel if\u2026\u201d question, maybe the right question needs to be \u201cif someone said that to you, would you feel happy? sad?\u201d putting the emotion out there. i think it\u2019s different for different age groups. My hope is that someday kids won\u2019t be bullied because they are a bit different. It might be me just being a hopeful parent, but because so many more kids are being diagnosed at an early age, the differences might not be so apparent. I\u2019m also hopeful that schools will start to do a better job educating parents and kids about differences in learning styles, appearances, etc. so the differences become \u201cnormal\u201d. I know they are doing that at my older kid\u2019s school, and he has no clue which kids in his class are on IEPs or need extra help, because they treat every child as an individual there with individual needs. I\u2019ll say again how sorry I am for what you went through as a kid. It is every parent\u2019s nightmare when you have a kid on the spectrum. I worry every day about my son \u2013 he\u2019s smaller than most kids his age \u2013 and I know he won\u2019t understand if someone is making fun of him or being playful. I will teach him right from wrong, and I hope someday he\u2019ll be able to teach his peers the same thing. Thanks for connecting. I hope that helps a little with your classes. You\u2019ve helped me think a lot about the future and how to talk with my kids about how they are treated. One more website to look at for good info for your classes:   http://endthebullying.wordpress.com/ .  Great blog written by a mom of a child with autism. Good luck and feel free to contact me again. Jay :\u00a0 The bullying really hurt my feelings, so in that, I\u2019ve learned how important feelings are and that you need to get your feelings out, would you agree? I\u2019ve read a lot of kids have trouble expressing their feelings\u2026so I guess am lucky to get my feelings out. How important do you think feelings are in life and do you take feelings very seriously? \nA lot of kids who hurt my feelings and knew they were said they were glad my feelings were hurt and didn\u2019t care about feelings at all and that feelings don\u2019t mean anything. Just hearing this, does it hurt your own feelings? I think feelings is a great subject to talk about and kind of underated. My family has made a commitment to feelings for years. We have lots of books on feelings that we read. That helped me through the bullying, getting the feelings out, reading about hurt feelings and how to get better from them I\u2019d love if you can for me, sit down with your child, and have a talk about feelings. help learn about feelings and how important the feelings are and let me know how it goes, can you do that for me please? Me : ( in tears as I write him back):  You are wise beyond your years, and it sounds like you have wonderful parents. Those kids didn\u2019t deserve to be anywhere near you. And yes, for you and for my kids, feelings will be the optic of tonight\u2019s dinner conversation. On behalf of my family, thank you. would you mind if I wrote about our conversation here? I won\u2019t use your name, but your message is powerful and I\u2019d like to share it. It\u2019s ok if you say no. Jay :\u00a0 Yes you can, no problem at all. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Now, I don\u2019t know who Jay is, and some of you might think\u00a0 he was making this all up and playing me.\u00a0 My sense is that he\u2019s not.\u00a0 I feel like he was just a young man reaching out to someone who might understand him.\u00a0 I do.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter though.\u00a0 His message is what\u2019s important.\u00a0 His story is what every parent worries about. He\u2019s right that a lot of kids on the spectrum have a hard time sharing their feelings appropriately.\u00a0 They have difficulty showing empathy \u2013 something we struggle with every day in our house.\u00a0 But it doesn\u2019t mean that our kids don\u2019t  feel .\u00a0 In many ways, I think they feel even more deeply than the rest of us.\u00a0 They just can\u2019t express it. So, for Jay, tonight we\u2019re going to talk about feelings at dinner.\u00a0 I\u2019ll talk about it different ways with each of my kids.\u00a0 With Gerry, we can talk about what it feels like when someone doesn\u2019t want to play the same game as he does at recess.\u00a0 With Howie, I can ask him how it feels when he doesn\u2019t see his favorite activity out at center time.\u00a0 And with Lewis, even though he\u2019s not quite two, I can still ask him to smile and show me \u201chappy\u201d.\u00a0 And we can all make that happy face at the table together. In honor of  Spirit Day  today, I\u2019m hoping you do the same with your family.\u00a0 Culture changes have to start at home, with us as parents.\u00a0 Let\u2019s talk to our children about their feelings, and teach them how to treat others with respect and tolerance, even if they are just a little different. Because we all want our kids to share like Jay did with me. \u201cHey baby, there ain\u2019t no easy way out \n Hey yeah, I\u2019ll stand my ground \n And I won\u2019t back down Hey baby, there ain\u2019t no easy way out \n Hey yeah, I\u2019ll stand my ground \n And I won\u2019t back down\u201d  \u2013 I Won\u2019t Back Down by Tom Petty \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["../", "http://endthebullying.wordpress.com/", "http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=144778572233301"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/10/20/i-wont-back-down/", "title": "\n\t\t\tI Won\u2019t Back\u00a0Down\t\t"},
{"date": "October 25, 2010", "body": "I\u2019m watching my son Gerry with one of his best friends.\u00a0 They are sitting on the swings in the backyard, reading a Star Wars book together.\u00a0 At their feet are the toy lightsabers that they have been playing with for over an hour. We\u2019ve been talking a lot about friends in our house.\u00a0 Specifically, how do you make new friends? Gerry and his friend have been best buddies since preschool.\u00a0 They live around the corner from us and since the age of four they have been in the same class together, including this year.\u00a0 They have similar personalities, interests and senses of humor.\u00a0 They even look a little alike.\u00a0 When his friend was interested in Transformers, Gerry got interested in Transformers.\u00a0 When his friend started playing Lego Star Wars on the Wii, Gerry asked for it as a birthday present.\u00a0 Everything that his friend liked, Gerry liked. Until recently.\u00a0 Their interests have started to diverge a bit.\u00a0 Gerry\u2019s friend is a huge fan of Harry Potter, wizard stories and magic.\u00a0 Gerry, much like his father, isn\u2019t really interested in those things.\u00a0 His tastes run more in the science fiction/detective genre \u2013 movies like Star Wars and books like Encyclopedia Brown and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\u00a0 Gerry\u2019s friend met some new kids this year in third grade who liked wizardry as much as he did, and because Gerry didn\u2019t role with the Harry Potter crowd, he was feeling a bit left out. Of course, I didn\u2019t know any of this until one day in the car he told me he wanted to make a movie called \u201cThree\u201d.\u00a0 When I asked him what that meant, he said it\u2019s because he feels like he\u2019s three different people \u2013 one person with his friends who like imagination games, one person when he\u2019s playing sports, and one person at home. Pretty astute for a eight year old. It got me thinking about friends in general, and at what point do we begin to compartmentalize our friends into different groups. At Howie\u2019s age in preschool, the teachers say that everyone is your \u201cfriend\u201d.\u00a0 The kids are taught to be respectful of one another and that everyone should play together and get along.\u00a0 The concept of course is great \u2013 that no matter what we treat each other with kindness at the block table and during snack time.\u00a0 For Howie in particular, this is important.\u00a0 He\u2019s lacking the ability to understand how to walk up to a group of kids and ask to play with them, and misses the social cues needed for appropriate game playing and sharing, so he uses social stories and scripts to help him join in. But at some point, most kids start to realize that not everyone is your friend.\u00a0 Maybe it starts along gender lines.\u00a0 Maybe then common interests start to bond \u2013 whether it\u2019s a love of baseball or Legos or Star Wars (if all three could be combined I think my house might explode).\u00a0 And some kids, for better or worse, just aren\u2019t that nice to everyone else.\u00a0 Most kids start to realize that not everyone  has  to be your best buddy. I say  most  kids here because this is a big fear of mine for Howie.\u00a0 He\u2019s getting conditioned to believe that all kids are your friends, when at some point, there will be kids who won\u2019t treat him well because he\u2019s different.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll have the understanding to know when kids are treating him poorly, or telling him to do things that he shouldn\u2019t do in the name of \u201cfriendship\u201d.\u00a0 At some point, the social script has to change.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t know when that happens. I\u2019ve been talking a lot about this with Gerry as he struggled with the fact that this best friend of his was going off with other kids.\u00a0 I reminded him that even though his friend had made new friends, it didn\u2019t mean that their friendship was over.\u00a0 I told him it was a great opportunity for him to try to make new friends himself \u2013 to seek out others who loved Star Wars as much as he did.\u00a0 We did a little role playing about how to talk to another boy in their class who he thought seemed nice, and I even bribed him a bit by offering to let him watch Star Wars: Episode One if he talked to this other boy at snack time. The whole conversation had me thinking about my own friends and if I have my group of \u201cthree\u201d.\u00a0 I have friends who have kids the same age as mine so we talk about homework, and baseball practice and after school activities.\u00a0 I have friends who have kids on the spectrum like Howie and we share stories, struggles and IEP meeting strategies.\u00a0 And there\u2019s the third group of friends \u2013 the people who have known me forever \u2013 the type of friend that you might not see for a year but the moment you\u2019re together it\u2019s like you just saw each other yesterday.\u00a0 The type of friend that you can sit on a bench together in Rockefeller Center and just\u2026be.\u00a0\u00a0 I rely on all of these friends to get me through the day, and without them, I\u2019d be lost. So I get where Gerry is coming from on this.\u00a0 When one piece of that friend puzzle feels like it\u2019s pulling away, it can make you feel a bit out of sorts. It\u2019s five o\u2019clock and I have to tell the boys it\u2019s time for their get together to end.\u00a0 They both look at me with those annoyed faces that eight year olds make.\u00a0 They\u2019ve recently found their way back to each other \u2013 putting aside their diverging interests to get back to just playing.\u00a0 I watch them get on their scooters as they head to the end of our street, where they will separate : Gerry back to our house, and his friend to his house around the corner.\u00a0 About two strides in, they take off, racing each other and laughing so loudly I can hear them through the closed window.\u00a0 They are two best buddies, having fun just\u2026being. Everyone deserves to have that one friend that you can always count on to be there for you no matter what.\u00a0 Of all the things that I wish for my kids, the most important one for me is that they are a good friend.\u00a0 If Howie can find just that one person that he clicks with \u2013 that understands him and likes him, quirks and all \u2013 I\u2019ll be happy.\u00a0 And as I watch Gerry and his friend wave goodbye to each other, I know that for him, that wish has already come true.

But number one?\u00a0 His smile. It\u2019s actually the number one thing I love about all my kids. Gerry and Lewis have very similar smiles.\u00a0 Big grins with lots of teeth.\u00a0 And dimples.\u00a0 They both got my dimples. Howie\u2019s smile?\u00a0 It\u2019s\u2026different from his brothers.\u00a0 Like everything else about him. No dimples.\u00a0 Not toothy. But it\u2019s a smile that just exudes pure happiness.\u00a0 It\u2019s a smile that tells me the things he can\u2019t say himself. When his world is closing in on him, when he\u2019s having a \u201c crummy day \u201c, the smile is gone.\u00a0 No smiles means we\u2019re out of whack.\u00a0 No smiles mean his body is out of sorts.\u00a0 No smiles mean we need help.\u00a0 And a hug without a smile?\u00a0 Those are the hardest hugs of all. But if I can make him smile?\u00a0 If I can hear that infectious giggle that comes from a tickle, or a silly joke, or the promise of \u201chugs that go on forever and never stop\u201d\u2026then I know we\u2019re ok.

{"date": "October 22, 2010", "body": "Dear Jan the dental hygienist- I just had to write you and thank you for today\u2019s visit with Howie at the dentist.\u00a0 I have to tell you \u2013 I had been dreading this visit all week, all month really.\u00a0 Every time I looked up at the calendar and saw \u201cHowie: dentist appointment 11:15am\u201d I got a lump in my throat.\u00a0 There were a million different ways today could have gone awry.\u00a0 But it didn\u2019t.\u00a0 Thanks to you. Maybe I should back up and tell you what a rotten week I\u2019d had.\u00a0 Or should I say \u201ccrummy week\u201d, because that\u2019s the word that Howie used to describe his day on Tuesday.\u00a0 The week started with some conversations with a few people who I thought really understood me, but then I realized that wasn\u2019t the case.\u00a0 Then came Howie\u2019s \u201ccrummy\u201d Tuesday \u2013 a day where everything went wrong for him at school.\u00a0 I tried to take away some positives from that day \u2013 his teachers had said he was very articulate about why he was having such a hard time \u2013 but it was still breaking my heart to see him so angry about school.\u00a0 Four year olds just shouldn\u2019t have bad days.\u00a0 That night ended with him asking for his usual three blankets on his bed, plus his weighted blanket, a giant body pillow and his three foot long stuffed dog in bed with him.\u00a0 The kid was out of sorts even at bedtime. Wednesday came along with new challenges and guilt.\u00a0 I took Lewis to the doctor for his two year old checkup.\u00a0 The kid screamed from the moment we entered the exam room until we left.\u00a0 And I mean screamed.\u00a0 He must have some post-traumatic stress thing going on with the doctor\u2019s office from being there so much.\u00a0 When he was four months old, he had bronchiolitis and we made many trips to that office to check his breathing.\u00a0 In recent months, we\u2019ve been in to get his ears cleaned after worrying about his  speech delay .\u00a0 Can\u2019t blame the kid for hating the place.\u00a0 He calmed down enough during the appointment for the doctor to advise me to get an independent speech evaluation.\u00a0 The guilt was swirling around me as she said \u201cI don\u2019t think he has PDD, but\u2026\u201d, and then Lewis started screaming again.\u00a0 And in my head, I was screaming too. Jan, Thursday came and it was Lewis\u2019\u00a0 2nd birthday.\u00a0 I was still recovering from Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.\u00a0 More guilt piled on me as I realized that I had no party planned, no cake made, and no presents wrapped.\u00a0 He was falling into the classic \u201cthird child syndrome\u201d.\u00a0 On a day when I should have been celebrating, I was wallowing in family pity.\u00a0 The day ended ok, after a reminder from my husband that \u201che\u2019s two \u2013 he doesn\u2019t know\u201d, but I still felt like I was failing him and my family.\u00a0 The kids weren\u2019t happy and I couldn\u2019t even pull together a simple birthday party for my own kid.\u00a0 What was happening here? So Jan, you can imagine how I felt when Friday arrived and it was time for Howie\u2019s dentist appointment.\u00a0 Of course, first we had to get through our monthly team meeting for him at his preschool.\u00a0 The whole ride to his school I was cursing myself for scheduling two anxiety riddled events in one day.\u00a0 But the team meeting went really well.\u00a0 He\u2019s doing great in school and two months in, he\u2019s fitting in just right in the full day inclusion program.\u00a0 This week had been tough for him, they said, but it was an anomaly and not the norm.\u00a0 His teachers were looking at this week as a teachable moment \u2013 his \u201cengine\u201d was running high all week and he was having a hard time regulating himself.\u00a0 I told them I was pretty sure he was coming down with the same cold his brothers had, and his sensory issues are usually out of control about 3-4 days before he actually gets sick.\u00a0 His teachers really seem to understand him and his needs, and I am constantly impressed by how well they work with him. Even after all this, I was sure I should have canceled that dentist appointment.\u00a0 We really needed it to go well.\u00a0 Jan, his last experience at the dentist was miserable.\u00a0 It was their policy that parents stayed in the waiting room when the kids were having their teeth cleaned, and they stuck with that even after I told them he was on the spectrum and had sensory issues.\u00a0 Fifteen minutes in, I could hear him crying.\u00a0 I went to check, and they stopped me and told me he was fine.\u00a0 When he came out another ten minutes later, I could barely hear what the dentist was saying over his sobbing.\u00a0 I knew right then we had to find another place. Which brought me to your practice, Jan.\u00a0 We had to get this one right or else I feared I\u2019d never get him back to a dentist again.\u00a0 I talked about it all week.\u00a0 Offered all sorts of rewards and earning opportunities. \u00a0 And I made that call that I dread \u2013 I called your office before the appointment and told them he was autistic.\u00a0 I struggle with this all the time, the \u201cshould I tell\u201d and the \u201cwho should I tell\u201d.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to say anything.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want my son thought of as being different.\u00a0 But I had to.\u00a0 I needed him to be treated differently this time.\u00a0 I needed you to know before we walked in that door. And Jan, you were wonderful.\u00a0 You took us in quickly and quietly told me you had been given the \u201cheads up\u201d.\u00a0 You looked right at him when you spoke and guided him gently through the appointment.\u00a0 You told him we were doing \u201cscience experiments\u201d when you painted his teeth purple (his favorite color) to see the plaque.\u00a0 You let him sit on my lap the whole time, and whenever he got nervous, you backed off, talked to him about what you were doing, and took your cues from him.\u00a0 And he did it.\u00a0 He had his teeth cleaned, polished, and covered in fluoride.\u00a0 I was amazed. When I thanked you for your kindness and understanding, you told me you  knew .\u00a0 You told me about your cousin\u2019s child with sensory issues and your nephew with Asperger\u2019s.\u00a0 And that clinched it for me.\u00a0 You  got  it.\u00a0 I should have known. And that\u2019s why I had to hug you when we left.\u00a0 If anyone knew that I did that, they\u2019d be shocked.\u00a0 I\u2019m not a hugger.\u00a0 But it was the only way I could express my gratitude for what you did for us this morning without crying.\u00a0 You took what could have been a potentially disastrous appointment and turned it into something special.\u00a0 Life changing.\u00a0 My son left there with his giant purple balloon and told me he \u201creally liked this new dentist\u201d.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t agree more. On behalf of my family and my son\u2019s teeth, I thank you for all that you did. See you in six months.

{"date": "March 11, 2011", "body": "Umi-goggles on! Little Bear? You see Little Bear, saaaaaay LITTLE BEAR! I made the call.\u00a0 But this time it was to cancel an appointment, not make one. The quote above?\u00a0 From my 2 year old Lewis.\u00a0 He\u2019s not just talking now.\u00a0 He\u2019s  speaking , having conversations, and using lines from TV shows and making them his own.\u00a0 This spontaneous phrase combined a line from the Nick Jr. show \u201cTeam Umizoomi\u201d with a picture from his Little Bear toothpaste container.\u00a0 He put his arms up to his eyes for the goggles, and tried to look for his toothpaste. The canceled appointment?\u00a0 His scheduled meeting with the zero-to-three developmental clinic for an autism evaluation. The appointment had been recommended to us by Howie\u2019s developmental pediatrician when I expressed concerns about Lewis\u2019 language delay.\u00a0 Remember her?\u00a0 She\u2019s the one that called me \u201c Super Mom \u201c.\u00a0 At the time the appointment seemed like the fastest way in to see a speech/language pathologist, but she also mentioned that a full evaluation would be a good idea, considering Howie\u2019s diagnosis. It took me a long time to send in the paperwork.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t put  Lewis\u2019 picture  on the forms.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t go through it all again. But I finally put the package in the mail.\u00a0 Without the picture.\u00a0 And two weeks later I received the appointment date and time.\u00a0 March 21st. In the time since I mailed the papers, we\u2019ve seen an explosion of language and development.\u00a0 And now, I see none of the red flags of autism.\u00a0 None. I see pretend play as he zooms a car around the house and makes rumbling noises, or pours me a cup of  pretend tea .\u00a0 I see the ability to follow first/then commands and multi-step directions when I ask him to get his shoes, bring them to me, and then we\u2019ll go outside.\u00a0 I see tantrums caused by his inability to have a toy rather than meltdowns triggered by his inability to control his body.\u00a0 I see him look me in the eye when we talk and I feel him hug me out of love.\u00a0 I see an understanding of emotions when he draws a happy face and labels it \u201chappy!\u201d. Yes, he\u2019s drawing.\u00a0 Recognizable faces.\u00a0 And he can make the letter \u201cL\u201d.\u00a0 From following my instructions. All the \u201cappropriate\u201d developmental milestones for a two year old.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing now. I\u2019m trying so hard to focus on how wonderful that is, and not that we\u2019re still working on many of those milestones with Howie.\u00a0 Our almost five year old.\u00a0 They are almost evenly matched now in the social development area.\u00a0 That\u2019s still hard to face.\u00a0 Because it won\u2019t be long before Lewis moves ahead of Howie in many areas.\u00a0 And then where will we be? Mom! Mom! Get coat and go Kyle\u2019s house! This was yesterday.\u00a0 Lewis grabbed his coat and handed it to me, asking to go to his friend\u2019s house.\u00a0 I was bursting with pride.\u00a0 How could I say no?\u00a0 He and I now have conversations, share cups of \u201chot toffee (coffee)\u201d, read books and sing along to Glee together.\u00a0 The articulation isn\u2019t quite there yet, so I\u2019m still going to have early intervention back when he\u2019s 30 months old, just to make sure he\u2019s on track for his age.\u00a0 Just because I can understand him doesn\u2019t mean the rest of the world can. Right now, though, I\u2019ll take it.\u00a0 It was so different from where we were  a year ago  with him.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I canceled the appointment. Last month, I wrote a post called  Mother\u2019s Intuition  about learning to trust your gut when something\u2019s wrong with your child.\u00a0 I\u2019m using my mother\u2019s intuition again.\u00a0 This time, however, it\u2019s to say that everything is going to be okay. I may be wrong.\u00a0 But my eyes are wide open and I will be looking for any and every sign along the way.\u00a0 And if I see something that makes me nervous, I know I\u2019ll have the strength to trust my gut and make the call once again.

{"date": "January 3, 2011", "body": "I\u2019m watching my son. He\u2019s playing on the Wii \u2013 the  Nickelodeon Wii Fit  game the boys got for the holidays.  I\u2019m behind him so he doesn\u2019t know that I have tears in my eyes as I watch him play. \u201cLook, Mom!\u201d, he says. \u201cI\u2019m running with Pablo from The Backyardigans!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s very cool.\u201d I say back to him, keeping my voice from shaking. I\u2019m watching him run in place with the remote in his hand.\u00a0\u00a0 When he runs, it makes the Nick Jr. character on the screen run too.  This is the only game he\u2019ll play on the Wii.\u00a0 He says all the other games are too hard.\u00a0 Truth is, he hasn\u2019t even tried them.\u00a0 He\u2019s too afraid of losing. His little body is right in front of the TV.\u00a0 He\u2019s trying to stay in the same spot as he runs, but he keeps bumping into the toy box in front of him.  \u201cWhen I run really fast, I make stars come out of Pablo\u2019s butt!\u201d\u00a0  He laughs hysterically at this.\u00a0 My two year old is standing right there patiently waiting his turn, and starts laughing too.\u00a0 Their laughs are infectious and I start to giggle as well. (As a side note, this same two year old has unlocked every level on this game.\u00a0 I\u2019m equally depressed, proud and mortified.) \u201cNow I\u2019m making Dora the Explorer run too!\u201d He\u2019s making these jerky running motions \u2013 legs flailing out to the side.\u00a0 It reminds me a bit of that Seinfield episode where Elaine dances.  He\u2019s so small.\u00a0 My middle son.\u00a0 My four year old in the size 2T pants.\u00a0 Thin enough to still wear all his same winter clothes from last year.\u00a0 Small enough to crawl up into my lap and disappear into my arms.\u00a0 Tiny enough that his two year old brother is wearing pants that only three months ago were in my four year old\u2019s drawers. I\u2019m still watching as he gets Dora closer to the finish line.\u00a0 I know why I\u2019m studying him so closely. On Thursday, we have his IEP meeting.\u00a0 Our first one since we set his initial plan up last year.\u00a0 And at this meeting, we\u2019ll be planning for kindergarten. Kindergarten. Still nine months away, but the IEP will be written for the full year.\u00a0 That includes his summer program and start at the elementary school in August. I\u2019m looking at this little body moving in front of the TV.\u00a0 Kindergarten.\u00a0 How can he be ready for kindergarten? His teachers say he\u2019s ready.\u00a0 His school OT told me he was ready.\u00a0 Academically, I know he\u2019s ready.\u00a0 In fact, there are no academic goals in his IEP.\u00a0 Only social and behavioral.  And that\u2019s where I worry.\u00a0 I see this tiny person and I think of him at the school where my older son is now.\u00a0 I try to visualize him moving from 17 kids and 6 pairs of teacher eyes on him at the preschool to 25 kids and two teachers, plus whatever aides happen to be in the room.\u00a0 I close my eyes and picture him eating his lunch in the cafeteria, surrounded by 40 other kids and all that sensory overload.\u00a0 I think of him getting on and off the big yellow bus that I promised he could ride when he turned five. (Oh God.\u00a0 The bus.\u00a0 My just-over-thirty-pound kid on the bus?\u00a0 Am I going to have to go back on my promise to let him take that bus?) In his inclusion class at the preschool, no one notices his differences now.\u00a0 The kids there are at all different academic and social levels.\u00a0 Every child is equal, every child is a \u201cfriend\u201d.\u00a0 Even though the aides are assigned to a specific child, they are considered teachers in the class and kids like mine don\u2019t stick out.  On Thursday, I have to make sure that continues to happen in kindergarten.\u00a0 I have to make sure that when another kid sees my son run towards him on the playground, coming at him with those jerky leg movements\u2026I have to make sure he\u2019s protected somehow. \u201cMom! Mom!\u00a0 Moose and Zee gave me a silver medal!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s awesome, kiddo.\u201d ( Moose and Zee give everyone a silver medal unless you get a high score, and then the medal is gold.\u00a0 It IS feel good Nick Jr. after all ). \u201cDo you want to play another game?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m done.\u201d\u00a0  He hands the remote to his 2 year old brother, who adeptly maneuvers his way through the screen menu to start jumping on a pogo stick with Dora.\u00a0 (Like I said, depressed/proud/mortified.)

{"date": "April 25, 2011", "body": "\u201cWe\u2019re selling the boat.\u00a0 Trying not to be completely sad about it.\u201d That was my Facebook status yesterday as my husband pulled the boat out of the garage to clean it up so we could sell it.\u00a0 It was the first time the boat had been outside of that garage in five years. That\u2019s when we moved here.\u00a0 It\u2019s been five years.\u00a0 It\u2019s actually been six years since we\u2019ve used the boat.\u00a0 Clearly, it\u2019s time to sell it. But it\u2019s making me very sad. I\u2019m not usually the sentimental type to get attached to things.\u00a0 There isn\u2019t much in his house that I\u2019m connected too, except maybe our  green recliner .\u00a0 But there\u2019s a lot of emotion tied up for me with that boat. The first (only?) vacation that Tim and I took together as a couple was a week on a New Hampshire lake with friends.\u00a0 Summers were spent out on that boat \u2013 camping at the marina at night and lazily floating in the sandbar during the day, working on crossword puzzles and reading the newspaper.\u00a0 Much of our pre-kid time was centered on boating. I suppose there\u2019s a lot of emotion tied up with boats in general for me.\u00a0 I remember being twelve or thirteen and going to get my family\u2019s first ski boat.\u00a0 We picked it up on a particularly windy day and took hours motoring back to our marina, closely hugging the shores of Lake Champlain.\u00a0 My father taught us how to waterski off of that boat, and how to navigate the choppy waters of the lake.\u00a0 We would spend weekends with my cousins going back and forth in a tiny cove on the New York side of the lake.\u00a0 He taught me how to dock the boat and how to tie the knots to hold it tight. I also remember it being a money pit and it needing constant maintenance.\u00a0 As we got older we used the boat less and less.\u00a0 When the marina fees jumped in price, we no longer kept the boat at the dock.\u00a0 The more time it took to take the boat out, the less time we actually used it.\u00a0 And eventually, my parents got rid of it.\u00a0 It just wasn\u2019t worth it anymore. And that\u2019s where we are now with our boat.\u00a0 We\u2019re now over two hours from our old lake.\u00a0 What was once a manageable trip is now a ridiculous undertaking.\u00a0 Under the best of circumstances.\u00a0 Hours in the car for potentially a short amount of time on the water.\u00a0 Hundreds of dollars in fuel now that gas prices are so high.\u00a0 Boat insurance.\u00a0 Time spent just getting the boat ready for the trip.\u00a0 Add in the unpredictable nature of autism and SPD and three young boys who have never been boating before\u2026 I\u2019m not blaming this on my son\u2019s autism and SPD.\u00a0 But I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s not a factor in all of this.\u00a0 Because autism and SPD are a part of him and a part of our family.\u00a0 It has changed how we view\u2026everything.\u00a0 It\u2019s weaved through everything we plan and do together.\u00a0 I can\u2019t just dismiss it and think he\u2019ll be fine.\u00a0 And I can\u2019t dismiss how my other two kids would react if my son falls apart. Sigh. There are dozens of reasons to get rid of the boat.\u00a0\u00a0 There\u2019s just one reason to keep it. I feel like I\u2019m giving up.\u00a0 I feel like I\u2019ve failed. Boating as a family has always been my dream.\u00a0 We don\u2019t ski, or camp, or spend summers at the beach.\u00a0 Boating was going to be our  thing .\u00a0 I had visions of spending time with the boys at a rented house on a lake every summer.\u00a0 Watching Tim teach them how to swim, and ski, and tie knots.\u00a0 Pictures of them driving the boat around the cove.\u00a0 Laughing as we told them it was okay to pee in the lake. Selling the boat feels like I\u2019m selling that dream.\u00a0 It\u2019s the final realization that our family just can\u2019t do all the things I thought we would do.\u00a0 We already skip family gatherings, birthday parties, and other events because it\u2019s just too hard.\u00a0\u00a0 I held tight to that boat in the garage because it was holding onto the last symbol of what I thought our family was supposed to be. Friends have been telling us to sell the boat for years.\u00a0 \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to have your car in the garage?\u201d, they\u2019d ask. I don\u2019t care about having a spot for my car.\u00a0 I care about finding that one activity that pulls my family together as one. I\u2019m trying to see this as a dream deferred.\u00a0 It\u2019s just not the right time for our family to own a boat.\u00a0 I know we can find something else that we can all do together.\u00a0 Something that works for every single member of our five person crew. And maybe someday the time will be right again for us to have a boat.\u00a0 Maybe when the kids are older.\u00a0 Or maybe when they have kids. I\u2019m going to let the boat go. It\u2019s just a boat, right?\u00a0 It\u2019s just a boat. \u201cIt\u2019s not far to never never land \n  No reason to pretend \n  And if the wind is right you can find the joy \n  Of innocence again \n  The canvas can do miracles \n  Just you wait and see \n  Believe me  Sailing \n  Takes me away \n  To where I\u2019ve always heard it could be \n  Just a dream and the wind to carry me \n  And soon I will be free\u201d  \u2013 Sailing by Christopher Cross \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/i-wonder-what-would-happen-to-this-world/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/04/25/sailing/", "title": "\n\t\t\tSailing\t\t"},
{"date": "May 1, 2011", "body": "It\u2019s time to put the blue light away, but I can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s May 1st.\u00a0 April has come to an end and so has Autism Awareness Month.\u00a0 So I should be putting our big blue light away in the basement, labeled in a box so I can find it for next year. But I\u2019m not ready.\u00a0 Or more importantly, my son\u2019s not ready. My 5 year old Howie?\u00a0 He loves that blue light. Four weeks ago, my husband took our oldest Gerry to Home Depot to buy the special blue bulbs for our front door lights.\u00a0 While there, Gerry had the idea of getting a big floodlight and shining it  on  to the house, so the whole house would be blue. Perfect. So every night for the past 30 days, our house turned blue at exactly 7pm. In the beginning of the month, it was still dark outside at that time.\u00a0 The light would shine bright through the bay window in our front room.\u00a0 As the days went on, it became more and more light outside.\u00a0 And now, it turns on even when the spring sunshine is still coming through the window. Tonight I thought back on these past 30 days.\u00a0 Days that brought us an awareness campaign that started with a  conversation  with Parents Magazine and ended with 31 amazing stories in their \u201c Voices of Autism \u201d series.\u00a0 A month that started with a  plea  to the White House to \u201cLight It Up Blue\u201d that ended with an  autism summit  like no other.\u00a0 Friends becoming activists just by  walking into Home Depot . Friends sharing their  stories  for the very first time. It started dark as a community searched for some common ground on what awareness meant.\u00a0 It\u2019s ending as a community coming together asking to continue to conversation.\u00a0 A community knowing that autism awareness does not end just because the calendar changes.\u00a0 Every day is autism awareness day in our houses. So no, I wasn\u2019t ready to turn off our blue spotlight.\u00a0 But I thought I\u2019d better ask the person who cared about it the most.\u00a0 My son. Snuggling in bed tonight, I asked him if he thought it was time to turn off the big blue light outside.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t know why it\u2019s on.\u00a0 He never asked.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t care.\u00a0 He just thinks it\u2019s cool. \u201cNo, Mom! Please leave the light on.\u00a0 Look \u2013 it makes my ceiling blue.\u201d I looked up.\u00a0 There were four squares of blue light in the middle of his ceiling.\u00a0 All month long, the light has been coming through his bedroom window, shining on him as he sleeps. That was good enough for me. Now is the time to keep the conversation going.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to shine the light on autism in our family long after everyone else turns their lights off. We\u2019ll keep our light on for the 1 in 110 children affected by autism.\u00a0 And their siblings.\u00a0 And their grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and neighbors.

{"date": "June 8, 2011", "body": "\u201cMom!\u00a0 I can smell the wind!\u201d It was a Saturday afternoon and I was off to get my hair cut.\u00a0 I needed one desperately \u2013 it had been about 5 months since my last one, and it was clearly way overdue.\u00a0 It was a perfect warm sunny day. And at the last minute, I decided to take Howie with me. He climbed into the car and settled into his seat.\u00a0 I buckled him in and told him where we were going.\u00a0 No preparation ahead of time.\u00a0 I slid the van door closed and got into my seat. \u201cMom, can you roll down the windows?\u201d I was surprised by this request, to say the least.\u00a0 My sensory seeker becomes a sensory avoider when it comes to wind.\u00a0 He has always hated having the windows open in the car, ever since he was a baby.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t like the feel of the wind on his face, or the noise that the air makes as it rushes through the car.\u00a0 He hates any loud noise, really, except when he\u2019s the one making it. I\u2019m the opposite.\u00a0 One of my favorite things ab0ut spring and summer was the windows down in the car.\u00a0 The feeling of the wind flowing past me calms me while I drive.\u00a0 The noise is comforting.\u00a0 And for 5 summers, I\u2019ve missed it.\u00a0 Windows have been kept up and the air conditioning on around my kid. Until today. I rolled down the windows halfway on both sides and pulled out of the driveway. \u201cRoll them down more.\u00a0 All the way.\u00a0 Make them match.\u201d I obliged, and we were on our way. We live about ten minutes from the highway entrance, so for the first part of the ride we were traveling about 35 miles an hour.\u00a0 Every once in a while I\u2019d check in to see how he was doing. \u201cToo windy?\u201d, I\u2019d ask. \u201cNo!\u201d, came the response each time.\u00a0 His hands bobbed up and down in the wind as it flowed past him. Then the request : \u201cCan you turn the music on?\u201d This too has been something I\u2019ve missed.\u00a0 I love listening to music in the car \u2013 my music.\u00a0 But for so long the radio has taken a back seat to the kids\u2019 movies, or nothing at all. Usually when Howie asks for \u201cmusic\u201d he means Sheryl Crow\u2019s \u201cSoak Up the Sun\u201d over and over again.\u00a0 And again. This time, I turned on the radio.\u00a0 \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d I asked. \u201cFantastic.\u201d He was quiet as he listened to the different songs come on over the speakers.\u00a0 Occasionally, he would ask what a word meant from a song or tell me that \u201cthis song is all about fireworks!\u201d (thank you Katy Perry).\u00a0 But for the most part, he just sat back and\u2026relaxed. We turned on to the entrance ramp for the highway and I started to roll up the windows.\u00a0 I explained that we were going to be going really fast and that it would get very noisy and windy in the car. Howie protested.\u00a0 \u201cNo!\u00a0 Leave them open!\u201d So I did. I hit the highway at 50 miles an hour.\u00a0 Then 55\u2026then 60. It got noisier and noisier in the car.\u00a0 Howie was still smiling. 65 miles an hour.\u00a0 Then 70.\u00a0 Still no complaining. I turned the radio up as I approached 75 miles an hour.\u00a0 \u201cLearn to Fly\u201d by the Foo Fighters came over the speakers. \u201cMOM!\u201d Howie yelled from the back of the car.\u00a0 \u201cI can smell the wind!\u201d We arrived at my hair cut right on time.\u00a0 For the 20 minutes it took to wash and cut my hair, Howie sat perfectly right next to me with my iPad, intent on beating my high score.\u00a0 Amidst all the noises and smells in the salon, he focused on his game.\u00a0 As we were leaving the receptionist said he was the best behaved boy they had seen in there in while. The windows were open again on the ride home, and we were able to proudly announce to Dad that we made \u201cgreen choices\u201d for the whole trip. ********** Sometimes I get so stuck in our ways that I forget to push the envelope a little.\u00a0 I worry that if we don\u2019t drive to school on a certain road, or eat pizza from a particular place, or run out of green straws, the whole world will fall apart.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to do the things we always do, even if it\u2019s meant giving up something that I enjoy. Like having the windows down. It just took one time to try it.\u00a0 Now the windows are down every single time we\u2019ve been out since then. And together, my son and I can smell the wind. \u201c Fly along with me, I can\u2019t quite make it alone \n Try and make this life my own (and) \n Fly along with me, I can\u2019t quite make it alone \n Try and make this life my own. . .

{"date": "June 24, 2011", "body": "So, how much sharing is too much? It\u2019s Wednesday morning, and my family was in the lobby of our hotel.\u00a0 We\u2019re on our annual trek to our favorite place on Earth:  Storyland  in New Hampshire.\u00a0 We\u2019ve come down for the hotel\u2019s free breakfast, and we\u2019re crowded around the tiny table. Well, not all of us.\u00a0 I had removed Howie from the sitting area because his behavior was becoming quite disruptive.\u00a0 I plopped him down in the chair in front of the reservation desk, handed him a Storyland map, and told him to plan out our day.\u00a0 I strategically placed myself halfway between him and our table, so I could keep an eye on everyone.\u00a0 And suck down my free coffee at the same time. At that moment, a mom and her son came in.\u00a0 He looked to be about seven years old or so.\u00a0 She asked if I was waiting for a table, and as I gestured to my left and right I explained that I was keeping track of my crew.\u00a0 She smiled and grabbed a table in the middle of the room.\u00a0 Her husband and daughter came in behind them. A few minutes later, I heard her tell her son to \u201cjust go out and ask them what they like about Storyland.\u00a0 He has a map right there.\u201d\u00a0 Her son comes right out, glances back at his mom, and turns to Howie. \u201cSo, what do you like about Storyland?\u201d Howie\u2019s eyes lit up.\u00a0 It was\u00a0 like asking  Dino Dan  what he likes about dinosaurs. (in case you don\u2019t know, Storyland is Howie\u2019s second  obsession  after Hot Wheels cars.\u00a0 He asks almost every day \u201chow many more sleeps\u201d until we\u2019re going.\u00a0 And on the days when he doesn\u2019t ask, he talks about his favorite rides.\u00a0 Constantly.) For a good ten minutes the conversation flowed.\u00a0 \u201cI like the polar coaster!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going on the Flying Fish!\u201d \u201cDo you like the train?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to ride on the green one!\u201d \u201cDid you know there\u2019s a circus\u201d\u2026and on and on and on\u2026until: \u201cMom!\u00a0 I made a new friend!\u201d From Howie. Of course, he didn\u2019t know the kid\u2019s name or anything about him.\u00a0 They just connected on Storyland and that was enough.\u00a0 Frankly I was surprised he didn\u2019t say \u201cI made a new  best  friend!\u201d The rest of us finished our breakfast and headed back up to the room to get ready for our big day at the park.\u00a0 Our new friend Gabe (yes, we now knew his name) and his dad rode up with us.\u00a0 And they were still talking about Storyland. We said our goodbyes at the elevator and the perfunctory \u201csee you at the park\u201d, gathered our things and went our separate ways. In the parking lot, I realized I had forgotten something in the room.\u00a0 I headed back to the lobby, and ran into Gabe\u2019s dad outside of the door. Something overtook me at that moment.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what it was.\u00a0 For some reason, I was compelled to talk to him.\u00a0 To thank him.\u00a0 So I did. \u201cI just have to thank you and your son.\u00a0 He\u2019s a great kid and my boys had a nice time talking with him about the park.\u00a0 My five year old\u2026um\u2026he has high functioning autism, and it\u2019s hard for him to relate to kids sometimes, so\u2026um\u2026that was really great for me and him.\u00a0 Thank you.\u201d\u00a0 And I turned and walked into the hotel.\u00a0 His wife was walking out right then.\u00a0 She looked at me quizzically and said \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have him fill me in.\u201d I have never shared that information with a stranger.\u00a0 A complete and total stranger. There was no immediate reason for me to tell them any of that.\u00a0 The only time I\u2019ve ever told anyone about Howie\u2019s autism was as an explanation for his behavior.\u00a0 And it\u2019s only to a person who we already know.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never considered it anyone\u2019s business before.\u00a0 And clearly, they didn\u2019t need to know it.\u00a0 They came into breakfast five minutes past the verbal outbursts, the refusal to eat, and the inability to sit still.\u00a0 All they saw was a perfectly behaved five year old, talking about his favorite vacation spot. But I saw something different.\u00a0 I saw my son connect with another young boy \u2013 one that he had never met before. A boy that seemed a little like\u2026mine. What was it that got my radar up?\u00a0 Was it the excited way that he talked too?\u00a0 Or was it the fact that his mother asked me twice if he was bothering my boys?\u00a0 Or was it the little tears that welled up in her eyes when I told her that Howie said that he made a new friend? Something compelled me to tell that family our story.\u00a0 It was the thought that maybe we shared something else besides our love for the Whirling Whale ride. We saw the family two times at the park that day.\u00a0 Once they were getting off one ride, and we were getting on.\u00a0 There was a quick hello, and that was it.\u00a0 Later on, I saw the mom.\u00a0 She was walking alone, talking on the phone.\u00a0 She glanced at me, and looked away. I\u2019m guessing now that my radar was off that day.\u00a0 I was wrong. And I scared her. I expected a teary \u201cyes, us too!\u201d. What I got was a \u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d I spent the rest of the day thinking about this encounter.\u00a0 What did I expect to gain from sharing, or in this case, oversharing?\u00a0 Why did I need them to know?\u00a0 Why did I need to connect with this family?\u00a0 They were strangers then and are strangers now. Why did I need to make my son the topic of her next mom\u2019s night out? I guess it\u2019s that feeling of not wanting to be alone.\u00a0 I thought she\u2019d be a mom who \u201cgets it\u201d.\u00a0 Instead, she was a mom who didn\u2019t want to understand. However\u2026 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d do anything different any other time. You just never know when you\u2019ll get that teary \u201cyes, us too.\u201d That moment can make all the difference. Let's get together at Storyland (more about our actual visit to Storyland in my next post.\u00a0 As soon as I finish unpacking\u2026could be weeks\u2026) \u201c And the trouble I find is that the trouble finds me \n  It\u2019s a part of my mind it begins with a dream \n  And a feeling I get when I look and I see \n  That this world is a puzzle, I\u2019ll find all of the pieces \n  And put it all together, and then I\u2019ll rearrange it \n  I\u2019ll follow it forever \n  Always be as strange as it seems \n  Nobody ever told me not to try \u201d \u2013 Talk of the Town by Jack Johnson \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.storylandnh.com/", "http://www.nickjr.com/dino-dan/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/tag/storyland/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/267614_2145662207733_1431616213_32544979_1304199_n.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/talk-of-the-town/", "title": "\n\t\t\tTalk of the\u00a0Town\t\t"},
{"date": "June 29, 2011", "body": "It\u2019s my son\u2019s \u201cHappy Place\u201d. For the past seven years in June we\u2019ve been taking the kids to  Story Land  amusement park in Glen, New Hampshire.\u00a0 Our first year was with just one kid.\u00a0 Now we\u2019re a loud and rowdy family of five. Story Land has become Howie\u2019s place. Something clicked with him and this park when he was two.\u00a0 Before I even knew what a stim was, he would sit hunched over the map on our floor, rocking back and forth.\u00a0 He knew where every ride was, where the eating places were, and where the exit was (\u201cX marks the spot\u201d).\u00a0 He would talk about it constantly.\u00a0 And those nights before we discovered melatonin \u2013 when Howie would take hours to fall asleep and wake up at 2am screaming \u2013 Tim would take out his phone and scroll through the pictures of our previous trip.\u00a0 \u201cSee, that\u2019s you on the flying shoes!\u00a0 And that\u2019s you and Mom on the train.\u00a0 Look, that\u2019s you driving a car.\u201d Quietly and slowly, Howie would fall back to sleep again. Every day he asks how many more \u201csleeps\u201d until Story Land.\u00a0 And when I say every day, I mean every day.\u00a0 Three hundred and sixty days a year for the past three years.\u00a0 I\u2019m subtracting out the days that we\u2019re actually at the park.\u00a0 In the winter he asks how long before the snow melts and Story Land is open.\u00a0 In the spring he asks how long before the workers open up the park.\u00a0 In the summer he asks to show him on the calendar the number of the day that we\u2019re going.\u00a0 And when we return, he asks when we\u2019re going back. Our trip up there was last week.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m starting to understand him better, but I finally could see what he sees. I saw a place where all three of my kids could ride on every ride. I saw a place where stories come to life \u2013 not in a scary way with lots of people in costumes (because we don\u2019t do people in costumes) \u2013 but in a nice gentle approach-if-you-want kind of way. I saw a place where the kids didn\u2019t have to hold my hand, but they could hold each other\u2019s hands. I saw a place where kids could drive their parents around in cars. I saw a place that had food that was safe to eat, because they publish all of their food\u2019s ingredients online so we knew what we could buy. I saw a place where all three of my boys were happy.\u00a0 No fighting.\u00a0 No complaining about stimming or verbal outbursts.\u00a0 Happy.\u00a0 All at the same time.\u00a0 For three days straight. I took a moment to look through the eyes of my five year old.\u00a0 What I saw was magic. You can have Disney.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take Story Land. Three hundred and fifty five days until we go back. \"The sun will always shine where you stand \r\n Depending in which land \r\n You may find yourself. \r\n Now you have my blessing, go your way. \r\n Happiness runs in a circular motion \r\n Thought is like a little boat upon the sea. \r\n Everybody is a part of everything anyway, \r\n You can have everything if you let yourself be. \r\n Happiness runs, happiness runs. \r\n Happiness runs, happiness runs. \" - Happiness Runs by Donovan \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.storylandnh.com/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/storyland1.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/storylandpumpkin.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/storylandfoodsteps.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/storylandhug.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/storylandcar.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/storylandfood.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/storyland2.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/06/29/happiness-runs/", "title": "\n\t\t\tHappiness Runs\t\t"},
{"date": "May 11, 2011", "body": "On Saturday, I met an old friend for the first time. Several months ago, I struck up a friendship online with a fellow blogger  Spectrummy Mummy .\u00a0 It happened very naturally.\u00a0 Our writing styles are similar.\u00a0 Two of our kids are the same age.\u00a0 We write about the same things. She quickly became a confidante.\u00a0 Someone I could bounce ideas off of.\u00a0 Someone that I could e-mail at 4am with a question or complaint, and I knew she\u2019d answer it.\u00a0 And \u201cget it\u201d.\u00a0 But we had never actually  spoken  to one another.\u00a0 Or connected in person. So when I read that she was going to be moving to the other side of the world this summer, I knew we had to meet.\u00a0 Somehow. We chose the day before Mother\u2019s Day to meet in Boston.\u00a0 She would fly up, I would drive in.\u00a0 It would be our day to just be\u2026us. ********** I had no idea what Spectrummy Mummy looked like or sounded like.\u00a0 However I know her kids\u2019 names, their diagnoses, and tiny details of her daily life.\u00a0 The weird thing about blogging friendships is that you get to learn the most intimate of details about the other person, but nothing superficial.\u00a0 It\u2019s the opposite of creating friendships in real life. I had it all planned out.\u00a0 I was going to get to the airport early, complete with my homemade \u201cSpectrummy Mummy\u201d sign to find her at the airport, and then I\u2019d whisk her into Boston on a grand sightseeing tour.\u00a0 She\u2019s British, so I planned to show her all the battlefields in the city where we beat her country.\u00a0\u00a0 I drove in to Boston, parked my car in a hotel garage, and headed for the bus to the airport. And I missed it.\u00a0 Only in Boston will a bus drive away as you\u2019re coming down the stairs to get on it. So instead of my grand \u201cWelcome to Boston\u201d plan at the airport, I had to send her a text that I was going to be late.\u00a0 Of course. ********** We hugged at the airport like old friends, and headed back into the city to Faneuil Hall.\u00a0 The conversation flowed so easily.\u00a0 The sun was shining, and we grabbed a lemonade and sat on a park bench.\u00a0 And talked.\u00a0 And talked. It was like we\u2019ve known each other for years.\u00a0 We talked about our kids.\u00a0 Our husbands.\u00a0 Our families.\u00a0 Our pre-kid lives. No awkward pauses.\u00a0 No kid interruptions.\u00a0 No phone calls from school.\u00a0 Nothing but just\u2026us. ********** Halfway through our lemonades, I looked across the plaza.\u00a0 A group of well dressed people were gathering in front of the entrance to the marketplace.\u00a0 I knew why there were there.\u00a0 Our senior senator, Senator John Kerry, was having a town meeting inside.\u00a0 It was open to the public.\u00a0 All you had to do was sign in. I had been told about this by some friends and it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do some autism awareness and advocacy.\u00a0 After all, we were already there.\u00a0 We were autism moms.\u00a0 And as I told my friends, you can take the moms away from their children with autism, but you can\u2019t take the autism out of their kids.\u00a0 Or something like that. The night before I had rehearsed my question for the Senator in my head. \n Senator Kerry, can you state whether or not you\u2019re committed to the reauthorization of the  combating autism act ?\u00a0 Can we talk more about our military families and the high incidence of autism amongst  military children ?\u00a0 Can you tell me why my  friend\u2019s husband  has to leave her family again so soon after returning from a long tour?\u00a0 How can we help my other friend, who is at home putting together her son\u2019s IEP while her husband is in Afghanistan?\u00a0 What supports can we give them so he\u2019s not worried about his child at home while protecting his country? \n \n I turned to Spectrummy Mummy.\u00a0 \u201cDo you want to go in?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d I stood for a minute and watched the people file in. I couldn\u2019t do it. I was definitely intimidated, that is true.\u00a0 But I was also tired of fighting.\u00a0 This was my one day that was just me and my friend.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t do it. At that moment, I didn\u2019t want to be an autism mom.\u00a0\u00a0 I just wanted to be\u2026me. ********** We ate at a restaurant where we didn\u2019t care about the ingredients.\u00a0 We watched a street performer demonstrate the changing of the guard (which was quite amusing to Spectrummy Mummy, her being British and all).\u00a0 We debated the merits of spending $12 for a half dozen cookies.\u00a0 We took a picture with a Storm Trooper outside of Newbury Comics. Spectrummy Mummy, Storm Trooper, Me. Need more proof that I'm not a \"hugger\"? Look at all that space between me and the Storm Trooper (photo credit: some random tourist) When the skies opened up and the rain poured down, we ran back inside Quincy Market for cake and hot chocolate.\u00a0 And sat on the floor. No worries about kids running off.\u00a0 No anxiety about the loud noises of the giant crowd taking refuge inside with us.\u00a0 Just\u2026us. ********** My plan of taking Spectrummy Mummy on a tour of the city scrapped because of the rain, we headed over to the Seaport Hotel to meet up with Varda from  The Squashed Bologna .\u00a0 She was there for a blogging conference, and it\u2019s where I had parked my car.\u00a0 It seemed like the perfect last stop before taking my friend back to the airport.\u00a0 We sat in the hotel bar with Varda, drank a bottle of wine, and talked some more. Varda and me. She looks much more rested than I do. (photo credit: Spectrummy Mummy) Our only time constraint was getting to the airport on time for Spectrummy Mummy\u2019s flight.\u00a0 We had nowhere else to be.\u00a0 We talked about our writing.\u00a0 Our plans for the future.\u00a0 Plans for our kid\u2019s future.\u00a0 I debated spending $7 for chocolate covered pretzels. And then, it was time to go. A ten minute ride to the airport, three hugs goodbye, and my new/old friend was gone.\u00a0 And I fought back tears the whole ride home. ********** Online friendships can be tricky.\u00a0 When you read someone\u2019s work for so long, you picture what they could be like in person.\u00a0 You\u2019re so in awe of all that they do, and so inspired by what they write and say, you wonder if you could even be in the same room as them, let alone spend the day together. I have been lucky enough to meet some of my fellow autism blogging friends in recent months and now count them among my best friends.\u00a0 These people I can count on to have my back in an instant. I can now include Spectrummy Mummy in that group of my best friends.\u00a0 The day we spent together was one of the best I had had in a long time.\u00a0 It was the first day in almost a year that I had just been\u2026me. There\u2019s a special connection that autism moms have.\u00a0 An instant bond.\u00a0 An total understanding.\u00a0 And no matter our backgrounds or our beliefs or the specifics of our child\u2019s diagnosis, we have a common ground.\u00a0 We \u201cget it\u201d.\u00a0 We\u2019re here for each other.\u00a0 Helping each other to bring out the \u201cjust me\u201d. From down the street or across the globe.

Probably because my emotions are all over the place.\u00a0 Today is the last Friday of preschool, and I\u2019m just back from our final monthly parent meeting at the school. Next stop, kindergarten. There\u2019s no question that Howie\u2019s ready.\u00a0 We went over his last preschool progress report and reviewed all his goals and objectives.\u00a0 He\u2019s where he needs to be.\u00a0 His teachers have created a fantastic transition plan for him, and the staff at the elementary school is well aware of his challenges and his strengths.\u00a0 They are ready for us to be there. But I\u2019m not ready to leave this school. This is the  school  where it all started for us.\u00a0 The school that took us in when things were going so wrong.\u00a0 The place where we realized that we needed to get Howie evaluated and get him services.\u00a0 The staff that held my hand every step of the way during all those evaluations.\u00a0 The people who introduced me to the words \u201csocial story\u201d and \u201capplied behavior analysis\u201d and \u201csensory diet\u201d.\u00a0 The teachers who became  partners  in ensuring Howie\u2019s success. We were at a breaking point when we started two and a half years ago.\u00a0 Things could have gone so badly.\u00a0 But instead\u2026 Everything has gone so right. Clearly, I fear change.\u00a0 I\u2019m not afraid to admit it.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not that the new school is bad.\u00a0 In fact, it\u2019s wonderful.\u00a0 My oldest goes there now.\u00a0 I know it will all be okay.

In our meeting today, Howie\u2019s teacher reminded me that \u201cchange is growth\u201d.\u00a0 She was talking about Howie, of course, but she was speaking to me as well. When Howie started at the school, he looked like this: And now he looks like this: My friends and I joke that we\u2019re in a constant state of being proud and scared with our kids.\u00a0 With every accomplishment they have, it leads to the next stage of challenges and hurdles.\u00a0 I\u2019m so proud and amazed by all that he has done in these few short years.\u00a0 I\u2019m also scared out of my mind about what comes next.

{"date": "September 2, 2011", "body": "This week has been\u2026hard.\u00a0 Very very hard. My kids were supposed to start school this past Tuesday.\u00a0 But Hurricane Irene left her mark here, knocking out power to most of my town and dropping trees and power lines across roads and bridges.\u00a0 The buses simply could not get through, and so school was canceled on Tuesday.\u00a0 And Wednesday. And Thursday. Each day we shuffled around our planned \u201cgetting ready for the first day of school\u201d activities, and each afternoon the call came in that school was put off for another day. I hit the parenting wall.\u00a0 Hard. My kids were becoming difficult.\u00a0 Lewis had become quite aggressive and impossible to manage around his brothers.\u00a0 Howie\u2019s stimming and crashing and smashing was hitting intolerable levels.\u00a0 Gerry was at the end of his rope with his brothers.\u00a0 And no amount of extra beach trips and surprise playdates made any of it easier or better. I was done.\u00a0 I had lost control of everything in the house.\u00a0 I had lost control of my ability to function. Enter in my lifelines.\u00a0 My autism mom friends. I\u2019m lucky enough to have met some incredible  women  over these past few years.\u00a0 Some of them I\u2019ve met through my son\u2019s  school , some I\u2019ve met through reading their  blogs .\u00a0 Some I just know through Facebook and Twitter. Each and every one of them is just\u2026 incredible. Beyond nice.\u00a0 Instantly supportive. Every visit and conversation is easy.\u00a0 Like we\u2019ve been friends for years. I know how cliche it sounds.\u00a0 But it is so very true. They just \u201cget it\u201d without explanation or judgement.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have to pretend to be some strong \u201cI-can-handle-anything\u201d mother with them. I can send an e-mail saying \u201cI\u2019m losing it.\u00a0 Sitting at my desk trying not to cry.\u201d\u00a0 They don\u2019t think I\u2019m on the verge of a nervous breakdown.\u00a0 They say \u201cThat was me last week.\u201d I can write that \u201cthe hurricane is wreaking havoc on all three of my kids and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\u00a0 They don\u2019t wonder why the weather is affecting my children.\u00a0 They say \u201cit\u2019s happening in my house too.\u201d I can send an instant message that \u201cI\u2019m struggling.\u00a0 Losing myself and my family in the process.\u201d\u00a0 They don\u2019t question my parenting ability.\u00a0 They offer to babysit, tell me to set up a date night and help me feel human again.\u00a0 And when I tell them how bad it really is, they say \u201cI can handle it.\u00a0 You need the break.\u201d I can ask for their support and strength as \u201cI\u2019m trying not to cancel our babysitter for the night because my kids are so volatile I\u2019m afraid of putting our friend in the position of policing them all night.\u201d\u00a0 They don\u2019t even ask what is going on with my kids.\u00a0 They tell me \u201cYou need this night out.\u00a0 Get out of your house or I will kick your a**.\u201d And I can post on my  Facebook  page that I\u2019m looking for ideas to entertain my kids now that we\u2019re delayed for a week, and a  mom  invites me to their swim club.\u00a0 To get out for the day.\u00a0 Without ever having met me or my children before. They were the ones to lift me up and pull me out of the rabbit hole. Without these women, I wouldn\u2019t be the advocate that I am today for my children \u2013 all three of them.\u00a0 Without them, I wouldn\u2019t be the parent that I am today. Without them, I\u2019m not even sure I would have made it out of bed this week. They not only get my kids, but they \u201cget\u201d me. A while ago, my friend Jess wrote a post called \u201c Autism Street \u201d about how different autism can be from one house to another.\u00a0 She reminded us that what happens behind the closed doors in my house on autism street is very different than what is behind my neighbors\u2019 closed doors.\u00a0 And with that, we need to support each other no matter what. It\u2019s a phrase I\u2019ve used often since in an attempt to describe an \u201cin real life\u201d version of this virtual autism community.\u00a0 Online, we are instantly there for one another without judgement or qualification.\u00a0 My parenting struggles in my house are just as valid as the parenting struggles faced by another. Our children are all different and on different \u201cplaces\u201d on the spectrum, but as a group we celebrate our huge successes and cry at the bittersweet. We are in this together. In real life, I can imagine this \u201cplace\u201d where\u00a0 we watch each other\u2019s kids with no questions asked.\u00a0 A park where our kids could roam free and be free without the \u201clook\u201d.\u00a0 A gazebo where the siblings could hang together, swapping tunes on their iPods and gaining strength from each other.\u00a0 A place where the virtual \u201chugs\u201d could become real and the doors are always open. A welcoming village for anyone who \u201cgets\u201d our kids \u2013 autism parent or not. A bridge over that troubled water for us all. This week will be better for my house on autism street.\u00a0 It has to be.\u00a0 Then it will be my turn to open my doors for my neighbors, to give back what they have given to me. \u201c When you\u2019re weary \n  Feeling small \n  When tears are in your eyes \n  I will dry them all  I\u2019m on your side  When times get rough \n  And friends just can\u2019t be found \n  Like a bridge over troubled water \n  I will lay me down \n  Like a bridge over troubled water \n  I will lay me down \u201d \u2013 Bridge Over Troubled Water by Paul Simon ********** As hard hit as my town was by Hurricane Irene, it does not compare to the devastation that occurred in my home state of Vermont.\u00a0 Please click  HERE  to donate to the Vermont Food Bank\u2019s disaster relief and help those in need.

This is my story. When I started at school, I looked like this: and now I look like this: When I started, being in the classroom was very hard for me. But I learned to use my ready body and do my work nicely. At first, I had a hard time using a pencil and crayon to write and draw. My teachers taught me how to \u201cpinch and pull back\u201d.\u00a0 I can write and color perfectly . It was hard for me to figure out how to join in with other kids. But now I can spend more time working with my friends in the classroom. Controlling my emotions was very hard. But now I can have fun at the playground and meet up with my friends there. My teachers helped me every day.\u00a0 They taught me how to use my brave words and how to solve my problems myself. My teachers held my hand so I would not fall.\u00a0 They taught me how to try new things.\u00a0 They loved me for me. When I started at preschool, I was a little boy. But I have grown so much. I have learned so much. I\u2019m now a big kid. My tool box is filling up every day. Thank you to all of my teachers.

{"date": "September 19, 2011", "body": "I found my place yesterday. For a long time I\u2019ve been searching for that one special place.\u00a0 Somewhere where my kids could just \u201cbe\u201d.\u00a0 No judging eyes.\u00a0 No sideways stares.\u00a0 They could run and play and laugh and spin and be themselves without any worry or thought about who was around them. We found that yesterday at  Colt State Park in Bristol, RI . We were there for the  Southern New England Walk for Autism Speaks .\u00a0 Our team of 22 \u2013 13 adults and 9 kids \u2013 came together for a cause:\u00a0 to raise money to support research and awareness for people living with autism spectrum disorder. What we came away with was so much more. The one mile loop took us through this magnificent park on a trail that started in a forest and ended along the ocean.\u00a0 We walked at first as one big group, taking pictures and remarking on the beauty of the day. We chased after each other\u2019s kids and held their hands along the ocean rocks.\u00a0\u00a0 The kids ran and then stopped to pick up seashells.\u00a0 Our kids could walk beside us.\u00a0 Hand in hand if they wanted.\u00a0 Or not. hand in hand - no complaints! We stopped when our kids wanted to stop.\u00a0 We did what they wanted to do.\u00a0 We were on no one else\u2019s time schedule but our own. At the halfway point, we were cheered on by some local high school boys.\u00a0 They gave our kids high fives, handed them each a lei, and told them they were doing a great job. Our kids high-fived them back, accepted their new treasure, and ran on.\u00a0 Free. It was at that moment that I knew I\u2019d found it. This was  the place . No judgement, no worries.\u00a0 Safe and secure but free to be themselves.\u00a0 Jumping, stimming, yelling, running, dancing, spinning, signing, scripting\u2026laughing.\u00a0 Siblings, parents, uncles, cousins, and friends \u2013 all together in one big group watching out for each other.\u00a0 Having fun. Dancing to the band quiet sibling times so much room to run and play Just being ourselves. For me, it quickly became one of the best days I\u2019ve ever had. We arrived separately : my friend who came with her two boys just because she cares, my uncle and cousins and their daughter who where there to support us, my mother who would do anything for her grandsons, my friend (my son\u2019s former teacher) who understands our kids better than any person I have ever met, and my three autism mom friends and their boys \u2026who spent the whole day smiling\u2026 Our team of 22 became a family of one. The day was no longer about the disorder that can pull our families apart.\u00a0 This day was about hope, friendship, and creating a family that supports each other no matter what. I walked that day wearing a pin given to me by  one amazing friend .\u00a0 It was from the  Brady Rymer Band. It said \u201cLove Me For Who I Am \u201c. In this place, our kids \u2013 ALL of them \u2013 were loved for who they were. love me for who I am That gives me a new spring in my step.

In June, two word sentences were hard to understand.\u00a0 He could label, but not complete phrases.\u00a0 Many consonant sounds were missing.\u00a0 No subject-verb configurations.\u00a0 And as their sessions went on, other things became apparent.\u00a0 Limited play skills.\u00a0 No eye contact.\u00a0 Difficulty maintaining attention.\u00a0 That all brought us to August and our developmental evaluation and the eventual  PDD-NOS diagnosis .

{"date": "September 26, 2011", "body": "This is a post in two parts. Part One: September 25, 2011 Watch out.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to whine. Today was the  12th Annual Flutie Foundation 5K. \u00a0 It\u2019s a race I ran last year.\u00a0 My first 5K ever. It was also the last time my running shoes were on my feet. I have a lot of friends who ran today.\u00a0 Friends I ran with last year and some friends running it for the first time today.\u00a0 When they signed up for the race, my name was included on the e-mails about registration, carpooling, etc. Each time I wrote back that I wouldn\u2019t be there. My friends were awesome, even threatening to kidnap me out of the house and train with me.\u00a0 I laughed, knowing that they were only partly kidding.\u00a0  I want to , I\u2019d say,  but I just can\u2019t. I had a million excuses.\u00a0 It was too hot or too cold.\u00a0 I had no childcare.\u00a0 I had no sleep. Truth is, I just couldn\u2019t get myself out of the house.\u00a0 I was stuck.\u00a0 Paralyzed again by everything that had happened this year.\u00a0 Strapping on my running shoes just didn\u2019t seem like the answer.\u00a0 I was just too tired. I struggled with this every time they would run by the house or saw their daily run times posts on Facebook.\u00a0 These were autism moms too.\u00a0 How are they not tired like me?\u00a0 What is getting them up and out to run when it\u2019s all I can do to just get up and out of bed? As the race date got closer and closer, I got more and more depressed.\u00a0 Here was a foundation I believed in \u2013 an  organization founded by Doug Flutie  in honor of his son \u2013 doing amazing work in our community.\u00a0 They give out  grants to school districts and organizations  to help kids just like mine.\u00a0 I had even planned to approach our school to help apply for one of those grants to get a social skills group in our community. I couldn\u2019t even find time to work on that grant.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t find the time to do anything this year. Running that race  last October  was the last thing I remember doing just for me.\u00a0 It was my accomplishment and mine alone.\u00a0 I trained for that run alone.\u00a0 My kids were proud of me, and still talk about it. Like \u201cRemember when Mom ran that race and didn\u2019t win?\u00a0 She still got a T-shirt!\u201d It was my Hopeful Parents post for  October 2010 . What have I done since then?\u00a0 For me? Yes, I know I have been taking care of three amazing children, each with their own demands on my time.\u00a0 Since that race, we received one more autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, transitioned one kid to kindergarten, and discovered new anxieties and worries in our fourth grader.\u00a0 I\u2019ve walked the dog several hundred times, cleaned up the same Hot Wheels cars a thousand times, and stared at piles of laundry for days. But the only accomplishment that I can point to that was just for me was completing all the levels on Angry Birds.\u00a0 And even that, Tim helped me. Seeing the race photos today from my friends hit me harder than I thought it would.\u00a0 On each of them I wrote:\u00a0 YAY!\u00a0 Good for you! \u00a0 and  So sad I wasn\u2019t there with you today. I need to get back the \u201csomething just for me\u201d.\u00a0 It may not be running at this point.\u00a0 But it has to be something.\u00a0 This \u201cnothing\u201d\u2026just isn\u2019t working. Part Two: September 26, 2011 I put two kids on their buses.\u00a0 Took one kid to preschool. I went to the closet and pulled out my running shoes, grabbed my iPod and headphones, and headed out the door. The air was thick with heat and humidity already.\u00a0 I clicked through to my running playlist. The opening notes to \u201cHannah Jane\u201d by Hootie and the Blowfish filled my ears.\u00a0 And off I went. A jog.\u00a0 A slow slow jog.\u00a0 Down the sidewalk, avoiding the cracks and the acorns and the fallen branches.\u00a0 Behind me, toilets that needed to be cleaned, a floor that hasn\u2019t been washed in weeks, and dishes that needed to be put away. In front of me, nothing. I was alone, just me and my music.\u00a0 Together again for the first time in a year. It\u2019s not the solution to my problems.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a start. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I have sore feet to soak.\u00a0 And a bruised self-esteem to fix. ********** Click  HERE  to learn more about the Doug Flutie, Jr. Foundation for Autism and all the great work they do.\u00a0 They are involved in this cool project called \u201c Hacking Autism \u201c, working together with Autism Speaks and Hewlett-Packard to  create new apps for people living with autism .

It had been a challenging morning, to say the least.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if the kids were out of sorts because  I had been away , or if maybe I was the one out-of-sync.\u00a0 But Howie was up at 5am and had been verbally stimming and non-compliant all morning.\u00a0 He refused to get dressed/put on his coat/get in the van.\u00a0 Lewis woke up shortly after Howie left, and the pattern continued.\u00a0 Wouldn\u2019t eat, wouldn\u2019t get dressed.\u00a0 No coat, no car.\u00a0 We were 10 minutes late for preschool and I left him screaming outside his classroom with the teacher, still refusing to hang up his backpack. The ugly cry was my company on the way home. I had finally pulled it together enough to make myself coffee, eat an entire row of cinnamon rolls, shower, and get back for preschool pickup. At home twenty minutes later, the song came on. I was sitting on the floor, glasses off, crying. \u201cWhy you glasses out?\u201d Lewis had come around the corner, a pile of Hot Wheels cars in his hand.\u00a0 I quickly tried to wipe away the tears. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He was pointing to one stray tear coming down my cheek. \u201cI will wipe it.\u00a0 I get paper towel.\u201d He went into the kitchen and grabbed a whole roll of paper towels, ripping off several sheets. Gently, he touched my cheek. \u201cThere.\u00a0 Alllll better.\u201d And it was. I have a week that includes a special education parent advisory meeting tonight, Lewis\u2019 first IEP meeting at 9am tomorrow morning, his 3 year old checkup an hour later, and our first monthly kindergarten parent/teacher meeting for Howie directly after that.\u00a0 Wednesday the kids have no school.\u00a0 Thursday we meet with a psychologist to determine what, if any, testing we need to do with Gerry. Friday is Lewis\u2019 third birthday.\u00a0 And if you have a kid with special needs, you know what that milestone means.\u00a0 No more early intervention.\u00a0 Fully in the hands of the school system.\u00a0 No more wondering if this is a phase that you won\u2019t have to share.\u00a0 It\u2019s real. But that simple gesture of wiping my tears\u2026 Reminded me of why this week is so important. My kids need me to be their best advocate this week so that in turn they can show the world the wonders that I see here at home. My kids \u2013 all three \u2013 are counting on me.\u00a0 That takes the sad right out of me. \u201c It\u2019s all right to cry \n  Crying gets the sad out of you \n  It\u2019s all right to cry \n  It might make you feel better  Raindrops from your eyes \n  Washing all the mad out of you \n  Raindrops from your eyes \n  It\u2019s gonna make you feel better .\u201d \u2013 It\u2019s All Right To Cry by Rosey Grier (from Free To Be You And Me) \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/closer-to-fine-at-hopeful-parents/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/its-all-right-to-cry/", "title": "\n\t\t\tIt\u2019s All Right To\u00a0Cry\t\t"},

{"date": "September 7, 2011", "body": "\n Within minutes of each other, I had a kindergartener and a fourth grader whisked off to school. And one screaming two year old at the window, desperate to go with them.\u00a0 \u2013 My personal Facebook page status today \n I put my son on the van this morning at 7:35am for his very first day of kindergarten. We took the obligatory pictures in the rain to document this momentous occasion. I went back inside to post them on Facebook, like everyone else was doing. And I couldn\u2019t do it. My son\u2019s first day didn\u2019t look like the other kids\u2019 first day.\u00a0 There was no walk over to the big yellow school bus, no wave from the window as he drove away. We were on the van. Last year, I wrote a post for Hopeful Parents called \u201c The Wheels on the Bus \u201c.\u00a0 It was my first post about my public acceptance of my son\u2019s diagnosis.\u00a0 I said \u201cI\u2019ve grown comfortable sharing our story in town and now I am happy to have The Van pull into my driveway.\u00a0 Just like every other new specialized service we\u2019ve added to my son\u2019s routine, it has only made life better for him and for all of us.\u201d And all of that is still true.\u00a0 But today, I felt a little sad. Years ago, before everything, I promised Howie that he could ride the big yellow bus like his brother.\u00a0 As time went on, it became clear that he just couldn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 The sounds, the smells, the noises and the long ride to and from school would just be too much for my little guy.\u00a0 Putting him on the bus would be setting him up for failure immediately. So we\u2019re on the van. I put the memory card away with all the pictures, and focused on having my alone time with Lewis.\u00a0 As he and I vacuumed together, I had a 180 degree turn. I\u2019m proud of those photos.\u00a0 And I have to post them. He\u2019s on the van with his friends and a  driver who loves him .\u00a0 He\u2019s traveling to school in the way that is not only appropriate for him, but perfect for him.\u00a0 He\u2019s greeted by his aide when he arrives at school, and sent on his way home the same way.\u00a0 He is taken care of every step of the way from the moment he steps into that building until he walks in our house. We have worked incredibly hard to get to this point, and I\u2019m not going to let some silly notion of what things are \u201csupposed to be\u201d stand in our way of celebrating this day. This is our normal.\u00a0 I have one son on the bus and one on the van.\u00a0 Our first day pictures may look different, but it doesn\u2019t make them any less amazing and important. So here, for the first time, is my son going to kindergarten. I am so proud of him. \u201cThe wheels on the bus go \u2019round and \u2019round \u2019round and \u2019round \u2019round and \u2019round.

{"date": "September 10, 2011", "body": "Really?\u00a0 I should know better by now. Yesterday at school, Howie fell down at recess and tore up his knee.\u00a0 According to the school nurse (and his aide who carried him off the playground, to the nurse\u2019s office, to lunch and back to the nurse), it was bleeding pretty heavily, and understandably Howie was very upset.\u00a0 Every time they tried to come near him, he let out blood curdling screams (no pun intended).\u00a0 I picked him up just before noon and brought him home.\u00a0 To scream here. Thanks to some incredible TLC from Tim, we were able to remove the band-aid to determine that it didn\u2019t need stitches.\u00a0 Tim wrapped it up with gauze and tape to make a better feeling \u2013 and less sticky \u2013 bandage to protect it.\u00a0 Howie called it his \u201ccast\u201d. He seemed in good spirits this morning, so we continued with our plans to attend our town\u2019s \u201cDay in the Park\u201d celebration.\u00a0 It\u2019s an annual event in our town park with music, food, games, crafts and lots of activities for the kids.\u00a0 This year, our town was having a birthday parade as well. And again I say to myself: Really?\u00a0 I should know better by now. The five of us trooped to the park and within minutes I realized I\u2019d made a mistake.\u00a0 Three bounce houses.\u00a0 A playground full of kids.\u00a0 All things that Howie couldn\u2019t do with his bad knee. Cue meltdown in 3\u20262\u20261\u2026 The first one came as we walked past the bounce house.\u00a0 We\u2019d managed to do one quick tractor ride and a game before we walked by it. The explanation of \u201cyou could hurt your knee again\u201d was met with \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t hurt now.\u201d\u00a0 Howie just does not get the cause and effect relationship, especially when it comes to pain.\u00a0 If it is not happening in the moment, it can\u2019t happen.\u00a0 It just doesn\u2019t compute to him. I led him away as he was shrieking and hitting me. The only way we moved on was by me telling him that if a kid fell on him in the bounce house, he could start bleeding again like at recess.\u00a0 I basically scared the crap out of him. I tried to redirect him to activities we could do.\u00a0 When we stopped to talk with one of his new kindergarten aides, he spied the playground. I let him go on some of the equipment, but tried to keep him off anything he had to climb or run on.\u00a0 You know, about 90% of the things there. Once I saw him attempt the rope ladder and shimmy his way across the platform to the monkey bars, I knew he had to come down or risk more injuries. Cue meltdown #2 in 3\u20262\u20261. With him yelling and kicking and jumping, we made our way over to a shady tree so we could watch the parade.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t sit, he wouldn\u2019t stand, he wouldn\u2019t leave. The parade came in three waves down the street, starting with the fire trucks and police motorcycles.\u00a0 Howie couldn\u2019t understand why some kids were in the fire trucks and he couldn\u2019t. I was trying to talk to the mom of one of Gerry\u2019s best friends.\u00a0 Howie head-butted me in the stomach. Then the marching band came and he was upset that there was no tuba. Howie whined that he was thirsty and wanted juice.\u00a0 I offered lemonade.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t like the smell.\u00a0 I started to talk to one of Howie\u2019s former teachers.\u00a0 He turned around and tried to poke me in the eye. Finally, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts came by.\u00a0 When he recognized some kids from his school walking by, he asked why he couldn\u2019t march as well.\u00a0 When I explained that the scouts were part of the parade, he completely fell apart. Punching me.\u00a0 Kicking me. Gerry went off with his friend.\u00a0 I turned to Tim and said we had to go. I carried Howie from the shady tree around the park and back to the car.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure half the town heard him scream \u201cI HATE YOU MOM!\u201d while he hit me on the shoulders.\u00a0 If the Beatles revival band hadn\u2019t been singing \u201cShe Loves You Yeah Yeah Yeah\u201d at the time, every eye in the park would have been on us. Thing is, I\u2019m sure he just looked like a spoiled kid who was mad that we were leaving the park before he was ready. I knew he was in full sensory meltdown mode.\u00a0 There was no punishment necessary.\u00a0 His body was punishing him enough. Once we were home, in the comfort of his green chair, with juice and \u201cRio\u201d on the TV, he was calm.\u00a0 He sat sideways on the chair with his leg up.\u00a0 He asked for more juice about 4 times.\u00a0 And about 30 hugs. He\u2019s resting comfortably now. Again, I ask myself : really?\u00a0 I should know better by now.\u00a0 I forget sometimes because we have come so far.\u00a0 The things \u2013 like Day in the Park \u2013 that we used to avoid, we can do now. But not today. If I could, I\u2019d rewrite today\u2019s plan.\u00a0 I would have sent just Gerry to the park with Tim or maybe called a friend.\u00a0 I would have stayed home with Howie or gone for a ride to a place where he didn\u2019t have to use his leg.\u00a0 I would have ignored the voice in my head saying \u201ceveryone in town will be there, we can\u2019t miss it\u201d and gone with \u201cit\u2019s just not right for us today.\u201d But I can\u2019t go change it. Instead, I\u2019ll go with next time I\u2019ll know better. \u201c Yeah\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0workin\u2019 on\u00a0my\u00a0rewrite,\u00a0all\u00a0right  \n Gonna\u00a0change\u00a0my\u00a0ending  \n Throw\u00a0away\u00a0the\u00a0title  \n Toss\u00a0it\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0trash  \n Every\u00a0minute\u00a0after\u00a0midnight  \n All\u00a0the\u00a0Time\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0spending  \n Is\u00a0just\u00a0for\u00a0workin\u2019on\u00a0my\u00a0rewrite.  \n Gonna\u00a0turn\u00a0it\u00a0into\u00a0cash  \u201d \u2013 Rewrite by Paul Simon \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/09/10/rewrite/", "title": "\n\t\t\tRewrite\t\t"},

{"date": "September 15, 2011", "body": "At daycare, he was the one I brought in clinging to my leg.\u00a0 The one crying, asking me not to leave.\u00a0 The one the teachers said would stand outside the circle of kids, watching, until he was ready to join in. In preschool, he stayed next to me and the other parents while his classmates ran around on the grass, chasing each other before school started.\u00a0 Eventually, he\u2019d join in, but stopped immediately when the teacher came to the door, calling the kids inside.\u00a0 He was also the one reading the books aloud with the teacher at circle time.\u00a0 The one who brought in a globe for show-and-tell. In kindergarten, he was the one who cried when he was the last one to complete a paper because he had to get it just right.\u00a0 He was terrified of raising his hand for fear of giving the wrong answer.\u00a0 But he was also the one who gave the right answer all the time.\u00a0 The one who had the glowing report card from the start.\u00a0 The model of good behavior for the other kids. In first and second grade, he was the one who wowed his teacher with his knowledge.\u00a0 He read every book she offered to him, and encouraged his love of history and science.\u00a0 He mastered every subject with ease.\u00a0 But he was also the one who obsessed on his handwriting and not the content of his work.\u00a0 The one who played with a friend or two at recess but didn\u2019t join in the group.\u00a0 The one who needed his dad to coach his baseball team to build his confidence. In third grade, he was the one who was happy about the extra work sent home from the teacher.\u00a0 He did math puzzles and read extra pages at night and wrote about them in his journal.\u00a0 He was the one who taught the other kids how to make origami Yodas during inside recess.\u00a0 But he was also the one who had an anxiety attack about the school\u2019s standardized assessment tests, to the point where he needed to meet with the guidance counselor.\u00a0 He obsessed over not getting every answer right.\u00a0 And he was also the one with a just few very good friends.\u00a0 The one invited to only a few birthday parties. He\u2019s shy.\u00a0 Brilliant.\u00a0 Quiet.\u00a0 Sensitive. An old soul.\u00a0  The kid every parent wants their kids to be friends with . We are now here in fourth grade.\u00a0 Things are a little different. Last night before bed, Gerry told me he couldn\u2019t go to school.\u00a0  I have a stomach ache , he said,  and my leg hurts . Having been there before, I asked him what was really going on.\u00a0 Every night since school finally started, there has been something new keeping him awake.\u00a0 Up four times a night.\u00a0 Hot and cold.\u00a0 Worried about this and that.\u00a0 Confidence in the toilet. Unsettled. Unable to complete his homework or piano assignments unless either Tim or I are in the room with him. I\u2019m bored in school , he said. I pressed him further, knowing this was far from the truth. Sigh.\u00a0 I can\u2019t focus, okay?\u00a0 I sit there. I want to pay attention but I can\u2019t.\u00a0 I start to daydream and I\u2019m thinking about the Star Wars Clone Wars website, and then about Open House night and then picture day.\u00a0 I go deaf.\u00a0 I don\u2019t hear the other kids around me anymore.\u00a0 When I come back, I\u2019ve missed the whole math lesson.\u00a0 I can\u2019t tune in to anything around me.\u00a0 I have a very full life and my brain can\u2019t shut it off to concentrate on magic math squares. And up go my red flags. I know the kid has a lot on his plate.\u00a0 To say things around here are anything but stressful would be a lie.\u00a0 Back to school has been a challenge for us all.\u00a0 His brother is in his school for the first time.\u00a0  Rides in on a different bus .\u00a0 Runs in different circles \u2013 literally.\u00a0 Our house has become a revolving door of therapists for both his brothers. His anxiety about everything is not new.\u00a0 If I can be honest, he\u2019s a lot like me there . But the focus thing is completely new.\u00a0 This is the first time he\u2019s expected to really pay attention in class.\u00a0 There\u2019s no hand holding anymore. I had a brief conversation with a neighbor about it this morning.\u00a0 Her middle son started having his attention issues in fourth grade as well.  He was so smart, s he said , that he had been able to get by on his intellect up to that point.\u00a0 But fourth grade, everything changed.\u00a0 Add in hormones and friend issues\u2026these kids have a lot going on.\u00a0 We\u2019ve started now with anger management problems too.\u00a0 He thinks that his youngest brother gets everything and he gets nothing. Yes, my neighbor\u2019s youngest son is on the autism spectrum.\u00a0 Just like in our house. I don\u2019t know where this will all go for Gerry, but I know that I owe it to him to find out.\u00a0 He needs a safe space to go to get it all out.\u00a0 To figure out what is real and what is perceived worry.\u00a0 To get his focus issues under control before they throw us all out of control. My friend wrote about  worry  in her post over at Diary of A Mom.\u00a0 It hit home. Hard. So today we have an appointment with our pediatrician to get things started.\u00a0 And tonight\u2019s at his school\u2019s Open House, I\u2019ll feel out the teacher to see how she can help in the classroom.\u00a0 Immediately. I worry about all my kids, but Gerry\u2026 I need to take his troubles away. To get that shy, brilliant, amazing kid back out. I\u2019ll help you figure this out,  I told him last night.\u00a0  Don\u2019t worry. I love you, Mom.\u00a0 Thank you.

I\u2019m using their free wi-fi, drinking a cup of coffee.\u00a0 One empty plate sits next to me.\u00a0 It used to hold an egg and cheese sandwich. I\u2019m alone.\u00a0 For the first time in almost three years, it\u2019s 10am and I\u2019m completely alone. Gerry is at baseball camp.\u00a0 Howie is at his extended school year summer program. And my little two-and-a-half year old Lewis?\u00a0 He\u2019s at his first early intervention drop-off playgroup. He qualified for it because he\u2019s now receiving home speech services.\u00a0 It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever left him\u2026anywhere. Last night I sent some friends a message on Facebook: \n So Lewis starts his first EI drop off group tomorrow. On one hand, this will be the first alone time I\u2019ve had in 2 1/2 years. On the other hand, I really wish he wasn\u2019t eligible to go to an EI drop off group. \n My friends had the best responses (of course): Totally hear you. But he\u2019s getting what he needs. That\u2019s a really, really good thing. And: He is getting what he needs and you can take a moment to breathe. Xo And: Big picture- he is getting what he needs and that alone is awesome. Bigger picture- YOU GET TIME ALONE!!!! Now hear me, woman\u2026listen good. Do NOT use that time to clean a damn thing. Get yourself a good book- FICTION or something else that interests you that is NOT about {autismspecialneedssensory\u200bprocessingdisorderearlyint\u200berventiontherapy} or anything like that. Take said book and get thyself to a Starbucks or a favorite cafe or lunch spot and \u2013 wait for it- LEISURELY sip a beverage of choice And: Go get a pedicure during your alone time. Oh, wait\u2026. ( that\u2019s from a friend who really knows how much I hate people touching my feet\u2026) So here I am.\u00a0 My kids are doing they things they need to do.\u00a0 Playing ball outside, making marshmallow men at summer school, and\u2026playing with kids their own age. And I\u2019m getting what I need too.\u00a0 Time to write.\u00a0 Time to drink my coffee before it goes cold.\u00a0 Perhaps even time to go to the bathroom alone.

Thinking I was rewarding them for behaving in the mall, we stopped at The Disney Store to window shop. \u201cI\u2019m not going in there, Momma!\u201d. Howie put the brakes on outside of the store.\u00a0 He would not take one step across the line that divided the mall corridor from the all-things-Mickey overload. Gerry was already in the store, about five feet from us.\u00a0 He\u2019s still conditioned to not be out of my sight in any store, even at nine years old.\u00a0 Lewis was practically falling out of the stroller, trying to get to the Lightning McQueen display. \u201cCome on\u201d, I said.\u00a0 \u201cIt will be okay.\u00a0 Look!\u00a0 There\u2019s Phineas and Ferb!\u201d \u201cNO!\u00a0 I\u2019m not going in there.\u201d\u00a0 Panic came across his face. Gerry turned to look at me, with eyes that said  what is taking so long??? \u00a0 Lewis started to wriggle and squirm his way out of his buckles. I looked right into Howie\u2019s eyes.\u00a0 They were fixated on the giant Mickey and Goofy suspended from the ceiling.\u00a0 I turned my head to them and caught the reflection of the huge projection TV that was in the back of the room.\u00a0 An ad for the next \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d was blaring from the speakers. He was being bombarded from every direction.\u00a0 Overwhelmed by sounds and sights. I bent down and gave him a squeeze.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d, I said.\u00a0 \u201cYou can do this.\u00a0 I\u2019ve got you.\u201d I picked him up and carried him into the store, pushing the stroller with my legs. He buried his head into my shoulder.\u00a0 His hands \u201ctunneled\u201d into my neck.\u00a0 I squished my head into his hands and brought him over the threshold. \u201cLook at all the Cars 2 stuff.\u201d I whispered into his ear. He slowly turned his head and looked. A few steps later at the Phineas and Ferb display, he slid down out of my arms.\u00a0 I tickled him with a Perry the Platypus doll.\u00a0 His infectious laugh filled the store. A smile came over his face as a commercial for \u201cDisney Junior\u201d came on the big TV.\u00a0 A familiar song, a familiar site. And all was calm. We spent fifteen minutes in the store. Just long enough to buy a new Phineas and Ferb beach ball like his friend has. Just long enough to overcome his fear. Just long enough to know that he was okay despite his sensory overload. My son went into The Disney Store.\u00a0 For most kids, this is an easy stroll they take all the time.\u00a0 For my kid, it was like climbing a mountain.\u00a0 And at the top, the view was nothing short of breathtaking. \"Good work, Agent P.\" (photo credit Wikipedia\u2019s \u201c perry the platypus \u201d page.

I\u2019m sitting outside of the preschool watching the playground.\u00a0 It\u2019s the second day of \u201cCircle Time Camp\u201d, the camp for all the kids attending preschool for the first time in the fall.\u00a0 I\u2019m watching Lewis.\u00a0 He\u2019s running around the yard, going up the ladder and down the slide, reaching his hands up high to hang from the monkey bars.\u00a0 When camp is over, he follows the other kids to the bench and waits for his name to be called to go home.\u00a0 He sits with his hands in his lap, nicely waiting his turn. What can\u2019t I see? On Monday, I\u2019ll be taking him for his developmental evaluation at a hospital in Boston.\u00a0 It\u2019s the appointment that I  canceled back in March , when my gut was telling me that there was nothing wrong.\u00a0 It\u2019s the appointment that I rescheduled after his early intervention speech pathologist  suggested that he needed to be evaluated .\u00a0 He\u2019ll be seen by a developmental pediatrician and a speech/language specialist.\u00a0 I\u2019ve filled out all the forms and arranged for child care for the other boys.\u00a0 We\u2019re actually going this time. But I don\u2019t want to go.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to hear what they have to say.\u00a0 I don\u2019t even know what to say to them. I have watched him carefully since I made the appointment, looking for red flags or something that makes me feel like the appointment isn\u2019t a waste of time.\u00a0 He has a speech delay.\u00a0 That I know.\u00a0 I\u2019m watching his eye contact, his pretend play, his transitions.\u00a0 I asked those who know him to tell me honestly what they see. They see my little guy.\u00a0 Nothing else. When we did this with Howie, I knew there was something wrong.\u00a0 Something \u201coff\u201d.\u00a0 I expected a PDD-NOS diagnosis.\u00a0 This time\u2026what is it? This appointment is making me question everything I know as a parent.\u00a0 He was my surprise baby.\u00a0 I have watched him like a hawk since day one.\u00a0 Checking off the milestones on the list, including all the ones his brother missed.\u00a0 He\u2019s my eater.\u00a0 My sleeper. My buddy. \u201cMom?\u00a0 How come all the other little kids at the  family reunion  could say their G sounds better than Lewis?\u00a0 Is it because Howie doesn\u2019t use his right words and he\u2019s copying him?\u00a0 Or is there something wrong with Lewis too?\u201d\u00a0 My oldest\u2019s words swirl around my head. I\u2019m not only challenged with figuring out if his behavior is that of a typical 2 1/2 year old or if there\u2019s something developmental different about him.\u00a0 I\u2019m also challenged with determining if it\u2019s learned behavior from his big brother. I\u2019m the one who called Early Intervention three times to come out.\u00a0 I\u2019m the one who knew that he wasn\u2019t talking like he was \u201csupposed to\u201d.\u00a0 How could I be missing seeing something else?\u00a0 How many more labels will be added to the end of this child\u2019s name? I know the labels don\u2019t change him.\u00a0 I have said it a million times to friends, family and other parents across the internet.\u00a0 The label does not make him anything else but who he is.\u00a0 All it does is get us the help he needs.\u00a0 That we need. It\u2019s easy to say.\u00a0 Not easy to remember. It won\u2019t matter what they tell me.\u00a0 I\u2019m going in with an amazing, smart, funny little two year old and I\u2019ll be coming home with the same kid.

We had two weeks off between the end of the school year and the beginning of our summer school program.\u00a0 The first week I knew we were going to fill with our  Story Land  trip.\u00a0 But the second week?\u00a0 Plan-less. Cue panic. Three boys home.\u00a0 Three boys who were not used to spending this much time together.\u00a0 Three boys with nothing to do but crash into each other. I had low expectations for how the week was going to go.\u00a0 Scratch that.\u00a0 I had NO expectations.\u00a0 I knew we could go to Target only so many times. But then\u2026 Monday : I\u2019m sitting at the computer.\u00a0 7:30am.\u00a0 Two out of three boys are up already.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already watched two Nick Jr. shows. My instant message lights up.\u00a0 It\u2019s my friend, Howie\u2019s aide from this past year.\u00a0 She asks what our plans are for the day.\u00a0 I respond with \u201cI have no idea how I\u2019m going to fill up all these hours.\u201d A pause in the messaging.\u00a0 And then\u2026\u201dWant to go to the beach?\u00a0 StreetSweeperMom* is going with her two boys too.\u00a0 We\u2019re leaving in an hour.\u201d I come up with every excuse.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t been to the beach in two years.\u00a0 My kids hate sand.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never been without Tim.\u00a0 We\u2019re not \u201cbeach people\u201d. Well, apparently, we are now. My kids TOUCHING sand. Yeah, take that sensory issues. No beach shoes. First time in 9 years. This day was life changing.\u00a0 I got kicked out of my comfort zone by my friends.\u00a0 And my kids\u2026surprised the heck out of me. *StreetSweeperMom is not her real name.\u00a0 Of course. Tuesday :\u00a0 8:30am.\u00a0 The phone rings.\u00a0 It\u2019s the mom of one of the kids from Howie\u2019s preschool class.\u00a0 She\u2019s taking her son to the playground after his tennis lesson, and she wants to know if we want to meet them there around 10am. My first instinct is to say no.\u00a0 I hate the playground.\u00a0 I hate the constant comparison that I do with my boys and the other kids.\u00a0 I hate the fact that I feel like the only one who \u201chovers\u201d over my kids on the equipment.\u00a0 I hate that I\u2019m the one disciplining other kids while their moms sit on the bench talking on the phone. It\u2019s just one of those places that brings back every bad feeling. But somehow the words \u201cSure!\u201d came out of my mouth. Howie was so happy to see his friend.\u00a0 They spent an hour chasing each other around.\u00a0 I spent an hour bribing Gerry to stay at the park in the heat.\u00a0 Cost me a Captain America Coolatta from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, but he stayed. At 11am, I was finished at the playground as well.\u00a0 I started to give my 5 minute warnings to the boys. \u201cDo you want to leave Howie here with me?\u00a0 I\u2019ll bring him home at lunch time.\u201d It\u2019s Howie\u2019s friend\u2019s mom.\u00a0 My jaw dropped.\u00a0 A string of \u201care you sure?\u201d and \u201cthey could be a handful together\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve never left him here before\u201ds came out of my mouth. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u00a0 I\u2019m familiar with all this.\u201d by \u201call this\u201d she means the autism.\u00a0 Her son\u2019s on the spectrum as well. So I leave him. fossils at the playground...of course. At noon, they\u2019re back at our house.\u00a0 \u201cHe was perfect,\u201d the mom said.  \n That afternoon, we went swimming at our friend\u2019s house.\u00a0 My first time taking the boys in the pool without Tim. Wednesday/Thursday : I chose to let the kids decide when we left the house instead of arguing with them about going out.\u00a0 If it meant not getting dressed until 11am, so be it.\u00a0 We even took a detour to the craft store before the supermarket, breaking my \u201conly one stop\u201d rule.\u00a0 We survived. I\u2019m choosing to ignore the \u201cMom, I\u2019ve been dealing with this since he was four.\u00a0 I\u2019m done.\u201d comment that Gerry made in the car when Howie\u2019s verbal stims got really loud.\u00a0\u00a0 Instead, I\u2019m focusing on the fact that earlier that morning, they built a Hot Wheels track together without me. I\u2019m also choosing to ignore the appointment we had with Lewis at the ENT specialist.\u00a0 He was there for another hearing test.\u00a0 The doctor said he couldn\u2019t even see in his ears.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s like he has a hard crayon in there.\u201d\u00a0 Instead, I\u2019m focusing on the moment that night when he told me \u201cI LOVE spaghetti.\u201d How do you eat sesame noodles? Friday :\u00a0 2pm.\u00a0 The phone rings.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of Gerry\u2019s friends, returning his call from the morning for a playdate.\u00a0 His mom gets on the phone and proposes a child \u201cswitch\u201d.\u00a0 Her youngest is one of Howie\u2019s best buddies.\u00a0 She\u2019ll take the 5 year olds, I\u2019ll take the two 9 year olds and the 2 year old. I take a deep breath.\u00a0 Howie has never been on a solo playdate.\u00a0 Ever.\u00a0 I\u2019ve left him for 20-30 minutes or so when I\u2019ve run out in the middle of a get together, but never an actual \u201cno parent\u201d playdate. I say \u201cOkay!\u00a0 Sounds great!\u201d I send Howie off at 3pm.\u00a0 Tim\u2019s set to pick him up in an hour or so. Two hours pass before they come home.\u00a0 They were playing so well, Tim stayed. Goldfish and They Might Be Giants That night, after the kids are in bed, I go over to StreetSweeperMom\u2019s* house for drinks.\u00a0 Five of my friends are there.\u00a0 We met because we\u2019re all autism moms, but we\u2019re now bonded by so much more.\u00a0 After several glasses of Skinny Girl and many mint chocolate brownies, I share my nerves about traveling to a family reunion alone with the boys. My friend tells me \u201cHowie\u2019s come a long way.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen him change, just these few weeks alone.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d *StreetSweeperMom is still not her real name. Saturday : 6:30 am.\u00a0 Howie\u2019s up and I told him we were having our first swim lesson of the summer.\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t wait to show her how I can swim with my vest on!\u201d\u00a0 I explain that swim lessons are without a vest. Cue two hours of meltdowns.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t seen this in a long time.\u00a0 I\u2019m beginning to wonder if my friend was completely wrong. Those swim lessons are a post all on their own.\u00a0 But he did jump in the water, which was more than I can say happened all of last year. Big jump! The rest of the day was unsettled.\u00a0 We paid big time for the 30 minutes of swimming. Sunday: \u00a0 8pm.\u00a0 We had just told Howie he couldn\u2019t go to the fireworks.\u00a0 The day was one constant \u201cred choice\u201d after another.\u00a0 I sat him down and quietly explained that his engine was running too high to go to the fireworks. He could have completely fallen apart.\u00a0 Instead, he sat quietly for 30 minutes in his green chair.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m making green choices now\u201d, he said at 8:30pm. So off we all went.\u00a0 My first fireworks in five years.\u00a0 Our first time as a family. ( it was dark so I don\u2019t have any pictures.\u00a0 But it was awesome.\u00a0 Five of us in the back of the truck.\u00a0 One kid in headphones saved the day.) Monday : 10:30am.\u00a0 The highs of the week are becoming a distant memory.\u00a0 Just like the fireworks themselves, the whole family is beginning to fade.\u00a0 An attempt at a family breakfast out fizzles.\u00a0 We spend the morning at a friend\u2019s house with their water slide.\u00a0 The boys hold it together there, despite the grouchy faces caused by lack of sleep and a week\u2019s full of tolerance. Who are you calling grouchy? Good luck getting me out of here... Anyone have a towel? Today : 9am.\u00a0 Two boys at camp.\u00a0 One two year old walking around like he owns the place again. This week that I had been dreading was now just a memory. I had expected these eight days to go badly.\u00a0 Now photos and seashells remind us of the week that our world expanded beyond our little house.

For my dear friend, A and anyone who else needs to hear it today. \u2013  Diary of A Mom\u2019s Facebook status .\u00a0 August 8, 2011 ********** Breathe \u2026 At 8:30am yesterday morning, I sat in a small evaluation room at the Center for Special Needs for Children at Tufts Floating Hospital.\u00a0 The doctor had some papers for me to sign before our appointment began, and she handed me a pen and a blue folder to lean on. I recognized the folder right away.\u00a0 It was the same one I was handed on December 22, 2009.\u00a0 The day Howie was diagnosed. The Autism Packet. \u201cBased on the autism diagnostic tests we did last week and our interactions with him, we\u2019re giving Lewis a diagnosis of PDD-NOS.\u00a0 He\u2019s on the mild end of the spectrum.\u00a0 I can see how early intervention could have checked off all the boxes.\u00a0 But when you dig deeper into his play skills, his social pragmatics delay\u2026there\u2019s a lot of deficiencies.\u00a0 He\u2019s a kid that will fall through the cracks.\u00a0 You\u2019re really going to have to advocate for him.\u201d ********** Still breathing\u2026 In the hallway, with my packet and preliminary diagnosis letter in hand, I send out a bunch of texts to some friends.\u00a0 \u201cThey gave him a PDD-NOS diagnosis.\u201d Words of love and support flooded back in short phrases of 140 characters or less.\u00a0 \u201cNothing is different than it was yesterday.\u201d and \u201cFull hug today.\u00a0 Take the time you need.\u00a0 Call if you want.\u00a0 You can do this.\u201d and \u201cYou ok?\u00a0 He will thrive at our preschool\u201d and \u201cDammit.\u201d ********** Barely breathing\u2026 I am angry.\u00a0 Not at the diagnosis.\u00a0 Not at the label.\u00a0 At me.\u00a0 And the whole process.\u00a0 I\u2019m reeling because I didn\u2019t see the labeling. I tell my friends that \u201cthe doctor says he has inconsistent behavior and speech. Not the \u2018right\u2019 play skills. An inability to transfer knowledge from different circumstances (i.e. he can make me a Lego birthday cake at home but can\u2019t play birthday party with a play-doh one). Scripted language and direction. \u201c I tell them that I\u2019m kicking myself for canceling this appointment back in March, when we could have had spring and summer therapy time. And for kidding myself that it was just an articulation delay and nothing else. I say that I\u2019m beating myself up, thinking that if I had spent less time on facebook or blogging, I\u2019d have spent more time on the floor playing with him, and not leaving it up to his brothers to play.\u00a0 Learning their behaviors. But I HATE playing sometimes. I am tired of it.

Two is two. I get that this is a watershed moment. But you know what to do now. You\u2019re already doing it; it\u2019s just a little more weight in your pack. You\u2019ve got this.

{"date": "August 28, 2011", "body": "We interrupt our regularly scheduled post about our vacation week for a hurricane related one. Hurricane Irene barreled her way up the East Coast this weekend, and right into our home.\u00a0 I knew something was brewing Saturday morning, as we were packing up from our vacation, cut short by one day.\u00a0 Howie was relentless in his request for hugs.\u00a0 Every three minutes he was crawling all over me.\u00a0 And when he wasn\u2019t asking for a hug, he was smashing himself into something.\u00a0 Or someone. By this morning, I had my own hurricane.\u00a0 Spinning, whirling, crashing.\u00a0 A wild path of destruction. He\u2019s my walking barometer.\u00a0 I\u2019ve learned now that when he\u2019s completely dysregulated, a storm is brewing.\u00a0 Inside and out. When he\u2019s like this, I just don\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0 I know the stimming and the behavior is hurricane related.\u00a0 But how much do I try to redirect it when it\u2019s caused by the force of nature?\u00a0 My inclination was to let it go, but it was making his brothers crazy. My youngest imitates the nonsense language and out of control behaviors.\u00a0 My oldest is tormented by them. There are times when I wish it was just me and Howie.\u00a0 I could just let him be.\u00a0 Like a hurricane that veers off to sea, there would be no one to destroy in his path.\u00a0 He could spin and run and scream bathroom words and yell out phrases that sound like he\u2019s swearing.\u00a0 And no innocent bystanders would be caught in his path, begging for him to stop. But we don\u2019t live like that.\u00a0 The five of us had to be in the house together and ride out the storm. It was a very long day. Around 4pm, the skies suddenly cleared and the wind stopped blowing.\u00a0 Outside the hurricane had passed. Inside, we had a lot of cleaning up to do.\u00a0 The bumping and the crashing and the yelling had not stopped. I grabbed Howie\u2019s hand and told everyone I was taking him for a walk.\u00a0 Still in our pajamas, we headed out to survey the damage.\u00a0 A quick trip up and down the block showed that we were the only place in town that still had power.\u00a0 A few puddle splashes later, we were back in our yard. And I let my hurricane go. He broke tree branches.\u00a0 He dove into puddles.\u00a0 He did laps around the trees in our yard.\u00a0 He ran back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. Forty-five minutes later, he was done.\u00a0 Downgraded to a minor tropical depression, we headed inside for dinner. And all was calm again. I don\u2019t know how to give him the space he needs to make himself feel better.\u00a0 All I know is that somehow I have to get him to let it out of his system before we all get dragged into it. Hopefully it\u2019s a long long time before we have to figure it out again Goodnight, Irene. \u201c You are like a hurricane \n  There\u2019s calm in your eye. \n  And I\u2019m gettin\u2019 blown away \n  To somewhere safer \n  where the feeling stays. \n  I want to love you but \n  I\u2019m getting blown away. \u201c  \u2013 Like A Hurricane by Neil Young \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2154.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2155.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2157.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2160.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_2164.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/08/28/like-a-hurricane/", "title": "\n\t\t\tLike A Hurricane\t\t"},

It is so part of our every day, woven into every minute of every activity we do.\u00a0 And we \u201cmanage\u201d it, using the language and strategies and skills we\u2019ve been given by our son\u2019s teachers and therapists. It\u2019s not until I watch my son through someone else\u2019s eyes that I see it so clearly. It was all right there at swim lessons. We\u2019ve had two sessions so far.\u00a0 Saturday was our third.\u00a0 Walking in, I noticed our usual instructor wasn\u2019t there.\u00a0 Before our sessions started, I had informed them at the front desk that Howie had autism and that there were going to be parts of the lessons that would be challenging for him, but our goal was to get him comfortable in the water and have a good experience so he\u2019d return to learn more.\u00a0 It\u2019s why we were paying the big bucks for the private one-on-one lessons. Seeing the new teacher, I went up to her while Howie was taking off his shoes on the bench.\u00a0 She looked all of sixteen.\u00a0 Maybe eighteen. \u201cHi, nice to meet you.\u00a0 Just wanted to let you know that Howie has autism, so he might have a hard time in the pool.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be happy if he\u2019s just in the pool.\u00a0 You can remind him that he\u2019s earning something from the vending machine.\u201d She looked at me and said \u201cOkay.\u201d Um, yeah. Those words mean a whole lot to me, and to others who work with kids with autism.\u00a0 To a eighteen year old substitute swim instructor? I\u2019ll give her credit for trying. She coaxed Howie into the pool but couldn\u2019t get him to sit down.\u00a0 For ten minutes of a 30 minute lesson, they worked on sitting down.\u00a0 She had the toy fish sit down.\u00a0 He picked it up and squirted water in her face.\u00a0 She took that away and tried something else.\u00a0 He responded with nonsense babbling and stuck his tongue out at her. I walked over and tapped his shoulder. \u201cRemember, you\u2019re earning.\u00a0 You need to make green choices.\u201d He sat. The instructor tried to get him to put his face in the water to blow bubbles.\u00a0 He blew at the water but not in it.\u00a0 She took the fish out again and had the fish blow bubbles.\u00a0 Again, he grabbed the fish and squirted her in the face. She asked him to sit on the \u201csafety step\u201d \u2013 the second step into the shallow end.\u00a0 He refused.\u00a0 I could see the lifeguard getting agitated.\u00a0 I could see the instructor\u2019s confusion knowing that he\u2019s had two lessons already and he wasn\u2019t past the safety step. I closed my eyes for just a moment.\u00a0 I opened them and looked over at Gerry, having his lesson on the other side of the pool.\u00a0 Floating, kicking, swimming.\u00a0 Quietly.\u00a0 Easily. Twenty minutes into the lesson, she got Howie in the pool.\u00a0 I watched her try to get him to kick his feet and \u201cice cream scoop\u201d his hands.\u00a0 He got silly.\u00a0 At this same point in the lesson last week, something about his hands being ice cream scoops made him laugh.\u00a0 And once again, here we were. She had him crawl like a spider along the wall and climb out.\u00a0 The lesson was over. Howie was shivering like he had just been swimming in the Arctic.\u00a0 He had to pee. As we walked over to the changing rooms, I saw the instructor and the lifeguard share a look.\u00a0 I know that look.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t a mean look.\u00a0 More of a \u201cthat was a hard one\u201d look. I get it. And it\u2019s important for me to be reminded of it. At our last appointment with our developmental pediatrician, she said that our long term goal was for Howie to be able to walk down the street and for no one to know that he has autism.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure that should be our goal.\u00a0 The autism \u2013 the quirks and challenges that he has \u2013 are part of him. Would I like to have those challenges not be there?\u00a0 Of course.\u00a0 Will we do whatever it takes to help him learn life skills and coping strategies to make his life easier?\u00a0 Absolutely. But it\u2019s also my job to help the world understand him.\u00a0 That he\u2019s not being a brat or just a difficult kid, but that he\u2019s processing the world around him differently.\u00a0 I have to say more than just \u201c he has autism \u201c.\u00a0 I can\u2019t expect that to mean anything more than a word to an eighteen year old who has never worked with special needs kids. We\u2019re spreading awareness at swim lessons and everywhere else we go.\u00a0 But don\u2019t move along.\u00a0 Take a moment to look and understand. If someone knows the name of this stroke, please let me know. \u201c Listening to you, I get the music \n  Gazing at you, I get the heat \n Following you, I climb the mountain \n  I get excitement at your feet  Right behind you, I see the millions \n  On you, I see the glory \n  From you, I get opinion \n  From you, I get the story \u201d \u2013 See Me, Feel Me by The Who \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/scoops.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/07/20/see-me-feel-me/", "title": "\n\t\t\tSee Me, Feel\u00a0Me\t\t"},
{"date": "July 13, 2011", "body": "I remember that night like it was yesterday. February, 2008.\u00a0 I\u2019m with Howie.\u00a0 He\u2019s just a few weeks shy of two years old.\u00a0 We\u2019re at Children\u2019s Hospital.\u00a0 It\u2019s 8 o\u2019clock at night. He\u2019s being very good as they attach about 20 wires to his head.\u00a0 His eyes are fixated on \u201cCurious George\u201d on the small TV hanging from the ceiling.\u00a0 He starts to squirm a bit \u2013 the smell of the glue is starting to get to him.\u00a0 I hold him tighter, telling him it\u2019s almost time for sleep. We\u2019re there for an overnight sleep study.\u00a0 At almost two, he still had never slept through the night.\u00a0 Not once.\u00a0 And he wouldn\u2019t sleep alone.\u00a0 After a year of trying everything possible to get him to sleep, we\u2019re at the hospital to make sure there\u2019s nothing else going on. I\u2019m told to hold him in the bed until he\u2019s drifted off.\u00a0 The technician would whisper into the speaker when it was okay for me to move to my tiny bed across the room.\u00a0 We would do this dance 5 times during the night.\u00a0 It was the worst sleep of my life. The results showed \u201cabnormal brain blips\u201d, so we returned a few weeks later to get fitted for a 24 hour EEG.\u00a0 I was six weeks pregnant with Lewis and beyond exhausted.\u00a0 I held my newly minted two year old down as once again wires were attached to his head.\u00a0 This time, he screamed.\u00a0 We had to restrain him. Two weeks later, I sat in the presiding doctor\u2019s office.\u00a0 He described the abnormal brain blips as \u201cbenign rolandic epilepsy\u201d.\u00a0 He told me to watch Howie when he drifted off to sleep, particularly if it happened in the car.\u00a0 Then he told me it was nothing to worry about, and if we didn\u2019t see a seizure by the time he was 11 or 12, then he would be fine. Oh, and by the way, it has nothing to do with why he won\u2019t sleep, he said.\u00a0 Just leave him in his crib to cry.\u00a0 If he throws up, clean it up and put him back.\u00a0 He handed me a sheet on how to change his sleep behaviors.\u00a0 To undo what we had been doing wrong. I remember it all like it was yesterday.\u00a0 His words still make  me  want to throw up. To this day, Howie does not sleep consistently. But now I know better.\u00a0 At the time of our sleep study, we didn\u2019t have an autism diagnosis or even a sensory processing disorder diagnosis.\u00a0 We had nothing but my anecdotal data and the belief that he woke up every time he peed in his diaper.\u00a0 The knowledge that he had to be touching me when he slept.\u00a0 The feeling that everyone judged me because my two year old slept in bed with me. Now I know.\u00a0 I know that this is not a behavior issue.\u00a0 I can\u2019t \u201csticker chart\u201d him to stay in his bed all night.\u00a0 Believe me, we\u2019ve tried.\u00a0 He comes in, we bring him back to his bed.\u00a0 I stay until I think he\u2019s asleep, then I wait five minutes more just to make sure.\u00a0 An hour later, he\u2019s back again. Gerry and Lewis started off in our bed too.\u00a0 Through behavior modification, they both returned to their beds.\u00a0 And they sleep through the night. I know this is something different for Howie.\u00a0 The melatonin has made a huge difference \u2013 it no longer takes him hours to fall asleep and when he does wake up in the middle of the night he goes back to sleep fairly easily.\u00a0 We\u2019re not spending hours at 2am flipping through pictures of Story Land to calm him down. I know that his diet plays a part.\u00a0 When he eats something that bothers him, he\u2019s up for nights in a row. I know that sensory inputs are important.\u00a0 He sleeps under weighted blankets and three other covers.\u00a0 He\u2019s in long sleeves pajamas in the dead of winter and the scorching heat of summer.\u00a0 Our house is kept at a constant temperature at night no matter what the calendar says.\u00a0 No windows open while we sleep. I know that he needs to fall asleep with me there \u2013 his arm \u201ctunneling\u201d into my neck on one side and my arm tightly wrapped around him.\u00a0 I\u2019ve given up caring what the \u201cexperts\u201d say about sleeping with your kid.\u00a0 I need to do whatever gets us through the night unscathed. But I can\u2019t always predict the triggers that wake him.\u00a0 And even when he doesn\u2019t wake up\u2026I do.\u00a0 Expecting him to come in at any moment. After 5 years of this,  I  don\u2019t remember how to sleep anymore either. His sleep issues aren\u2019t just a problem for him.\u00a0 It affects our whole family.\u00a0 I can\u2019t remember the last time I got eight hours of straight sleep. Tim and I can\u2019t get away for a night just us.\u00a0 We\u2019re keeping our local Dunkin\u2019 Donuts in business. There are days when I\u2019m beyond tired. And I\u2019m tired of it. Every family with a child on the spectrum has pieces of the puzzle that they want solved.\u00a0 For us, our missing piece is sleep. I just want that puzzle solved. he's sleeping! no...he isn't... \u201c Whatever gets you through the night it\u2019s alright, it\u2019s alright \nIt\u2019 your money or your life it\u2019s alright, it\u2019s alright \nDon\u2019t need a sword to cut thru flowers oh no, oh no \nWhatever gets you thru your life it\u2019s alright, it\u2019s alright \nDo it wrong or do it right it\u2019s alright, it\u2019s alright \nDon\u2019t need a watch to waste your time oh no, oh no\u201d \u2013  Whatever Gets You Through The Night by John Lennon \nThis post was written as part of the Best of the Best, Edition 8: Sleep Issues  \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/sleep_blanket1-300x225.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/sleep_blanket2-300x225.jpg", "http://sos-research-blog.com/07/best-of-the-best-edition-8-sleep-issues-bedtime-and-special-needs-kids/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/whatever-gets-you-through-the-night/", "title": "\n\t\t\tWhatever Gets You Through The\u00a0Night\t\t"},
{"date": "June 14, 2011", "body": "If life had a \u201crewind\u201d button, I would have used it today. The day started out as an exercise in logistics.\u00a0 Gerry woke up with ear pain, which I knew was serious considering his class was going bowling this morning.\u00a0 Somehow I needed to get him to the doctor after driving Howie to school and before Lewis\u2019 speech therapy appointment at the house.\u00a0 Already late for preschool, I was on the phone with the doctor\u2019s office while simultaneously trying to get out the door with three non-compliant boys.\u00a0 And my car keys?\u00a0 Nowhere to be found. Yes, for the second time in 48 hours, I had misplaced them.\u00a0 Completely. I found my spare keys by some miracle and pushed the kids out the door.\u00a0 We had to be on time.\u00a0 Howie\u2019s class was going up to kindergarten for the last visit, and he was taking the big yellow bus.\u00a0 Since he won\u2019t be taking it in the fall, we didn\u2019t want to miss this. I quickly dropped Howie off and flew to the doctor\u2019s office.\u00a0 An hour later, we were out the door with \u201cit\u2019s just a virus\u201d and made our way back home with 30 minutes to spare before Lewis\u2019 speech therapist arrived.\u00a0 Just enough time for a snack and a very quick house cleaning.\u00a0 By that I mean I picked up all the Hot Wheels track in the living room so they had a place to sit.\u00a0 I do not mean that I cleaned up anything else. About 30 minutes in to the speech session, the phone rings.\u00a0 It\u2019s preschool.\u00a0 My heart jumps into my throat. It\u2019s Howie\u2019s teacher.\u00a0 They\u2019re just back from their kindergarten visit and she wanted to fill me in.\u00a0 For this visit, they purposely went when the cafeteria would be busy\u2026and smelly.\u00a0 They wanted Howie (and the other kids) to experience this first hand to see how they would react. Apparently Howie reacted by stopping in his tracks halfway down the hall, and covered his nose.\u00a0 For the whole hour.\u00a0 The smell of bacon and french toast cooking hit him hard. This wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal if, of course, his new kindergarten classroom wasn\u2019t directly across from the cafeteria.\u00a0 This smell aversion will be a daily occurrence once school starts in the fall. On the phone, we immediately brainstormed some plans of action.\u00a0 Social stories about smells.\u00a0 A \u201csmell desensitization\u201d program starting this summer at home, with us cooking different foods.\u00a0 Buying stock in Yankee Candle. I hung up the phone and my wheels were spinning.\u00a0 Just like any autism parent, my brain immediately went into fix it mode.\u00a0 I sent out e-mails asking for advice from my fellow autism moms.\u00a0 I was on it 100%. Then, from the other room\u2026 \u201cAlysia, do you have a minute for a question?\u201d It\u2019s Lewis\u2019 speech/language pathologist.\u00a0 Who I adore.\u00a0 And this sounded bad. \u201cHow do I ask you this without stressing you out?\u201d Um\u2026too late. \u201cHow long do you think it would take you to get a full developmental evaluation set up for Lewis?\u201d What?\u00a0 You mean like the one I canceled back in March because I thought everything was fine?\u00a0 Say that again? \u201cI\u2019m seeing things that worry me.\u00a0 More, I\u2019m NOT seeing things.\u00a0 Have you noticed that when he plays he gets fixated on one thing?\u00a0 I kept trying to move on from the fruit but he won\u2019t change gears.\u00a0 And he\u2019s only imitating me with play, he\u2019s not initiating the play.\u201d I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I was so focused on the fact that he was \u201cpretend playing\u201d at all that I never noticed HOW he was playing.  \u201cDoes he make eye contact with you when he asks you for things?\u201d The better question is, do I make eye contact with HIM?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I usually have one eye on his brother making sure no one is getting into trouble\u2026 \u201cI just thought it was best to talk about it now, and not 5 months from now, in case it takes you a while to get an appointment.\u00a0 He\u2019s a big imitator.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure how you run your house in order to help your other son\u2026\u201d You can stop right there.\u00a0 I don\u2019t run my house at all.\u00a0 Clearly.\u00a0 And yes, I have no idea what\u2019s going on either.\u00a0 Is he imitating his brother or is this his behavior?\u00a0 He\u2019s the polar opposite of Howie.\u00a0 Receptive language is right on target, expressive language is behind.\u00a0 Howie was the reverse.\u00a0 With both, behavior is a struggle. And no, I have lost all concept of what is \u201cnormal\u201d anymore. I e-mail my friends with this update.\u00a0 One friend writes me back \u201cDeep breaths.\u00a0 And chocolate.\u201d\u00a0 I reply that I\u2019ve already inhaled an entire box of cookies. I make two quick calls to \u201creschedule\u201d the appointment that we canceled back in March.\u00a0 But no time for tears or wallowing, because I had to pick up Howie for an appointment with a pediatric urologist.\u00a0 An hour away. I run out to the car.\u00a0 Tim has thankfully come home to be with the two other boys.\u00a0 Turn the car on, warning bells ring.\u00a0 I have a brake light out. I call to Tim: \u201cMy left brake light is out.\u00a0 Will that be okay?\u201d His response: \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be.\u201d We were, of course, late for the appointment, partly due to traffic and partly Howie became fixated on the revolving doors at the hospital.\u00a0 In the waiting room, the questions became repetitive.\u00a0  \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d  \u201cRemember when it hurt when you peed a while ago?\u201d  \u201cBut I\u2019m better now.\u00a0 Why am I here?\u201d The doctor\u2019s exam was quick and he was quite good with Howie.\u00a0 He turned to me and we began to chat about how to keep this from happening. \u201cWith kids like him, this could be a recurring problem.\u201d Kids like him??\u00a0 What does he mean? I turned and looked over at my son.\u00a0 Spinning, pacing, rocking back and forth on his legs.\u00a0 Flicking his fingers.\u00a0 Babbling nonsense words. Oh.\u00a0 Kids like him.\u00a0 Kids with autism. I wanted to cry. I thanked him for his help and told him we\u2019d be in touch for our next steps.\u00a0 The ride home was an exercise in perseveration \u2013 there was a bridge at the doctor\u2019s office near the parking garage.\u00a0 He wanted to run on it.\u00a0 I had no idea until we were already on the highway.\u00a0 Forty minutes of \u201cTurn this car around!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going to ruin your life!\u201d and \u201cMom, you\u2019re so ANNOYING!\u201d (chances are, this won\u2019t be the last time I hear that.) The next several hours were completely unsettled.\u00a0 I lost track of how many times time outs I issued. ********** I\u2019ve been spending the rest of this night eating my mint chocolate brownie (graciously delivered by my amazing friend) and thinking over the day.\u00a0 Everything just seemed to pile on.\u00a0 But I kept going back to what Tim said about my brake lights when I asked if it was going to be okay. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be.\u201d And that\u2019s what I have to remember.\u00a0 That no matter what comes our way, we\u2019ll figure out how to make it okay.\u00a0 Whatever steps we need to take to make things right, we\u2019ll do it.

{"date": "July 25, 2011", "body": "I only wanted my sons to go to college.\u00a0 I wanted them to have the opportunities that I didn\u2019t have.\u00a0 That\u2019s all I asked for. -my 89 year old grandmother, July 23 2011 I\u2019ll be honest.\u00a0 When I saw the e-mail announcement about my family\u2019s reunion, I wasn\u2019t going to go. The reunion tradition on my dad\u2019s side goes back to the early 1970s.\u00a0 My dad was the middle child of five brothers and we would get together every three years somewhere across the globe for a week.\u00a0 Sometimes it was close to home in New York, other times farther away.\u00a0 But it was a standing tradition.\u00a0 We would swim in pools or the ocean together, visit cities and tourist attractions together, and of course, eat together.\u00a0 A lot.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I always looked forward to these reunions as many of my cousins lived far away and it was the only time we\u2019d get to see them. As I got older, I began to see how unusual these reunions were.\u00a0 Our family is closer than most.\u00a0 I grew up living next door to two of my dad\u2019s brothers and their families, and their children were more like siblings to me than cousins.\u00a0 My friends jokingly referred to our houses as \u201cthe compound\u201d, in a reference to the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod (but without the estates.\u00a0 And the scandals).\u00a0 When I moved to Boston, I moved into my cousin\u2019s apartment.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t even like my cousins,\u201d a college friend told me, \u201clet alone like them enough to live with them.\u201d\u00a0 But this was my \u201cnormal\u201d.\u00a0 This was how I was brought up.\u00a0 We weren\u2019t just family.\u00a0 We were friends. This reunion, though, was going to be different.\u00a0 Our first one since 1996.\u00a0 My first one with my kids.\u00a0 My first one without my dad. I wasn\u2019t sure I could handle either of those two things. But as the reunion attendee list expanded, I knew I had to be there.\u00a0 We had family coming from as far away as Brazil and Germany.\u00a0 My cousins were bringing their babies that I had never met.\u00a0 My brother and sister-in-law were going to be there, along with my mother and sister.\u00a0 And once I knew my 89 year old grandmother was making the trip, I sent in my RSVP for yes. Because this wasn\u2019t about me anymore.\u00a0 This was about family. Surrounded by family everywhere. Feeling like the old days. Swimming, laughing, eating in 110 degree heat. Feeling nothing but love. -my Facebook status July 22, 2011 From the moment we got there, it felt like old times. It was an extended family reunion with not just my first cousins but with my dad\u2019s cousins as well. The 13 great grandchildren ranged in age from 10 months old to 9 years old.\u00a0 They ran up and down the corridors of the reception room playing tag and racing each other.\u00a0 They laughed at each other\u2019s silly faces and played games on the floor. And where else but at a family reunion could my 23 year old cousin make swords out of balloons for my three kids so my boys could \u201cfight\u201d each other?\u00a0 And then join in himself? This is what I remembered.\u00a0 The joy and ease of just being together.\u00a0 Like family should be. And my kids?\u00a0 Amazed me. I\u2019m guessing that at least half of the relatives there know about my son and his autism.\u00a0 Maybe more.\u00a0 But not one singled him out for anything.\u00a0 When he took to the floor of the reception room with his Hot Wheels cars and drove them along the pattern of the rug (which looked remarkably like a road), no one batted an eye.\u00a0 As he wound his way under tables and under feet, aunts and uncles and cousins just let him pass by, sometimes even joining in behind him.\u00a0 They let him be\u2026whatever he needed to be. There was no sensory overload for him.\u00a0 Everyone understood what he could and couldn\u2019t eat and do.\u00a0 There was no pressure for us to be part of the group, which made being part of the group much easier.\u00a0 His only meltdown was at 9pm our last night there when he realized we were going home the next day. I learned a few things that weekend about my family.\u00a0 First, they don\u2019t just \u201ctalk the talk\u201d when it comes to tolerance, acceptance and understanding.\u00a0 They walk the walk.\u00a0 There were no disapproving looks, no whispering behind backs.\u00a0 Just concern and genuine care for one another. Secondly, I actually like these people.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like them because they are family but because they are good, decent, and fun.\u00a0 I  want  to spend time with them.\u00a0 Like my kids, I wasn\u2019t ready for the weekend to end. And finally, being with my family felt like home.\u00a0 It was a comfort that I had been missing for a long time.\u00a0 Since 1996. I\u2019m not going to lie and say that there weren\u2019t times that I felt something was missing.\u00a0 I watched my four uncles talk together, and I would remember back to when there were five.\u00a0 The funny pranks felt like there was one jokester too few, the laughs didn\u2019t go on quite as long.\u00a0 There was one less sarcastic voice in the mix.\u00a0 But in many ways, I felt my dad there with us that weekend.\u00a0 My uncles each have traits that remind me of him. And my kids?\u00a0 Every day they show some part of my dad\u2019s soul.\u00a0 This weekend, they showed me how important being part of a family is. On the way home, I thought a lot about my grandmother\u2019s quote from the weekend.\u00a0 \u201cI only wanted my sons to go to college.\u00a0 I wanted them to have the opportunities that I didn\u2019t have.\u00a0 That\u2019s all I asked for.\u201d\u00a0 As a parent, I understand that completely, of course.\u00a0 We all want our kids to have what we didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t have in life. But in this instance, I wanted my kids to have the opportunities that I  did  have. I want them to know their cousins and spend time with them.\u00a0 I want them to feel like a part of something special, something unusual.\u00a0 I want them to know that no matter how hard things are, their family will always be there for them. They got that this weekend. And hopefully, for more weekends to come. My oldest with my 89 year old grandmother.

{"date": "June 19, 2011", "body": "Sometimes, words do speak louder than actions. Last month, my husband was away on his annual business trip.\u00a0 I know that we\u2019re lucky that he doesn\u2019t travel that often, but when he does, it takes its toll quickly.\u00a0 On me and the boys. It was Tuesday evening \u2013 the third night into his trip.\u00a0 It had been a long difficult day up to this point.\u00a0 I was clearly at the end of my rope with the boys, and them with me.\u00a0 The \u201cgood night\u201d phone call was hastily arranged across two time zones, with an attempt to fit it in between bedtime for the kids and dinner time for Tim. Howie got on the phone first and I put it on speakerphone.\u00a0 His ability to communicate on the phone is a relatively new phenomenon, but he was excited to talk to Daddy that night. They chatted a bit about Howie\u2019s day at school (a tough one) and then the conversation turned to Hot Wheels, or more specifically, my inability to create a decent Hot Wheels track. \u201cDad!\u201d, he said with pain in his voice.\u00a0 \u201cDad!\u00a0 When are you coming home?\u00a0 I just really really miss you!\u201d My eyes welled up with tears.\u00a0 There was a brief silence on the other end of the phone.\u00a0 Across 2000 miles, Tim and I were processing the same thing at the same time.\u00a0 This was the first unprompted expression of affection for his dad.\u00a0 Ever. I\u2019m the one who is usually on the receiving end of what\u2019s perceived as affection : the hugs, the desperate searches through the house when I\u2019m in the shower, the person he demands in the middle of the night. But his dad is the one who connects with him on the \u201cimportant\u201d things.\u00a0 The one who lets him help fix the broken shower pipe and takes him on a tour of the basement to follow the path of the water.\u00a0 The one who hands him the screwdriver as they replace the burnt out bulb in the brake light of my van.\u00a0 The one who works  with  him to create the most elaborate and most awesome of Hot Wheels tracks. But until this point, he had never been able to verbalize it. Tim and I talked about it later that night.\u00a0 We were both still a little shell shocked. \u201cI guess absence makes the heart grow fonder?\u201d Tim said. Something like that. ********** They say that women tend to marry their fathers.\u00a0 On paper, it would look like the complete opposite for me.\u00a0 However, I married a man who puts his family first above all else.\u00a0 A guy who understands what it means to be a dad, whether it\u2019s playing ball in the yard or reading a bedtime story or\u2026crawling around on the floor racing Hot Wheels cars.\u00a0 That was my dad too.\u00a0 Exactly. Happy Father\u2019s Day to my amazing husband and to all the fathers out there who go above and beyond for their kids. Happy Father\u2019s Day to the fathers-to-be\u2026and the fathers-that-should-be.\u00a0 You deserve to feel the joy of watching your children grow before your eyes. And Happy Father\u2019s Day to my  dad , who I miss more with every passing day.\u00a0 Absence really does make the heart grow fonder. \u201cI learned from you that I do not crumble \n  I learned that strength is somethin\u2019 you choose \n  All of the reasons to keep on believin\u2019 \n  There\u2019s no question, that\u2019s a lesson, I learned from you I do not crumble \n  I learned that strength is somethin\u2019 you choose \n  All of the reasons to keep on believin\u2019 \n  There\u2019s no question, that\u2019s a lesson, I learned from you I learned from you .\u201d \u2013 I Learned From You by Miley Cyrus \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/bouncehouseboys.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/11/12/peace-train/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/i-learned-from-you/", "title": "\n\t\t\tI Learned From\u00a0You\t\t"},
{"date": "June 13, 2011", "body": "\u201cMom! iPad Angry Birds?\u201d \u2013 my two year old this morning I remember the first time I played  Angry Birds .\u00a0 I was on the floor next to my two year old\u2019s crib, hoping he\u2019d fall asleep fast.\u00a0 I had so much to do, but he won\u2019t fall asleep without me laying there.\u00a0 I borrowed my husband\u2019s iPhone to check Facebook.\u00a0 Up to this point, I had avoided playing Angry Birds.\u00a0 I\u2019m not a fan of video games, mostly because I\u2019m not very good at them.\u00a0 But it was a quite night on Facebook, and I was desperately trying to stay awake in the dark.\u00a0 So I played. I stunk at it. So I played again.\u00a0 And again.\u00a0 And again until I beat that first level. An hour passed.\u00a0 My son was long asleep.\u00a0 I was still playing. The rush I felt that night was one that I had not felt in a while.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t addiction or compulsion.\u00a0 I could walk away. It was more a sense of\u2026accomplishment.\u00a0 For the first time in a long time, I was feeling like I  finished  something. A lifetime ago when I used to work outside the home, I had that feeling all of the time.\u00a0 I would start a project and see it to completion.\u00a0 The accolades and rewards would come in with a \u201cjob well done\u201d from my boss.\u00a0 Then I\u2019d be assigned a new project, have more responsibilities, and see that through as well.\u00a0 The reviews would come in, and I\u2019d feel great. At home, my sense of immediate accomplishment is non-existent.\u00a0 Yes, I know I\u2019m raising three incredible boys.\u00a0 All this hard work will pay off many many years from now, when they become great citizens of the world.\u00a0 But right now, there\u2019s no instant feedback loop for me.\u00a0 I do a load of laundry, there\u2019s four more right behind it.\u00a0 I clean one room, there\u2019s five more that need attention.\u00a0 I pick up 50 Hot Wheels cars, and in 10 minutes I\u2019m stepping on them again.\u00a0 I cook one meal, and there\u2019s four people complaining about it. But with Angry Birds?\u00a0 I knock down those towers and crush those pigs.\u00a0 I get a \u201cyippee!\u201d from the remaining birds, three bright yellow stars, and sometimes if I\u2019m lucky, a new high score.\u00a0 And a new level unlocks with a new challenge, and I do it all over again. It\u2019s not just me that\u2019s getting this sense of accomplishment from Angry Birds.\u00a0 One of Howie\u2019s goals on his IEP from the beginning has been about game play.\u00a0 Taking turns is incredibly difficult for him.\u00a0 He cannot stand to lose.\u00a0 I can\u2019t tell you how many times his log sheet comes home with \u201cHowie had a hard time when he lost at Candyland (or insert any board game here).\u201d\u00a0 He has a meltdown when he loses a running race, a car race, or just a race up the stairs. But with Angry Birds?\u00a0 No meltdown.\u00a0 He just plays and plays and plays until he gets it right.\u00a0 And then sometimes he\u2019ll play the same level again just to get the score higher.\u00a0 Or to knock down a watermelon.\u00a0 Or capture a golden egg. It\u2019s been a wonder to watch him play.\u00a0 It\u2019s teaching him game play skills that he wasn\u2019t getting from a regular board game.\u00a0 He shares the iPad and takes turns playing levels with his younger brother. And we\u2019re seeing it translate at home into better sportsmanship with his both of his brothers. Not great, but better. I know there\u2019s a lot of naysayers about this new technology.\u00a0 Some say it brings us one more level removed from each other.\u00a0 Others worry that our kids have unfettered access to inappropriate content on the internet.\u00a0 To them I say that I\u2019m still my kids\u2019 parent.\u00a0 I set limits and watch what they do. But keep the technology from them completely?\u00a0 Not a chance. Not when my five year old is learning physics and game play from Angry Birds. Not when my nine year old uses the  Pages  app to write a one page paper on the American Revolution based on what he learned in school that day.\u00a0 Unprompted. Not when my two year old is using apps like  Speech With Milo  to help him pronounce words or  Tally Tots  to learn how to count to twenty. Not when my friend\u2019s son with autism was able to use his iPod Touch to tell his preschool teacher his favorite thing about her FOR THE FIRST TIME.\u00a0 In front of the whole class and a room full of parents. So if you need me, I\u2019ll be on the couch with my boys and our iPad.\u00a0 You might find us drawing a picture, listening to a story, or taking turns with a game.\u00a0 Together. And that is quite an accomplishment. \"Mom! I got three stars and beat your high score!

One of the moms who volunteers in the class comes up to us.\u00a0 \u201cI bought some Italian Ices at the store for Howie.\u00a0 I looked everywhere for something that he could eat.\u00a0 There\u2019s no corn in it at all.\u00a0 I wanted to make sure he had something special here.\u201d I had held it together pretty well during the show, but my eyes welled up a little here. ********** It\u2019s Memorial Day, and we\u2019re at our friend\u2019s house for an afternoon BBQ.\u00a0 It\u2019s about 90 degrees out, and we\u2019ve been in and out of their pool and trampoline for hours.\u00a0 It\u2019s three families spending the afternoon together \u2013 six adults and seven kids.\u00a0 No one bats an eye when Howie has a meltdown about the bugs and needs to sit.\u00a0 He\u2019s tickled, fed and included every moment of the day.\u00a0 The kids all play  together  easily, moving from one activity to the next.\u00a0 When it\u2019s time to go, Howie screams and begs for more time.\u00a0 My friends help me gather our stuff and we make a quick exit.\u00a0 Later, I e-mail them thanking them for treating Howie like Howie.\u00a0 I thank them for raising their kids to be tolerant and understanding, because we all know it\u2019s not always like that.\u00a0 I tell them that other kids are already noticing that Howie is different, but their kids don\u2019t see anything but a regular 5 year old boy. ********** Yesterday afternoon, the phone rings.\u00a0 It\u2019s my friend (from the story above) and she\u2019s calling to give me a heads up about her son\u2019s 5th birthday party.\u00a0 Her oldest and my oldest are best friends. Howie and her youngest are best buds too.\u00a0 They are having the party at Pump It Up, a large indoor bounce house playspace.\u00a0 She wants to know if there\u2019s anything she can do to make the place more \u201csensory friendly\u201d for Howie.\u00a0 \u201cIt gets really loud in there with the music.\u00a0 I can\u2019t do anything about the sound of all the blowers, but I can ask them to turn down the music if you think it would be too much.\u201d\u00a0 As she\u2019s talking to me, Howie is in the midst of a giant meltdown at my feet.\u00a0 He\u2019s screaming at me to get off the phone and just help him.\u00a0 My eyes well up again. ********** Three stories.\u00a0 One theme.\u00a0 I write a lot about having a \u201c village \u201d \u2013 friends with kids with special needs who \u201c get it \u201c.\u00a0 They walk in my shoes every day and they understand the pain and frustration and heartache without explanation. But the friends in each of three stories all have \u201ctypical\u201d kids.\u00a0 They don\u2019t walk in my shoes.\u00a0 They don\u2019t  have  to understand. But they do.\u00a0 The mom didn\u2019t have to think of MY kid when she was shopping for treats for the school party.\u00a0 There are 17 other kids in that class, including her own, yet she was concerned about my kid having something to eat.\u00a0 My friends could have made snide remarks about my son at the BBQ, but instead they went out of their way to help us feel comfortable at their house.\u00a0 My friend didn\u2019t have to think about MY son at all when planning her kid\u2019s birthday party.\u00a0 But she was willing to make accommodations for him\u00a0 so that he could enjoy the celebration. They aren\u2019t put off by the labels that surround my kid.\u00a0 They just see my kid. And for that, they are part of my village too. \u201cOh, the more we get together, \n  Together, together, \n  Oh, the more we get together, \n  The happier we\u2019ll be.

{"date": "May 23, 2011", "body": "\u201cI made green choices when you were gone!\u00a0 Where\u2019s my special treat?\u201d Crap. Saturday night, I went out with some friends for a much needed girls\u2019 night out.\u00a0 We saw the movie \u201cBridesmaids\u201d (my first non-animated theater movie in 5 years) and stayed for dinner and drinks.\u00a0 I told Howie that if he made \u201cgreen choices\u201d while I was out, I\u2019d bring him back a special treat. I forgot.\u00a0 Maybe somewhere in the back of my mind I thought there was no way he\u2019d have a good night, considering the state I left him in.\u00a0 But Tim said that after he got over the initial shock of his pizza looking \u201cwrong\u201d, he settled in and had a great night. And now, at 7am, he wanted his treat.\u00a0 I had to think fast on my feet. I tried to think of all the places I could have hidden a new Hot Wheels car.\u00a0 I tend to buy them in bulk, because\u2026well, you just never know. Suddenly, something caught my eye outside our front window. Howie\u2019s had a bit of an obsession with dandelions lately, specifically the ones that have turned white with seeds, ready to fly away in the wind.\u00a0 Whenever he sees one, we have to stop.\u00a0 In the yard.\u00a0 On a walk.\u00a0 On the way into school and leaving.\u00a0 He spots them from the car.\u00a0 He has to pick them and blow the seeds away until the flower is clean. Right outside our window was one perfect white seeded dandelion.\u00a0 Just one. \u201cHow about this special treat? Do you want to go out in your pajamas by yourself and get that dandelion?\u00a0 I\u2019ll watch you from the window.\u201d I thought for sure he\u2019d say no.\u00a0 Or beg me to come with him.\u00a0 He won\u2019t even go up to his room alone, so I was afraid this would backfire. We\u2019ve never let him out in the yard without one of us.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always been too nervous that his impulses would take over and he\u2019d get hurt. Howie jumped up, looked out the window, and ran over to get his shoes. \u201cI can go out all by myself.\u201d\u00a0 Not a question, but a statement. I opened the door and he ran out front. I stood at the window and watched him carefully approach the dandelion.\u00a0 He did not want to risk any potential breeze that would blow the seeds away until he was ready.\u00a0 He quickly pulled the dandelion out of the ground.\u00a0 And what followed was pure joy. We see the dandelion as a weed, growing and invading our lawns and our flower beds. My son sees them as something special.\u00a0 Something to set free and watch in wonder. Once the dandelion was empty, he threw it back on the lawn, ran up to the door and knocked to come in. \u201cDid you like your special treat?\u201d, I asked. \u201cYES!\u00a0 Thank you!\u201d His older brother Gerry came into the room and asked what was going on. \u201cGerry!\u00a0 GERRY!\u00a0 I-went-outside-all-by-myself-in-my-pajamas-and-I-blew-all-the-seeds-away-and-then-I-came-back-inside.\u00a0 In my PAJAMAS!\u201d\u00a0 He was so excited it all came out like one giant word. \u201cWOW!\u201d, replied Gerry, his voice dripping with over-the-top enthusiasm in an effort to show me that he\u2019s being a good big brother.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s so BRAVE of you.\u201d A big smile came over Howie\u2019s face.\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cI was brave.\u00a0 It was my special treat.\u201d \u201c You belong among the wildflowers \n You belong somewhere close to me \n Far away from your trouble and worry \n You belong somewhere you feel free \n You belong somewhere you feel free \u201d \u2013 Wildflowers by Tom Petty \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/flower5.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/flower2.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/flower3.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/wildflowers/", "title": "\n\t\t\tWildflowers\t\t"},

But the rewards are amazing. \n I no longer judge.\u00a0 Anyone.\u00a0 Ever.\u00a0 (or at least out loud) \n He\u2019s shown me the beauty in the little things: to slow down for a  walk to pick up an acorn  or to take the long way home to hear the end of a song. \n He\u2019s introduced me to some of the most  amazing people  I\u2019ve ever met.\u00a0 People who I want to have as friends.\u00a0 People who understand and accept us for us. \n I now celebrate the accomplishments in our own time, not because some book told us when it was supposed to happen. \n I try to use the words \u201cchild-appropriate\u201d, instead of \u201cage-appropriate\u201d. \n I have learned that there\u2019s nothing better than a hug out of love. \n He helped me find my voice \u2013 here on this blog and with other newly diagnosed parents. \n He\u2019s shown me that the most important job we can have as a parent is to be our child\u2019s best advocate.\u00a0 To speak for them when they cannot.\u00a0 And to fight to the end to get them the help they need. \n And above all else\u2026 \n He has made me a better wife, mother, and friend.\u00a0 I would not be the person I am today had this gift not entered my life five years ago. \n Happy Birthday to my little man. \u201c People see me \n  I\u2019m a challenge to your balance \n  I\u2019m over your heads \n  How I confound you and astound you \n  To know I must be one of the wonders \n  Of God\u2019s own creation \n  And as far as you can see you can offer me \n  No explanation   O, I believe \n  Fate smiled and destiny \n  Laughed as she came to my cradle \n  Know this child will be able \n  Laughed as she came to my mother \n  Know this child will not suffer \n  Laughed as my body she lifted \n  Know this child will be gifted \n  With love, with patience and with faith \n  She\u2019ll make her way \u201d \u2013 Wonder by Natalie Merchant (this post was inspired by my friend  Stimey , who asked a few of us to share our favorite things about our kids.\u00a0 Her kids are rock stars too\u2026) \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/07/10/dont-worry-be-happy/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/03/21/the-long-and-winding-road/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/06/12/lean-on-me/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/henry_storyland.jpg", "http://www.stimeyland.com/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/wonder/", "title": "\n\t\t\tWonder\t\t"},

She asked those of us who support this idea to comment on her letter. I\u2019m asking you too. Here\u2019s the comment I left: Jess speaks for the thousands of us parents out here looking to you to lead the way. Showing your support by \u201cLighting It Up Blue\u201d would not only show parents that you are with us, but our children too. \n Mr. President, my eight year old son needs to see that you understand what we\u2019re going through as a family. His four-year-old brother has autism, and he sees the challenges his brother faces and asks constantly if there\u2019s ways we can help. My oldest child alternates between being frustrated by his brother\u2019s behavior and being protective and supportive. He has done it in silence because he doesn\u2019t want any of his friends to know about his brother. \n But just recently, for the first time ever, he asked his teacher how they were going to commemorate Autism Awareness month in April. For the first time, he\u2019s going public with it. \n Mr. President, if my eight-year-old son wants to Light It Up Blue, don\u2019t you think you can too? If only to show the siblings that autism is nothing to be ashamed of? That there\u2019s nothing more important than supporting their brothers and sisters in their daily struggles? \n Thank you. \nSincerely, Alysia (mother of three boys) Please join the hundreds of people who are urging the President to Light It Up Blue, for just one day.\u00a0 Together, as one voice, we can make a statement for awareness.

TIM :\u00a0 I saw that you reworded that questions.\u00a0 Originally you started with \u201chow did you get so wrong-headed\u201d? ME :\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to be kind. TIM :\u00a0 My opinions have always been strong.\u00a0 Comes from the confidence in knowing that I\u2019m right. ME : Does it bother you that we have different views? TIM :\u00a0 No.\u00a0 I do find yours a bit disturbing at times.\u00a0  (smiling) ME :\u00a0 When I was in the Vermont Legislature before we were married, you were incredibly supportive.\u00a0 Was that hard? TIM :\u00a0 No, we were on the same side of that  debate  (about civil unions).\u00a0 I\u2019m a social liberal.\u00a0 We would have had strenuous debates had you consistently voted to expand government.\u00a0 But I wasn\u2019t living in Vermont, so it wouldn\u2019t have affected me. ME :\u00a0 Speaking of that, would you ever vote for me? TIM :\u00a0 Yes, because you\u2019re a good person.\u00a0 But it would be hard if you were supporting a platform that included the expansion of government. ME :\u00a0 What do you think we\u2019re teaching our kids about politics? TIM :\u00a0 We\u2019re not teaching them anything political.\u00a0 Because we don\u2019t talk about it in front of them. ME :\u00a0 We don\u2019t? TIM : No.\u00a0 Because you tell me not to. ME :\u00a0 Would you consider any of my views a dealbreaker? TIM :\u00a0 Of course not.\u00a0 You can have any wrong-headed opinions you want. (playfully smiles at me again.\u00a0 The smile that made me fall for him all those years ago.) ME :\u00a0 But we agree on the important stuff, right? TIM :\u00a0 No.\u00a0 We agree on stuff that IS important.\u00a0 But there is a lot of important stuff, like fiscal responsibility, that we don\u2019t agree on. ME :\u00a0 Do you know that I end every political conversation with you by saying \u201cOkay, but you\u2019re wrong!\u201d in my head? TIM :\u00a0 Clearly you keep it in your head because you can\u2019t defend it out loud. ME :\u00a0  (laughing)  Do you derive anything positive from us having opposite views? TIM :\u00a0 Other than the general sense that it\u2019s what makes you you? Do  you  get anything positive from it? ME :\u00a0 I do.\u00a0 You wouldn\u2019t be you.\u00a0 It would be boring to just have someone agree with you all the time.\u00a0 Do you frustrate me?\u00a0 Constantly.   Aren\u2019t you glad we\u2019ll always have something to talk about? TIM :\u00a0 We could grow old talking about how evil government is, and I\u2019d be okay with that. (After 15 years he really knows how to push my buttons.  I love this man. ) ME :\u00a0 But you love me, right?

{"date": "March 23, 2011", "body": "Yesterday, an amazing thing happened. Yesterday, a few moms and dads got together, used the power of their combined voices and made a difference. A friend got her copy of the April issue of  Parents  magazine in the mail, and realized that there was no mention at all of April being Autism Awareness Month.\u00a0 No stories, nothing at all.\u00a0 She sent us a note.\u00a0 And posted her dismay on the Parents  Facebook  page. We followed.\u00a0 Many of us did, in fact.\u00a0 We told Parents magazine that we were disappointed.\u00a0 We were sad.\u00a0 We felt that Parents magazine no longer spoke to families like ours.\u00a0 I said I was letting my subscription lapse.\u00a0 They had missed a huge opportunity to connect with families, and maybe help parents who are struggling to understand what\u2019s going on with their kids.\u00a0 Their initial response was that they had an advertisement for a bed tent for children with autism in this issue, and they were planning two online articles. We told them that wasn\u2019t enough.\u00a0 In fact, that was condescending.\u00a0 And even more disappointing. We bombarded them with  Facebook  posts and messages on Twitter. Guess what?\u00a0 They listened. We would like to say again how grateful we are for your feedback and for the reminders in the last 48 hours that autism is not just 1 in 110\u2014it\u2019s about real people and real families. We feel that one of the best ways we can educate our readers and raise awareness for autism is through real-life stories. This is why we want to give you the opportunity to share your story with us and our audience as part of a blog series in addition to our planned articles. If you are interested in participating, please email FacebookSupport@meredith.com with the following information: \n \u2022 Your Name \n\u2022 Child\u2019s Name \n\u2022 Living with Autism: Your Family Story (Please keep stories to 500 words so we can include more voices in the blog.) \n\u2022 Photo of your child/your family (*Optional. We will include one photo if you\u2019d like.) \n\u2022 Link to your personal blog/website (*Optional.) \n We are very sorry for making you and your families feel dismissed or unappreciated. It was not our intention. Autism is an issue worthy of Parents magazine\u2019s attention and we hope we can move forward together to raise awareness throughout April. Is it enough?\u00a0 Not really.\u00a0 It\u2019s still online content only.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a start.\u00a0 We came together with the same message and someone listened. Now it\u2019s time for us to follow through.\u00a0 If you want, send them your story.\u00a0 Let them know that it wasn\u2019t just a few of us.\u00a0 Tell them how autism has changed your life \u2013 the good, the bad and the ugly.\u00a0 Tell them that autism affects the whole family \u2013 mothers, fathers, siblings, aunts, uncles, and grandparents.\u00a0 Tell them how you fight every day for your child to get what he or she needs to get through school and home life.\u00a0 Tell them our kids matter \u2013 that they are special, sensational, amazing human beings that deserve to be highlighted in their magazine now and all the time. And remind them that you hope to see a print version of this next April.\u00a0 Because I\u2019ll be renewing my subscription for one more year.\u00a0 Hoping they do the right thing in 2012.

I don\u2019t get  angry .\u00a0 I get frustrated, annoying and sometimes even a little grouchy.\u00a0 Okay, maybe a lot grouchy.\u00a0 But never angry. Until recently. I\u2019m not sure where this new emotion is coming from.\u00a0 I\u2019m guessing that some of it is  weather related .\u00a0 But not all of it.\u00a0 There are days when it feels like there\u2019s just too much to deal with.\u00a0 Too much to take on. This all came flooding out while I was trying to fold a fitted sheet. Stay with me. I can\u2019t fold a fitted sheet.\u00a0 I have never been able to do it.\u00a0 Tim has tried to teach me many many times.\u00a0 I just can\u2019t.\u00a0 Maybe I don\u2019t have the wingspan to hold the corners just right.\u00a0 Maybe I just don\u2019t have the fine motor skills.\u00a0 Whatever the reason, I can\u2019t do it.\u00a0 So for my entire adult life, fitted sheets have been crumpled up and shoved into the closet on top of all the flat sheets and pillowcases.\u00a0 And I quickly close the door. The other day, I was doing just that.\u00a0 As I was trying to shut the door, the whole pile came out on top of me.\u00a0 And big, ugly, angry tears began to fall as well. In my head, I was screaming at those balled-up sheets, so angry that they had the nerve to fall out and not stay where they were.\u00a0 I started to rattle off all of the other things that were making me angry. \n I\u2019m angry that my almost five year old still won\u2019t sleep through the night and I can\u2019t figure out what else to do. \n I\u2019m angry that my eight year old comes home from school and asks me at least once a week why we can\u2019t do \u201cx\u201d like all his other friends do. (X= take a long family vacation, go to the movies, go to museums, play nicely together) \n I\u2019m angry that I am constantly in the role of \u201cpolice officer\u201d in my house, and I can\u2019t figure out if my two year old has actual behavior problems or if he\u2019s just copying his brother. \n I\u2019m angry that my son does better with his behavior management at school than at home, because of what that implies about my parenting skills. \n I\u2019m angry that there are days that I just can\u2019t help my son manage his body and his sensory issues.\u00a0 And I\u2019m angry at myself for being tired of dealing with it. \n I\u2019m angry that I have friends across town and across the globe who are fighting for their children\u2019s rights to have basic services in our schools.\u00a0 Friends who just want the words in their IEPs followed and not ignored. \n I\u2019m angry that it matters where you live \u2013 that some towns and states are really good at supporting our kids, and some don\u2019t care. \n I\u2019m angry that I have friends who are going through incredibly hard things in their lives \u2013 things that would be difficult anyway, but add in their special needs kids and it\u2019s so much more trying. \n I\u2019m angry that whatever I do, it never seems like enough.\u00a0 There\u2019s never a day when I go to bed and say \u201cwe did everything we needed to do today for our son and his day was right.\u201d \n Apparently I\u2019ve been pretty good at keeping this anger inside, crumpled up behind closed doors like those sheets.\u00a0 But like those sheets, I don\u2019t know what to do with it now that it\u2019s out. My friend at  Diary of a Mom  talked about the need to process our anger, and find the hope and progress interspersed with the raw emotion.\u00a0 She\u2019s right.\u00a0 I see it and  write  about it all the time here.\u00a0 I know how lucky we are in so many ways to have what we do, to live where we live and have the supports that we have. I\u2019m at a crossroads with this anger.\u00a0 Just like with that that sheet.\u00a0 I could try and stuff it back in to the closet, waiting for it to explode on me again.\u00a0 Or I could attempt to fold it.\u00a0 Maybe laying it out flat on the bed and bringing the corners together.\u00a0 Look at it from a different angle.\u00a0 Try something new. I can choose to let it eat at me and become more unhappy, causing misery to those around me.\u00a0 Or I can choose to channel it to make some changes in my life and help others make changes too. Maybe ask for some help. Right now, I\u2019m going to leave the sheet on the floor until I can figure out what to do with it.\u00a0 It can\u2019t stay crumpled up.\u00a0 Because I\u2019m not just angry anymore.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m sad too. \u201c So I start a revolution from my bed \n \u2018Coz you said the brains I had went to my head \n Step outside the summertime\u2019s in bloom \n Stand up beside the fireplace, take that look from off your face \n You ain\u2019t ever gonna burn my heart out So Sally can wait \n She knows it\u2019s too late as we\u2019re walking on by \n Her soul slides away \n \u201cBut don\u2019t look back in anger\u201d, I heard you say\u201d  \u2013 Don\u2019t Look Back In Anger by Oasis \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/somewhere-over-the-rainbow/", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/anger-revisited/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/lets-work-together/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/02/11/dont-look-back-in-anger/", "title": "\n\t\t\tDon\u2019t Look Back In\u00a0Anger\t\t"},

{"date": "February 21, 2011", "body": "Every once in a while, someone comes along that reminds you that there are still good people out there. For me, it\u2019s my son\u2019s special needs van driver. Friday was Howie\u2019s last day on the van until his summer program starts before kindergarten.\u00a0 The van was starting to fill up due to additional eligible students at the elementary school.\u00a0 To alleviate this overcrowding issue, the district asked the preschool to reexamine which kids really needed to ride the van, and which kids could be picked up by their parents. In following the letter of the law, Howie\u2019s disability did not rise to the standard of needing the van for preschool.\u00a0 The \u201cnormal\u201d mode of transportation for the preschool is by car, and Howie\u2019s autism does not affect his ability to ride with me home from school, especially since I was already driving him there.\u00a0 So with an amended IEP assuring us that he would be back on the van for the summer program and for kindergarten (because he cannot ride the regular school bus), we agreed to drive him to and from school until the end of the school year. This was a difficult decision for me.\u00a0 As I wrote in my first post for  Hopeful Parents , the van was my first real public acceptance of his autism.\u00a0 Selfishly, it also gave me an additional 45 minutes each day to myself.\u00a0 Lewis would nap in the afternoon and I could have that time to write, make phone calls or catch up on Glee while I waited for the van to bring Howie home. And Howie loves riding in that van\u2026and the van driver. So on Thursday, right before his last day, I wrote Ms. J (the van driver) this note: I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for everything you\u2019ve done for Howie this year on the van.\u00a0 As you know, Friday will be his last day riding with you until he starts his program for kindergarten.\u00a0 I have yet to tell him, because I know how sad he is going to be. \n I know I said this to you at Christmastime, but I wanted to formally tell you what an important part of Howie\u2019s school life you have been this year.\u00a0 We see you as an extension of his school day, as one of his teachers.\u00a0 Your use of \u201cred\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d choices on the van is consistent with the words he hears in the classroom, and that continuity is so important for him.\u00a0 He has learned incredible social skills while riding with you as he interacts with you and his peers.\u00a0 When he gets home, I hear about Fred the Horse and how salt melts the ice on the road and how many satellites he\u2019s seen that day.\u00a0 All those things have come from you.\u00a0 The ride home with you has been a great transition from his day at school to life at home, and we will all miss seeing you every day. \n I know you don\u2019t usually do the summer van run, but I hope you will be back driving again in the fall.\u00a0 Seeing you pull into the driveway that first morning will help make Howie\u2019s move to kindergarten so much easier.\u00a0 For me and for him, since we will all know he\u2019s in such good hands. \n I\u2019m sending a copy of this letter to the Superintendent, the Transportation director and the head of the preschool with the hopes that they\u2019ll put it in your personnel file.\u00a0 This school district is lucky to have such a caring and loving person on staff.\u00a0 You work with a very special population of kids and some days it can\u2019t be easy.\u00a0 All I know is that you\u2019ve made it very special for us. \n Sincerely, \n Alysia Friday, when she pulled up to drop Howie off for the last time this year, she handed him a package. \u201cHowie! Look!\u00a0 Ms. J. found you a pack of Matchbox cars!\u00a0 One of them has a van in it JUST LIKE Ms. J\u2019s!\u00a0 I got it for you!\u201d. If you know Howie, you know that Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars are the key to his heart.\u00a0 She also gave him his favorite sour apple (organic corn-free) lollipop. His eyes?\u00a0 His eyes were dancing. I thanked her and whisked Howie out of the van before I started to cry. Inside, we opened up the pack of cars.\u00a0 Not only had she found a van that looked just like hers, she had taken the time to open up the box and write these words on it: \u201cMs. J\u2019s Van.\u201d And the name of his school.\u00a0 And Howie\u2019s name, with an arrow leading to his window spot. I can\u2019t make this stuff up: The writing is on top.\u00a0 Trust me.\u00a0 It\u2019s there. Of course, Howie thought this was pretty awesome.\u00a0 I figured it was a good opportunity to tell him that he\u2019d be riding home with me now and that\u2019s why Ms. J gave him the cool van. His response? \u201cNooooooooooooooooooooo! I\u2019m going to kick out your tires!\u201d Any doubt as to how he feels about that van? It\u2019s always the bad stories we hear \u2013 the things that can and do go wrong when our kids aren\u2019t in our care.\u00a0 The stories that make us want to hold our kids close and never let them out of our sight.\u00a0 We always talk about the constant battles that wear us down and wonder why there isn\u2019t someone \u2013 just one person \u2013 who can understand our child and love them for who they are. Howie\u2019s van driver is that person.\u00a0 We\u2019re lucky that she\u2019s one of several amazing people we\u2019ve encountered so far. And I wanted to talk about something good for a change. \u201c Tell me something good (tell me, tell me, tell me) \n  Tell me that you love me \n  Tell me something good (tell me, tell me, tell me) \n  Tell me that you like it, yeah \u201d \u2013 Tell Me Something Good by Rufus and Chaka Khan \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2010/8/17/the-wheels-on-the-bus.html", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_0268.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/tell-me-something-good/", "title": "\n\t\t\tTell Me Something\u00a0Good\t\t"},

{"date": "January 7, 2011", "body": "In my family, we call it the \u201cweepy gene\u201d. It could also be called the \u201ccry in public\u201d gene.\u00a0\u00a0 Or the \u201cwhenever I talk about my family or something emotional, I get teary\u201d gene.\u00a0 Or the \u201cplease don\u2019t ask me to give a toast because I might not get through it\u201d gene.\u00a0 Several members of my extended family have this gene. Not me.\u00a0 I\u2019m not a public crier. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with crying, but doing it around other people is just not something I\u2019m comfortable with.\u00a0 As far as I can remember, there have been only two times in my adult life that I have become so teary that I couldn\u2019t speak \u2013 once at my sister\u2019s Bat Mitzvah, and secondly at the night before my brother\u2019s wedding.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t even cry at my father\u2019s funeral (probably because I let my brother do all the talking that day). Not that I don\u2019t cry.\u00a0 I just end up saving it for the ride home alone.\u00a0 Or in the bathroom.\u00a0 Or in front of Tim (lucky guy). So I certainly wasn\u2019t going to cry during an IEP meeting.\u00a0 Nope, not me. I pulled out all my tricks during the meeting to keep my emotions in check.\u00a0 I fiddled with my pen.\u00a0 I pulled on my sleeves.\u00a0 I broke eye contact when necessary.\u00a0 I counted the days in my head until Spring Training starts. There were two moments when I thought I was in trouble.\u00a0 The first came after his school OT was finished talking.\u00a0 She told us that he had met all his fine motor goals.\u00a0 ALL. HIS. GOALS.\u00a0 This was a kid who until last month couldn\u2019t color, let alone write his name and all the letters.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t hold the pencil right.\u00a0 Now he\u2019s zippering, buttoning, and drawing recognizable shapes and figures.\u00a0 As she got up to leave, I thanked her for all her hard work this year, and told her how grateful I was for all she did. \u201cOh no\u201d, she said.\u00a0 \u201cThis was ALL Howie.\u00a0 He wanted to do this.\u00a0 He wanted to learn.\u00a0 He did this all on his own.\u201d With the tears welling up, I started counting the holes in the ceiling. A few moments later, tears nicely pushed back inside, the team leader asked Howie\u2019s one-on-one aides to talk a little about his progress in the classroom, and what they saw as his strengths and weaknesses.\u00a0 We shared stories, went back and forth about some ideas, and as they stood up to leave, one of them said to us: \u201cWe just love him.\u201d And the tears were back.\u00a0 I whispered a \u201cthank you\u201d as I calculated that there were 51 days until the Red Sox started their season again. I made it through the rest of the meeting on edge but tear-free.\u00a0 We ran through his goals for the rest of preschool and the start of kindergarten, talked about his summer program arrangements, and worked through some of the sensory accommodations that might be necessary for kindergarten to be successful.\u00a0 Right now, at preschool, Howie accesses the OT room almost as soon as he gets into school so that he\u2019s able to function appropriately in the classroom.\u00a0 This means that he misses some valuable social time with his peers during their center time, as he returns just as morning meeting begins.\u00a0 The elementary school OT suggested that he might want to come to kindergarten 15 minutes early, so that if he needs the OT room, he goes before the other kids get there and doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s not part of the school routine.\u00a0 Tim thought that maybe there was a way for him to get that sensory input at home before school started, and we agreed to start using some of our home services to work out a better before-school routine.\u00a0 All of us around the table agreed that the more Howie felt like a full member of the inclusion class, the better it would be for him in the long run. They all thought that with the right accommodations in place, Howie will be ready for kindergarten next year. I left the meeting very proud of myself, having kept those tears at bay. Until we reached the car. I climbed into the driver\u2019s seat and turned to say goodbye to Tim. \u201cYou know,\u201d Tim said, \u201cif we have to get a dumpster to clear out the basement and put a equipment down there for him, we\u2019ll do that.\u201d Cue tears.\u00a0 Cue sobs, actually.\u00a0 Giant ugly body heaving sobs. My poor husband, who has seen this so many times before, knew  exactly what to say . \u201cAre you crying because I said I\u2019d finally clean out the basement?\u201d The joke to make me laugh when all I want to do is cry.\u00a0 We both knew the cries were a mixture of relief and exhaustion.\u00a0 Tears of pride because our son had been doing so well, but also tears because of the road still ahead of us.\u00a0 Tears because we know we had done so much work to get him to be ready for kindergarten next year, but also knowing that there\u2019s so much more we could and should be doing to help him. I pulled myself together on the ride home, and was able to talk coherently with my friend about the meeting when I got back.\u00a0 The tears once again were pushed way down under the surface.\u00a0 Because that\u2019s how I bury the weepy gene. It\u2019s clear now that my son is ready for kindergarten, and  kindergarten will be ready  for him.\u00a0 The question remains, am I the one who isn\u2019t ready?\u00a0 And where will I go to hide the tears on that first day? \u201c And too much time I\u2019ve been spending \n  With my heart in my hands  \n  Waiting for time to come and mend it \n  I can\u2019t cry anymore \u201d \u2013 Can\u2019t Cry Anymore by Sheryl Crow \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/10/07/my-life-would-suck-without-you/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/01/03/never-be-ready/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/01/07/cant-cry-anymore/", "title": "\n\t\t\tCan\u2019t Cry Anymore\t\t"},

This isn\u2019t a B Side post, because while it\u2019s a memory, it\u2019s not a good one.\u00a0 It\u2019s not entirely an autism post either.\u00a0 I guess it\u2019s more of a \u201cme\u201d post.\u00a0 And since I use my blog as free therapy for me, I suppose I\u2019m entitled to a \u201cme\u201d post every once in a while. note:\u00a0 I know members of my family read this blog.\u00a0 I\u2019m giving you warning now that you might not want to read this, and if you do, I won\u2019t want to talk about it later.\u00a0 Because I\u2019m writing about it here instead. Last week of August, 1997 : I\u2019m with my family at the annual summer fair in Vermont.\u00a0 Going to the fair together has been a tradition since I was little, and we always had our family \u201cportrait\u201d taken there.\u00a0 This year, I resisted going.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t because I was ashamed to be seen with my family \u2013 I was 25 years old and past all that.\u00a0 But I was  busy.  I was working in college admissions and we were getting ready for the new school year to start.\u00a0 I had  things to do.  But my parents were insisting that I go.\u00a0 Begging, really.\u00a0 So here we are at Scotty\u2019s photo booth.\u00a0 And we take our picture: It\u2019s our last one. This will be one of the last times I go to the fair.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been a handful of times since this day, and never since I\u2019ve had kids. August 31, 1997:  It\u2019s one o\u2019clock in the morning and I\u2019m sitting in my apartment in my bed watching the news.\u00a0 They are reporting that Princess Diana has died in a car crash.\u00a0 The phone rings and it\u2019s one of my best friends from college.\u00a0 She\u2019s calling to talk about the breaking news of the day and share the conspiracy theories already swirling all over the world. I share with her my breaking news.\u00a0 That afternoon, my parents sat me down to tell me that my father had cancer.\u00a0 Pancreatic cancer.\u00a0 I was awake watching the news because I was afraid to go to sleep.\u00a0 My friend, in her first year of medical school, fell silent on the other end of the phone.\u00a0 She knew what that meant.\u00a0 A five percent survival rate.\u00a0 Months of chemotherapy and other experimental drugs on the horizon.\u00a0 A life changing moment.\u00a0 We hung up and I stayed awake for hours. I still cannot watch footage of Princess Diana\u2019s car crash without thinking of that night.\u00a0 For months after, I would leave SportsCenter on while I fell asleep so I wouldn\u2019t have to be alone with my thoughts. November 12, 1998:  I\u2019m sitting in my parents\u2019 bedroom with my father.\u00a0 We know he doesn\u2019t have much time left.\u00a0 We\u2019ve given up on hospital stays and he\u2019s come home to be surrounded by family.\u00a0 The spreadsheet that I created to track his medications has long been pushed aside since we\u2019re only focused on pain management now.\u00a0 A week prior, he had won re-election to his third time in the Vermont Legislature.\u00a0 I wrote all his campaign material and answered all the candidate surveys.\u00a0 My whole family is at the house.\u00a0 My brother had come home from graduate school to celebrate an early Chanukah, since none of us knew if my dad would be around in December.\u00a0 He had started the journey back to school on this day, but turned around when my sister\u2019s guinea pig \u201cHam\u201d died in the afternoon.\u00a0 He came back to help bury it in the pet burial ground we had on our property.\u00a0 And now, my brother sat downstairs with my mother and sister having dinner, while I stayed upstairs with my dad. I am eating Macaroni and Cheese.\u00a0 We\u2019re watching \u201cMust See TV\u201d.\u00a0 \u201cFriends\u201d is on.\u00a0 My dad is sitting across the room from me in his green recliner.\u00a0 It\u2019s where he chose to be during the times when he could no longer stand being in bed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry (your sister\u2019s) guinea pig died.\u201d The voice came from the chair.\u00a0 Strong and clear.\u00a0 The first coherent sentence I had heard from him in a long time. \u201cI know, Dad.\u00a0 I\u2019ll tell her.\u201d Then, a few moments later, the seizures start. I yell \u201cDad!\u00a0 DAD!\u201d, and then \u201cMOM!!\u00a0 MOM!!\u201d.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t need to call her name.\u00a0 The baby monitor that my mom had on was already sharing what was happening. I yell to her to call my uncle who lives next door.\u00a0 I dial 911. I forget in this moment that 911 had not come to our rural part of the state yet.\u00a0\u00a0 The time it takes for the operator to connect me to our local dispatch seems like hours. I don\u2019t need to give them our address.\u00a0 Just our name.\u00a0 My father had been on our town\u2019s rescue squad for many years.\u00a0 They knew where we were. My mom and uncle usher me out of the room.\u00a0 The ambulance arrives, knocking down the baby gate at the bottom of the stairs that was there to keep the dogs from getting up to my dad.\u00a0 They take him away.\u00a0 My mom, brother and uncle follow.\u00a0 I stay home with my sister. The call came from the hospital a couple of hours later.\u00a0 My dad was gone.\u00a0 \u201cER\u201d was still on the TV upstairs. It\u2019s a year before I can watch \u201cFriends\u201d or \u201cER\u201d again.  The green recliner is now at my house, and is my middle son\u2019s special chair.\u00a0 When the demons of his autism rise up, this is where he retreats.\u00a0 He rocks there.\u00a0 He curls up in the seat of the chair and feels safe.\u00a0 It is his \u201cgreen chair\u201d. I go over those last moments over and over again for the next 12 years.\u00a0 Was there something I could have done differently?\u00a0 Why I was the one in the room with him at that moment?\u00a0 What else could have have said to him before I lost the chance to say anything more? February 17, 2011:  A giant package arrives in the mail addressed to me.\u00a0 I open it and find about 50 pictures inside, sent to me by my cousin.\u00a0 She was helping my 89-year-old Grandma move into a smaller place and thought I\u2019d be a good \u201cmanager\u201d of these photos.\u00a0 I\u2019m waiting for the kids to get home from school, so I have a moment to look through the pictures.\u00a0 The first one I pull out is this one: And all the memories come rushing back. This day would have been my father\u2019s 64th birthday. February 27, 2011:  I start this blog post and the healing process.\u00a0 For the first time, I can write about these memories, although I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to talk about them yet.\u00a0 When I look at that photo I see uncertainty in some faces and blissful ignorance in others.\u00a0 My parents know life is about to change.\u00a0 I do not. That picture made me think about the family I have now and the life-changing event of my son\u2019s autism diagnosis.\u00a0 I wondered if there was a photo of us before our world changed forever.\u00a0 I searched and searched and found this: It was our holiday card for 2009.\u00a0 This was taken three months before our son\u2019s diagnosis.\u00a0 As parents, we knew something was going on.\u00a0 Our kids had no clue. Two life altering events for me.\u00a0 And the photos that trigger the memories. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 I chose the Harry Chapin song \u201cI Wonder What Would Happen To This World\u201d for a reason.\u00a0 Harry Chapin was one of my father\u2019s favorite singer/songwriters.\u00a0 In July 1981 we were overseas on vacation when he read the news of Harry Chapin\u2019s death.\u00a0 I was young, so the memory is fuzzy, but I remember thinking this was one of the first times I had seen my father sad.\u00a0 The lyrics below from this song are on Harry Chapin\u2019s headstone.\u00a0 I often think how different life would be for me now had the two events above not happened \u2013 if my father was still alive and if my son did not have autism.\u00a0 While writing this post, I have realized that it\u2019s useless to think that way.\u00a0 What\u2019s most important is how we take what is given to us and use it to change our corner of the world.\u00a0 To let go of the past trauma and stay in the present.\u00a0 And with that, I hope I can finally move on. \n \u201c Now if a man tried \n To take his time on Earth \n And prove before he died \n What one man\u2019s life could be worth \n Well I wonder what would happen to this world \u201d \u2013 I Wonder What Would Happen To This World by Harry Chapin \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2011/2/11/asd-and-ptsd.html", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2011/02/asd-and-ptsd.html", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/krasnows2.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/krasnows21.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/family.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/i-wonder-what-would-happen-to-this-world/", "title": "\n\t\t\tI Wonder What Would Happen To This\u00a0World\t\t"},

{"date": "March 6, 2011", "body": "\u201cI was just trying to get him out of the house and he had to have his particular pair of shoes\u2026I just wanted to forget about it all for one damn day.\u201d \u2013 Adam Braverman character from the Parenthood episode \u201c Qualities and Difficulties \u201c. Just wanted to forget about it for one damn day. Many families who have kids on the spectrum tuned in to this week\u2019s Parenthood episode.\u00a0 It was previewed as the one where the character Max learns he has Asperger\u2019s.\u00a0 I chatted with many friends of mine before the show \u2013 would we watch?\u00a0 Could we watch?\u00a0 I ultimately decided that I had to watch, and armed myself with a bowl of ice cream and thin mints to make it through. For me, however, the more striking part of the show was not the conversation about Asperger\u2019s.\u00a0 It was a scene in the middle of show between the dad and Max. (slight spoiler alert\u2026I won\u2019t go into details of the scene, but if you haven\u2019t watched the show and plan to, you might want to step away for a moment) In the show, Max\u2019s father Adam was trying to get them out the door for school and Max couldn\u2019t find his shoes.\u00a0 His dad, sensing Max\u2019s rigidity of schedule, decides they will blow off school and spend the day at the amusement park riding roller coasters.\u00a0 The day goes fine until something happens and they can\u2019t ride the coaster.\u00a0 Max has an epic meltdown in the middle of the park, and can\u2019t recover. Later on, when talking to his wife about the day, he says this line : \u201c I just wanted to forget about it all for one damn day.\u201d While I had been teary through most of the show to this point, this is when I really started to cry.\u00a0 This part is what hit home the most for me.\u00a0 Because he wasn\u2019t saying he wanted his son to forget about it for one day, he was saying that HE wanted to.\u00a0 The dad.\u00a0 I knew exactly what he meant. Because I want that too.\u00a0 I just want one day \u2013 one thing \u2013 to be easy. This hit me like a ton of bricks a few weeks ago when Tim went out of town to buy a car.\u00a0 It was in Chicago, so he had to fly out there and then drive the 16 hours back with it.\u00a0 I suggested he take Gerry with him, as a sort of father-son bonding experience.\u00a0 For the trip, I packed a small backpack for Gerry with a change of clothes, a few books, a camera, and a notebook.\u00a0 Tim loaded a few Star Wars movies onto his phone.\u00a0 We told him about the trip about a week ahead of time, and off they went.\u00a0 Easy. If that was Howie, we\u2019d have bags of just food that he can eat, his vitamins, his melatonin, his special music, noise-canceling headphones, several changes of clothes, and two or three social stories. And that\u2019s if we could even get him on the plane.\u00a0 Or into the car.\u00a0 Or, in this case, taking him was not an option at all. We can\u2019t just \u201cpack up and go\u201d.\u00a0 The days that go smoothly \u2013 or that seem to go smoothly \u2013 are the days where I have carefully scripted every single moment.\u00a0 We don\u2019t try anything new.\u00a0 We go to the same restaurants where we know we can eat.\u00a0 We go to the same amusement park every summer because we know it so well and stay in the same hotel.\u00a0 We go to the same playspace every year for his birthday party.\u00a0 We\u2019ve talked about taking a different kind of vacation this summer, but the sheer amount of work involved for all three kids to be happy is paralyzing.\u00a0 If it was just my son, maybe we\u2019d branch out a little more.\u00a0 But his meltdowns don\u2019t just affect him, they affect the whole family. ( I\u2019m sure some of you are thinking that maybe if we didn\u2019t micro-manage everything, that he\u2019d learn to adapt to change.\u00a0 Maybe.\u00a0 Maybe not.\u00a0 Experience tells us otherwise.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on it.\u00a0 I have to be aware of his abilities at 4 years old.\u00a0 And what the rest of my family can absorb at this time.) These thoughts had been swirling around my head when my friend Patty wrote a post called  I Just Want Easy .\u00a0 She wrote that she just wanted one area of her son\u2019s life to go smoothly without any help from her.\u00a0 I understood so completely.\u00a0 In my response to her, I wrote \u201cI feel like the only times when things do go smoothly is when I\u2019ve completely hyper-managed the situation.\u201d And that gets back to the episode of Parenthood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His wife warned him that he was \u201cgoing rogue\u201d, that the change in schedule would be really detrimental to Max\u2019s well being.\u00a0 The dad just wanted a break.\u00a0 For his son and for himself.\u00a0 He just wanted them to be father and son, out at an amusement park, having a good time like all the other families.\u00a0 One family\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d is another family\u2019s \u201cgoing rogue\u201d. I felt this again at a kindergarten information meeting.\u00a0 While all the other parents were worried about their kids remembering their PIN number to buy lunch, I was worried that my son wouldn\u2019t even be able to be in the cafeteria with the noise, smells and people.\u00a0 Other parents wondered where their bus stop would be.\u00a0 I wondered if we\u2019d be able to get out of the house on time to meet the special ed van.\u00a0 One parent was curious how the kids moved from the classroom to gym, art, and the library.\u00a0 I was curious how my son would get his sensory breaks and OT time. \u00a0 Other parents think about the big transition from preschool to kindergarten.\u00a0 I think about every little transition during the day from the moment my son wakes up until he goes to sleep. Sigh. \u201cGoing rogue\u201d.\u00a0 Just for one day.\u00a0\u00a0 Going off script and just doing something crazy.\u00a0 Like wearing different shoes.\u00a0 Or eating a different kind of sandwich.\u00a0 Or sitting in a different chair. I knew parenting wasn\u2019t going to be easy.\u00a0 But, for one day, I\u2019d like it to not be so damn hard. \u201c Take it easy, take it easy  \n  Don\u2019t let the sound of your own wheels  \n  drive you crazy  \n  Lighten up while you still can  \n  don\u2019t even try to understand  \n  Just find a place to make your stand  \n  and take it easy \u201d \u2013 Take It Easy by The Eagles \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nbc.com/parenthood/video/qualities-and-difficulties/1307133/", "http://pancakesgoneawry.blogspot.com/2011/03/i-just-want-easy.html"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/take-it-easy/", "title": "\n\t\t\tTake It Easy\t\t"},
{"date": "January 19, 2011", "body": "Manny the Bear came home from preschool on Thursday.\u00a0 Manny was put down by the front door when we got home that day. And there Manny stayed, all nice and cozy, in his giant blue flower backpack.\u00a0 For four days. Manny is the Build-A-Bear teddy bear that makes the rounds throughout the school year.\u00a0 Every week he is sent home with a different child in the class, complete with changes of clothes, a bed, books, and toiletries.\u00a0 The kids are supposed to take Manny around with them over the weekend like he\u2019s a member of the family.\u00a0 And before he returns to school, the child is supposed to draw a picture of something they did with Manny, and then the parents write a description of the illustration. Yeah.\u00a0 That didn\u2019t happen. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve had Manny visit us.\u00a0 Manny came to stay a few months ago when he was making his first go-around with the class.\u00a0 I was all gung-ho then.\u00a0 Howie and I took Manny out of his backpack, changed his clothes into pajamas, and set up his bed on the floor next to Howie\u2019s.\u00a0 We even pretended to brush his teeth.\u00a0 Then I got all nervous that something would happen to this precious bear if he was on the floor (dog eating/shedding on it, Lewis pulling the arms off or swinging it around, Howie stepping on it during one of his several night-wakings, etc.).\u00a0 So I put Manny up on the dresser, and he stayed there until the weekend was over.\u00a0 That time the assignment was to take a picture of your kid doing something with Manny, so Tim and I hastily took some pictures the morning before Howie brought him back to school.\u00a0 One quick click and there\u2019s Manny and Howie sitting in the chair watching a show.\u00a0 Assignment complete. This time, I didn\u2019t even read the book to find out about the drawing assignment until Sunday evening, when Tim asked me if we were ever planning on taking Manny out of his bag.\u00a0\u00a0 Since Monday was a holiday, I figured we still had plenty of time. Monday came and went.\u00a0 Manny stayed in the backpack. Monday night I asked Howie if he wanted to draw his picture of Manny, since he had to go back to school Tuesday morning. \u201cNo.\u201d, came the answer.\u00a0 And I didn\u2019t push it. Tuesday morning I called the school and asked if we could keep Manny one more day. Tuesday came and went.\u00a0 Manny stayed in the backpack. But that bear was on my mind all day.\u00a0 I passed by that bag every time I went to the bathroom.\u00a0 Shouldn\u2019t I at least open it up and give him some air?\u00a0 But then something would distract me and I\u2019d move on. As we celebrated my birthday Tuesday night, I asked Howie if he wanted to take Manny out to celebrate with us. \u201cNo.\u201d, came the answer.\u00a0 And that was that.\u00a0 Once this kid decides he\u2019s not doing something (or eating something, or going somewhere), that\u2019s it.\u00a0 You cannot change his mind. This morning, it was time to return Manny.\u00a0 And still we had nothing to show for his stay here.\u00a0 I pulled the binder out of his bag (still leaving Manny in there) and dragged Howie over the to table. \u201cWe have to draw a picture of Manny.\u00a0 Let\u2019s draw him with birthday balloons for my birthday.\u201d (Tim said I should have told Howie to draw a stick figure of himself next to Manny\u2019s bag. In hindsight, not a bad idea.) \u201cBut it\u2019s not your birthday anymore!\u201d, cried Howie, which sent him into a tizzy of complaints about not having had any cupcakes for my \u201cparty\u201d.\u00a0 And cries of sadness over  not getting any presents for my birthday. \u201cI\u2019m going to draw squiggle words.\u00a0 It says Happy Birthday Mom thanks for stealing someone else\u2019s birthday.\u201d  (please don\u2019t ask me what that means)  And he proceeded to take the crayon and just draw wavy lines in the box on the paper.\u00a0 And then he turned to me and smiled. \u201cHowie, the directions on your homework say DRAW a picture.\u00a0 It says it right here.\u00a0 That is not a picture\u201d. I handed him a fresh piece of paper. \u201c Stop trying to make me hate you !\u201d And with that, we were done. I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s heard those words before, but he pulled that script out just at the right time.\u00a0 I closed up the binder that had all the other kids\u2019 pictures of Manny and silently put it back in the backpack.\u00a0 With Manny.\u00a0 Howie ran off to run laps around the house with his brother. His teacher happened to call at that moment about something else, and I shared the story of Manny with her.\u00a0 She told me not to worry about it, they would ask him at school if he wanted to do it there and if not, it was no big deal. No big deal.\u00a0 To them.\u00a0 But this was clearly about me. I felt guilty that Manny had stayed in his backpack all weekend.\u00a0 Our life is so chaotic that adding one more member \u2013 even a stuffed furry one \u2013 would have thrown me over the edge.\u00a0 I can barely get my kids dressed some days.\u00a0 Dressing a bear was not going to happen. I felt guilty that we didn\u2019t lead the kind of life that lends itself well to a drawing.\u00a0 Other kids had Manny going to work with their dads, visiting restaurants, and sleeping in their beds.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t set foot outside the house all weekend long.\u00a0 Manny didn\u2019t set foot outside the bag. I felt guilty that I was longing for the kind of life where my kid could sit down and draw a picture of something wonderful that we all did with his classroom bear.\u00a0 This is a kid who has just started to hold a pencil the right way. I started to panic about homework \u2013 even though real homework is still years away.\u00a0 I already battle with my oldest about it.\u00a0 I can\u2019t even imagine how challenging this will be for Howie. And I felt guilty for making him feel bad about what he  did  do on that paper.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We had nothing to draw for Manny, so making something up made no sense to him.\u00a0\u00a0 The wavy lines represented words, and that\u2019s what he wanted.\u00a0 What was wrong with that?\u00a0 Nothing, except that I didn\u2019t want the other parents to see his squiggles.\u00a0 Because I didn\u2019t want them to wonder why my kid couldn\u2019t draw a bear. I can write all I want here about how I\u2019ve come to terms with Howie\u2019s diagnosis, and I\u2019m okay with it all.\u00a0 But sometimes when I see what other kids and families can do, I\u2019m reminded of how different we really are. Howie clearly knew what he was able to do.\u00a0 For me, the battle over what we can and can\u2019t do as a family will rage on for years to come. \u201c People I know, places I go, make me feel tongue-tied \n I can see how people look down, they\u2019re on the inside \n Here\u2019s where the story ends \n People I see, weary of me showing my good side \n I can see how people look down \n I\u2019m on the outside \n Here\u2019s where the story ends \n Ooh here\u2019s where the story ends\u201d  \u2013 Here\u2019s Where the Story Ends by The Sundays \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/mannybear-2010-1.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/heres-where-the-story-ends/", "title": "\n\t\t\tHere\u2019s Where The Story\u00a0Ends\t\t"},
{"date": "January 31, 2011", "body": "My kids play this game called \u201cThe Deep Pit of Darkness\u201d Gerry, my oldest, will lay down on the couch with Howie behind him.\u00a0 The object of the game is for Howie to push Gerry off of the couch onto the floor, or as they call it, the \u201cdeep pit of darkness\u201d.\u00a0 Gerry created this game after I told him that it helped Howie to do certain exercises that involved pushing or heavy lifting.\u00a0 I was thinking more along the lines of, say, wheelbarrow walking or thumb wrestling.\u00a0 My boys interpreted it as \u201cLet\u2019s wrestle while Mom is trying to make dinner.\u201d The \u201cdeep pit of darkness\u201d game keeps them occupied for about 15 minutes, until inevitably someone gets pushed or kicked somewhere that hurts. I realized that I have been in my own deep pit of darkness lately.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not a game. We have had a lot of snow here in southern New England.\u00a0 A lot.\u00a0 I\u2019ve lived in New England for most of my life so snow in winter isn\u2019t usually this depressing.\u00a0 Hell, I\u2019m the girl who used to wait by the bus stop in high school in February with no socks.\u00a0 The college student who walked in -20 degree weather to class with a wet head and no mittens.\u00a0 I\u2019m no stranger to winter.\u00a0 I love living here and am very good at ignoring Facebook posts from friends telling me how nice it is where they live. But this has been a particularly difficult winter in addition to the weather.\u00a0 December brought the one year anniversary of our autism diagnosis.\u00a0 Our annual IEP meeting.\u00a0 And while we have been able to celebrate our progress up to this point, there are still reminders every day how different our lives are now. Add all that to the many snow days and holidays this month, and I felt trapped in my house with three young boys. And yes, I said trapped.\u00a0 Because with 4 feet of snow outside, it felt like the door was closed shut.\u00a0 My claustrophobia kicked in.\u00a0 Like the walls were closing in on me. I felt tired.\u00a0 Tired of reading every detail on this last IEP to make sure all the words are right.\u00a0 Tired of managing the chaos in that runs through this house and ignoring the clutter piled up around me.\u00a0 Tired of pretending to care what we eat for dinner.\u00a0 Tired of feeling like a bad parent because I want my kids to be at school and not home with me.\u00a0 Tired of sitting in front of Lewis trying to get him to repeat my words.\u00a0 Tired of not sleeping.\u00a0 Just tired of everything. I spent much of the last snow day just staring out the window, ice cold coffee in hand.\u00a0 The boys were arguing if it was legal to have a jet pack to get out of the deep pit of darkness.\u00a0 As I watched the giant snowflakes endlessly fall from the sky, I too was hoping for some way to escape this pit.\u00a0 I closed my eyes and imagined Dorothy\u2019s ruby slippers on my feet, and wondered what it would be like to just click my heels and be\u2026 anywhere but here. I went to bed that night with a headache.\u00a0 The snowy weather forecast for the next week weighed heavily on my mind. The next day the sun was out, but my mood was still in the dark pit.\u00a0 It was affecting everyone in the house.\u00a0 My husband came in from walking the dog and said \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u00a0 We\u2019re going out.\u201d I had asked the boys several times if they wanted to go play in the snow.\u00a0 The answer was always no.\u00a0 But my husband didn\u2019t ask.\u00a0 He told them.\u00a0 End of story. My mood got darker and darker through the 20 minute adventure of getting dressed for outside.\u00a0 Five sets of coats, boots, mittens, hats and snowpants had to be uncrumpled from the bottom of the closet from our last journey out together.\u00a0 Once outside, the snow was so deep that with every step I had to pull Lewis back up again. With every step, he laughed. And soon, I was laughing too. My husband got out our blue plastic sled and put Howie and Lewis in it.\u00a0 He pulled them around the track he made in the yard and they squealed with delight.\u00a0 Gerry and I ran around behind them, trying to push each other down into the deep snow.\u00a0 A game I was winning, until my husband came up and hip-checked me right into a snowbank. There I was.\u00a0 Stuck in a deep pit of white. And behind me?\u00a0 A melody of giggles and calls for \u201cdo it again!\u201d Snuggling in bed that night, I asked Howie what his favorite thing was that day (as I always do). \u201cI liked playing with you.\u00a0 I love you.\u201d Won't bury himself in sand, but snow?  No problem I whispered back \u201cI love you too.\u201d\u00a0 And closed my eyes again. I didn\u2019t need the ruby slippers to remind me that there\u2019s no place like home. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \u201c Somewhere over the rainbow \n Skies are blue \n And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true \n Someday I\u2019ll wish upon a star \n And wake up where the clouds are far behind me \n Where troubles melt like lemon drops \n Away above the chimney tops \n That\u2019s where you\u2019ll find me \u201d \u2013 Over the Rainbow from The Wizard of Oz \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/168185_1831423631965_1431616213_32080331_2977890_n.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/somewhere-over-the-rainbow/", "title": "\n\t\t\tSomewhere Over the\u00a0Rainbow\t\t"},

{"date": "February 6, 2011", "body": "When I get a phone call from school during school hours,\u00a0 I get a little knot in my stomach. When I get that call from preschool at the end of the school day, the knot gets a little bigger. So when the phone rang at 2:45pm last week and it was the preschool, I almost didn\u2019t answer it.\u00a0 I really didn\u2019t want to know. But I did.\u00a0 Because I\u2019m not  that  bad of a mom. It was the lead teacher of the special education classroom.\u00a0 \u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d she said.\u00a0 (Because she probably heard the fear in my \u201cHello?\u201d) \u201cI just wanted to give you a heads up.\u00a0 Howie was really upset when he got on the van at the end of school.\u00a0 He had made a ship out of bristle blocks and it fell apart right before cleanup time.\u00a0 We tried to help him put it back together, but he was too upset.\u201d Damn you bristle blocks!  I have to interject here that bristle blocks have become my least favorite toy in the house.\u00a0 We got them originally when Howie\u2019s fine motor skills needed some help and he would get incredibly frustrated building with regular blocks or even Lego Duplos.\u00a0 They were great.\u00a0 At first.\u00a0 Now that he can build, he wants his creations to be perfect and look perfect.\u00a0 And stay together.\u00a0 Not a strong point of the bristle block. His teacher continued.\u00a0 \u201cHe was really mad.\u00a0 The maddest I\u2019ve ever seen him.\u00a0\u00a0 He was refusing to get on the van and just kept repeating how mad he was.\u00a0 He did eventually get on the van to come home, but he lost his \u2018earning\u2019 for the afternoon.\u00a0 If we had had more time we could have worked through it with him, but we were at the end of the day.\u00a0 It was too bad because he was having a terrific day up until that point.\u00a0 I just wanted to warn you.\u00a0 We\u2019ve never seen him like this.\u201d Oh I have.\u00a0 For a while we struggled with emotions in our house.\u00a0 Howie would have screaming crying meltdowns but couldn\u2019t tell us why.\u00a0 Now he can verbalize it.\u00a0 Sort of.\u00a0 Mostly it involves him stomping around the house for a very long time with his arms crossed, mouth clenched and tears in his eyes, accompanied by the \u201cI\u2019M SO MAD AT YOU!!!\u201d screams. I thanked her for the information as the van came down the street.\u00a0 I grabbed my boots and rushed out.\u00a0 Last time we had such an incident, I could see his face pressed up against the van window crying as it came down the road.\u00a0 I wanted to get out there as fast as I could. This time, he was sitting still in his seat.\u00a0 His coat was lying across his lap.\u00a0 And his face said it all. \u201cI heard all about it,\u201d I told the van driver.\u00a0 \u201cI know what happened.\u201d \u201cBut he pulled it together.\u00a0 He\u2019s even earning his special van treat!\u201d, she said back, with a smile on her face. I pulled Howie off the van with his arms still crossed.\u00a0 He refused to come in the house even though it was 10 degrees outside. \u201cI\u2019M MAD!\u201d he yelled. \u201cI know,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cBut please come inside.\u00a0 At least into the garage.\u201d He gave me that much.\u00a0 And after a few minutes, he found his way in. \u201cI\u2019m mad because my ship broke.\u201d\u00a0 His tears came back. \u201cI know, sweetie.\u00a0 Maybe tomorrow you can work on it again.\u201d\u00a0 And I just left that there.\u00a0 I\u2019ve learned.\u00a0 Any more discussion would just add fuel to the fire. About an hour later, Gerry asked Howie how his day was.\u00a0 Out of the blue. I held my breath. \u201cI was mad because my ship broke and I didn\u2019t earn.\u201d Gerry looked at him for a minute.\u00a0 \u201cDo you want me to help you make it again here?\u201d Still holding my breath.\u00a0 Waiting for the explosion. \u201cOk.\u201d Howie said.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not mad anymore.\u201d I looked at the clock.\u00a0 It was 4:30pm.\u00a0 I made a mental note to mark this day down in history. Gerry got the container of bristle blocks and dumped them out on the floor.\u00a0 And together all three boys made their own new ships. I just sat back and watched. Later that night, I sent his teachers this e-mail: \n Just wanted to let you all know how things turned  out this afternoon.\u00a0 He turned it around on the van (J. even let him earn his  pop), and came in a little mad (but acted fine).\u00a0 But around 4:30pm, he said  \u201cI\u2019m not mad anymore\u201d.\u00a0 Gerry asked him why he was mad in the first place and Howie explained about the problem with the ship.\u00a0 Gerry asked him more about  it and Howie said \u201cmaybe I could\u00a0 make it again here.\u201d\u00a0 Gerry told him he\u2019d  help figure out what went wrong with the ship the first time.\u00a0 And while they  couldn\u2019t make the exact ship, Gerry, Lewis and Howie all made ships together to  fly around.\u00a0 Success.\u00a0 Pictures attached to prove it. \n (well, until Howie bashed into Gerry\u2019s belly with  his ship, but it all can\u2019t be good all the time \ud83d\ude09 ) \n thank you for working this through with him.\u00a0 He  just needed some time to process it all.  \n And here are those pictures to prove it. \n \n There is my permanent record of progress.\u00a0 A year ago \u2013 a month ago? \u2013 this could have ruined the whole day for the whole family.\u00a0 But as a team \u2013 at school and at home \u2013 we solved it together.  \n I\u2019m still putting away the bristle blocks though.\u00a0 I don\u2019t need that kind of stress. \n  \u201c Together we\u2019ll stand \n Divided we\u2019ll fall \n Come on now people \n Let\u2019s get on the ball \n And work together \n Come on, come on \n Let\u2019s work together \u201d \u2013 Let\u2019s Work Together by Canned Heat \n \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/bristleblock1.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/bristleblock1.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/bristleblock2.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/lets-work-together/", "title": "\n\t\t\tLet\u2019s Work Together\t\t"},

{"date": "April 6, 2011", "body": "I saw a different side of awareness the other day. I was in the car with two friends, driving to an autism resource fair.\u00a0 It was Saturday, April 2nd.\u00a0 World Autism Awareness Day.\u00a0\u00a0 My friend in the driver\u2019s seat has a child with Asperger\u2019s.\u00a0 My other friend\u2019s son was diagnosed this past fall with PDD-NOS.\u00a0 He\u2019s three. My friends were in the front seat talking about running and other such things.\u00a0 I was enjoying sitting in the back seat alone, something I rarely get to do. I tuned back into the conversation when I heard my friend in the passenger seat say \u201cDid you know that the  Boston Garden  had blue lights on for autism?\u201d I looked up and caught the eye of my other friend in the rear view mirror.\u00a0 She smiled at me.\u00a0 She knew I knew.\u00a0 Because I had written about it  here .\u00a0 And  here .\u00a0 And  here  too. \u201cAsk Alysia\u201d, she said. \u201cShe has a blue shirt on today.\u201d My friend turned around to me.\u00a0 \u201cYou know about this?\u201d \u201cI do, \u201d I said.\u00a0 I explained that April was Autism Awareness Month, and that as part of the \u201c Light It Up Blue \u201d campaign, landmarks all over the world were turning on blue lights.\u00a0 I rattled off the list:\u00a0 Fenway Park, the Prudential Building, the Empire State Building, the Sydney Opera House, the statue of Jesus in Brazil\u2026 \u201cThey were even trying to get the White House to turn blue for the day.\u201d\u00a0 I said. My friend\u2019s eyes grew wide.\u00a0 And they got teary. All she could do was mouth the word \u201cwow\u201d to me.\u00a0 And then she turned around and was quiet for a moment. Right then I realized the importance of the \u201cLight It Up Blue\u201d campaign.\u00a0 Yes, it\u2019s just a symbol.\u00a0 But for a mother who is still struggling with everything related to her son\u2019s diagnosis, it meant much more than that.\u00a0 It showed her that for one day the world stood with her.\u00a0 And as she attempts to understand what is happening with her child and as she fights to get her son all the help and services he needs, she now knows that there are others fighting along side her.\u00a0 All over the globe. Light It Up Blue Before this, I thought of the awareness campaign as a way to help people not connected to autism learn more about it.\u00a0 My friend reminded me that it\u2019s also about showing people  within  the community that they are not alone.\u00a0 That there are others who understand and will accept her son as he is.\u00a0 That we will be here to help her get through the difficult days.

{"date": "April 1, 2011", "body": "Today, for the start of Autism Awareness Month, I won\u2019t be sharing our story. Today, I\u2019ll be turning the page over to some amazing friends of mine.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t bloggers or activists in the autism community.\u00a0 They are moms. Superhero Moms.\u00a0 Moms who wear their capes twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\u00a0 They are people I know in my  real everyday \u201csee you at the supermarket\u201d life. I asked them to share with me some words of wisdom.\u00a0 \u201cCan you tell me in a few sentences how your child\u2019s diagnosis has changed you as a parent?\u00a0 The good and/or the bad.\u201d Because if you want true awareness and understanding and acceptance for those of us living with autism, you have to listen to everyone.\u00a0 Truly listen. J. (mom of two boys, one with autism)  :\u00a0 for the worst\u2026. it made me re-live those insecurities of high school and made me worry that my kid would be the one that other kids made fun of. But then it made me \u201cgrow up\u201d and re-define \u201cnormal\u201d and try to make sure that I think from HIS perspective not mine\u2026getting him into the best environment for him and teaching myself how to verbally and non-verbally communicate the way that works best for him. I honestly struggle with my temper and my patience daily but my son and my friends that I have found through this experience are my rock that gives me strength everyday. \nFor the best\u2026. I have a new found strength to share my story with other moms I meet in case it can help them help their kids. Autism isn\u2019t easily defined like I used to think and there are so many families that may have that \u201cfeeling\u201d that their kids need \u201csomething\u201d but they just don\u2019t know what or where to turn \u2013 I say trust your gut.\u00a0 All the skills that I have learned to help my autistic son are just as affective on my \u201ctypical\u201d son and I think it has made me a better communicator. A. (mom of two boys, one with autism)  : To say that our son\u2019s diagnosis was a bit of a shock to us would be an understatement.\u00a0 When his doctor started talking about looking into ABA, I thought she was talking about the American Bar Association at first, because that was all I had as a reference point.\u00a0 Life sure has changed in almost 3 years.\u00a0 I think I look at life with a completely different set of lenses now that I\u2019ve started this journey with him.\u00a0 He has taught me to slow down, and not to rush from one thing to the next just to get through it.\u00a0 And, that I don\u2019t have to go it alone \u2013 it\u2019s okay to lean on others for help.\u00a0 I think I have a better relationship with my husband and family because of my son, and I know for a fact I have girlfriends I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise!\u00a0 He has taught me that all accomplishments in life should be celebrated, regardless of size.\u00a0 He has taught me empathy \u2013 it takes all kinds to make the world go round, and everybody is put here for a reason.\u00a0 Everybody.\u00a0 And, he has taught me to be a better parent to my older son , and show him what it truly means to be empathetic, understanding, and patient. T. (mom of one boy with autism)  : I would like  to say that Autism has made me stronger.\u00a0 Or more patient.\u00a0 Or able to  appreciate the little things in life.\u00a0 The truth is, Autism has created a  dark cloud over my family that follows us around day in and day out.\u00a0  No matter what, it is there as a constant reminder of our son\u2019s autism,  and the worry never goes away.\u00a0 The silver lining for me is that I have  met an amazing group of friends who are always there to lend their  support and brighten my day.\u00a0 But what breaks my heart every day is  wondering where the sliver lining is for my son, who must live with  autism the rest of his life.\u00a0 My hope is that someday he finds it. J. (mom of a girl and a boy, daughter has autism ) : An autism diagnosis to me was a period of many different feelings.\u00a0 In a somewhat abbreviated version I suppose it started with: Tears, and a sinking stomach.\u00a0 Questions of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d ?\u00a0 Nights spent on the internet reading and researching.\u00a0 An eventual calming and acceptance of a new life challenge and remembering, things could be a lot worse. Then an overwhelming feeling of appreciation \u2013 for the help we found was available to help overcome these obstacles that lead to this diagnosis in the first place.\u00a0 Then over time, less focus on that \u2018word\u2019 and more focus on the childhood and memories we want to give them, and watch unfold before us and they grow into their own little person. To present day\u2026..very little daily focus on that autism diagnosis 2 years ago\u2026 to just immersing ourselves in the day to day lives we have as a family, and trying to do the best we know how to raise our children the right way while trying to keep meeting and hopefully beating any more challenges that may lie ahead of us. A. (mom of a girl and a boy, son has autism)  When my son was first diagnosed in 2007 we were shocked, just by the reality of it.\u00a0 We knew something was different, but the reality of it knocked the wind out of us.\u00a0 My husband, out of a sense of protecting our son and our family, did not speak of it to anyone outside of the family.\u00a0 At work he kept his usual professional demeanor but inside he was concerned, worried about our son and what kind of life he would have, about our marriage because of the high divorce rate in parents of autistic children, and about our daughter, because of the focus our son would need.\u00a0\u00a0 It was easier for me not to speak of it because I work from home, with a flexible job.\u00a0 For my husband, while this did not affect his everyday job, it affected his military standing. \nWhen my husband was doing his outprocessing he told them he had an autistic son.\u00a0 His supervisors were shocked \u2013\u00a0 he knew by their reaction and their words, that if had they known he would have been given a heads up that he forgot to do this or that, and would be given extra time.\u00a0 That lesson showed both my husband and I that we needed to be open about our son, and not try and protect him because it could hurt us as a family.\u00a0\u00a0 Since then, we have been open and honest about our son, and his being different. \nMy husband is now in the Army Reserves, and during a recent ceremony our son had anxiety about being there with all the people and had frequent verbal outbursts before my daughter graciously took him out in the hall to look out the window at cars.\u00a0 For once, my husband and I were not embarrassed because everyone in that room knew about our son and his uniqueness.\u00a0 Having a son like ours has taught us about being open and honest about who we are as a family, and as individuals. and finally,  my friend Hope *.\u00a0  Remember Hope ?\u00a0 She was the one who was there for me from the beginning.\u00a0 The one who guided me and listened to me and showed me the path to understanding and acceptance. Hope* (mom of four, one son with autism)  : As a parent, I am more understanding and patient than I have ever been.\u00a0 Not just of my own child, but of others around me.\u00a0 Before the diagnosis, I would ask myself, \u201cwhat am I doing wrong here?\u00a0 Nothing is working.\u201d\u00a0 After the diagnosis, I found the tools I needed to deal with my child, which in turn, made things much better for my whole family.\u00a0 I was doing a lot less yelling.\u00a0 Everyone benefited from that.\u00a0 I used to feel a lot of guilt around the amount of time and attention my child was getting from me.\u00a0 I have 3 other children.\u00a0 I finally decided to let that go.\u00a0 Yes, he needs a little more than the others at times, but I think they know that.\u00a0 We are all doing the best we can.\u00a0 As a family, we have never really known any different than the way things are now.\u00a0 Yes, we got a diagnosis, but things haven\u2019t changed too much.\u00a0 We try to be supportive of each other as best we can.\u00a0 I find that my other children are a huge support for their brother.\u00a0 They understand him and often go with the flow with him.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I would change a thing about any of them or how our family is as a whole. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Awareness can and should happen every day.\u00a0 But today, we\u2019ll be just a little more aware. Our house will be lit up with blue lights. Today, my boys and I will be wearing blue. We wear blue for the 1 in 110 children affected by autism. We wear blue for the 1 in 88 military children living with autism. We wear blue for the hundreds of children who will be diagnosed this month. We wear blue for my friends\u2019 children. We wear blue for my son. And that is our story. My Boys In Blue \u201c All of these lines across my face \n  Tell you the story of who I am \n  So many stories of where I\u2019ve been \n  And how I got to where I am \n  But these stories don\u2019t mean anything \n  When you\u2019ve got no one to tell them to \n  It\u2019s true\u2026I was made for you\u2026 You see the smile that\u2019s on my mouth \n  It\u2019s hiding the words that don\u2019t come out \n  And all of my friends who think that I\u2019m blessed \n  They don\u2019t know my head is a mess \n  No, they don\u2019t know who I really am \n  And they don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve been through like you do \n  And I was made for you\u2026 \u201d \u2013 The Story by Brandi Carlile \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/06/12/lean-on-me/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/07/19/youve-got-a-friend/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/boysinblue.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/the-story/", "title": "\n\t\t\tThe Story\t\t"},
{"date": "April 11, 2011", "body": "If a blog has a birthday and its frazzled overwhelmed writer misses it, does she get kicked out of the blogging club? According to my e-mail archives, I\u2019ve been writing this blog for over a year now, since March 23rd, 2010.\u00a0 And I didn\u2019t even know it.\u00a0\u00a0 I guess I thought WordPress would send me an e-mail.\u00a0 Something like \u201cHey!\u00a0 Guess what!\u00a0 We\u2019ve been hosting your little blog for a year now for free\u2026when are you going to upgrade and send us some money?\u201d I need reminders like that or I miss things.\u00a0 Or maybe I just need a personal assistant. Anyway, on the occasion of this blog\u2019s 55th week in existence, I thought I\u2019d take a little look back. I had written a few things before starting this blog last year, including a piece for  The Boston Globe Magazine  and one for Autism Speaks, which is now included in their  100 day Kit .\u00a0 There was something cathartic about sharing our story for the first time.\u00a0 I was finding that I needed a space to write more, just to get the words out of my head.\u00a0 At this point, we were only three months into my son\u2019s autism diagnosis. Through my extensive research on autism (thank you Google), I came across so many stories that felt like my  own .\u00a0 People sharing bits and pieces of their  daily lives .\u00a0 And with each one I read, I  cried more . One day I was reading a story about sensory processing disorder, and there was a link to  Hartley\u2019s Life With 3 Boys .\u00a0 As I clicked around her site, I felt right at home.\u00a0 Her life with her three boys was very similar to mine.\u00a0 And she was looking for people to join her  SPD Blogger Network . So I did.\u00a0 And this blog was born. In these 55 weeks, so much has happened.\u00a0 The  SPD Blogger Network  has now blossomed into its own site, and I\u2019m proud to be a writer there and its newsletter editor.\u00a0 I\u2019m also lucky enough to be a contributing writer to  Hopeful Parents  and on  Hartley\u2019s  site itself, and on our local  autism resource center\u2019s blog .\u00a0 I helped a friend launch her  Special Needs Sibling Saturday . I joined with friends to strongly (*ahem*) encourage  Parents Magazine  to include real life family stories for Autism Awareness month. But the best part about this year has been meeting all the incredible members of this community.\u00a0 When I started writing, I felt so alone.\u00a0 Now I\u2019m part of a family.\u00a0 I can get up in the morning and know that at least 20 \u2013 30 people have my back.\u00a0 I have people I can turn to when things are tough, and friends who understand the importance of the small things.\u00a0 The writers that I have met along the way aren\u2019t just faceless people who post comments \u2013 they are my lifeline.\u00a0 There are my  Facebook  friends now.\u00a0 My  Twitter  buddies (no, I still can\u2019t say \u201ctweeps\u201d).\u00a0 Many of them I have now met in real life and many more I hope to meet very soon. Because of them, I can breathe again.\u00a0 I can get out of bed.\u00a0 I can laugh and cry and not feel like I\u2019m the only one. Because of them, this blog has changed my life.\u00a0 I would be lost without these incredible people. Many of them are listed on the sidebar of my home page under \u201cYou\u2019re the Inspiration\u201d.\u00a0 It may be a cheesy Chicago song, but it\u2019s completely true. I could use this space to list off my favorite posts, but every post is special to me in its own way.\u00a0 So I\u2019m taking a page here from my friend  Spectrummy Mummy . \nIn the interest of awareness and paying it forward, choose a blog from my  list .\u00a0 I have learned so much from the people behind those titles.\u00a0 Instead of leaving a comment here, click on any one of them and meet someone new.\u00a0 Then share it with a friend. I\u2019ll end with this.\u00a0 The one thing that has not changed over this past year has been the reason why I write.\u00a0 I write for these incredible boys.\u00a0 They are my world.\u00a0 They are the ones that have taken me on this incredible journey.\u00a0 We defy gravity together.

Not for Howie.\u00a0 It has been Hot Wheels and Storyland.\u00a0 Always.\u00a0 Never changing. It\u2019s led me to have a love/hate relationship with those two things.\u00a0 I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s because it\u2019s how we first saw those red flags of autism. Let me start with Storyland.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been going there for years, ever since Gerry was three and before Howie was born.\u00a0 Yes, Gerry loved it there \u2013 the place is amazing and designed for kids ages 1-10.\u00a0 But he didn\u2019t talk about it  all the time .\u00a0 The year we went with Howie when he was two, it was all he could talk about.\u00a0 He studied the map like it was the Bible.\u00a0 He knew where every ride was and which ones he wanted to go on, and which ones he was going to avoid.\u00a0 From June 2008 to now, he asks us constantly to go back. I\u2019ll admit I use it to my advantage.\u00a0 I told him to read it on the toilet when we were toilet training because I knew he would sit longer.\u00a0 When I needed him to calm down, I\u2019d spread it out on the floor, point out the \u201cFlying Shoes\u201d ride on the map, and I knew I\u2019d have a good 10 minutes to clean up, check my e-mail, or make some coffee.\u00a0 I tried to use it as a way to show the changing seasons, as in \u201cwe can\u2019t go to Storyland now because there\u2019s snow on the ground, but when the snow is gone, we can go\u201d. I didn\u2019t bet on the lack of snow last year in New England, so the lesson then was lost. The obsession with Storyland wouldn\u2019t be enough of a red flag on its own if it wasn\u2019t also accompanied by the Hot Wheels car craze.\u00a0 With three boys, our house is covered in vehicles.\u00a0 We have hundreds of Hot Wheels cars.\u00a0 We first started collecting them when Gerry was little, used as a incentive for toilet training.\u00a0 Somewhere around 18 months, Howie became attached to the cars and never let go.\u00a0 It\u2019s all he ever wanted to play with.\u00a0 And because he would sit for long periods of time with them, lining them up and watching their wheels move back and forth, I let him.\u00a0 Just like with the Storyland map, it was the only way I could get anything done.\u00a0 I\u2019d encourage it. It wasn\u2019t until our meeting with the developmental pediatrician last year that I realized this was a \u201csign\u201d.\u00a0 A flag.\u00a0 Howie rolled a car back and forth on her desk for 10 minutes while she talked to me.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t even notice that he was doing it.\u00a0 I did notice her eyes watching him the whole time.\u00a0 When she told me later that this was his \u201cstimming\u201d, I was floored. All of this is making me watch Lewis like a hawk with these monster trucks.\u00a0 I panic slightly when he lines them up on the rug, then breathe when he pulls them out of line immediately to race around the rug.\u00a0 I feel my stomach go into knots when I catch him lying on the floor watching the wheels move, then relax when he leaves the truck there to go play with something else.\u00a0 I watch for the long extended meltdowns when he can\u2019t find a truck, and wonder if he\u2019ll get mired in all things Monster Jam.\u00a0 So far, it\u2019s not the same.\u00a0 Lewis can easily move from playing with the monster trucks to serving me tea from his pretend kitchen to demanding to hear more music from the Glee soundtracks.\u00a0 That last one I\u2019ll indulge at any time. But not Howie.\u00a0 It\u2019s still all about the Hot Wheels and Storyland.\u00a0 Just yesterday he asked me if I could open up Storyland so we could go.\u00a0\u00a0 And for Hanukkah, we got him a special Hot Wheels backpack that opens up into a racetrack mat.\u00a0 He packed it full of his favorite 50 or so cars to \u201csave to race in the basement\u201d.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have a finished basement.\u00a0 It\u2019s just something he says. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right to continue to feed his obsession or not.\u00a0 All I know is that he loves those cars.\u00a0 And Storyland.\u00a0 In a world that can be so difficult for him, is it wrong for us to deny him the things that make him feel\u2026happy? Time to go.\u00a0 Two more nights of Hanukkah and I have a few more monster trucks, Hot Wheels cars and Star Wars figures to wrap. \u201c You are an obsession  \n I cannot sleep  \n I am your possession  \n Unopened at your feet  \n There\u2019s no balance  \n No equality  \n Be still I will not accept defeat \u201d \u2013 Obsession by Animotion \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/obsession/", "title": "\n\t\t\tObsession\t\t"},

{"date": "December 11, 2010", "body": "It started with paper snowflakes. We were all over at our friend\u2019s house for a pizza party, and Gerry and his friend were creating paper snowflakes.\u00a0 They made them in all shapes and colors and pretended to sell them to us from their \u201cartificial snowflake store\u201d. On our way home, Gerry was working on one of his money making schemes, trying to figure out how to make $400 \u2013 enough to buy the Lego Death Star. \u201cIf I sold one paper snowflake for a penny, how many would I need to sell?\u201d Tim and I started to do the math with him in the car when he interrupted us. \u201cCould I sell them for charity?\u201d Of course, we answered, knowing that there would be very few people who would buy an eight-year-old\u2019s artwork, but we were going with it.\u00a0 I started to explain what a charity was to give him some ideas.\u00a0 People donated to charities for causes that they believed in.\u00a0 There were charities to help people who didn\u2019t have enough money to eat, charities to help the environment, and charities to help find cures for diseases. \u201cIs there a charity to find a cure for autism?\u201d I exchanged sideways glances with Tim.\u00a0 \u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cThen I want to do that one\u2026\u201d (my eyes are getting teary at this point) \u201c\u2026because I want them to find a cure since Howie\u2019s been getting a little wild lately.\u201d (gut punch.\u00a0 Eight year old sibling gives and takes away) We quickly ended the conversation in the car and I told him we\u2019d talk about it more when we were home. A few hours later we were getting the boys ready for their showers.\u00a0 Gerry was sitting with me in Lewis\u2019 room while Howie was with Tim.\u00a0 I told Gerry why we needed to end the conversation in the car. \u201cHowie doesn\u2019t know he has autism, so I didn\u2019t want him to get confused or upset by what we were saying in the car.\u00a0 He\u2019s too young to understand.\u201d \u201cWell, when will he know?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I told him, \u201cMaybe when he\u2019s older like you he\u2019ll know.\u00a0 But right now we don\u2019t want him thinking that he\u2019s any different than anyone else.\u201d As soon as it came out, I knew those words were a mistake. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being different?\u201d, Gerry asked. I started to backpedal.\u00a0 The whole \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with being different\u201d phrases started stumbling out of my mouth. \u201cI feel different because I\u2019m Jewish.\u00a0 Everyone else in this town celebrates Christmas.\u00a0 And you tell me there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d (what continued here for a bit was a deep religious and spiritual conversation that I was not ready to have with an eight year old.\u00a0 Started something along the lines of \u201cbut my friends who had their first communion got thousands of dollars\u201d and moved to \u201chow come Dad isn\u2019t Catholic anymore?\u201d\u00a0 But that\u2019s a blog post in itself\u2026\u201d) After his brothers were in bed, I went into Gerry\u2019s room and sat down on his bed. \u201cI chose the the wrong word when I said I didn\u2019t want Howie to think he was different.\u00a0 You\u2019re right, it\u2019s good to be different and we should celebrate those differences.\u201d He looked at me thoughtfully.\u00a0 \u201cYeah, being different is good. You wouldn\u2019t want to dress the same and act the same way as your best friend, because then no one would want to be your friend because they would all think you were just copying him.\u201d He continued with \u201cThere\u2019s good different and bad different.\u00a0 Good different would be if someone had a hard time paying attention in class and they needed something like a pencil to fidget with to help them, that would be ok.\u00a0 But if someone wasn\u2019t paying attention just to be annoying, that wouldn\u2019t be ok.\u201d Right, I said.\u00a0 People learn in different ways and sometimes need things to help them with their attention.\u00a0 But if someone was disturbing the class just to be funny, that wouldn\u2019t be good. Gerry paused for a minute to think about this. \u201cIs Howie in a special class for kids with autism?\u00a0 Is there a group for kids like him to get together like I do for SibShop?\u201d I explained that Howie was in an inclusion class at his preschool with kids of all different abilities and he meets with his teachers and other kids to learn special skills to help him pay attention in class and at home.\u00a0 Different from SibShop, I said, but still learning important coping skills just like Gerry was in his group. \u201cAre they helping Howie to stop making all his noises?\u201d Big sigh.  \u201cYes,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cHe makes those noises when his body doesn\u2019t feel right and they are helping him understand what to do with his body when he feels that way.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on that at home too.\u00a0 So when we see his body moving really fast or he\u2019s making a lot of noises, we let him run laps in the house, or get his weighted blanket.\u00a0 Or have a pillow fight with him.\u00a0 Those things make his body feel better.\u201d Gerry looked at me quizzically.\u00a0 \u201cPillow fights help him feel better?\u201d \u201cThey do.\u00a0 So if you see him moving really fast in his chair or making a lot of noises, you can always ask him if he wants to have a pillow fight.\u00a0 Not a really rough one, but a gentle one.\u00a0 It might help him.\u201d He was quiet for a few minutes. \u201cWhat if I invented a machine that was a big circle loop and pillows hung from it?\u00a0 It would go around in a circle and Howie could stand in it and get hit by the pillows. That would help him, right?\u00a0 I would make sure it was 2 feet off the ground so if he fell he wouldn\u2019t keep getting hit by the pillows.\u201d (getting teary again) \u201cI think that\u2019s a great invention.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love it.\u201d \u201cProbably pretty expensive to make, though,\u201d he said, pulling the covers up to his neck.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll have to think about it more.\u201d The next morning, I came downstairs to find blue paper snowflakes all over the kitchen table.\u00a0 And as I sat in the chair, rocking Howie and squeezing him with all my strength, Gerry worked furiously with the scissors making all different patterns of snowflakes. \u201cYou know, Mom.\u00a0 No two snowflakes are alike.\u00a0 They are all different.\u201d That is something to celebrate. \u201c The road is long  \n With many a winding turn  \n That leads us to who knows where  \n Who knows where  \n But I\u2019m strong  \n Strong enough to carry him  \n He ain\u2019t heavy, he\u2019s my brother \u201d \u2013 He Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Brother by The Hollies \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/12/11/he-aint-heavy-hes-my-brother/", "title": "\n\t\t\tHe Ain\u2019t Heavy He\u2019s My\u00a0Brother\t\t"},
{"date": "December 15, 2010", "body": "The paperwork has been sitting on my desk for three weeks now.\u00a0 I can\u2019t do it. All those forms that I need to complete if I want to get Lewis evaluated by the team at the Center for Children with Special Needs\u2026they are still blank.\u00a0\u00a0 I can\u2019t fill them out. I started to \u2013 I really did.\u00a0 When we got home from the appointment with Howie\u2019s developmental pediatrician (remember her?\u00a0 she called me \u201c Super Mom \u201c?), I sat down at my desk with the stack of forms she gave me.\u00a0 It was the quickest way to get in to see the speech/language pathologist, she told me, since we were still concerned about his speech delay.\u00a0 And it couldn\u2019t hurt to have a full evaluation, could it? So there I sat that afternoon, pen in hand, ready to answer all those questions again, just like I did a year ago for Howie. But then my eyes glanced down to the bottom of the page.\u00a0 \u201cPlease include a picture of your child here.\u201d I stopped.\u00a0 I put the pen down.\u00a0 And blinking back tears, I walked away. That was three weeks ago.\u00a0 Right now, those forms are staring at me as I type (ok, they are actually under a pile of  blue paper snowflakes , but they can still see me and I can see them\u2026) I can\u2019t fill them out because I don\u2019t see  it  with Lewis. I\u2019m going to try to explain what  it  is. Here\u2019s what I don\u2019t see: I don\u2019t see the long, protracted meltdowns that seem to go on forever.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see the impulsive behaviors and the inability to control them.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see the feeding issues, the sleep issues, or the motor planning issues.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see a child uncomfortable in his own skin.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see a child desperately trying to interpret the world around him. Here\u2019s what I do see:\u00a0 I see empathy.\u00a0 I see pretend play.\u00a0 I see a child who can feed himself, undress himself, and sleep through the night unassisted.\u00a0 I see the ability to hold a crayon and do a puzzle and transition from one activity to the next without a tantrum. It was the complete reverse with Howie.\u00a0 All the things I see with Lewis, we didn\u2019t see with Howie.\u00a0 And all the things we worried about with Howie, we don\u2019t with Lewis. That\u2019s the  it,  I guess.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see the autism. And that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t put his face on that form.\u00a0 Because I\u2019m not sure it belongs there. This is not to say that I\u2019m not seeing things that worry me. I still see a child who understands everything but still has a very hard  time expressing himself and that gap concerns me.\u00a0 Lewis is very shy and won\u2019t talk at all  to anyone he doesn\u2019t know. There are some sensory issues too \u2013 he has a fit if his socks aren\u2019t just right and would be happiest staying in his pajamas or not wearing any clothes at all.\u00a0 This sensory avoidance stuff is very familiar, though.\u00a0 Throw in a hatred of turtlenecks and a fear of touching cotton balls and this kid is\u2026me. So long story short, I don\u2019t know what to do. I do think he needs to see a speech therapist again for another evaluation.\u00a0 We\u2019ve come a long way but I don\u2019t know where we really are in the grand scheme of all-things-speech.\u00a0 If I fill out those forms for the developmental evaluation, we could see someone quickly since this particular clinic takes the youngest kids first.\u00a0 But I can\u2019t get past the fact that in my heart I feel like we\u2019d be wasting all the other doctors\u2019 time \u2013 that we would just be going there to get a faster speech eval.\u00a0 I can\u2019t stand the idea that we might take up an appointment time that we don\u2019t really need.\u00a0 We could use up a spot that could have gone to some other family \u2013 one desperately seeking answers and help.\u00a0 A family like just like ours, only one year ago. But what if I\u2019m completely wrong?\u00a0 What if I\u2019m not seeing  it  because I don\u2019t want to see  it  again? Would I be so quick to give up my spot on the appointment list if this was my first child and not my third? Sigh .\u00a0 Parental guilt.\u00a0 Never ending. I do know one thing.\u00a0 The speech pathologist from Early Intervention will come back in February to test Lewis when he\u2019s 2 1/2 years old.\u00a0 She promised she would.\u00a0 I\u2019ve already called her and left a message to set up an appointment. And for now, I think I\u2019m going to stop there. I\u2019m trusting my gut on this one.\u00a0 If I\u2019m wrong\u2026if I\u2019ve missed something\u2026 I\u2019m keeping all that paperwork on my desk.\u00a0 Just as a reminder that it\u2019s there, waiting for us, if we need it. \u201cSometimes I think I know too much \n \u2019bout what goes on in the real world and such \n Half of me is certain, the other isn\u2019t sure \n One half has the symptom, the other has the cure\u2026 It\u2019s a fine line, a very fine line \n Split decision \n It\u2019s a fine line, a very fine line\u201d  \u2013 Split Decision by Steve Winwood \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/11/22/superman/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/12/11/he-aint-heavy-hes-my-brother/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/12/15/split-decision/", "title": "\n\t\t\tSplit Decision\t\t"},
{"date": "December 27, 2010", "body": "\u201cAt some point traditions change or shift.\u201d This was what my brother told me a few weeks ago through e-mail, when I was whining to him about our inability to do \u201cwhat we used to do\u201d for the holidays.\u00a0 He wrote back: at some point traditions change or shift. New traditions. Sounds a bit like an oxymoron.\u00a0 Like jumbo shrimp or controlled chaos. But in our typically unusual house, that\u2019s exactly what we did this year for the holidays.\u00a0 Create new traditions.\u00a0 Because we had to. December used to be one crazy month.\u00a0 We celebrate both holidays in our family \u2013 starting with Chanukah in our house and with my side of the family.\u00a0 I used to plan parties for family and friends, with dreidel games and bagels and latkes and gifts for everyone.\u00a0 This year, I couldn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 I was emotionally, physically, and financially exhausted. We had to do something different.\u00a0 Luckily, Chanukah was early this year and close enough to Thanksgiving so we were able to celebrate it with my family while we were already in Vermont. The boys lit the candles with my mother and opened their gifts at her house, not caring that we were a few days early. Lighting the candles with my mother When the actual week of  Chanukah  arrived, the boys opened one present each night.\u00a0 While I know that this is the usual tradition for many Jewish families, we\u2019ve always opened all of our presents on the first night.\u00a0 That\u2019s the way my family has always done it since I was a kid.\u00a0 But thanks to Chanukah coming so early and my complete lack of planning, many of the kids\u2019 gifts didn\u2019t arrive in time for the first night.\u00a0 So by default, we opened one gift a night. And it worked. There was no sensory overload from a room full of wrapping paper and empty boxes.\u00a0 There were no gifts left untouched because other gifts seemed cooler at the time.\u00a0 When books were opened on the third night, it was still just as awesome as the monster trucks opened on the last night.\u00a0 And now\u2026a new tradition in our house. Mercifully, there were three weeks between Chanukah and Christmas this year.\u00a0 When Gerry and Howie were small, we used to travel to my mother-in-law\u2019s house to have Christmas there.\u00a0 She\u2019d save the decorating until that morning, and the boys would help her put the ornaments on the tree.\u00a0 We\u2019d spend the day there, opening gifts and having Christmas lunch. When Howie was two, his sensory issues were becoming more difficult, and we knew he just couldn\u2019t manage a whole day of present opening overload in unfamiliar surroundings.\u00a0 Lewis was just an infant at Christmastime that year, and I wasn\u2019t keen on taking him out anywhere.\u00a0 Tim\u2019s family graciously moved their holiday celebration to our house, tree and all. The tradition has evolved now to something the kids look forward to.\u00a0 My mother-in-law brought the tree, ornaments and presents to the house, the kids took 30 minutes to decorate it, and then they opened their presents.\u00a0 A few hours later, we packed up the tree and ornaments and Christmas was over. No Christmas lunch, no unfamiliar surroundings. And again, it worked. Very fond of the Thomas the Tank Engine ornament There were points where it could have gone awry.\u00a0 I had prepped Howie an hour before my mother-in-law arrived \u2013 telling him exactly how the afternoon was going to go and reminded him that the tree wasn\u2019t staying.\u00a0 When he started to get upset, I brought him back to our conversation and he was able to calm himself down before a meltdown occurred.\u00a0 And we didn\u2019t even bother trying to have a Christmas lunch or sit down dinner that night.\u00a0 Even though I bought a ham, only Lewis and I ate it (smothered in maple syrup because I\u2019m a Vermonter at heart).\u00a0 Tim had cold sesame noodles, Gerry had waffles, and Howie sat in his favorite green chair in the TV room with some goldfish.\u00a0 It was all he could attempt at that point of the night, and I wasn\u2019t going to bother trying anything else. I found that changing traditions was a little like changing my kids\u2019 routines.\u00a0 I had to give advance notice and any shift without planning had the potential for trouble.\u00a0 When I forgot to buy gingerbread houses this year, Gerry got upset because it was something we \u201calways did\u201d over winter break.\u00a0 So out I went to find corn-free, dye free gingerbread houses and decorating candy so Howie could eat it all.\u00a0 It was important to him and consequently, to me.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been eating gingerbread all week now. Very proud of their gingerbread houses New traditions.\u00a0 Focused on the idea of family and the holiday, and not around something that we think we have to be doing, just because we\u2019ve always done it that way.\u00a0 Not canceling them, but making a change to fit how our family works now. I think I kind of like it this way. \u201c Tradition, tradition! Tradition! \n  Tradition, tradition!

{"date": "November 22, 2010", "body": "Dear Dr. D- I could just hug you. If you knew me better, you\u2019d know that hugging isn\u2019t my thing.\u00a0 But leaving your office today after our first follow up visit since Howie\u2019s diagnosis, I felt like I could fly. Why? Because you called me \u201cSuper Mom\u201d. It\u2019s clear I fooled you, but it doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 You said it and you can\u2019t take it back. You called me \u201cSuper Mom\u201d. You were impressed by how far we\u2019ve come in just a year.\u00a0 You told me Howie\u2019s IEP was one of the most comprehensive IEP\u2019s you\u2019d seen in a while.\u00a0 When we talked about all the supports and services he was receiving, you were excited because you could tell it was helping. You told me I clearly had a great team put together.\u00a0 Your eyes widened when you saw Howie write his name \u2013 not just because it was legible, but because his grip on the crayon was so much better.\u00a0 We talked about his OT supports and the fact that we\u2019ve worked sensory breaks into his daily log sheet.\u00a0 You asked about speech, and when I told you he didn\u2019t qualify for direct services you weren\u2019t surprised, but reminded me to keep an eye on his pragmatics.\u00a0 I told you his one-on-one aide is always with him to help facilitate social interactions in the classroom, and at playdates at home I\u2019m there to help.\u00a0 I said he was starting to pretend play, and interact better with peers.\u00a0 I told you it was getting easier.\u00a0 You said you could tell. And that\u2019s when you called me \u201cSuper Mom\u201d. You told me to push for a social speech group for him.\u00a0 Maybe not in preschool, but definitely for kindergarten next year. When you asked about home supports, you were clearly asking to see if I was getting help myself.\u00a0 I told you that we used our home services during the spring, but this fall I have kind of let it slide.\u00a0 I said I just didn\u2019t know how to translate our home issues into a concrete problem to be solved.\u00a0 When you suggested that the teacher just come in and simply observe \u2013 Supernanny style \u2013 it made sense.\u00a0 You said it might be something as simple as listening to our interactions, and tweaking our language.\u00a0 Even in our small amount of time together, you heard me  ask  Howie to do things, instead of  telling  him it was time to do things.\u00a0 You reminded me that if he doesn\u2019t have a choice in the situation, don\u2019t give him one.\u00a0 It creates a climate for non-compliance. I didn\u2019t even know I was doing it. I said the hardest thing at home right now were sibling issues.\u00a0 It was difficult keeping Gerry from getting frustrated and angry when Howie can\u2019t control his behaviors.\u00a0 I said that with Lewis I couldn\u2019t tell what were actual behavior issues, or just mimicking Howie\u2019s stimming.\u00a0 And I shared that it was getting harder to help Lewis understand the difference between right and wrong, because with every wrong choice, Howie is there laughing and egging him on.\u00a0 You reminded me that this is exactly what the home services are for. Then, seemingly from left field, you asked me more about Lewis.\u00a0 Nonchalantly, like it was part of the conversation.\u00a0 I forgot that you didn\u2019t know about all the EI testing we\u2019ve been through, so I quickly filled you in.\u00a0 Long story short, he has  speech delays  but didn\u2019t qualify for services, but we weren\u2019t really concerned about any other areas.\u00a0 You took it all in, and suggested we do a full developmental assessment anyway through your 0-3 clinic, just to make sure.\u00a0 The only reason not to, you said, was to keep from raising my anxiety level.\u00a0 We laughed together when I said that it was too late.\u00a0 I realized later you were concerned about the  younger sibling link  to increased risk of spectrum disorders.\u00a0 You care.\u00a0 And I\u2019m so grateful. Your next steps were clear and concise.\u00a0 In a year or two, we\u2019ll talk about neuropsych evaluations, but you didn\u2019t see it necessary now.\u00a0 You also mentioned we should start looking into  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  methods, because high functioning kids like Howie respond really well to that around age six or seven.\u00a0 You thought he was too young now at age four, but we should keep it on the back of our minds. I mentioned that our annual IEP review meeting was coming up in January.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t let them change a thing\u201d, you said. Finally, I asked the big question.\u00a0 Considering all the progress we\u2019ve made in such a short period of time, considering where we are now\u2026was he misdiagnosed? No.\u00a0 You were clear.\u00a0 Howie meets the criteria for high functioning autism.\u00a0 His successes, you said, were because of the excellent services we\u2019ve received.\u00a0 And again, you told me \u201cdon\u2019t let them change a thing.\u201d I won\u2019t.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never been so happy to keep the status quo. You called me \u201cSuper Mom\u201d.\u00a0 And after this appointment, I feel like I could save the world. \u201c I am I am I am Superman and I know what\u2019s happening. \n I am I am I am Superman and I can do anything.\u201d  \u2013 Superman by REM \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/09/23/i-may-know-the-word/", "http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/10/13/got-questions-answers-to-your-questions-from-the-autism-speaks%E2%80%99-science-staff/", "http://www.nacbt.org/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/11/22/superman/", "title": "\n\t\t\tSuperman\t\t"},
{"date": "November 24, 2010", "body": "Every year at Thanksgiving, we go around the table at my mother\u2019s house and say what we are grateful for. My usual answer is, of course, my family.\u00a0 This year is no exception. Except this time,\u00a0 my family has expanded quite a bit.\u00a0 It hasn\u2019t been an easy year.\u00a0 But in the 11 months since my son\u2019s autism diagnosis my family has grown to include this wonderful and welcoming community of fellow parents with children on the spectrum.\u00a0 I truly feel like they are all part of my inner circle now, because without them to lean on, I\u2019m not sure I would have made it. So forgive me if I forget a few names in this list \u2013 know that if you are out there and I\u2019ve \u201cmet\u201d you, you\u2019ve helped me. This year, I am thankful for: \u2013 My friends from  Spectrummy Mummy ,  Welcome to the Mad House , and  I Should Have Called Him Calvin , who dropped everything when I was having a crisis of confidence to help me through it via e-mail exchanges, even in different time zones across the globe; \u2013 My SibShop mom friends, who have shown me a path to being a better mother through their grace and humor and tireless dedication to our amazing community (I won\u2019t \u201cout\u201d you here but you know who you are); \u2013 The  three moms  who welcomed me immediately at my son\u2019s school after his diagnosis, and who instantly invited me for playdates without hesitation; \u2013 My  support group , who without even knowing it have changed my life; \u2013 My fellow writers  Hartley ,  Caitlin ,  Patty  and  Michelle , whose amazing talents have pushed me to be a better writer; \u2013 The writers in the  SPD Blogger Network , who were the first people online to show me that I wasn\u2019t alone; \u2013\u00a0 The high school and college friends that I have \u201crediscovered\u201d here through this blog, who have encouraged me to write my story and who have been brave enough to share their parenting struggles with me; \u2013 The moms of my kids\u2019 best friends, who have become my best friends as well; \u2013 My friend N., who while constantly crushing me at Facebook Scrabble still manages to make coffee squirt out of my nose with her hysterical instant messages; and \u2013 The unbelievably honest and warm community of parent bloggers that I have grown to love and trust.\u00a0 There are too many to mention, but click on any name on any of the comments on any post in this blog and you\u2019ll meet an amazing person doing heroic things every day. Of course, I am also eternally thankful for my actual family this year too.\u00a0 My extended family of aunts, uncles and cousins chose the path less traveled by opening their arms and hearts to us to embrace our family, when they could have very easily turned away.\u00a0 My brother and sister-in-law have continued to be beyond supportive and helpful, even from across the country.\u00a0 My sister, of whom I am so proud, has asked me for a blue puzzle piece on her coat this winter.\u00a0 My mom, a special educator herself, has gone above and beyond what is expected of a grandmother.\u00a0 And she gets a huge thank you for staying with Tim and the boys when I went to see the  Glee tour in New York City. And just like every year, I am most grateful for my boys and for my husband  Tim .\u00a0 Every day they make me thankful that I am a part of this family.

When I was a kid, I didn\u2019t like sharing the fact that we were Jewish.\u00a0 In the small town where I grew up, we were one of three Jewish families.\u00a0 Being Jewish made me feel different.\u00a0 It made me stand out.\u00a0 My friends would ask me what I got for Christmas and I\u2019d say nothing.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t have a tree like everyone else in town, we didn\u2019t go to church on Christmas Eve, and we didn\u2019t wait for Santa by the chimney.\u00a0 Each year I would beg for a tree or for a present from Santa, and once in a while my parents would give in.\u00a0 But they would also remind me to be proud of my ancestry and the traditions we have as a family, so every year they would go into our elementary school armed with dreidels and books to teach the kids about our holiday, and why it\u2019s special. It reminds me a lot of our life with our son. Yes, having a child with autism spectrum disorder makes us different.\u00a0 Our family isn\u2019t the same as the one next door or down the block.\u00a0 We have different challenges than other families do, and we have to parent accordingly.\u00a0 Yes, it may make us stand out in town.\u00a0 But we can\u2019t be ashamed of it.\u00a0 It\u2019s our family and it\u2019s what makes our family, and our son, special.\u00a0 And just like my parents did with the children in my elementary school, it\u2019s my job as his parent to educate those around us about his differences.\u00a0 Like Temple Grandin\u2019s mother said \u201cDifferent, not less\u201d.

{"date": "November 29, 2010", "body": "My brother says I have mild anticipatory anxiety. It\u2019s ok, he\u2019s a psychologist so he\u2019s allowed to say that.\u00a0 Mostly because it\u2019s true. I found many random websites with definitions of anticipatory anxiety, but the most straightforward one was this  one  :  anxiety that one experiences before starting a challenging activity.\u00a0 Most often, anticipatory anxiety is a lot higher than what you actually end up experiencing. I\u2019m sure my brother has a better definition, but this one sums it up for me perfectly. I was definitely in high anxiety mode before our Thanksgiving trip last Thursday.\u00a0 I usually starting panicking about two days before the trip as I start to plan to pack (note I didn\u2019t say actually start packing, because I can\u2019t seem to get to that point until the night before we leave).\u00a0 I start making lists of how many shirts for each person, mapping out our route and departure time, and I start shopping for all the food we\u2019ll need for the trip. Now remember, it\u2019s only a 250 mile trip to my mother\u2019s house.\u00a0 And we\u2019re only going to be gone two days. But in my head I start working through what I need to do to make the trip successful \u2013 there and back.\u00a0 Extra clothes.\u00a0 Snacks.\u00a0 DVDs, books, games.\u00a0 Heck, I even wrote a  post  about everything we have to bring with us. I\u2019m not sure why I get this way.\u00a0 Well, actually I do.\u00a0 Over the past two years I\u2019ve become quite a control freak.\u00a0 I know it\u2019s all tied to my son\u2019s sensory issues and his spectrum diagnosis.\u00a0 In our house, I can attempt to control how he behaves and I have all my \u201ctools\u201d at my disposal.\u00a0 Timers, schedules, sensory breaks, quiet time for Lewis\u2019 nap \u2013 I can do all that in the house.\u00a0 In the car with all five of us, it gets harder to manage. Plus, I have past experiences to pull from.\u00a0 On one car ride, Howie asked for a hug for one hour straight.\u00a0 On another, his car seat was uncomfortable so he yelled for a good portion of the trip, just as the baby had fallen asleep for his nap.\u00a0 Then Gerry will chime in that Howie\u2019s being too noisy, and a five hour car ride ends up feeling like ten.\u00a0 Or more. Add in that we were traveling for Thanksgiving \u2013 my favorite holiday but not the easiest one for the rest of my family.\u00a0 I\u2019m the only turkey/gravy/sweet potato eater of the bunch.\u00a0 Past Thanksgivings, I\u2019ve spent the whole time either convincing my kids to try the turkey or chasing them out from under the table after 5 minutes of sitting.\u00a0 My vegan husband would eat the rolls and carrots. For the last eight years, my favorite meal of the year was inhaled in 3 minutes so I could retreat to another room with my kids. So yes, I was panicking about this trip.\u00a0 All parts of it.\u00a0 In my head I got so worked up about the trip that I thought we shouldn\u2019t go.\u00a0 Or couldn\u2019t go.\u00a0 My anticipatory anxiety was leading me to think we should just cancel the whole thing and stay at home.\u00a0 In other words, go back to the definition above. But I couldn\u2019t listen to it.\u00a0 This time, I was determined to make things different.\u00a0 So we made some minor adjustments to our travel plan. Instead of our usual departure day on Wednesday, we decided to drive up on Thanksgiving morning.\u00a0 The weather was perfect and the roads were empty.\u00a0 There was no eight mile backup on the Massachusetts Turnpike like the day before.\u00a0 And because we left on Thanksgiving when nothing would be open for lunch, I packed us each a picnic for the car ride instead of our usual hour long stop along the way.\u00a0 We had a total of three bathroom breaks and one 15 minute stop to eat our lunch in a parking lot.\u00a0 What was usually a five and a half hour car trip ended up being four and a half.\u00a0 Perfect. I did have a few moments of panic on the way there.\u00a0 Howie\u2019s headphones didn\u2019t fit just right and he got frustrated immediately.\u00a0 Thanks for some maneuvering, I got them to sit properly on his head so he could listen to \u201cSoak Up The Sun\u201d\u00a0 by Sheryl Crow 30 times in a row.\u00a0 I was afraid that Lewis wouldn\u2019t nap on the ride because he woke up\u00a0 later than usual that morning, but he slept for an hour.\u00a0 And because of some advance planning with a new DVD and a organic lollipop, Howie stayed quiet long enough for Lewis to sleep.\u00a0 Gerry had a pile of Star Wars books to read for the ride, so we didn\u2019t hear from him at all.\u00a0 We arrived at my mother\u2019s house around 2pm, just in time to unpack and get ready for dinner. As we sat down for \u201cfeastThanksgiving\u201d (as Howie called it), that anxiety set in again.\u00a0 But there were fewer guests at dinner this year (13 instead of the usual 30) so that helped with the noise level in the room.\u00a0 We had turkey from Panera Bread for the kids to eat, since it\u2019s the only turkey Howie likes.\u00a0 My mom\u2019s friends are vegetarians, so they made several vegan dishes that Tim could eat.\u00a0\u00a0 And suddenly\u2026we were all sitting down quietly and eating. Let me say that again.\u00a0 ALL FIVE OF US WERE QUIETLY EATING.\u00a0 For more than 5 minutes.\u00a0 And I enjoyed not one, but two helpings of stuffing, turkey and sweet potatoes.\u00a0 And it was all hot. Howie said it was the \u201cbest feastThanksgiving ever!\u201d.\u00a0 Tim said it was the most he had ever eaten\u2026ever. Our ride home on Saturday was the same as our ride up \u2013 no traffic, no long lunch stops, no meltdowns.\u00a0 Just a regular road trip.\u00a0 Dare I say, a \u201ctypical\u201d family road trip? Clearly, my anticipatory anxiety worked to my advantage this time.\u00a0 By panicking ahead of time about all the things that could go wrong, I worked out a plan to make sure things would go right.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure that my brother would agree that this is the best treatment plan for my anxiety issues, but when you\u2019re not paying for the therapy you go with what you got. Maybe next year, my anxiety level won\u2019t be so high.\u00a0 But if it is, I\u2019ll be calling my brother for more free advice. \u201c We can never know about the days to come \n But we think about them anyway \n And I wonder if I\u2019m really with you now \n Or just chasing after some finer day. \n Anticipation, Anticipation \n Is making me late \n Is keeping me waiting \u201d \u2013 Anticipation by Carly Simon \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.paniccure.com/Overcoming_Agoraphobia/Anticipatory.htm", "http://www.hartleysboys.com/2010/11/813-mile-car-trip-by-alysia.html"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/anticipation/", "title": "\n\t\t\tAnticipation\t\t"},

{"date": "November 8, 2010", "body": "We had our first snow of the season this morning. When the kids saw it out the window they were beyond excited.\u00a0 I went out to warm up the car and brought in a giant snowball so they could all touch it. That started the mad dash around the house for the winter stuff.\u00a0 Luckily I\u2019m disorganized enough that most of our winter coats, boots, hats and gloves were still out from last winter, so they were easy to find.\u00a0 However, being that disorganized also means that I have no idea what fits anymore. Howie was clamoring to go outside and play in the snow.\u00a0 Maybe clamoring isn\u2019t the right word.\u00a0 Demanding?\u00a0 Insisting?\u00a0 Perseverating? It was 8:30am and I realized that Howie wasn\u2019t dressed yet for school.\u00a0 We need to be out the door by 8:35 to get to school on time.\u00a0 I pulled him away from the window to help him get dressed. To distract him, I asked if he wanted to wear his boots to school today. He ran away from me and started jumping up and down.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHug!\u00a0 Hug!\u00a0 Hug!\u00a0 Hug!\u201d I grabbed him back and wrestled with his pajamas. I asked again if he wanted to wear his boots. \u201cNo! No! No!\u00a0 Hug! Hug! Hug!\u201d \u201cNo hug until you get dressed and answer me!\u201d More jumping.\u00a0 \u201cHug!\u00a0 Hug!\u00a0 Hug!\u201d \u201cYou need to look at me and answer me first!\u00a0 Do you want to wear your boots!\u201d And did I mention that while this was going on, Lewis would come over and gently tap me on the back with a Wii Remote and fall to the floor and roll around?\u00a0 I\u2019m sure he\u2019s imitating some move in a game that Gerry plays, I\u2019m just not sure which one. Autism Mom was on one shoulder, gently reminding me that we would get nowhere until he got his hug.\u00a0 Running Late Mom was on the other shoulder, already at the end of her rope at 8:32am on a Monday. At 8:33am, Autism Mom kicked Running Late Mom off her shoulder.\u00a0 I pulled Howie in for a hug. \u201cI would like to wear my boots and make footprints in the snow around the tree.\u201d I gathered up Lewis in his winter coat and gave Howie his boots, praying they would still fit.\u00a0 They did, of course.\u00a0 As did his coat and gloves and every other winter item from last year. We headed outside to the car. At this point it\u2019s pouring rain (this is New England \u2013 don\u2019t like the weather?\u00a0 Wait five minutes).\u00a0 As I put Lewis into his car seat, Howie ran around the front yard making footprints in the quickly melting snow.\u00a0 It was a scene right out of \u201cThe Snowy Day\u201d by Ezra Jack Keats.\u00a0 He was getting completely soaked but he didn\u2019t care.\u00a0 I joined him for a minute and we compared footprints.\u00a0 His smile returned and he climbed into the car without complaint. At school, we made footprints together as we raced towards the door.\u00a0 I handed him over to his one-on-one aide and reminded her that his sneakers were in his backpack.\u00a0 Howie started to run for more snow, but she caught him at the door.\u00a0 That motion made him slide in the snow, causing his footprints to make a giant swoosh in the now slush by the school stairs.\u00a0 This giant laugh came out of him \u2013 the laugh that tells me he\u2019s going to be ok.\u00a0 I ran back to the car through the rain to get Lewis home.\u00a0 I could still hear him laughing. When getting Lewis out of the car, I handed him the one pound bag of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts coffee I had bought the day before.\u00a0 He carried it in, and wouldn\u2019t let it go.\u00a0 I turned around for a moment to get my coffee cup ready, and he had climbed up into his high chair.\u00a0 This is usually his signal that he wants something to eat. Following the advice of the speech therapist, I looked him right in the eye and asked him what he wanted. He pointed to the bag of coffee. And for the first time, a spontaneous two word sentence response to a question: \u201cSum No-Nut?\u201d Maybe this Monday won\u2019t be so bad after all. \u201cTalking to myself and feeling old \n Sometimes I\u2019d like to quit \n Nothing ever seems to fit \n Hangin around, nothing to do but frown \n Rainy days and Mondays always get me down\u201d  \u2013 Rainy Days & Mondays by The Carpenters \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/11/08/rainy-days-and-mondays/", "title": "\n\t\t\tRainy Days and\u00a0Mondays\t\t"},

{"date": "November 15, 2010", "body": "\u201cWhat is your escape?\u00a0 What is the one thing that you do that makes you feel like you?\u201d The question loomed over me all month long.\u00a0 It was the discussion topic for our support group meeting.\u00a0 In order to learn a little bit more about each other as people (and not just mothers of kids with special needs) we decided we\u2019d share our \u201cescapes\u201d.\u00a0 The hope was that it would get us all talking about the positives in our lives, and maybe discover that we had some escapes in common. So all month I thought about it.\u00a0 What was my escape? ( side note: I got permission from the women who were there to share this.\u00a0 That support group is my safe haven to share things, and we expect that whatever we talk about there, stays in the room.\u00a0 It\u2019s our Vegas, baby.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll protect that confidentiality to the end.) As we went around the room, the clear winner in the escape category was working, followed by exercising. Then it was my turn.\u00a0 What was  my  escape? I had none. \u201cYou blog?\u201d, my friend suggested. Frankly, this was going to be my original response.\u00a0 It is what I do when I have time to myself and I love writing. It is something that is all mine.\u00a0 But as I listened to the other women there, I realized it wasn\u2019t really an escape.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t take me away from everything else going on here, in fact in many ways it amplifies it.\u00a0 I\u2019m not \u201cjust me\u201d when I\u2019m writing.\u00a0 I\u2019m still my kids\u2019 mom. Blogging is sometimes more like free therapy for me.\u00a0 So all the words and feelings don\u2019t explode out of my head and land on the kids or my husband. For my friends, work and exercising made them feel like they were accomplishing something.\u00a0 Setting goals and achieving them.\u00a0 An expert in something, the \u201cgo-to\u201d person when things went wrong.\u00a0 A time when their brains were switched from \u201cmom\u201d mode.\u00a0 I remember that.\u00a0 I used to run an office, manage payroll, plan the schedules for over 20 teachers and still teach at night myself.\u00a0 Now I\u2019m the mom who drops her kids off at school in her pajamas and forgets to pack lunches and snacks. I left that night on a search for my escape. I tried to think what it could be.\u00a0 Maybe it was running?\u00a0 This summer I ran in preparation for  my first 5K race .\u00a0 It did get me out of the house alone \u2013 just me and my iPod.\u00a0 But it still didn\u2019t feel like an escape to me. In order for me to actually get out to run, many planets had to align.\u00a0 My husband had to be home to be with the kids.\u00a0 I needed to have had a decent night sleep.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t go when meltdowns were happening around me.\u00a0 My running time depended on someone else\u2019s schedule. In my head, an escape had to be something that happened on MY time.\u00a0 Not when I felt like everyone else\u2019s needs were taken care of. I went through it all in my head.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like to cook.\u00a0 I\u2019m not crafty.\u00a0 I can\u2019t sew.\u00a0 Watching Martha Stewart for more than 5 minutes makes me itchy. I have tossed around the idea of doing some part time work from home, but the last two times I had that thought I ended up pregnant again.\u00a0 So you can imagine I\u2019m a bit gun shy at the idea. Before kids, we did all sorts of things to escape.\u00a0 Tim and I would spend the weekend camping at the marina and go out on the boat all day.\u00a0 We\u2019d sit at Barnes & Noble and have coffee and read the Sunday paper.\u00a0 We\u2019d sit on the couch and do crossword puzzles together. Even after Gerry was born I still found some time to escape.\u00a0 He was in daycare three mornings a week, and I would go to Jazzercise or take a walk with the dog, or even grocery shop alone.\u00a0 Howie went to daycare two mornings a week the summer before Lewis was born, and I used that time to get ready for the new baby.\u00a0 It was my quiet time to plan as I pleased. I need my escape to be when everyone else is engaged in their own thing as well. With that, I realized that my escape time will be coming.\u00a0 Next September, Lewis will be in preschool two mornings a week, and the other boys will be in school full time.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have five hours each week that will be mine again. So I have 10 months to find my escape.\u00a0 Maybe it will be something I\u2019ve done in the past.\u00a0 Maybe it will be something new.\u00a0 I\u2019m open to suggestions.\u00a0 It\u2019s ok that right now I don\u2019t have that escape.\u00a0 I know it will come.\u00a0 I\u2019m looking forward to discovering what that one thing will be for me, something that helps me flip the switch to \u201cAlysia\u201d mode. In the meantime, I know that in my own house I am the expert.\u00a0 I am that \u201cgo-to\u201d person when things go wrong.\u00a0 I\u2019m the one setting the goals and it\u2019s my job to help my family reach them.\u00a0 And it\u2019s ok if, for now, I leave the switch in \u201cmom\u201d mode. Especially since I can do that in my pajamas. \u201cI said, \u2018I never knew\u2019\u2026 \n  That you liked Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain. \n  And the feel of the ocean, and the taste of champagne. \n  If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape.  \n  You\u2019re the love that I\u2019ve looked for, come with me, and escape.\u201d  \u2013 Escape (The Pina Colada Song) by Rupert Holmes \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2010/10/16/run-baby-run.html"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/escape/", "title": "\n\t\t\tEscape\t\t"},

But the kids wouldn\u2019t let me. Well, really, life wouldn\u2019t let me.

{"date": "November 20, 2010", "body": "On Thursday, I made my triumphant return to storytime at the library. There was no parade, no confetti, no shouts of \u201cYou Go Girl!!\u201d.\u00a0 But there should have been. It was the first activity that Lewis and I had ever done together.\u00a0 Yes, we\u2019ve been to the supermarket, Target, and many other shopping adventures.\u00a0 But never an actual \u201cactivity\u201d.\u00a0 Never something just for him.\u00a0 And for me. It wasn\u2019t always like this.\u00a0 When Gerry was a baby, we did everything.\u00a0\u00a0 We did all those gymnastics classes, music classes, and puppet shows.\u00a0 I\u2019d take him to the park to play and we\u2019d stay all morning.\u00a0 And we went to story time at our local library before he was old enough to walk.\u00a0 Gerry would stay close to me, right in my lap, and while the other kids got up to explore, he always stayed put until the librarian was finished.\u00a0 We\u2019d spend hours at the library, sitting at the table, reading books, choosing our favorites and taking them home. When Howie was a baby, we tried all those things again.\u00a0 Before Howie was old enough for his own story time, I\u2019d try to take Gerry to different activities at the library so he wasn\u2019t missing out.\u00a0 We had just moved to town and I thought it was a good way to meet other kids and parents.\u00a0 Inevitably, I\u2019d spend the whole time in the hallway with Howie.\u00a0 He was either screaming, crying, or running away.\u00a0 Following close behind would be Gerry, because he didn\u2019t want to be in there alone.\u00a0 After several attempts, we just stopped going.\u00a0 I tried a few times when Howie was older (with baby Lewis in tow) and he still couldn\u2019t sit there\u2026for anything.\u00a0 It was embarrassing.\u00a0 I felt like the only one there chasing after her kid, covering his ears so the music wasn\u2019t so loud or pulling him away from the crayons because it wasn\u2019t craft time yet.\u00a0 So after getting yelled at by the librarian for signing up for events and not showing up, we stopped even trying. When Lewis was finally old enough for his own story time, I was a bit reluctant.\u00a0 Ok, VERY reluctant.\u00a0 Once bitten, twice shy.\u00a0 I thought it was better for us to just do our own thing.\u00a0 I can read to him.\u00a0 I can color with him.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to go through the same embarrassment again. But both my pediatrician and speech therapist told me Lewis needed be around kids his own age.\u00a0 He needed to hear other 2 year olds talking and he needed to learn how to play and interact with them.\u00a0 My friend has a 2 1/2 yr old, so we started searching around for activities that we could try \u2013 gymnastics, music classes \u2013 to get ourselves back out there.\u00a0 I turned them all down.\u00a0 It cost too much, it was 25 minutes away, the time of day was bad.\u00a0 But really, I was just too afraid. Then, the flyer for story time at the library came home.\u00a0 A time just for 18 month olds \u2013 3 yr olds.\u00a0 Free.\u00a0 Five minutes away. 10:45am. It was like the library wrote the flyer just for us.\u00a0 So my friend and I signed up.\u00a0 Thursday was the first class. I\u2019d like to say it all went smoothly.\u00a0 That Lewis sat in my lap and listened to the story and danced to the music and did the craft.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t.\u00a0 The crayons were out when we first got there and all he wanted to do was color.\u00a0 Of course, that was last on the agenda, and I had to keep pulling him away from the craft table.\u00a0 He stood on my lap during the first story, left the room during the second one, and refused to give up his bean bag during the \u201cpass the bean bag\u201d game. But you know what?\u00a0 I didn\u2019t care. This time, I didn\u2019t care what the librarian or the other parents thought.\u00a0 We did our best to conform with the story time flow, but if we couldn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t.\u00a0 When he screamed because he couldn\u2019t color, I gave him his pacifier.\u00a0 When he couldn\u2019t sit, I let him stand, and when he couldn\u2019t stand anymore, we left the room until he could come back again.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t force him to give up his bean bag for the game.\u00a0 And looking around at the other kids?\u00a0 They weren\u2019t playing by the \u201crules\u201d either. When it was time to color, Lewis sat very nicely at the table.\u00a0 He picked out the green crayon to match his shirt, and colored his little cut out person with scribbles and dots.\u00a0 And when he was done, we were done.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t wait for some goodbye cue from the librarian.\u00a0 I followed my own kid\u2019s cues.\u00a0 We left the library with my friend and her son.\u00a0 No meltdowns.\u00a0 No tantrums.\u00a0 No screaming and yelling.\u00a0 Lewis held my hand as we walked down the path to our car and we went home.\u00a0 Just like that. To say that my kids are different would be ridiculous and obvious.\u00a0 Of course they are different \u2013 every kid is.\u00a0 They have different strengths and challenges.\u00a0 Howie is very articulate, yet struggles with sensory overload, auditory processing and behavior control.\u00a0 Lewis is the opposite.\u00a0 Certain activities will work for one child and won\u2019t work for another.\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing wrong or shameful about that. What I have to remember is that I am different now too.\u00a0 I am a different parent than I was four years ago or even two years ago.\u00a0 I understand my kids\u2019 limits better and when it\u2019s ok to push them and when it\u2019s ok to pull back.\u00a0 I am more focused on their needs and not conforming to what the librarian wants or thinks.\u00a0 I attempt to work with in the parameters of the activity, and if my kids can\u2019t do it, we leave and return when and if we can.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to make the experience miserable for my child, the librarian or the other families in the room. No more embarrassment, no more shame.\u00a0 It\u2019s not worth it.\u00a0 Because the alternative is to never leave the house.\u00a0 That can\u2019t be an option. So when the next Thursday story time comes around, we\u2019ll be there again.\u00a0 I\u2019m actually looking forward to it this time. \u201c You remind me I live in a shell \n safe from the past, and doing\u2019 okay \n but not very well \n No jolts, no surprises \n No crisis arises \n My life goes along as it should \n It\u2019s all very nice but not very good \n And I\u2019m ready to take  \n a chance again \u201d \u2013 Ready to Take a Chance Again by Barry Manilow \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/11/20/ready-to-take-a-chance-again/", "title": "\n\t\t\tReady To Take A Chance\u00a0Again\t\t"},
{"date": "October 27, 2010", "body": "I\u2019ve been finding that lately I\u2019ve been in a bit of a funk. I seemed to be mired in all things autism lately.\u00a0 So much of what I read and write is about my son and his issues caused by his autism, and how it affects him and our family.\u00a0 There are some days that it feels like it\u2019s all I talk about or read.\u00a0 Many of blogs I read are autism-related, and 90% of the people I follow on Twitter are involved in some aspect of autism education or awareness (the other 10% are the cast members of Glee).\u00a0 It\u2019s not surprising that this is my focus, considering this is my life 24 hours a day, and I learn a tremendous amount from all the information I read. Sometimes, though, I need a break.\u00a0 And I\u2019m guessing that people reading this might need one too.\u00a0 Sometimes I just need to pull myself out of that world and into another one, even if for a moment. So I decided that I would start a series of posts here called \u201cThe B Sides\u201d.\u00a0 I may be dating myself here, but \u201cB Sides\u201d were the flip side of record singles when they were released on 45s.\u00a0 They were usually the songs that the artists were attached to, but the record companies didn\u2019t think were as radio friendly as the A side.\u00a0 Famous B sides include \u201cRuby Tuesday\u201d by The Rolling Stones and \u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d by Bill Haley and His Comets. My B Sides are going to be stories about my favorite memories, ones that have had a lasting impact on my life.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to try to write a \u201cB Side\u201d at least once a month.\u00a0 It may be more if I need it. So for my first B Side: Squirrels In My Pants. It\u2019s 1994 and my family is at the Grand Canyon.\u00a0 My sister, brother and I had never been there before, so while on a family vacation to Las Vegas, we decided to take a side trip to this amazing place.\u00a0 It had been quite a journey to get there, complete with my father sitting in the front of the tiny 8 passenger plane to balance out the weight and my sister vomiting into a sock halfway through the flight. I remember standing near the rail of the canyon with my family along side several other tourists who had been smart enough to take a bus there.\u00a0 There were a few other families walking around, snapping pictures of each other with this unbelievable wonder of the world behind them.\u00a0 And because we were outside there was plenty of wildlife around.\u00a0 In particular, squirrels. As we were all admiring the view from the rim of the canyon, a family near us caught my mother\u2019s eye.\u00a0 She was watching them intently with this worried look on her face.\u00a0 The kids were crouched down on the ground with little bits of food in their hands trying to feed the squirrels.\u00a0 Their parents were watching, laughing and encouraging them. My mom was standing there saying under her breath: \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u00a0 Squirrels Bite\u201d. She was dying to go over there and say something to the parents.\u00a0 The words would have been nicer (because she\u2019s a nice person) but she wanted to tell them something like \u201cHow could you let your kids do that?\u00a0 Are you crazy?\u201d We stopped her. We all convinced her that it wasn\u2019t her place to say anything.\u00a0 The squirrels weren\u2019t really going over to the kids, and it just wasn\u2019t her business to butt in. And of course, we laughed, because while it was just like my mom to want to go over and protect those kids, the only words she could get out were: \u201cBut squirrels bite!\u201d \u201cSquirrels bite\u201d became a catch phrase for our family from that point on, and still is.\u00a0 We use it as a reminder whenever one of us wants to butt in to someone else\u2019s business.\u00a0 And after almost 15 years as a member of our family, my husband says it now too.\u00a0 It\u2019s just part of our language now.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a reminder of one of our last family vacations together, before we became adults and before my dad passed away. Last week, I had a conversation with two friends that reminded me of this memory.\u00a0 Both of these two friends have older kids on the spectrum.\u00a0 We were talking about Howie and one of them asked me when I started to really notice that things were different with him.\u00a0 I went back and forth a bit and I said that even though I knew early on that his sensory stuff was out of whack, I didn\u2019t start to see other things until he was about two.\u00a0 These friends have known Howie since he was little, and they said they saw it, maybe even before I really knew.\u00a0 I asked them why neither of them said anything to me about. They said they didn\u2019t think it was their place to come out and say it.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t know how I would react, and they both saw that I was already doing the things necessary to figure it all out.\u00a0 Independently, they decided that the best thing for them to do was to help guide me and answer my questions, but never come out and say \u201chey \u2013 I think your kid is autistic.\u201d And they are right.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure how I would have reacted at that time to hearing that, even though I probably knew in the back of my head that it was true.\u00a0 It was something that we had to find out for ourselves. Classic \u201csquirrels bite\u201d.\u00a0 They were both dying to say something, wanting to comfort me and let me know I wasn\u2019t alone.\u00a0 But it wasn\u2019t their place to say it.\u00a0 Just like those kids at the Grand Canyon, I had to put the food in my hands and get bit. I find myself in that same situation every now and again.\u00a0 I see a child at the playground or the baseball field and I recognize the behaviors and mannerisms.\u00a0 I see the dark circles under eyes of his parents.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t say anything.\u00a0 It\u2019s not my place. But you might see me on the bench at the playground whispering \u201csquirrels bite\u201d.\u00a0 Because they do, you know.\u00a0 Just ask my mom. (and I know I said I was getting away from all things autism here on The B Sides, but it still seeped in, just like in my real life.\u00a0 I\u2019ll try harder next month. ) \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u201c There are squirrels in my pants! \n  Tell me what\u2019s makin\u2019 you jump like that! \n  S-I-M-P, Squirrels in my pants! \n  Ain\u2019t got no chickens, \n  Ain\u2019t got no rats\u2026 \n  S-I-M-P, \n  Squirrels in my pants !\u201d \u2013 Squirrels In My Pants by Phineas and Ferb \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/squirrels.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/10/27/the-b-side-squirrels-in-my-pants/", "title": "\n\t\t\tThe B Side, Squirrels In My\u00a0Pants\t\t"},
{"date": "September 26, 2010", "body": "Tonight, more thank yous\u2026 First, a huge thank you to all my family and friends who supported us today in our  Walk for Autism Speaks .\u00a0 Our family raised over three times our goal for donations, and our team raised almost six times more than our original goal.\u00a0 Today, my family walked with about 20,000 others \u2013 all affected in someway by autism spectrum disorder.\u00a0 Our team was comprised of all first time walkers.\u00a0 For those of us with kids on the spectrum, this was our first time \u201cgoing public\u201d, so to speak, and certainly the first time asking our friends and family to support a cause like this.\u00a0 I am so proud to have been walking side by side (or in some cases separated by a few thousand people) today with such amazing friends. Speaking of that, I was extremely humbled to have had my cousin and my very good friend walk with us today.\u00a0 Neither one of them have kids on the spectrum, but they were there to support us.\u00a0 I am honored that they chose this event to come to with their husbands and kids and walk with us.\u00a0 A huge thank you from me to them. And now, more thank yous\u2026 Over the past few months that I\u2019ve been writing here, I\u2019ve been blessed to have \u201cmet\u201d some fantastic writers along the way.\u00a0 I\u2019m learning that one of the ways that we bloggers like to support each other is through \u201cawards\u201d, given to each other on our blogs to encourage others to go to our favorite sites.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been lucky enough to receive a few of these awards from some of my favorite sites:  Training Happy Hearts ,  Floortime Lite Mama ,  Life in the House that Asperger Built , and  I Should Have Named Him Calvin .\u00a0 Yes, I\u2019ve been saving them up, partly because I keeping forgetting about it, and partly because I couldn\u2019t figure out how to put in a picture into my post. Both problems solved tonight. So idea behind the Versatile Blogger Award is to write seven things about yourself that others might not know, and then pass the award on to seven other bloggers (kind of a blogging chain letter but without the photocopying and postage stamps).\u00a0 So here goes: 1.\u00a0 I was a Geography major in college, but still have a terrible sense of direction. 2.\u00a0 My husband and I met at work, and I fell in love when he helped me figure out the lyrics to \u201cOnly Want to Be With You\u201d by Hootie and the Blowfish 3. My two favorite Broadway plays are \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d and \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d and I can sing along with every song. 4. One of my biggest regrets in life was quitting piano lessons in 7th grade to play softball. 5.\u00a0 I used to be a politician.\u00a0 Now I just complain about them. 6.\u00a0 The first concert I ever saw was \u201cHuey Lewis and the News\u201d in Lake Placid, NY.\u00a0 A huge thank you to my cousins who went with me because my parents wouldn\u2019t let me go without them. 7. I have yet to get through an episode of NBC\u2019s \u201cParenthood\u201d without getting weepy. Now the next step is to list seven of my favorite blogs so others can check them out.\u00a0 Now, two of my favorites \u201c Welcome to the Madhouse \u201d and \u201c Spectrummy Mummy \u201d have already received the award, so I can\u2019t put them on my list. To honor of the 30th Anniversary of the  SPD Foundation , the first set of blogs are all my friends from my SPD blogger network (in no particular order): Pancakes Gone Awry Special Kid, Special Parent Our Life With SPD Brotherly Love These next three are ones I read every time they post because they are interesting, provocative, and a great way to pass the few quiet minutes I have to myself: Asperger Ninja Partly Sunny, Chance of Rain Autism is Not a Four Letter Word Of course, I have a list a mile wide and I\u2019ve added some blog sites to the giant list of favorites, including my new friends Cheryl, Dawn and Graeme at  The HMEA Blog , the new blog site for our local autism resource center. So thank you for letting me say thank you here, both to my friends and family for the walk today and my cyber friends and family for all that you\u2019ve given to me. \u201c You\u2019ve been so kind and generous, I don\u2019t know how you keep on giving \nFor your kindness I\u2019m in debt to you \nFor your selflessness, my admiration \nFor everything you\u2019ve done, you know I\u2019m bound, I\u2019m bound to \nthank you for it\u2026. \u201d \u2013 Kind and Generous by Natalie Merchant \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.walknowforautismspeaks.org/faf/home/default.asp?ievent=347883&lis=1&kntae347883=958927A5BF0F46B6B814734351099267&login=t", "http://traininghappyhearts.blogspot.com/", "http://drycappucino.blogspot.com/", "http://lifewithasperger.wordpress.com/", "http://ishouldhavecalledhimcalvin.wordpress.com/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/flattery-award.jpg", "http://fiona2107.wordpress.com/", "http://spectrummymummy.wordpress.com/", "http://www.sinetwork.org/celebration2010/index.html", "http://www.pancakesgoneawry.blogspot.com/", "http://specialkidspecialparent.ca/", "http://ourlifewithspd.blogspot.com/", "http://brotherlyloveejkp.wordpress.com/", "http://aspergerninja.blogspot.com/", "http://www.partlysunnyblog.com/", "http://autismisnot.wordpress.com/", "http://hmeablog.com/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/09/26/kind-and-generous/", "title": "\n\t\t\tKind and Generous\t\t"},
{"date": "September 23, 2010", "body": "So first of all, a big thank you. I wrote one line last week about my youngest having his second early intervention appointment.\u00a0  One line .  And I got the most amazing, most overwhelming support from my friends \u2013 both in person and in cyberspace. I got the phone calls I expected that day, the ones from my mom and from my husband.\u00a0 But what I didn\u2019t expect were the e-mails and comments and tweets (yes, I said tweets\u2026sigh) from my friends here in town and across the globe.\u00a0 I can\u2019t express how much that meant to me.\u00a0 It was so different from when I went through it with Howie and I knew only one person who would understand.\u00a0 To have so many others check in with me\u2026I\u2019m speechless.\u00a0 Thank you. So, speaking of speechless\u2026 It\u2019s taken me a week to really be able to process our visit with the speech therapist last week.\u00a0 It was the same woman who evaluated Lewis in  May , so she was very familiar with our situation.\u00a0 We were able to skip over most of the Michigan Early Intervention Developmental Profile and go right to the speech/language portion.\u00a0 She went through the test, trying to get him to use his words to ask for the puzzle pieces, the blocks, the animals\u2026and got nothing.\u00a0 She tried to get him to repeat her words so he\u2019d start talking.\u00a0 She tested him a bit, forcing him to ask for something before giving it to him.\u00a0 Nothing. So since he wouldn\u2019t talk, the therapist and I did instead.\u00a0 She asked me how many words I thought he had (about 20).\u00a0 She asked me how many of those words someone else could understand (about 10).\u00a0 And she asked me how many of those words that someone else could understand were also spontaneous. Spontaneous? Meaning how many did he say on his own without prompting, without repeating. About five.\u00a0 Sigh. The therapist wrote down a bunch of notes and asked Lewis questions.\u00a0 He could follow two or three step directions but wouldn\u2019t say anything to her.\u00a0 I figured I needed to chime in here.\u00a0 He  has  words, I told her.\u00a0 I said I felt like I was walking a fine line telling her things, but I wanted to be honest.\u00a0 I want him to get help if he needs it, but I was afraid that by telling her the things he could do, it might change his score, leaving him ineligible for services.\u00a0 But I needed to give her the whole picture.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t fair to Lewis, to the therapist, or to the system if I didn\u2019t. So I told her everything.\u00a0 I told her he could count to 12, but wasn\u2019t sure if anyone else could understand him.\u00a0 She asked to hear that, and as she listened, she shook her head.\u00a0 \u201cI probably would have known he was saying \u2018two\u2019, but only because I knew the context\u201d.\u00a0 I told her he knew all the letters of the alphabet, and tried to sing along with songs but no words came out.\u00a0 I told her that even though I knew he could say \u201cMama\u201d, he never actually called me that.\u00a0 I told her that I know he understands everything, but he\u2019s starting to get frustrated because he can\u2019t get us to figure out what he wants. The therapist told me she appreciated my honesty and understood exactly what I was saying.\u00a0 The counting and the letters, while great, isn\u2019t really \u201cspeech\u201d in her opinion.\u00a0 It\u2019s just rote sounds back.\u00a0 She\u2019s looking for labels of nouns, verbs to get his wants and needs across, and expressive language.\u00a0 She sat there and scored the speech portion of the Michigan while Lewis had a snack.\u00a0 Then she scored it again.\u00a0 And again. She looked up at me and her face said it all.\u00a0 Yes, his speech was delayed.\u00a0 But not delayed enough for services. Same old story for us.\u00a0 Just like our evaluation in May, and just like almost all of Howie\u2019s evaluations, we\u2019re smack dab in the middle of the \u201cgray area\u201d. I could tell the therapist felt terrible.\u00a0 She told me that she knows he needs help and would really benefit from services.\u00a0 She\u2019s worried about the gap between his expressive and receptive language, and is concerned that he\u2019ll start to get frustrated and we\u2019ll see behavioral problems creep out.\u00a0 She could pick him up under \u201cclinical judgment\u201d for six months, but just like she told me last time, she\u2019s worried that we\u2019d lose time when he really needed it \u2013 the 2 1/2 yrs old to 3 years old time frame, where the speech demands are so much higher.\u00a0 She recommended waiting again until January, doing another eval, and then she could pick him up from February to August, right before he starts preschool. In addition, she gave me some new tips for getting Lewis to start talking.\u00a0 She told me to \u201csabotage\u201d his day a bit when it was just the two of us home, keeping things from him until he attempts the word.\u00a0 I should concentrate on getting Lewis to say the last sound of the word, because he would use the same \u201cb\u201d sound for \u201cbus\u201d and \u201cball\u201d.\u00a0 She recommended that I focus on just saying one word, not a two word combination.\u00a0 At that point, I had been trying to get him to say \u201cmore juice\u201d, but in her opinion getting him to say just \u201cjuice\u201d was the most important part. (on a side soapbox note, the therapist also told me that if we had qualified, the fees would have been significantly higher than we had paid in the past.\u00a0 Because of budget cuts, the department of public health was forced to either raise fees or increase eligibility requirements even more \u2013 by a 50% delay.\u00a0 That meant that two year old would have to be speaking at a one year old level in order to qualify for help, thereby missing a whole group of kiddos who need help.\u00a0 Of course, we all know that it means that when those kids get to school, their delays would have been SO significant that the department of education would have been footing the bill\u2026same pot of money, just different department.\u00a0 Just dumb.\u00a0 ok, off the soapbox) So, long story even longer\u2026 This past week we\u2019ve been trying really hard to implement her suggestions.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t let him down from his high chair until he said \u201cdone\u201d instead of \u201cda\u201d.\u00a0 If he wanted a banana, he had to say it and not \u201cna na\u201d.\u00a0 And if he wanted out of his crib, he had to tell me \u201chi, Mama\u201d. It\u2019s working.\u00a0 He says \u201cdone\u201d \u2013 the whole word \u2013 when he\u2019s finished eating.\u00a0 He\u2019s saying \u201cba nana\u201d (with the space).\u00a0 And while he\u2019s still not calling for me with \u201cmama\u201d, he will repeat \u201chi mama\u201d perfectly when I say it first. Great, right?\u00a0 So why do I feel so guilty? In one week of intensive work on my part, we\u2019re getting somewhere.\u00a0 It\u2019s not like he caught up in a week, or will even catch up in a month, but we made progress.\u00a0 Because I was giving him my attention.\u00a0 You know, what a mother should do.\u00a0 A mother who is able to focus on her kid.\u00a0 A mother who isn\u2019t completely exhausted with\u2026everything else.\u00a0 I know it\u2019s pointless to play the \u201cwhat if\u201d game, but in this case I can\u2019t help it. Now it\u2019s time for us both to play catch up. \u201cI may know the word \nBut not say it \nI may love the fruit \nBut not taste it \nI may know the way \nTo comfort & to soothe \nA worried face \nBut fold my hands \nIndifferent\u201d   \u2013 I May Know The Word by Natalie Merchant \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/09/15/could-we-start-again-please/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/history-repeating/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/09/23/i-may-know-the-word/", "title": "\n\t\t\tI May Know the\u00a0Word\t\t"},

And I feel compelled to say simply this: When we scrambled to write our vows the morning of our wedding, I never realized how one phrase would continue to ring true for me.\u00a0 On that chilly October day, I told him that I loved how he \u201cmade me laugh when I wanted to cry.\u201d At the time I was talking about the loss of my father. Now it\u2019s about our daily struggles as a family. A true partner knows just what to say when you need them to say it.\u00a0 To create perspective.\u00a0 To see the joy when all you can see is the pain.\u00a0 And loves you even on the days when you don\u2019t love yourself.\u00a0 I am lucky enough to have that a million times over.

{"date": "October 31, 2010", "body": "I had it all planned out for my big November 1st \u201c Autistics Speaking Day \u201d post. I was writing it in response to the movement by an  Australian based organization , trying to get people to stay off Facebook and Twitter for 24 hours today, as a way of showing solidarity and support for those with autism. I was going to write why I wasn\u2019t going to be silent on this day.\u00a0 You know, I\u2019m all for awareness of any type, but something about this just didn\u2019t sit right with me.\u00a0 Part of that was about my ego \u2013 I just didn\u2019t think that my Facebook friends and followers on Twitter would notice or even care if I was silent for a day.\u00a0 Contrary to what my husband thinks, I\u2019m not on there all day long. Then there was the staying silent part.\u00a0 My child is quite verbal, and we\u2019ve worked really hard to improve his communication and social speech skills.\u00a0 Being quiet is contrary to that.\u00a0 And I\u2019m guessing that my friends with non-verbal children would do anything to hear words.\u00a0 Any words.\u00a0 Most of them have moved heaven and earth to help their child communicate.\u00a0 Why would I stay silent to recognize that? So I was going to use this space to tell you about my amazing son Howie.\u00a0 How at age four he looks to the outside world like every other four year old, but he\u2019s not.\u00a0 We work incredibly hard every hour of every day to help him look that way.\u00a0 I was going to tell you that his teacher calls it a \u201cdance\u201d \u2013 most kids test their boundaries but are able to dance that line and pull back to  appropriate behavior.\u00a0 My kid can\u2019t.\u00a0 He has to be constantly reminded how to  pull back, and if I let up at all, he dances gleefully across that line and  we\u2019re done. I was going to write about the hours of behavior therapy and occupational therapy we\u2019ve been through to get us to the point where he can function in an inclusion classroom with an one-on-one aide and can finally draw a picture without a giant meltdown. I was going to write about what autism is like in my house. Then\u2026 An e-mail.\u00a0 From an acquaintance. Her young child had just been diagnosed on the spectrum.\u00a0 On Wednesday.\u00a0 She had found my essays online and having nowhere else to turn, got in touch with me.\u00a0 She was devastated.\u00a0 Overwhelmed.\u00a0 Sad, confused, upset, bewildered\u2026you name it.\u00a0 She had been blindsided.\u00a0 A routine checkup turned into something else. I sent her my phone number.\u00a0 And we talked. The words she spoke were so familiar.\u00a0 How did I miss this, she said.\u00a0 What am I not seeing?\u00a0 He talks, he makes some eye contact \u2013 how is he on the spectrum?\u00a0 No one sees this in him.\u00a0 My family and friends think the doctors are crazy.\u00a0 What did I do to cause this?\u00a0 Do I change his diet?\u00a0 Not vaccinate?\u00a0 Where will he go to school?\u00a0 How will I deal with therapists in my home all week?\u00a0 Will he have friends?\u00a0 What do I tell my other children?\u00a0 Will he ever be normal?\u00a0 And what the hell is ABA therapy? She cried.\u00a0 I did too. I know those questions all too well.\u00a0 We were asking the same ones almost a year ago ourselves.\u00a0 I know the grief of realizing your child might be different.\u00a0 I know how it feels when your world feels like it\u2019s falling down around you. I told her all that.\u00a0 With my words. I told her I knew exactly what she was saying.\u00a0 I have grieved for the life I thought we might have with our son \u2013 the preschool class that I thought he\u2019d attend, the family trips I thought we\u2019d make.\u00a0 I have been in the position of explaining to family and friends why my son is different even though they can\u2019t see it.\u00a0 I told her that I have been just as overwhelmed and guilt-ridden as she was.\u00a0 But I also told her that although it might be too soon to hear it, things can get easier.\u00a0 The earlier the interventions start, the better they work.\u00a0 I told her that my son has made remarkable improvements in the 8 months since his diagnosis thanks to his amazing teachers and great therapies. I told her I was here for her whenever she needed to talk. She said when she read my article it was like hearing her own words in her head.\u00a0 When she had no one else to turn to, she bravely reached out for a shoulder to cry on. If I had remained silent, she would be feeling all alone. So many kids are being diagnosed on the spectrum every day. So many parents are hearing the words \u201cyour child is autistic\u201d for the first time. So many parents are feeling like they have no one who knows what they are going through. If we aren\u2019t talking, if we aren\u2019t sharing OUR stories, how will anyone know that we understand?\u00a0 How will they know that we get it? This is why I\u2019m not going to be silent today.\u00a0 I need to talk.\u00a0 I need to share my story anywhere I can. Because I also need to know that I\u2019m not alone as well. \u201c Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry \n Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry \u201d \u2013 Voices Carry by Til Tuesday \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thecoffeeklatchblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/communicate-to-educate-24-hour-autism.html", "https://communicationshutdown.org/?view=home"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/10/31/voices-carry/", "title": "\n\t\t\tVoices\u00a0Carry\t\t"},
{"date": "October 11, 2010", "body": "The Scene: Pizzeria Uno\u2019s Restaurant The Date: October 7th, 2010 The Occasion: Our Anniversary The Players: The Whole Family \u00a0 Our main character had a great plan for that night, or so she thought.\u00a0 The whole family out to celebrate.\u00a0 She had forgotten that it was a Thursday night and the kids were usually physically and emotionally spent after the long week of school.\u00a0 She neglected to notice that they wouldn\u2019t be eating until almost 6pm, about 45 minutes later than they usually do.\u00a0 And she had forgotten, maybe on purpose, that one of her kids has autism spectrum disorder.\u00a0 She just wanted a nice dinner out with her family for her anniversary, dammit.\u00a0 Just this one time. \n I sent Tim an e-mail around 4:30pm asking if he wanted to meet us out for dinner for our anniversary.\u00a0 Seemed like a pretty good plan at the time.\u00a0 It had finally stopped raining, Gerry didn\u2019t have any homework, and Lewis had taken a pretty good nap.\u00a0 Plus, I had to go out anyway to get some special cupcakes for Howie to bring in to school so he could eat a treat along with the other kids celebrating birthdays.\u00a0 We agreed to meet at the restaurant at 5:30pm. My first mistake happened before we even left the house.\u00a0 Howie had asked me for some juice as I was packing up our toys/cars/coloring books/yogurts/juice boxes for dinner.\u00a0 I ignored it, thinking I\u2019d remember to bring his juice cup in the car with me.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 His juice cup is his comfort \u2013 when he\u2019s feeling out of sorts or not feeling great, he asks for juice.\u00a0 He asked three times.\u00a0 I missed it, and told him in the car that he\u2019d have to wait until we got to Uno\u2019s. Tim was running late from work, so I brought the boys into the restaurant myself.\u00a0 We used to go to Uno\u2019s a few times a month, until it starting getting too expensive once all five of us were each ordering our own meals.\u00a0 In the past, we\u2019ve sat on one side of the restaurant \u2013 the side where the windows face the parking lot where we park.\u00a0 This time, the host brought us to another side \u2013 a side where the walls were too high for Howie to see out of from his seat.\u00a0 Cue meltdown number one\u2026 With Lewis in one arm, my bag of food and tricks slung over the other arm, I dragged Howie screaming across the restaurant to our booth.\u00a0 Wailing \u201cBUT I WANT TO SIT OVER THERE!!\u201d, I grabbed him by the arm and pulled him into the bench seat of the booth, while the host took about an hour to get me a highchair for Lewis.\u00a0 Gerry slunk into the corner of the other bench.\u00a0 Lewis threw the crayons onto the floor.\u00a0 Howie continued with \u201cMama! Mama! Mamaaaaaa!\u201d \u2013 his cry when he can\u2019t formulate the words to tell me what is wrong. (Now I know at this moment I could have stopped this.\u00a0 Well, I know it now.\u00a0 I could have asked the host to move us.\u00a0 I could have calmly tried to understand from Howie what the problem was.\u00a0 And had I known that things were going to continue to spiral downhill from here, I probably would have said something.\u00a0 But instead I dug in my heels.\u00a0 And I turned around and yelled at Howie to stop or else he would be waiting for us all in the car with Dad.\u00a0 You know, whenever Dad got there.) The world\u2019s most indifferent waitress came over to take our drink order, and I told her we were actually ready to order our food.\u00a0 Tim had already given me his pizza-no-cheese order, Gerry and Lewis always get the same thing, and I had brought Howie\u2019s yogurt to have with french fries.\u00a0 I was trying to order all this while Howie was trying to climb into my lap\u2026check that, climb into my skin\u2026still screaming \u201cMama! Mama! Mama!\u201d.\u00a0 The waitress looked annoyed to have to be listening to me through all of that.\u00a0 Imagine trying to talk through it. The waitress quickly ran away to process our order, I got Lewis drawing circles on the kids\u2019 menu, and I was finally able to turn my attention to Howie.\u00a0 \u201cWhat IS it???\u201d I asked him, much more loudly than I wanted to. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sit HERE!\u201d, he shouted.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t like the fans and the red light on the seat!!\u201d I looked up.\u00a0 Above our heads were several circular fans, including one very old one up near the ceiling.\u00a0 They were off, but for some reason were still bothering Howie.\u00a0 And on top of each of the posts near our booth were two red lights.\u00a0 Completely innocuous to the untrained eye.\u00a0 Totally overwhelming to the kid already on sensory overload. \u201cI want to sit where there are yellow lights!\u00a0 Not the red ones!!\u201d Thankfully Tim arrived at this moment.\u00a0 He took Howie away from the table to look at the giant fans to see how they worked.\u00a0 I walked around the restaurant with him to show him that none of the tables had yellow lights, and that if we sat at a certain angle, we couldn\u2019t see them anymore. We sat back down at our table and Howie climbed into my lap.\u00a0 He turned around and gave me one of his hugs \u2013 the ones that tell me he\u2019s trying so hard to calm his body down and feel better.\u00a0 The hugs that dig deep into the skin on my neck and tear at my soul.\u00a0 While he\u2019s hugging me, he whispers into my ear: \u201cWhy is everything in my life so difficult?\u201d At this point, our main character\u2019s eyes filled up with tears.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know, sweetie.\u201d, she says. \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 \n \u201c\u2018Lady Peaceful,\u2019 \u2018Lady Happy,\u2019 \n  That\u2019s what I long to be \n  All the odds are in my favor \n  Something\u2019s bound to begin \n  It\u2019s got to happen, happen sometime \n  Maybe this time I\u2019ll win\u201d  \u2013 Maybe This Time from Cabaret \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/maybe-this-time/", "title": "\n\t\t\tMaybe This Time\t\t"},
{"date": "August 7, 2010", "body": "I just registered to walk for our local \u201c Walk Now for Autism Speaks \u201c.  I\u2019ve known about the walk for a while, but just today got up the guts to actually register for the event. The guts, you say?  It\u2019s a one mile walk around a race track.  What guts does that take? Well for me, a lot.  When I first read about the event, I decided we weren\u2019t going to participate.  I had a million reasons as usual.  I would have to schelp the whole family into Boston early in the morning.  It\u2019s the week before my first 5K and I didn\u2019t want another thing to have to think about.  I hate asking people for money.  There would be a lot of people there, and I\u2019d have to manage my family with the crowds.  I hate porta-potties.   Of course, as usual, these weren\u2019t the real reasons for my hesitation.  I just wasn\u2019t sure if I was ready yet to do it. When my son was first diagnosed, we started getting a lot of information from our local autism resource center.  One of the events they were promoting was a race/walk to raise money to support that center.  Feeling bombarded and overwhelmed by everything, my husband and I decided we weren\u2019t going to participate.  The fact that it was happening on a weekend that we were going to be away helped that decision, but truthfully we couldn\u2019t have done it even if we were around.  It wasn\u2019t that we were in denial, although there were still a few doctors questioning if our son had been misdiagnosed (our pediatrician thought he had ADD, our GI thought maybe it was bad reflux or an allergy).  I think we just weren\u2019t ready to announce to the world that our son was autistic.  Or at least it seemed like that\u2019s what we would have been saying if we participated in that fundraiser. Fast forward to now, several months later, and it\u2019s clear our son wasn\u2019t misdiagnosed.  Along the way our family has slowly come to terms with what his diagnosis means for him and for us all. Hiding in the shadows of our pride didn\u2019t help anyone, especially our son.  While still attempting to maintain our privacy, we\u2019ve opened up more to family and friends about what his autism means and we\u2019ve met some amazing people along the way.  I\u2019ve helped start a support group to reach out to other families in our town so we all feel less alone. I write this blog, for goodness sakes.  Can\u2019t get more public than that. But still the hesitation came when I saw the e-mail about the  Autism Speaks  walk.  Why was it that I was still so uncomfortable about signing up? It\u2019s taken me until today to figure it out.  As \u201cout there\u201d as I thought I was, through our group and through this blog, it\u2019s still been within my comfort zone, surrounded by people I know or anonymous people in cyberspace.  By participating in the walk, by asking people for money, by actually walking that day with my kids, I was no longer going to be a just a quiet voice in the corner.  I would be out there with the potential to be photographed, interviewed, and questioned about my son.  It brought me back to that first day when I walked into the gymnastics class just for kids on the spectrum.  I spent that whole time wondering if we were in the right place until the end when I realized that we belonged there. And it hit me.  We belonged at the walk just like we belonged at the gymnastics class. The Autism Speaks walk is the perfect place for us to feel like we\u2019re among friends.  It\u2019s a one mile walk followed by activities and entertainment geared towards families like mine. No one there will care if we get there late because we couldn\u2019t get out of the house on time, or have a meltdown on the track, or a tantrum leaving.  I\u2019m guessing we won\u2019t be the only ones.  This is also an organization that has given our family so much \u2013 it was the first place I went for information after my son\u2019s diagnosis, and it was the place that published my  essay  about that gymnastics class.  That essay is now included in their  100-day kit , which is sent out to families all over the world to help them understand what to do after receiving their child\u2019s autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. Now that I\u2019ve registered for the walk I\u2019m hoping that a few friends will join me too.  If they don\u2019t, I understand completely.  If someone had asked me last week if I wanted to walk with them, I might have said no.  We all need to get to that place in our own time.  I don\u2019t want anyone to feel like it\u2019s something they  have  to do.  For me this is something I finally WANT to do.   If you\u2019re looking for me there, I\u2019ll be the one trying to blend in with the crowd. \u201c Walk on through the wind, \nWalk on through the rain, \nTho\u2019 your dreams be tossed and blown.Walk on, walk on \nWith hope in your heart \nAnd you\u2019ll never walk alone, \nYou\u2019ll never walk alone. \u201d \u2013 You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone by Rodgers and Hammerstein \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.walknowforautismspeaks.org/site/c.igIRL6PIJrH/b.4356939/k.BF85/Home.htm", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/community/ownwords/intheirownwords_butler.php", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/community/family_services/100_day_kit.php"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/youll-never-walk-alone/", "title": "\n\t\t\tYou\u2019ll Never Walk\u00a0Alone\t\t"},
{"date": "September 29, 2010", "body": "School of Parenting Course: Sleep Management 101 \u201cSleep Baby Sleep\u201d \u2013 Case Study #1: The Butler Family Corporation The Butler Family Corporation is a medium sized group located in a fairly small community.\u00a0 The corporation is headed by the co-CEOs, Mr and Mrs. Butler.\u00a0 They have three young boys ranging in age from almost 2 to eight years old.\u00a0 The company\u2019s main job is to provide clothing, food, shelter, unconditional love and guidance to the three boys to help create new valuable members of society. Sleep has been an issue for the Butler Corporation almost since its first member joined a little over eight years ago.\u00a0 The first child, Gerry, was a terrible sleeper.\u00a0 While originally thought to be caused by the use of cloth diapers (Mrs. Butler thought that using them made Gerry wake up every time he was wet), the main reason for the child\u2019s sleep issues were that he liked being with someone when sleeping.\u00a0 Gerry took his naps on or next to Mr. and Mrs. Butler until he was 20 months old, until Mrs. Butler finally developed a good nap time routine.\u00a0 Night times were more difficult, and while Gerry started out in his crib at night eventually he made his way into Mr. and Mrs. Butler\u2019s bed.\u00a0 Mrs. Butler was quite ashamed of this behavior, since all her friends had their kids sleeping in their own beds.\u00a0 She never talked about it with anyone outside of the corporate inner circle.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until Gerry was over 4 years old that he stayed in his bed all night long. He has been there ever since. About that time, the next member of the corporation arrived.\u00a0 Howie\u2019s bedtime struggles were worse.\u00a0 Howie was colicky and woke up every 45 minutes to nurse.\u00a0 He would only sleep if touching someone, and even then was up all the time.\u00a0 Nap times were worse \u2013 every nap was on someone\u2019s lap and even those naps were usually cat naps.\u00a0 The problems were compounded by the fact that Mrs. Butler was also trying to take care of Gerry\u2019s needs, so Gerry ended up watching a lot of TV and playing on his own while Howie slept.\u00a0 Howie\u2019s sleep issues became such a problem that Mrs. Butler took him to see many experts, including Dr. Ferber\u2019s sleep clinic at Children\u2019s Hospital at age 2.\u00a0 Howie (and Mrs. Butler) endured one overnight sleep study and one 24 hour EEG.\u00a0 The results showed abnormal brain \u201cblips\u201d that were diagnosed by Dr. Ferber\u2019s colleague as \u201crolandic benign epilepsy\u201d.\u00a0 Mrs. Butler was told to basically ignore this \u2013 there had been no evidence of seizures and if none were observed by the time Howie was 11 or 12 years old, then he had outgrown the diagnosis.\u00a0 Mrs. Butler was sent home with instructions to leave Howie in his crib screaming, and if he threw up, she was to clean it up and leave him in there, basically telling her that the sleep problems were a result of poor parenting routines.\u00a0 Mrs. Butler was beside herself with this, and after a few nights of Mr. Butler trying the technique, Howie was back in the bed with them. Mrs. Butler began to look for other reasons why Howie wasn\u2019t sleeping, including reflux or allergies.\u00a0 Howie went through more testing to rule out anything physiological.\u00a0 Mrs. Butler had also found out around this time that another member would be joining the corporation in nine months, and the search for answers became desperate.\u00a0 Mr. and Mrs. Butler knew that Howie had to get out of their bed with another baby on the way.\u00a0 Mrs. Butler spent several months of her pregnancy sleeping on the floor next to Howie\u2019s mattress, as well as sleeping in Howie\u2019s big boy bed with him.\u00a0 Early Intervention had been called in at this point, and Howie had been given the diagnosis of Sensory Processing Disorder by their occupational therapist (and later at age 3 1/2 his autism spectrum diagnosis).\u00a0 He started working with the OT on his sensory issues and that was leading to some success at the sleep level. In the fall of 2008, the final member of the corporation arrived.\u00a0 Lewis was a better sleeper from the start.\u00a0 However, he still started out in the bed with Mrs. Butler to ease with feeding as she recovered from her third C-section and almost 3 years of sleep deprivation.\u00a0 Determined not to make the same mistake a third time, Mr. Butler made it his mission to get Lewis to sleep in his crib as soon as possible, especially since Howie was still having several night wakings per night.\u00a0 Mr. Butler successfully achieved his goal on Christmas Day 2009, and from that moment on Lewis napped and slept in his crib through the night. There was a period of time when sleep was going quite well for the members of the corporation.\u00a0 Gerry was continuing to sleep fine on his own.\u00a0 Thanks to weighted blankets, melatonin and a better understanding of sensory issues, Howie was sleeping through the night in his own bed at least 75% of the week.\u00a0 He still needed someone to lay next to him while falling asleep, but was usually able to stay there all night long.\u00a0 Lewis would go to bed in his crib at the same time as everyone else, and would stay asleep until the morning.\u00a0 Mr. Butler was finally getting some sleep. Mrs. Butler on the other hand, was having trouble.\u00a0 She would wake up every few hours waiting for the shoe to drop.\u00a0 After over 4 years of not sleeping, she was having trouble training herself to sleep soundly again.\u00a0 Every noise she heard on the monitor or from the boys\u2019 rooms in the middle of the night sent her out of bed quickly, trying to manage the situation before the whole house woke up.\u00a0 If Lewis cried a bit, she would run into his room and pop his pacifier back in.\u00a0 If Howie moaned or shuffled in his bed while sleeping, she quickly fixed his covers and weighted blanket so he would settle back down again.\u00a0 Mrs. Butler knew that the alternative might be hours of screaming and crying, causing everyone in the house to be awake.\u00a0 She was willing to sacrifice her sleep to make sure everyone else was getting the rest they needed. This has been an ongoing issue for Mrs. Butler and the whole Butler corporation.\u00a0 Recently, things have changed back to old sleeping patterns.\u00a0 Gerry, while sleeping through the night, is having a hard time  falling  asleep.\u00a0 Howie\u2019s night wakings have returned, and increasing the melatonin dosage has not helped.\u00a0 And Lewis, previously the best sleeper in the house, is fighting naps and bedtime, and is up two or three times during the night. The challenges for the Butler Corporation regarding sleep are many.\u00a0 The lack of sleep causes irritability and quick-tempered behavior from everyone, but especially Mrs. Butler.\u00a0 This is especially hard for her because she has never considered herself a \u201cyeller\u201d.\u00a0 The Butler Corporation is at their wits end, and would do anything for one good night\u2019s rest. The Case Questions:\u00a0 As special counsel to the Butler Corporation, please identify and evaluate one or two strategies that you think would help keep this company afloat.\u00a0 Consider the solutions that they have already tried, and analyze where they might have chosen a different path.\u00a0 Recommend a specific action plan to help them more efficiently manage sleep in their house. And if you can\u2019t do that, just let them know that this happens in your house too, and that they are not alone in their sleep misery. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \u201c Sleep, baby, sleep \nYour father tends the sheep \nYour mother shakes the dreamland tree \nAnd from it fall sweet dreams for thee \nSleep, baby, sleep \nSleep, baby, sleep \u201d \u2013 Sleep Baby Sleep, A Lullaby \n \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/sleep-baby-sleep/", "title": "\n\t\t\tSleep Baby Sleep\t\t"},

What\u2019s the best thing about being a big brother? The best thing is that your little brothers are looking up at you as a role model. What\u2019s the hardest thing? The hardest thing is that my 4 year old brother can be a little annoying sometimes. What\u2019s your favorite thing to do with your 4 year old brother? I like it when my room is clean enough and he can come in and play. What\u2019s one happy time together with him? He likes to run and jump over a small couch, so most of the time I do it with him. What was an unhappy or hard time? When he is eating he chews with his mouth open which annoys me. What does it mean to you that your brother is autistic? It means that his brain developed differently than normal people. What\u2019s the hardest thing about having a younger brother with autism? He can\u2019t really control certain situations.\u00a0 It\u2019s\u00a0 hard for me because if I\u2019m sitting in the green chair and he wants to sit there, he pretty much gets his way, otherwise he goes off screaming or unhappy. Is there anything you would change about your relationship?\u00a0 What would you keep the same forever? I wish he could control certain situations, so if he was making his silly noises, and someone asked him to stop, he would and ask where he could make those noises. I would keep what he likes \u2013 his Hot Wheels cars and the food he likes \u2013 the same because I like them too.\u00a0 I don\u2019t really want to change his personality. Imagine it is 20 years from now.\u00a0 What do you see you and your brothers doing? I would be 28, and my brothers would be 24 and 21 years old.\u00a0 So we\u2019d all probably have a car.\u00a0 I think we\u2019d be sitting on a couch \u2013 well, one of us sitting on a chair \u2013 watching baseball together. \u201c Brothers and sisters, sisters and brothers \nEach and every one \nSisters and brothers, brothers and sisters \nEvery mother\u2019s daughter, every father\u2019s son Ain\u2019t we lucky, everybody \nBein\u2019 everybody\u2019s brother \nAin\u2019t we lucky, everybody \nLookin\u2019 out for one another \u201d \u2013 Sisters and Brothers from the Free to Be You and Me soundtrack \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/08/12/sisters-and-brothers/", "title": "\n\t\t\tSisters and Brothers\t\t"},
{"date": "August 22, 2010", "body": "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about the show \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d. Stay with me for a moment\u2026 I was recently reading one of my favorite blogs written by my new friend  Partly Sunny .  I call her my friend even though I\u2019ve never met her and have only \u201cconversed\u201d with her through our blogs and by e-mail.  She has a perspective on all things autism that is different from mine, and recently she asked me if she was upsetting me with some of her comments.  My response was of course not, that I respected her opinions and point of view, and I found her comments to be refreshing and important to hear. All this started me thinking about my new community of parents with kids on the spectrum and parents of kids with sensory processing disorder (and in so many cases, these parents are one and the same).  We listen to each others\u2019 stories, comment on them, and then tell our own and get our own comments.  I\u2019ve been lucky enough to meet an amazing group of parents out there in cyberspace and in person.  I enjoy hearing their stories and others do me the favor of listening to mine. And for some reason, all of my new friends reminded me of the show \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d. Still with me? \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d was a show back in the mid to late 1980\u2019s about four older women living in Miami.  Each woman had a distinct personality and role on the show.  I\u2019ll out myself as a faithful watcher those Saturday nights through high school (now you know how exciting my life was back then).  There was Dorothy, played by Bea Arthur, the voice of reason in the group and clearly the one in charge.  Her mother, Sophia, was played by Estelle Getty, and was the wise-cracking sarcastic one, yet lovable in her own way.  There was Blanche, the sassy southern belle man-chaser with a heart of gold played by Rue McClanahan.  And my favorite, played by Betty White, was Rose.  She was naive and took everything literally.  She was the sweetheart of the group and the one they protected the most from the outside world.   So on Saturday nights for seven years (and for decades in syndication), these women entertained America.  On the surface, they had very little in common and disagreed on a lot.  Yet they had a formed a bond stronger than those disagreements, and at the end of every episode there was some sort of group hug.   That\u2019s what this amazing community feels like to me. I read a lot of blogs and websites and have the good fortune to have people reading mine, and have made many friends along the way.  We have our voices of reason like Dorothy who guide us in the right direction.  There are the wise-crackers like Sophia who are always there with a joke or comment to make us laugh. There are the sassy Blanches with the heart of gold.  And of course, our sweet Roses who will always say the nicest things to make us feel better, even when the situation is dire and sad.  We disagree on a lot \u2013 the causes of autism, what treatment methods to use, and whether or not we should look for a cure.  In many ways we have almost nothing in common.  To extrapolate on a saying \u201cif you\u2019ve met one parent of an autistic child, you\u2019ve met ONE parent of an autistic child\u201d.  Yet remarkably we have one strong bond: the desire to be there for each other in whatever way we can.  Because we \u201cget it\u201d.  Because we\u2019ve been there.  And because we need people to be there for us. Just like the end of every \u201cGolden Girls\u201d episode, each night before I go to bed I feel like I\u2019m getting a big group hug from everyone out there.  Every comment that I read, either on my blog or on others, reminds me that people care.  Every text or e-mail I get from my friends shows me that I\u2019m not alone.  Each day my faith in humanity is restored by the Dorothys, Sophias, Blanches and Roses out there in cyberspace and in my daily life.   Thank you all for being my friends. \u201c Thank you for being a friend \nTraveled down the road and back again \nYour heart is true your a pal and a confidant.

{"date": "August 27, 2010", "body": "I\u2019m not a big fan of what I call \u201cobligation holidays\u201d.  I\u2019m talking about days like Valentine\u2019s Day, New Year\u2019s Eve, and even my birthday.  Holidays when you feel like you\u2019re supposed to be doing something.  Everyone asks what you\u2019re doing on those days, and there\u2019s the expectation that you need to do something great \u2013 a fabulous dinner, flowers, a midnight kiss. When it doesn\u2019t happen, there\u2019s a feeling of total failure.  The end-of-the-day giant letdown.   Summer has always felt like one big long obligation holiday. There\u2019s the anticipation at the beginning of summer.  Oh, we\u2019re going to go on a trip, and go to the beach, and have cook-outs and family bike rides.  This will be the year we finally take the boat out again, and\u2026 (that last one is a tough one for me\u2026the boat has been sitting in our garage for six years now.  Tim and I used to talk about it every spring, thinking that maybe  this  will be the summer that we\u2019ll rent a place on the lake for a week and spend the whole day out on the water like we used to do before\u2026well, before everything.  We don\u2019t even mention it anymore.  We both just stare at the boat in silence as we stack strollers and scooters and trash cans up against it.) This summer I decided to break the cycle.  I know our family better now.  I know our limitations and have a better understanding of what we can and can\u2019t do.  I set zero expectations for this summer.  And as I wrote back in  June , I dug my heels in and started counting the days until September. And now, Gerry starts school on Tuesday, and Howie the week after that.  Gerry has a memory bag that his new teacher gave him on the last day of school, and he\u2019s supposed to put special things in there from his summer adventures.  I remember getting sad looking at it, knowing that I had nothing special planned, and just hoping we could find a thing or two so the bag wouldn\u2019t be empty when he returned to school. So here I sit now, the last Friday of August.  I\u2019m trying to figure out what we could put in that bag. The truth is, quite a lot.  Here\u2019s what we did on our summer vacation: -attended a  wedding  (my mom\u2019s) \n-went to  Storyland \n-went blueberry picking* \n-went to the  library \n-played at the park (not once, not twice, but three times)* \n-went bowling* \n-went to the zoo* \n-shopped at the mall \n-went to the beach (just me, Gerry and Howie) \n-took family walks \n-taught Howie how to ride his  bike \n-played in the backyard \n-went to the New England Aquarium \n-saw a ballgame at Fenway Park (ok, this was just Tim and Gerry, but still cool) \n-went to birthday parties (two of them \u2013 both Howie\u2019s friends, first time ever) \n-had playdates \n-took all three boys swimming in friends\u2019 pools (once even by myself!) \n-survived camp/summer school/swim lessons (just barely) \n-had a sleepover (Gerry\u2019s first\u2026more on this another time) \n-bounced in a bounce house.  All five of us together. note: the (*) next to some of the activities on the list means I did them with the assistance of a mother\u2019s helper.  I hired the 15 year old daughter of Howie\u2019s one-on-one aide to help me out two mornings a week on the days when Howie wasn\u2019t at his summer school.  The best decision I ever made and worth every penny.  I\u2019m pretty sure this summer would have been an even longer one had I not done that.  I\u2019m forever grateful for her help. I\u2019m exhausted just typing that list.  Well, I\u2019m exhausted with a smile on my face. To the average family, that list might not seem so impressive.  It\u2019s probably what most families do during those 12 weeks of summer.  But for us?  Not so average.  Getting us out of the house is sometimes accomplishment enough.  Getting us anywhere is impressive.   Were there days when the minutes seemed like hours and the hours seemed like days?  Absolutely.  Were there days when I thought that all the progress we\u2019d made with Howie this past year had disappeared in an instant?  Definitely.  Were there days when I sat at the computer, trying to hide my tears from the boys?  More than I care to count.  Were there tantrums, meltdowns, and screaming matches at some of those activities?  Oh yes (just ask them at the zoo\u2026) But there were also mornings that started with laughter, when the coffee pot wasn\u2019t the first thing I reached for.  Afternoons filled with baseball, and swings and bike races.  Nights when I fell asleep easily, knowing that we had made the most of the day.   That is our new version of summertime.  The living isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s the best we can do.  I know we\u2019re not the rent-a-place-at-the-lake kind of family.  At least not now. Gerry has several things to put in his memory bag now, including one more to be made today with his dad at the water park.  They\u2019ve waited all summer for the perfect day to go.  Can\u2019t get more perfect than today. \u201c Perfect song on the radio \nSing along \u2019cause it\u2019s one we know \nIt\u2019s a smile, it\u2019s a kiss \nIt\u2019s a sip of wine, it\u2019s summertime \nSweet summertime\u201d  \u2013 Summertime by Kenny Chesney \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/schools-out/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/06/23/going-to-the-chapel/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/07/10/dont-worry-be-happy/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/07/13/taking-chances/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/08/01/beautiful-day/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/08/27/summertime/", "title": "\n\t\t\tSummertime\t\t"},
{"date": "August 20, 2010", "body": "I am completely exhausted.\u00a0 All in the name of science. About three weeks ago, I received a letter in the mail from the Interactive Autism Network, asking if we\u2019d participate in a research project through Children\u2019s Hospital.\u00a0 The study, sponsored by the  Simons Foundation , is looking at families with just one child on the autism spectrum in attempt to understand if there\u2019s a genetic or environmental link to autism.\u00a0 All participants receive an autism evaluation for their child for free. My family fit the research criteria perfectly : only one child with an ASD diagnosis aged 4-17, one or more typically developing sibling older than 4, two biological parents willing to participate, and no other cases of ASD in the immediate or extended family (that we know of). At first, I put the letter into the recycling bin.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t all that interested in putting my family through some research project, and I was somewhat skeptical of the study as a whole.\u00a0 But something kept bringing me back.\u00a0 We fit the criteria  perfectly .\u00a0 What if by gathering data on our family, we were able to help scientists find a cause for autism?\u00a0 What if we were able to help identify ways for earlier detection, and thereby earlier intervention?\u00a0 I did a little research into the  Simons Foundation  and the project in general, talked to Tim about it, and decided to give them a call. I asked all the appropriate questions, and got all the acceptable answers.\u00a0 Yes, it was all anonymous.\u00a0 The blood samples and questionnaires were all assigned an ID number so we could not be identified.\u00a0 The information from the assessment would be ours alone and we could choose to share it with school and/or our doctor if we wanted to.\u00a0 The blood draw would be handled by Children\u2019s Hospital by a team comfortable working with kids on the spectrum (and 8 year olds who are terrified of needles).\u00a0 They would even send us a practice kit and a social story for the blood draw.\u00a0 The kids would be compensated for their participation, and the researchers would come out to the house for the interview portion of the study.\u00a0\u00a0 After getting the ok from Gerry about the blood work (five minutes of torture equaled a new Star Wars Lego set in his mind), we set up the appointment. (speaking of Gerry, we included him fully in the discussion of whether or not to do the study.\u00a0 His participation was important and we thought he was old enough to understand the purpose of the research and how he could be helping scientists discover the cause of autism.\u00a0 He thought about it for a long time, as he is apt to do.\u00a0 He came down on the side of helping kids like his brother.\u00a0 Couldn\u2019t have been more proud of his thought process.\u00a0 The only exception is when I told him that the criteria involved having one kid who is on the spectrum and his other sibling not on the spectrum.\u00a0 His response to me: \u201cwell, I know I\u2019m not.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t know about Lewis yet.\u201d\u00a0 Ugh.\u00a0 That was the kick in the gut that I didn\u2019t need) . So today two researchers came out to the house and spent four hours with me and Howie.\u00a0 One researcher administered the ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) to Howie, and the other one went over the ADI (Autism Diagnostic Interview) with me.\u00a0 Howie did great \u2013 he spent almost the whole four hours at the table with the woman with just a few short breaks.\u00a0 On the other hand, I was a wreck.\u00a0 The questions were incredibly comprehensive and detailed, asking me to recall a million small details of the last four years of our lives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She asked about his speech, social interactions, and what developmental milestones were met or not met.\u00a0 She asked for specific examples of speech patterns and moments of aggression.\u00a0 She asked when we first noticed problems.\u00a0 She asked four straight hours worth of questions. I tried really hard to focus.\u00a0 In so many ways, it was as if I was reliving those years all over again.\u00a0 I could feel myself starting to fidget, and my body language was clearly showing my discomfort.\u00a0 I know this because the whole interview was videotaped, and the little screen was turned around facing us at the table so my crossed legs and arms were staring right back at me.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t help that every question that I answered out loud for Howie I was answering in my head about Lewis.\u00a0 A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing, and I was diagnosing Lewis along the way. After finishing the ADI, we went through two more questionnaires \u2013 one about Howie and one about Gerry.\u00a0 She gave me a few others to complete before our blood draw day at the hospital, including one social behavior questionnaire that I answer about me and one that I answer for Tim (and vice versa \u2013  that  should be interesting).\u00a0 They closed up their video cameras and went on their way around 2pm.\u00a0 Thirty minutes later, Howie was out for a nap.\u00a0 He was done.\u00a0 And so was I. I\u2019m still having some mixed feelings about the whole thing, even after today.\u00a0 We\u2019ll finish up the study at the hospital in a few weeks and get the complete report from the assessments in about 6-8 weeks.\u00a0 I\u2019m not really sure what we\u2019ll do with the information we get.\u00a0 The scientist in me says that I should just file it away, that the point of participating is to help gather data with the hope of discovering a cause of autism spectrum disorder.\u00a0 That\u2019s pure science. Then I remember there is no scientist in me.\u00a0 Just a parent looking for some answers and some hope for the future for myself and my family.

{"date": "August 31, 2010", "body": "I am not a \u201chugger\u201d. I\u2019ve never been one, either.  I\u2019m not sure why.  I\u2019m just not a fan.  When someone comes up to give me a hug, I can feel my body stiffen.  It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a close relative or an acquaintance, it\u2019s just not something I\u2019m comfortable with.  I have learned to cope with it but it\u2019s not my favorite way to greet someone. I\u2019ve understand now that I\u2019m what is called a \u201csensory avoider\u201d.  I don\u2019t like being touched or standing in a crowded room.  Places like Costco and Wal-Mart make me want to run for the hills.\u00a0  I may end up paying more for diapers, but it\u2019s better than having a panic attack next to the giant packages of paper towels. My son Howie, on the other hand, is a hugger.  A huge hugger.  I haven\u2019t officially kept track, but there are days when it feels like he has asked for about a thousand hugs.  And all from me. See the tabloid headline now: \u201cSensory avoider gives birth to sensory seeking kid!\u201d.   I don\u2019t remember learning about this possibility when studying genetics in high school.  Considering my husband is also a sensory avoider, we must both be carriers of the sensory-seeking gene. Howie\u2019s been a sensory seeker since I can remember.  It started mostly with sleep issues, with a constant need to be next to someone (me) while sleeping.  He created a technique he called \u201ctunneling\u201d \u2013 meaning he would stick his hands into the side of my neck and ask me to press my head down into his hand.  This is how he would fall asleep for about two years until we discovered that weighted blankets, body pillows and 2mg of melatonin did the trick, although I still have to lay next to him at night with my arms wrapped around him in a giant hug as he falls asleep. Sometimes when he has a hard time falling asleep or is uneasy in a situation, he still asks if he can \u201ctunnel\u201d. With me.  And only me. The hugs can interfere with our daily routine.  I\u2019m trying to change a diaper, and he needs a hug.  I\u2019m trying to make or eat breakfast/lunch/dinner and he needs a hug.  There are days when he asks me for hugs for hours straight.  I know others see it and think it\u2019s cute.  When we had the  Children\u2019s Hospital  researchers here a few weeks ago, Howie was clearly uneasy about them being in our house.  He asked me over and over again \u201cCan I have a hug?\u201d.  He would say this as he was digging his legs into my lap and his hands into my neck.  The researchers smiled and said \u201caw, that is adorable!\u201d.  It was all I could do not to scream. How awful is that?  My own kid\u2019s hugs can make me want to scream. But it\u2019s because they are more than just hugs, as I tried to explain to the research team.  It\u2019s his cry for help. I\u2019ve learned to differentiate between different hug requests \u2013 ones for when he\u2019s happy and proud, ones for when he\u2019s bored, ones for when his body doesn\u2019t feel right after something he ate, ones for when he\u2019s tired, and ones for when he\u2019s completely out of sorts.  Those last ones are the most difficult, because they hurt the most physically and emotionally.  When he\u2019s unable to regulate his body, he squeezes me so hard that he actually chokes me.  But I know he needs them to make himself feel better, and it takes every inch of my being sometimes to give him the hug back. But I do.  Because I\u2019m his mom.  And I know it could be so much worse. Until he learns how to regulate himself, those hugs are all he has to make him feel right.  We\u2019ve tried to teach him ways to help himself \u2013 squishing under pillows, sitting in the bean bag chair, climbing in the body sock \u2013 and we\u2019re working on giving him better words to use when he\u2019s out of sorts so others can help him.  We\u2019re always showing him more appropriate ways to get the sensory input he so desperately craves.  My husband will pick him up and squeeze him like an accordion (because if he calls it a hug Howie runs screaming away from him), and Gerry will have a gentle pillow fight with him.  My hope is that someday \u201cCan I have a hug?\u201d won\u2019t mean \u201cI need help\u201d.\u00a0  Someday it will  just  mean \u201ccan I have a hug?.\u201d I can\u2019t wait to write that headline. \u201c U can\u2019t touch this \nLook in my eyes,man \nU can\u2019t touch this \nYo, let me bust the funky lyrics \nU can\u2019t touch this \u201d \u2013 You Can\u2019t Touch This by MC Hammer \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/08/20/she-blinded-me-with-science/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/08/31/you-cant-touch-this/", "title": "\n\t\t\tYou Can\u2019t Touch\u00a0This\t\t"},
{"date": "August 10, 2010", "body": "I had a horrible horrible dream last night.  The kind that wakes you up with a start in a cold sweat \u2013 the bolt upright in bed kind of dream that you see in the movies.  The kind where you\u2019re afraid to go back to sleep, because you fear the dream will start back up again where it left off. I won\u2019t go into the details, but it was in the genre of \u201cevery parent\u2019s worst nightmare\u201d kind of dream.  I laid there in bed for a while wide awake, mostly because I was afraid to go back to sleep. For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve always had anxiety dreams.  My college roommate\u2019s dreams were these grand \u201cgood versus evil\u201d extravaganzas, where the players dressed in medieval garb and fought with swords and serpents.  In my dreams, the players are familiar faces, acting out some twisted scene from my subconscious.  I\u2019m a firm believer that my dreams have some sort of message to me, something I\u2019m supposed to do or understand.  It was clear this particular dream was sending me this message: It could be so much harder Let me be clear, I am in no way minimizing how hard life is with a kid on the autism spectrum.  I know that every day, and even every moment, is a struggle sometimes with our kids.  I know that many of us live on the edge, waiting for that moment when our kids will say their own name or give us some recognition that they understand the world around them.  I know the fear and worry that so many of us have about the future for our children, wondering if they\u2019ll be able to grow up and survive in the world without us someday.  But this dream reminded me of the alternative \u2013 the horror of making life and death choices about our kids and the unspeakable pain of outliving them.  I know there are parents out there that suffer with this everyday \u2013 holding their own lives together while they care for their children who can\u2019t walk, or eat, or breathe on their own. So there in bed I laid with all these thoughts swirling around my head.  I spend hours of my day in constant active autism mode.  From the moment we wake up (and even during the night) I\u2019m managing, planning, scheduling, observing, re-planning, and organizing our lives around Howie\u2019s sensory needs.  Activities are planned and timed with these needs in mind in order to minimize tantrums and outbursts.  We avoid certain foods and smells so we don\u2019t set him off.  Our house is full of timers and schedules and body socks and social skills scripts so we can always bring him back to the moment when he\u2019s overloaded. While these are all things necessary to help him cope and understand his world, there are days when I feel like it\u2019s all we do.  When Howie\u2019s running through the house, jumping over pillows with Lewis chasing him, in my head I say \u201che\u2019s getting his energy out because his engine is running high\u201d.  When Howie asks to be pushed higher and higher on the swing, in my head I say \u201che\u2019s getting the sensory input he needs\u201d.  When he\u2019s sitting at a table with his friends having a snack and telling jokes, in my head I say \u201che\u2019s developing good social speech skills\u201d. Why can\u2019t I just look at these situations and in my head say \u201cLook at my Howie.  He\u2019s having fun being a kid\u201d?  Is it because I know too much now?  Have a become so mired in all-things-autism that I can\u2019t look at a situation without identifying what IEP goal is being met at that time? If my dream was showing me anything, it was that I need to be more appreciative of the moments that I have with him and all my boys.  I need to stop always focusing on how Howie\u2019s interactions with us all meet his sensory needs, and just let us\u2026play.  I need to laugh along with Howie and Lewis as they run and crash into the pillows with reckless abandon.  I need to push Howie as high as I can on the swings because he wants me too, and because it\u2019s fun.  I need to sit down at the table with Howie and his friends and tell jokes that only make sense to four year olds, because that\u2019s what four year olds do. My dream showed me that the alternative is unimaginable to me. I finally calmed myself down and fell back to sleep around 3am, about 30 minutes before Howie tried to climb into my bed as he has done on so many nights.  Usually, I take him back to his bed and lay there with him until he falls back to sleep, and then I return to mine.  This time, I pulled him into bed with us.  Tim told me this morning that when he left for work at 5am, I was snuggled up tight against Howie with my arms around him. Doesn\u2019t surprise me.  My dream told me to savor any and every minute I have with my kids, no matter how hard it is in that moment.  Because it could always be unthinkably and unimaginably harder. \u201c These dreams go on when I close my eyes. \nEvery second of the night, I live another life. \nThese dreams that sleep when it\u2019s cold outside, \nEvery moment I\u2019m awake, the further I\u2019m away. \u201d \u2013 These Dreams by Heart \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/08/10/these-dreams/", "title": "\n\t\t\tThese Dreams\t\t"},
{"date": "June 12, 2010", "body": "Last night I spent some time in the company of some amazing women.\u00a0 All mothers, all with school age kids under the age of 10, all of whom \u201cget it\u201d. About a month ago, a friend and I had the idea to start a small support group.\u00a0 The original idea was for mothers or fathers of kids who are on the spectrum, and with the help of the school district, we reached out to parents to see if anyone wanted to meet, just to talk.\u00a0 Our first meeting last month was so nice that we decided to meet again.\u00a0 And last night, our group expanded.\u00a0 Friends brought friends who had kids on IEPs.\u00a0 Friends brought friends who had kids with diagnoses but couldn\u2019t get IEPs.\u00a0 And as the sangria and wine and spinach dip flowed, we sat and just talked.\u00a0 Some of us were meeting for the first time.\u00a0 Without having to say it, we all knew we were in a safe place to share our feelings, vent our frustrations, and tell our stories.\u00a0 When one person talked, the whole room nodded along.\u00a0 Because we all \u201cget it\u201d. This is what we \u201cget\u201d: We \u201cget\u201d that no matter how many books or papers we read about our kids\u2019 issues, we always feel like we\u2019re reinventing the wheel and going it alone. We \u201cget\u201d that even with the best of intentions, sometimes our husbands/family/friends just can\u2019t understand what how challenging our daily lives can be. We \u201cget\u201d that it\u2019s frustrating to have to be our children\u2019s best and sometimes only advocate, and wonder why the teachers/administrators can\u2019t see the struggles that our kids have, and we wonder why it\u2019s so hard sometimes to get them the help them need. We \u201cget\u201d that sometimes you have to do whatever you can just to get through the day (or night), and if that means having your kid sleep in your bed or do laps outside the house at 9pm, then so be it.\u00a0 We know to pick the one or two or three most important battles of the day and deal with the rest. We \u201cget\u201d that you would move heaven and earth to do anything to help your kid, but financially and logistically it\u2019s not always possible.\u00a0 And we understand the guilt that comes with feeling like you\u2019re never doing enough. We \u201cget\u201d that sometimes the stress is too much to handle alone \u2013 the worries and wonder that keep us awake at night long after our kids have come into our beds at 2am.\u00a0 Will our kids talk?\u00a0 Will they succeed in school?\u00a0 Will they have friends? Will they have jobs, go to college, have a family of their own? We \u201cget\u201d that we all have a fear of the playground, birthday parties, and family get togethers.\u00a0 But we know that we have to let go of that fear, surround ourselves with people who care and understand our kids, and get ourselves out there. And we \u201cget\u201d that some of us couldn\u2019t meet past 10:30pm, since that\u2019s about the time when our kids start their night waking routine, and that in many cases we\u2019re the only ones who can comfort them back to sleep. As the sangria dried up and the last of the spinach dip was eaten, I asked everyone if they wanted to meet again, maybe skipping a month until August because summer can get so busy.\u00a0 The general consensus was we didn\u2019t want to wait that long.\u00a0 We wanted \u2013 and maybe needed \u2013 to meet again in July.\u00a0 As one mother put it, \u201cI might get a little crazy if I go that long without meeting with my girls!\u201d\u00a0 Couldn\u2019t have said it better myself. \u201c Lean on me, when you\u2019re not strong \nAnd I\u2019ll be your friend \nI\u2019ll help you carry on \nFor it won\u2019t be long \n\u2018Til I\u2019m gonna need \nSomebody to lean on \u201d \u2013 Lean On Me by Bill Withers. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/06/12/lean-on-me/", "title": "\n\t\t\tLean On\u00a0Me\t\t"},
{"date": "September 20, 2010", "body": "Tonight was Back to School night for my son\u2019s preschool.  As I walked up the steps into the big brick building with all the other parents, a weird feeling came over me.  A little bit of nerves, a little bit of sadness, plus a little bit of something else that I couldn\u2019t quite place. Until I remembered.  This is where it all started.  Exactly one year ago.  This was the night when I realized that my son needed help. Tonight I walked past the classroom he was in last year and glanced in as the parents were taking their seats in the little blue and red chairs arranged on the circle time mat.  One year ago, that was me.  The \u201cMe\u201d with the lump in my throat.  The \u201cMe\u201d that spent every preschool morning arguing and yelling because my son wouldn\u2019t put his shoes on.  The \u201cMe\u201d that dragged him out of school kicking and screaming because playground time was over.  The \u201cMe\u201d that hadn\u2019t slept more than 3 hours straight in 3 years.  The \u201cMe\u201d that just couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on with my kid. I stopped for a moment in the hallway and closed my eyes.  I remember that evening so well.  I remember barely listening to his teacher discuss the preschool curriculum because I was still stuck on how terrible his day at school had been.  I remember half-listening to her story about how the kids had table time, and that one kid (no name given) kept taking other kids\u2019 name tags off the tables and putting his own there because he wanted to play with the trains and only the trains.  I remember knowing in my gut that was Howie, and while the other parents laughed at the anecdote, it made me want to cry. I remember asking the aides in the classroom how things were going for Howie, and their response was \u201cask the teacher.\u201d  I remember staying late after everyone was gone and talking at length with his teacher about his transition issues, his meltdowns and his difficult behavior in the classroom.  She told me that the general accommodations in the classroom weren\u2019t working for Howie anymore.  And I remember  this incredibly smart and astute teacher  telling me \u2013 without words \u2013 that we needed to get Howie evaluated by a professional. And I remember crying the \u201cugly cry\u201d the whole ride home from that Back to School night one year ago, knowing in my heart that she was right but not knowing what it all meant or even what to do next. That night set in motion a chain of events that would change our family forever.  There was the initial appointment with our pediatrician who told us that she didn\u2019t think Howie was on the spectrum, but that he had some \u201cspectrum-like tendencies\u201d.  There was the speech/language assessment and the hearing test to rule out anything physical as the reason why Howie couldn\u2019t process two-step directions.  There was the piles of paperwork as we tried to get him on every wait list possible for an evaluation, and the call three months later for a appointment with a developmental pediatrician.  Then the diagnosis that we expected but still didn\u2019t understand \u2013 autism spectrum disorder. From there, much is a blur.  The diagnosis allowed us to reconvene our special education team and develop Howie\u2019s IEP.  He was assigned ABA techs to work with him one-on-one in and out of the classroom.  He had OT visits, social speech groups, and home visits.  The school tailor made a program to fit his needs.  I got PECS cards, visual schedules, and daily log sheets of his activities.  I learned words like \u201cstimming\u201d, \u201cperseverate\u201d, and \u201csensory diet\u201d.  We gave Howie our undivided attention and divided our attention with our other two boys.  We bought books, weighted blankets and therapy equipment.  We learned behavior modification techniques and used phrases like \u201cred choices\u201d and \u201cgreen choices\u201d.  We worked closely with the amazing school staff and that incredible teacher to do whatever we could to give Howie a chance at loving school and succeeding in life. And\u2026 What a difference a year makes. I walked into his new full day inclusion classroom tonight with a smile on my face.  My husband and I had met with his teachers last week and I already knew things were going well.  He has two incredible ABA techs that really understand him.  They are giving him the choice of starting his day in the OT room to help \u201cget the wiggles out\u201d. Let me say that again \u2013 they are giving  HIM  the choice.  Which means he has reached a point  in one year  where he is able to verbalize his sensory needs.  My little guy, who one year ago couldn\u2019t leave school without a total and complete meltdown, now understands his body enough to know what he needs.  My little guy, who one year ago couldn\u2019t lose a game or draw a picture without a complete on-the-floor tantrum, is now running races on the playground and bringing home pictures that he wants hung up in my husband\u2019s office.  Of course, this is all with his amazing teachers by his side, cheering him on.  But still\u2026after this incredibly hard year, filled with anxiety and confusion and tears and difficult work\u2026maybe we\u2019re finally getting somewhere.  Maybe we\u2019re finally understanding our son. I sat through the entire curriculum presentation tonight feeling \u2013 for the first time in a year \u2013 that my son could do it.  I looked around at the walls and he actually had artwork up for display.  Every one of his teachers came up to me and told me how much they enjoyed having him in class.  Every one of them told me how amazed they were at how well his was doing and what a difference it was, even from just summer school.  One of his techs actually told me that Howie\u2019s \u201cthe reason I love my job.\u201d What a difference a year makes. And now, maybe there\u2019s hope for kindergarten back to school night next year. \u201c Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes \nFive hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear \nFive hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes \nHow do you measure, measure a year?\u201d  -Seasons of Love from RENT In daylights, in sunsets \nIn midnights, in cups of coffee \nIn inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife \nIn five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes \nHow do you measure, a year in the life ?\u201d \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/06/06/teach-your-children-well/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/09/20/seasons-of-love/", "title": "\n\t\t\tSeasons of Love\t\t"},
{"date": "June 16, 2010", "body": "I have a friend who loves summer vacation.\u00a0 She loves when her kids are home, and they have no place to be and no schedules to follow.\u00a0 She loves to just kick back in the yard, sit in the sun, and watch her kid run around. That\u2019s not me. Truth is, summer terrifies me. I can\u2019t remember when that started.\u00a0 Maybe it was the summer when we moved here \u2013 Howie was 4 months old, Gerry was 4 years old and we didn\u2019t know anyone.\u00a0 Howie was a tough baby, and would only sleep on me, wouldn\u2019t take a bottle and cried a lot.\u00a0 We were pretty much trapped in the house and didn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0 Trips to the park were tough because I couldn\u2019t watch Gerry and take care of Howie\u2019s needs too.\u00a0 That got harder as Howie got older, and I tried hard to find things to do ahead of time for Gerry so he wasn\u2019t stuck with us.\u00a0 He did camp after camp after camp until he was finally so burnt out on activities he wouldn\u2019t leave the house.\u00a0 Last summer was the hardest by far \u2013 with a 9 month old Lewis and his naps thrown in the mix of the chaos, I was desperate for school to start again in September. But something about this summer makes me more nervous.\u00a0 Howie has done such an amazing transformation through his school routine.\u00a0 His transition tantrums are less, he\u2019s completely toilet trained (yea!!), and he has learned very good coping strategies for dealing with his sensory issues.\u00a0 Of course, that is with a very scripted school schedule, a one-on-one aide, and OT and special education supports all day long.\u00a0 On school days, I just had to fill in the gaps \u2013 time before school and the few hours afterwards until bedtime.\u00a0 Now that\u2019s all gone.\u00a0 Add in Gerry home and wanting to do his things, and Lewis at the age when he refuses to just sit in a stroller at the park while I chase Howie everywhere, plus needing to be home between noon and two everyday for Lewis\u2019 naps\u2026I\u2019m going crazy just thinking about it. Howie\u2019s only been home for one morning so far and has already needed four sensory breaks, been through 5 cups of juice (his calming mechanism), asked for 15 hugs and spent some time in his body sock.\u00a0 This is after already going to the supermarket and playing kickball outside with Tim before he left for work.\u00a0 It\u2019s not even noon. I\u2019ve seen other people\u2019s blogs where they\u2019ve talked about their completely scripted summer days to help their child make it through each moment.\u00a0 We talked with Howie\u2019s teachers and they agreed that as much routine and scheduling as we can do would be beneficial, so when he starts to spiral out of control we can bring him back to the picture schedule and show him what is coming next.\u00a0 I know he needs that predictability, that understanding of what is happening so he can regulate himself. But it\u2019s not me.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not my life with my three boys.\u00a0 Life is going to get in the way.\u00a0 Lewis may need a nap earlier because he was up all night (like last night) and our entire plan may need to change.\u00a0 Playdates, rain, extreme heat \u2013 all will change our plans. I will try to set up a daily schedule and leave some flexibility for plan changes.\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to think of at least one thing to do each day to get us out \u2013 today supermarket, tomorrow Target for diapers.\u00a0 I\u2019ve hired a mother\u2019s helper to come be with just him for an hour or two twice a week, and summer school starts back in July with a shorten version of the school schedule.\u00a0 And I will hope for the best.

Howie is our middle little guy.\u00a0 He has huge brown eyes that light up when he\u2019s excited, and they sparkle when he laughs.\u00a0 He\u2019s loving and full of energy. I could call him our \u201cspirited\u201d one, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s an appropriate characterization.\u00a0 There\u2019s always been something about him, even as a baby.\u00a0 He was a late talker and walker and had a difficult time adjusting to, well, life.\u00a0 He was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and sensory processing disorder at age 3 1/2.\u00a0 Hearing that there\u2019s something a little different about your kid wasn\u2019t easy, but in many ways it was a relief.\u00a0 So many of his behaviors were finally explained, and it helped to know that there was a neurological reason behind his issues.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m lucky to have grown up in a house with you and Mom where you taught understanding and tolerance of different learning styles and abilities.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t make the days less challenging, but it gives me the strength to get through the hardest moments.\u00a0 I know you would be impressed by his knowledge of Hot Wheels cars and his fiercely strong connection to the people he loves and trusts. Lewis is our baby, although he\u2019s quickly approaching Howie in weight, height and strength.\u00a0 He has an incredible belly laugh and these terrific curls.\u00a0 He clearly takes after our side of the family in his love of food and table manners \u2013 there\u2019s rarely a meal when I am not picking something off of his shirt or out of his hair (but of course, the same can be said of me).\u00a0 While he isn\u2019t talking as much as we\u2019d like at this point, he loves music and sings and dances along with everything from \u201cOld McDonald\u201d to \u201cGolddigger\u201d. He\u2019s incredibly curious\u00a0 and has already developed a great sense of humor.\u00a0 I think you\u2019d be impressed by his comedic timing, and he\u2019d have you \u201ceye-squishing\u201d with his silly faces and games. And then of course, there\u2019s my husband Tim.\u00a0 I will be forever thankful that you met him before you got sick, and I\u2019m so glad that he had a chance to know you.\u00a0 When Tim and I married 9 years ago, it was a sense of comfort to me that he understood me and and how important my family was.\u00a0 Over these years he has become an amazing life partner, and an even more incredible father.\u00a0 His bond with Gerry goes deep \u2013 they enjoy the same love of science and thirst for knowledge, and every evening in the spring they are out in the yard having a catch.\u00a0 With Howie, he shows patience in situations when I can\u2019t and has gone the extra mile to learn whatever he can about ASD so he (and I) can be a better parent.\u00a0 He has looked for ways to connect with Howie and\u00a0 have bonded over a love of cars. And he has some strong connection with Lewis : Tim is in charge of his bedtime \u2013 reading stories, singing songs, and got him to sleep in his crib earlier than any of our other kids ever had.\u00a0 There\u2019s is no doubt that you would have been impressed by his commitment to his kids and to me.\u00a0 While you probably would have disagreed on almost everything else, this dedication to his family would have been your common ground. So while I had to step out of your shadow in the world of politics, you can see that I really did follow in your footsteps.\u00a0 I have created an incredible family, and am raising my children to be good to each other and the world around them.\u00a0 I have learned through necessity to be fierce advocates for them \u2013 as you were for us.\u00a0 My experience with Howie\u2019s issues have taught me to be the voice for those who can\u2019t speak, just as you were in your public political life.\u00a0 Where that might lead me in the future, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 But I do know that I have an incredible path set out for me to follow, thanks to you. Happy Father\u2019s Day to my amazing husband and all the other fathers, fathers-to-be and fathers-that-should-be. \u201c It\u2019s not time to make a change, \nJust relax, take it easy. \nYou\u2019re still young, that\u2019s your fault, \nThere\u2019s so much you have to know. \nFind a girl, settle down, \nIf you want you can marry. \nLook at me, I am old, but I\u2019m happy. \u201d \u2013 Father and Son by Cat Stevens \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/meanddad.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/06/20/father-and%c2%a0son/", "title": "\n\t\t\tFather and\u00a0Son\t\t"},
{"date": "June 29, 2010", "body": "The scene: Two days after school has ended. It is hot and humid outside \u2013 too hot to be out.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost 10 am, and the kids have all been up for 4 hours already (you know, because there\u2019s no school).\u00a0 Hot Wheels cars and trucks cover every room in the house, making it almost impossible to make coffee without tripping. Howie is in full blown out of control mode, running laps in the house and smashing himself into me and anything else he can find.\u00a0 Lewis is moaning like Chewbacca, doing his best to get my attention as he takes everything out of the pantry cabinet searching for something he can open himself.\u00a0 Gerry is overloaded with the noise already, on the verge of tears because there\u2019s no quiet in the house at all.\u00a0\u00a0 A diaper change becomes an impossible task, as Lewis wiggles and Howie hangs on me crying for a hug and Gerry stomps up the stairs.\u00a0 Just as I\u2019m about to reach for the can of chocolate frosting I\u2019ve hidden away for just such an occasion\u2026 a knock at the door. And in walks Mrs. L. Mrs. L is an occupational therapist, good friends with Howie\u2019s school OT.\u00a0 When I talked with his school OT about at-home services, she told me that her friend may be able to help.\u00a0 She works in a nearby school system, but has extensive experience with kids with sensory issues like Howie.\u00a0 I contacted her a few days before school ended, and asked if she\u2019d be able to come out to the house and observe like \u201cSupernanny\u201d does, sit on the side, see how we all interact, then let me know what we need.\u00a0 Thankfully, she agreed. I had worried that she\u2019d come on a day when everything was running smoothly, like those days when you bring your car into the mechanic after weeks of it making a funny sound, and then on that day the car runs fine.\u00a0 But no, on that day our house was in full chaos.\u00a0 Mrs. L walked in to a sensory firestorm.\u00a0 And didn\u2019t seemed bothered by it at all. We sat at the table, and while Lewis climbed into her lap to draw on all her notes, we talked about Howie and all his issues.\u00a0 I had sent her a copy of his IEP, his OT reports and evaluations, his PDD-NOS diagnosis, and his early intervention notes so she knew all about his background.\u00a0 She was impressed by what he had had so far, and reassured me that we were on the right path.\u00a0 She talked to me while Howie was making noises and bouncing off the walls.\u00a0 The dog was barking incessantly upstairs.\u00a0 Gerry was playing a video game that I had asked him to turn off 10 minutes earlier.\u00a0 I was trying hard to focus on everything she was saying while filtering out the craziness around me.\u00a0\u00a0 Mrs. L stopped talking, looked right at me and said \u201cThree boys and a dog, eh?\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot to handle.\u201d While that was clearly the understatement of the day, it was also our instant connection.\u00a0 She understood me.\u00a0 She knew that I couldn\u2019t put in hours and hours of clinic therapy time.\u00a0 She knew that I was going to have problems keeping a busy and consistent routine for Howie, because I had other competing interests in the house.\u00a0 She knew that I was all at once overwhelmed and underachieving, a combination that leads to the type of morning we were having right at that moment. Mrs. L broke it all down for me.\u00a0 She said she treats kids with sensory issues like they are a bank.\u00a0 We need to make sensory \u201cdeposits\u201d in their bodies in order for them to get through the day without meltdowns and transition problems.\u00a0 She asked me if we\u2019d ever been to a birthday party on one day when things went smoothly, and then another party a week later when things fell apart.\u00a0 The key, she said, was to examine what happened up to that party \u2013 on the smooth day, we had a good night sleep, lots of sensory input through play, a good lunch, and a calm ride all equal the ability to draw on the sensory \u201cdeposit\u201d and get through the party.\u00a0 Throw in a tough night sleep, a change in routine, no lunch, and rushing around and this will deplete deposits and limit the ability to function at the other party.\u00a0 It made total sense of course.\u00a0 We all get a little \u201coff\u201d when days don\u2019t go smoothly, but for kids with sensory processing disorder not having that reserve to pull from will make the rest of the day impossible to get back on track. We talked about ways to build up those reserves everyday.\u00a0 Get him swinging high on the swings every morning for 15-20 minutes outside.\u00a0 If the weather\u2019s bad, create an inside obstacle course that has both controlled body movements (stepping over a tower of blocks) and squishy input (jumping into a bean bag chair, then pretending to swim under it).\u00a0 She set up a course in the house, and as she had Howie move through it, she explained what each part was doing for him.\u00a0 She also suggested expanding our picture schedule, getting Howie involved in planning it that morning so he knew what was happening.\u00a0 We created an \u201coops\u201d card to use when the schedule changes. Then she did something no one had done before.\u00a0 She saw Gerry sitting there, desperately trying to figure out his place in all this.\u00a0 Mrs. L pulled him aside and explained to him what we were doing.\u00a0 She told him that Howie\u2019s engine runs very high, and unlike him and most of us, he can\u2019t slow it down on his own.\u00a0 We need to teach him how to slow it down, and the obstacle course or the swings were ways to do that.\u00a0 She told him that once he learns how to do these things, he will be much calmer and quieter, which helps us all.\u00a0 Mrs. L\u00a0 asked Gerry if he would help plan the next course.\u00a0 All of a sudden, Gerry had a role in this.\u00a0 His attitude changed, and he asked what he could do to be more helpful.\u00a0 I looked at Mrs. L with tears in my eyes and mouthed \u201cThank you\u201d. Mrs. L offered to come back again if wanted, but she didn\u2019t think we needed consistent therapy if we implemented a few of these things.\u00a0 She told me to hold off on clinic work for now, and reminded me that\u00a0 we just needed to tweak what we had.\u00a0 With that, she said goodbye to the kids, the dog, and gave me a hug telling me to call whenever I wanted. I closed the door with a sigh of relief.\u00a0 With her virtual \u201cspotlight\u201d, Mrs. L had pinpointed our most pressing problems, and guided us with a light to the solutions. And for now, the can of chocolate frosting is still in the cabinet. \u201cAnd I feel \nQuicker than a ray of light \nThen gone for \nSomeone else shall be there \nThrough the endless years\u201d  \u2013 Ray of Light by Madonna \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/06/29/ray-of-light/", "title": "\n\t\t\tRay of Light\t\t"},

I had to turn around at this moment to bite my lip.\u00a0 As parents, we all think to the future, wondering what kind of people our kids will become and what great things they will do in their lives. \u00a0 But if you had asked me six months ago if I could have envisioned Howie becoming a race car driver \u2013 a kid who had a hard time with the loud noises at the Monster Truck races at age 2 \u2013 I would have said no way.\u00a0 And if you had asked me three months ago if I could have imagined that Gerry and Howie would be having a conversation about their future lives, I would have laughed, considering this kind of back and forth social discussion was foreign to Howie. This ever-so-simple exchange between two brothers was an indication of just how far Howie had come with all his hard work.\u00a0 It was a reminder to me that I needed to focus on all his accomplishments in this short amount of time, and not dwell on the tough work\u00a0 that still needed to be done.\u00a0 In his mind, there was no reason why he couldn\u2019t be a race car driver when he was older.\u00a0 With the right help and supports, he could be that and so much more. I turned back around and complimented them both on their excellent future career choices.\u00a0 If you\u2019re looking for me in 15 years, you can find me splitting my time between Fenway Park and the speedway in Loudon, NH. \u201cMamas don\u2019t let your babies grow up to be cowboys. \n\u2018Cos they\u2019ll never stay home and they\u2019re always alone. \nEven with someone they love.\u201d \u2013 Waylon Jennings \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/05/18/mammas-dont-let-your-babies-grow-up-to-be-cowboys/", "title": "\n\t\t\tMammas Don\u2019t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be\u00a0Cowboys\t\t"},
{"date": "July 10, 2010", "body": "We just got back from the happiest place on Earth. No, not Disney. Disneyworld (or Disneyland for that matter) is just not feasible for my family, logistically or financially.\u00a0 Flying with the five of us, and our kids at all different ages and stages, is just incredibly difficult right now, not to mention very expensive.\u00a0 Add in admission to the park, hotel, finding food for my vegan husband and corn-free Howie\u2026Disney is just out of our realm right now.\u00a0 Plus Tim hates to travel.\u00a0 So for the sake of our sanity and our checking account, we keep our travels to car trips. So for us, our \u201cDisney\u201d is  Storyland , in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.\u00a0 And for my three guys, this place is heaven on earth. This was our sixth year at the park.\u00a0 We first went with Gerry when he turned three (and it was just him) and we\u2019ve gone back every summer around his birthday ever since.\u00a0 The park has been in existence for over 55 years, and Tim\u2019s mother remembers taking him when he was a little kid.\u00a0 The park has evolved over the years, of course, but the overall point remains the same \u2013 giving kids between the ages of 1-10 and their parents a fun, safe place to have a fantastic family vacation.\u00a0 For my guys, it\u2019s the one family vacation spot we go.\u00a0 Howie talks about it ALL year long, and asks starting in December if it\u2019s time to go back to Storyland. There are many things that make this park special for a lot of families.\u00a0 For us, with all of our \u201cspecial needs\u201d, this park is perfect.\u00a0 First of all, almost all the rides are for kids 36 inches and under.\u00a0 That means there\u2019s no \u201csorry, you can\u2019t go on that very cool looking rollercoaster\u201d, or \u201cI know that Crazy Barn looks really awesome, but you\u2019re too small\u201d talk.\u00a0 There\u2019s very little saying \u201cNo\u201d.\u00a0 My kids get to choose the rides they want to go on, not have the park choose it for them.\u00a0 Even the baby got to do a bunch of rides, which thrilled him to no end.\u00a0\u00a0 Parents can also fit on all the rides with their kids, so it\u2019s truly a family event. Not to say there aren\u2019t plenty of meltdowns.\u00a0 But they seem to happen around 2pm at the front of the park at nap time.\u00a0 Or in my family, when it\u2019s time to leave. Secondly, the park is relatively small and feels very safe.\u00a0 Because the rides are geared towards the younger set, there are no teenagers or grownups trying to muscle their way on any of the rides\u00a0 (nothing against teenagers or grownups, but when I\u2019m with my little kids I don\u2019t want to worry about someone bouncing the ride to make it crazier, or swearing, or causing a ruckus).\u00a0 Everyone there seems to be either a parent, a grandparent or some relative, oohing or ahhing over seeing Cinderella, waving to the train as it goes by, or sharing an ice cream with their kid.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure they have had issues in the past with safety, but you wouldn\u2019t know it.\u00a0 There are no security guards or policemen walking around.\u00a0 Just Mother Goose and the Old Lady Who Lived in a Shoe. It\u2019s the most family friendly place I\u2019ve ever been.\u00a0 They have special \u201cMama\u2019s Houses\u201d for moms to feed, change and nap their babies, complete with rocking chairs and clean changing tables.\u00a0 Every restroom has at least one unisex family bathroom, so we can all go in together.\u00a0 The rides are clean and all the ride operators are incredibly friendly.\u00a0 We try to go at off-peak times, so we\u2019ve never waited on a line for more than 10 minutes.\u00a0 If the line is long at one place, we move on and come back at another time. Thirdly, and most helpful to me, they list all their food choices and ingredients (color coded by allergen) on their website.\u00a0 That means before we even enter the park I have a list of foods that both Tim and Howie can eat.\u00a0 Yes, that list is short (for Howie it was five foods that were corn-free) but at least I know those foods so I\u2019m not checking labels.\u00a0 You can also bring in your own food to the park, which is a life saver (and money saver) for my family.\u00a0 Our lunch consisted of yogurt smoothies, goldfish and apples that I brought from home.\u00a0 And they don\u2019t care. And finally, for us, it\u2019s the one place where all of my kids\u2019 needs are met.\u00a0 Lewis can go on rides, throw balls with reckless abandon in their \u201cLoopy Lab\u201d, and run through the park from place to place.\u00a0 Howie can map out his entire day based on all the rides he wants to go on and run/climb/jump and get all his sensory inputs without feeling overwhelmed.\u00a0 Gerry can do all the rides by himself now, and we save special rides just for him and Tim to do while Lewis, Howie and I ride the train around the park (over and over and over again).\u00a0 I must say, Gerry was truly the hero of the day.\u00a0 He went on rides with both Lewis and Howie, even the ones he didn\u2019t want to.\u00a0 He rode alone on certain ones because Tim and I were in a seat with one of the other two.\u00a0 And he let Howie go ahead of him in line \u2013 twice \u2013 when the purple electric car was coming and Howie was screaming that he needed to ride in that specific car.\u00a0 Tim and I are, for the most part, worry-free.\u00a0 Our kids smiles make all the difference. Not that the trip was perfect.\u00a0 Things were certainly more stressful now that we have a toddler \u2013 the car ride was hard because Lewis was trying to nap but Howie kept shouting/making noise/asking for hugs/stopping to pee.\u00a0 Lewis also did his best to set a new world record in hotel room destruction.\u00a0 And it was hot.\u00a0 Very hot.\u00a0 But we still managed to go swimming, take pictures, and enjoy each other\u2019s company \u2013 the three most important components to a successful family vacation. Howie\u2019s already planning our next trip back. \u201c There is this little song I wrote \nI hope you learn it note for note \nLike good little children \nDon\u2019t worry, be happy\u201d  \u2013 Don\u2019t Worry, Be Happy by Bobby McFerrin  \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.storylandnh.com/index.html"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/07/10/dont-worry-be-happy/", "title": "\n\t\t\tDon\u2019t Worry,\u00a0Be\u00a0Happy\t\t"},
{"date": "May 20, 2010", "body": "I had an interesting conversation this afternoon with Gerry.\u00a0 He\u2019s my oldest, and at \u201calmost eight years old\u201d he is wise and emotional beyond his years.\u00a0 Today, he was already in a mood when he came home from school, and 15 minutes later he was sitting in front of me with tears in his eyes.\u00a0 After a few minutes of quiet sobbing and my prodding, he held his hand out to show me what was causing him such pain. A broken Silly Band. That\u2019s right, a Silly Band.\u00a0 Since I had prohibited him from taking them to school, he came home and ran right up to his room to figure out which ones he wanted to trade with his friends later.\u00a0 And he broke one.\u00a0 A purple baseball mitt.\u00a0 This tiny 30 cent rubber band was causing all the angst. It\u2019s moments like these when you know as a parent you can say one of two things \u2013 what you really want to say, and what you really should say.\u00a0 What I really wanted to say was \u201cAre you kidding?\u00a0 It\u2019s a rubber band!\u00a0 And you have 70 more upstairs just like it!\u201d. But of course, that\u2019s not what I said.\u00a0 I told him I was sorry it broke, I knew it was special to him, but we should focus on the fact that he still had many more to trade and we could replace this one if we needed to.\u00a0 I told him we could look at it as if the glass was \u201chalf full\u201d and not \u201chalf empty\u201d. I could tell that this expression, while new to him, was intriguing, since he had just started studying fractions at school.\u00a0 I explained to him that it meant we could think about the situation one of two ways \u2013 focusing on the negative part that one of his Silly Bands was broken, or we could look at the bright side, which was there was a whole bag full of them still upstairs, and I bet we could find another special one in there to trade. I realized as I was saying these words to him that it was good advice for my own daily life.\u00a0 So many days I only see the downside of things \u2013 the tantrums, the difficulties dealing with Howie\u2019s behavior, the physical and mental exhaustion that ends every day.\u00a0 When you\u2019re stuck in the muck of the minute-to-minute struggles of parenthood, it\u2019s hard to step outside your own head and see how good things are.\u00a0 We have three amazing young boys who make us laugh everyday.\u00a0 They are happy and healthy and enjoy being together (well, as much as three brothers can).\u00a0 Our kids are well liked and other kids (and their parents) want to be their friends.\u00a0 When looking at the big picture, I can\u2019t really ask for more than that. I looked at Gerry and he was already getting a smile on his face.\u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d he said, \u201cMaybe I can trade the broken one for free like my friend did when  his  Silly Band broke!\u201d\u00a0 He ran upstairs to put the broken one back in the bag with the other 70 ones. I turned my attention back to Howie and Lewis.\u00a0 They were taking turns driving Hot Wheels cars down a track that the kids had put together earlier.\u00a0 All three kids were happy and content at the same time.\u00a0 For a brief moment, this glass was all the way full. \u201c Some things in life are bad\u2026They can really make you mad\u2026Other things just make you swear and curse.

{"date": "May 24, 2010", "body": "Dear They Might Be Giants, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for a terrific concert this weekend in Arlington, Massachusetts.\u00a0 We drove in with all three boys to see your show, and to be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard for us to take all of our boys anywhere, and this was our first concert together.\u00a0 But we love your music, so we thought we\u2019d give it a try. At first, things didn\u2019t go all that smoothly.\u00a0 We waited outside in line for about a half hour, about 20 minutes longer than I had anticipated.\u00a0 We were in the shade for the most part, so it wasn\u2019t all that bad.\u00a0 I thought we were doomed though when we went into the theater box office to get our tickets, and Howie started to gag from the mix of the popcorn and people smell.\u00a0 All those bodies and all those food smells are usually the \u201ckiss of death\u201d for him, so I thought we were leaving right then and there. See, my 4 year old son has sensory processing disorder.\u00a0 This means that he has trouble regulating his \u201csensory input\u201d.\u00a0 He\u2019s overly sensitive to the world around him \u2013 smells, sounds, noises, crowds\u2026all these things come bombarding at him all at once, and his body and brain have trouble making sense of it all.\u00a0 Sometimes his behavior spirals out of control.\u00a0 Sometimes he retreats into my arms.\u00a0 Sometimes both.\u00a0 Taking him to a concert with live music was really bringing him out of his comfort zone.\u00a0 Add this to the concert starting right at Lewis\u2019 nap time, and I was beginning to think I should file this trip under \u201cWhat was I thinking?\u201d Once inside, we were lucky enough to find four seats together in the back row by the aisle.\u00a0 We know most people shy away from this spot, but it was perfect for us.\u00a0 We could see but it wasn\u2019t too close for the lights to be too bright.\u00a0 We could hear, but it wasn\u2019t too loud.\u00a0 And most importantly, we could get up and leave easily if needed. But, They Might Be Giants, you did an amazing job of knowing your audience and planning your show accordingly.\u00a0 You kept the lights on in the theater so the kids could see each other and their parents.\u00a0 There were no sudden loud noises or explosions (well, except for the confetti machine, but we were far enough back that we were able to enjoy it without getting scared).\u00a0 You kept the banter between songs to a minimum, and played familiar songs from all your kids\u2019 albums so that we could constantly remind our son \u201cHey!\u00a0 We know this song!\u201d.\u00a0 And you even threw us a parents a couple of songs too from the old days (thank you for Istanbul- one of my favs!)\u00a0 My oldest son was singing along to all his favorites from \u201cHere Comes Science\u201d.\u00a0 Your album re-ignited his love for science, and he\u2019s telling grownups about the periodic table and how the sun is made of gases.\u00a0 My youngest fell asleep (no offense, but he\u2019s the third child and it was nap time). And after an hour on my lap, Howie got down, walked over to the railing next to our seats, and proceeded to pretend to play the bongos along with \u201cParticle Man\u201d and \u201cAlphabet of Nations\u201d.\u00a0 He was dancing and singing and moving to the music.\u00a0 It was truly a remarkable experience for me and for our family, seeing him up like that.\u00a0 On our way out the door after your encore, Howie turned to me and said \u201cThat was GREAT!!\u201d. It was more than great.\u00a0 It was amazing.\u00a0 So thank you They Might Be Giants.\u00a0 You allowed our family to have a wonderful experience together, and showed us that it\u2019s ok to push ourselves out of our comfort zone.\u00a0 Thank you for giving us the ability to enjoy live music as a family again.

{"date": "July 5, 2010", "body": "I\u2019m a pretty private person. I know that seems weird to say, considering I write this blog now, but in the non-virtual world I\u2019m pretty good at keeping things about me to myself, only sharing with close family and a few select friends. This need for privacy is certainly something I learned from my parents, and especially my father.\u00a0 Despite his very public political life, our family life was kept behind closed doors.\u00a0 Nothing illustrated this more than when he got sick with pancreatic cancer.\u00a0 Inside our house, we were a mess, scrambling to get him whatever help we could while attempting to understand what his absence would mean.\u00a0 Outside our house, however, we all circled the wagons at my father\u2019s insistence.\u00a0 When asked how he was doing, our family mantra became \u201cYup, yup, we\u2019re doing ok.\u201d But we weren\u2019t doing ok.\u00a0 By denying this fact to the rest of the world \u2013 specifically our friends and neighbors \u2013 we were denying ourselves the ability to get outside help and support.\u00a0 We closed ourselves off from the shoulders to cry on, the hands to hold when things were rough, or the understanding voice on the other end of the phone saying that they had been there too. Fast forward to last year when we started to really notice that things were a little different with Howie.\u00a0 As I\u2019ve said before we knew for a while that something was going on with him, but when he started preschool we could really see that he needed help.\u00a0 My privacy instincts kicked in immediately, and while we were waiting to get him evaluated I kept our whole story to myself, with the exception again of a few family members and close friends.\u00a0 Living in a small town, it would be easy for one person to innocently share with one friend what we were going through, and then that friend would tell another, until the game of \u201cTelephone\u201d had been played to the point that Howie\u2019s story would become something not even close to the truth.\u00a0 I was already uncomfortable enough with the accommodations we had made to his schedule (increasing his school time from three to five mornings, having him enter school before the other kids, picking him up at a different door) \u2013 I didn\u2019t need everyone in town questioning why we were getting seemingly special treatment. Once we got Howie\u2019s PDD-NOS diagnosis, however, I knew in my heart it was time to let it out.\u00a0 Educationally, we didn\u2019t really have a choice.\u00a0 His autism diagnosis led us to a full day/full year preschool program and the need for an IEP.\u00a0 We were now entering the school through a different door and picking up at a different time \u2013 clearly something noticed by all the parents who we had previously waited with before school started. I first let down my guard with three other mothers who were dropping off their kids for the full day special program.\u00a0 Introducing myself to them was not easy for me, but they were so warm and welcoming and understanding it was hard not to think that I should share more.\u00a0 Howie and I attended a gymnastics class in town just for kids on the spectrum and I wrote an essay about it for  Autism Speaks . When it was published on their  website , our story was out. Following that post, Tim and I spent a lot of time talking about how I had \u201couted\u201d Howie to the world as being on the spectrum, without him having a say in it at all.\u00a0  As I\u2019ve written before , we came to the conclusion that this is who he is, and his behavior or quirks or whatever we may call it are explained by his ASD and we didn\u2019t label him for life with something that wasn\u2019t him. But for me it was more than just that.\u00a0 Sharing his story was the only way for  me  to get the help and support  I  needed to get through the day.\u00a0 It was the only way I could feel that I was not alone.\u00a0 Sharing led me to three new wonderful friends, to starting our local support group, and of course, to writing this blog. I am still figuring out when to break through that wall of privacy around me.\u00a0 I have a constant debate in my head when we meet new people about how much to share with them.\u00a0 Do I tell the mom at the park when she\u2019s staring at Howie when he\u2019s making his noises?\u00a0 The neighbor who calls to ask about a playdate?\u00a0 The swim instructor who can\u2019t understand why Howie won\u2019t put his feet down on the dock?  Considering the stigma that is still attached to the word \u201cautism\u201d, I don\u2019t want him shunned from playgroups or activities, yet I want others to know why he behaves the way he does. When asked by casual acquaintances and extended family members how things are going, I still find myself answering \u201cyup, yup, we\u2019re doing ok\u201d, even when we\u2019re not.\u00a0 But I\u2019m getting there.\u00a0 Because I know that the more I share what\u2019s going on in our house, the more others will understand Howie and spectrum disorders in general.\u00a0 And because I know  I  need those shoulders to cry on and those understanding voices telling me that I\u2019m not alone. \u201c It doesn\u2019t matter what they say \nIn the jealous games people play \nOur lips are sealed \nPay no mind to what they say \nIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway \nOur lips are sealed \u201d \u2013 Our Lips are Sealed by The Go-Go\u2019s \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/01/18/welcome-to-the-community/", "http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/01/22/in-their-own-words-welcome-to-the-community/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/reading-labels/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/our-lips-are-sealed/", "title": "\n\t\t\tOur Lips Are\u00a0Sealed\t\t"},

Yes, that\u2019s right.\u00a0 This weekend I\u2019m going to New York City to see the cast of \u201cGlee\u201d perform at Radio City Music Hall.\u00a0 Jealous?\u00a0 I thought so. People who know me know how much I love music and musicals especially.\u00a0 I grew up listening to the soundtracks from such Broadway plays as \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d, \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d, and \u201cGrease\u201d.\u00a0 I could sing every line from every song and act out every scene from each play.\u00a0 There\u2019s something about a musical that just sucks me in \u2013 the incredible ability to use music to tell a story and send a message home.\u00a0\u00a0 I think that\u2019s why the show \u201cGlee\u201d has really struck a chord with me (no pun intended). This trip to New York City marks the first time I\u2019m leaving all three boys for longer than 2 hours.\u00a0 My friend and I are taking the train there in the morning, going to the concert, and then taking the train back up again that night.\u00a0 In total, I will be gone about 19 hours.\u00a0 I\u2019ve asked my mother to come down to help out for the day, not because I don\u2019t think Tim can handle being alone with the boys, but I know how nice it is to have an extra pair of hands around.\u00a0 Having her come visit was more for my piece of mind \u2013\u00a0 knowing that another person is there in case something happens just makes me feel better about being gone for the day. I\u2019ve been spending the past few days doing laundry, grocery shopping, and making lists for Tim and my mom about the day.\u00a0 When you have a kid like Howie, keeping a routine is so important.\u00a0 I need them to know what to do when he gets upset and is looking for me for a hug.\u00a0 I need them to look for signs that he needs a break, or a snack, or some exercise.\u00a0 I want to make sure I have the right foods in the house for them, pajamas all laid out \u2013 anything I can do to make it easier for those 19 hours. It\u2019s all so I can enjoy myself without worrying that things are a mess at home.\u00a0 This trip is a treat for me \u2013 those 19 hours are all MINE.\u00a0 I need time to be without the kids, and the kids need time to be without me.\u00a0 I need to be able to be\u2026 just\u00a0 me and not Mom.\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to eat  when  I want, eat  what  I want, and go to the bathroom alone.\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to sit in the balcony of Radio City Music Hall and sing my heart out along with Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, and the other cast members from the show.\u00a0 And, after those 19 hours,\u00a0 I\u2019ll be ready to get home refreshed and be a better mom to my kids (with a little Glee in my heart).

{"date": "June 1, 2010", "body": "I am sitting here, report in hand, reviewing the results of Lewis\u2019 evaluation from\u00a0 Early Intervention.\u00a0 I\u2019m having that strange sense of Deja Vu \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t feel good. We\u2019ve had concerns about his speech (or lack there-of) for a few months now, concerns that I expressed at both his 15 month and his 18th month well checks with our pediatrician.\u00a0 At his 15 month check, I told our doctor (who I love) that I was worried that his language wasn\u2019t progressing.\u00a0 He had some sounds, a few partial words, and \u201cDada\u201d (which, for the record, I do not take personally, although it would it have been so hard for one of my kids\u2019 first real word be MAMMA???)\u00a0 I told her that it was really hard for me to know what was \u201cnormal\u201d anymore, since Gerry talked so early and never stopped, and even Howie had some words and sounds at this point.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t worried about his hearing since he followed directions just fine, responded to his name and clearly understood a lot more than we thought he did.\u00a0 And I wasn\u2019t worried about any of his gross or fine motor skills.\u00a0 At that appointment, she told me to just wait, let\u2019s see how it progresses and we\u2019ll check again at 18 months.\u00a0 Those three months passed by painfully quiet, and at the 18 month appointment she handed me Early Intervention\u2019s number.\u00a0 To misquote Ronald Reagan, I thought \u201cHere we go again.\u201d The Early Intervention team came out on the day that Lewis turned 19 months, and did the Michigan Early Intervention Developmental Profile with him, a test that takes about an hour to complete.\u00a0 The profile covers everything \u2013 fine motor, gross motor, social/emotional interactions, both receptive and expressive language, and a section on self-care.\u00a0 Again, I had this weird sense of having been here before.\u00a0 Exactly two years earlier we were running these same tests with Howie, but with much different answers.\u00a0 Almost every question they asked me, I answered almost the opposite of what I had answered two years prior.\u00a0 Is he able to play away from you for more than 5 minutes?\u00a0 Yes. (but not Howie)\u00a0 Does he vary his play with different toys?\u00a0 Yes. (but now Howie \u2013 not even now.)\u00a0 Can he find an object when hidden from view? Yes. (again, not Howie).\u00a0 Can he eat with a spoon independently, build a 6 block tower, draw a circle, and follow new instructions exactly?\u00a0 Yes to all (and no to all with Howie, and some he just started doing this year). We finally got to the speech/language part of the Michigan, and I told her that I knew he had some emerging sounds and some beginnings of words, but there wasn\u2019t anything past that.\u00a0 By this time I was having a hard time concentrating.\u00a0 Each question and each task they asked him to perform up to this point was like a slap in the head to me.\u00a0 How did I miss all these things two years ago?\u00a0 Had I been paying better attention, would there have been signs that I needed to push for more services earlier on?\u00a0 And how come no one in Early Intervention said anything to me that would have pushed me to get Howie diagnosed earlier?\u00a0 Here I was again, watching this all unfold in my toy room with Lewis, knowing that siblings of children with ASD are more likely to also be on the spectrum, and I wondered if I had the strength to do it all again. I pulled out every ounce of emotional energy I had to listen to the final part of the testing and hear their preliminary results.\u00a0 Part of me was embarrassed that they were even here, considering how well he was performing on most of the tasks.\u00a0 But the other part of me knew that the speech/language evaluator wasn\u2019t hearing what she wanted to hear from him.\u00a0 She first gave me all his \u201cscores\u201d from the other parts of the tests \u2013 social/emotional level was at a 21 month developmental level, cognition was at 19 months, fine motor \u2013 21 months, gross motor \u2013 19 months, self care level was 16 months (but she told me that the Michigan seems to expect that kids are toilet trained by age 2, so we shouldn\u2019t pay too close attention to this number), and receptive language was at a 23 month developmental level. Then the expressive language.\u00a0 She told me that she was impressed with my grasp on speech/language lingo with my \u201cemerging sounds\u201d classification, and it was clear I knew what was going on.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t hear any polysyllabic sounds from him.\u00a0 He only had a few vowel sounds in his babbling.\u00a0 However, his ability to name one object on request, his use of gestures to communicate, and the fact that he used two words meaningfully scored him at the 15 month level developmentally.\u00a0 In order to be eligible for early intervention services, he needed to have \u201cscored\u201d at the 14 month level.\u00a0 According to the guidelines, he was functioning at a developmentally appropriate level. My heart sank.\u00a0 For most people, this should have been good news.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t so far behind that there was a \u201cproblem\u201d that needed immediate help.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t qualify for services, isn\u2019t that a good thing?\u00a0 But I had been here before, two years earlier.\u00a0 Howie scored \u201cdevelopmentally appropriate\u201d in all areas too, all on the lower end of the guidelines, but he always had one or two strengths in each category that pushed his score into the \u201cnormal\u201d range.\u00a0 The only way we received early intervention services with him was that they picked him up under clinical judgment for his sensory issues, meaning that we know that something is going on but we can\u2019t quite put our finger on it, so we\u2019ll see if OT every other week for six months helps.\u00a0 And I was right there again with Lewis now. I asked the evaluator about picking Lewis up under clinical judgment.\u00a0 Very honestly, she told me that she could, but because it\u2019s only for a six month time period she thought it better to wait three months to see how or if Lewis\u2019 speech improved.\u00a0 She gave me some very concrete suggestions of what to do to encourage his language skills, and told me to call her just before he turned two to come back to redo just the speech portion of the profile. I think she could sense my frustration, because she promised that she would be the one to come back and gave me her cell phone number to call even before the three months if I thought things were regressing or not progressing at all. So, again, we play the wait and see game.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to implement her suggestions and we\u2019re seeing a few improvements.\u00a0 Most of all I have to try not to panic.\u00a0 On the outside, I tell my husband and others that it is what it is, if he doesn\u2019t talk, we\u2019ll just do whatever we have to do to help him.\u00a0 But inside I\u2019m a mess.\u00a0 Wondering if I have the strengths to do this all again.\u00a0 Begging him to just say \u201ccar\u201d.\u00a0 Hoping that this isn\u2019t another case of history repeating itself. \u201c just little bits of history repeating \nand I\u2019ve seen it before \nand I\u2019ll see it again \nyes I\u2019ve seen it before \njust little bits of history repeating \u201d \u2013 The Propellerheads \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/history-repeating/", "title": "\n\t\t\tHistory\u00a0Repeating\t\t"},

There are so many many things I love about you.\u00a0 First and foremost of course, is that you made us parents eight years ago.\u00a0 A life changing event in so many ways, of course, but for me it led me down a path I never thought I\u2019d take.\u00a0 I was working 12 hour days and teaching when you arrived (in fact, I was writing curriculum when I was in labor with you), and had always assumed I go back to work.\u00a0 A few weeks home with you and I knew I couldn\u2019t leave you.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With your growth issues, you needed me.\u00a0 And so home I stayed.\u00a0 Eight years later, here I still am.\u00a0 My \u201cjob\u201d is to now be home with you and your brothers.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t an easy choice, but one I never regret. I see so much of both me and your dad in your looks and your personality.\u00a0 Actually, you look a lot like my dad did when he was your age.\u00a0 You have his athletic ability too, and I love that you enjoy playing baseball as much as he did.\u00a0 Like him, you\u2019re small but quick with excellent skills.\u00a0 And you listen.\u00a0 How great was it that your coach this year said how much he liked having you on the team because you were so \u201ccoachable\u201d.\u00a0 Like my dad, I think you\u2019ve found a sport that you can enjoy for life.\u00a0 I love how you just want to go out and play ball \u2013 even alone \u2013 but it\u2019s so much fun to watch you and your dad have a catch in the yard.\u00a0 I know your dad likes that too.\u00a0 He\u2019s told me about how far you\u2019ve come with your skills and you\u2019re getting better than him!\u00a0 You and you dad are so much alike in many ways \u2013 you are both incredibly smart, articulate beyond your years, and have a curiosity and lust for learning that many adults don\u2019t possess.\u00a0 I like listening to the two of you talk about cars, science, and how the world works.\u00a0 Now if I could only understand half of what you were saying\u2026 I hear time and time again what a \u201cgood kid\u201d you are.\u00a0 Of all of your special qualities, this one is the one that warms my heart.\u00a0 Your teachers have said it, your friends\u2019 parents have said it \u2013 they all enjoy having you around.\u00a0 You\u2019re polite, fun, engaging and easy going (and you don\u2019t eat a lot!)\u00a0 Kids want to be your friend and parents want their kids to be friends with you.\u00a0 That says a whole lot about you as a person.\u00a0 You can\u2019t teach that.\u00a0 That\u2019s just you.\u00a0 And that is truly awesome. But what makes you the most special is that you have become an amazing big brother.\u00a0 Howie looks up to you and trusts you and wants to be just like you.\u00a0 I know in so many ways, it\u2019s quite annoying.\u00a0 I can see how upset you get when he makes his noises instead of words, or throws a fit when things don\u2019t go just right.\u00a0 You\u2019re old enough now to understand that he can\u2019t control those noises or outbursts in the same way that you can.\u00a0 We\u2019ve talked about how his autism affects his daily life, and all of ours.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing our best to help Howie with his coping strategies, but I know sometimes we don\u2019t do enough to help you with yours.\u00a0 Know that I am trying \u2013 I am trying not to yell, trying not to get frustrated by the day.\u00a0 I know I need to find activities that we can all do together so that we can better interact as a family, and not ones that pull us apart and do separately. As Howie gets older, he\u2019s going to look to you for help in his life when he has difficulties or challenges because of his autism.\u00a0 He will do this because of how awesome you are.\u00a0 He will do this because he knows you love him and care about him and you will help keep him safe, just as you already do.\u00a0 That makes you more special than many big brothers, and it\u2019s one of the huge reasons we love you so much. Happy Birthday sweetie.\u00a0 And next year that seat at Fenway next to you is all mine. Love, Mom \u201cWill you laugh just like your mother \nWill you sigh like your old man \nWill some things skip a generation \nLike I\u2019ve heard they often can \nAre you a poet or a dancer \nA devil or a clown \nOr a strange new combination of \nThe things we\u2019ve handed down\u201d \u2013  The Things We\u2019ve Handed Down by Marc Cohn \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/the-things-weve-handed-down/", "title": "\n\t\t\tThe Things We\u2019ve Handed\u00a0Down\t\t"},
{"date": "June 6, 2010", "body": "We found out last week that my son\u2019s favorite teacher won\u2019t be returning\u00a0 for his last year of preschool. But I\u2019m not hitting the panic button. A year ago, I would have been in a total panic.\u00a0 I would have been a wreck, wondering how on earth Howie was going to get through the year without her there.\u00a0 But it\u2019s because of all the amazing work that his teacher has done with him this year that I know things will be just fine. Let me tell you a little bit about Mrs. M.\u00a0 In the interest of full disclosure, she is my neighbor and also my friend.\u00a0 But our interactions with her started even before we moved here 4 years ago, as she not only helped me enroll Gerry in preschool over the summer, but got him into a \u201cCircle Time\u201d camp at the school with his new teacher, so he would feel more comfortable starting at the new school.\u00a0 The kids that Gerry met in that class have became some of his best friends, and three of the mothers that I met at drop off and pickup are still my closest friends four years later.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure I want to think about how different mine and Gerry\u2019s life would have been had we not started at that school when we did. As Howie got older and we started to notice some definite delays in his development, I turned to Mrs. M for advice and help.\u00a0 As a special educator, she had information and resources and perspective.\u00a0 She gave me the words to use with my pediatrician, and was my sounding board after the early intervention evaluation.\u00a0 When the director at the private preschool where I had enrolled Howie when he was 2 1/2 called to say that they wanted to reduce his hours because of his behavior (her words were \u201che doesn\u2019t have any sensory or processing issues, he\u2019s just a badly behaved boy\u201d) Mrs. M listened as I was almost in tears, helping me realize that they were the ones who were wrong, not me.\u00a0 Mrs. M was the team leader for our school district\u2019s CORE evaluation of Howie when he turned three, and even though he was found to be ineligible for services, the school district enrolled him in her inclusion classroom\u00a0 for the remaining months of the school year when it was clear that he needed some extra help. Thanks to her teaching style, her fantastic classroom aides, and the physical setup of her classroom (being an inclusion room, there were already accommodations in place in the room and the schedule), Howie did amazingly well for those few months.\u00a0 Summer came and went, however, and the return to school this past year in a class of 16 kids was difficult for Howie.\u00a0 It was clear to us that something was going on with Howie, and even with all the classroom accommodations still in place,\u00a0 he needed more. I started the paperwork to get him evaluated for autism spectrum disorder, and without hesitation or complaint, Mrs. M filled out every piece of paper required by all the hospitals \u2013 some even three times as I tried to get him on three different waiting lists.\u00a0 She made sure all the reports were in order, and when the time finally came for our appointment, Mrs. M came with me to the parent meeting so that we could all be on the same page when it came to Howie\u2019s diagnosis and what he needed for support.\u00a0 In truth, at that meeting, she was my support.\u00a0 Even though we all knew the ASD diagnosis was coming, it was helpful to have another objective set of ears at the appointment, and I left there feeling a sense of comfort and relief knowing that at last we were all going to work to get Howie on track at school. That was six months ago, and the change in Howie\u2019s behavior both at home and in school has been tremendous.\u00a0 He\u2019s now in the full day special needs program at the preschool with a one-on-one aide, and she worked to design an IEP that is speaks to Howie\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.\u00a0 He\u2019s getting OT and social speech supports in and out of the classroom.\u00a0 She\u2019s come to the house to help us set up activities for Howie when his behavior starts to spiral.\u00a0 Mrs. M worked with the preschool director to create a new classroom setup for next year \u2013 a full day inclusion program for kids like Howie, kids who don\u2019t need to be in the special needs program for the whole day, but who still need the extra support and accommodations of an inclusion classroom.\u00a0 And more recently, she\u2019s been my sounding board again as we got Lewis evaluated for his speech delays, reminding me to go with my gut if I think something just isn\u2019t right, just as she did two years ago. So when I found out that Mrs. M would be moving up to the elementary school to teach the full day inclusion kindergarten class, I could have panicked.\u00a0 The original plan was for her to teach that new classroom setup and be Howie\u2019s teacher again.\u00a0 But as I listened to her talk about her amazing new job, I realized that we were in a great place.\u00a0 While Howie would have a new teacher next year, he would still be at his familiar school, with aides that he knows and kids he recognizes.\u00a0 The transition to a new teacher would be an easier one at the preschool level.\u00a0 The harder transition for him would come in a year \u2013 kindergarten is in a different building, with a different schedule, different kids, and a ride on the big yellow school bus.\u00a0 The possibility that Howie could have Mrs. M for kindergarten \u2013 the potential for some familiarity in an unfamiliar place \u2013 was a huge relief for me. It\u2019s thanks to Mrs. M that I can feel that relief.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know where we would be without her guidance, compassion, and sense of humor.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s a testament to her teaching skills that Gerry asked if she\u2019d be teaching third grade so \u201che could experience what Howie did\u201d.\u00a0 I hope that every kid and family gets to have a teacher like Mrs. M once in their school life.\u00a0 I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll have her twice! \u201cDon\u2019t you ever ask them why \nIf they told you, you would cry \nSo just look at them and sigh \nAnd know they love you.\u201d  \u2013 Teach Your Children Well by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/06/06/teach-your-children-well/", "title": "\n\t\t\tTeach Your\u00a0Children\u00a0Well\t\t"},
{"date": "July 16, 2010", "body": "I am currently overseeing an epic NASCAR-style race through my house. I am supposed to be furiously cleaning.  Every year for my birthday, my mother gives me the present of\u00a0 having my house cleaned.  And finally, exactly six months after my birthday, I have it scheduled for tomorrow.  It is sorely needed, as the house has become a disgusting combination of a movie theater (with those sticky floors) and a public bathroom (I blame that one on the fact that I live with all boys, including one just barely toilet trained). I just can\u2019t keep up with the dirt and the clutter.  My days are filled with refereeing pillow fights or breaking up arguments over Legos and Thomas the Tank Engine trains.  If I turn away for a minute to get the vacuum, or clean a toilet, or empty the dishwasher, inevitably the baby climbs onto something he shouldn\u2019t, or Howie is tickling the baby too hard, or Gerry is trying to watch a show but Howie keeps crashing into him.  I spend more time as a police officer than a housekeeper. The \u201cnice ladies\u201d who are coming to clean gave me two weeks notice (we call them the \u201cnice ladies\u201d because they are nice enough to not call social services on us when they see the squalor that the kids live in).  The woman in charge told me that should give me enough time to \u201corganize things so I could find them again\u201d.  Loosely translated, this means \u201cI\u2019m giving you two weeks so I can find your kids\u2019 bedroom floor\u201d. Recently, my Facebook friends and I had a discussion about which we\u2019d prefer more \u2013 someone to cook for us or someone to clean up after us.  For me, that choice is easy. I absolutely hate to cook.\u00a0  I\u2019m sure some of that has to do with the various food issues in my house.  With my husband\u2019s vegan diet and Howie\u2019s food aversions and intolerances, making one meal for the five of us is quite a chore.  And I\u2019m not good at it.  There\u2019s no satisfaction at all for me in making dinner.  Cleaning is something I actually enjoy.  Sometimes it\u2019s the one tangible visual accomplishment I have \u2013 a clean counter top, a basket of clothes put away in a bureau.\u00a0 I can look at that and say I got something done. But now my two weeks have gone by and I haven\u2019t accomplished anything.  I just can\u2019t get to it all. I\u2019m watching the boys run those laps inside our house \u2013 all three of them chasing each other at a speed more appropriate for a high school track than a living room floor.  Instead of cleaning off my desk so we can tell what color it is, I am yelling things like \u201cThat\u2019s too fast!\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t push your brother out of the way!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going to throw the red flag if you don\u2019t slow down on the corners!!\u201d My husband always reminds me that the only thing that matters is that the kids are happy and healthy and raised in a loving environment.\u00a0  He tells me that the mess in the house should not be seen as a reflection of the chaos and stress of our everyday lives, but rather as a statement that taking care of our kids\u2019 needs come first above all else.\u00a0 He reminds me of this most often when the house is at its most  catastrophic state, perhaps trying to convince us both that this is  true. So with that in mind, I\u2019m waving the checkered flag at the end of the race.

{"date": "July 23, 2010", "body": "\u201cWow!\u00a0 Everything is so\u2026different!!\u201d Those were Howie\u2019s words when we walked in after our big  house cleaning  occurred.\u00a0\u00a0 We had spent the afternoon at a friend\u2019s pool, and came in just as the nice ladies were finishing the last of the dusting.\u00a0 He was right, everything was very different.\u00a0 Clean doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it.\u00a0 The kitchen and bathrooms were scrubbed, the carpets had that cool triangle pattern in them from being vacuumed well, and we no longer stuck to the floor.\u00a0 They even cleaned inside our refrigerator and washed out the dog\u2019s food and water dish \u2013 things I haven\u2019t done since we moved in. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it this different since I was a baby!\u201d Howie had just walked into our toy room.\u00a0 The bookcase that housed his toys and puzzles was up against a different wall, and his Hot Wheels tracks were in a new spot across from the window.\u00a0 The Thomas trains were piled up near the lamp and the blocks were moved up higher. \u201cThis is SO different!\u201d The nice lady in charge was smiling from ear to ear.\u00a0 \u201cI love hearing that!\u201d she said to me.\u00a0 We were both grinning as Howie walked around pointing out all the things that had changed.\u00a0 She was happy because she knew that meant she had done a great job.\u00a0 I was happy that the house didn\u2019t smell like spoiled milk anymore. As I was paying the nice ladies, Howie and Gerry disappeared upstairs to their rooms to see how clean things were up there.\u00a0 First I heard the \u201cWow!\u00a0 This is SO different!\u201d from Howie again.\u00a0 And then, a giant crash. Tim had just walked into the house at this time, and we both went flying up the stairs to see what had happened.\u00a0 The nice ladies had put Howie\u2019s container of Hot Wheels cars up on a shelf so they could vacuum under his bed, and he had tried to pull it back down without help.\u00a0 I made sure he was ok, came back downstairs and continued to marvel at the new color of the carpet. Several quiet minutes went by which in my house is always trouble.\u00a0 I went upstairs to see what was going on.\u00a0 Peeking into Howie\u2019s room, I saw that he had taken out about 20 cars from his container, and he was quietly lining them up in a row. The air went right out of me.\u00a0 Along with running around in circles and babbling, lining up Hot Wheels cars is what Howie does when he\u2019s out of sorts.\u00a0 It\u2019s his way of making order in his world when things are not right.\u00a0 It\u2019s a behavior I haven\u2019t seen from him in a long time, not since we had started him in OT therapies at school. How could I have missed that the \u201cWow!\u00a0 Things are SO different!\u201d was not a statement of happiness, but more of a exclamation of a world turned upside down.\u00a0 The house smelled different, looked different and felt different.\u00a0 In my head I saw this as a positive thing.\u00a0 In his head, nothing felt right. The experience reminded me once again that I have to look at everything through his eyes, even something like cleaning the house.\u00a0 My only thought when scheduling the cleaning was thinking about me and how good I was going to feel walking into a spotless house.\u00a0 I never would have imagined that it would have any impact on my kids, except that maybe now their pajamas wouldn\u2019t be covered in dog hair after playing in their room before bed. It didn\u2019t take long for \u201cdifferent\u201d to become \u201cthe same\u201d again.\u00a0 Within 10 minutes, Gerry had spilled chocolate milk on the kitchen floor.\u00a0 An hour later, every Lego Duplo block we own was spread out all over the toy room.\u00a0 After dinner, dishes piled back up in the sink and leftover crumbs had made their way into the living room.\u00a0\u00a0 And even though Howie was up twice during the night that night for the first time in weeks (new pillowcase and sheets tucked into the bed rail), eventually everything was back to how it was.\u00a0 Not normal.\u00a0 Just our normal. The sticky spot on the kitchen floor is back.\u00a0 It\u2019s just in a different place.\u00a0 And now, the epic NASCAR-style race can continue once again. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/clean-up/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/07/23/clean-up-the-sequel/", "title": "\n\t\t\tClean Up, the\u00a0sequel\t\t"},
{"date": "July 13, 2010", "body": "It was another one of those nights when I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u00a0 By 2am, one kid had woken up once, another twice, and I was wide awake from my efforts to get everyone back to sleep again.\u00a0 So, as I usually do, I just laid there in bed thinking.\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes I think about what to pack the kids for snacks for camp.\u00a0 Or I wonder if I forgot to put the laundry in the dryer. Sometimes I think about the long list of things I haven\u2019t been able to get to.\u00a0\u00a0 This was one of those nights. But instead of the thoughts leading towards my inability to empty the dishwasher, or put the kids\u2019 clothes away in their bureaus, or the fact that the house hasn\u2019t been vacuumed in a week, I started thinking about all the activities I haven\u2019t been able to do with the kids.\u00a0 We don\u2019t go to the playground, or play groups, or museums, zoos, or mini-golf.\u00a0 Or even the library.\u00a0 The kids ask, especially Gerry, but the answer is almost always \u201cnot today\u201d. I laid there thinking of how I got to this place of being so paralyzed by fear or worry about going out with  all three boys.\u00a0 Maybe it was just laziness.\u00a0 When Gerry was little, we did everything.\u00a0 We did an infant play group that morphed into a group of friends that continued to meet for a year after.\u00a0 I took him to gymnastics classes, music classes, playgrounds, day trips, the beach.\u00a0 Gerry was a \u201cgood kid\u201d, meaning of course that he clung to me and was hesitant to join in any rough-and-tumble activity until he warmed up to the situation.\u00a0 That meant that he was never the one to instigate any battles or throw sand at other kids.\u00a0 He would share his toys, almost to a fault.\u00a0 It was never me as the parent doing the apologizing for my kid, the \u201cI\u2019m so sorry he pushed your kid down the slide into the dirt\u201d statements. I closed my eyes and remembered when that all ended.\u00a0 Howie was a cranky, colicky baby.\u00a0 He never napped well, and when he did it was only on my lap or my bed.\u00a0 That completely restricted our ability to do much of anything when he was very little.\u00a0 And as he got older, his sensory issues really started to flare up.\u00a0 Movies and museums became very difficult adventures.\u00a0 And don\u2019t even get me started about the zoo.\u00a0 We took him when he was about 2 years old, and one loud squak from the peacock and we were done.\u00a0 I ended up having to carry him through the rest of the zoo while his face was buried in my shoulder.\u00a0 Even storytime at the library became an impossible outing.\u00a0 Howie couldn\u2019t sit still in the circle to hear the story or listen to the music, so he\u2019d run off.\u00a0 I\u2019d chase him, Gerry would follow me out, and that was the end of that.\u00a0 When Lewis came along, I was finished.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t chase Howie, listen to Gerry complain about what he\u2019d missed, and try to keep a baby asleep through his nap time.\u00a0 So we just stopped. I opened my eyes again and got very sad.\u00a0 What was it that was keeping me from doing these things with the boys now?\u00a0 Was it the fear that something might happen?\u00a0 What could that  something  be?\u00a0 A tantrum? Screaming and yelling?\u00a0 From me or the boys?\u00a0 Was it the fear that we\u2019d see someone we knew while this was going on?\u00a0 Was it the kids that I was worried about, or was it my own pride?\u00a0 I finally settled myself back to sleep, wondering if the schedule for the next day would include more than just a trip to Target. The next morning, I got the kids their juice and checked my e-mail as I usually do.\u00a0 In my  inbox  was this blog post from a mother who is a lot like me.\u00a0 Like me, she had spent the night planning\u00a0 the week for her kid, knowing he needed routine and a schedule.\u00a0 And like me she\u2019s not a planner.\u00a0 In her post, she writes about realizing there were things she hadn\u2019t done yet with her youngest that she used to do with her older one.\u00a0 So she put it on the schedule.\u00a0 It was the push I needed to get us out again. So \u201clibrary\u201d went on the Monday schedule. The boys had been good all day so after Lewis woke up from his nap we got in the hot car and headed to the library.\u00a0 I chose the one in the next town over \u2013 telling the kids that it had better books for their age, but really it was because I figured we\u2019d have less chance seeing someone we knew.\u00a0 We pulled into the parking lot and a big \u201cSorry We\u2019re Closed\u201d sign hung on the door (you\u2019d think they\u2019d update their website with their summer hours!!).\u00a0 So with a deep breath, and with moans from the backseat of \u201cBut we wanted to go to the LIBRARY!!!\u201d, I turned around and headed back to our town\u2019s little library. Luckily for us, and the other people in our town, the children\u2019s part of the library was empty.\u00a0 I could see the surprise on the face of the librarian when we came in \u2013 she recognized me, but not the kids.\u00a0 Gerry wandered around looking for the one book he hadn\u2019t read yet.\u00a0 Howie climbed onto the stool, pulled out three random books and proclaimed that \u201cthese are the ones I want to buy!\u201d.\u00a0 Lewis spotted the crayons, climbed up into a chair, and proceeded to draw all over the table.\u00a0 I felt like I was herding cats. But we survived.\u00a0 Not sure the library did.\u00a0 Somehow we managed to leave with two books for Gerry and three for Howie before Lewis turned off every computer in there.\u00a0 We even signed up for the summer reading program which I may try to actually do this year.\u00a0 With Lewis squirming under my arm, we gathered up our books and climbed back into the now screaming hot car.\u00a0 I was beaming with pride.\u00a0 Hurray for us!\u00a0 We went to the library!\u00a0 And even better, that must have killed an hour or so of the afternoon!\u00a0 It must be almost dinnertime!

{"date": "July 19, 2010", "body": "When I became a parent for the first time, I sought out many different mothers who had been there before, learning all I could from them in an attempt to become a better mother myself. When I became a parent of a special needs child, I only sought out one. Let me tell you about this friend of mine. And even though I have chosen to share our story publicly, she has not.\u00a0 So for the purposes of this post, I will call her \u201cHope\u201d. I met Hope on the first day of preschool for my oldest son Gerry.\u00a0 Having just moved to town a month before school started, we didn\u2019t know anyone at all.\u00a0 As we waited outside the school doors for the teacher to arrive,\u00a0 Gerry hid behind my leg and I wrestled with Howie, who was then 6 months old.\u00a0 Hope\u2019s son came right up and introduced himself to us.\u00a0 Hope, slightly embarrassed by her son\u2019s forwardness, came up to first apologize and then say hello herself.\u00a0 She was so kind and welcoming that day that I tried to seek her out each afternoon from then on.\u00a0 We discovered that we had a lot in common and quickly became friends.\u00a0 Gerry had his first solo playdate at her house that fall. I can\u2019t remember the exact moment when she confided in me that her older son was on the autism spectrum.\u00a0 However, I clearly remember my response: \u201coh, really?\u201d\u00a0 That was all I said.\u00a0 At the time I really had no idea what she was talking about.\u00a0 Autism was a foreign word to me \u2013 conjuring up images of \u201cRain Man\u201d and rumors of what I had heard about Albert Einstein.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t really compute with me.\u00a0 I had seen her son when we were over for those playdates.\u00a0 He could talk.\u00a0 He could read and play and communicate.\u00a0 There were times when she had pulled him aside for breaks, and had told me it was because he was\u00a0 on a strict behavior plan.\u00a0 I thought she was just describing her parenting style to me. I didn\u2019t really think of it much after that day.\u00a0 We continued to get together for playdates, although they became harder to plan when the kids ended up in different kindergarten and first grade classes.\u00a0 Hope and I would also try to get together without the kids so we could have some time to talk without interruption. It\u2019s around this time that I started to notice things going on with my own son Howie\u2019s behavior.\u00a0 First it was his food aversions \u2013 his reluctance to eat anything with any sort of texture or cold temperature.\u00a0 I remember telling Hope about it, sharing my frustrations and confusion with her.\u00a0 She sat, listened, gave me some suggestions and said \u201cThat sounds a lot like my son when he was Howie\u2019s age\u201d. Then at age two it was Howie\u2019s behavior.\u00a0 His inability to process anything we told him.\u00a0 His strange lack of fear of running into the street and the fact that he couldn\u2019t get it when we told him how dangerous it was.\u00a0 The way he just laughed when we\u2019d discipline him.\u00a0 We had this feeling of complete incompetence when it came to parenting, because nothing we did seem to work.\u00a0 I shared this all with Hope over various phone calls and lunch dates.\u00a0 Each time she\u2019d sit, listen, offer suggestions and say \u201cThat sounds a lot like my son when he was Howie\u2019s age\u201d. It was these last conversations that helped me see what I had been missing with Howie.\u00a0 Clearly something was different about him in the same way that Hope\u2019s son was different too.\u00a0 When our school system evaluated Howie and deemed him ineligible for services, it was Hope that I turned to for advice.\u00a0 She told me to trust my gut, seek out an outside opinion and get on every and any wait list to see a developmental pediatrician. \u00a0\u00a0 And she reminded me that it was nothing to be ashamed of, that whatever we learned could only help us and help Howie. Hope was the first person I called when we finally got Howie\u2019s PDD-NOS diagnosis.\u00a0 I told her what the doctor had said, that she thought Howie was on the spectrum but on the \u201cmild, high-functioning\u201d end.\u00a0 After several minutes of me relaying the laundry list of services and supports that the doctor suggested, I was finally quiet.\u00a0 Hope\u2019s only question to me was \u201cSo, how are  you  feeling?\u201d That\u2019s the kind of person she is.\u00a0 Hope wasn\u2019t curious about the social speech classes, or the ABA services, or the one-on-one aide that the doctor recommended because she knew all about those things.\u00a0 She was more concerned about how I was taking this all in, and how I felt about the diagnosis. \u201cRelief\u201d, I told her.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m really relieved.\u00a0 Now we can move on and get the help we need.\u201d And really, that\u2019s how I feel about Hope.\u00a0 Relief.\u00a0 Relief that I met her when I did so that we could become friends before I needed her guidance and support.\u00a0 Relief that she was smart enough and caring enough to push me in the right direction to get the diagnosis we needed.\u00a0 And relief that I had someone in my life who knew exactly what I was going through. I know that I\u2019m lucky to have had a friend like this.\u00a0 Without her,\u00a0 I\u2019m sure I\u2019d still be struggling with the challenges of figuring out what autism spectrum disorder means.\u00a0 I know there are many mothers and fathers out there going it alone without anyone they can talk to.\u00a0 Every parent deserves to have someone they can turn to who will sit, listen, offer suggestions and say \u201cthat sounds just like my son\u201d.\u00a0 Every parent deserves a \u201cHope\u201d. \u201c When you\u2019re down and  troubled and you need a helping hand \nand nothing, whoa, nothing is  going right. \nClose your eyes and think of me and soon I will be there to brighten up  even your darkest nights\u2026 \nyou\u2019ve got a friend. \u201d \u2013 You\u2019ve Got A Friend by James Taylor \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/07/19/youve-got-a-friend/", "title": "\n\t\t\tYou\u2019ve Got\u00a0A\u00a0Friend\t\t"},
{"date": "September 2, 2010", "body": "A Letter to My Son\u2019s New One-on-One Teachers: Dear Mrs. L and Mrs. C, First let me tell you how happy I am that you both are working with Howie this year.  It gives me great comfort to know that the two of you are part of his team.  This will be an important transition year for him, and I\u2019m so glad that you\u2019ll be a part of that. Since this is the first time you\u2019ve worked with Howie in this setting, I thought I\u2019d give you some sense of where he is today since school ended in June.  I figured it might be best to break it up into subjects and write about his strengths in those areas as well as where he might need some more guidance. Language : Howie has come quite far over the summer with his use of language in general, and more specifically appropriate social language.  He\u2019s become much clearer in using his words to convey his thoughts and frustrations and has become quite a deep thinker (asking a LOT of \u201cwhy\u201d questions and is very curious about the world around him).  He relies less on noises and babbling than he did before and is more interested in trying to get his point across.  The echolalia has decreased quite a bit and he has a better handle on using words and phrases (and expressions) in the correct way. With that comes new challenges for him.  He still struggles with the appropriate tone and volume of his words, as well as the appropriate social language when playing with others or attempting to join in with others.  He is still quick to get frustrated when things are exactly his way, or how he thinks things should be, so the need for perfection is still there. Howie will also \u201clevel up\u201d or \u201clevel down\u201d to his surroundings \u2013 meaning that if he\u2019s around kids/adults speaking appropriately and acting appropriately, he will too.  We saw that quite a bit this summer with his older brother.  He was quite articulate when around Gerry.  However, we saw the flip side with his younger brother Lewis.  He would tend to imitate Lewis\u2019 babbling and beginning vocabulary and think it was funny.    We worked hard with Howie to encourage him to be Lewis\u2019 teacher and teach him the right way to say words.  We had limited success with that.  I\u2019m sure his social language skills group will help a lot in that area. Self-care : Howie is completely toilet trained at this point, and now has the language to ask to go the bathroom and will tell you what he needs to do there.  He is not adept yet at wiping himself up after pooping, so just be alert to that. Academic : Howie \u2019s been practicing writing his name and can sound out some  three letter words.  He knows all his letters and letter sounds and can count at least to thirty (maybe higher).  To see this from him, though, he needs to be in the \u201cright\u201d setting.  If he\u2019s overloaded or over stimulated or just silly, he won\u2019t sit still long enough to show you. Transitions :  Transitions have definitely gotten easier for Howie, but he still has a very hard time moving from a preferred activity to a non-preferred one.  We were actually able to move away from using the PECS schedule towards the end of the summer, but I think that\u2019s because camp was in session.  I\u2019m guessing with school back we\u2019ll be using it again at home. Sensory :  This remains Howie\u2019s biggest obstacle by far.  I firmly believe his sensory processing disorder drives his whole diagnosis and affects almost all aspects of his ability to function appropriately in a classroom setting.  He gets easily over stimulated and overloaded, especially if there are many options to choose from and many things going on.  I\u2019ll give you two recent examples from the summer to help illustrate my point:  one morning before camp, Howie fell into the toilet when he tried to sit down to poop.  While he seemed to recover ok at the time, he was incredibly out of sorts for the whole day \u2013 clinging to me on the way out of the car, a ton of babbling and giant hugs on our way into camp, and then he had an incredibly hard day at camp.  The sensation of falling, the feeling of his pajamas being wet, and the fear and anger than came with him falling in to the toilet did him in for the whole day. \nAnother example comes one night when he was in his room alone.  He came running out of there screaming because he \u201cwas trying to read and the clock was TOO LOUD!!\u201d.  This is not a new clock, but because he was trying to concentrate on a book the ticking bothered him.  We gave him some headphones and moved him onto his bed away from the clock and he calmed down and read his book. Both examples were interesting to me because in one case (the toilet) he was so overwhelmed that he couldn\u2019t tell me what was wrong until hours later but in the other case (the clock) he knew right away and could express it.  We\u2019re working hard on moving towards the latter, but sometimes just removing him from the situation and asking him what is going on (now that his language is better) is the key to understanding his difficult behavior. One phrase you might hear from him quite a bit is \u201cMy bones made me do it\u201d.  Somehow in his mind he has separated out the idea that he doesn\u2019t have control over his behavior, especially when it\u2019s something he wasn\u2019t supposed to do.  We\u2019ve tried to tell him that his brain tells his bones what to do, and his brain needs to tell his bones to make \u201cgreen choices\u201d, etc.  Just wanted you to know what that means if/when you hear it from him. More recently, he\u2019s developed aversions to certain smells, so there\u2019s a chance that someone\u2019s lunch or snack may bother him if it\u2019s next to him, but it\u2019s mostly noises and movements and crowds that are his triggers.  Eating his own food is still a struggle sometimes.  I will try to pack a variety of things that I think might interest him, as well as some consistent choices so he doesn\u2019t get upset.  He likes his yogurt smoothies in a particular way, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll tell you how \ud83d\ude42  There may be days when he eats it all, or days when he won\u2019t eat a thing.  I\u2019m not worried about it as long as he tries to sit with everyone. I\u2019ll be sending a lot of this to the school OT as well.  His biggest issue is still self-regulating, and he may need or ask for many squeezes and hugs, or many jumps on the trampoline to help get his body feeling better.  We\u2019ve seen this mostly after eating or after a tough transition. I will do my best to let you know that morning if anything is already off with him (bad night sleep, more toilet mishaps, etc.) so you have a heads up for the day. Overall I think Howie has grown a lot this summer.  He\u2019s become much more independent minded and interested in trying new things on his own.  He\u2019s developed quite a sense of humor as well and has a new love for learning that is just very cool.  I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll be able to show all that to you and more.  He\u2019s quite aware now of the log sheets that you fill out, since we go over them at the end of the day and he gets rewarded for making all \u201cgreen choices\u201d.  I\u2019m hoping he has many of those days with you. Thank you again!  I\u2019m very excited for school to start. Sincerely, \nAlysia As a note, a few books that might help understand Howie and his sensory issues more are \u201c The Out-of-Sync Child \u201d and \u201c Sensational Kids \u201d.  They both really describe him perfectly.  I have copies of both books and am happy to lend you them if you want. \u201c You are my sunshine, my only sunshine \nYou make me happy when skies are gray \nYou\u2019ll never know dear how much I love you \nPlease don\u2019t take my sunshine away .\u201d \u2013 You Are My Sunshine by Bing Crosby \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.out-of-sync-child.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Sensational-Kids-Children-Processing-Disorder/dp/0399153373"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/you-are-my-sunshine/", "title": "\n\t\t\tYou Are My\u00a0Sunshine\t\t"},
{"date": "July 27, 2010", "body": "This was going to be a post today about the power of words.  About how important it is to choose our words and tone carefully when we speak to each other because you never know what is going on behind that other person\u2019s closed doors.  About we should use our words to lift each other up, and not to knock each other down. But life got in the way today. Today I finally took my head out of the sand and brought my youngest in to our doctor for a referral for a hearing test. I\u2019ve known for a while that his speech was delayed.\u00a0 We\u2019ve all known.\u00a0 And thanks to some gentle prodding from my support group friends, I called our doctor to get his ears looked at.\u00a0 At the visit, our pediatrician listened to me talk about how early intervention didn\u2019t pick him up for services because he wasn\u2019t delayed  enough  at 19 months.\u00a0 She listened to me as I told her that he\u2019s trying to communicate, but just can\u2019t make the sounds, that nothing has progressed beyond the most basic words and every other attempt at new words sounds like he\u2019s under water.\u00a0 She listened to me as I shared my frustration because I just didn\u2019t know what to do to help him along. Then came the questions to me: Did I remember if he was delayed in his babbling as an infant?\u00a0 Does he seem to be getting frustrated because he can\u2019t communicate with us?\u00a0 Can he identify different sounds, directions, different people\u2019s voices?\u00a0 She\u2019s asking me these questions through his blood curdling screams as she\u2019s cleaning out the giant balls of wax out of his ears. The answer given by this guilt-ridden mother of three?\u00a0 I have no idea. And as that guilt swirls around in my head, I hear words like \u201cimmature speech\u201d and \u201cpossible ear fluid\u201d and \u201coral-motor function\u201d.\u00a0 Phrases like \u201cThe Learning Center for the Deaf\u201d and \u201cplaying catch up\u201d.\u00a0 Reminders like \u201creduce that pacifier use as much as possible\u201d. After all the ear flushing and scraping is done, and after all the screaming has subsided thanks to a Curious George sticker, we make our way home with referral in hand.\u00a0 And I think  we know he can hear.  He understands EVERYTHING.\u00a0 He can get his shoes and bring them to me when he hears it\u2019s time to go in the car. He can hear a plane going by overhead.\u00a0 He can dance along to \u201cBad Romance\u201d and hand the remote to me when it\u2019s over.\u00a0 He can mimic the Elmo\u2019s World music.\u00a0 He just can\u2019t say shoes, plane, Lady Gaga or Elmo. And of course, I wonder if it\u2019s something I\u2019ve done.\u00a0 Was it too much TV?\u00a0 Not enough reading?\u00a0 Too much of everything else going on?\u00a0 Did his brother\u2019s autism pull me away from him too many times that I couldn\u2019t help him learn his words earlier?\u00a0 And as a family, can we really go through this again?\u00a0 It\u2019s not about finding the physical strength to go through the potential therapies, doctor\u2019s visits and all the work.\u00a0 It\u2019s about finding the emotional time and energy to make it all happen. I have to remember it could be so much harder.\u00a0 He is a happy, healthy, loving little boy who is full of energy.\u00a0 He has a laugh that is infectious and a smile that can light up your day.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t have delays in any other area and we don\u2019t see the other signs like we did with his brother.\u00a0 S0 I have to have some hope.\u00a0\u00a0 Hope that it\u2019s just a speech delay and nothing more.\u00a0 Hope that it\u2019s something that a few months of therapy will correct.\u00a0 Hope that someday I\u201dll hear him yell \u201cMama\u201d because he\u2019s looking for me.

{"date": "August 1, 2010", "body": "Something happened yesterday that hasn\u2019t happened in a very long time. We had an almost perfect day. It was a day when there was much potential for things to go badly.  With the exception of swimming lessons for the older boys in the morning, I had nothing planned for the day.  And in many many cases that is a recipe for meltdowns, arguments and disaster in our house. But it didn\u2019t happen. We started to have some trouble brewing just about lunch time.  The boys were hungry and wound up from swim lessons, and the doughnut snack on the way home probably didn\u2019t help.  We had all just come in from being outside in the backyard so I could put Lewis down for his nap.  The potential for mischief was running high.  But right then, a plan popped into my head. \u201cHowie, you sit nicely while Daddy gets Lewis to sleep and we\u2019ll switch your car seat for Gerry\u2019s old booster seat.\u201d  He had been asking for months if he could finally have a booster seat.  I told him that he needed to be in underwear full time before that was possible.  Really, it was a way to buy time so he could finally meet the weight requirements for the booster.  Plus, I liked that he was completely strapped in, unable to escape his seat by himself.  But since diapers were now a thing of the past (yea!) and he had cracked that magic weight number, I figured it was time follow through and make the switch. \u201cReally?  I can really have Gerry\u2019s old black and gray booster seat that is in the garage?\u201d Nothing is cooler to Howie than his older brother\u2019s stuff, and he was making sure we were talking about the same seat. Gerry, Howie and I went out to the car to get the old seat while Tim put Lewis down for his nap.  Howie helped me carry the old one into the garage, and put the booster into the same spot in the car.  Gerry told him to try it out, and we buckled him in with the real seat belt.  Howie started making all sorts of faces\u00a0 in the mirror in front of his seat in the car.  We\u2019ve had that mirror there since he was an infant and just never bothered to move it. \u201cWhat are you doing?  Are you uncomfortable?\u201d,  I asked. \u201cNope,\u201d came the answer.  \u201cI\u2019m just seeing how much older I look in my new seat.\u201d We took a drive around the neighborhood to test it out.  Throughout the whole ride he was quiet, staring at himself in the mirror.  When we pulled back into the driveway he proclaimed \u201cI am SO OLD now!\u201d.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t lying. Buoyed by that success, I decided to take it one step further and pulled out Gerry\u2019s old bike with training wheels from the back of the garage.  All summer Howie\u2019s been afraid to try it, preferring instead to stick with his Little Tykes bike that is lower to the ground.  I convinced him this time that since he was big enough now for the booster seat, he was big enough for the real big boy bike. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll try it, \u201d he said, \u201cBut only if you hold on.\u201d I didn\u2019t. And it didn\u2019t matter.  Because within a minute he was pedaling himself around the driveway as if he\u2019d been riding that bike all summer long. \u201cI\u2019m SO BIG NOW!\u201d, Howie exclaimed.  \u201cI am going to ride my bike all day and all night!\u201d I\u2019ll admit, I got a little teary.  I spend so much time focusing and obsessing about what he  can\u2019t  do, and how hard things are and will be for him in the future.  It was about time I stopped to celebrate what he  can  do now and what he might be able to accomplish someday . While he didn\u2019t ride all day and all night, he did ride in a circle in the driveway for two hours straight.  He got good enough to avoid Lewis running after him, and could get himself over the cracks in the driveway.  We took a break for dinner (out to Pizzeria Uno\u2019s where everyone ate their dinners without complaints \u2013 another miracle of the day!) and played outside until the mosquitoes started to bite.  There was no whining or tantrums about showering or teeth brushing, and all three boys ended the night together in my bed laughing hysterically watching an episode of \u00a0 \u201cWow Wow Wubbzy\u201d. The day was not without its bumps in the road.  Gerry and Howie argued over which one of them would get to be the police officer on their bike and which one was the bad guy.  They cut each other in line climbing up on the swing set to get to the slide first.  But these were, dare I say, \u201ctypical\u201d sibling interactions.  There were no complaints from Gerry that Howie was making his \u201cannoying noises\u201d. Howie wasn\u2019t running laps in the house trying to get his energy out or crashing into his brothers.  It was just a regular beautiful day. I\u2019d like to chalk it up to the fact that I\u2019m finally starting to understand Howie\u2019s needs more and anticipate them, and the strategies and therapies that we\u2019ve worked on are starting to kick in.  More likely it\u2019s the fact that this was the first Saturday in weeks that it wasn\u2019t 90% humidity and 95 degrees outside.  And I\u2019m guessing that the large Dunkin\u2019 Donuts iced latte I had on the way home from swim lessons helped as well. Whatever it was that made the stars align as they did, I\u2019ll take it.  These have been rare days this summer and they need to be celebrated.\u00a0 It was an amazing way to end what had been a very difficult month of July.

{"date": "September 5, 2010", "body": "I\u2019m sitting on the floor of our toy room watching my son. He\u2019s at our Fisher-Price toy kitchen, pretending to turn on the water and wash his hands. He fills up a cup from the pretend blender and hands it to me, pushing it towards my mouth so I\u2019ll pretend to drink from it. I take a sip, say \u201cthat was delicious!\u201d, and hand it back to him. With a smile, he pretends to wash the cup in the toy sink and puts it away. He picks up the toy phone from its pretend cradle on top of the kitchen, and babbles into it (sounds vaguely like \u201cHello?  Small cheese pizza with a side of garlic bread? Bye!) I smile.  He turns to me and laughs.  He grabs a plate from inside the toy refrigerator, takes a spoon, and hands it to me.  \u201cEat!\u201d, he says. I know enough to recognize what this all is now.  This is  pretend play . But it\u2019s not from my 4 year old. It\u2019s my 22 month old. And it\u2019s making me very sad. My 4 year old never did this at 22 months.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t do it at 2 years old, or even at 3 years old.\u00a0 Just now, after a year of special services through his school, are we seeing this type of pretend play. I\u2019m trying hard to stay in the moment \u2013 to sit and laugh and eat my pretend food like a good mother should.\u00a0 I should be celebrating the fact that my youngest is meeting all his milestones.\u00a0 He\u2019s finally starting to talk in a way that doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s under water.\u00a0 In almost every way, he\u2019s right where he\u2019s supposed to be. But all I can do is think how how different that has been for my 4 year old. My 22 month old plays better, eats better, holds a spoon and fork and crayon better and sleeps better than my 4 year old.\u00a0 For goodness sake, they are only 3 pounds apart, even though 2 1/2 years separate them.\u00a0 And it worries me.\u00a0 For both of them.\u00a0 What will happen when they are both older and the distance between their skills becomes more noticeable \u2013 more obvious \u2013 to the outside world and to each other? I\u2019m snapped out of my sadness by a sudden hug from my 22 month old.\u00a0 A real hug.\u00a0 A \u201cthank you for playing with me Mom\u201d hug.\u00a0 I hug back and ask for more pretend juice. My 4 year old spots us playing and comes running into the room.\u00a0 \u201cCan I have a tea party too?\u201d I make room for him in front of the tiny pretend kitchen and he gets himself a cup.\u00a0 He asks his baby brother to pour him some juice from the pretend blender and they both pretend to have a drink.\u00a0 They giggle and I have to laugh too. They are pretend playing together.\u00a0 And I realize that I have to stop comparing my kids.\u00a0 All three boys will do their own things in their own time.\u00a0 One may be reading chapter books at age 6, one may be able to name every single Hot Wheels car in our house, and one may be able to sing along with Lady Gaga.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter how long it took my 4 year old to get to this tea party.\u00a0\u00a0 Every  milestone and every step, he\u2019ll be a bit behind where he\u2019s supposed to  be.\u00a0 But he\u2019s here now.\u00a0 That\u2019s what my focus needs to be. In my house, there can\u2019t be any  supposed to be  anymore.\u00a0 Just where we are now.

{"date": "March 21, 2010", "body": "One hour.\u00a0 That\u2019s how long it took for me, Howie , and Lewis to walk a loop around our neighborhood today.\u00a0 It\u2019s a walk that would normally take us 15 minutes, with both kids in the stroller and me in \u201cexercise mode\u201d.\u00a0 However, today Howie wanted to walk himself, and not ride in the stroller.\u00a0 I had grand plans of pushing them around the neighborhood quickly, getting the workout I desperately needed in enough time to get back for the bus while Lewis slept in the stroller. But it was a beautiful day, and we left the house with time to spare, so I let him walk. We started out slowly and then moved to a crawl.\u00a0 Howie\u00a0 stopped to pick up every purple leaf, and literally smell every dying flower along the way.\u00a0 He stomped on an acorn, and then plopped himself on the sidewalk to examine what was inside it.\u00a0 He peered through the neighbor\u2019s bushes to see what was behind them, and touched the ReMax balloon on a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign at the bottom of the street.\u00a0 I found myself checking my watch every five minutes, constantly saying \u201cHurry up, we don\u2019t want to be late to get Gerry at the bus.\u201d\u00a0 But there was no hurrying him.\u00a0 He meandered up and down the street, asking questions about what the street signs said and stopping to listen to the birds \u201csinging to each other\u201d. As I was about to tell him for the 40th time to hurry up,. I stopped myself and just watched as he chased after \u201cthe biggest leaf I have EVER seen, Mommy!\u201d.\u00a0 What was I hurrying him up to do?\u00a0 We had plenty of time and Lewis was quietly sleeping in the stroller like I planned.\u00a0 What was the rush?\u00a0 My husband and I had just spent that morning meeting with a child development psychologist, talking about working together to help Howie with his behavior issues.\u00a0 The psychologist wanted to hold off on any testing until Howie was four, because he felt that he was getting help already in school and that four was a good age to do the kind of testing that he felt he needed.\u00a0 I wanted the testing done  now , so I could find out what was wrong and get the help he and I needed at home as soon as possible.\u00a0 I was looking for some sort of magic \u2013 someone to tell me you need to do this, this and this and everything will be ok.\u00a0 What the psychologist told me was that there was no immediate solution.\u00a0 There was a lot of hard work that we needed to put in every day to be able to see the results we wanted, and that it was work that would be ongoing for a long time. As we continued on our way, I realized that this walk was an example of what we needed to do as a family to help him and us all.\u00a0 I needed to put aside the constant need to keep moving \u2013 whether it was on a walk around the neighborhood, or always running errands to keep him out of trouble in the house \u2013 and just put in the effort and time to sit with him and find out what makes him tick.\u00a0 For that hour that we walked, things were perfect.\u00a0 He listened.\u00a0 He held onto the stroller when we crossed the street without having to be told.\u00a0 He laughed and sang and left Lewis\u00a0 alone so he could sleep. We finished our loop of the neighborhood and stopped back at the bus stop.\u00a0 He turned to me and said \u201cMommy! Can we do that again?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 I promised him we could.\u00a0 If he was willing to put in the time, so was I. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/03/21/the-long-and-winding-road/", "title": "\n\t\t\tThe Long and\u00a0Winding\u00a0Road\t\t"},

{"date": "September 10, 2010", "body": "Do you hear that? Me neither.\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing to hear.\u00a0 My house is completely quiet. Two kids at school.\u00a0 One toddler napping.\u00a0 Not even the TV is on.\u00a0 Just the quiet hums of the refrigerator and the baby monitor. There have been no morning meltdowns.\u00a0 No tantrums about getting dressed or putting shoes on.\u00a0 Howie even managed to eat something before we left every morning (granted, one morning it was goldfish, another oatmeal cookies, but at least he had something in his stomach before we left the house). No phone calls from Howie\u2019s school telling me they made a mistake with the full day inclusion class.\u00a0 In fact, no phone calls at all from either kid\u2019s school (except the one the first night from Howie\u2019s lead teacher, telling me he had a GREAT day!\u00a0 I\u2019ve already nominated her for teacher of the year).\u00a0 I know we\u2019re lucky.\u00a0 We live in a great school district with teachers who really seem to put kids \u2013  all kids  \u2013 first. So today, total quiet. We have almost survived the first week of school unscathed. But I\u2019m waiting for the shoe to drop.\u00a0 I jump whenever the phone rings and glance at the caller ID before I answer, bracing myself for what it could be.\u00a0\u00a0 So far, just friends calling to say hi.\u00a0 They have the same silence in their house.

I\u2019ve been reading a lot of  posts  lately about the first week of school, and the consensus is that we all hate the fact that we expect the worst and are relieved and surprised when things go just fine.\u00a0 We wonder why we have to feel that way, and if all parents feel this\u00a0 or is it specific to us parents with special needs kids. I worry about all my kids, but I think it\u2019s the nature of the spectrum disorder to expect the unexpected.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we live with each day \u2013 never knowing what the trigger will be for that moment and all the preparation and all the social stories can just get throw out the window if one thing doesn\u2019t go as planned.

{"date": "September 15, 2010", "body": "On my soapbox for one moment. I read a lot of blogs.  I mean A LOT.  Probably too many (I think my husband would say scratch the \u201cprobably\u201d).  But I do it for a reason.  In my constant struggle to become a better parent \u2013 maybe a more understanding parent \u2013 I search out others who are experiencing what I am and try to learn from their successes and lessons learned. I read all these blogs because the mainstream parenting magazines just don\u2019t fit my family anymore.  I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve picked one of them up with the teaser \u201cTips to help your picky eater!\u201d and just put it down laughing.  I need the \u201ctips for helping your kid who will only eat crunchy orange food off of a green plate and has to drink his smoothie through a green straw!\u201d  Not surprisingly, that\u2019s not the headline in next month\u2019s Parents magazine. However, it is the headline in many of the blogs I read.  In addition to the amazing live and in person support group I have, these writers have become my guide through my everyday struggles.  These mothers and fathers live what I live, and through our blogs and comments we share advice, ideas, and encourage each other to press on another day.  Because it\u2019s about our kids.  We know that we aren\u2019t medical experts, but we have been through enough to help others try not to reinvent the wheel. But I\u2019ve noticed lately a weird trend in some of the blog comments I\u2019ve been reading.  Things are starting to get nasty.  Personal.  People attacking the character and background of other bloggers.   I\u2019m not going to link to any of the personal attacks here because I don\u2019t want to give them any more attention than they\u2019ve already received.  But it\u2019s mean and unnecessary, and in many times there just to incite the other readers.  Is that really what we\u2019re all about? Now I haven\u2019t been writing for very long, so maybe this has been happening for a while and I\u2019m just naive. I know that the autism community is divided on many issues \u2013 from causes to treatments to policy issues \u2013 and has been for a very long time.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.  But to call someone a bad person or a bad parent because of what he or she believes or does for their child?  Seems out of character for a community that wants their kids to be treated with respect and dignity in the outside world. My father was the ultimate politician and I learned a lot from watching him.  He would sit down with someone who was completely opposed to his position on a particular issue, listen to them carefully and thoughtfully, and then quietly explain his perspective and point of view.  It was never about him or about pushing his agenda.  He made it about the issue (usually about kids) and helped turn the discussion into a civil exchange of ideas.  He would change the debate.  More often than not, the person walked away with a new way of looking at the problem.  And every time they walked away with a favorable impression of my dad. Maybe it\u2019s time to reshape our debate \u2026again. I\u2019m joining with the amazing editors at the  Autism Blogs Directory  and am taking the next step to help create a new community.  They challenged their readers to pick a blog they have never seen, read it, and leave a respectful and thoughtful comment.  There are so many wonderful writers out there sharing their stories daily and I know I have a lot to learn from everyone. So here\u2019s my pick.  It\u2019s Laura from \u201c Life in the House that Asperger Built \u201c.  I picked it because she\u2019s a mom like me with children on the spectrum.  But she\u2019s also on the spectrum herself, as is her husband. I\u2019m getting a unique perspective from her that I haven\u2019t read anywhere yet, and I\u2019m so grateful for that.  I look forward to learning so much from her. I\u2019m hoping that others take up the same challenge.  On the right side of my home page I have a long list of my favorite special needs blogs \u2013 choose any of them and you\u2019ll find a fantastic writer behind that link.  Have a child with sensory processing disorder?  Click on ANY of my friends who are part of the  SPD blogger network .  A child on the spectrum?  Click on ANY of my friends under \u201cWebsites I Like\u201d. I know that there are people who read this who don\u2019t have kids with special needs (thank you friends and family who are here because I guilted you into signing up!)  I hope you take me up on this challenge too.  Are you a runner?  Check out my friend  Charlotte \u2018s blog.  Interested in parenting and social justice issues?  Read my friend  Gaetane \u2018s blog.  Or go to Google and type in your favorite hobby, click on blogs, and choose the first one that comes up. Take a moment to read their latest post and leave a comment if you can.  It\u2019s the best way to rebuild our communities and support each other.  It\u2019s the best way we can tell each other we\u2019re not alone.  It\u2019s the best way to start again. I\u2019m getting off my soapbox to look  Spectrummy Mummy\u2019s  latest post.

{"date": "March 23, 2010", "body": "I have been reading food labels since my husband became a vegan eight years ago.\u00a0 When my oldest son was diagnosed with milk/soy protein intolerance as a baby, my reading took on a new vigilance, examining each word on every baby food product. I knew every ingredient indicating the presence of foods they couldn\u2019t eat.\u00a0 But the one label I wasn\u2019t prepared to read was the one given to our middle child \u2013 Autism Spectrum Disorder. We had known for a while that something was a little different about him but we couldn\u2019t put our finger on what it was.\u00a0 Finally at age 3 \u00bd our developmental pediatrician told us what we had guessed \u2013 that our son was on the autism spectrum.\u00a0 The CDC estimates that 1 in 110 children have ASD, and even though he didn\u2019t have the classic signs we weren\u2019t surprised by the diagnosis.\u00a0 It was actually a relief.\u00a0 We had tried to get him help, but without the autism \u201clabel\u201d, the right services weren\u2019t available.\u00a0 Now many accommodations were accessible at home and at school that weren\u2019t before. Following his diagnosis, I shared this relief with family, friends and the autism community through an essay on the Autism Speaks website ( http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/01/22/in-their-own-words-welcome-to-the-community/ ).\u00a0 Using my son\u2019s name and story I illustrated how amazed I was to be so welcomed into a family of people struggling with our same issues. I didn\u2019t think how my need to share was potentially \u201clabeling\u201d my son for life on the internet.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t stop to explain to family and friends what autism spectrum disorder meant for our son. I agonized over what I had done \u2013 \u201couting\u201d my son as autistic without his consent or concern for his privacy. But in the end it was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. I realized that regardless of the stigma associated with autism, this is who my son is and will always be. Without that label, he could have spent years struggling with the most basic life and educational skills.\u00a0 As parents our job is to help our son understand what his diagnosis means, and how it makes him special in so many ways.\u00a0 And as my son\u2019s mother, it\u2019s my responsibility to help others get past their lack of knowledge, read his label, and see him for the remarkable little boy that he is. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/01/22/in-their-own-words-welcome-to-the-community/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/reading-labels/", "title": "\n\t\t\tReading Labels\t\t"},
{"date": "May 8, 2010", "body": "On this Mother\u2019s Day eve, I am sitting with Gerry as he watches \u201cStar Wars\u201d for the first time.\u00a0 As with all holidays, it\u2019s hard not to take this moment to reflect back on the past year since last Mother\u2019s Day.\u00a0 Seeing as I am distracted by \u201cthe Force\u201d and by looking over at Gerry\u2019s face every 5 minutes to make sure he\u2019s not too scared, I\u2019m reduced to writing this as a list. \u2013 I\u2019ve gone from having two boys and a little baby to having three full fledged boys in the house.\u00a0 There is no \u201cbaby\u201d Lewis anymore \u2013 now, at 18 months, he\u2019s almost as big as Howie and just as strong.\u00a0 He sits on Gerry\u2019s lap for a book, he runs screaming with laughter through the house with Howie, and climbs on to the windowsill yelling \u201cDada Dada!\u201d when Tim\u2019s truck pulls into the driveway.\u00a0 Best of all, he finally said \u201cMama\u201d.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t to my face, but to others when I left the room.\u00a0 I\u2019ll take it. \u2013 My vocabulary has expanded in ways that I never expected, and in some ways wish it hadn\u2019t.\u00a0 I am now intimately familiar with acronyms like \u201cIEP\u201d, \u201cOT\u201d and \u201cASD\u201d, and with words like \u201csensory integration disorder\u201d, \u201cstimming\u201d, \u201cproprioceptive\u201d, \u201cperseverate\u201d, \u201cweighted blankets\u201d and \u201cautism\u201d.\u00a0 However, the more I understand these words, the more I understand Howie.\u00a0 And I wouldn\u2019t trade that knowledge for anything. -In this year I have strengthened the incredible friendships I had before, and made some amazing new friends.\u00a0 At a time when I needed my friends the most, they were there for me and a few went above and beyond the call of duty.\u00a0 My new friends have come to me through my journey with Howie, and I have come to value their advice, commentary and sense of humor.\u00a0 We have come to this common place by different paths, but our shared goal is to make our kids the best they can be.\u00a0 Without them, I would be lost. -More than ever, I have become acutely aware of how lucky I am to live where I do.\u00a0\u00a0 I live in a state that values its citizens by covering many medical procedures that aren\u2019t available in other places.\u00a0 I live in a town where people care about one another, look out for each other, and bring in their neighbors\u2019 trash cans when they are away.\u00a0 I live in a school district that puts their students first, so that I am not fighting tooth and nail for the services that my family needs. -Maybe it\u2019s because for the first time in 4 years I finally had six hours of straight sleep, but I finally decided to start taking care of me and asking for help from others.\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to run every morning with a goal of running the Flutie Foundation 5K in October, and without my friend pushing me to run to \u201cjust one more mailbox\u201d, I\u2019d probably still be on the couch.\u00a0 I\u2019m taking the 2 hours I get in the middle of the day while Lewis is napping to just relax, read, write and play Facebook Scrabble, and not run around the house obsessing over all the things I can\u2019t accomplish quietly enough to keep Lewis sleeping.\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to make sure I get out of the house with some friends at least once a month for dinner, drinks and conversation that doesn\u2019t revolve around the last time someone pooped.\u00a0 And for the first time ever, I\u2019m hiring a babysitter for a couple hours a week in the summer with the hopes that someday Tim and I might actually get out of the house together on a regular basis. \u2013 But most importantly, I have learned a lot about me as a person and a mother.\u00a0\u00a0 I have finally made peace with the fact that I am not, and will never be, the world\u2019s most perfect mom.\u00a0 In fact, I have moments when I\u2019m not sure the title of \u201cworld\u2019s most average mother\u201d would fit.\u00a0\u00a0 I have lost permission slips, forgotten appointments, sent a certain 2nd grader to school with an expired snack, yelled, screamed, and threatened to just walk away. There are some moments in the day when even \u201cCalgon\u201d couldn\u2019t help take me away.\u00a0 But I know that at the end of the day I am the \u201cworld\u2019s best mom that I can be\u201d.\u00a0 I will be there for my kids in whatever way needed and will fight for what they need to the end. Speaking of that, it\u2019s time to say goodnight to Gerry.\u00a0 We turned the movie off after an hour when I noticed him staring wide-eyed at the TV on the edge of the couch.\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot of movie for a kid who, at age four, cried at the movie \u201cCars\u201d because he was sad that Lightening McQueen didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to Mater.\u00a0 We\u2019ll watch the rest tomorrow night as way to end to Mother\u2019s Day together. Happy Mother\u2019s Day to me and all the other mothers, mothers-to-be and mothers-should-be out there. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/05/08/mother-and-child-reunion/", "title": "\n\t\t\tMother\u00a0and\u00a0Child\u00a0Reunion\t\t"},
{"date": "May 14, 2010", "body": "Remember back in high school when every family member, friend, neighbor would ask you constantly what college you were going to?\u00a0 And then once you were at that college, those same family members, friends and neighbors would quiz you about what your major was going to be and what you were going to do with that degree after college?\u00a0 I remember feeling so annoyed at repeating myself \u2013 feeling like I just wanted to wear a sign saying \u201cUniversity of Vermont, Geography Major (no, not Geology), and I plan to fold a lot of maps\u201d. That\u2019s how I felt yesterday as I spent yet another two hours of my day on the phone with various OT clinics, trying to get some information on getting Howie evaluated for his sensory issues, and when we could start treatment.\u00a0 He\u2019s getting OT services through his IEP at school but his OT there feels like he needs additional work for deep pressure and movement regulation \u2013 stuff he just can\u2019t get at school. For what felt like the 1,000th time,\u00a0 I went through our whole story.\u00a0 Yes, he was evaluated by Early Intervention at age two, didn\u2019t qualify for any direct services under their criteria but was picked up under \u201cclinical judgement\u201d for his sensory and feeding problems.\u00a0 Yes, we had OT every other week for an hour for 6 months until he turned three, and was turned over to the school system.\u00a0 No, he still wasn\u2019t eligible for any direct services there either even though his \u201csensory profile\u201d showed a need for extra help, but was placed in an integrated classroom for preschool where he received accommodations just because of the room and teacher he had.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until his PDD-NOS diagnosis that he was eligible for additional school services, and was picked up for school based OT services.\u00a0 And Yes, I\u2019m calling you because we need more \u2013 more home support, more information on helping his body regulation, just\u2026more. And just as I had repeated my story for the 1,000th time, I got the same response back for the 1,000th time.\u00a0 Oh yes, we can help him.\u00a0 We have a sensory gym, one-on-one OT services, feeding therapies, you name it.\u00a0 But did I mention we have a large waiting list for treatment?\u00a0 Did I mention that we could get you in for an evaluation, but the cost is $900 and we don\u2019t take your insurance (or any insurance at all)?\u00a0 Oh, and did I mention that we\u2019re 45 mins away, and that you\u2019d have to schlep all your kids in the car back and forth to a one hour appointment once a week?\u00a0 And did I mention that it might not even help? I hung up the phone with the last clinic feeling utterly frustrated.\u00a0 It shouldn\u2019t be this hard to get my little guy what he needs.\u00a0 And it shouldn\u2019t have to be at the expense of my other kids.\u00a0 You like to think you\u2019d go wherever, spend whatever if you know it would help your child.\u00a0 But the reality is, it doesn\u2019t always work that way. Just as I was about to call one of the clinics back to set up an appointment, I got a call back from Howie\u2019s OT from early intervention.\u00a0 I had called her to ask for referrals or names of clinics that she would recommend for him, knowing his needs.\u00a0 After talking for a while, she mentioned that she does home based OT work in the evening hours, if we were interested in that.\u00a0 It was like a light had gone on in my dark world.\u00a0 Home based?\u00a0 Working on the specific problems we had at home within his own space and in the environment that triggers the sensory meltdowns?\u00a0 Why had I not thought of that before, and why had no one mentioned that to me as a possibility?\u00a0 It made so much sense, especially to do it with someone he knows already. I\u2019m still in the process of working this out, making sure it\u2019s the right path for us.\u00a0 But all it took was one person to bring me out of frustration and show me that there\u2019s another path.\u00a0 And that makes all the difference. \u201cEveryday is a winding road \nI get a little bit closer \nEveryday is a faded sign \nI get a little bit closer to feeling fine\u201d \u2013 Sheryl Crow \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/05/14/everyday-is-a-winding-road/", "title": "\n\t\t\tEveryday is\u00a0a\u00a0Winding\u00a0Road\t\t"},

Not really I guess. Maybe a little? Are you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he responded. \u201cI\u2019m a little out of sorts.\u201d \u201cI could tell. You think it\u2019s because you\u2019re not feeling well?\u201d He had been battling a mystery fever for the past two days. No other symptoms, just a low grade fever. \u201cNo. Not that.\u201d He was looking up \u2013 not at my face but just passed me. I stood over him as he stayed cocooned up on the floor. \u201cWhy do you think you\u2019re out of sorts?\u201d \u201cSensory overload,\u201d he replied. His eyes shifted and immediately connected with mine. \u201cReally. What overloaded you?\u201d He sighed. \u201cLife.\u201d Howie paused for a moment. \u201cSometimes that just happens,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cI need a fidget. Like something rubber. Or a ball.\u201d He said it in a very quiet, almost nasally voice. It\u2019s the voice I recognize when he\u2019s uncomfortable. I looked around quickly in his room. \u201cI found a small Minecraft Creeper figure. Will this do?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d He took it from me and smiled. I took a quick picture of him on the floor with the creeper and showed him his happy face. He stayed on the floor for a few minutes, rubbing his hands over the figure and squeezing it. I left the room to help Lewis into the shower. When I returned, he was dressed in his pajamas and in bed. \u201cCan I share the picture I took of you with the creeper to show people how you look when you\u2019re back in sorts?\u201d He snuggled under the covers and grabbed his weighted stuffed animal. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t share it. Can I have a Mom squish?\u201d I leaned over and squished him tight. Part of his self-advocacy has to be the right of refusal of what I share and what I don\u2019t. \u201cI won\u2019t share it. I promise. I love you.\u201d I took my position at the end of his bed. He slid his legs under mine and fell asleep. ********** I could write about the sheer enormity of that conversation and what it means for him, for me, and for the people in his world. About how much hard work he has done with his teachers and therapists to get here \u2013 to not only understand his body but express it in a way that we could understand. I could write about all the signs I missed during the day today that could have told me what he so eloquently did tonight and even though I preach \u201cbehavior is communication\u201d, I ignored it all. I could write that. But right now I am just listening to him sleep. Soft, even breaths. The ones that I now recognize come when he\u2019s back \u201cin sorts\u201d.

{"date": "August 27, 2014", "body": "It\u2019s May, 2014. We are sitting in Lewis\u2019 kindergarten transition IEP meeting.\u00a0 As a team we are reviewing every service and service delivery to make sure it fits right for Lewis as he leaves preschool.\u00a0 It\u2019s not my first rodeo and I have plenty of anxiety over the whole transition process based on past experience.\u00a0 Lewis\u2019 incredible preschool teacher and team know this \u2013 and know Lewis \u2013 and we discuss every detail to make sure we are all on board and understand how kindergarten will look for him for the new school year. We discuss his social skills programming, his need for visual and written cues when transitioning, his extended school year plan, and all the supports he will need for success. \u201cSo now let\u2019s talk transportation,\u201d says his teacher. I sit up straight in my chair, stiffening a little. \u201c I know this is something that we\u2019ve talked about in the past.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t really feel like he needs specialized transportation.\u00a0 I really think he will be okay on the big bus.\u201d \u00a0 His teacher stops talking for a moment. \u00a0 \u201cUm, you don\u2019t agree?\u201d Tim elbows me. \u201cYou\u2019re pulling on your sleeves,\u201d he says.\u00a0 That\u2019s my \u201ctell\u201d.\u00a0 My sign that I\u2019m having an anxiety attack. \u201c It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think he can\u2019t be on the big bus.\u00a0 It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d  I take a breath. \u201c It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to manage all three kids getting to school at different times with different modes of transportation .\u201d ************ This morning I sent a message to my friend  Jess . \u201cI\u2019ve officially lost my ability to write,\u201d I texted.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m trying to write about how Lewis taking the bus and me driving Howie is an example of not just our acceptance of what each kid needs but an understanding of those needs\u2026.None of the kids asked why one was going to school one way and one another\u2026we\u2019ve taught them that everyone is different with no stigmas attached.\u00a0 But the words aren\u2019t coming without sounding stupid\u2026\u201d And she gave me brilliant advice like she always does: \u201cStart in the middle.\u00a0 Where the feelings are.\u00a0 Don\u2019t try to start at the beginning.\u201d Where the feelings are. So here goes. A long time ago,  that meeting would have made me sad . The big bus would have seemed like \u201cThe Holy Grail\u201d of transportation.\u00a0 Going to school the way most kids do.\u00a0 Getting that big \u201cfirst day of school\u201d bus picture.\u00a0 I would have looked at it as one of my kids can ride the bus and one of them\u2026 can\u2019t . My anxiety in that meeting would have\u00a0 focused on their disabilities in the negative, the kind of deficit model of looking at challenges and accommodations as a something bad and temporary with the hopes that maybe someday things will get better. I would have focused on the fact that I had one kid whose challenges kept him off the big bus, while both his big brother and little brother were able to ride it. But here\u2019s the thing.\u00a0 I\u2019m not that me anymore. Last school year, we took Howie off of the mini bus. He had been  riding the mini-bus since kindergarten  to and from school and it\u2019s written into his IEP that he needs specialized transportation. But for second grade,\u00a0 I started driving him to school and he would taking the mini bus home.\u00a0 He needed a \u201csensory overload free\u201d way to enter school in order to start his day off right.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone or have anyone talk to him.\u00a0 About halfway through the year, that need for a sensory overload free trip became evident for the ride home as well.\u00a0 He would be able to use his calming tools to get through the school day, but have a very difficult time with that on the way home. Once I began driving him both ways, his stress level leaving the house and coming home lessened greatly, spilling over to a better day at school and at home in the afternoon. It wasn\u2019t that he  couldn\u2019t  take the mini bus.\u00a0 Or even the big bus. It was that both of those choices weren\u2019t right for him.\u00a0 For his success \u2013 academically and emotionally \u2013 he needed me to drive.\u00a0 This accommodation was no different than any of the other supports listed in his IEP. Two kids \u2013 two brothers \u2013 with the same autism diagnosis.\u00a0 Needing two completely different accommodations. Perhaps it\u2019s semantics again . But changing the question from \u201cCan my kids do something\u201d\u00a0 to asking\u00a0 \u201cwhat is appropriate for them\u201d \u2013 it made all the difference. \u00a0 ********** May 2014 \u201cSo what do you think?\u00a0 Do you think Lewis can take the bus to kindergarten?\u201d All eyes of the team are on me. \u201cI know that with a lot of prep he can.\u00a0 I think we should give it a try, \u201d I say. \u201c Are you worried that Howie will be upset or jealous that Lewis is on the big bus?\u201d I smile . \u201cNo, actually, I\u2019m more worried that Lewis will wonder why he doesn\u2019t ride with Mom to school .\u201d I say.\u00a0 \u201c But   he will know that\u2019s just how he gets to kindergarten.\u00a0 And Howie will know that too. \u201d I sigh. \u201c It\u2019s the logistics that make me nervous.\u00a0 Gerry\u2019s bus to the junior high comes at one time, the elementary school bus at another.\u00a0 And somewhere in there I need to drive\u00a0 Howie to the elementary school too.\u00a0 But we will figure it out.\u00a0 We always do.\u201d I shift in my seat, pulling at my sleeves. \u201c Can we talk again about the fact that my last kid is leaving this amazing preschool for kindergarten?\u00a0 I\u2019m not so sure  how I feel about that\u2026\u201d ********** We talk a lot in our house about fair not meaning equal.\u00a0 My kids have seen the cartoon of three characters of all different heights looking over a fence.\u00a0 They each have different sized boxes to stand on so they can see over the fence line.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t equal sized boxes.\u00a0 Each character needed something different to get them to the same place. We\u2019ve never said \u201cI hope someday you can take the big bus to school.\u201d In our town, some kids walk.\u00a0 Some arrive in cars.\u00a0 Some take the big bus.\u00a0 Some take the mini bus. There\u2019s no better or worse way to get to school.\u00a0 For my boys, there\u2019s no stigma attached to any mode of transportation. My three kids need something different to get them to school. For one, it\u2019s mom\u2019s car. For the other two, it\u2019s the wheels on the bus. All through the town. On the bus yesterday for kindergarten orientation.

{"date": "October 29, 2014", "body": "It was a typical dinner Monday night when everyone was talking over each other and no one was eating. There was bickering. Potty talk.\u00a0 Anything and everything except actual eating. Since this happens quite frequently, I have a mental list of \u201cconversation\u201d topics that usually redirect everyone long enough to get some food into them in between sentences. When I say \u201cconversation\u201d, I mean mostly monologues of non-related topics, but each kid is taking a turn with it, allowing the others to eat. And when I say \u201ctopics\u201d, I mean I ask them about Minecraft.\u00a0 So just one topic.\u00a0 Singular. Tonight was no exception. I entered the cook time into the microwave and turned towards the boys at the table. \u201cSo, guys, if you could create your own Minecraft Mod, what would you do?\u201d (ed note: a mod is a modification made to the Minecraft code.\u00a0 Gamers write code to create these mods to add additional things to the original game.\u00a0 My friend Bec at  Minemum  can explain it all.\u00a0 I know nothing about it except that my kids are obsessed with watching videos about them and begging me to download them.) \u201cI would create a space world where things could explode!\u201d replied Howie. \u201cI would create a place where animals could go and there would be explosions!\u201d said Lewis. I took my dinner out of the microwave and sat down at the table. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cif I was creating a mod, I would make a sensory gym mod.\u201d I gave Tim a little smile. I was completely kidding.\u00a0 I half expected them to come out with a \u201cWhat?! That\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d and go back to discussing how to explode creepers and zombies. Howie looked right at me.\u00a0 \u201cA sensory gym mod?\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cIt could have stuff in it like at  SenseAbility Gym .\u201d Both Howie and Lewis were quiet for a moment. \u201cWe would call it The SenseAbility Craft Mod!\u201d said Howie.\u00a0 \u201cWe could craft a trampoline out of leather and and blocks.\u00a0 And it would be bouncy like slime. You\u2019d make it on the crafting table!\u201d \u201cAnd you could make a bolster swing too, \u201d said Lewis.\u00a0 \u201cYou would need string.\u00a0 And something to sit on.\u201d I sat in stunned silence. Howie\u2019s eyes got huge and bright. \u201cAnd the villagers \u2013  they would be autistic villagers! \u00a0 They would be the ones who could be in the SenseAbility mod.\u201d Tim and I made eye contact. I gave him the \u201cwow\u201d look with my face. \u201cIt would spawn autistic villagers and they would be the only ones in the village.\u00a0 And they would go up to each other and would make the villager sounds and understand each other.\u201d Howie was on a roll and was not stopping.\u00a0 \u201cAnd they would go on the trampoline and the swing.\u201d \u201cCould you craft a weighted blanket?\u201d asked Tim. \u201cOh yes, you could do that.\u201d Howie replied. We were all giggling a little at the ideas, throwing them out one by one. \u201cYou could make a square ball pit with blocks and craft something to put in it!\u201d Lewis exclaimed. \u201cCould you make a wooden slide?\u201d Tim asked \u201cYES!\u201d Howie yelled. \u201cYou could make a slide.\u201d \u201cYou would need some fidgets too in your inventory,\u201d I said to Howie, \u201cjust in case the villagers needed them.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the autistic villagers could trade emeralds for fidgets so they could feel better.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cSpawning an autistic villager is rare but special, you know.\u201d I smiled at him.\u00a0 \u201cYeah buddy, I know.\u201d Howie got up from the table. \u201cLet\u2019s play \u2018SenseAbility Craft\u2019 right now!\u201d \u201cWait, what?\u00a0 Right now?\u00a0 You didn\u2019t eat anything!\u201d But Howie was already gone and Lewis followed right behind.\u00a0 They went into the other room and pretended to be the autistic villagers, happily trading for fidgets. I cleaned up their full plates of food and turned to Tim. \u201cYou better start those Java and coding lessons with Howie.\u00a0 I think he\u2019s on to something.\u201d ********** It was December 2009 when I was listening to the developmental pediatrician list off the \u201cred flags\u201d for autism that she saw in Howie.\u00a0 No pretend play, no ability to think of objects as anything other than their literal use.\u00a0 Focused on the spinning wheels of the car and not the car itself.\u00a0 Can\u2019t do a pretend birthday party. It was August of 2011 when I heard the same thing for Lewis. \u201cYou\u2019ll need lots of work and therapy to develop those skills.\u00a0 I\u2019m not saying he won\u2019t ever have them, but they won\u2019t come naturally.\u201d I left the office each time with my view of the world and my boys tipped on its side. I was crushed \u2013 mostly by the guilt of what I didn\u2019t see. What could I do to help him?\u00a0 Could I help him? Turns out my autistic villagers just needed to figure it out in their own time and their own way, through a game that has no boundaries except the limits of their imagination and creativity. Which, despite what we were told, seems to be endless. I\u2019m looking forward to the day when they create this SenseAbility Craft Mod.\u00a0 I hope they let me play and be a part of\u00a0 their incredible, creative and imaginative world.

{"date": "December 1, 2011", "body": "Too good to be true? Not this time. I\u2019ve never done a giveaway before, but I couldn\u2019t say no to this one. Last week I was contacted on behalf of  Motorola Mobility  to see if I would be interested in testing a  Motorola Xoom  tablet.\u00a0 In addition, they would send me one to giveaway to one of my readers.\u00a0 The Motorola Mobility Foundation partnered with Autism Speaks in San Diego and Chicago to help get tablets in the hands of families with children on the spectrum. And now, they were offering me the chance to put a Xoom in the hands of one of my readers.\u00a0 No strings attached. Knowing the incredible impact that this technology can have on kids like mine, there was no way I could say no. I was very interested to see how the Xoom differed from the iPad, which has made such a difference in our lives in such a short amount of time. I have to say it\u2019s pretty cool. Many of our favorite apps are available on the android platform, such as Angry Birds, Cut The Rope and Fruit Ninja.\u00a0 Many of the Oceanhouse Media books that we like are available too.\u00a0\u00a0 The development process is different for the Android environment, so there are many apps that I\u2019ve never see before.\u00a0 My oldest was particularly impressed with the fact that it has Adobe Flash capability, so he was able to play  Crush the Castle  on the tablet.\u00a0 I could easily access our Netflix account to watch movies, and the music store had lots of free and inexpensive songs to download. The camera was also impressive.\u00a0 I thought Gerry was taking a picture of me with it.\u00a0 Instead, he was using the zoom function to take a picture up his nose: Really? Up Your Nose? I was able to take a quick look at some of the augmentative and alternative communication apps as well.\u00a0 There are a few that are free to try, including Tap To Talk.\u00a0 A quick Google search came up with this list of  AAC Apps for Android , and there were quite a few. There\u2019s also a great list of Android apps for Autism here at  http://www.nerd-news.com/2011/04/awesome-android-apps-for-autism.html . My family was definitely excited to play around with the Xoom and to see all it could offer.\u00a0 Here, they are trying out the  Androidify  yourself app.\u00a0 Because, you know, that\u2019s fun: Want to look like the Android guy? Should we put a parrot on his shoulder? My youngest - Androidified So now you really want one, don\u2019t you? Here are the rules: In keeping with the spirit of Try Defying Gravity, I\u2019d like to know how your child has \u201cdefied gravity\u201d in your eyes.\u00a0 Tell me a way in which he or she has exceeded your expectations or faced down adversity to rise above a challenge. Think of the lyrics: \u201c I\u2019m through accepting limits/\u201dcause someone says they\u2019re so/Some things I cannot change/But till I try, I\u2019ll never know!\u201d My kids amaze me every day with what they can do, even when they are told they can\u2019t.\u00a0 They are constantly reminding me of their strength and capacity for love and passion.\u00a0 They hit the limits and knock them down, making sure I do the same. Leave me a comment with your story.\u00a0 Your comment will be your entry into the giveaway. Here are more rules: The contest is open to U.S. residents only.  (sorry) You must enter a valid e-mail address when you comment on the post, otherwise I can\u2019t contact you. Only one comment per person will count as an entry, but if you have many \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d moments to share, go ahead! The comment must be made on this post.\u00a0 Twitter and Facebook comments won\u2019t count. The giveaway runs from the time that this is posted until December 3rd, 2011 at midnight Eastern time.\u00a0 I cannot accept any entries after that. One winner will be chosen at random on Sunday December 4th 2011 and announced on my  Facebook  page that evening. ********** It\u2019s incredibly exciting to me that I can give this away to one of you.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful to Motorola for giving me the opportunity to share this incredible technology with a deserving family.\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to read all your stories. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mediacenter.motorola.com/Feature/Empowering-Autistic-Children-with-Motorola-XOOM-37bc.aspx", "http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Tablets/MOTOROLA-XOOM-with-WiFi-US-EN", "http://www.physicsgames.net/game/Crush_the_Castle.html", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/upnose2.jpg", "http://appsforaac.net/content/aac-apps-android-0", "http://www.nerd-news.com/2011/04/awesome-android-apps-for-autism.html", "http://androidify.com/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/android1.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/android2.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/android3.png", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Try-Defying-Gravity/151654064855804"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/12/01/defying-gravity-giveaway/", "title": "\n\t\t\tDefying Gravity \u2013 The\u00a0Giveaway\t\t"},

I have a recommendation of lighting the White House blue at Autism Awareness month next year. The White House is not one of the many famous landmarks that has been lit blue in April. I say this because my brother is autistic,\u00a0 and it made me feel great to see all those buildings lit blue, because blue is the autism color. I made a model of the White House from a Lego set I got from Hanukkah. I put blue pieces on it to show what it might look like: The White House...in blue This was just a recommendation.

{"date": "January 11, 2012", "body": "(part two in the  Year of the Oxygen Mask  series.\u00a0 I think there may be more coming) I was sitting in a small restaurant, having lunch with a friend, when everything changed. It was a rare treat.\u00a0 A kid free lunch.\u00a0 My friend lives two hours away and we met in the middle. She\u2019s an autism mama.\u00a0 Just like me. So of course, we talked about our kids.\u00a0 And how the autism diagnosis has changed our lives. The things we do now that we never thought we\u2019d do.\u00a0 And the things we don\u2019t do that we always thought we would. The big pile of resentment that grows with each year, and the need to just let some things go. My friend is a tireless advocate for families like mine, and she had recently run for elected office.\u00a0 I watched her campaign from the sidelines and became emotionally invested in her run, even though I couldn\u2019t actually vote for her. \u201cI think the reason many of us got so caught up in your campaign was because you were doing something bigger\u2026something more than just about autism.\u201d\u00a0 The words sounded weird as they came out of my mouth.\u00a0 Offensive, even. I tried to clarify.\u00a0 \u201cI mean, you were talking about the economy, and schools, and taxes and\u2026regular stuff like that.\u00a0 It was like you had a life outside of all this.\u201d Those words sounded even harsher. My friend, being the incredible person that she is, saw through my fumbling words and understood my intent.\u00a0 She agreed that it was empowering to feel like there was more to her than being her son\u2019s mom. And then I said it. \u201cWe spend so much time helping the world see past our kids \u2018label\u2019.\u00a0 We want people to see them for who they are and not get stuck on the diagnosis. Right?\u201d Right. \u201cWhy, then, are we so connected to the label of \u2018autism mom\u2019?\u00a0 If we don\u2019t want our kids to be defined by the label, then why are  we  so defined by it?\u201d Silence.\u00a0 We both just sat there and let those words hang.\u00a0 And simultaneously, we slumped back in our chairs. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cThe autism diagnosis has taken over my life completely.\u00a0 There has to be more than that.\u201d Our kids need to see us as more than that. ********** It\u2019s a conversation that I\u2019m still playing back in my head.\u00a0 I\u2019m a different person since my kids\u2019 spectrum diagnoses.\u00a0 I had to change.\u00a0 I had to become a stronger person and better advocate for my kids to get the services they need.\u00a0 I had to read things I never thought I\u2019d read.\u00a0 I had to know words that I never knew existed. My kids needed the autism label to get them the help they needed in school and at home.\u00a0 It helps describe why they behave the way that they do.\u00a0 It helps others understand why my boys see the world differently and interact with others in a different way. The \u201cautism mama\u201d label has introduced me to the most incredible people in the world \u2013 people I consider my best friends now.\u00a0 We share a common bond and life experience.\u00a0 They understand why I laugh and why I cry.\u00a0 They are the people I want to be around because they get me. But there is more to us all. When Howie is older, I want him to be able to say \u201cYes, I have autism.\u00a0 And I\u2019m also a husband, father and I love to fix cars.\u201d My sons have autism .\u00a0 It makes them who they are.\u00a0\u00a0 It explains them, but doesn\u2019t have to define them. I am an autism mama .\u00a0 It explains me. But it doesn\u2019t have to define me.\u00a0 I want to say \u201cYes, my kids have autism.\u00a0 And I\u2019m  also \u2026\u201d The next step in The Year of the Oxygen Mask is figuring out what that \u201c also \u201d is. I\u2019m not letting go of the autism mama piece. That\u2019s the most important part of me right now, and probably forever. But I feel like I\u2019m missing some other parts of my full identity. \u201c Scars are souvenirs you\u2019ll never lose \n  The past is never far \n  Did you lose yourself somewhere out there? \n  Did you get to be a star? \n  Don\u2019t it make you sad to know that life \n  Is more than who we are ?\u201d \u2013 Name by The Goo Goo Dolls \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/help/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/01/11/name/", "title": "\n\t\t\tName\t\t"},
{"date": "January 17, 2012", "body": "(note:\u00a0 It\u2019s my day at  Hopeful Parents , but I\u2019m also publishing the post here too.\u00a0 This was something I want to keep here with me for a long time, to refer back to when I need to. So you can read the post  here  or below.) What if someone came to you and said the following things: Why do we view \u201cdisability as a deficit model\u201d?\u00a0 Meaning, why do we look at what people with learning differences are lacking or without?\u00a0 Why do we try to remediate those \u201cdeficits\u201d ? Why are special education graduate programs geared towards teaching \u201cbehavior modification\u201d in the classroom?\u00a0\u00a0  Why aren\u2019t schools interested in understanding why kids think and behave the way they do but instead  focused on fixing the \u201cdeficits\u201d to fit in? Why do we look at celebrities who have disabilities as achieving IN SPITE of their disability, rather than BECAUSE of it? Why do some \u201cfirst responders\u201d like teachers and doctors view disorders like autism as the end of the world for our kids? Why do we believe that people can not achieve because they have a label? One twenty-eight minute video.\u00a0 And all these questions were asked. I watched Garret Westlake, CEO of  Stem Force Technology , talk, and my heart grew.\u00a0 I had hope for the future.\u00a0 Not just for my kids on the spectrum, but for any kid who has been labeled with a \u201cdisorder\u201d or \u201cdisability\u201d.\u00a0 In his talk \u201cDisability as a Catalyst\u201d, he lays out all these questions. Garret flipped the world on its head for me. We\u2019re told as parents that our kids\u2019 disabilities will hold them back. But what if it\u2019s the very thing that moves them forward?  What if colleges looked at a student\u2019s individual strengths and what they could contribute to their campus community, rather than rejecting them based on a composite test score?\u00a0 What if employers did the same? What if\u00a0 special education teachers were trained to understand the science behind our kids\u2019 brains?\u00a0 What if they knew how to find that spark that makes them special and bring it out? What if our kids were made to feel proud of their learning differences?\u00a0 What if someone told them that their Asperger\u2019s was a strength, not a weakness? What if the very thing that makes our kids \u201cdifferent\u201d is what makes them more marketable?\u00a0 More in demand? More incredible? What if we as parents knew that from the start? Watch the video.\u00a0 As my friend Jess said over at  a diary of a mom , people like Garret are \u201c\u2026creating a path to full participation, brazenly removing the barriers to success for people with autism \u2013 and doing it by standing the entire paradigm on its head.\u00a0 This is how it begins.\u201d This is how it begins.\u00a0 I am a hopeful parent again.

{"date": "January 20, 2012", "body": "(part three of the #yearoftheoxygenmask.\u00a0 It\u2019s a trilogy. I think.) January 17th, 2012.\u00a0 10pm I\u2019m sitting on my bed, waiting for the hair color to set it. I\u2019m two hours away from turning 40. I send a message to some friends.\u00a0 \u201cQuick!\u00a0 Best thing about being 40. Go.\u00a0 Before I cry.\u201d And like the amazing friends that they are, they all jumped in with reasons why their forties have been the best. And interestingly\u2026their answers were all the same. Forty was the year that they started really knowing who they were.\u00a0 They looked in the mirror and saw their true self.\u00a0 The pretenses were gone.\u00a0 The need to please everyone was gone. Forty was the year that they started really focusing on themselves. One friend said: \u201cYou know who you are, what matters and who your friends are.\u201d And another friend put it, it was the beginning of \u201cme\u201d. Not in a selfish way, but in a \u201cI\u2019m a person too\u201d kind of way. I wrote back: \u201cOh goodness\u2026this is making me happy and teary at the same time. That\u2019s good right? Could also be the hair dye fumes\u2026\u201d ********** January 18, 2012 10:40am My Facebook status:  \u201cTo my incredible amazing friends who got me over the \u201cI\u2019m 40\u201d angst\u2026I thank you. So grateful for all the birthday wishes today. Got my birthday hugs from the boys, and hot coffee and a great present from Tim. Forty is pretty good so far\u2026 \u201c ********** January 18, 2012 11pm I am saying good-bye to my very good friends as they walk out the door.\u00a0 They are five of the people who know me the best, and they came by for a spur of the moment cheesecake, coffee and chocolate covered strawberry party.\u00a0 They arrived at 8:30, and we sat at my kitchen table and just talked. And laughed.\u00a0 A little about autism, a lot about ourselves and our lives. As I closed the door behind them, I realized this was the first time I had friends over in the evening in almost ten years.\u00a0 My kids had never slept alone long enough or slept soundly enough to ever have anyone here. I told Tim a while back that my thirties were about the kids, and my forties were going to be about me.\u00a0 And him.\u00a0 Us. He reminded me that my forties will still be about the kids, Howie in particular.\u00a0 I know that.\u00a0 And being their mom is the greatest thing that ever happened to me. But it won\u2019t be just about them.\u00a0 It can\u2019t be. Forty.\u00a0 I can do this.\u00a0 This is me. ********** This is why my friend and I were compelled to start  The Oxygen Mask Project . Once upon a time, a group of special needs moms started talking about their lives. They talked about how devoted they are to their children and to making sure that their kids\u2019 needs are met. But somewhere along the way, they had forgotten to take care of themselves. The Oxygen Mask Project has  one mission : to give parents a place to feel supported when they take a moment to catch their breath.\u00a0 Guilt free. ********** January 19, 2012 11:30pm I\u2019m still awake.\u00a0 The house is finally quiet.\u00a0 This has been a tough day for Howie in a string of tough days.\u00a0 He\u2019s stopped eating, only drinking his yogurt smoothies.\u00a0 His aggressions have increased.\u00a0 His behavior is difficult.\u00a0 I can tell he feels out of control of his body. I think he\u2019s fighting off something.\u00a0 Or maybe it\u2019s the change in weather.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what it is and he can\u2019t tell me. I want to help him but I am exhausted. And then I remember the logo from The Oxygen Mask Project: Tomorrow morning, I\u2019m doing something I\u2019ve never done before.\u00a0 My friend is coming over with her son to watch Lewis.\u00a0 I am going out.\u00a0 Not for an IEP meeting, not for a doctor\u2019s appointment. For a hot stone massage. A totally guilty 40th birthday pleasure. The in-her-thirties Alysia would have never said yes to my friend\u2019s offer to watch Lewis.\u00a0 I would have been wracked with guilt about it.\u00a0 My pride would have told me to say no. Now that I\u2019m forty? I am taking care of myself so I can take care of my kids.\u00a0 I need a hour just for me so I can give the other 23 hours of the day to my boys and to Tim. My friend knows that I will pay it forward. Because that\u2019s how we take care of each other.

Gerry came out of the shower and was scrounging around for his pajamas. \u201cMom.\u00a0 I have an idea for that book we were talking about.\u201d He was alluding to a discussion that he and I had had a few months ago.\u00a0 We were talking about his relationship with Howie, and I said maybe we could write a book together about it. \u201cShhhh.\u201d I said. \u201cTell me quietly.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want your brother to hear.\u201d Gerry stopped what he was doing and looked right at me. \u201cWhen are you going to tell him he\u2019s\u2026different?\u201d I stood there.\u00a0 Waiting for what was coming next. \u201cDon\u2019t you think he should know about his autism?\u00a0 So he understands?\u00a0 I know most of his friends are from his school and are like him, so that\u2019s really good.\u00a0 But at some point, shouldn\u2019t he know?\u00a0 Because really?\u00a0 Sometimes it\u2019s very stressful for me that I know but he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 His eyes teared up a little.

It\u2019s like if you\u2019re driving and your car\u2019s wheels lock up.\u00a0 And you hit something and cause a lot of damage.\u00a0 It\u2019s not your fault that the car didn\u2019t work the way it should.\u00a0 Right?\u201d I\u2019m in awe of this kid.\u00a0 Of how much he loves his brother.\u00a0 Of how much he gets it. \u201cMom.\u00a0 Shouldn\u2019t he know so he understands?\u201d \u201cYes.\u00a0 He should.\u00a0 I will ask my friends how and when they told their kids.\u00a0 And what they said.\u00a0 You\u2019re a pretty smart cookie.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s talk about that book.\u201d So, I\u2019m asking you.\u00a0 My friends.\u00a0 When did you tell your kids that they were\u2026different? \u201c I\u2019m accustomed to a smooth ride  \n Or maybe I\u2019m a dog who\u2019s lost it\u2019s bite  \n I don\u2019t expect to be treated like a fool no more  \n I don\u2019t expect to sleep through the night  \n Some people say a lie\u2019s a lie\u2019s a lie  \n But I say why  \n Why deny the obvious child?  \n Why deny the obvious child?  \u201d \u2013 The Obvious Child by Paul Simon \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/12/11/he-aint-heavy-hes-my-brother/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/the-obvious-child/", "title": "\n\t\t\tThe Obvious Child\t\t"},
{"date": "December 21, 2011", "body": "Somehow, we remembered.\u00a0 It must be a Christmas miracle. Last year, a few of my friends from my support group were talking about getting their kids\u2019 pictures taken with Santa at the mall.\u00a0 Or rather, not getting them.\u00a0 The lines, the looks, the sensory overload\u2026it was all too much for their kids. I blurted out, \u201cI wish we could have our own Santa somewhere so your kids could get their pictures with him without worry.\u201d We were quiet for a moment.\u00a0 Then a friend said \u201cMy sister-in-law has a Santa suit.\u00a0 We could do it.\u201d \u201cSomeone remember this for next year.\u201d I said. And somehow\u2026we did. ********** Five of us started talking, and the plan began to come together in mid-November.\u00a0 Instead of our monthly support group meeting, we\u2019d have a holiday party for our families instead.\u00a0 We\u2019d hold it at our local community house for free, have pizza and drinks, and bring in some crafts and toys for the kids to play with. Low key.\u00a0 Joyous and simple, my friend said. And of course, Santa. I recruited my friend\u2019s husband to play the role of Jolly Saint Nick.\u00a0 He\u2019s amazing with kids and has known Howie since he was a toddler.\u00a0 He\u2019s not a special needs dad, but he\u2019s a very special dad.\u00a0 If anyone could play Santa for our kids, it would be him. The RSVPs from our support group friends flooded in.\u00a0 We were expecting 60 people.\u00a0 Thirty-five kids. I got a call that morning from one of the moms in our group.\u00a0 She was coming with her crew \u2013 her husband, her 11 year old daughter, and her 7 year old son, who has autism. She thanked us a hundred times for this.\u00a0 Her son had never seen Santa \u2013 it\u2019s always been too hard to get him out to see him at the mall \u2013 and her daughter still believes and wants to see him too. She said we\u2019ve made \u201cChristmas exciting for her family again.\u201d I almost burst into tears on the phone. ********** The afternoon of the party came and I was a nervous wreck.\u00a0 I only had to bring the Hot Wheels cars, the crafts, and make sure Santa was there on time.\u00a0 For some reason, I felt like so much was riding on this.\u00a0 We were promising our friends so much \u2013 the ability to play and eat and talk to Santa on their own terms.\u00a0 Could we pull it off? We could. ********** Let me tell you something.\u00a0 Our kids\u2026they are something special. They walked into that room and somehow they knew it was a safe space. A place to just \u201cbe\u201d. They sat on the floor and played with cars.\u00a0 They built with blocks and made snowman crafts.\u00a0 They played with what they wanted to play with. Ate when and what they wanted to eat. My friends' kids playing with Hot Wheels Trio Blocks (photo used with their permission) There were no meltdowns.\u00a0 No \u201cinterfering behaviors\u201d.\u00a0 No \u201cnon-compliance\u201d. They were themselves. I made the big announcement that Santa was in the building at 6pm.\u00a0 You could feel the kids\u2019 excitement as he walked into the room. We had a special spot for Santa to sit in the back of the room for photos.\u00a0 Tim set up his camera equipment to get that special shot.\u00a0 Santa gave the kids \u201chigh-fives\u201d and we had a seat next to him for the kids to sit in.\u00a0 Not on him. Because\u2026we know. Santa took his place and the kids made their way over to him in their own way.\u00a0 Some rushed over and got in line.\u00a0 Some moseyed their way over, checking out the scene.\u00a0 Some hung back, going over if they felt like it. Santa on their own terms. No one was more excited to see Santa than my own Howie.\u00a0 My little Jewish boy jumped up and down when Santa walked in.\u00a0 He pulled me down and whispered in my ear: \u201cIs Santa real or fake?\u201d \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I said, holding my breath.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know if he recognized my friend in the suit. \u201cI think he\u2019s real.\u201d he whispered back.\u00a0 Good enough for me. \"I would like a green hot wheels car!\" \"Is there one in Santa's bag?\" Hurray! It's a Christmas miracle! We had kids get their pictures taken with Santa who had never been able to be in the same room with him before. As my friend said: \u201cCommunity house? Free.\u00a0 Pizzas? $10 each.\u00a0 Our kids\u2019 smiles? Priceless.\u201d (my friend's son, photo used with her permission) Ringing Santa's bell so wishes come true (my friend's son, photo used with her permission) First great photo with Santa (my friend's son, photo used with her permission) First time with Santa (my friend's son, photo used with her permission) and my personal favorite photo: My son, giving Santa a high five. Minutes after he told Santa \"I celebrate Hanukkah.\" I wish I had the words to describe the joy in that room that night.\u00a0 Let\u2019s just say that the kids were all full of awesome. That night, a few of us went out for drinks.\u00a0 One of my friends said she\u2019s never seen her daughter that happy. \u201cShe could just\u2026be.\u201d Exactly. There was no stress for our kids to be something else.\u00a0 They were surrounded by acceptance and understanding and pure unconditional love. The way the holidays are supposed to be. ********** I have Santa signed on for next year already.\u00a0 This Jewish girl saw the magic of Christmas and I will never ever forget it. \u201c The moon is right  \n The spirit\u2019s up  \n We\u2019re here tonight  \n And that\u2019s enough  Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  \n Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  \u201d \u2013 Wonderful Christmas Time by Paul McCartney \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/kidsplaying.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/santa.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/santababy.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/santababy2.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/santababy3.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/santababy4.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/santababy5.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/santababy6.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/santababy7.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/santahighfive.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/12/21/wonderful-christmas-time/", "title": "\n\t\t\tWonderful Christmas Time\t\t"},
{"date": "February 2, 2012", "body": "Just before Christmas, I was sitting on the bench at my son\u2019s gymnastics class, chatting with my friends. A mom and dad walked in.\u00a0 They were holding the hand of their young daughter.\u00a0 She was tiny and full of energy, her blond hair flying around as she bounced up and down in front of her parents. I smiled at the little girl and listened while the instructor told the parents about the class. \u201cEach kid is matched up with a helper to move with them through the class.\u00a0 We do stretches and then go through the circuit and we end the day in the big foam pit.\u00a0 Let\u2019s have her join the class and see how it goes.\u201d The little girl took the instructor\u2019s hand and they walked together to find a spot in the circle.\u00a0 The mom and dad huddled together, watching their daughter nervously. I leaned over.\u00a0 \u201cJust checking out the class today?\u201d, I asked. They nodded yes. Instantly I was transported back to January 2010.\u00a0 That first day when I walked in nervously with my son.\u00a0 This special needs gymnastics class was the first place we went after Howie\u2019s diagnosis.\u00a0 I was on edge, only three weeks post-diagnosis.\u00a0 That class was the first thing I ever publicly wrote about Howie\u2019s autism.\u00a0 It was picked up the next week by  Autism Speaks\u2019 In Your Own Words Blog: \n \u201cIs your son on the spectrum?\u201d \n The question was slightly jarring to me. My son and I had just walked into a gymnastics class for kids with autism. We had received his diagnosis only three weeks before, and we hadn\u2019t shared our news with anyone except for close friends and family. It was the first time we had been anywhere that was just for kids like mine and I wasn\u2019t really ready to talk to a total stranger about it. \n \u201cYes,\u201d I answered, trying to keep the conversation short. \n \u201cHi, and welcome! That\u2019s my son over there, and my name is Sandy. How old is your son? Do you live in town? How long have you known your son was on the spectrum? What was his diagnosis?\u201d \n I really didn\u2019t want to answer her. I wasn\u2019t even sure we belonged at this class, and all I wanted to do was pay attention to my son to see how he was responding to the class. I watched the other kids as they came in \u2013 six boys and one girl \u2013 and my first instinct was that we were in the wrong place. One little boy was crying, another was spinning in circles, and another one was running in all different directions. My son\u2018s not like that, I thought to myself.  This isn\u2019t us. \n And then I looked at my Howie. I watched him hold tightly to his one-on-one helper\u2019s hand as they walked on a low balance beam, but he wouldn\u2019t look her in the eye when she talked to him. I watched him try to run away to jump into the comfort of the sensory foam blocks and become so focused on that foam pit that he couldn\u2019t move onto anything else. I listened to him babble while he swayed back and forth on the rings, and saw the terror in his face when the noise level got up too high. The tears welled up in my eyes. We  did  belong here. This is the right place for him. We had found a safe place for him to exercise and develop his muscles in an environment that understood his special needs. For so long we had avoided the \u201cregular\u201d gym classes, music classes, and playgroups because of his behavior. No one here was giving me the usual disapproving looks we get when we\u2019re out places and Howie starts to act up. \n Two years later.\u00a0 Here I was.\u00a0 Asking these parents the same questions asked of me.\u00a0 Watching them wonder if this was the right class for their daughter.\u00a0 I wanted to welcome them in the way my now very good friend welcomed me that day. \u201cIt\u2019s a great class,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve been coming for two years.\u00a0 It\u2019s been great for my son.\u201d Sitting on that bench with my friends, I remembered how hard it was to be there that first day.  \n This other mom was reaching out to make a connection \u2013 to find someone else who struggles on a daily basis like she does \u2013 something I myself had been desperate to do for weeks and months. I was instantly welcomed into a community of people who \u201cget it.\u201d No one batted an eye when Howie buried himself under the foam blocks at the end of class so he didn\u2019t have to leave. I got comforting looks of understanding from all the parents and teachers when he had a major meltdown leaving the gym, and big thumbs up from everyone when we finally got our shoes on and went out the door. These were moms and dads who shared my daily difficulties of just getting out of the house. Finally we were somewhere that felt like we belonged. \n I remember feeling so alone before that moment.\u00a0 Now I sit on the bench with the women who are now my lifeline.\u00a0 Part of a community that understands me and my son. Howie and I went bouncing hand and hand out of the gym when the class was over.\u00a0 The dad was getting the details on paying for the class when we were leaving. \u201cWill we see you next week?\u201d I asked. \u201cYes, most definitely.\u201d he replied. \n \u201cWill we see you next week?\u201d asked the mom. \n \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I replied. \n ********** This Saturday will be the first Saturday in two years that we will not be on the attendance list for the special needs gymnastics class.\u00a0 Howie\u2019s recent behavior changes have made it difficult for him to participate appropriately in class.\u00a0 He\u2019s becoming more aggressive and non-compliant.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had to leave the class early two weeks in a row, the last time because he hit his one-on-one helper.\u00a0 He needs a break.\u00a0 I need to figure out what is causing these changes before he or someone else gets hurt. Howie probably won\u2019t care, since we\u2019ll make sure to see his friends from class in other settings.\u00a0 I am sad.\u00a0 Very sad. It\u2019s not just because it\u2019s the one hour a week I get to talk with my friends while our kids are occupied, although that it a huge part of it. This was our place.\u00a0 The very first place we felt accepted.\u00a0 Our very first community. That little girl and her parents walked into gymnastics to find a place for them. We\u2019re walking out of gymnastics having found that place. We may be leaving the gym, but we\u2019re a part of this community forever. \u201c And it\u2019s so hard to do \n  And so easy to say \n  But sometimes \n  Sometimes you just have to walk away \n  Walk away \n  And head for the door \u201d \u2013 Walk Away by Ben Harper \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/01/18/welcome-to-the-community/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/02/02/walk-away/", "title": "\n\t\t\tWalk Away\t\t"},

A little boy came over and helped me push Howie around.\u00a0 Howie squealed with delight.\u00a0 The boy introduced himself as Zachary and they ran off to play together.\u00a0 Really play.\u00a0 They climbed up on the crash pad and pretended they were jumping out of airplanes.\u00a0 They sat together in the giant tires and pretended they were in spaceships.\u00a0 As they ran from thing to thing I struck up a conversation with his dad. \u201cHow old is he?\u201d I asked. \u201cFive and a half.\u201d he replied \u201c Oh, Howie is too.\u00a0 Well, he\u2019ll be six in March.\u201d The dad paused for a moment, looking intently at Howie.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s not autistic, is he?\u201d I was totally taken aback.\u00a0 Isn\u2019t that why we\u2019re all here?\u00a0 \u201cYes, yes he is.\u201d I say. \u201cOh, wow.\u00a0 But\u2026he talks so well! I assumed he was here with a sibling, like Zachary is here with his younger brothers.\u00a0  His twin brothers are four.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t talking\u2026yet.\u201d His voice trailed off. I told him Howie had a diagnosis of PDD-NOS.\u00a0 He looked at me like I had three heads.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s part of the autism spectrum.\u201d I replied.  It struck me that even within our own community not everyone understands that it\u2019s a spectrum. We talked some more about how tough it is for Zachary to be at home with his brothers.\u00a0 They come to the sensory gym so that all three boys have a place that\u2019s safe for them to play together.  \u201cIt\u2019s so hard for him,\u201d the dad said. \u201cI guess he\u2019ll grow up faster and learn more about life than other kids.\u201d We watched as the boys ran off together again laughing. I had assumed that Zachary was on the spectrum.\u00a0 His dad had assumed the opposite about Howie.\u00a0  I wanted to connect with this family of three boys.\u00a0 I wanted help spread awareness of a different kind.\u00a0 But I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why. ********** Someday, I will buy a \u201csqueeze machine\u201d.\u00a0 So I can see this happy face all. the. time. ********** I am very grateful to our local Autism Alliance center that opens its hearts and pockets to provide these sensory gyms during the winter months. \u00a0 This is how we\u2019ve spent our last two Sundays.\u00a0 The equipment is familiar to my son from school.\u00a0 But most importantly, he is free to choose what he wants to do and what he  needs  to do in that moment.\u00a0 And both weekends, he has made new friends. Can I say that again?\u00a0 My five-year-old kid with deficits in social skills and pragmatic language  made new friends .\u00a0 You don\u2019t have to have your degree in special education to understand why. He\u2019s comfortable.\u00a0 He\u2019s happy.\u00a0 He\u2019s safe.\u00a0 He\u2019s around people who are letting him be. He\u2019s free to be himself. If only we adults could learn from that. \u201cEvery boy in this land grows to be his own man \n  In this land, every girl grows to be her own woman \n  Take my hand, come with me where the children are free \n  Come with me, take my hand, and we\u2019ll run  To a land where the river runs free \n  To a land through the green country \n  To a land to a shining sea \n  To a land where the horses run free \n  To a land where the children are free \n  And you and me are free to be \n  And you and me are free to be \n  And you and me are free to be you and me \u201d \u2013 Free To Be You And Me soundtrack \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/squeezemachine.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/02/19/free-to-be-you-and-me/", "title": "\n\t\t\tFree To Be You And\u00a0Me\t\t"},
{"date": "March 12, 2012", "body": "Nothing like report card day. The double edged sword of your kid doing great academically coupled with 18.6 instances of noncompliance per day, 1.6 instances of aggression per day, 8.6 instances of vocal outbursts per day and .6 instances of violent language per day. -A message I sent to a few of my autism mom friends Friday was report card day.\u00a0 Because I\u2019m so with it these days, I had no idea until a friend posted something about it on Facebook.\u00a0 It\u2019s always a little source of anxiety for me because on the same day that we get the kids\u2019 academic grades, we also get a progress report on Howie\u2019s IEP goals.\u00a0 We meet with his team monthly so there are usually no surprises, but I still get a little nervous waiting for the actual data. And there it was again.\u00a0 In black and white. Howie\u2019s academic report card was stellar.\u00a0 Our school doesn\u2019t give out the usual letter grades, but measures each kid\u2019s progress against the content area set by the state.\u00a0 So a kid is either beginning to understand the concepts, progressing towards the standard, meeting the standard or exceeding the standard. In almost all areas, he\u2019s meeting or exceeding the state standards for each content area. There were just a few progressing towards the standard areas in his ability to write using spaces and writing using conventional and inventive spelling. Howie\u2019s progress towards his IEP goals paints a different picture.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a kid showing 18.6 instances of noncompliance per day, 1.6 instances of aggression per day, 8.6 vocal outbursts per day, and 0.6 instances of violent language per day (data taken over a one week period).\u00a0 During group instruction, he attended to the lesson without interfering behavior in 1 out of 5 opportunities.\u00a0 He was able to identify a problem situation 100% of the time independently, but brainstorm solutions only 25% of the time independently. Reading all this, my heart aches for my kid.\u00a0 He can do the work.\u00a0 He knows his stuff.\u00a0 He just can\u2019t sit there in the classroom and do it. And it means he\u2019s working so incredibly hard to do the work while filtering out all the distractions. Every IEP meeting, when the team asks us what our goal is for the coming year, Tim and I always say we want his teachers to see Howie for the incredibly smart, engaging, amazing kid that he is.\u00a0 We want to help him learn how to control his challenging behaviors so he can be in the classroom and show off all that he can do. We get so focused on those behaviors as being the measurement of his daily success in school.\u00a0 I go right to his log sheet as soon as he gets home to see what kind of day he had.\u00a0 We praise the days he \u201cearned\u201d and we talk about the challenges he had during the day. I go through his work\u00a0 and will pull out his worksheets to tell him that he did a good job.\u00a0\u00a0 And he\u2019s proud \u2013 SO proud \u2013 on those days. But still, his major measurement of success is still his behavior sheets. Not anymore.\u00a0 On Friday, I made a change. ********** I sat Howie down when he got home from school Friday and for the first time we went through his report card together.\u00a0 I explained to him what the letters meant and what it showed that he was learning.\u00a0 I said \u201chere, look it says you know all your uppercase and lowercase letters and can write them all!\u201d and he\u2019d respond with \u201cyes, I can!\u201d\u00a0 And I said \u201cright here it says you can skip count by fives and tens to 100\u201d, and he said \u201cI sure can!\u201d and counted right there for me. I hugged him and told him I was really proud of what a great job he was doing in school with his work.\u00a0 He jumped up and down and went running off happily. Later, at dinner, Tim told him that since he had such a good report card, he could stay up a little later and watch a special show with him and Gerry.\u00a0 It\u2019s usually Tim and Gerry\u2019s special time together, but they were watching a show on aircraft carriers (thank you Netflix) and they thought Howie might like to join them. \u201cOh yes!\u201d came the answer. ********** I really had no idea if any of this had really connected with Howie. Until about an hour after dinner. Howie asked if my mom could send him the special yogurt covered pretzels he likes.\u00a0 There\u2019s a store near her house in Vermont that sells them without corn starch or corn syrup, so he knows he can eat them.\u00a0 I told her to give her a call and ask. Usually, he tells me to do it.\u00a0 Talking on the phone is very tricky for him.\u00a0 Talking in person is hard, but the lack of connection over the phone lines makes any back and forth almost impossible for Howie.\u00a0 Usually it\u2019s pretty one sided. Not this time.\u00a0 For ten minutes, he had an actual conversation with my mother. Yup, a  conversation .\u00a0 First ten minute conversation with her ever. How do I know?\u00a0 Two ways.\u00a0 One, I could tell what she had asked him by his responses. Two?\u00a0 I heard him say \u201cI\u2019m going to stay up late and watch a show.\u201d Pause as she asked him something. \u201cBecause my report card was AWESOME!\u201d ********** Awesome pretty much sums up the rest of the night.\u00a0 Howie, Gerry and Tim stayed up to watch a documentary on an aircraft carrier.\u00a0 Howie asked completely appropriate questions along the way, and Tim stopped the show to answer.\u00a0 Gerry did too.\u00a0 They ate pretzels together and had some juice.\u00a0 When it was over, they talked some more about aircraft carriers until it was bedtime. It\u2019s part of my job as a parent to remember nights like this one.\u00a0 I have to remember that it\u2019s not all about the behavior.\u00a0 We constantly praise the \u201cgreen choices\u201d and redirect for the \u201cred choices\u201d.\u00a0 We work on social skills, sensory integration management and self-regulation. But just like any other kid, my kid wants to feel proud of himself for something.\u00a0 It\u2019s too abstract for an almost six year old to be proud of a day with no \u201cinterfering behaviors\u201d.\u00a0 But a day with an awesome report card? That\u2026that makes sense to him. There\u2019s your positive reinforcement right there. Man, they said we better \n  Accentuate the positive \n  Eliminate the negative \n  Latch on to the affirmative \n  Don\u2019t mess with Mister In-Between \n  No, do not mess with Mister In-Between \n  Do you hear me, hmm? \u2013\u00a0 AC-CENT-TCHU-ATE the positive \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/pillowman.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/ac-cent-tchu-ate-the-positive/", "title": "\n\t\t\tAC-CENT-TCHU-ATE the positive\t\t"},
{"date": "March 14, 2012", "body": "so\u2026um\u2026yeah. Monday I wrote this  grand post  about changing how I view Howie\u2019s days at school.\u00a0 Focusing on the academics.\u00a0 The positives.\u00a0 Not running right to the behavior sheet.\u00a0 And not using that to determine the success of the day. Yeah. I hit publish on that post on Monday and Howie was home 15 minutes later.\u00a0 And I tried.\u00a0 I really did.\u00a0 I waited to check his log sheet, going first to the work.\u00a0 I asked how his day was and got the standard answer of \u201cfine\u201d. And then I went to the log sheet. I get a record of how he did on his behavior plan, separated out by each hour of the six hour day.\u00a0 Only once that day did he \u201cearn\u201d. The other remarks were \u201cvocal outbursts at work requests\u201d.\u00a0 \u201cHit another child\u201d. \u201cScratched me.\u201d (from his aide). When I ask him about it, he shouts \u201cI don\u2019t remember!\u201d and runs away. Yup.\u00a0 Right back again. So there\u2019s my confession.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t even last a day without using his behavior as a measurement of success. I had our regularly scheduled monthly meeting with his teaching team and BCBA yesterday. They\u2019ve taken weeks (months) of data.\u00a0 We\u2019re in crisis mode now. His triggers are unpredictable.\u00a0 All steps to keep him in the inclusion classroom full time have not worked.\u00a0 His sensory toolbox is still being refined and he\u2019s just learning to use it. But it\u2019s not quick enough for them.\u00a0 They can\u2019t identify what will cause the outbursts or aggressions before they happen, so they can\u2019t help prevent it or even teach him how to prevent it. And sure, we can look back and say \u201cOh well, he was getting sick so that\u2019s why he was off that day.\u201d Or \u201cDaylight Savings Time throws him off every year.\u201d Or whatever we define as the trigger after the fact. But it doesn\u2019t \u2013 and can\u2019t \u2013 excuse the violent and aggressive behavior. If we can be honest, we\u2019ve been in this crisis mode since October. It\u2019s March.\u00a0 Eight months into the school year.\u00a0 And all the tweaking and fine tuning hasn\u2019t worked. Socially and behaviorally, he\u2019s made no progress on any of his IEP goals.\u00a0 None.\u00a0 He\u2019s actually regressed. So here we have a kid who academically is shining.\u00a0 But as I wrote on Monday, he just can\u2019t be in the classroom to do it.\u00a0 The large group time is just too much for him. Too many distractions?\u00a0 Sensory overload? Not enough good peer models?\u00a0 Something else? I told his team that I\u2019ve basically put this year behind us.\u00a0 That I hoped we\u2019d start summer school and first grade fresh with a new plan and new goals. The proposal now is pulling him out of inclusion for some portion of the day for direct teaching of behavior modification. \u201c Compliance training \u201c. I told a friend those were my two least favorite words in the English language now.\u00a0 Like, that\u2019s the best name they could call it? Couldn\u2019t we call it something more positive? Maybe \u201cSay Yes To The Dress?\u201d The team told us to think about it.\u00a0 That we would need to sign off on the pull out of the inclusion class for the work. I told them that he was already being pulled out of the classroom because he can\u2019t be there.\u00a0 Right now, it\u2019s in response to inappropriate or aggressive behavior.\u00a0 So if he can\u2019t be there, why not have it be for a positive teaching reason? And perhaps the inclusion model isn\u2019t right for him right now. But that\u2019s the hardest truth to swallow.\u00a0  That\u2019s  the part that gets me.\u00a0 My kid can\u2019t be in the classroom.\u00a0 He needs to be  taught   how to be in a classroom  with 20 other kids. The behavior that comes so naturally to other children is a constant struggle for Howie. The other kids need the academic instruction, my kid needs the behavior instruction. The social/behavioral goals are part of his overall educational success. So while I\u2019d really like to be that mom from Monday, the one that praises and focuses on the academic successes and accentuates the positives? I can\u2019t.\u00a0 I just can\u2019t. The truth is much more complicated. And if we\u2019re being honest, I really really hate that. \u201c Honesty is such a lonely word.  \n Everyone is so untrue.  \n Honesty is hardly ever heard.  \n And mostly what I need from you . \u201d \u2013 Honesty by Billy Joel \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/ac-cent-tchu-ate-the-positive/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/honesty/", "title": "\n\t\t\tHonesty\t\t"},

We\u2019re going his favorite  place  on\u00a0the planet tomorrow. It\u2019s the first real day of summer vacation. We have no routine. In isolation I can take it. I can rationally understand the stimming, the crashing into me. When it is just the two of us, I can let it all go. Let him be who he needs to be. Let him scream, squeal, and climb all over me. But we don\u2019t live in isolation. It affects everyone in the house. \u00a0Constant conflicting needs. I have an older kid screaming at me to make him stop. I have a younger kid mimicking it all and infuriating everyone. I have him trying to choke or push on his younger brother\u2019s belly because he needs a squish. Not malicious. I know he can\u2019t help it. But it hurts everyone else. So I have yelled. Screamed. Yanked him away from potentially hurting his younger brother and pushing him off of me as he tried to climb into my skin. And now I have taken away the one thing that is causing the spiral \u2013 the trip tomorrow. He has to earn it back. Rationally I know this is wrong. Putting the onus on a kid to reverse his behavior that he cannot control. But I have four other people in the family. Including me. They are all mad at me now. And this all combined makes me feel not only like the worst parent in the world but the worst autism parent in the world. Because I should know better right? Me, the advocate for acceptance and understanding and tolerance. The one who goes into his school and reminds them that he cannot help how he behaves in times of stress/anxiety/uncertainty. I shouldn\u2019t yell because none of them \u2013 my whole household full of people somewhere on different parts of the spectrum \u2013 cannot help it. And yet, I did. And now the empty threat of no trip. He and I sat on the stairs for a while. I held him as he screamed that it was everyone else\u2019s fault. \u00a0That they were \u201cblowing up his nerves.\u201d I brought him up to his room just now. Told him this was his safe space to escape just like the Learning Center at school was his safe place there. This was his place for a break. We brought out his train tracks and I told him to build one while I got a hastily thrown together dinner ready for Gerry before baseball in the 100 degree heat. I told him we would earn the trip back together. But I hate this. I really really hate this. Not my kid. Not autism. I hate my inability to handle it. I hate their inability to handle it.

I\u2019m sitting in my winter coat on a beach chair on our lawn.\u00a0 It\u2019s the first nice day of spring but there\u2019s still a chill in the air.

Awareness Howie stops for a moment and gets off his bike.\u00a0 He surveys the track.\u00a0 I can see it in his eyes that something is missing.\u00a0 Something about the track is not quite right. I can\u2019t see it.\u00a0 To me, it is perfect.\u00a0 The lines may not be straight, the arrows showing the right path are jagged. But still\u2026perfect.

We\u2019ve started talking about how his brain works differently than others sometimes.\u00a0 How some things are harder for him at school and somethings are easier.\u00a0 We\u2019ve talked about sensory overload and calming our engines and using his sensory toolbox to help his body feel better. But\u2026we\u2019ve never given it a name. Up to this point, we have been his advocate.\u00a0 I have piles of papers and notes and spreadsheets and doctors\u2019 reports that speak for him. It\u2019s time to teach him how to speak for himself.\u00a0 How to advocate for what he needs and why.\u00a0 Not to escape the hard work or to use as an excuse.\u00a0 But to truly understand what makes him successful.\u00a0 What makes things challenging. So if a kid makes fun of him for flapping his arms up and down when he\u2019s excited, he can say why he does it.\u00a0 Or if an adult makes him look at them in the eye he can explain why that\u2019s hard for him. Or when he creates the most incredible stories and drawings he can explain why his brain works the way it does. Or when he just needs to ride his bike around in circles for an hour before dinner he knows why it makes him feel happy. His older brother Gerry has accepted it.\u00a0 Tim and I have too.\u00a0 We can share our version of Autism Acceptance Month as parents and siblings. But the understanding/awareness/acceptance needs to come from within too.\u00a0 From Howie himself. We will light our house up blue and wear our blue clothes tomorrow. And slowly\u2026in our way and in our time\u2026Howie will understand that we\u2019re doing it for him and  with  him and his younger brother. Awareness and acceptance will begin at home. And then Howie can be the one to share it with others. Free He zips by me again for the 100th time.\u00a0 The early spring wind is starting to kick up and I start to shiver. I ask him to pause for a moment so I can take a picture of the first bike ride of 2013. He stops, smiles, and poses. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I ask. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about being me,\u201d he replies. And he speeds away.\u00a0 The  clank-clank  of the training wheels follow behind. Awareness.\u00a0 Acceptance. Understanding. Starting locally.\u00a0 So he can share globally. \u201c Moving me down the highway \n  Rolling me down the highway \n  Moving ahead so life won\u2019t pass me by  And I\u2019m gonna go there free  Like the fool I am and I\u2019ll always be \n  I\u2019ve got a dream, I\u2019ve got a dream \n  They can change their minds but they can\u2019t change me \n  I\u2019ve got a dream, I\u2019ve got a dream \n  Well, I know I can share it if you want me to \n  If you\u2019re going my way, I\u2019ll go with you  Moving me down the highway \n  Rolling me down the highway \n  Moving ahead so life won\u2019t pass me by \n  Moving me down the highway \n  Rolling me down the highway \n  Moving ahead so life won\u2019t pass me by .\u201d I Got A Name by Jim Croce \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_20130330_154805.jpg", "trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/04/06/blue-moon/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/light-up-the-world/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/the-story/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/our-lips-are-sealed/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_20130330_154453.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_20130330_154542.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_20130330_143509.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/i-got-a-name/", "title": "\n\t\t\tI Got A\u00a0Name\t\t"},
{"date": "February 28, 2012", "body": "I\u2019m not even sure where to start this post.\u00a0 I\u2019m still in awe. Yesterday, Gerry came up to me while Howie was taking a \u201cbreak\u201d.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we call his time in his room when he\u2019s just out of control.\u00a0 He needs to have the quiet alone time to regroup before he hurts himself or someone else. \u201cCan I talk to you a second, Mom?\u201d He pulls me aside, quiet and respectful.\u00a0 Again, he doesn\u2019t want  his brother to hear . \u201cI was watching a  Brain Pop video  about autism.\u00a0 And one about ADHD too.\u00a0 Does Howie have ADHD as well?\u201d I explained that he didn\u2019t have an ADHD diagnosis\u2026yet.\u00a0 But we know that he has difficulties with attending in class and that he can get hyperfocused on one activity, so some of what the movie talked about would sound like how Howie behaves. \u201cWell, the movie said that people don\u2019t outgrow the autism or ADHD.\u00a0 That they have some of the same difficulties once they become adults.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s true, I said. Gerry lowered his voice and looked right at me.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen when he\u2019s thirty?\u00a0 They don\u2019t have \u2018time outs\u2019 when you have a job.\u00a0 You just get fired.\u00a0 And\u2026\u201d his voice wavered a bit. \u201cI\u2019m worried about that for him.\u201d I thought about my friend Jess and  the conversation she had just had with her daughter .\u00a0 Was he worried for Howie or worried that he\u2019ll be the one taking care of him? It will be okay, I said.\u00a0 That\u2019s why he has his home therapists coming in all the time.\u00a0 That\u2019s why he has one-on-one aides helping him now.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing a lot for him now to teach him coping strategies to help him in the future. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s working,\u201d he mumbled, as he walked away. ********** Later that night, Gerry calls me in to his room.\u00a0 He wants to show me his latest \u201cinvention\u201d. \u201cI made a \u2018green choice/red choice\u2019 meter,\u201d he said, alluding to the words Howie\u2019s school uses for appropriate behavior (green choices) and inappropriate or dangerous behavior (red choices). \u201cLook.\u00a0 I made a scale of green choice squares \u2013 dark green and light green.\u00a0 Then I made a yellow square in the middle.\u00a0 That\u2019s to tell him to slow down and take a \u2018balloon breath\u2019.\u00a0 Then I have light red for red choices and dark red for dangerous choices.\u00a0 I have an arrow that I attached with velcro so you can move it depending on the type of choice he\u2019s making.\u00a0 That way he can see and change it himself.\u201d Making the 'choice-o-meter\" Uh, wow. \u201cCan I show him?\u201d he asked. Of course, I said.\u00a0 But I\u2019m the one who tells him if it\u2019s a red choice or green choice.\u00a0 The feedback has to come from me, not you.\u00a0 It\u2019s not your job to correct his behavior. Gerry called Howie in to his room, which is a miracle in itself.\u00a0 Usually, the place is off limits to his brothers because of past Lego smashing incidents. Gerry explained the \u201cchoice-o-meter\u201d and how it worked. Howie LOVED it. maybe a little too much After this, they made a \u201cTell-You-What-To-Do-In-The-Shower 3000\u201d. Together. It was a four step illustration of how to take a shower, from getting undressed to turning off the faucet. we may watch too much \"how it's made\" Howie jumped up and down and begged to take a shower right at that moment. ********** Tonight, right before dinner, Gerry came down from his room with an idea for \u201cinvention #3\u201d. \u201cI know Howie has a hard time sitting down at the table to eat dinner.\u00a0 I made a treasure map for him.\u00a0 I want to put velcro on the map for him to put stars on for every bite that he eats.\u00a0 And then he makes it to the \u2018treasure chest\u2019 \u2013 dessert.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t know how many stars to put on.\u00a0 Twenty?\u201d Let\u2019s start with seven, I said.\u00a0 Just to see how it works. \u201cPerfect!\u201d\u00a0 Gerry ran off back to his room.\u00a0 My calls of \u201cdon\u2019t forget you still have homework to do!\u201d were completely ignored. Fifteen minutes later, he came down with this: Arrgh! You will eat your dinner! The map starts with all the stars off, and with each bite Howie takes, he puts a star on the map.\u00a0 But be careful as you go near \u201cSkull Rock\u201d and \u201cPirate\u2019s Pond\u201d. Howie\u2019s behavior therapist happened to be here tonight, so I had Gerry show it to her. She was blown away. We\u2019ve spent months trying to figure out how to get Howie to eat\u2026anything. We sat at the table for a pasta dinner.\u00a0 Something Howie will never eat. Gerry and the therapist explained the map to him and put it by his plate.\u00a0 I told Gerry to let Howie\u2019s therapist be in charge of the map and stars so that Gerry could just eat his dinner. Fifteen minutes later, all the stars were on.\u00a0 One piece of pasta at a time.\u00a0 But he ate it. I\u2019m not sure which kid was more proud. ********** I have no idea what spurred this on.\u00a0 Maybe it was the Brain Pop video.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s Gerry\u2019s need to try to \u201cfix things\u201d, just like his dad.\u00a0 Not cure, but make it better.\u00a0 Through  inventions and ingenuity . Or maybe it\u2019s just purely out of love for his brother.\u00a0 The overwhelming love that makes him want to help his little brother succeed in life. Whatever it is, I know they will be okay.\u00a0 It won\u2019t always be pretty.\u00a0 Or perfect.\u00a0 Or easy. But they\u2019ll have each other.\u00a0 That I know for sure. \u201c So much has changed \n  So much has happened these years \n  Still find you are waiting here \n  We have a bond that nothing can change \n  And still I find a peace of mind \n  Whenever I hear your name  I find my brother in there \n  Here in my heart \n  I find my brother in there \n  Holdin\u2019 my arms \n  I love you \u201d \u2013 Brother by Toad The Wet Sprocket \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/the-obvious-child/", "http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brainpop-featured-movie/id364894352?mt=8", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/the-covenant/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/photo1.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/photo2.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/photo3.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/photo4.jpg", "http://www.spdbloggernetwork.com/2011/03/22/you-cant-always-get-what-you-want/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/brother/", "title": "\n\t\t\tBrother\t\t"},
{"date": "September 30, 2013", "body": "Yes, once again, I know that\u2019s\u00a0 not a real song. A year ago, I wrote The Ballad of SenseAbility Gym.\u00a0 The post was about a vision.\u00a0 A dream.\u00a0 An idea of creating a space where all children and their families are welcomed and accepted. A year ago, I wrote this: It\u2019s an original title for a brand new project of mine. \n It\u2019s perhaps the most important thing I\u2019ve done since marrying my husband and starting my incredible family. \n My very dear friend and I are opening a parent-led sensory gym.\u00a0 As a non-profit. For kids just like mine. \n We\u2019re calling it \u201c SenseAbility Gym: A Sensory Gym for Sensational Kids \u201c The more we talked to people: parents of kids with special needs, parents of kids without special needs, therapists, teachers, you name it.\u00a0\u00a0 Not one person told us it was a bad idea.\u00a0 In fact, they all said we had to do this. And this: We believe in the fact that all children deserve access to the types of therapeutic equipment used in their schools and their private occupational therapy clinics and we believe that parents need to interact with their children to learn what helps their child \u201cfeel better\u201d and have fun. There are four important components to our mission. \n \n Community: SenseAbility Gym wants its members to feel welcome, and part of the special needs community. \n Safe Sensory Play: SenseAbility Gym wants parents of children with special needs to feel there is a safe place to bring their children for fun, exercise and sensory support. \n Acceptance: SenseAbility Gym will have an environment that recognizes that all special needs children are different and that all learning styles, personalities, and abilities are welcome. \n Support: SenseAbility Gym will be a place where families of special needs children can go to meet other families who share the same struggles. \n \n We see the gym as a place not only for our kids and kids like ours to accommodate their sensory needs, but also as a place to build their social skills and interact with other children like them.\u00a0 We see the gym as a place where moms and dads can interact with parents just like them. \n As Howie told me the other night: \u201cSenseAbility Gym is a place where kids can learn to get along.\u201d \n We see it as an another piece of the support team helping families know they are not alone. Then I wrote this: I need you to tell people about us .\u00a0 Maybe you know a family who has a child with special needs in our area who could benefit from a membership at the gym.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s your own family.\u00a0 Maybe you work for a company that is generous with community giving.\u00a0 Maybe you know children who need to raise money as a community service project and they would like to purchase a piece of equipment. \n I need you \u2013 my friends and family \u2013 to help make this gym a reality.\u00a0 Not just for my kids or my friend\u2019s kids. \n But for mom who told me at our town\u2019s Day In The Park that her daughter needs a place like this. \n For the parents sitting in an Early Intervention family group right now wondering where they could find a safe place to meet once their kids turn three. \n For the dad who is desperately looking for a way to connect with his autistic son, but can\u2019t afford the play equipment his child needs. And you came through.\u00a0 We had support come in from all over the country. People not only wanting to help us financially, but with advice.\u00a0 People who knew people in our area.\u00a0 People who wanted to open their own space in their own towns. Thanks to you, we raised the money we needed to open the doors of SenseAbility Gym in February of this year. That vision \u2013 that dream \u2013 for a community where everyone is accepted and welcomed came true.\u00a0 We may have created the physical space, but the over 200 children and families that we have met since then have made the vision a reality. I could write and write about this amazing place, but the stories aren\u2019t really mine to tell.\u00a0 They are theirs: This place has given me a purpose.\u00a0 It has connected me with the most incredible business partner and friend.\u00a0 It has created a space where my kids are welcomed and accepted and known by name. The families who come in have become my second family. Thank you to every one of you who has supported us in this journey. Our community is so grateful. ********** I\u2019m not very good at asking for money, but I have to.\u00a0  SenseAbility Gym  relies on private and corporate donations and grants to stay open.\u00a0 No one at the gym takes a salary for working there.\u00a0 We keep our membership fees low so every family can afford to come. To do that, we need your support.\u00a0 Every dollar goes right back into the gym \u2013 towards new equipment purchases, our rent and insurance, and programming costs for our free special needs yoga classes, social skills/friendship groups and parent meetings.

{"date": "December 11, 2013", "body": "Dear Facebook, We\u2019ve been together a while, me and you.\u00a0 A little over five years now at this point.\u00a0 And you know how I feel about you.\u00a0 Addicted from the start.\u00a0 Heck, I wrote about you and it was my first published piece \u2013 in  The Boston Globe Magazine  no less. I\u2019ve tried to quit you but I can\u2019t.\u00a0 I have too much personally invested in you: time, friends, and relationships.\u00a0 I can\u2019t walk away. Professionally, however, you\u2019re making it really hard to stay. Like many others, I read the article in  Ad Age  last week and choked a little: The article states: \u201cIf they haven\u2019t already, many marketers will soon see the organic reach of their posts on the social network drop off, and this time Facebook is acknowledging it. In a sales deck obtained by Ad Age that was sent out to partners last month, the company states plainly: \u201cWe expect organic distribution of an individual page\u2019s posts to gradually decline over time as we continually work to make sure people have a meaningful experience on the site.\u201d\u201d \n \u201cA Facebook spokesman confirmed that the overall organic reach of Facebook posts from brands is in slow decline. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to a place where because more people are sharing more things, the best way to get your stuff seen if you\u2019re a business is to pay for it,\u201d he said.\u201d So here\u2019s the thing, Facebook.\u00a0 I\u2019m a small blogger with a small audience.\u00a0 I have a fan page with about 700 \u201clikes\u201d.\u00a0 They are truly mine. I didn\u2019t pay for any of them. These are people who decided that they like what I write about my family and about our journey and they want to read more.\u00a0 I am incredibly grateful for each and every one of them and they are my online support group and community.\u00a0 Because of my readers I have learned so much about my children, about autism, about sensory processing disorder, and about being a parent of three boys.\u00a0 Many of my readers have become my \u201cin real life\u201d friends, without whom I would be lost.\u00a0 I share my personal blog posts on my blog\u2019s Facebook page for that community.\u00a0 I also share others\u2019 posts there too \u2013 many talented writers who are on the same journey because I love what they have to say and know others would as well.\u00a0 Not only is it a way to spread awareness, it keeps my personal Facebook page from getting filled with articles that half of my friends don\u2019t care about. So when I look to see that only 100 of the 707 people who like my page have seen my last post?\u00a0 I\u2019m at a loss. Additionally, I\u2019m a small business owner.\u00a0 Of a small nonprofit.\u00a0 We serve our local special needs community with our indoor sensory gym.\u00a0  SenseAbility Gym  has a  Facebook business page  where we have our hours, pictures of our equipment, and a \u201ccheck-in\u201d feature for families who visit. On that page, we have 872 \u201cfans\u201d.\u00a0 Many of them are our customers, many of them are also our donors.\u00a0 We have a very small controlled budget.\u00a0 We are funded only by donations, grants, and the fees that families pay when they visit us.\u00a0 We are playing with other people\u2019s money.\u00a0 We use our Facebook page as it was meant to be : a social media connection to our community.\u00a0 We share our class offerings and our hours, but also inform people of local sensory friendly movies, plays and activities.\u00a0 We built this place to connect families in our area.\u00a0 Because we have little (no) advertising budget, we rely on word of mouth and social media to inform families about us and to stay open.\u00a0 Additionally, we need that online connection to the local businesses and organizations generous enough to support our mission. So when I look and see that only 94 people saw our photo about our free yoga classes for kids with special needs and 303 people saw our post thanking families for joining us for our holiday party?\u00a0 I just don\u2019t get it. Do photos get more or less visibility?\u00a0 Do I share a link in the status or the comments?\u00a0 Do more comments equal more prominence in someone\u2019s newsfeed? Do I write in all caps? I don\u2019t really know what to do here, Facebook. I get that you need to make money.\u00a0 I really do.\u00a0 You\u2019re a business and you\u2019re not the Facebook of five years ago or even two years ago.\u00a0 You have investors to answer to.\u00a0 You have ads to sell.\u00a0 I get that the point is trying to get us to \u201cboost our posts\u201d by paying for it. But we\u2019re not Pepsi with 30 million fans.\u00a0 They have a market they need to target and they have a need to expand their fan base to buy more of their products.\u00a0 They have the money to do it.\u00a0 And yes, I get it.\u00a0 Some bloggers do make money as do some nonprofits.\u00a0 I know that. But I use my blog page and our business page in the same way that I use my personal page. Connection.\u00a0 Community.\u00a0 Communication.\u00a0 We\u2019re not looking for inflated fan numbers to spread our brand.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking to get the information out to the people who chose us and who are truly interested in getting information from us. I will not pay for my blog posts about my son\u2019s great day at school to be seen by more people.\u00a0 Additionally, I can\u2019t in good faith use donations and grant money to boost our business\u2019 posts to let people know when we\u2019re closed for a snow day.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to pay for our fans\u2019 friends to see our latest piece of equipment when they have no interest in our mission.\u00a0 I just need to communicate with the people who actively choose to hear from us.\u00a0  All of the people. So what do I do, Facebook?\u00a0 How can I keep using you in the way I need to?\u00a0 There has to be a way to separate the bloggers from the newspapers, the Wal-Marts from the SenseAbility Gyms.\u00a0 There has to be a way to categorize us differently.\u00a0 Share the algorithms for newsfeed visibility so we know what to do. You need to be transparent for your investors.\u00a0 Be transparent for your users. Help a mom out here, Facebook. My husband told me the other day that people don\u2019t fear change. They fear the uncertainty that comes with change. That\u2019s what I have here, Facebook.\u00a0 I fear losing the community that I worked so hard to build and the business that I have put my heart and soul into creating.\u00a0 These aren\u2019t just online names to us.\u00a0 They are our friends.\u00a0 I need them and they need us. So what do I do? Please don\u2019t say Google+.\u00a0 Please. In the meantime, I\u2019ll remind people that they can follow me on Twitter at  @trydefyinggrav  and  @SenseAbilityGym .\u00a0 I\u2019ll let them know about our day or our latest community project in 140 characters or less.

No strings attached?\u00a0 The answer was an ABSOLUTELY YES AND THANK YOU! And, well, when someone does something that amazing for you, of course I\u2019m going to write about it.\u00a0 I\u2019m a blogger and a business owner.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I do.) The famous Ghandi quote. On the wall in our office at SenseAbility Gym. It\u2019s an interesting journey \u2013 this special needs parenting gig. When you get your child\u2019s diagnosis, whatever it might be, initially you can feel quite alone.\u00a0 You think no one has a kid like mine.\u00a0 No one will understand the challenges he faces.\u00a0 No one knows what he\u2019s feeling or what I\u2019m feeling. And then slowly you find your village.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s in person at the drop off for your child\u2019s special preschool program.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s through a support group.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s online.\u00a0 At some point, you discover that you are not alone and neither is your child.\u00a0 There are people out there who \u201cget it\u201d and will do whatever it takes to help you \u201cget it\u201d too. I\u2019m very lucky to have found my village both in person and online.\u00a0 I have friends who have helped me when I was lost and friends who understand my children better than I do.\u00a0 We have a team of support, not just for me but for our whole family. And it\u2019s because of that support that my friend Tina and I were able to open  our sensory gym .\u00a0 We saw a need and wanted to fill it.\u00a0 We believed in the fact that all children deserved access to the types of therapeutic equipment used in their schools and their private occupational therapy clinics. We wanted the gym to be a place where parents and children could go to socialize with other families who shared similar challenges. To help them find that village. As we started the business, we found that there were other businesses out there with a similar goal. One of these is  Fun and Function . It was started by  Aviva Weiss , an occupational therapist and a mom of six.\u00a0 She was frustrated by the lack of fun toys for children with special needs so she began creating her own.\u00a0 And now she\u2019s on a mission to make \u201cdifferent\u201d play fun. Just like us. Her company contacted me recently with this incredible offer: \u201cAt Fun and Function we believe that special needs children are awesome, and are always on the prowl to connect with likeminded individuals. We would be honored to make a donation to your SenseAbility Gym and we were wondering if there was something in particular that you might have your eye on.\u201d Who does that?\u00a0 Oh right.\u00a0 Companies started by people who \u201cget it\u201d. After saying something like \u201cOh my goodness, thank you!\u00a0 This is huge and amazing!\u201d I asked if there was a way that I could interview Ms. Weiss for our blog. I asked her what inspired her to start the business and where the idea came from.\u00a0 Ms. Weiss answered with a familiar answer \u2013 she was inspired right at home, by her daughter.\u00a0 Her daughter needed the types of equipment for deep pressure and calming, but at the time all she could find were things that were too clinical looking and/or very expensive.\u00a0 She knew she had to change that and knew that if her daughter needed it, there were other kids out there who would need it as well. We talked about the challenges she\u2019s faced along the way and what kept her going.\u00a0 We discussed how hard it is to start your own business, to find the money to do it, to spend your own money to keep things going.\u00a0 But the mission keeps you going \u2013 knowing that you are helping families just like yours. Every word she said rang true for me.\u00a0 It was as if she was saying the words in my head \u2013 all the reasons why we started SenseAbility Gym were the same, all the challenges were the same, and the driving force is the same. I asked the question that many people ask us here \u2013 is there one thing that could help a child with sensory processing disorder?\u00a0 If you could recommend one product, what would it be? She answered with a very familiar answer.\u00a0 There is  no one thing .\u00a0 Every child is different.\u00a0 Every child\u2019s needs are different.\u00a0 And they change.\u00a0 There is no one sensory \u201ctool\u201d that helps every person.\u00a0 \u201cI can tell you what our top sellers are.\u00a0 Things like our weighted compression vests are very popular and have been from the start,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cBut not every child needs every item on this list.\u00a0 It\u2019s why we created the  \u2018Find Your Solution \u2018 filter at the bottom of our website.\u00a0 Parents, caregivers, teachers and adults can enter in their age, budget and need and we\u2019ll help them find the best products for them at the right price.\u201d I asked her what those favorite items were and what were best sellers from the website.\u00a0 She suggested their w eighted compression vest , the  Soft Saddle Scooter ,  Sammy the Seal Swing ,  Social Emotion and Guess How I Feel Games ,  Squishy Gel Cushions ,\u00a0  Cool Chews  and  Bite Bands. Here at SenseAbility Gym, we\u2019re in love with the  Air Lite Junior Bolster Swing .\u00a0 Generously donated to us by Fun and Function. Ms. Weiss and I talked for about 15 minutes until I asked the question that I ask many parents who have older children.\u00a0 What advice do you have for families who are just starting out on this journey? Her answer was the best.\u00a0  Don\u2019t let anyone tell you how to feel or what your child won\u2019t be able to do. It\u2019s okay to grieve and be angry.\u00a0 But then it\u2019s time to get back to figuring out with your child what they need and what can help them.\u00a0 Then anything is possible. Anything is possible.\u00a0 And when you believe in your child and yourself there isn\u2019t anything they \u2013 and you \u2013 can\u2019t do. Like start your own business.\u00a0 Or your build own community. I am so grateful to Aviva Weiss and people like her who have blazed the trail for parents like me. All it takes is an idea and the will to do it. She found her will by looking at her daughter. I found it by looking into these eyes here. Build it and they will come. \u201c I had a lot of good intentions \n  Sit around for fifty years and then collect a pension, \n  Started seeing the road to hell and just where it starts. \n  But my life is more than a vision \n  The sweetest part is acting after making a decision \n  I started seeing the whole as a sum of its parts. \n  My life is part of the global life \n  I\u2019d found myself becoming more immobile \n  When I\u2019d think a little girl in the world can\u2019t do anything. \n  A distant nation my community \n  A street person my responsibility \n  If I have a care in the world I have a gift to bring .\u201d \u2013 Hammer and Nail by Indigo Girls \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.funandfunction.com", "http://www.senseabilitygym.com", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_20130126_145551.jpg", "http://www.senseabilitygym.com", "http://funandfunction.com/", "http://funandfunction.com/about/", "http://funandfunction.com/", "http://funandfunction.com/weighted-compression- vest.html", "http://funandfunction.com/soft-saddle-scooter.html", "http://funandfunction.com/air-litetm-seal-bolster-swingtm.html", "http://funandfunction.com/social-game-combo-pack.html", "http://funandfunction.com/squishy-gel-cushions.html", "http://funandfunction.com/cool-chew-super-pack.html", "http://funandfunction.com/bite-bands.html", "http://funandfunction.com/air-litetm-baby-bolstertm-swing.html", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/1462546_431982386930218_2036950188_o.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/63902_391904270938030_463748395_n.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/hammer-and-nail/", "title": "\n\t\t\tHammer and Nail\t\t"},

You have a million things to do, I get that.\u00a0 But please.\u00a0 Have a seat. I know you\u2019re struggling.\u00a0 I do. I know making that call for an evaluation was hard.\u00a0 Really really hard.\u00a0 You can dismiss it but I know that it took everything you had to do it. The first time you made that call for your older child it might not have been as tough.\u00a0 Maybe your pediatrician suggested it or maybe the school did.\u00a0 You didn\u2019t know what questions you were going to be asked or how much paperwork you would need to fill out.\u00a0 You didn\u2019t know what the appointments were about or how many people would get involved.\u00a0 All you knew then was that people were telling you something was different about your child. This time, though, this time you know.\u00a0 You know that it means hours of paperwork and interviews and testing for your little one.\u00a0 You know what they will ask and how they will ask it, looking at every little milestone under a microscope and questioning every detail of your child\u2019s development. You think you can\u2019t do this again.\u00a0 You think you can\u2019t hear the words again.\u00a0 You think you can\u2019t handle the hours and the logistics and the emotions. But you can. I know because I was there too. It was about 18 months between diagnoses in our house. It took me so long to  pull the trigger on making the appointments for Lewis .\u00a0 I would make the  appointment  and then  cancel .\u00a0 I would stare at the paperwork.\u00a0 I spent so much time looking for \u201c it \u201d \u2013 the something that would be my sign that he was on the spectrum or not.\u00a0 He was so different from Howie.  Early intervention  would come out three times before he was eligible for speech therapy.\u00a0 And in the midst of it all we were working on Howie\u2019s IEP and learning words like PECS and ABA and sensory diet. The day after Lewis was diagnosed with PDD-NOS,  I shared what I friend wrote to me : \u201cOne on the spectrum is one. Two is two. I get that this is a watershed moment. But you know what to do now. You\u2019re already doing it; it\u2019s just a little more weight in your pack. You\u2019ve got this. And you\u2019ve got us.\u201d My friend, I say those words back to you.\u00a0 One kid with a diagnosis is one.\u00a0 Two is two. You\u2019ve got this. I can say this now about 15 months after Lewis\u2019 diagnosis. The teacher meetings are the same.\u00a0 Just times two. The home therapy that was a part of our life with one is now a part of our life with two. And our kids are thriving thanks to early intervention, great teachers and an incredible village of friends. Lewis met almost every goal on his IEP this year.\u00a0 And is meeting every goal in his home therapy. My friend, I know you can do this.\u00a0 I know what a great parent you are. Things are different now. That knowledge that made it so hard to make that phone call in the beginning is now your power. You know that the journey isn\u2019t so scary. You know what to do.\u00a0 You know what questions to ask.\u00a0 You know who to call and where to turn and who has your back. You know this road. And you know you aren\u2019t on it alone.

{"date": "January 10, 2014", "body": "This is a hard one to write. A few days ago, my friend  Jess  met me at the  sensory gym  with her daughter Brooke.\u00a0 It was the last day of our very long holiday break.\u00a0 The exact purpose for the gym unfolded before our eyes as Howie and Brooke played together in the gym space while Jess and I talked. After about 20 minutes of playing and running around, Howie came over to me and climbed into my lap.\u00a0 Jess took out her phone and snapped a few photos.\u00a0 She sent them to me later that afternoon: (photo credit:  Jess ) I spent the rest of that night thinking about those photos. True confession time? When I saw that last picture, my stomach hurt.\u00a0 My heart hurt. I could only see the sensory seeking in this picture. His hand in my hair.\u00a0 Crawling all over me. The constant requests for squishes.\u00a0 Asking to \u201ctunnel\u201d : when he puts his hands on my neck and asks me to press down on his hands with the side of my head.\u00a0 Begging for \u201csnuggles\u201d that aren\u2019t really hugs.\u00a0 The \u201cmom will sit on my feet\u201d demands. I saw a dysregulated kid who had been out of school and out of a routine for too long. I sent Tim this text with the last photo: \u201cJess captured how I spent all of vacation.\u201d \u201cYup.\u201d was the reply back. The following morning, I changed my personal Facebook profile picture to that last photo. The comments I got from friends and family ranged from \u201cLove is\u2026\u201d to \u201cThat is just precious!\u201d to \u201cSo sweet!\u201d And the one that made me cry: \u201cThat\u2019s true love. You being a non-hugger and all \u2013 this is ALL love. Beautiful!\u201d Guilt came flooding in. Everyone else saw love.\u00a0 Affection.\u00a0 Connection. The emotions I didn\u2019t see. I get so wrapped up in everything SPD/autism and looking for the meaning and cause of every single action and reaction\u2026 I sometimes miss the beauty and the \u201cnormalcy\u201d of these moments. Of so. many. moments. Taking him out to shovel the snow is \u201cheavy work\u201d, not just an outside fun activity together. Swinging high on the swings has a purpose, not play. A hug isn\u2019t a hug.\u00a0 It\u2019s a need for deep pressure. Truth is, I\u2019m the only one he will hug and snuggle with like this.\u00a0 He refuses all personal touch from his dad and older brother and relatives.\u00a0 He will squish under blankets and pillows, but skin to skin touch is reserved for me.\u00a0 Has been since he was born. Because I know too much, I saw it as a sensory issue for him. But to everyone else, it\u2019s a loving bond between mother and son. Cue guilt. After reading those comments, I clicked on the photo on my phone and looked at it again. I took a step out of my \u201cautism mom\u201d role and became \u201cMom\u201d. because I needed to look at it again\u2026 In those photos there is the smile.\u00a0 The calm.\u00a0 The love. I can see that\u2019s what Howie sees when he looks at me. This is our connection.\u00a0 Our affection . His safe place.\u00a0 Where he feels the most at peace. I see it all.

{"date": "November 24, 2012", "body": "It started small. I happened to see a post from a business on Facebook that they had entered a contest. A  grant contest . A $25,000 grant contest. From FedEx. My eyes got big. Our nonprofit  SenseAbility Gym  needed that grant. Our community needed that grant. I filled out the online forms and told my business partner Tina about it.\u00a0 I casually mentioned it at our last board of directors meeting.\u00a0 As an aside.\u00a0 Like a \u201cHey, I don\u2019t know how this thing all works, but I filled out the info and we\u2019ll see if we\u2019re accepted.\u201d On November 14, I saw our logo listed on the site.\u00a0 My heart jumped. I shared it with some incredible amazing fantastic wonderful friends.\u00a0 Seriously.\u00a0 There aren\u2019t enough superlatives to describe them. And they got to work.\u00a0 They instantly started sharing the contest and our link on their Facebook pages and Twitter feeds. My friend  Patty\u2019s husband Bil  suggested we create a Facebook event to remind people to vote.\u00a0 He told me to make it public so everyone could see it in their newsfeeds and anyone could invite people to it. My friend  Lexi  blogged about it.\u00a0 Twice. So did my friend  Kristin . Writing things like \u201cAnd parents of ALL these children need and deserve a space that provides all of that for their families,\u00a0and\u00a0arguably more important,\u00a0the community that will inherently come with it.\u201d (from  Kristin ) and \u201d\u00a0Even if it\u2019s not set up in your neck of the country, it could be a model of a gym that could one day be set up near you. If this one is successful, more people will see how incredibly necessary they are.\u201d (from  Lexi ) And my friend Jess, who has been there with the gym from Day One,  wrote about it too .\u00a0 And tweeted:  PLEASE VOTE for @SenseAbilityGym then RT. I\u2019M BEGGING. #fedexgrantcontest  http://bit.ly/XqmY3x  @trydefyinggrav @diaryofamom #autism In her post, Jess  wrote: \u201cPlease vote for them to win the grant. It\u2019s one click, once a day, through Nov 24th. Don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll remind you. But please start right now. One click to create community. That\u2019s all ya gotta do.\u201d So\u2026 What happens when over 2400 people are invited to a Facebook event, and over 400 people actively voting on Facebook, and hundreds of people write Facebook posts daily begging friends to vote (under threat of postings of cat pictures all over their timelines)? What happens when there are many many tweet and retweets,\u00a0 and more postings in Facebook groups and on blog pages asking people to vote for us? What happens when people who don\u2019t even know us invite their Facebook friends to vote for us because they have a child with special needs and believe in our idea? What happens when my son\u2019s first preschool teacher writes to all of her friends: \u201ctoday is the LAST day to vote for this awesome small business started by a good friend of mine! Her son was one of my very first students and holds a special place in my heart\u2026 Just click on the link and vote\u2026thanks!!!!!! :)\u201d What happens when my husband is voting for something through Facebook for the First. Time. Ever? What happens when you add one good idea plus hundreds of incredible friends with amazing social media presence plus a special needs community that comes together to support their own? It equals over 3300 votes for our little nonprofit gym in only ten days . And then this amazing thing happened\u2026this I-can\u2019t-even-put-my-finger-on-it thing\u2026 This\u2026whole community came together. Cheering us on.\u00a0 Joining us as we watched our numbers rise from 500 votes to 1000 votes to 2000 votes to the \u201choly crap we crossed 3000\u201d vote tally. People posting their vote number on our Facebook event page with pride and excitement. This unbelievably dedicated and supportive community grew up around this voting contest. And put us in a position to be in the Top 10 of all the businesses entered. Part of the  mission of our business  is Community .  SenseAbility Gym wants its members to feel welcome, and part of the special needs community. You\u2019ve done that for us 3300 times over now. This grant would be a game changer for us. It would be a game changer for the families in our community. We want the families around us to feel as supported and loved as we have felt over these past 10 days. At 11:59pm Eastern time, voting closes.\u00a0 The contest press release states: \u201cIn December, FedEx will review the entries and select and announce the top 100 finalists based on their contest profile and the number of votes they receive from Facebook users.

{"date": "December 17, 2012", "body": "I wasn\u2019t going to write about Sandy Hook. I couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 For the most part I\u2019ve had to walk away. I haven\u2019t watched TV since Friday.\u00a0 Have filtered my Facebook feed.\u00a0 The harsh reality of the \u201cit could happen anywhere and those children were my child\u2019s age\u201d was just too much to take in. But then today I read this.\u00a0 About Dylan Hockley and his aide Anne Marie Murphy: (from the  New Caanan, CT news ): Staring down the barrel of a rifle,  Anne Marie Murphy  pulled Dylan Hockley close to her, trying to shield him from the hail of bullets that would kill them both. \n Dylan, 6, had special needs, his family said Monday. And Murphy was his \u201camazing\u201d aide, they said. He loved her, pointing happily to her photo on the  Hockley\u2019s  refrigerator every day\u2026 \n \u201cWe cannot speak highly enough of Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach, exceptional women who knew both our children and who specifically helped us navigate Dylan\u2019s special education needs,\u201d Dylan\u2019s parents said. \u201cDylan\u2019s teacher,  Vicki Soto , was warm and funny, and Dylan loved her dearly.\u201d And I was instantly undone. Dylan is the same age as Howie.\u00a0 And in that moment of extreme terror and confusion, he was sheltered and comforted by the person he trusted the most in that school.\u00a0 His aide. This is where it hit so close to home. I know that from the moment Howie gets on the bus until the moment he gets home he has someone with him who cares about his as much as we do. They share in his successes like they are their own and struggle along with him when he is challenged.\u00a0 His teachers \u2013 all of them \u2013 are by his side every moment of the day making sure he is safe and comfortable in his own skin and in his surroundings. I could not send my child to school today or any day if I didn\u2019t have complete trust in them. I cannot imagine the grief that this family is feeling.\u00a0 I write this with tears streaming down my face as I sit next to a sleeping Howie.\u00a0 I watch him dream, so blissfully unaware of what has happened and how everything has changed for so many yet nothing has changed for him.\u00a0 His teachers are keeping it that way. Out there in the world people are angry.\u00a0 There is fighting and name calling over politics and policies and privacy and we are lashing out at one another because there is no one thing to blame so we blame each other. But it should be Dylan\u2019s story to be the story that is shared. The one that reminds us that even in the face of such horror, our kids turn to and are protected by the people that love them. The one that highlights the bond between student and teacher.\u00a0 The teacher that for so many of us special needs parents becomes the caregiver we trust the most.\u00a0 In so many respects, they are their lifeline to the outside world. I want my son\u2019s teachers to know my gratitude for being there for him every moment of the day. To every single one of the teachers and staff who have been my son\u2019s guiding light from the moment he entered school, I am forever grateful for what you\u2019ve given us.

{"date": "November 28, 2012", "body": "This is the story of our dog Rocko. She wasn\u2019t our dog to begin with.\u00a0 My mother, father and sister got her when she was just a few weeks old.\u00a0 She was the smallest dog in the litter and had to stay a while before she could go home with them. Rocko was their fourth dog and the smallest by far.\u00a0 The only full breed.\u00a0 A short-legged short hair Jack Russell Terrier. My sister named her Rocko after the Nickelodeon show \u201c Rocko\u2019s Modern Life \u201c.\u00a0 The main character was named Rocko and he had a dog.\u00a0 My sister just combined the two. She was so tiny.\u00a0 We purchased a cat collar for her and still had to add another hole so it wouldn\u2019t slip off her neck. My dad was getting sicker.\u00a0 In the past, my parents had never let any dog upstairs in the house.\u00a0 But Rocko came up to keep my dad company and slept on his pillow. She liked to burrow and seek our warmth and we\u2019d find her under blankets and in laps.\u00a0 She would just curl up and sleep, resting her head on your feet or your leg. Over the next year my mother and sister got two more dogs, rescuing them from shelters. My dad died the November after they got Rocko. I moved back home.\u00a0 It was my mother, my sister, me and six dogs. As she aged, Rocko became more aggressive towards the other dogs.\u00a0 Apparently this happens sometimes with Jack Russells, but we didn\u2019t know.\u00a0 We spent a lot of time making sure the dogs were separated when we were out. I came home one evening.\u00a0 My mother and sister weren\u2019t there.\u00a0 All I saw was a trail of blood that looked like something out of a horror movie.\u00a0 Somehow the dogs had broken through the gates meant to keep them apart.\u00a0 Rocko had attacked three of the other dogs, two severely.\u00a0 My mother came home and took the injured dogs to the vet.\u00a0 The next day, Rocko went there to be sequestered. She needed to go. I couldn\u2019t take her.\u00a0 I was in the legislature living in a hotel half the year and half the year I was home. Tim and I were dating at the time and in his true white knight fashion he agreed to take her in his house in Massachusetts until we could find a home for her.\u00a0 A \u201cfoster dog\u201d situation. On a cold winter afternoon, I drove her down to be with Tim. I called a bunch of Jack Russell Rescue places.\u00a0 Had a few leads on places with our requirement : no other dogs. But I couldn\u2019t pull the trigger to let her go. So she stayed. For 13 years. There when I moved in\u2026 There when we got married\u2026 And there through the arrival of all three of our children. Pregnant with baby number one Rocko would sleep wherever we were but she was particularly fond of under the covers at the foot of our bed.\u00a0 Until I found a tick in our bed and moved her on top of the covers under her own special blanket. She was part of my favorite new parent story ever.\u00a0 Gerry was a terrible sleeper when he was a baby.\u00a0 I had finally nursed him back to sleep after a long middle of the night awake stretch.\u00a0 He had fallen asleep on my arm and I had to pee. Not wanting to move him, I wriggled out of my nightgown and went to the bathroom naked.\u00a0 I tip-toed quietly to the bathroom, did what I needed to do, and walked quietly into the dark.\u00a0 As I made my way to the bed I heard a huge  THUD . I screamed and flipped the light on, thinking it was Gerry falling off the bed. It was Rocko hopping down to find me. Staring at naked me in the bright light was Tim and now a wide awake \u2013 and now crying \u2013 Gerry. She is also part of one of my scarier moments as a parent.\u00a0 A now toddler aged Gerry was jumping around on our bed and landed on her tail.\u00a0 Rocko turned around and snapped at him.\u00a0 Not biting, but enough of a reaction that we started the search again for another home for her.\u00a0 Again, we couldn\u2019t pull the trigger.\u00a0 But for the next seven years, she was never left alone with any of the kids.\u00a0 And she never slept on the bed again. ********** We said goodbye to Rocko last week. She had dementia. She would sleep all day and walk around all night. She had \u201cdry eyes\u201d meaning her eyes didn\u2019t produce tears.\u00a0 For several years Tim put drops in her eyes to ease the pain, but she was now completely blind. And deaf. She had fallen down the stairs too many times because she couldn\u2019t see. She slept on Tim\u2019s side of the bed on the carpet under his nightstand and never left that spot. We carried her out to pee. And even then she would pee or throw up in the house.\u00a0 She peed on her water bowl and barely ate. She didn\u2019t know when we were there or even sensed where we were. She was getting worse. I shook the whole time that Tim was away with her at the vet. We know she went peacefully. Her last picture. Excuse my knee in the way. ********** When Tim got home and the kids were asleep, I sat down with him on the couch and sobbed.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t even know these tears existed for her. \u201cIt\u2019s like I have nothing left of him now,\u201d I cried into Tim\u2019s lap.\u00a0 \u201cI have the  green chair  and the  coat  and that\u2019s it.\u00a0 That dog\u2026she\u2026\u201d I just curled up in Tim\u2019s arms and cried.\u00a0 Just as I had 14 years ago at the cemetery after burying my dad. \u201cWe\u2019re never getting rid of that chair, are we?\u201d Tim said. I shook my head no and laughed through the tears. \u201cI loved her too, you know.\u201d Tim said quietly.\u00a0 He had been her primary caregiver for 13 years now.\u00a0 As we had more children, more dog responsibilities fell to him.\u00a0 This was his pain as much as mine.\u00a0 We sat together on the couch quietly remembering Rocko. ********** Telling the kids was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve done as a parent. I googled \u201chow to tell your autistic child about the death of a pet\u201d and didn\u2019t get much.\u00a0 The \u201cRainbow Bridge\u201d poem just doesn\u2019t work for our not very religious, incredibly literal family. So we told them the truth. Their reactions matched their personalities exactly. Gerry said he wished he didn\u2019t have feelings so it didn\u2019t hurt so much.\u00a0 Howie went between being very sad and saying \u201cpoor Rocko\u201d and then saying he was happy he wouldn\u2019t be annoyed by her toenails clicking on the floor anymore.\u00a0 Lewis got very very sad and kept saying \u201cI am sad that Rocko died.\u201d They all wanted another dog instantly. This will be a process.\u00a0 For us all. ********** Goodbye Rocko. You weren\u2019t a great dog. But you were our dog. Our memory dog. I slipped your collar into the pocket of Dad\u2019s coat. We will miss you. A huge thank you to the incredible doctor at the Northern RI Animal Hospital for being there for us all.

{"date": "January 8, 2013", "body": "Self-advocacy. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about self-advocacy and how it could fit for Howie. I read  Jess\u2019 brilliant piece at Diary of a Mom about her daughter Brooke and her participation in her IEP meeting  and I sat there trying to think of ways that Howie could start to participate.  Ways for him to feel included in how his school plans are made. Wondering how, at age six, it could work for Howie. He\u2019s always been very good at expressing to others his joy or dislike for certain activities, whether it be through his words or through his behavior. In fact, when he transitioned from preschool to kindergarten, his teachers and aides all said \u201cJust give Howie a minute to tell you his side. You may not agree with him, but if he feels like you heard him, he\u2019ll be more likely to figure out the solution together.\u201d This year, the toughest part of the day for Howie is his \u201cFundations\u201d class.  It\u2019s the spelling/language arts lesson.  It\u2019s mid-morning, and he moves into a different classroom for the lesson.  Howie is in a 1st/2nd grade combined class.  For the Fundations lesson, the first graders move next door to work with other first grade kids, and the second grade kids stay in his classroom and are joined by other second graders. I know it sounds complicated, but it works.  But for Howie there are several things at play: a different teacher, a different classroom, different kids and a subject that is clearly \u201cnon-preferred\u201d. It\u2019s not that he can\u2019t do the work, he just doesn\u2019t like it. From the beginning of school this year, it\u2019s the one real bumpy part of the day. He knows when it\u2019s coming at 9:30 and his behavior and anxiety starts to amp up.  Many mornings, he\u2019s had to leave the classroom and do his Fundations lessons in the smaller sub-separate classroom away from his peers. Which would be fine if that\u2019s what he needed.  But what he really wants \u2013 and needs \u2013 is to be a part of the larger group as much as possible to get the full lesson and work with his peers. I\u2019ve done a lot of brainstorming with his teachers about it \u2013 incentives, plans, etc. None of our ideas seem to stick. Turns out, the ideas had to come from him. When Howie returned to school after winter break, he sat down with one of his aides to talk about Fundations.  He was perseverating on the fact that it was boring and that he thought he had to say \u201cA \u2013 Apple \u2013 A\u201d each time (practicing letter sounds).  I got a note home that they had created a social story to help him get through the lesson. \u201cHow to Stay in Fundations\u201d by Howie His teachers sent a copy of it home so I could see it and we could talk about it. I thought his teachers wrote it and shared it with Howie. Turns out, Howie wrote this all by himself. Since writing this social story, Howie has been able to not only sit through the whole Fundations lesson, but be an active participant with his peers. So at the very moment that I was trying to figure out how to help Howie participate more, he was doing it himself. Slightly ironic, no? I know this is just the beginning of this for him.  That the more he understands his body and his brain, the more he\u2019ll be the one to express what he needs. Because it really should come from him, right?

Monday was library day and Howie renewed his book about boats.

{"date": "January 28, 2014", "body": "A few weeks ago, we got our notice for our annual IEP meeting for Howie. And just like every other notice we\u2019ve received for the past five years, this one included a one page purple sheet addressed to us as parents: Please take a few moments to respond to the following questions.\u00a0 Please return this completed sheet in the enclosed envelope.\u00a0 Your comments will help the whole team develop an appropriate education program for your child. \n 1. What concerns do you, the parent (and student fourteen years of age or older) want to see addressed in the student\u2019s educational program? \n 2. What are the student\u2019s educational strengths, areas of interest, significant personal attributes, and personal accomplishments? \n 3. What is your vision for your child?\u00a0 What would you like your child to be able to do within the next 1-3 years?\u00a0 Beginning at age 14, think about your child\u2019s preferences and interest.\u00a0 Also think about desired outcomes in adult living, post secondary and working environments. I\u2019ve always taken these very seriously.\u00a0 I return them every year with long detailed responses to each question, usually going on to the backside of the paper.\u00a0 I felt like if they were asking, I was going to answer. I sat with the sheet in front of me for a while.\u00a0 I thought about how this whole year we\u2019ve been working with Howie to help him identify his sensory needs and coping skills to help him stay in the classroom when he can, but also know when he can\u2019t be there.\u00a0 And to know that that\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve talked about him being his best advocate and using his words to explain what he\u2019s thinking and feeling in the moment.\u00a0 And working with his team to respect that and to really listen to what he\u2019s saying. For the first question\u2026well I decided the best person to ask was Howie himself.\u00a0 Waiting until he was fourteen didn\u2019t make any sense.\u00a0 So I asked him to tell me what was hard for him.\u00a0 We talked about the times when he gets stressed and what calms him down.\u00a0 I translated it into five issues we\u2019d like addressed in this year\u2019s program: 1) anxiety and stress in academics addressed through accommodations (specifically during time tests, reading out loud to peers, patience with learning new topics) \n 2) access to new sensory tools and accommodations for individual/group work (scribe, extended time, ability to type answers) \n 3) work on social/emotional regulation within the classroom space \n 4) development of self-advocacy skills \n 5) implementation of programs to work on rules/consequences and taking responsibility for his action. My answer to the second question remained pretty consistent from the past five years.\u00a0 I wrote that he\u2019s very bright \u2013 strong in science and math concepts and loves social studies and history.\u00a0 He loves to read on his own terms and enjoys project time and projects with some structure but without too many constraints.\u00a0 He likes to feel like he\u2019s the teacher and loves feeling popular in his class. It was the vision question that made me stop for a very long time. My vision statement for the past four years was this: We want Howie to show what he could do academically without his behaviors getting in the way. I read that now and I cringe. I don\u2019t even want to write that here.\u00a0 But truth is that in the beginning I didn\u2019t know what I know now.\u00a0 I desperately wanted his teachers and the staff to see the bright incredible boy that I saw.\u00a0 My concerns \u2013 my fears \u2013 were that they would never see that he had this incredible brain, a wicked sense of humor, and they would never know that he could read and write and draw just like every other kid in the class. I thought that his \u201cbehaviors\u201d would keep him out of the classroom and away from the things that he excelled at.\u00a0  I didn\u2019t know what the behaviors meant.\u00a0 That they weren\u2019t something to extinguish.\u00a0 That we couldn\u2019t \u201ccompliance training\u201d them away. \n Now I know. I know that behavior is communication.\u00a0 I know that stimming is not only okay, but necessary. I know the importance of learning how sensory and calming strategies work in different situations.\u00a0 I know to look at my kid as my kid \u2013 not a series of antecedents, triggers, and behavior plans.\u00a0 I know now to respect what he\u2019s doing and listen to what he\u2019s saying because by doing that \u2013 that\u2019s how he achieves success.\u00a0 Academically, socially and emotionally. He has that success now with his current teacher and aides.\u00a0 Educators who look at him as an individual and work with his strengths to overcome his challenges. It was time to put all that into writing. What is my vision for my child? We would like Howie to be happy and enjoy school and learning in a classroom environment that meets and supports his needs.\u00a0 This means helping him become a better self-advocate while creating a program that fits his individual strengths and challenges, with accommodations and supports necessary for academic, social and emotional success. On Monday, we will sit down with his whole team and write an IEP that does just this. As we write objectives for pragmatics, sensorimotor breaks, and social/emotional growth,\u00a0 the major thread through it all will be to\u00a0 help him find ways to feel good and comfortable in his own skin, to feel respected for his differences, to advocate for himself and to \u2013 plain and simple \u2013 be happy. That\u2019s how he\u2019ll show them what he can do. By being himself. \u201c See my reflection change \n  Nothing ever stays the same \n  But you know the names The Game \n  We don\u2019t know what it means \n  Nothing\u2019s ever what it seems \n  Unforgiven\u2026unforseen  I see the line in the sand \n  Time to find out, who I am \n  Looking back to see where I stand \n  Evolution, Evolutio n\u201d \u2013 Evolution by Motorhead \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/photo19.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2014/01/28/evolution/", "title": "\n\t\t\tEvolution\t\t"},

Second note:\u00a0 While this is part one, the story actually comes after parts two and three chronologically.\u00a0 But I felt like I had to share this one first.\u00a0 I hope it makes sense in the long run. I was finishing up at work tonight while Howie was playing on the iPad.\u00a0 He was with me tonight as he is most nights that I\u2019m at the sensory gym. I closed up the computer and it made that whirring noise that laptops make as they wind down to hibernate. \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d Howie asked.\u00a0 \u201cThe one that sounds like\u2026\u201d and he mimicked the noise perfectly. \u201cAh,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s the computer shutting down.\u00a0 You made that sound exactly right.\u201d I paused for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been good at that,\u201d I told him.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s all part of that amazing brain of yours.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s in my soul.\u201d he said. \u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d \u201cMy gift.\u00a0 It\u2019s in my soul. It will always be a part of me.\u201d I stared at him from across the room.\u00a0 He never looked up from his iPad the whole time.\u00a0 But his words moved me to my core. This incredible child of mine.\u00a0 He knows what he has is special.\u00a0 Different not less. \u201cYou\u2019ve had that gift since you were born you know,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cLike that song \u2018Born This Way.\u201d He gave a little chuckle.\u00a0 \u201cOh yeah.\u00a0 It is like the song.\u201d And while maneuvering around his Minecraft world he quietly sang \u201cYou\u2019re on the right track baby you were born this way.\u201d I walked over to him and gently kissed him on the cheek. \u201cI love you sweetie.\u00a0 And that amazing brain of yours.\u201d A smile. \u201cWanna see my minecart move on the tracks?\u201d Yes.\u00a0 Yes I do. \u201c There\u2019s nothin\u2019 wrong with lovin\u2019 who you are \n  She said, \u2019cause He made you perfect, babe \n  So hold your head up, \n  girl and you\u2019ll go far \n  Listen to me when I say I\u2019m beautiful in my way \n  \u2018Cause God makes no mistakes \n  I\u2019m on the right track, baby \n  I was born this way \u201d \u2013 Born This Way by Lady Gaga Parts Two and Three (which are really parts one and two) about how Howie learned about autism are coming soon\u2026 \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/holidaycard51.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/born-this-way-part-one/", "title": "\n\t\t\tBorn This Way (part\u00a0one)\t\t"},

Second note:\u00a0 While this is part two, the story actually happened first \u2013 before part one.\u00a0 But it took me a long time to get the words together for this part of the story.\u00a0 I am hoping the order makes sense some day. \n It was a Sunday morning a few weeks ago.\u00a0 Howie and I were headed out.\u00a0 It\u2019s a work day for me and it\u2019s our Sunday tradition that he comes with me. He stopped short in the garage and said \u201cHey!\u00a0 That\u2019s not right!\u201d I turned to see what he was looking at.\u00a0 It was his snow shovel.\u00a0 On it there\u2019s a picture of a snowman saying \u201cBrrr!\u201d and he\u2019s surrounded by four drawings of snowflakes. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked. \u201cAll the snowflakes on that shovel are exactly the same.\u00a0 That\u2019s not right.\u00a0 Every snowflake is different.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d I said.\u00a0 I looked over at the shovel.\u00a0 \u201cI would have never seen that.\u201d \u201cI notice stuff like that.\u201d he said. I opened up the car door and helped him buckle his seat belt.\u00a0 He\u2019s getting faster at doing it himself, but when he\u2019s thinking of other things the motor planning involved with buckling just doesn\u2019t come as easily. \u201cYes, you do notice stuff like that,\u201d I said. \u201cYou always have.\u00a0 You have a brain that sees things that others don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d he said.\u00a0 And he named other things he notices.\u00a0 Details on letters with different fonts.\u00a0 Things that are just slightly out of place. I pulled out of the driveway while he was talking. \u201cDoes that make me a mutant?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat? No!\u201d I looked at his face in the rear view mirror as he looked a little crestfallen. Ah, like the X-Men\u2026we\u2019re in  superhero  mode again. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the  only  one in the world with that kind of brain.\u00a0 But most people don\u2019t.\u201d Smiles from the back seat. I realized that this was the time. I have spent the days since that moment we got Howie\u2019s autism diagnosis in December 2009 wondering how I would talk to Howie about his autism.\u00a0 I rehearsed it in my head many times.\u00a0 Bought books.\u00a0 Read blog posts.\u00a0 Wanted to make sure I did it \u201cright\u201d. We stopped at a light. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cThat ability is a gift.\u201d \u201cIt is?\u201d \u201cYes.\u00a0 You know what I mean by \u2018gift\u2019, right?\u00a0 Not like a birthday party gift but more like a talent.\u00a0 Something special you have.\u201d \u201cI  know ! What is it? What\u2019s it called?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s called autism.\u201d \u201cSo I have autism?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHmmmm.\u201d I decided to push it a little bit more. \u201cHey, you know who else has a gift for seeing stuff like that?\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d he asked. \u201cYour friend  Brooke .\u201d \u201cBrooke has autism?\u201d AND THE BIGGEST SMILE FILLED UP MY REAR VIEW MIRROR. I left the words hanging there for a moment as I turn into the parking lot for the sensory gym. \u201cMom?\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d \u201cCan I have the iPad?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u00a0 Once we\u2019re inside.\u201d And we were done. ********** A totally easy conversation about something not so easy. I relayed the conversation to my friend Jess  later on that morning, partly because it was through her words and guidance that I was even able to have that conversation that way, but also to thank her and Brooke for giving me the permission to share with Howie. She texted me back with \u201c You know what makes these conversations so hard? US.\u201d How true is that? I wrote \u201c It was just so natural as a progression from him seeing something no one else would ever notice\u2026 I figured it was a good moment to call it and not a challenging moment.\u201d \n That is where Howie and I left it that morning.\u00a0\u00a0 His autism is his gift.\u00a0 He knows that his brain works differently than others.\u00a0 He knows that it means he can smell things more intensely than others, that he can create things in his head and make them come to life, that he can interpret the world in a way that is uniquely his. And he\u2019s knows he\u2019s not alone.\u00a0 Knowing that he has a friend whose brain works a little differently is so important.\u00a0 We\u2019ve talked some more about other kids we know who are autistic and each time a smile fills the room. At some point I know we\u2019ll have to talk about the challenges that autism brings.\u00a0 Because that is as important as knowing the strengths. Part of understanding his differences is knowing that the sensory issues, the difficult time sitting still, the frustration over school projects and social interactions, and the perseverations \u2013 these are not because he\u2019s not smart or incapable.\u00a0\u00a0 Actually just the opposite.\u00a0 Knowing that his brain works differently will help him understand that his aides in school are there not as a crutch or punishment but as a tool for support, just like his sensory tool box.\u00a0 He needs to know that it\u2019s okay to ask to leave the room when he can\u2019t concentrate, and that it\u2019s okay to ask for help not because he can\u2019t do it but because he needs to frame it in a way that works for his unique brain. But we aren\u2019t at that point yet.\u00a0 That conversation will come \u2013 it may be next week or next month or next year.\u00a0 What I know now is that I can\u2019t plan it.\u00a0 It has to fit the time and place with no script or plan. Unique to him.\u00a0 Just like the snowflake that he is. my favorite holiday present ever. Howie\u2019s teacher made a snow globe with his picture inside.

{"date": "February 9, 2014", "body": "Note: As I wrote in  part one  and in part  two , I asked Howie if I could share this story here.\u00a0 I told him that I had a blog and that I liked to write about things that happen in our lives on it.\u00a0 His response?\u00a0 \u201cSure.\u00a0 You can share this with the blogosphere.\u201d\u00a0 Well, okay then.\u00a0 And this time, I asked all three boys if it was okay to share the story. \n Chronologically, part three came after part two but before part one.\u00a0 But this is how it all came out here. Over the past few weeks since the \u201c big \u201d conversation that wasn\u2019t so big, Howie and I have been talking a lot about autism.\u00a0 It\u2019s not hard to bring it up \u2013 at the  sensory gym  we have a community bulletin board with information from our local autism resource center, the  Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation for Autism , and  Birdhouse for Autism  (an app and web based application for tracking therapies, medications, sleep and anything and everything related to a child\u2019s well being). So the word comes up whenever we\u2019re there. But it had always remained between us. We\u2019ve also had some discussions about other kids we knew who were autistic.\u00a0 Friends who had given us permission to share that information.\u00a0 Each time, it was met with a smile. Yet for some reason, I never mentioned the fact that his younger brother was autistic too.\u00a0 Again, this is on me.\u00a0 In my head I still thought there had to be the right time and place to talk about it.\u00a0 That Lewis should know first.\u00a0 Or there had to be some specific chain of events to make it \u201cthe right way\u201d. Apparently, I don\u2019t learn my own lessons. Two weekends ago, all three kids were sitting at the kitchen table.\u00a0 We were listening to music and the boys were talking about whether or not they had good hearing.\u00a0 Gerry said that our whole family had bad hearing.\u00a0 Before I could step in and protest with my expert hearing skills, Howie said \u201cNo, I have super hearing.\u00a0 I can hear and see things that others can\u2019t. I have what\u2019s that word again?\u201d He paused. \u201cOh yeah.\u00a0 I have au-TIS-m.\u201d (so yes, the accent is on the wrong syl-LA-ble.\u00a0 But still.) Gerry looked over at me and didn\u2019t say a word.\u00a0 Neither did I. \u201cI have autism,\u201d said Lewis matter-of-factly.\u00a0 \u201cI just have clogged ears.\u201d Howie looked at him and said, \u201cYou have autism too?\u00a0 Well, you do have a super memory.\u00a0 You know the whole grid of the Marvel Super Heroes characters on the Playstation game.\u201d \u201cYup,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cLewis has autism just like you, Howie.\u201d \u201cDoes our whole family have autism?\u201d Howie asked. \u201cNo. \u201d I said. Gerry looked at me and quietly asked, \u201cDo I have autism?\u201d I shook my head no. And that is how Lewis found out that he was autistic too. No big reveal. No grand plan. Just \u201cyup, you\u2019re autistic.\u201d Gerry got up from the table to get some more milk.\u00a0 I pulled him aside for a moment. I thought back to a  conversation that Gerry and I had almost two years ago to the day : \u201cDon\u2019t you think he should know about his autism?\u00a0 So he understands?\u00a0 I know most of his friends are from his school and are like him, so that\u2019s really good.\u00a0 But at some point, shouldn\u2019t he know?\u00a0 Because really?\u00a0 Sometimes it\u2019s very stressful for me that I know but he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 His eyes teared up a little. \n I knew I had to choose my words very carefully here.\u00a0 This\u2026was important. \n \u201cYes, of course he needs to know.\u00a0 Dad and I just have to figure out the right time.\u00a0 He\u2019s only five.\u201d \n \u201cDo you have friends who have kids with special needs?\u00a0 Kids who are older?\u00a0 Can\u2019t you ask them when they told their kids?\u201d \n And then my kid wows me.\u00a0  Again . \n \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not fair.\u00a0 All his timeouts.\u00a0 At first I thought they were good.\u00a0 Teaching him.\u00a0 But if he can\u2019t help it, then the timeouts aren\u2019t fair, are they? It\u2019s like if you\u2019re driving and your car\u2019s wheels lock up.\u00a0 And you hit something and cause a lot of damage.\u00a0 It\u2019s not your fault that the car didn\u2019t work the way it should.\u00a0 Right?\u201d \n I\u2019m in awe of this kid.\u00a0 Of how much he loves his brother.\u00a0 Of how much he gets it. \n \u201cMom.\u00a0 Shouldn\u2019t he know so he understands?\u201d I touched Gerry\u2019s arm and brought him into the other room. \u201cYou remember you wanted me to tell Howie that he was autistic?\u00a0 Well, I did.\u201d He looked right at me. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said. ********** Since then, the topic has come up quite a bit.\u00a0 My boys \u2013 all three of them \u2013 are attempting to understand what autism means to them and for them.\u00a0 There have been attempts at one upping each other with \u201cwell, my autism means I can hear the grass grow!\u201d and it makes for a good discussion about how brains work and no, you can\u2019t really hear the grass grow. In quizzing Howie if he washed his hands, he told me that only someone with autism could have good enough smelling to smell how clean his hands are. Then there was Howie\u2019s question to me one morning at 5am: if everyone in the world had autism, does that mean no one in the world has autism? For which I had absolutely no answer. Just this afternoon came \u201cIs autism sensory?\u201d And of course there was the moment when he told me  his gift was part of his soul . When he realized he was born this way. But my favorite comment came from Gerry last week.\u00a0 We were talking about how all of us in the family have brains that work differently. It\u2019s important to know that and understand why so instead of getting frustrated and struggling with the things that are hard for us, we can acknowledge the challenges and use our strengths to cope with them. We talked about what I wrote in part two: \n \u201cAt some point I know we\u2019ll have to talk about the challenges that autism brings.\u00a0 Because that is as important as knowing the strengths. Part of understanding his differences is knowing that the sensory issues, the difficult time sitting still, the frustration over school projects and social interactions, and the perseverations \u2013 these are not because he\u2019s not smart or incapable. \u201c \n I told him that this was why right now we\u2019re focusing on positives that come with autism for Howie. \u201cI like that,\u201d Gerry said. \u201cI like that he looks it like it\u2019s his superpower.\u201d Me too.\u00a0 Me too. my three superheroes \u201c My mama told me when I was young \n  We are all born superstars \n  She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on \n  In the glass of her boudoir  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with loving who you are \n  She said, \u201c\u2018Cause He made you perfect, babe\u201d \n  \u201cSo hold your head up girl and you\u2019ll go far, \n  Listen to me when I say\u201d  I\u2019m beautiful in my way \n  \u2018Cause God makes no mistakes \n  I\u2019m on the right track, baby \n  I was born this way \n  Don\u2019t hide yourself in regret \n  Just love yourself and you\u2019re set \n  I\u2019m on the right track, baby \n  I was born this way \u201d \u2013 Born This Way by Lady Gaga For a great way to talk about autism with your child (or to learn more yourself), check out this great booklet from The Autism NOW Center and The Autistic Self Advocacy Network at  http://autismnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Welcome-to-the-Autistic-Community-Adolescent.pdf \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/born-this-way-part-one/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2014/02/05/born-this-way-part-two/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2014/02/05/born-this-way-part-two/", "http://www.senseabilitygym.com", "http://www.dougflutiejrfoundation.org/", "http://www.birdhousehq.com/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/the-obvious-child/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/12/11/he-aint-heavy-hes-my-brother/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/born-this-way-part-one/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/537237_10201102946202412_114588230_n-2.jpg", "http://autismnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Welcome-to-the-Autistic-Community-Adolescent.pdf"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2014/02/09/born-this-way-part-three/", "title": "\n\t\t\tBorn This Way (part\u00a0three)\t\t"},

Lewis ********** Note in Howie\u2019s log book last week from one of his 1:1 aides: \u201cAfter social group Howie insisted on flapping his arms.\u00a0 The group was not at all overly stimulating or excitable.\u00a0 When I talked to (him) about this he said \u2018sometimes autistic people have to do that thing.\u2019 I said \u2018stimming\u2019? And he said \u2018yes I need to stim and flap my arms\u2019\u2026he said sometimes he needs to flap if he\u2019s excited.\u201d ********** Howie had his eighth birthday party two weeks ago.\u00a0 We invited his whole class because, well, because.\u00a0 I could give you some reason like making sure to include everyone but truthfully there wasn\u2019t anyone he thought he couldn\u2019t invite. He\u2019s been with most of the kids for two years and he really wanted them all at his party. We did one of those indoor trampoline places parties because where else can you go with 28 2nd graders and contain them all? I was nervous of course.\u00a0 I don\u2019t get to see how kids interact with Howie except for a few moments here and there.\u00a0 I get the log book notes and information from teacher meetings, but I never see it with my own eyes.\u00a0 I watched these kids interact with him \u2013 seek him out \u2013 not just because it was his birthday but because they care about him.\u00a0 They told inside jokes on the bench as they waited for their jump turn.\u00a0 They checked in on him when they were jumping. They jostled for position around him for cake. When we got home and settled in, Howie opened his presents.\u00a0 Some cards were on green construction paper (his favorite color).\u00a0 Some cards had his special \u201cHero Howie\u201d symbol on them.\u00a0 All of the cards had special note, poem, story, or picture drawn just for him about him.\u00a0 Every present was something he wanted that he didn\u2019t already have.\u00a0 I asked Howie how the kids knew.\u00a0 \u201cThey asked me in school and I told them.\u201d he said matter-of-factly.\u00a0 Well of course. That night I sent his teacher some pictures from the party with the note: \u201cAll those kids are quite incredible and so so good to Howie. They knew what he liked and how to interact with him.\u00a0 That is all because of you. Thank you for creating a classroom and a space that allowed my kid to have his real big first friend party. You sure I can\u2019t convince you to teach third grade? :)\u201d His fabulous teacher wrote back: \u201cThey absolutely adore him and are really cheering for him each and every day. \u00a0I\u2019m so glad to hear that the party went well!\u201d ********** Note in Howie\u2019s log book three weeks ago from his other 1:1 aide (paraphrasing): \u201cHowie seemed to be having a hard time with his shirt.\u00a0 It was making him uncomfortable all day and he couldn\u2019t focus.\u00a0 We sat and talked about the things that I am bothered by and he was able to work through it.\u00a0 It really seems to help him when others connect with him about sensory issues.\u201d ********** From my blog post \u201c Born This Way part two \u201c: I have spent the days since that moment we got Howie\u2019s autism diagnosis in December 2009 wondering how I would talk to Howie about his autism.\u00a0 I rehearsed it in my head many times.\u00a0 Bought books.\u00a0 Read blog posts.\u00a0 Wanted to make sure I did it \u201cright\u201d. \n We stopped at a light. \n \u201cSo\u2026\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cThat ability is a gift.\u201d \n \u201cIt is?\u201d \n \u201cYes.\u00a0 You know what I mean by \u2018gift\u2019, right?\u00a0 Not like a birthday party gift but more like a talent.\u00a0 Something special you have.\u201d \n \u201cI  know ! What is it? What\u2019s it called?\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s called autism.\u201d \n \u201cSo I have autism?\u201d \n \u201cYes.\u201d \n \u201cHmmmm.\u201d \n I decided to push it a little bit more. \n \u201cHey, you know who else has a gift for seeing stuff like that?\u201d \n \u201cWho?\u201d he asked. \n \u201cYour friend  Brooke .\u201d \n \u201cBrooke has autism?\u201d \n AND THE BIGGEST SMILE FILLED UP MY REAR VIEW MIRROR. ********** For some April is about Autism Awareness.\u00a0 And that\u2019s fine and good and it\u2019s what works for them. In our house, though, this month (and every month) is about autism connection. According to the experts, that\u2019s supposed to be something that my boys can\u2019t do, right? Connect with others. How wrong could they be? I see connection every day with my kids \u2013 between teacher and student, between classmates and friends, brother to brother, and parent to child. I see it in the children who come to our sensory gym. When families are given the safe space (physically and emotionally) for their kids to play, relationships and playdates and connections blossom. For us- for my boys, for me as their parent, this month is about connecting\u00a0 to find that piece \u2013 that tie that binds \u2013 to make one feel less alone.\u00a0 To make one feel part of a community. And for helping the world understand that community, one conversation at a time. ********** From my personal Facebook status on March 31st: \u201c When Howie is feeling \u201cout of sorts\u201d, he often asks for a \u201cmom squish\u201d. Probably because I am the squishiest of the bunch. \n Tonight, I was complaining that my back hurt as I sat down crooked on the couch. He came over to me, looked me righ t in the eye, and said \u201cdo you need a Howie squish?\u201d It\u2019s the eve of Autism Awareness Month and every day my kids smash and crash their way through every stereotype and every myth. But in our house it\u2019s not about awareness. I want them to know that they are accepted, understood, and loved for who they are. And those Howie squishes? They make all the aches and pains go away.\u201d Happy Autism Connection Month. \u00a0 \u201c Why are there so many songs about rainbows \n  and what\u2019s on the other side? \n  Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, \n  and rainbows have nothing to hide. \n  So we\u2019ve been told and some choose to believe it. \n  I know they\u2019re wrong, wait and see. \n  Someday we\u2019ll find it, the rainbow connection. \n  The lovers, the dreamers and me.  Who said that every wish would be heard \n  and answered when wished on the morning star? \n  Somebody thought of that and someone believed it. \n  Look what it\u2019s done so far. \n  What\u2019s so amazing that keeps us star gazing \n  and what do we think we might see? \n  Someday we\u2019ll find it, the rainbow connection. \n  The lovers, the dreamers and me.  All of us under its spell. We know that it\u2019s probably magic.  Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices? \n  I\u2019ve heard them calling my name. \n  Is this the sweet sound that called the young sailors. \n  The voice might be one and the same. \n  I\u2019ve heard it too many times to ignore it. \n  It\u2019s something that I\u2019m supposed to be. \n  Someday we\u2019ll find it, the rainbow connection. \n  The lovers, the dreamers and me . \u201d \u2013 The Rainbow Connection by Kermit the Frog A great way to be part of the conversation is to purchase one of these # wearthechange  shirts created by my friend  Jess .\u00a0 Through the month of April, the net proceeds from these shirts will be split three ways with the  Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation for Autism ,  The Autistic Self Advocacy Network , and my nonprofit  SenseAbility Gym .

{"date": "April 26, 2014", "body": "A few years before I got married I worked in college admissions for a small women\u2019s college in Vermont. The students that applied mostly came from the Northeast and for many of them they were first generation college students. I remember a conversation I had with my friend, the assistant director of admissions. We were talking about a potential student who we knew would be a great fit for the school but hadn\u2019t sent in her deposit yet. The assistant director had multiple conversations with the young woman. Finally, the applicant said \u201cI want to come to your school. I just can\u2019t put pen to paper to send in what I need to.\u201d It\u2019s a sentence that stuck with me for some reason. Maybe it was the clever use of words to describe the difficulty in getting an idea out of her head and putting it out there for others to see. Maybe I just admired her honesty. Whatever it was it\u2019s a phrase I\u2019ve used often now as a parent when describing Howie\u2019s difficulties in school. ********** It was vacation week this week and Howie needed to catch up on some work from school. He had begun to check out about a week before vacation started and work wasn\u2019t getting finished. Yesterday morning he came to work with me and with a lot of reinforcers, we got down to work. He was working really hard on a math sheet consisting of addition and subtraction of three digit numbers. He was concentrating really hard on watching the signs and borrowing or carrying when necessary. After every question he asked for a  mom squish . With about six questions to go, he put his pencil down. \u201cMy brain is buzzing!\u201d I looked at him. His body was slumped in his chair. He was spent. \u201cYour brain is buzzing?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d \u201cIt means my brain is buzzing. Can I be done?\u201d I decided to push a little bit. \u201cWe can be done with this one. But let\u2019s do a few more smaller problems and then we will be completely done.\u201d\u00a0 He had one sheet of single digit subtraction with a few problems left to complete. \u201cOkay.\u201d He said quietly. He did the ones I asked. \u201cNow can I be done?\u201d \u201cYup. Nice job!\u201d He took out his iPad and began to play his Blocksworld app. \u201cHey \u2013 does your brain buzz like that a lot?\u201d \u201cSometimes,\u201d he answered. He looked up briefly at the original three digit math sheet. \u201cWhen I do work like that.\u201d \n working hard \n ********** \n It\u2019s clear his frustration level comes from not being able to get the answer out of his brain. In school he uses phrases like \u201cMrs C! I have butterflies in my brain\u201d when he\u2019s asked reading comprehension questions and he starts to shut down. He can only complete three out of six rows of a subtraction math test in the allotted time.\u00a0 When questions are modified or time restrictions are removed, he can get the answers correct. It just takes a teacher willing to sit and connect with him. Or help him get pen to paper. \n He knows his stuff. He can read and answer questions about the book when it\u2019s something he\u2019s interested in. He can apply math concepts to real life situations and when given his time and his space he can do word problems and regular math problems. In his way. \n ********** \n In the middle of vacation week on a particularly rainy morning, Howie was doing laps inside the house. He grabbed a kitchen timer and timed himself doing one lap in the house. \n \u201cI did that in 16 seconds!\u201d He exclaimed. \u201cNow let me do some homework. If I did two laps in the house, at the same speed, my time should be\u202632 seconds! Let\u2019s try it!\u201d \n And for the next 10 minutes, he timed himself doing laps and predicting what his times would be. \n picture of Howie running\u2026just not at home \n ********** \n It makes me think a lot about the pen to paper issue going forward for Howie in school. The work is just going to get harder. The gap between what he knows and what he can get out of his head will grow when taught in a traditional school setting. He could start to fall behind academically \u2013 not for lack of ability but for an inability to do it in the manner required. His intelligence is his strength and it pulls him through the difficulties he has sitting, attending and well, putting pen to paper. \n So what will happen to him emotionally when his grades may not reflect his true knowledge? How do we keep him from giving up trying to put pen to paper at all?\u00a0 And  how to we make sure he continues to have teachers who stop and listen to his \u201cbutterflies and buzzing\u201d to help him through? \n \n ********** \n I wish I could remember what happened with that applicant all those years ago. I can\u2019t remember if she ended up matriculating or if she went somewhere else or didn\u2019t go to college at all. I hope that wherever she ended up, she was happy with the decisions she made. \n I\u2019m forever grateful to her for teaching me a phrase that would help me understand Howie better than any other. And as we work through the butterflies and the buzzing in his head, I\u2019ll make sure he knows that others have trouble putting pen to paper too. \n \u201cIf you could read my mind, love \n  What a tale my thoughts could tell \n  Just like an old-time movie \n  \u2018Bout a ghost from a wishin\u2019 well \n  In a castle dark or a fortress strong \n  With chains upon my feet \n  You know that ghost is me \n  And I will never be set free  \n  As long as I\u2019m a ghost that you can\u2019t see  \u201d \u2013 If You Could Read My Mind by Gordon Lightfoot \n \n \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/in-your-eyes/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/deskwork.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/img_20130718_175733.jpg", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2014/04/17/m-the-pathology-of-difference-and-a-frog/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2014/04/26/if-you-could-read-my-mind-2/", "title": "\n\t\t\tIf You Could Read My\u00a0Mind\t\t"},
{"date": "April 10, 2013", "body": "So I almost said no. I\u2019m pretty gun shy when it comes to blogging events, especially ones for my kids. My social anxiety spikes and my nervousness about their behavior and their sensory needs and their everything else usually turns into a \u201cthanks but no thanks\u201d email back to the event planners. But when I got the message about a PBS Kids event in Boston at WGBH, I knew I couldn\u2019t turn it down.\u00a0 It was about their new initiative called \u201c It All Adds Up \u201c, designed to bring math and literacy skills into homes all over the world through their online programming and apps. This is an event made for my kids. Still, I was nervous.\u00a0 So nervous that I almost backed out.\u00a0 The first half of the event had parents in one room hearing about the new programs while the kids were right next door doing activities, crafts, etc.\u00a0 That can be just so unpredictable for Howie and Lewis. So I sent this email: \n Hi! It will just be two of my boys ages 7 and 4. I hope that is okay. \n Just a heads up, my two boys are both on the autism spectrum. \u00a0They love math and science and all things PBS but they get nervous and a little overwhelmed in large groups and with characters in costume. As long as I can be nearby for them, they should be okay. But please let me know if you are uneasy about having them there. \n Thank you! \n Alysia I hate sending that email.\u00a0 Not because I am ashamed of my kids.\u00a0 But I am always worried about the response back. But being PBS, I guess I should have known it would be okay: Thanks for the email Alysia. A Curious George character will be present at the event \u2013 greeting people at the door, and then coming out again at the end. You can definitely just walk past and I can let my colleague at the door know. There will be a time when the parents are in an adjoining room listening to a presentation while the kids are playing games and activities in the other room. Do you think that will be ok? We expect approx 30 kids and 20 adults. \n We\u2019d love for you to be there. I just want to be sure you have all the info about the event so you know what to expect. Let me know your thoughts and if there\u2019s anything we can do to help. That\u2019s all I needed.\u00a0 I could prep them for exactly what was going to happen.\u00a0 And I had an exit strategy if needed. So off we went. We got on the highway around 10am, armed with munchkins and juice boxes. I usually turn on a movie or the radio for the boys but I didn\u2019t want to be alone with my thoughts. So we talked. We laughed at the leprechaun hat that is the symbol for the Mass Pike.\u00a0 We discussed what \u201cMass Pike\u201d actually meant.\u00a0 We counted the Jersey barriers along the side of the road and made believe we were racing the big trucks.\u00a0 We squealed with delight as we went under the \u201ccool hotel that makes a bridge over the highway\u201d. We shouted and pointed at the large building with the Word Girl animation on it.\u00a0 I told them that was where we were going. Their excitement was growing.\u00a0 My anxiety was almost gone. We bounded our way into the WGBH building and were immediately greeted by Curious George.\u00a0 Lewis stood behind me. Howie went right up to him and gave him a big high-five. In the elevator, he turned to me and in an exaggerated whisper he said \u201c that was just a guy in a costume, you know .\u201d I knew we\u2019d be okay. We entered the room to check in.\u00a0 The boys got name tags with their names written in their favorite colors.\u00a0 The room was filled with coloring pages, games, activities and kids.\u00a0 A giant TV on the wall was showing Curious George. A lovely young lady motioned for them to sit with her and play.\u00a0 And they did. My fears about the event now gone, I found a seat in the presentation room. I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting were doing so much for kids in the area of math, science and literacy.\u00a0 But the approach they are taking is truly remarkable.\u00a0 By creating content online that complements their TV programming, they are engaging kids in a whole new way.\u00a0 We learned about a new show called \u201c Peg + Cat \u201d which is all about math skills but taught in a humorous and approachable way. And written on a level that both kids and their parents can find interesting.\u00a0 Example : a reference to turning up an amplifier to the number 11 \u2013 a slight nod to Spinal Tap that had me and my friend  Jessica  giggling. What really got me though were the  online games and apps  targeted exactly at my kids.\u00a0 Apps for Martha Speaks, Wild Kratts, Dinosaur Train and Cyberchase and games for Curious George. My kids\u2019 shows. When we left the presentation, we got to see the games and apps in action. Howie is very new game phobic.\u00a0 He is afraid of trying a new game or app because he is hyper-competitive and worried about losing.\u00a0 \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d was the response I got when I asked if we should try the new  Curious George Bubble Pop  game. But Lewis?\u00a0 Drawn to games like\u2026like a kid who loves iPads and computer games. Playing Curious George Bubble Pop. And yes, that\u2019s a breadstick in his hand. We mutli-task. The premise of the game is that when you see a bubble on the screen, you yell \u201cPop!\u201d.\u00a0 And it pops.\u00a0 George gives a little squeal and counts the numbers of bubbles that have popped. No mouse.\u00a0 No keyboard.\u00a0 And you don\u2019t even need to say \u201cpop\u201d.\u00a0 You can clap your hands or make any noise and the bubble pops on the screen. It only took 10 bubbles popping before Howie joined in too.\u00a0 For a few minutes, they were both yelling \u201cPOP!\u201d at the tops of their lungs.\u00a0 And each time Howie jumped up and down with delight. Yelling POP! Because it\u2019s okay to yell sometimes. Instantly I saw the beauty of this game for kids like mine.\u00a0 No fine motor control needed.\u00a0 No speech.\u00a0 And online for free. This game teaches cause and effect, counting, and math skills without having to say a word or navigate a mouse or keyboard. All accessible anywhere on any computer with a microphone. As my kids were yelling \u201cPOP!\u201d, I made my way over to the woman representing PBS. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for this,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cThis game is really perfect.\u00a0 My two kids are on the autism spectrum and for them to be able to navigate a game flawlessly without specific words or the mouse is just incredible.\u201d There\u2019s a chance that I caught her a little off guard.\u00a0 But as she looked over at my kids smiling and jumping, I could see that she got it.\u00a0 \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means a lot to us.\u201d Next, we made our way over to the Wild Kratts app on the iPad.\u00a0 Howie got to show off his math skills as he fed the animals in the forest.\u00a0 Lewis honed in on the Dinosaur Train app. I had to drag them out of there. I tweeted:\u00a0 Going right to  http://pbskidslab.org\u00a0  when we get home  # pbskidsaddsup And we did. That night, Howie and I were sitting on his bed before bedtime.\u00a0 We were playing the Martha Speaks \u201cWord Spinner\u201d app that we had learned about that morning.\u00a0 I have never seen him so engaged in an educational app before \u2013 laughing, smiling, waiting for his turn\u2026excited for his turn.\u00a0 Yesterday, he played it with his home therapist, squealing the same squeal of delight that I heard at the event. Every time the WGBH logo comes up on the screen Howie says \u201cWGBH!\u00a0 We went there!\u201d I am so thankful I didn\u2019t say no. Update from 3:15pm : I went outside to get the mail. I came in and Howie and Lewis were playing the Martha Speaks \u201cWord Spinner\u201d app. \u00a0Together. \u00a0Taking turns. \u00a0Nicely. \u00a0Smiling.\u00a0 This NEVER happens. This is huge. Disclaimer note: We were given free app codes for Cyberchase 3D, two Martha Speaks apps, two Dinosaur Train apps and the Wild Kratts app.\u00a0 Considering how much my kids love them, I would have spent the money anyway.\u00a0 We were also shown another Curious George online game called Monkey Jump \u2013 another game where no speech, keyboard or mouse is used.\u00a0 You jump and Curious George jumps.\u00a0 All you need is a webcam.\u00a0 Perfect for my kids. \u201cSomebody come and play  \n  Somebody come and play today  \n  Somebody come and smile the smiles  \n  And sing the songs  \n  It won\u2019t take long  \n  Somebody come and play today   Somebody come and play  \n  Somebody come and play my way  \n  Somebody come and rhyme the rhymes  \n  And laugh the laughs  \n  It won\u2019t take time  \n  Somebody come and play today \u201d \u2013 Somebody Come And Play from Sesame Street \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.pbs.org/about/news/archive/2013/pbs-kids-all-adds-up/", "http://pbskids.org/peg/", "http://theseversons.net/", "www.PBSKIDS.org/lab", "http://pbskids.org/curiousgeorge/busyday/bubbles/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_20130406_121612.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_20130406_121626.jpg", "http://t.co/YNLAWAn2N0", "https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pbskidsaddsup&src=hash"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2013/04/10/somebody-come-and-play/", "title": "\n\t\t\tSomebody Come And\u00a0Play\t\t"},

{"date": "June 17, 2013", "body": "(Three of two posts about Father\u2019s Day.\u00a0 Yes, I know.\u00a0 Math is not my strongest subject.\u00a0 Moving on\u2026) Tim was heading out the door for work. I said my usual \u201cGuys, say goodbye to Dad.\u201d \u201cBye Dad!\u201d calls Gerry. As the door shuts, Howie says \u201cOh good.\u00a0 I am glad Father\u2019s Day is over.\u201d \u201cHey, Howie, don\u2019t be mean,\u201d I snapped.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re nice to everyone every day even when it isn\u2019t Father\u2019s Day.\u201d He was silent. I continued to get the kids\u2019 stuff ready for school but the statement kept rolling around in my head. It just wasn\u2019t sitting right with me. Not his statement.\u00a0 Mine. I sent some friends a message: As Tim left this morning, Howie said \u201coh good. Father\u2019s day is over.\u201d At first I thought he was being mean. But maybe the pressure of father\u2019s day is what made him so out of sorts yesterday? I know I was on edge. I thought back on the whole day yesterday. Howie up at 3:30am.\u00a0 Climbing into my bed and trying to climb under me. Telling him when he woke up that it wasn\u2019t nice to kick Dad out of bed on Father\u2019s Day. The strings of silly words and refusal to eat any food, only yogurts. Reminding him to say \u201cHappy Father\u2019s Day\u201d to Tim.\u00a0 Prompted three times before he said it. Asking to go outside in his pajamas at 8:30am to go swing on the swings.\u00a0 Alone.\u00a0 For 25 minutes. Telling him we had to be on our best behavior while at work with me with all the dads coming in for Father\u2019s Day. Playing solo at the sensory gym with his own game.\u00a0 Ignoring the other kids that he usually plays with. Reminding him we were giving Dad space and alone time for Father\u2019s Day so we were going to the store/farmer\u2019s market/park. Holding in a poop at the park because he wanted to stay there and not find a bathroom. Telling him we couldn\u2019t go back to the park after the bathroom because it was Father\u2019s Day and we were going home to spend time with Dad. My friend wrote back: And it IS a lot of pressure\u2026 \u2018it\u2019s father\u2019s day\u2026 be nice to dad, give dad a hug, we have to make x for dad\u2026\u2019 Whether it\u2019s father\u2019s day or a birthday or any other out of the ordinary day, it\u2019s tough. I\u2019m quite sure Howie was not being mean at all. You would think at some point I would get this \u2013 truly get this \u2013 for Howie.\u00a0 Clearly, I had anxieties about Father\u2019s Day.\u00a0 The split between  wanting to make it special  while also wanting to  dive under the covers and hide .\u00a0 In an attempt to make it the best day ever for Tim and forget why it was the hardest day ever for me, I whisked my kids out of here for the day. Out of their routine, out of their house, and ultimately out of sorts. The whole time telling them it was in the name of Father\u2019s Day. The exact opposite of what I was trying to accomplish. And so in one short honest sentence, Howie snapped it all back into focus for me. Not mean.\u00a0 Just the truth. He wasn\u2019t saying he wanted to be rude to Tim now that Father\u2019s Day was over.\u00a0 He was saying that it was too hard yesterday to hold it all together to be over the top perfect. The pressure that was too much for me was too much for him too. We\u2019re back to our version of normal today, Howie and I.

{"date": "May 15, 2013", "body": "Two different kids.\u00a0 Two different scenarios. Same internal parental struggle. ********** Part One In Howie\u2019s first grade class, the kids take a math timed test every Friday.\u00a0 They start in November with what they call \u201clittle plus\u201d questions.\u00a0 It\u2019s 50 addition problems on a sheet, adding numbers from 0-10.\u00a0 The kids have three minutes to complete the 50 questions correctly.\u00a0 The goal is, of course, to learn and practice their math facts. I knew from the beginning that this would be a big challenge for Howie.\u00a0 I even mentioned it at his kindergarten to first grade transition meeting last May.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that he couldn\u2019t learn the facts \u2013 his academic abilities have never been the issue.\u00a0 It\u2019s the processing speed.\u00a0 And the fine motor skills for writing the numbers quickly.\u00a0 And the anxiety.\u00a0 And his highly competitive drive.\u00a0 All of these issues had the potential to come together in a perfect storm of frustration and meltdown for him.\u00a0 I thought this was a recipe for disaster for him, that there was no way he could answer all the questions in that time limit.\u00a0 Nor did I think he could handle seeing the other kids complete the task when he couldn\u2019t. Immediately I suggested we think of accommodations for him for the test.\u00a0 I even bought a book called \u201c Last to Finish: A Story About the Smartest Boyin Math Class \u201c. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see how it goes,\u201d was the response back. Every week he tried that test.\u00a0 Sometimes he\u2019d complete 39 of them with the answers all correct.\u00a0 Other weeks it was 42 with a few wrong.\u00a0 One time he completed the whole sheet but had three wrong. Every week he tried.\u00a0 No meltdowns, no frustrations.\u00a0 His aide and teacher worked with him on calming techniques before the test and during the test and they had him stand up in front of the class to teach the other kids how to stay relaxed during a test.\u00a0 They taught him where he needed to be by one minute and by two minutes to complete the sheet.\u00a0 They practiced outside of class and sent home sheets for us to practice at home.\u00a0 He never mentioned if the other kids had moved on to the next \u201clittle minus\u201d sheets. Every week he tried.\u00a0 And every week he came up just a little short. At the beginning of April I mentioned to his teacher that maybe we need to rethink the accommodations again.\u00a0 \u201cWe know he knows the facts.\u00a0 He just can\u2019t get them out fast enough.\u00a0 It has to be affecting him, doesn\u2019t it?\u00a0 Even if he\u2019s not verbally expressing it?\u201d He just couldn\u2019t do it. Until\u2026 He did it. He came bounding off the bus that Friday afternoon.\u00a0 So full of pride.\u00a0 \u201cI DID IT! MOM!\u00a0 I DID IT!\u00a0 I MOVED ON TO LITTLE MINUS!\u201d He jumped into my arms for the best real hug ever. ********** Part Two Spatial relations have never been a huge strength for Lewis.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t have a very good sense of where his body is in space \u2013 meaning he will often misjudge how close he is to a door handle or a corner on a counter top and walk into it or take a misstep and fall.\u00a0 It\u2019s clear he gets this from me, as I have misjudged the amount of space between my side view mirrors and the opening of the garage.\u00a0 Three times.\u00a0 I can never accurately tell how close I am to the curb when parallel parking. Lewis and I also don\u2019t like the feeling that we\u2019re going to fall.\u00a0 For example, he\u2019s very uneasy walking on a bridge on playground that you can see through.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like climbing stairs that are open. Lewis was especially afraid to sit up on a swing.\u00a0 He would lie down on his belly on a swing with no problem and fly.\u00a0 But sitting upright?\u00a0 Nope.\u00a0 No way. So I talked with his home ABA therapists about it and we made it a goal.\u00a0 He needed to learn how to swing. He protested.\u00a0 A lot. They started small with just sitting on the swing for a few seconds with the therapist behind him.\u00a0 The next time he\u2019d sit a little longer. Each time they\u2019d say \u201cIt\u2019s time to swing\u201d he would say no.\u00a0 But then he would.\u00a0 For little bits at a time. Several weeks of this passed.\u00a0 He just refused to sit there by himself and he melted down at the suggestion of a gentle push without someone holding him on the swing. Until\u2026 He did it. \u201cMOM!\u00a0 MOM!\u00a0 I DID IT! I DID TWELVE PUSHES ON THE SWING!\u201d He wrapped his arms around my legs and looked up at me with the biggest smile. ********** Herein lies the struggle. And this is the part that is hard to admit as a parent. With Howie, I had decided he couldn\u2019t do something.\u00a0 Everything about that testing scenario spelled trouble for him. I looked at the parts of his disability \u2013 the hyper-competitive nature, the inability to sit for that amount of time and attend to a task, the fine motor issues, the processing speed \u2013 and I decided he couldn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 I knew he knew the answers and I wanted him to show the teacher that he knew the work without the interfering behaviors that keep him from showing he knows the work. Did he need to show that he knew the answers in the same way that every other kid in the class did?\u00a0 How many times did he need to not complete the task to show he needed accommodations?\u00a0 And did we need him to \u201cfail\u201d before we changed it, or was it better to start him off differently from the beginning? But he could do it like they did.\u00a0 Yes, it took him until the end of April.\u00a0 But the pride \u2013 the glow of accomplishment that he showed \u2013 would that have been there if he was doing the assignment differently than anyone else? So where do we step in?\u00a0 When do we say he needs to do it differently than the other kids?\u00a0 At what point do we acknowledge that \u201cdifferent, not less\u201d is okay?\u00a0 Do we wait until Howie is self-aware enough to say \u201cI can\u2019t do this I need help\u201d or I do decide that for him? Now with Lewis it was the opposite.\u00a0 I pushed for him to work through something that was uncomfortable for him.\u00a0 He was uneasy, afraid, and unsure of himself on that swing.\u00a0 But I asked the therapists to help him overcome it.\u00a0 I decided he needed to learn how to swing.\u00a0 Was that wrong?\u00a0 Would it be so bad if he never sat up on a swing?\u00a0 I am afraid of rollercoasters and any ride that spins.\u00a0 Would it be acceptable for Tim to hire a therapist to make me go on a rollercoaster because everyone else does? So what do I do? Where do I push?\u00a0 When do I intervene?\u00a0 When do I just let it go? When we cross off a goal on an IEP or home program, we call it progress.\u00a0 But at what cost?\u00a0 Or whose definition of progress? I want my kids to reach the next levels \u2013 to achieve the things I know they can achieve and more. To reach their limits and then feel confident to step over that line. But more than anything I want them to be happy.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want them frustrated, scared, upset or angry with me or school.\u00a0 Or life. I need to figure out where my limit is too. \u201c So put me on a highway  \n  And show me a sign  \n  And take it to the limit one more time   Take it to the limit  \n  Take it to the limit  \n  Take it to the limit one more time \u201d \u2013 Take It To The Limit by The Eagles \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603364560/ref=oh_details_o07_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/img_20130501_100749.jpg", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/img_20130501_104131.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2013/05/15/take-it-to-the-limit/", "title": "\n\t\t\tTake It To The\u00a0Limit\t\t"},
{"date": "May 20, 2013", "body": "Instant panic. That feeling you get when you turn around and your child isn\u2019t there. I could tell you about the time when we were in a hotel near StoryLand in New Hampshire.\u00a0 Howie was three.\u00a0 We were staying in one of those two room suites where you could close off the bedroom from the other part of the room.\u00a0 I had baby Lewis ready for the shower, and I went into the bedroom part of the suite and handed him into the bathroom to Tim.\u00a0 Howie and Gerry were in the other room. Gerry was watching a Red Sox game on the TV. I come out of the bathroom and Howie is gone. \u201cHowie?\u00a0 Howie?\u00a0 Where are you?\u201d No answer. I check in the closet.\u00a0 The drawers.\u00a0 Behind the table. Is he hiding from me because he doesn\u2019t want a shower?\u00a0 Playing a game? Both rooms together are about 700 square feet.\u00a0 He\u2019s nowhere. \u201cGerry!\u00a0 Where is Howie??\u201d His eyes shift to me from the TV.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cHowie!!\u00a0 Howie!!\u201d\u00a0 But I know full well he won\u2019t answer to my screams. After what seems like a lifetime, I notice that the door to the room is slightly ajar.\u00a0 I run out into the hallway. At the end of the hall I see Howie.\u00a0 In nothing but a pull-up.\u00a0 I grab him just as a man comes out of his hotel room. \u201cI looking for you.\u201d he said. He was trying to find where I was when I went into the bathroom.\u00a0 The door to the hallway looked like the door to the bedroom in our hotel room.\u00a0 He opened the wrong one and left. ********** I could tell you the statistics.\u00a0 This from the  National Autism Association : \u201ca study released in  Pediatrics  showed that 49% of children with autism like Mikaela are prone to wandering, a rate four times higher than their unaffected siblings. This indicates that this is not an issue of bad parenting. From 2009 to 2011, 23% of children who died following a wandering incident were in the care of someone other than a parent\u201d I could tell you that I know I am lucky that my kids aren\u2019t bolters. For the most part they stay with me in unfamiliar and familiar places.\u00a0 But they lack impulse control.\u00a0 They don\u2019t answer to their names when called.\u00a0 And all it would take is that One. Split. Second. But there are many children who do run.\u00a0 With no sense of fear or danger.\u00a0 Kids that will follow a butterfly down to a creek or decide it\u2019s time to leave and get in the car and lock themselves in.\u00a0 These are\u00a0  my friends\u2019 stories.\u00a0 And their friends\u2019 stories . I could tell you that  three little ones lost their lives this week  after wandering and drowning.\u00a0 Three. But instead\u2026 To honor Mikaela and Owen and Drew I am doing one thing today.

He\u2019s just not interested\u2026 \n Still, I can\u2019t help but hope for that day when my son takes a book off the shelf and says \u201cwould you read this to me?\u201d \n It\u2019s that hope that keeps me on the hunt for those missing  Frog and Toad  books. \n ********** \n On May 7, 2013 I sent Howie\u2019s teacher an email.

{"date": "March 19, 2012", "body": "We throw the word hero around a lot. Athletes are \u201cheroic\u201d when they lead their team to victory in the Superbowl.\u00a0 Actors give \u201cheroic performances\u201d when playing an edgy role on film. And yes, to many, they are heroes. But for me, my hero is someone who has stood up against those who fought to tear them down.\u00a0 Who do things that people say can\u2019t be done, not for their own glory but for the sole purpose of helping another.\u00a0 A hero, for me, is someone who takes the world on, holds that world on their shoulders, and carries the burden so that the rest of us can move freely. I met such a person on Saturday.\u00a0 Her name is Eustacia Cutler.\u00a0\u00a0 Temple Grandin\u2019s mother. ********** \u201cHeading out to hear Eustacia Culter, Temple Grandin\u2019s mother, speak about her life and about raising Temple. I cried three times just reading the prologue of her book \u201cA Thorn in My Pocket\u201d. I am so screwed today #bringingtissues \u2013  Try Defying Gravity\u2019s Facebook  status Saturday morning I sat in the room with about a hundred other people.\u00a0 I settled in to my seat next to my friend  Jess .\u00a0 I balanced my coffee, muffin and notepaper on my lap. Mrs. Cutler came into the room.\u00a0 She asked if we minded if she read some of her remarks because the words \u201ccut close to the bone.\u201d My eyes welled up then and never stopped. For two hours, this incredible eighty-five year old woman captivated the entire crowd. I hung on her every word. ********** I can\u2019t read my notes.\u00a0 I was scribbling so fast trying to keep up with everything she said that I can\u2019t read my own writing. I have snippets of phrases like \u201cAutism is a buzz word, but no one knows what the buzz is about\u201d, meaning that the world out there knows the word autism, but they don\u2019t understand how to interact with our children. I wrote \u201cShe keeps saying \u201cour children\u2019. And then while giving the history of autism she said \u201cAutism is old. Our unease with it is old.\u201d I have another half sentence of \u201cautism can be soul destroying at first for the parent, you think you are no good as a parent and therefore no good as a person.\u201d And then these: \u201cYou will come to terms with it, not like you thought you should.\u201d \u201cThere are no answers, only choices.   Persistent choices. If it\u2019s not working, change it.\u201d \u201cYou too will be changed.\u201d ********** I am truly having trouble processing all that she said. But she did talk about one thing that, for me, \u201ccuts close to the bone\u201d. Her book is called \u201c A Thorn in My Pocket \u201d for a reason.\u00a0 She told a story about Robert Frost and how he came late to the lecture circuit.\u00a0\u00a0 Here\u2019s the quote from her book: \n Theodore Morrison, who knew Frost well, said that Frost also came late to lecturing and was never entirely at ease with it. \n \u201cI always carry something in my pocket I can touch when I\u2019m talking\u201d, he told Morrison, \u201cso I\u2019ll remember who I am.\u00a0 Lately it\u2019s been a thorn.\u201d \n The thorn, Mrs. Cutler said, represented identity.\u00a0 A way of remembering who she is as a person, not just as Temple Grandin\u2019s mother. She said that \u201cautism helped me learn.\u00a0 But it was not enough.\u201d She was an actress, a singer, a journalist, and now a highly sought after lecturer. She rejected every convention at the time and forged her own path, knowing that the only way to help her children become fulfilled was for her to feel full too. She needed her own identity.\u00a0 So while her daughter\u2019s autism was woven through the things she did, it wasn\u2019t only about her daughter.\u00a0 She did research for a local PBS station on autism, but she was the journalist.\u00a0 She sang for veterans from the Korean War who were permanently injured, trying to pull the smiles back out of them. She was \u2013  is  \u2013 an autism mom\u2026plus. I have spent a lot of time recently thinking about what I want to do now.\u00a0 As in the \u201cyou\u2019re-in-this-next-stage-of-your-life-so-what-will-you-do\u201d sort of way.\u00a0 I had been looking at it as something that had to be  separate  \u2013 something not autism-related. Up until this moment. What Mrs. Cutler showed me is that you don\u2019t need to escape the autism to find a piece of yourself.\u00a0 You can embrace what you\u2019ve learned from your child\u2019s autism and then make it a part of what you do for  you . Like my friend did with her  Lego club .\u00a0 Or like what my friend is doing with her  tennis camp . I can take what I know about autism and sensory processing disorder and create my own passion from it.\u00a0 It started with my son.\u00a0 But now it can be about so much more. ********** When Mrs. Cutler\u2019s talk was over, many of us stood in line to get our books signed by her. As I waited, I rehearsed in my head what I wanted to say. I wanted to tell her she was my hero, but not in an overly fawning sort of way. I wanted to tell her about my boys and how amazing they are and how they take care of each other.\u00a0 And how they make me laugh and cry. I wanted her to know about  The Oxygen Mask Project  \u2013 that we were trying to help parents find that \u201cthorn\u201d in their pocket.\u00a0 A way to remind parents that they need to take care of themselves in order to be there for their children. More than anything, I wanted to keep my composure.\u00a0  Do not cry . When it was my turn, I got down on my knee and started gushing. \u201cMrs. Cutler, it\u2019s such an honor to meet you.\u00a0 I know you hear this a lot but you are my true hero.\u00a0 I have three boys, two on the spectrum.\u00a0 I can\u2019t tell you how amazing it is to be here with you today.\u201d (so much for not fawning.\u00a0 Or sounding like an idiot) She looked at my name tag so she could spell my name right.\u00a0 And I continued talking. \u201cMy friend and I started this website to do just what you were talking about.\u00a0 Helping parents remember that they are more than just their kids\u2019 caretakers.\u00a0 It\u2019s just like you talk about so much in your book.\u201d Mrs. Cutler looked right at me. \u201cIt is so important,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have ourselves, we have nothing.\u201d And with that, the tears started to fall again. ********** There were people there that day who have written about that morning much more eloquently than I can. So when you can, please read  HERE .\u00a0 And  HERE . I have one more post in me about this life changing day.\u00a0 I hope I can get the words out. \u201c And then a hero comes along \n With the strength to carry on \n And you cast your fears aside \n And you know you can survive So when you feel like hope is gone \n Look inside you and be strong \n And you\u2019ll finally see the truth \n That a hero lies in you \u201d \u2013 Hero by Mariah Carey \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Try-Defying-Gravity/151654064855804", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Thorn-My-Pocket-Temple-Grandins/dp/1932565167", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Effingham-LEGO-Social-Club/183313941715670", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Well-Served-Tennis-Academy/261926090539606", "http://oxygenmaskproject.com", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/photo.jpg", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/mrs-cutler-part-one-of-like-a-thousand-because-i-cant-imagine-that-im-ever-going-to-stop-talking-about-this/", "http://susansenator.com/blog/2012/03/i-blame-blame/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/hero/", "title": "\n\t\t\tHero\t\t"},
{"date": "April 15, 2012", "body": "GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL!!! Dear Coach- I never thought I would see this day. You see, up until now, we\u2019ve stayed away from team sports.\u00a0 I could never see how it could work out.\u00a0 My son is hyper-competitive about EVERYTHING.\u00a0 We read a book about Hot Wheels cars, he looks to the end to see which car wins the race and declares \u201cI\u2019m that car.\u201d\u00a0 We don\u2019t play board games because they never end well.\u00a0 The whole win/lose concept is a tough one for him. So a team sport?\u00a0 Yikes. But this year many of his peers were starting to join Little League and I didn\u2019t want him to feel left out.\u00a0 His older brother plays baseball and has since he was five.\u00a0 We\u2019ve spent the past 4 springs and summers at the ball field. So I asked him \u201cHowie, do you want to play T-Ball this year?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d came the response. \u201cI want to play soccer.\u201d Now I\u2019m going to let you in on a secret, Coach.\u00a0 I know nothing about soccer.\u00a0 Nothing.\u00a0 Well, I know that in third grade I played soccer for three weeks and quit because it was too much running.\u00a0 I played softball.\u00a0 Less running.\u00a0 My brother and sister played baseball.\u00a0 So naturally, I wanted Howie to play baseball too. But nope, he picks soccer.\u00a0 Of all the sports, I know the least about the rules of soccer.\u00a0 It used to be hockey, but my friend  Stimey  has taught me a lot.  So\u2026when he said \u201csoccer\u201d, I almost said no.\u00a0 Almost. \u201cReally?\u00a0 Soccer?\u00a0 Are you sure?\u201d \u201cYes.\u00a0 Soccer.\u201d I started to investigate.\u00a0 I knew we couldn\u2019t play spring soccer in our town league.\u00a0 The kids there had been playing for years already, even at age six.\u00a0 The competition level would be too much. I had some friends who had played on your  TOPSoccer league  last year and enjoyed it.\u00a0 And that\u2019s where we landed. I\u2019m going to let you in on another secret, Coach.\u00a0 Initially, the thought of signing him up for a special needs soccer program was hard.\u00a0 Clicking that link off the main soccer page wasn\u2019t easy.\u00a0 But\u2026acceptance starts at home.\u00a0 I know what my son can and cannot do.\u00a0 Any other league but yours would be setting him up for failure.\u00a0  And I would be failing him more if I didn\u2019t do it at all.\u00a0  I told him I had signed him up to play.\u00a0 This was about a month ago. He has asked me EVERY SINGLE DAY when soccer was going to start. Can I tell you again, Coach, I never thought we\u2019d make it here? From the moment he stepped on that field, he was home. You welcomed him in, paired him with a helper, and off he went.\u00a0 Surrounded by friends \u2013 new and old. He ran up and down that field.\u00a0 He clapped for his \u201cteam\u201d and he smiled every minute. He scored two goals.\u00a0 You made sure of that.\u00a0 You gave him high fives and cheered him on. You want to talk inclusion?\u00a0 For the first time, my kid was a part of something. High fives all around Clapping for his team Focus...and... \"Another goooooooooooooooal!\" Next week may be different.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know. But you know what?\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to find out. Is it Sunday again yet? See you on the soccer field.

{"date": "April 30, 2012", "body": "Autism Positivity Flash Blog An e-mail from the amazing writer at  Outrunning The Storm : A few weeks back, I got in one of my Google search term stats \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have Asperger\u2019s\u201d.\u00a0 It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve gotten something similar sadly. But, this time I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about it. I don\u2019t know for sure which post of mine they found but I do know it wasn\u2019t what I want to say to this person. I spent some time talking with some blog friends of mine\u2026and we came up with the idea of all posting a letter to this person with a title that would get Google to pull something positive. Her e-mail made me sit back in my chair and think.\u00a0 Those of us who write online know there are all sorts of ways that direct people to our blogs.\u00a0 One of the top search terms that sends people my way (after several variations of \u201cTry Defying Gravity\u201d) is \u201cSquirrels In My Pants\u201d, thanks to a  post  I wrote using that song.\u00a0 I feel terrible for the people looking for Phineas and Ferb who have somehow stumbled upon me and my stories. But this search term \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have Asperger\u2019s\u201d is different.\u00a0 And it made me stop for a moment. Who wrote this? Was it a child with Asperger\u2019s who was struggling and in pain?\u00a0 Was it a parent responding to a statement made by their child?\u00a0 Was it a teacher?\u00a0 An adult?\u00a0 Someone with Asperger\u2019s looking to counsel someone who was not happy? Who wrote it? The thoughts swirled in my head, and at first I wasn\u2019t sure I could write anything.\u00a0 Without knowing the audience, what could I say? Then I realized it didn\u2019t matter who wrote it.\u00a0 Someone did.\u00a0 And whomever it was needed to know that a) it was okay to search for help and support online, and b) when they searched for that support, they needed to find love and acceptance and understanding. ********** But what to say? I can only speak as a parent of two children with autism spectrum disorder. I can tell our google friends how incredible my kids are.\u00a0 That with every turn they astound me with what they know and what they can do. And I can tell them that I know that there are days when it is hard.\u00a0 Very very hard.\u00a0 I watch my kids struggle with conversations and team sports.\u00a0 The things that  Dr. Stephen Shore calls \u201cThe Hidden Curriculum \u201d \u2013 the unwritten social interactions that can confuse so many. But those struggles morph into incredible insights and perspective and success.\u00a0 I have seen it. However\u2026 It\u2019s better to hear from the people who know it best. Listen to Dr. Stephen Shore talk about his life here: Or click  HERE  to listen to Dr. Temple Grandin talk about her book  Different Not Less , a collection of stories from adults on the spectrum about their lives, their achievements, and their successes. Or perhaps\u2026just watch this: To the person who wrote \u201cI Wish I Didn\u2019t Have Asperger\u2019s\u201d\u2026 I hope you\u2019re finding the love, support and hope you need.\u00a0 You have a whole community here to love and embrace you for who you are.

Howie\u2019s  difficulties with eating go WAY back  \u2013 starting when he was nine months old and wouldn\u2019t eat anything with chunks in it.\u00a0 Stage 3 baby food?\u00a0 Not happening.\u00a0 Gagging and vomiting led to complete refusal of many foods.\u00a0 Add in his intolerance to anything made with corn, and his diet was extremely limited almost from the start. And he has a long institutional memory for all things that made him vomit.\u00a0 He knows exactly when he gagged on a strawberry for the last time, and can tell me in great detail why a cracker made him puke (it was wet). But we have a few go-to foods.\u00a0 Pizza.\u00a0 Crackers.\u00a0 Granola bars. Cocoa Krispies. Don\u2019t judge. A few weeks ago, Tim was sitting at the table, eating some chips and salsa. And then words I never thought I\u2019d hear. \u201cCan I have some salsa?\u201d Tim and I exchanged glances, figuring this would never fly.\u00a0 The chunky tomatoes and peppers.\u00a0 The spices.\u00a0 The dipping of the chip into the salsa. We gave him a bowl of corn-free veggie chips and some salsa. Yup.\u00a0 Miracles can happen. Three bowls of salsa and 40 chips later I\u2019m a believer.

{"date": "May 24, 2012", "body": "So\u2026I may have hit the panic button. The permission slip for the kindergarten trip to the zoo came home weeks ago.\u00a0 I wrote it on the calendar and promptly forgot all about it. It\u2019s been that kind of month. The panic started to rise last Saturday afternoon, when Gerry looked up at the calendar and said to Howie: \u201cHey!\u00a0 You\u2019re going to the zoo?\u201d And Howie answered \u201cI am?\u201d The panic hit full tilt that night when I was out with my friends, two of whom also have kindergarteners.\u00a0 We talked about the fact that the kids were riding on the \u201cbig\u201d bus (not their mini-bus), and the trip was 45 minutes each way.\u00a0 With the whole kindergarten class and chaperones.\u00a0 And it was going to be hot.\u00a0 And unfamiliar.\u00a0 And a zoo. One friend was telling me about the social story they had been reading with her son. We had received nothing. I went home and laid it all out for Tim, who was packing for a business trip. \u201cHe\u2019s had no prep and it\u2019s a ZOO and we\u2019ve only been to our local zoo twice and he\u2019s been overwhelmed both times and it\u2019s a long bus ride with all those kids and the smells and the noises and the lack of routine and you\u2019re going to be away and it\u2019s a ZOO!\u201d I took a breath.\u00a0 Tim reminded me that if I was really worried about how he would do, I could keep him home.\u00a0 Do something special with him. \u201cAsk him,\u201d Tim said.\u00a0 \u201cFind out if he really wants to go to the zoo.\u201d My panic calmed enough to sleep that night.\u00a0 For two hours. The next morning, I asked Howie if he wanted to go to the zoo. \u201cOh YES!\u201d Of course. So late Sunday night, I sent off this e-mail to his team at school.\u00a0 Not just his teachers, but the special education teacher, the OT and the BCBA (board certified behavior analyst). It went something like this: I just wanted to check in about the zoo trip on Thursday. Howie didn\u2019t know about it, so I was wondering what had been said to him or the class about the trip. I just had a couple of questions and thoughts about it, to help make it most successful for him. \n Since this will be his first trip on the big bus, it\u2019s bound to be both exciting and overwhelming for him. He and I have talked about bringing his headphones with him for the ride, and I\u2019m hoping he can sit up near the front and with his aide. He may need a fidget or something to have in his hands for the ride as well to keep him comfortable or occupied. The noises, the smell and the crowds of kids and adults on the bus are going to make it hard for him to sit for the 40 minute ride there, and especially home. \n Could you create a social story for him for both the bus and the zoo? He\u2019s going to need the same bus visuals to remind him that the rules are the same as they are on Mini 1. He\u2019s also going to need the story to include the rules for the zoo. We\u2019ve been to our zoo twice and both times he\u2019s been very overwhelmed by the sensory overload of the zoo. Again, the smells and the noises are a lot for him, and each visit we\u2019ve had to take lots of breaks and avoided certain areas. I\u2019m assuming that his aide will be his dedicated aide for that trip and not leading a chaperoned group so if Howie needs a break she can take him off somewhere quiet without interrupting the whole group. \n If you send the story home with him by Tuesday, that will give us time to review it with him so he\u2019s comfortable with both the zoo and bus. I assume his aides will have time to read it with him too. I\u2019ll also make sure we look at the zoo website so he\u2019s familiar with the animals there. If there are any that scare him or make him nervous, I\u2019ll make sure to tell you. \n I asked Howie if he wanted to go on the trip and he really does, so I know he\u2019ll be motivated to be there. This is his first big field trip so he\u2019s really going to need some extra supports. \n Additionally, as I wrote in his home log on Friday, Tim is away on a business trip for the week this week. As you may remember, that was hard for him last time Tim was gone (back in November). He\u2019ll need some extra love and care this whole week in addition to the help on the field trip. \n Let me know if there\u2019s anything else I can do to help make this field trip successful for him. (note to self: don\u2019t write e-mails to school when you are overtired, overwhelmed, and over-panicked.\u00a0 Your e-mails will be twice as long and twice as desperate as needed) Monday afternoon, Howie brought home a nice social story about the bus ride and the zoo trip.\u00a0 His aide assured me that he would be fine and asked me to send along some extra chewy fruit snacks just in case he needed that sensory input at the zoo.\u00a0 Both the OT and his special ed teacher e-mailed me back to tell me they had it covered and that they were confident that things would go well. I was still on the fence. We read the social story on Tuesday and Wednesday, and he also read it with his home therapist (who, just by chance, had been to that zoo and told him all about it).\u00a0 We investigated the website and saw all the animals.\u00a0 He picked out his favorites. I was still not convinced.\u00a0 I knew that the zoo trip would be a game time decision.\u00a0 As everything always is. This morning was zoo day. His repetitive behaviors were on an uptick.\u00a0 He was hitting himself in the head and babbling. We read the story once again before school. I kept checking in with him about how he was doing.\u00a0 \u201cAre you sure you can go to the zoo today?\u201d He looked right at me.\u00a0 \u201cThe zoo is going to be A-ok\u201d. Well then.\u00a0 Game time decision made.\u00a0 Shoes on and out the door. ********** My stomach was in knots from 7:40 am to 2:00pm.\u00a0 I thought for sure I would get a call to come get him.\u00a0 Once 2pm came around I knew he\u2019d have to be back at school. I was still a mess. His bus rolled up at 3pm.\u00a0 I stepped on the stairs to help him off and one of the classroom aides was on the bus. \u201cHowie did AWESOME at the zoo!\u201d And a huge smile from Howie. I thanked the aide profusely and ran inside with Howie.\u00a0 I checked his home log and read this: the orange marker thank you is mine.\u00a0 it\u2019s all I could find around here\u2026 So the moral of the story is\u2026it pays to panic. Okay, maybe not. I guess the moral of the story is that I have to let some things go.\u00a0 I have to let him try to do the things his peers are doing even if it terrifies me.\u00a0 And we have to make sure he has the supports and the preparation so he  can  do the things that others do.\u00a0 Him  not  going would have made him stand out more. My kid ROCKED the zoo today. And I may finally get some sleep tonight. \u201c We\u2019re goin\u2019 to the zoo, zoo, zoo \n  How about you, you, you? \n  You can come too, too, too \n  We\u2019re goin\u2019 to the zoo, zoo, zoo \u201d \u2013 Going to the Zoo by Raffi \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/zoo.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/05/24/going-to-the-zoo/", "title": "\n\t\t\tGoing To The\u00a0Zoo\t\t"},
{"date": "May 9, 2012", "body": "A friend said to me the other day \u201cYou spend an awful lot of time on Facebook and Twitter.\u00a0 What are you doing on there?\u201d This is my response: It was simple at first.\u00a0 I got an email asking for some advice.\u00a0 I replied. And then I got this back: I am really completely floundering in all this\u2026the bottom line is that I am really just trying to figure this all out on my own. Every time I reach out to our current \u201cteam\u201d from Early Education they simply tell me what a wonderful job I\u2019m already doing. Well, that\u2019s nice to hear, but it\u2019s not enough. I KNOW I\u2019m not doing enough. I need someone to give me some tools, some ideas, something that gives us a direction. \n We haven\u2019t really established a doctor who understands the issues and is working with us. We have pretty much only taken him when he is ill. We now have a medical card for him, but don\u2019t know how to begin choosing a doctor\u2026I don\u2019t want to have to go through trying a bunch to find the right one. But I know I need to bite the bullet and find someone who can work with us. \n I\u2019m rambling now. Sorry. Bottom line is, thanks for replying, and thanks for listening. Sometimes I feel that I should apologize for taking up people\u2019s time because I know what a precious resource that is. She needed help. She was on her own. I know this feeling all too well. I wrote back: Keep rambling. Yes, we all have things going on. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re here  to support each other. \nI know that floundering feeling. Can I help by asking some friends is they know good docs in your area that have worked with kids on the spectrum? I have some good connections. \nI know that insurance reform is happening where you live, so hopefully you\u2019ll have some relief there and access to more home help. It sounds like that\u2019s what you need the most right now. Let\u2019s see how we can get you that . \nKeep talking to me and others. Please. And please remember to try to take care of you too. Just a few moments for you, with some peace and quiet. \nLet me know if it\u2019s okay to ask around. Anonymously of course. So I did. I posted it on my blog Facebook page.\u00a0 I sent out a tweet.\u00a0 I wrote an e-mail or two (or three or four). And then it happened. \n Diary of a Mom \n \n looking for autism folks in lincoln, nebraska and wichita, kansas for a couple of mamas in need of local connections / guidance. anyone? \n And 19 comments followed.\u00a0 All parents in those areas looking to connect and offer help. \n Then I tweeted this: \n \n \u00a0 @ trydefyinggrav  Friend looking 4pediatrician in Wichita KS area that works well w kiddos w  # autism  Family has no help \n \n And got several RTs and people making calls and connections. \n \n Next came this: \n  \u200f  @ xtremeparnthood \u00a0  Calling all  # autism  peeps: Anyone live in the Lincoln, NE or Wichita, KS area?

Under the banner of \u201cWe Get It\u201d. \n ********** \n That is the power of social media. \n Without the connections I\u2019ve made online, I\u2019d still be lost.\u00a0 Floundering. \n I thought there was no one like me.\u00a0 I thought there wasn\u2019t any child like my child. \n Then I started reading blogs and Facebook pages.\u00a0 I started writing our story. \n I joined Twitter. \n I know what I know about parenting a special needs child because of the people I have met online.\u00a0 These friends made me the advocate and parent that I am today. \n They gave me hope when I had none.\u00a0 A virtual hand to hold and shoulder to cry on when I had no one.\u00a0 At any time, day or night. They gave me the strength to reach out IRL (in real life). \n You want to know why I\u2019m on Facebook and Twitter so much?\u00a0 Because I never feel alone. \n ********** \n I asked my now new friend if I could share her story here.\u00a0 She agreed and wrote: \n \n When you write your post, I would suggest that you also really encourage people to REACH OUT in those moments when they feel adrift and alone. No matter how silly it feels, no matter what you worry people may think of you\u2026We are all parents of amazing kids who want to create a world in which they can thrive, and we would do anything to help one another reach that shared goal! \n \n On behalf of my friend, I am asking you to get connected.\u00a0 Whether you are just starting on this journey or have been on this road for a while, reach out.\u00a0 Join Facebook groups.\u00a0 Get on Twitter.\u00a0 Make new friends. \n Visit websites like: \n My Autism Team : \u201cThe social network for parents of children with autism.\u00a0 Find parents like you.\u201d \n Squag : \u201cA curated social space for kids with autism (and other learning differences) to build ideas about themselves.

It feels like a lifetime ago but I remember it so clearly.\u00a0 A gray December day, sitting in the small office of the developmental pediatrician.\u00a0 I was in the back of the room while the doctor was administering the ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) to Howie.\u00a0 Every once in a while she\u2019d quietly tell me what she was doing, but her eyes stayed on my son the whole time.\u00a0 The doctor tried to engage him in the construction activity, but he just took the pieces he wanted and did it his way.\u00a0 He had almost zero interest in the Birthday Party activity.\u00a0 And the tea party?\u00a0 Forget it.\u00a0 He was more interested in the cars in the parking lot. I had no idea what she was looking for or why these activities were so important.\u00a0 The words \u201cjoint attention\u201d and \u201cpretend play\u201d weren\u2019t part of my vocabulary at all.\u00a0 I just thought my kid liked to line up cars and drive them.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know these were red flags. \u201cSee how he\u2019s watching the wheels on the car as it drives back and forth?\u201d I saw it.\u00a0 The report was clear.\u00a0 I got it. Fast forward to August 2011. I\u2019m sitting in a different, yet very familiar looking, office watching the doctor administer the ADOS to Lewis.\u00a0 We\u2019re there because his speech is still delayed and his therapist thought there might be something more going on.\u00a0 I watch him engage with the doctor as they play with an airplane.\u00a0 He mimics the doctor\u2019s play skills, but doesn\u2019t take them further. They take out a birthday cake and try to have a party.\u00a0 He plays along but refuses to blow out the pretend candles. In my head I\u2019m screaming, urging him on.  We do this at home! Lewis, it\u2019s just like the Lego Duplo cake we make ! They hand him a doll and ask him to feed it.\u00a0 He just holds it.\u00a0 They ask him to set a table.\u00a0 He stares blankly. I KNOW what they are looking for. At our follow up appointment for Lewis, the doctor mentions all these things as \u201cred flags\u201d for autism.\u00a0 I argue with her a little.\u00a0 I tell her that he\u2019s the youngest of three boys.\u00a0 We have no dolls in our house and he\u2019s never seen anyone feed a baby.\u00a0 How would he know what to do? And the table setting?\u00a0 Have you seen our house?\u00a0 It\u2019s a miracle if we all sit down to eat together. And let\u2019s not forget that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.\u00a0 I have been hypervigilant about the pretend play with Lewis.\u00a0  Hell, I even wrote about it . But I didn\u2019t push it with the doctor.\u00a0 There was enough other \u201cstuff\u201d that qualified him for the PDD-NOS diagnosis. In my head, though, I never let it go.\u00a0 This felt like more of an indictment on my parenting skills and not his actual play skills. Fast forward to May 2012 I\u2019m sitting in our TV room answering some e-mails.\u00a0 Howie and Lewis are scurrying around in the other room, building something with blocks. The conversation is flowing between them.\u00a0 They are giggling. \u201cLet\u2019s get a red block and put it here!\u201d, yells Lewis \u201cPerfect,\u201d says Howie. \u201cNow, we just need a blanket.\u201d A few minutes pass. \u201cMom!\u00a0 Come see what we made!\u201d I walk into the other room to this: shhh\u2026baby Stormtrooper is sleeping\u2026 They took their \u201cbaby Stormtrooper\u201d and made him a crib.\u00a0 Lewis grabbed the dish towel from the kitchen for a blanket. \u201cShhh\u2026we fed him breakfast and now he\u2019s sleeping.\u201d Take  that , ADOS. Yes, this is the result of much therapy and attention to play skills and conversation.\u00a0 Both of them have these goals not only at school but in their home therapy as well. But it struck me that maybe it wasn\u2019t so much a  lack  of pretend play skills but rather a lack of the \u201cright\u201d pretend play skills. Or perhaps: \u201c These aren\u2019t the pretend play skills you\u2019re looking for .\u201d My kids will always beat to their own drummer.\u00a0 You could hand them a doll today and they may or may not know what to do with it.\u00a0 They still like to look at the wheels of cars and will tell you the name of a car just based on its logo.\u00a0 They will build elaborate structures with their Legos but prefer to drive their Hot Wheels through it rather than pretend that people live in it. But they are playing.\u00a0 Together. I\u2019ll take that over a fake birthday cake any day.

{"date": "June 14, 2012", "body": "An open letter to the woman who subbed in my son\u2019s classroom\u2026 Dear Substitute- You caught me off guard today. I was running late for a meeting when you stopped me on the sidewalk outside of the school. When you asked me how Howie was doing, I thought it was just small talk at first. So I replied with my usual \u201cfine, thank you.\u201d\u00a0 Because it\u2019s true.\u00a0 For the most part. But then you went on.\u00a0 Sharing that you had been in his classroom several times this year, working as an aide. I knew that, of course.\u00a0 Small town and all.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve known each other from the neighborhood for a while so I recognized your name as a sub. \u201cThat Howie,\u201d you said.\u00a0 \u201cHe really is\u2026um\u2026he really is his own person isn\u2019t he?\u201d Suddenly it wasn\u2019t small talk anymore for me. You stopped me cold. In a split second, a thousand thoughts flew threw my brain.\u00a0 I truly wanted to believe you meant this in a nice way.\u00a0 I really did. And I wanted to believe that you know about my son\u2019s challenges, especially in the classroom.\u00a0 That before you went in as an aide you were told about his autism and sensory issues and what to expect.\u00a0 I know the school staff would have shared this with you. But it was the tone of your words that told me this wasn\u2019t a compliment. I stared at you for a moment. I wanted to tell you what a hard year this has been for my little boy.\u00a0 That the transition to kindergarten was not an easy one and he never recovered until just last month.\u00a0 I wanted to share how his autism presents itself in the classroom and that sometimes things are  just so hard  for him that he lashes out at whomever is next to him.\u00a0 I wanted to apologize for anything and everything he might have said or done in your presence.\u00a0 I wanted you to know that he can\u2019t help it.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t mean it. And then I wanted to scream at you with a  what the hell are you talking about? What are you trying to say?\u00a0 That my son is difficult?\u00a0 Frustrating?\u00a0 Hard to work with?\u00a0 This is my amazing little guy!\u00a0 You don\u2019t know.\u00a0 How could you know? Do you see what he goes through every damn day just to sit in that room? You, with your perfect children, sitting in judgement of my child?\u00a0 How dare you? I wanted to tell you how proud I am of him for just surviving this year. But instead I simply said, \u201cYes. He is his own person, isn\u2019t he.\u00a0 I\u2019m pretty proud of that.\u201d I turned around. I walked into the school. You didn\u2019t see the tears well up in my eyes. But you did see that I held my head up high. I will continue to teach my sons \u2013 all three of them \u2013 that it is okay to \u201cbe your own person\u201d. I hope your daughters are their own people too. However.. Forgive me if I don\u2019t ever stop for small talk with you again. \u201c Whether I\u2019m right or whether I\u2019m wrong \n Whether I find a place in this world or never belong \n I gotta be me, I\u2019ve gotta be me \n What else can I be but what I am I want to live, not merely survive \n And I won\u2019t give up this dream \n Of life that keeps me alive \n I gotta be me, I gotta be me \n The dream that I see makes me what I am .\u201d \u2013 I\u2019ve Gotta Be Me by Sammy Davis, Jr. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/06/14/ive-gotta-be-me/", "title": "\n\t\t\tI\u2019ve Gotta Be\u00a0Me\t\t"},
{"date": "May 3, 2012", "body": "Thursday, April 12th Tim and I are sitting in the office of the boys\u2019 general pediatrician.\u00a0 We\u2019ve just handed her the Vanderbilt Parent Assessment for ADHD.\u00a0 After a phone consultation the day before with Howie\u2019s developmental pediatrician, I downloaded the form from the internet and brought in to the doctor. The doctor looks at Tim. \u201cDid you fill this out together? Do you agree with the answers on this sheet?\u201d Yes, Tim answers. \u201cWow.\u00a0 Well, I don\u2019t even have to officially score it.\u00a0 His numbers are so high.\u00a0 We\u2019re clearly looking at adding an ADHD diagnosis here.\u201d I knew that already.\u00a0 In addition to finding the assessment on the internet, I also found the score sheet.\u00a0 Because I\u2019m  that  mom now. \u201cSo,\u201d the doctor said, \u201clet\u2019s talk about what\u2019s next.\u00a0 You already have all the behavioral supports in place.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to talk medication.\u201d Again, we knew that already.\u00a0 We had done our research. The conversation was not  if  medication, but which one. I was grateful to have Lewis sitting on my lap.\u00a0 I could focus on him and fight back the tears. My friend asks me later that day through e-mail if I\u2019m relieved to have this new diagnosis.\u00a0 She\u2019s referring back to when Howie was diagnosed with autism back in December 2009, when I said how relieved I was to finally have an understanding of what was going on with my son.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not like that this time.\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s more like : okay, now what.\u201d Acceptance starts at home. Friday, April 13th I am supposed to meet a friend at dinner time for a political meet and greet.\u00a0 Lewis and I had spent an hour that morning running around, trying to find a place to fill Howie\u2019s prescription.\u00a0 I sat at the kitchen table, fumbling with the medicine bottle. I write my friend the following e-mail: So\u2026I can\u2019t do it.\u00a0 I am a mess.\u00a0 I can\u2019t go tonight. Getting the meds proved to be more of a trigger than I thought. \n I know this is the right thing.\u00a0 I know this is the next path.\u00a0 Rationally I have no second thoughts.\u00a0 But I am terrified, anxious, worried\u2026and sad.\u00a0 Really really sad. \n I can\u2019t get my game face on tonight knowing what tomorrow brings.\u00a0 Or might not bring.\u00a0 I kinda just want to cuddle up with Howie tonight as  he thrashes around in his skin  before everything changes. \n So I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0 I hope you get it.\u00a0 Well, I know you\u2019ll get it.\u00a0 I really really wanted to go.\u00a0 Really really really. \n Love, Alysia Acceptance starts at home. Saturday, April 14th \u2013 Saturday April 28th \n I see the change right away.\u00a0 With one dose.\u00a0 He\u2019s calmer.\u00a0 Clearer.\u00a0 Words and thoughts and feelings are coming out that never did before.\u00a0 His first week on the medication was our spring break week.\u00a0 We are able to problem solve and work things through.\u00a0 His clothing anxieties are gone. I don\u2019t have to sit in the room when he played with his brothers to facilitate play. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was just seeing something because I wanted to see it, but others saw it too. When Howie returned to school, he had his best week in months.\u00a0 School work was fun again.\u00a0 He\u2019s interacting with peers, taking turns, and playing games.\u00a0 He has  two amazing soccer practice s. Acceptance begins at home. Sunday, April 29th Things begin to unravel. Anxieties are back with a vengeance. Meltdowns are powerful. I pull him kicking, screaming and crying off the soccer field. Acceptance is getting harder to swallow. Tuesday, May 1st His aggressions return at school. His  beloved bus driver  quit and he refuses to get on the bus to go home, instead screaming and flopping to the floor in the principal\u2019s office.\u00a0 I\u2019m called to get him. He  tears at his clothes for two hours  before finally falling asleep. He tells me he wishes he wasn\u2019t human. I can\u2019t accept that. Wednesday, May 2nd I keep him home for a personal day. We make the world\u2019s best marble track and have cupcakes for lunch. He has his best home therapy session in weeks and spends the evening at a friend\u2019s house making homemade pasta. I confirm our appointment with his pediatrician for the next day. Acceptance is falling apart. Thursday, May 3rd I tell our pediatrician about school.\u00a0 She examines him and tries to talk to him about how he\u2019s feeling. He stares at the red airplane with the number 6 that hangs from the ceiling. The doctor looks worried.\u00a0 She turns to me and says \u201cThis isn\u2019t Howie.\u201d I nod. We agree to take Howie off the medication. We pack up our stuff and she looks right at me. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out.\u00a0 It will be okay.\u00a0 You\u2019re doing fine.\u201d I\u2019m trying to accept that. Tonight I went downstairs to get a snack. I slid to the floor and cried. I cried because I believe that my son needs some medication in addition to all the behavioral supports he has.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t know how to find the \u201cright\u201d one. I cried because for two weeks I felt like my kid was back.\u00a0 The one that was all full of awesome when preschool ended last year.\u00a0 The one who laughed and ran and played and loved school and everything about it.\u00a0  That is my kid. My kid is not the kid who hits his teachers and screams at his teammates on the soccer field or erupts in a fit of rage when someone takes his toy. I refuse to accept that. We will figure this out. Together. We have to. \u201c But I do believe That not everything is gonna be the way \n  You think it ought to be \n  It seems like every time I try to make it right \n  It all comes down on me Please say honestly you won\u2019t give up on me \n  And I shall believe \n  And I shall believe \u201d \u2013 I Shall Believe by Sheryl Crow \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.spdbloggernetwork.com/2012/04/12/feeling-alright/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/take-me-out-to-the-ball-game/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/tell-me-something-good/", "http://www.spdbloggernetwork.com/2012/04/12/feeling-alright/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/eyes.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/05/03/i-shall-believe/", "title": "\n\t\t\tI Shall Believe\t\t"},
{"date": "June 11, 2012", "body": "\u201c For my son, throwing up is the ultimate horror show of sensory overload.\u00a0 He\u2019ll avoid it at all costs\u2026actually preferring to swallow it than throw it up.\u201d \u2013 A conversation I had with a friend when my son was sick Dear American Academy of Pediatrics- I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to respond to your  position paper  on Sensory Processing Disorder and its inclusion in the new  DSM-V  (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). I meant to write to you that night when the paper came out.\u00a0 I read all the media coverage.\u00a0 The articles with headlines like \u201c Doubt Cast on Usefulness of \u2018Sensory\u2019 Therapies for Autism \u201c, with quotes like \u201cthere isn\u2019t much evidence that such therapies actually work\u201d and \u201csome other issue could underlie their reactions to stimuli, such as a behavioral issue.\u201d I read all this and I was angry.\u00a0  How dare you?  I thought.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been living with sensory processing disorder for over six years now.\u00a0  Do you ?  How do you know? I took the time to read your actual position paper.\u00a0 I cooled off a little.\u00a0 I needed some time to think before I could share how I felt. But I\u2019m not going to respond as a writer with interviews and counterpoints.\u00a0 My friend Brenda did an amazing job of that with her post at  The Thinking Person\u2019s Guide to Autism .\u00a0 I hope you read it. Instead, I\u2019m simply going to respond as a parent. I\u2019ll admit it.\u00a0 I had no idea what sensory processing disorder was until about 4 years ago.\u00a0 All I knew was there was something going on in my son\u2019s body that I couldn\u2019t figure out.\u00a0 Back then, we called it \u201cnot comfortable in his own skin.\u201d\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t sleep without touching me and would wake up every 45 minutes.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t eat anything with chunks.\u00a0 Smells and noises threw him for a loop.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t want to be touched, yet he would smash his body into me and everything around him.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t handle the world around him. We called our pediatrician.\u00a0 She told us to call early intervention.\u00a0 We filled out the  Dunn Sensory Profile . It was the first time I cried as a parent over a form.\u00a0 The questions kicked me in the gut.\u00a0 It was clear that my son had \u201cdefinite differences\u201d in many areas. We qualified for early intervention for occupational therapy for his sensory issues.\u00a0 Once a week, the OT came to visit.\u00a0 She would have him carry heavy balls around and knock down towers.\u00a0 She put him in a body sock and sang songs to him.\u00a0 She created obstacle courses and did joint compressions.\u00a0 She \u201c brushed \u201d him. I\u2019ll admit it again.\u00a0 At first I thought\u2026what the heck is this?\u00a0 How could this help? But it did.\u00a0 My son was calmer after his sessions with his OT.\u00a0 Some therapies worked better than others.\u00a0 We did what worked and stopped when it didn\u2019t. In preschool, he had a very set routine with the school OT for a in-school sensory diet that consisted of before school \u201ctune-ups\u201d, and many sensory breaks as needed throughout the day which included walks, jumps on the trampoline, and swinging in the therapy swing. We also had a routine at home. The school sensory diet piece got dropped at the beginning of his kindergarten year \u2013 or perhaps more precisely, the need for this sensory diet was not as understood at the kindergarten level \u2013 and we had quite a downward spiral in behavior in the classroom and at home. Now, with the guidance of the school OT, my son has a much better prescribed sensory diet in the classroom in conjunction with his behavior plan, and he\u2019s doing much better. Now, I\u2019ll tell you, American Academy of Pediatrics, in reading the actual paper, there are some interesting pieces in there. One piece is is making pediatricians more aware of sensory issues, and encouraging parents to delve deeper into the route causes of the sensory overload. For many parents, like me, I noticed the sensory stuff WAY before any of the signs of autism spectrum disorder. I believe that any conversation about this between parents and doctors is a positive step, and you\u2019re asking pediatricians to have frequent follow up appointments with parents who are doing sensory integration therapies. Stemming from this, I am also happy to see the idea of telling parents that it\u2019s okay if one therapy isn\u2019t working and to stop it and perhaps try something else. But\u2026 I know plenty of parents desperate for help and recognition of these sensory assaults who get dismissed by their doctors, or perhaps given an alternative diagnosis that doesn\u2019t really fit their kid but allows them access to services. I wish you had told doctors to refer parents to a qualified occupational therapist for help with the sensory therapies, so that parents aren\u2019t out there trying things on their own with no guidance. The two professions should be working together for the good of the individual child. I have three boys, different as morning, noon and night.\u00a0 My oldest definitely has sensory issues.\u00a0 Hates certain clothes, incredibly picky eater, smells throw him over the edge, can\u2019t stand noisy places. But no diagnosis.\u00a0 My youngest?\u00a0 Has the PDD-NOS diagnosis, but his sensory issues are almost zero.\u00a0 No different from mine. But my middle guy?\u00a0 The one I\u2019ve been writing about here?\u00a0 The one with both the SPD and PDD-NOS diagnosis? I firmly believe that my son\u2019s sensory \u201cfight or flight\u201d reactions are the driving force behind all that he does. His inability to process his world is his biggest issue. Social skills issues, his hyper-focus, his sleep troubles \u2013 all sensory. I can say is that the therapies devised by our OT have worked for my son in helping him organize his body and thoughts. I\u2019d like you, the American Academy of Pediatrics, to spend just one day in my house.\u00a0 Then perhaps, spend an evening with another child who has SPD.\u00a0 And then, talk with an adult with sensory sensitivities. Just like every autistic person is different, sensory issues present themselves differently in every person as well. I can tell you that it is real.\u00a0 For my son, it is his reality twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. As his parent, it is my reality too. Perhaps, AAP, we should shift our mindset away from phrases like \u201ctreatments that work\u201d and focused more on \u201ctherapies that help\u201d. I can NOT behavior therapy away his SPD. My child and thousands like him need access to the sensory tools that will help him cope. I think that SPD should be a stand alone diagnosis. Put yourself in his shoes for just one day.\u00a0 Please. Let\u2019s keep talking about this.\u00a0 I have a feeling that soon you\u2019ll change your mind. How can you resist this face? Sincerely, Alysia \u201c Your mind is made up you won\u2019t even try \n  You didn\u2019t even cry this time \n  You say that we could never see eye to eye \n  And one of us just must be blind  We have our differences \n  We\u2019re still the same \n  See what we want to see \n  But you take a second look \n  And maybe things wouldn\u2019t seem the same \n  If you could see what you mean to me \u201d \u2013 Put Yourself In My Shoes by Clint Black From the SPD Foundation: \u201cYour voice is needed NOW to say that SPD does exist and that many are suffering.  Research on SPD already exists , more than enough for inclusion as \u201ca new category  that needs additional research\u201d!

{"date": "June 16, 2012", "body": "It\u2019s the first night of the last day of school. Howie\u2019s laying in my bed in the dark, watching a show.\u00a0 I\u2019m working on the computer. \u201cMom? What age will I go back to Miss P\u2019s class?\u201d Miss P is \u2013 was \u2013 his kindergarten teacher. \u201cYou won\u2019t, sweetie.\u201d I replied without turning around. \u201cShe only teaches kindergarten and you won\u2019t be in kindergarten again.\u201d I go back to working. Five minutes later, I hear quiet crying. Sobbing. My kid does not sob.  He cries \u2013 loud, shrieking, angry cries. But not like this. \n I turn around.\u00a0 Howie is crying into his pillow. \u201cWhat is it?\u00a0 What is wrong?\u201d \u201cI forgot to move my chair to first grade.\u00a0 I can\u2019t be in first grade without my chair.\u201d\u00a0 More body shaking sobs. I crawl into bed next to him.\u00a0 He\u2019s hiding his face in the blankets. \u201cYour chair?\u00a0 Oh\u2026your special chair.\u00a0 The one with the therabands and the velcro?\u201d About two months ago, the amazing school OT was revamping Howie\u2019s sensory diet for his classroom.\u00a0 She put therabands around the bottom of his chair so he could kick his legs while doing his work and not hit anyone.\u00a0 She put velcro on the sides of his chair and on his desk so he could rub his hands on it for extra sensory input.\u00a0 That chair made all the difference for him these last weeks of school.\u00a0 He knew that chair helped him. And in his mind, the chair was staying put in kindergarten when he moved to a new classroom. \u201cI promise you we\u2019ll get your chair and make sure it\u2019s in your classroom for first grade.\u00a0 I will even make sure it\u2019s there for your summer camp too.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry.\u00a0 It will be there for you.\u201d But then\u2026he went on. Because it wasn\u2019t just about the chair. \u201cWhy do I have to go to another classroom with a new teacher?\u00a0 I will really miss Miss P. Will Mrs. S be with me in first grade?\u201d Mrs. S was one of his aides this year.\u00a0 She really understood him and was with him today on his last day. \u201cAnd my friends!\u00a0 What about my friends?\u00a0 I will never see them again.\u201d I assured him that he would.\u00a0 That we could have playdates over the summer to make sure he saw them. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.\u201d Can I just pause for a moment?\u00a0  In the midst of all this anxiety\u2026as my son is shaking with tears\u2026I see progress.\u00a0  It\u2019s the double edged sword of the special needs mom.\u00a0  With this pain \u2026 the first glimmer all year of connection to peers.\u00a0 The first time ever expressing and understanding that loss of connection. I pulled him in close and told him that we\u2019d make sure he\u2019d see his friends as much as possible. The crying and the questions continued. \u201cHow come none of my friends are with me in my new class?\u201d I had no good answer for that one, not one that was easily shared.\u00a0 Howie is going into a 1st/2nd grade combined class so there were only so many spots.\u00a0 The other parents would have had to first choose the mixed-level class to start, and then gender and all sorts of other things factor into placement.\u00a0 Plus, he had a hard time with the dynamic of his kindergarten class so having new kids around him made sense.\u00a0 Or so I thought. \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t remember all the new kids\u2019 names?\u201d At this point, I had sent Tim a quick text to come upstairs.\u00a0 I was about to start sobbing myself. \u201cMom.\u00a0 I am scared to go to first grade.\u201d Pausing again to mark the moment.\u00a0 We have hit so many emotions in the past but never this one.\u00a0 Expressed so appropriately and so\u2026painfully.\u00a0  We talked through the fear.\u00a0 I told him that every year I was afraid to go to school but once I walked into the classroom I was fine. Tim suggested that we get a class list and meet some of the other kids over the summer so they weren\u2019t new faces in August. Howie sat up straight.\u00a0 He turned his hand into a talking \u201cpuppet\u201d and said, in the most age appropriate mocking voice: \u201cHi.\u00a0 I\u2019m Howie.\u00a0 I\u2019m afraid of first grade.\u201d And he slumped back into the pillow and starting sobbing again. Progress and pain. Somehow, Tim got him laughing a few minutes later and he finally calmed down.\u00a0 He smashed his body into mine and asked if I could hug him. \u201cI love you, sweetie.\u201d I whispered as I do every night. Every night I get the same \u201cI love you too\u201d scripted response back. Tonight I got \u201cThe same back to you.\u201d I\u2019m not going to lie.\u00a0 I am wracked with guilt and joy tonight.\u00a0 The guilt, well, that\u2019s obvious.\u00a0 All year long all I saw were the struggles.\u00a0 It was all anyone else saw too.\u00a0 He never mentioned the connections he was making with his teachers or friends, even when asked.\u00a0 I figured many of the \u201cfriendships\u201d written about in his communication log were contrived social situations so he could practice his skills.\u00a0 I had asked about playdates but he never mentioned any particular friend.\u00a0 What I never realized was that he was connected to them all \u2013 any one could have been a potential good friend.  For the past few weeks I have been so focused on just ending this school year and starting fresh.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t stand to read the communication log one more time.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t bear one more meeting, one more data sheet of tantrums, one more phone call from the school.\u00a0 All about me.\u00a0 Not once did I stop to think that my little guy would want or need something different. The joy?\u00a0 The complete and total appropriateness of his reaction.\u00a0 The clarity of his expression of his feelings.\u00a0 His need to talk about it.\u00a0 The fact that it was about his chair but it wasn\u2019t about the chair.\u00a0 It was the worry about missing the things \u2013 and people \u2013 that helped him the most.\u00a0  I sent an email tonight to his team at school requesting that his chair be moved into a special room so it would be there for his summer program, and asking if it was possible for him to help move his chair into his new classroom before school started again. The subject line of the email was \u201cJust One More Thing\u2026\u201d It\u2019s always just one more thing .

{"date": "July 8, 2012", "body": "It\u2019s midnight.\u00a0 I am lying in bed, talking to Tim.\u00a0 It\u2019s the only time we can talk alone now that the kids are home and awake way later than they should be. \u201cI\u2019m worried about Howie,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s sometimes really hard to see him around so- called typical kids.\u201d He\u2019s referring to a few incidents, but mostly to an afternoon before school ended.\u00a0 Tim went in to volunteer in Howie\u2019s class to help with a science project.\u00a0 Howie had a major meltdown over an experiment and left the classroom to calm down.\u00a0 Tim didn\u2019t see him again until almost the end of the day. \u201cI know,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cThe older he gets, the more his \u2018quirks\u2019 are going to stand out.\u00a0 I just want him to have friends.\u201d I nod silently in the dark. \u201cYou saw that video of  that bus monitor in New York , right?\u00a0 Those are the kinds of kids that will target him.\u00a0 Those are the kids who could hurt him.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong, of course.\u00a0 And I know that. \u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll do what we can to keep him safe.\u00a0 We\u2019ll make sure he stays on the mini-bus as long as he can.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll have to teach him to tell us everything.\u00a0 And then teach him again. And again.\u00a0 And just hope it will be okay. But I know.\u00a0 It scares me too.\u201d ********** On June 30th, my friend shared the link about the New York bus monitor\u2019s story and posted this on her amazing Facebook page \u201c We Care About Someone With Autism \u201c: I\u2019m VERY sorry that this happened, and I\u2019m happy to hear that the students who did this are being punished. But this whole thing REALLY bothers me. I mean, we hear about bullying every day\u2026.yet this person had $650,000 donated to her in order to take a VACATION?!?!?!? What about the thousands of Autistic children who get bullied in school or on the bus every day? Where\u2019s their $$ to take a trip to Disney World? Understand \u2014 I REALLY am sorry that Karen Klein had to go through this \u2014 NO ONE should have that experience. But the public response (on that score) is TOTALLY misdirected. I completely agree.\u00a0 It is absolutely awful what Ms. Klein endured.\u00a0 The children involved needed to be punished and I believe their suspension was appropriate and necessary.\u00a0 No one \u2013 NO ONE \u2013 should go through the kind of abuse that she did.\u00a0 But what happens when it\u2019s kid versus kid?\u00a0 Is there the same outrage? What about my kid who doesn\u2019t understand that someone is verbally abusing him? Or what happens when my kid is the one who fights back and gets in trouble because he\u2019s the one with the behavior plan? What do I do?\u00a0 As parents\u2026what do we do? ********** I\u2019m in Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, having an early morning meeting with a friend.\u00a0 I take a sip of my coffee and look up at the TV screen.\u00a0 CNN is on.\u00a0 They are playing a video.\u00a0 The sound is off, but the tag line at the bottom says \u201cVideo of 13-year-old autistic girl being bullied\u201d.\u00a0 I look away.\u00a0 I search for it later and find this: All the girls in this video are 13.\u00a0 According to comments on the \u201c Bully\u201d movie Facebook page  and a story from  thAutcast.com , the video was taken by the girls perpetrating the attack.\u00a0 The autistic girl\u2019s mom put the video on YouTube to show the world what happened to her daughter, but then took it down when the girls involved received hate mail and death threats.\u00a0 This copy of the video was left on YouTube. This video just makes me cry. How do I keep this from happening to my child? ********** It\u2019s July 4th.\u00a0 We\u2019re on our way back from Target, getting some supplies for a holiday backyard party.\u00a0 A CD of some of The Beatles Greatest Hits is playing. I hear singing from the middle row of the mini-van. I look in my rear view mirror.\u00a0 Howie is singing: \u201c Nothing you can make that can\u2019t be made. \n No one you can save that can\u2019t be saved. \n Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time. \n It\u2019s easy .\u201d And then he gets louder: \u201c All you need is love. \n All you need is love. \n All you need is love, love. \n Love is all you need .\u201d He catches my eye \u2013 just for a second \u2013 in the mirror.\u00a0 He looks away but smiles.\u00a0 I smile back. \u201c All you need is love (all together, now!) \n All you need is love. (everybody!) \n All you need is love, love. \n Love is all you need (love is all you need) \u201c I will tell him to be proud of who he is. I must teach him to stand up for himself. I will show him that love is more powerful than hate. He already believes that love is all you need.\u00a0  I have to believe it\u2019s enough. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57457557/video-of-karen-klein-elderly-school-bus-monitor-being-verbally-abused-goes-viral-sparks-charity/", "https://www.facebook.com/CareAutism", "https://www.facebook.com/bullymovie", "http://thautcast.com/drupal5/content/watch-video-shows-bullies-attacking-autistic-girl"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/07/08/all-you-need-is-love/", "title": "\n\t\t\tAll You Need Is\u00a0Love\t\t"},
{"date": "November 3, 2011", "body": "I\u2019ve written a lot about my \u201c village \u201d \u2013 the amazing group of friends that I have who walk in my shoes.\u00a0 The ones that nod knowingly when I talk about my struggles, the ones that make me laugh with a crude joke, the ones that pull me out of bed when I can\u2019t find a reason to on my own. I know that I\u2019m lucky to have this group.\u00a0 Many special needs parents walk this journey alone.\u00a0 I am grateful every day for the moment that these women came into my life. I am lucky in another way as well. I have these three friends, you see.\u00a0 Through some sort of luck, they came into my life and have stayed, even when others have left. They are not special needs moms.\u00a0 But they still \u201cget\u201d me. Let me tell you about them.\u00a0 I will call them Friend One, Friend Two and Friend Three. ********** I met Friend One right after we moved here.\u00a0 Her oldest and Gerry were in the same preschool class.\u00a0 She knew a lot of the other mothers in town and was very outgoing.\u00a0 I, of course, knew no one.\u00a0 Somehow our kids gravitated towards each other in the classroom and became  friends .\u00a0 I invited her over for a play date and we hit it off right away.\u00a0 We had similar parenting styles and sense of humor.\u00a0 It helped that she lived just around the corner.\u00a0 We watched each other\u2019s kids, and she quickly became a second mom to Gerry in his second home. Her son and Gerry have been in the same class together every year since the day they met.\u00a0 They complement each other perfectly, as my friend does to me. She was the first person that knew I was pregnant with Lewis, outside of my family.\u00a0 She was the first person I told that Howie had autism.\u00a0 She loves my kids because they are my kids, and she loves them without judgment or pretense.\u00a0 This year, when things were getting hard at home with Gerry, she invited him over a lot.\u00a0 Helped him with his homework when I could not dedicate the time to it.\u00a0 Her house is Gerry\u2019s safe haven, and it\u2019s mine as well. ********** I met Friend Two on a warm day in June.\u00a0 Howie was starting his first day in the toddler room at daycare.\u00a0 I was pregnant with Lewis.\u00a0 We had just started early intervention with Howie for his sensory needs but I was feeling ill-equipped as a parent to handle him.\u00a0 I needed a break, and we enrolled him in a three mornings a week toddler program.\u00a0 She stood right up and welcomed him into the room.\u00a0 Her love for the kids in there was apparent.\u00a0 Howie left me with no problem, not even a look back to say goodbye.\u00a0 She took an interest in him immediately and would share with me the \u201cspecial\u201d things he\u2019d do during the morning.\u00a0 She got him to try watermelon.\u00a0 And fingerpainting.\u00a0 And a whole host of other things that I couldn\u2019t even imagine he could do.\u00a0 She left the program a few months later to become an ABA tech at the preschool.\u00a0 Our paths crossed there again when she was Howie\u2019s aide last year.\u00a0 She \u201cgot\u201d him right away, and made efforts to really understand his quirks and interests.\u00a0 We call her \u201cThe Howie Whisperer\u201d because she can get him to do things that no one else can. When school ended, our friendship did not.\u00a0 This summer, she took us out of our comfort zone and  we went to the beach  for the first time successfully.\u00a0 When I was spiraling down the rabbit hole during the week we had off for Hurricane Irene, she took Howie out to the beach ahead of us.\u00a0 When we arrived, he was sitting in her lap, calm and quiet.\u00a0 When I was in a deep despair over well,  everything , she swooped in and sent me and Tim out on a date.\u00a0 She put Howie and Lewis to bed \u2013 something only Tim and I had been able to accomplish before.\u00a0 She played board games with Gerry until we came home.\u00a0 In one night, she gave the five of us the attention we needed.\u00a0 She loves my kids for who they are and brings out the best in them and me. ********** I\u2019ve known Friend Three the longest.\u00a0 We met our junior year in college in a History class.\u00a0 She liked to doodle on her paper as much as I did.\u00a0 Again, somehow, we hit it off.\u00a0 We were both Geography majors.\u00a0 We both had a love for orange food.\u00a0 We both hated the same teachers and loved the same wine.\u00a0 It was a friendship that was meant to be.\u00a0 Over the years we stayed in touch.\u00a0 Months \u2013 years \u2013 could go by without seeing each other, but somehow we\u2019d still connect.\u00a0 She\u2019s that friend that even if you haven\u2019t seen her for years, you feel like no time has passed. Now, we connect almost every day through Facebook chat as she kicks my ass in Scrabble. She\u2019s a single mother of four incredible kids, and I consider her my parenting role model.\u00a0 She is the bravest, strongest woman I have ever met.\u00a0 She is my sounding board for all my venting, and we share the most personal of details over chat.\u00a0 She came to visit with her oldest son two weeks ago.\u00a0 We took her son and Gerry out for the night \u2013 to dinner and to the New England Patriots Hall of Fame \u2013 and it was the easiest night I had had in months.\u00a0 Years.\u00a0 The conversation between her son and mine flowed.\u00a0 We laughed like I hadn\u2019t laughed in a long time.\u00a0 They stayed overnight, and the next morning she was on the floor with Howie and Lewis, playing with their Hot Wheels cars.\u00a0 Not pretending to play, but actually playing.\u00a0 Howie designed a car for her on his \u201cCreate-A-Car\u201d app, and she hung it on her fridge when she returned home.\u00a0 And sent him a picture of it.\u00a0 She connected with my kids \u2013 all three of them \u2013 instantly, again without judgment. She has a big birthday coming up. A big party.\u00a0 I can\u2019t go due to  circumstances beyond my control .\u00a0 Because that\u2019s the way it is with me \u2013 always circumstances beyond my control.\u00a0 She\u2019s not mad.\u00a0 She gets it.\u00a0 Without explanation, she gets it. ********** These three incredible women have pulled me out of the deepest holes more times than they probably know.\u00a0 These friends may not walk in my shoes, but they walk beside me along the path.\u00a0 Just as I would be lost without my village, I would be lost without them as well. If they ever need me, I\u2019m here.\u00a0 With my glass of wine and my listening ears. \u201c A good friend and a glass of wine \n  Someone to say it\u2019s gonna be alright \n  A good friend and a glass of wine \n  A little pick me up to get me through the night \n  We talk trash n\u2019 we laugh and cry \n  That kind of therapy money can\u2019t buy \n  Every now and then, every now and then  \n  Every girl needs a good friend and a glass of wine \u201d \u2013 Good Friend and a Glass of Wine by Leann Rimes \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2011/10/17/closer-to-fine.html", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/why-cant-we-be-friends/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/07/05/firework/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/good-friend-and-a-glass-of-wine/", "title": "\n\t\t\tGood Friend and a Glass of\u00a0Wine\t\t"},
{"date": "July 18, 2012", "body": "I knew from the moment his head peeked around the bus seat that he had had a rough day. When Howie\u2019s upset, his whole face scrunches up into a giant frown.\u00a0 He would have the worst poker face. My own face must have given me away when I looked at the bus monitor. \u201cYes,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cHe is very grumpy about something from school.\u00a0 But he held it together on the bus.\u00a0 Told me with his words that he didn\u2019t want me to talk to him or sit with him.\u00a0 He just sat there.\u201d I grabbed Howie\u2019s hand and walked him off the stairs. We stomped together down the driveway.\u00a0 I asked if he wanted to talk about it. \u201cNO!\u201d \u201cDo you want to go in?\u201d \u201cNO!\u201d It was 95 degrees outside and 99% humidity.\u00a0 Howie started pacing in the garage. I sat. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019M THINKING!\u201d Finally it comes out. \u201cI had to finish a worksheet at camp before I came home but I had already done it in school before and I didn\u2019t want to do it and they made me.\u201d \u201cDid you tell them that?\u201d \u201cNO! I JUST IGNORED THEM!\u201d He paced some more. Somehow, I convinced him to come inside.\u00a0 More stomping. He sat down in his beloved green chair.\u00a0 His face was still frowning. From the other room, we could hear Lewis working with his home ABA therapist.\u00a0 They were playing a game, talking quietly. Howie looked at me.\u00a0 He wiped away a tear. Leaning over, he whispered in my ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in there and put on a happy face.\u00a0 Even though I\u2019m not.\u201d I was stunned. \u201cOh\u2026okay.\u201d I stuttered back. And he did. I followed him into the room.\u00a0 He looked at Lewis\u2019 therapist, gave her a big smile, and said \u201cHi!\u201d \u201cHi Howie!\u00a0 How was your day?\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d She looked at him.\u00a0 \u201cYou look happy.\u00a0 Are you happy?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cI am.\u201d He turned to me. Gave me a little smile. He turned back to them.\u00a0 \u201cCan I play the game too?\u201d \u201cOf course!\u201d Wiping away a tear myself, I sat down. The three of them played the game.\u00a0 Incident free. Howie sat on my lap when the game was over. I whispered in his ear. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you.\u201d \u201cI did it,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cI fooled them.\u201d Maybe I will take him with me to Vegas after all. \u201c Can\u2019t read my, can\u2019t read my \n  No he can\u2019t read my poker face \n  (She\u2019s got to love nobody) \n  Can\u2019t read my, can\u2019t read my \n  No he can\u2019t read my poker face \n  (She\u2019s got to love nobody) \u201d \u2013 Poker Face by Lady Gaga \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/poker-face/", "title": "\n\t\t\tPoker Face\t\t"},
{"date": "July 26, 2012", "body": "So I am stepping WAY WAY WAY out of my comfort zone. Next week, I\u2019m heading to New York City for the annual  BlogHer  conference. It\u2019s a three day conference celebrating all things blogging.\u00a0 I\u2019m heading down a day early for the  pre-conference HealthMinder  day, which will have specific special needs panels. If you don\u2019t know me, you may not know why this is feeling so out of my league.\u00a0 I\u2019m the one much happier behind a computer screen than in a crowd.\u00a0 At a party, I\u2019m hanging by the food and drink table or leaning up against a wall in the corner.\u00a0 I prefer to stay quiet, unnoticed.\u00a0 I get anxious and nervous at Costco, so giant conferences make me edgy. But I just had to go to this one.\u00a0 And I have four reasons why. Reason #1 : In addition to writing here I\u2019m also the managing editor at two other blogging sites.\u00a0 For over a year now, I\u2019ve been a part of the amazing team at the  SPD Blogger Network , a group blog for parents of children with sensory processing disorder.\u00a0 The site has a special place in my heart.\u00a0 SPD was Howie\u2019s first diagnosis.\u00a0 Two years ago, when I started to write my own personal blog here, I connected with  Hartley Steiner  at her blog.\u00a0 She encouraged my writing and put my blog on her site.\u00a0 When she founded the SPDBN, she asked me to be there to help.\u00a0 And there I\u2019ve stayed.\u00a0 We\u2019ve created a loving, supportive and understanding community there on the blog site and on our Facebook page.\u00a0 It\u2019s the place I come to when I\u2019m feeling particularly low or incredibly proud.\u00a0 Every story is shared with honesty and love.\u00a0 I understand my son better because of the incredible people who write for us every day. The SPDBN relies on posts from parents.\u00a0 Each day we post a new story.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to BlogHer to meet other parents who share a similar journey and I hope I can convince them to come write for us. (side note: I\u2019ll be the one with the cute Otto the Octopus.\u00a0 See photo below.\u00a0 Made especially for me to take to BlogHer by the incredibly talented SPDBN team Karla from  The Itsy Bitsy Spider .\u00a0 Find Otto, find me.) She made those other cute guys for my boys. I may snag one of them to take with me as well\u2026 The other site I help manage is  The Oxygen Mask Project .\u00a0 It was started with my friend Shannon as a way for us to reclaim ourselves, reminding us that we need to take care of ourselves if we\u2019re going to take care of our kids.\u00a0 It started small.\u00a0 We started tweeting with the #yearoftheoxygenmask, sharing what we had done for ourselves that day.\u00a0 For me, it was drinking my coffee when it was hot.\u00a0 And showering.\u00a0 While to many that sounds stupid, for me just doing that was a challenge.\u00a0 I was so busy getting people out the door to school/therapy/baseball/piano/therapy that there was never anytime for me.\u00a0 I hit bottom.\u00a0 And now we have  880+ Facebook friends  and 52 posts from writers from all over the world.\u00a0 And every day we\u2019re talking about how we\u2019re important too. There will be a special panel at HealthMinder day called  Overcoming Burnout: Replenishing Your Reserves.\u00a0  I\u2019m going to BlogHer because this is exactly what we\u2019ve been talking about for six months. Reason #2 : Two of my favorite people are being honored at the special  Voice of the Year .\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to hear my friend  Varda  as a reader for the \u201cHeart\u201d nominated posts.\u00a0 I expect there to be very few dry eyes in the house. And I\u2019m so thrilled that my friend  Stimey  was nominated as a Voice of the Year for her incredible post  Not Even Wrong .\u00a0 This post changed my life.\u00a0 That\u2019s not hyperbole.\u00a0 I read it at a time when we were having tremendous struggles with Howie and school.\u00a0 Her post about her son Jack changed EVERYTHING about how I viewed Howie\u2019s school life, and made me step back and look at how we needed to teach him.\u00a0 Because my perspective changed, I was better able to communicate with his team at school and we all turned things around.\u00a0 I am forever grateful to Stimey for what she wrote.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to BlogHer to tell her in person.\u00a0 Again. Reason #3 goes with Reason #2 : I\u2019m going to be with friends.\u00a0 Including friends I\u2019ve never met. And, yes, I know that probably only makes sense to the blogging/social media world. The best example of this is how I met my BlogHer roommate,  Kristin . Last summer, my kids\u2019 school opening was delayed a week due to Hurricane Irene. I was completely stuck for ideas on how to entertain them when they were supposed to be in their classrooms.\u00a0 I whined about this on my blog\u2019s Facebook page, and this angel named Kristin asked if I wanted to join her and her boys at their swim club.\u00a0 We had never met, but had a mutual Facebook friend and had become friends that way.\u00a0 I sent her a message saying simply YES!\u00a0 We chatted via email and text, and there we were at her swim club for the whole day.\u00a0 Our boys played and swam \u2013 sometimes together, sometimes doing their own thing.\u00a0 And because we were both autism moms\u2026well the rest is history. We\u2019ve only seen each other once since that day at the pool.\u00a0 But when I decided to go to BlogHer, I asked Kristin if she\u2019d go too.\u00a0 In addition to her amazing blog, she\u2019s also written for the SPDBN and The Oxygen Mask Project.\u00a0 So now we\u2019re taking the bus together down to the big city, and I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll help me get out of the corner. But this is what blogging has done for me.\u00a0 In addition to the incredible \u201cin real life\u201d friends I had, I\u2019ve connected with a whole group of insanely smart, funny, snarky special needs parents who have taught me so much just through their words.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been lucky enough to meet some of them before and now count them as my closest friends. I can\u2019t wait to meet  this friend , and  this friend , and  this friend , and  this friend , and  this friend .\u00a0 I\u2019ve been reading their work for so long and now I get to put a face with the words. And I\u2019m hoping a few other friends will come join me for a drink or two.\u00a0 Or three.. I\u2019m going to BlogHer to connect with the people who have taught me so much. Reason #4 : I need to get away. I\u2019m not going to lie.\u00a0 This has been a long long summer.\u00a0 I need a little break. In addition to the usual summer things, I\u2019ve started a new project and it\u2019s been a lot of work to get off the ground.\u00a0 I\u2019m stressed.\u00a0 And I\u2019m taking it out on the kids. I need a break to sleep.\u00a0 And shower.\u00a0 And pee alone. I have to get some time to regroup.\u00a0 To feel better.\u00a0 To breathe.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to BlogHer to find myself again. I\u2019m terrified of the three days away from my family.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never been gone this long.\u00a0 But I know Tim and the boys will be fine.\u00a0 We have an incredible support system around us here who will help if (when?) things get sticky.\u00a0 I will have a social story ready for the boys so they are prepared too. And when I come back I will be ready to take it all on again. I\u2019m stepping out of my comfort zone and going to BlogHer\u201912.\u00a0 See you there. \u201c Start spreading the news,  \n  I\u2019m leaving today. \n  I want to be a part of it \u2013  \n  New York, New York .\u201d \u2013 New York, New York by Frank Sinatra \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogher.com/blogher-12?from=menu", "http://www.blogher.com/node/689426/schedule?from=subnav", "http://www.spdbloggernetwork.com", "http://www.hartleysboys.com/", "http://www.etsy.com/shop/theitsybitsyspider", "http://www.etsy.com/shop/theitsybitsyspider", "http://www.oxygenmaskproject.com", "https://www.facebook.com/oxygenmaskproject", "http://www.blogher.com/special-needs-caregiving-overcoming-burnout-replenishing-your-reserves", "http://www.blogher.com/announcing-voices-year-12-honorees-and-readers?page=0,1", "http://www.squashedmom.com/", "http://www.stimeyland.com/", "http://www.stimeyland.com/2011/11/not-even-wrong.html", "http://www.runningtobestill.blogspot.com", "http://www.autismwonderland.com", "http://www.sailingautisticseas.com", "http://fourplusanangel.com", "http://dontmindthemess.com", "http://www.childmind.org/en/press/brainstorm/stress-and-special-needs-parent"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/new-york-new-york/", "title": "\n\t\t\tNew York, New\u00a0York\t\t"},

If I don\u2019t return your phone call or respond to one of the 500 e-mails in my inbox, it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want to talk with you.

If I haven\u2019t read or commented on your most recent blog post, it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t care. I just don\u2019t have it in me right now.\u00a0 I can\u2019t do the small talk.\u00a0 I can\u2019t respond to the e-mails outside of the most urgent.\u00a0 I can\u2019t get anywhere on time, mail anything on time, or read the articles I want to read. There\u2019s too much noise going on inside my head. I\u2019m thinking about my friends who have been  without power  for more than 9 days, and about how their kids\u2019 lives have been in chaos since the crisis began. I\u2019m thinking about my amazing  friend  who just ran her first marathon in New York today.\u00a0 Running with my kids\u2019 names on her back.\u00a0 How proud I am of her and how honored I was to have my kids with her. I\u2019m thinking about members of my family who are too young to be in a battle for their lives. I\u2019m thinking about the instant changes we\u2019ve seen in Howie\u2019s plan for school since my  presentation .\u00a0 I\u2019m so happy that things are better but know that it shouldn\u2019t be this hard. I\u2019m thinking about the moms and dads that wake up every morning, wondering if this will be the day when their child will talk. I\u2019m thinking about my friend who husband is home on leave from Afghanistan, and how happy and rested she looks.\u00a0 I\u2019m thinking about how to support her when he returns to his base. I\u2019m wondering how I\u2019ll get through the next day, let alone the next week or two. I\u2019m missing my  dad . I\u2019m struggling with the fact that I\u2019m seeing the \u201cautism\u201d more and more in my two youngest, and I don\u2019t know what that means for them.\u00a0 I\u2019m also wondering if we\u2019ll be adding another diagnosis to the mix for my oldest sometime soon. I\u2019m looking ahead to January, when all three kids have appointments with developmental specialists. I\u2019m terrified of not being here for my kids, so much so that it paralyzes me.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like to travel far from them without them in case something happens. When I am in chaos \u2013 when my brain is overloaded \u2013 I retreat.\u00a0 I wall myself in and protect myself from what I can\u2019t be right now.\u00a0 For better or worse, I need to keep my kids close to keep me from breaking down. You have to understand that there are times that I want to be like you.\u00a0 I want to be able to chat about the weather and make playdates on the fly and comment on every awesome blog post that I see. There are times when I want to be you. but\u2026 I\u2019m thinking that the best sound is my three boys laughing together. Their sweet voices complement each other in perfect harmony.\u00a0 And I hold on to that for dear life, praying it will never change. And that\u2019s when I just want to be me.

{"date": "January 31, 2012", "body": "(note: I was tagged and asked to contribute to an IEP meme on  Solodialgue  \u2013 a way of sharing our experiences and knowledge of the process.\u00a0 She\u2019s an amazing writer and our kids are a lot alike, so I couldn\u2019t say no. Here\u2019s my contribution.) I was out for drinks the other night with some friends.\u00a0 And as much as we tried to talk about ourselves, the conversation floated back around to our kids. I had just had our annual IEP meeting for Howie.\u00a0 We were also going through his 3 year evaluation as well. I told my friends about the meeting and about how I thought it went really well.\u00a0 The discussion around the table was about how to make things work for Howie in school in a truly individualized way.\u00a0 The actual definition of an Individualized Education Plan.\u00a0 I went through the ins and outs of our new plan, why we made the changes we did, and how I feel like we\u2019re all in a good position now to help Howie move forward. \u201c You  made that happen.\u201d my friend said.\u00a0 I was a little startled, not quite knowing what she meant. \u201cIt\u2019s because you came to the table in a respectful and smart way.\u00a0 You advocated for Howie and you knew what you were talking about.\u00a0 They all understood that around the table.\u201d It was quite a compliment.\u00a0 One that I will readily accept. I need to be a major player on the IEP team to make sure my kid gets everything  he  needs to help him succeed in school. ********** I could share the details of my son\u2019s IEP here, but since every child is different and has different needs, I thought I\u2019d go a different direction. The IEP meeting itself can cause stress and anxiety for weeks leading up to the day, and the meeting itself can be quite daunting.\u00a0 It\u2019s usually the parent(s) and then any number of therapists, educators, and administrators sitting around a big table.\u00a0 You\u2019re discussing the most intimate and detailed issues about your child.\u00a0 It can get emotional and painful quickly \u2013 on both sides. I have worked hard to get to a place of mutual respect with all players on my son\u2019s\u2019 team.\u00a0 So I thought I\u2019d share how I\u2019ve been able to make our IEP meetings successful so far. I\u2019m not talking bringing cookies and coffee to the meeting. I\u2019m talking work.\u00a0 For me. I have to do my homework :  The IEP meeting can get overwhelming quickly as terms and jargon get thrown around the table.\u00a0 Before our first meeting for my son three years ago, I asked a friend to send me a copy of her son\u2019s IEP.\u00a0 Not so I could copy it, but so I could learn the language used.\u00a0 I understood that a flowchart would be used to determine my son\u2019s eligibility for special education programs based on his autism diagnosis.\u00a0 I became familiar with the different parts of the \u201cgrid\u201d and delivery service methods.\u00a0 I went to sites like  Wrightslaw  to understand the process.\u00a0 And each IEP meeting, I make sure I know what each goal means and how he\u2019s been progressing on them.\u00a0 So that way, when our OT says \u201cI\u2019m going to move myself from the \u2018C\u2019 part of the grid to the \u2018A\u2019 part of the grid\u201d I know that means that Howie no longer needs direct OT service work, but that she\u2019s adding herself as a weekly consult to make sure his sensory needs are being met in the classroom every day.\u00a0 Or when the BCBA says \u201cWe\u2019re going to start taking more ABC data on Howie to better track his behavior issues\u201d I know that means Antecedent/Behavior/Consequence data. That way, we\u2019re not taking time to go over the details of the words in the meeting so we can have more time to have a philosophical discussion of what that means for my son. I also make sure I have read every report they have sent to us and have copies of the reports with me at the meeting.\u00a0 I need to be as prepared as the other people at the table. This also means filling out any and all paperwork that they send me.\u00a0 For Howie\u2019s evaluation, I had to complete a number of speech/language home assessments and a new sensory profile.\u00a0 I did it the day I got them.\u00a0 If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019m pretty sure I would have lost them in the sea of clutter in my house.\u00a0 The therapists appreciated how quickly I got them back, because it makes their job easier too.\u00a0 In our meeting, our special education director complimented me on returning the IEP meeting acceptance form and thanked me for answering the questions.\u00a0 He said \u201cMost parents just check off that they will be here.\u00a0 They don\u2019t take the time to answer the long term/short term goals questions, or write down what their child\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are.\u00a0 You help us by answering those questions.\u201d\u00a0 I can\u2019t imagine NOT answering them. I Know The Players : The names and titles of the people sitting around the table can be daunting : physical therapist, occupational therapist, school psychologist, special education director, etc.\u00a0 But they are also regular people who play an important role in my son\u2019s daily school life.\u00a0 I need to know who they are and what they do before that meeting.\u00a0 Howie\u2019s OT has been working with him for three years now, and over those years I\u2019ve gotten to know her well and she knows me.\u00a0 So when she tells me in the above example that we\u2019re dropping OT direct service, she looks right at me and says \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about this for a year.\u00a0 He has met all his goals in amazing fashion\u201d I know she\u2019s telling me the truth and I trust her judgment.\u00a0 Our speech/language pathologist is the same way.\u00a0 She lives in my neighborhood and I wave when she goes by on her daily walks in the summer.\u00a0 We stop and chat when we see each other.\u00a0 Our special education director has a son who was in Howie\u2019s preschool.\u00a0 I send thank you emails. I drop in to school and say hello.\u00a0 We have monthly meetings with his classroom teacher and BCBA to check in on how things are going.\u00a0 I know them, and they know me.\u00a0 They know my other two boys.\u00a0 We aren\u2019t strangers.\u00a0 So when I walk in that room, there are no surprises and no unfamiliar faces. Because we know each other, they know I will be as honest with them as they are with me.\u00a0 I will give them the information they need to help my kids.\u00a0 I made sure they had a copy of Howie\u2019s recommendations letter from his developmental pediatrician before the meeting so they could read her suggestions and ideas.\u00a0 I have been upfront about the fact that we have home behavior services now for Howie, and have even had his consulting therapist go into school to observe him there.\u00a0 I\u2019m not holding back, and I expect the same from them. Because of this trust, they know I\u2019m actually looking for information to help with Howie at home when I ask for weekly reports on his OT and social speech sessions and daily logs from his aides.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust that it\u2019s happening, it\u2019s that I want to be able to continue his work at home in a way that he understands. I Know My Kid: \u00a0 I am fully aware of my son\u2019s strengths and challenges.\u00a0 I\u2019m not under any false impressions about his behavior, nor am I ignoring the progress that he has made.\u00a0 So again, I know it\u2019s okay to drop direct OT service from his IEP this year.\u00a0 I know he has met his goals because I see him write, color, cut, fasten and zip every day.\u00a0 I also know that his sensory challenges are not managed appropriately by him in school or home.\u00a0 So I would never agree to dropping access to the OT room or a weekly consult to train staff to implement his sensory diet.\u00a0 I\u2019m also in full agreement that he needs weekly social skills session taught directly by the speech/language pathologist.\u00a0 And I would never \u2013 at this point \u2013 agree to giving up his one-to-one aide, nor would I give up his extended year summer program.\u00a0 And they know that.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about picking my battles here, it\u2019s about knowing what my son needs.\u00a0 So I\u2019m not going to argue for services that aren\u2019t appropriate.\u00a0 But I will push for any and every service he needs for success at school. I\u2019ve learned to use direct and unemotional language in the meetings, but never letting them forget that we\u2019re talking about an amazing 5 year old boy.\u00a0 Our goals as a team are the same \u2013 to help my son succeed.\u00a0 We\u2019re all on the same page. It\u2019s still personal.\u00a0 It\u2019s still about my son. My son\u2019s team knows this and it leads us to creating a respectful discussion around the table.\u00a0 We may disagree but we when we do it\u2019s about the issues and not about personalities. I have had to do a lot of prep work to get us to this place.\u00a0 But it has yet to feel like they are out to \u201cget us\u201d. ********** I\u2019m not naive enough to think that this is some magic formula for the perfect IEP meeting.\u00a0 I know that my experience, unfortunately, is not the norm.\u00a0 I have friends who have done everything right and still end up fighting to get their kids even the most basic of services.\u00a0 Money, personalities, and a million other factors can make IEP meetings miserable for all sides. For me, the key has been realizing that I am equally as important as all the other people at that table \u2013 maybe even more so.\u00a0 That is  my child  we are talking about.\u00a0 His successes, his failures.\u00a0 When he succeeds, we\u2019ve done our job.\u00a0 When he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not because of something he did.\u00a0 It\u2019s because of something we as a team didn\u2019t do to help him.\u00a0 I will make sure that his support team loves him and respects him as much as I do. Our team is now heavily invested in helping my son reach his potential.\u00a0 They want to see him smile every day. That is our number one IEP goal. \u201c Life is very short, and there\u2019s no time \n  For fussing and fighting, my friend. \n  I have always thought that it\u2019s a crime, \n  So I will ask you once again.  Try to see it my way, \n  Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong. \n  While you see it your way \n  There\u2019s a chance that we might fall apart before too long.  We can work it out, \n  We can work it out.\u201d \u2013  We Can Work It Out by The Beatles \n \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://solodialogue.wordpress.com/2012/01/23/the-iep-meme/", "http://www.wrightslaw.com/info/iep.index.htm"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/we-can-work-it-out/", "title": "\n\t\t\tWe Can Work It\u00a0Out\t\t"},
{"date": "October 27, 2011", "body": "Every special needs parent knows that there are times when you have to step in and advocate for your child. Sometimes, it\u2019s at a parent/teacher conference.\u00a0 Sometimes it\u2019s an IEP meeting.\u00a0 Sometimes it\u2019s on the sidelines at a sporting event. Before our kids have a voice or can advocate for themselves, we have to be the ones to speak up and help others learn how to help our children. I did just that today. ********** I had asked for this meeting with Howie\u2019s teacher and his two aides.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t a demand but more of a \u201cI need to come in.\u201d\u00a0 It was becoming clear that they were having trouble understanding Howie\u2019s sensory processing disorder and how it manifests itself at school.\u00a0 He was having more outbursts, more meltdowns and new physical aggressions \u2013 things we hadn\u2019t seen in over two years.\u00a0 I needed to go in and help them understand my child. I was nervous.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never done anything like this before.\u00a0 They \u201cknew\u201d autism, but I had to explain SPD in a way that they would  get him . I read MOM-NOS\u2019 post \u201c A Hair-dryer Kid in a Toaster-brained World \u201d three times while working on my presentation.\u00a0 It\u2019s my go-to post always when trying to explain Howie\u2019s brain.\u00a0 I knew if I could explain Howie\u2019s SPD half as well as MOM-NOS explained autism, I would be in good shape. I searched my brain for an analogy like hers.\u00a0 And it finally came to me. ********** I met with the special education teacher and the two aides on a cold rainy morning.\u00a0 The four of sat in a small office, and I handed them my powerpoint presentation. \u201cMy goal here,\u201d I said, \u201cis to help you understand Howie and how his body works, so that you can help  him  understand how his body works.\u00a0 Especially in the classroom.\u201d My presentation was titled: \u201cAll About Me and My SPD\u201d. I gave them a quick definition of what SPD is: a neurological disorder that causes a virtual traffic jam in the brain.\u00a0 I explained how it\u2019s like autism in that way, but SPD is more about how the brain interprets the information from our senses.\u00a0 When it gets mixed up, it can cause a child to behave inappropriately. I talked about sensory seekers and avoiders.\u00a0 I asked them to think about their responses in certain places.\u00a0 Do you like crowds?\u00a0 Heavy blankets for sleeping at night? Do you get nervous around lots of noises?\u00a0 Are you easily overwhelmed?\u00a0 I shared my fear of stores like Costco and Wal-Mart \u2013 how just being in those places made me so uncomfortable that I choose not to shop there. I told them that Howie was both a seeker and an avoider.\u00a0 That we describe him as \u201cbeing uncomfortable in his own skin\u201d. And his aide gasped a little. I made sure they knew that Howie has had these issues since birth.\u00a0 How I knew from Day 2 in the hospital that he was different because of his non-stop crying.\u00a0 That he wouldn\u2019t sleep without touching someone.\u00a0 Stage 3 baby foods made him gag.\u00a0 He cried at loud noises and had no sense of space.\u00a0 He asked for hugs all the time \u2013 not out of love but out of desperation.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t sit still without moving and would run laps inside our house for hours.\u00a0 I told them he didn\u2019t sleep through the night until he was four. And again, they gasped a little. We talked about his duel diagnosis of sensory processing disorder and autism spectrum disorder and how they work hand in hand.\u00a0 If you understand why Howie feels like he does, then you can understand why he behaves like he does.\u00a0 And I reminded them that we\u2019ve worked with several occupational therapists to get to fine tune his therapy.\u00a0 This was not stuff that we made up. We discussed the eight senses \u2013 sight, smell, taste, touch, hearing, vestibular, proprioceptive and the introceptive sense.\u00a0 I explained what each one was and Howie\u2019s reaction to it all.\u00a0 We talked about that he never gets dizzy, how eating is hard for him, and how he drinks juice constantly to feel \u201cfull\u201d. And then, it was time to help them help him. ********** I called the slide \u201cWhat Does Howie Need for Success in School?\u201d \n \u2022 Think about how you interact with your car \n \u2013Before going on a trip, you fill up the tank with gas, check the oil, make sure everything you need is in the car \u2013Along the way, you fill up the tank as needed. You are proactive in making sure it doesn\u2019t run out of gas .\u2013You monitor the warning lights but rely on the car\u2019s computer to alert you when things are awry. \u2013You enjoy the ride but are always alert for a detour or a change in course \u2013You respect the path and know that it\u2019s a journey, not a quick trip to your destination. \u201cWe know Howie\u2019s favorite thing is Hot Wheels Cars, right?\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cSo let\u2019s think of him like a car.\u201d \n \n \u2022 He needs to fill that tank. \n \u2013The mandatory tune-up in the classroom helps him fill his sensory tank for morning work \n \u2013For the rest of the day, sensory breaks should be \u201cas needed\u201d and not at set times-If he doesn\u2019t need the break at that moment, he will protest.\u00a0 It will \u201coverfill\u201d his tank and not help him. \n -We need to teach him to self-regulate and advocate for when he doesn\u2019t feel \u201cright\u201d.\u00a0 He needs to be able to say \u201cI need a break\u201d and get one, even if it\u2019s not at the designated time.\u00a0 If he\u2019s told to wait, he cannot focus on anything but how uncomfortable his body feels.\u00a0 He will fidget, loudly protest, or not be able to sit.\u00a0 You will see an increase in non-compliance. \n -As he gets older, he will get better at figuring out appropriate self-regulation in the classroom. But right now, he needs help.\u00a0 It may be simple as a something in his hands, or a little squeeze, or some heavy lifting in the corner.\u00a0 It may mean a walk outside, through the halls, or 100 jumps on the trampoline \n .-You will learn his \u201cwarning lights\u201d \u2013 his body moves quickly, or his voice gets agitated, or he starts in on uncontrolled nonsense talk.\u00a0 These are his \u201cstims\u201d.\u00a0 If spotted quickly, they can be diffused and redirected.\u00a0 If ignored, they will escalate quickly to more challenging behavior.\u00a0 His \u201cengine\u201d will rev up quickly.\u00a0 He\u2019s familiar with the \u201cHow Does Your Engine Run\u201d program.\u00a0 Using visuals help him understand where his body is at the moment, and helps divert his attention. \n -If we listen to his internal \u201ccomputer\u201d, he will learn how to take care of himself more quickly and spend more time in the classroom with his peers.\u00a0 His greatest asset is his language.\u00a0 He is his best advocate.\u00a0 If he feels like he\u2019s heard, he can also listen and be reasoned with.\u00a0 If he is feeling challenged, he will not back down.\u00a0 There\u2019s detective work to determine if he\u2019s trying to get out of doing something or if he\u2019s out of sorts.\u00a0 He\u2019s not hard to read.\u00a0 Just listen to his words and body. \n \n \u2022 He needs to fill the tank without being removed from the classroom as much as possible \n \u2013Whenever he can, he needs those sensory breaks to be on the spot and not removed from his peers.\u00a0 He knows that he\u2019s missing things, even if they seem to come at \u201cundetectable\u201d intervals.\u00a0 A sensory area in the classroom or at his table or cubby will help him self-regulate because he can reach for these things easily.\u00a0 These sensory areas can help every kid in the room. \n \u2013Positive and immediate reinforcement are the keys to his successes.\u00a0 The better he feels about himself, the better he\u2019ll sit, the better about himself he\u2019ll feel, etc. \n \u2022Enjoy the ride.\u00a0 Watch for detours \n \u2013Howie is an incredibly bright, funny, and sweet kid.\u00a0 His laugh is infectious.\u00a0 He will take you on the most magical ride this year.\u00a0 If you listen and get to know him, he will wow you, impress you, and make you incredibly proud.\u00a0 In that little body is a big kid waiting to get out. \n \u2013Our job as parents and his teachers is to help him show the world the amazing big kid in there.\u00a0 Our goal always has to be helping Howie with his interfering behaviors so that he can be among his peers.\u00a0 But our goal also has to be respecting his \u201cquirks\u201d and his differences, and helping him feel proud of the things that make him who he is. \n \u2013As his parents, we will always alert you as to the detours that may throw him off course for the day.\u00a0 A rough night sleep, illness, a fall\u2026these are all things that can throw Howie for a loop during the school day.\u00a0 They may seem small to us, but they can affect his whole day.\u00a0 He cannot get \u201cpast things\u201d like we can.\u00a0 A little argument in the morning, or losing his \u201cearn\u201d immediately\u2026those will affect his day.\u00a0 We are always making slight corrections or changes to our approach with him.\u00a0 Pre-teachings, warnings\u2026we all need to be three steps ahead of where he will be to help his body and his brain connect. \n \u2013He\u2019s a one of a kind kid that doesn\u2019t fit any mold.\u00a0 A first (and only) edition.\u00a0 Traditional strict ABA methods will not always work with him.\u00a0 In many cases, his sensory issues need to be addressed first.\u00a0 Fill up his tank, and the behavior methods will fall into place.\u00a0 If he\u2019s left empty or is overflowing, his behavior plan will fall apart.\u00a0 It\u2019s a long journey with lots of ups and downs.\u00a0 But he will get there if you let him. \n \u2013We are constantly thinking on the fly and out of the box for Howie.\u00a0 When we do that, he cruises down the road like a finely tuned machine.\u00a0 Sit back and enjoy the ride. \n \n \n And finally, I gave suggestions for \u201cfilling his tank\u201d: \n \u2022In the classroom \n \u2013Circle time: something in his hands (tiny car, koosh ball, etc) \n \u2013Bean bag chairs for quiet reading time \n \u2013\u201cjobs\u201d to help with sensory inputs (stacking chairs, carrying containers of toys, cleaning the board) \n \u2013Headphones during work time \n \u2022Out of the classroom (when needed) \n \u2013Walks down the hall (delivering notes to the office, etc.) \n \u2013Jumps on the trampoline \n \u2013Walk outside around the building \n I concluded the presentation with a list of books and resources for them, with the strong reminder that Tim and I are their best resource.\u00a0 Use us.\u00a0 We have been living with this for 5 1/2 years. ********** We talked for a while about immediate changes to his schedule.\u00a0 No more mandatory breaks at scheduled times, with the exception of the one first thing in the morning.\u00a0 They needed to be on demand and honored.\u00a0 We talked about the need to listen to his words and watch his body.\u00a0 And we shared that he is already becoming very self-aware \u2013 knowing that he needs putty at circle time to help him focus and \u201cjobs\u201d to make him feel proud and accomplished.\u00a0 His aides said that they are encouraging his classroom teacher to call on him more, that just because he\u2019s not  looking her in the eye  when she\u2019s teaching, it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not attending. I stood up to leave and the special education teacher said to me: \u201cThank you.\u00a0 I see your child in a whole new light now.\u201d ********** There comes that time when we need to take a moment and step in for our children.\u00a0 No one else will do it for us.\u00a0 I believe in my son.\u00a0 I know he will move mountains if he\u2019s given the opportunity to try.\u00a0 I needed his teachers to see what he could do when he is feeling like Howie. I know in my heart they will get it. And if they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be right back there again leading the way.\u00a0 I believe in me too. hand in hand \u201c Try what you need to try, \n  No one should question why, \n  Believe in yourself, \n  Believe in yourself.  Folks may say you\u2019re different, \n  That you\u2019ve gone and lost your senses, \n  But the world is yours to walk in, \n  Go ahead and leap the fences.

{"date": "August 6, 2012", "body": "I almost lost my stuffing in the Hot Wheels suite talking about Howie. \u2013 a post to some friends on Friday afternoon. It came up casually in conversation with a new friend I met at the  BlogHer  conference this week.\u00a0  Jennifer  told me that she was looking forward to checking out the Hot Wheels suite since her boys liked cars. \u201cUm\u2026Hot Wheels Suite?\u201d I asked, and turned wide-eyed to my friend (and most awesome roommate ever  Kristin ). Hot Wheels, or more specifically Mattel, was a big sponsor of the conference.\u00a0 And they had a full suite on the 42nd floor of the hotel to show off their new products.\u00a0 There was no way I was missing that. Friday after lunch, Kristin and I made our way up to the suite. The marketing people showed off their products, including their new app game.\u00a0 Dan, the marketing guy for Mattel, demonstrated how a special Hot Wheels car drives on top of the iPad and \u201craces\u201d.\u00a0 You control the car through the race or you can have a leisurely drive through the city. I could feel my eyes tear up a little. I started to tell the marketing guy a little bit about Howie and his  four year long obsession  with Hot Wheels.\u00a0 How those cars were our connection to him.\u00a0 And how it was also our autism \u201cred flag\u201d. And then with the iPad \u2013 the device that helps him focus and learn and play without frustration\u2026well, the thought of combining the two was just a little much for me. We thanked him for his demonstration and turned to leave the suite.\u00a0 That\u2019s when I saw this and had to take a picture: Yes. Yes we do. ********** This afternoon, we were getting ready to go to Target to buy school supplies.\u00a0 Lewis was holding my phone for me while I packed up some snacks. \u201cWhat does this say?\u201d, he asked, pointing to my phone. I had the \u201cReal Moms Play Cars\u201d sign as the background picture on the phone.\u00a0 I told him what it said. An hour later, we found ourselves in the Hot Wheels aisle of Target because\u2026well, we always do.\u00a0 Lewis was trying to convince me that he needed yet another car because\u2026well, he always does. I said no.\u00a0 We had enough. \u201cIt\u2019s for you, Mom.\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t need a car.\u201d I replied. \u201cYes, you do.\u00a0 \u2018Real moms play cars.\u2019 You need your car.\u201d How does one say no to that?\u00a0 To a kid who just one year ago couldn\u2019t speak more than two words at a time? You don\u2019t.\u00a0 We came home with a new car for me and one for everyone else. ********** Before I left the conference, I sent Dan the Mattel marketing guy this e-mail: Dear Dan, \n I think you are the person I met at the Hot Wheels suite at BlogHer12. You showed my friend and me the new iPad game and gave us the demonstration on the remote control car. I told you my two youngest sons were autistic. And you remembered my son liked green. \n I have to tell you how Hot Wheels changed our lives. It became the vehicle, if you will, for communicating with my sons. It\u2019s how their dad connected with them, how their older brother plays with them. And I had to learn how to play with them too. \n So your \u201creal moms play cars\u201d sign meant so much. It has become my motto. If there\u2019s any way I could get one of those signs , I would appreciate it forever. ********** \u201cReal Moms Play Cars.\u201d I get down on the floor.\u00a0 That may not mean much to other moms. Howie chooses a car for me.\u00a0  But playing cars is the one way in to communicating with my boys. Lewis drives his car over to me. It\u2019s how we connect. He says \u201cHi, Mom\u2019s car.\u201d It\u2019s how we interact. Howie says \u201cWanna race?\u201d and whispers to me that he\u2019ll let Lewis win. It\u2019s how we healed as a family. Ready\u2026set\u2026go! Hot Wheels.\u00a0 Beat that! \u201c Baby you can drive my car \n  Yes I\u2019m gonna be a star \n  Baby you can drive my car \n  And maybe I\u2019ll love you \u201d \u2013 Drive My Car by The Beatles * this is one out of probably two or maybe three BlogHer posts* ********** If you could, please check out my new project.\u00a0 We\u2019re opening a sensory gym for special needs children.\u00a0 To open our doors, we need your help.\u00a0 Please check out our website at  SenseAbility Gym  and donate safely through PayPal  HERE \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogher.com/blogher-12", "http://anotherjennifer.com/", "http://runningtobestill.blogspot.com/", "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/obsession/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/realmoms.jpg", "http://www.senseabilitygym.com", "https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=V6AFF2XCAK36J"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/drive-my-car/", "title": "\n\t\t\tDrive My Car\t\t"},

{"date": "November 10, 2011", "body": "I really really needed something good this week. Who knew it would come in the form of homework? Howie\u2019s first homework assignment was a family project.\u00a0 \u201cThe turkey needs a disguise so he doesn\u2019t get caught for Thanksgiving!\u00a0 Return the disguised turkey by Monday, November 14th. \u201d Knowing that we had a hectic week coming up, I figured we should get this done sooner rather than later.\u00a0 And by \u201cwe\u201d I meant my husband Tim and Howie. I figured that the vegan in the family would enjoy keeping the turkey from becoming table food.\u00a0 In reality, he\u2019s much better at all-things-crafty.\u00a0 And all things cooking, cleaning, folding, etc. Tim took one look at the turkey and said \u201cI bet Howie wants to disguise him as a racecar driver.\u201d Sure enough, that was the plan. The two of them sat down at the table and planned out their turkey costume.\u00a0 Tim looked up pictures of racecar drivers on the internet and together they picked which one to copy.\u00a0 A red helmet.\u00a0 Checkerboard shirt.\u00a0 Green pants (Howie\u2019s favorite color).\u00a0 And black boots. They went to work. Cutting out the shirt Here was a kid who until just recently couldn\u2019t sit down to do\u2026much at all.\u00a0 A kid who couldn\u2019t cut along a line without getting frustrated.\u00a0 A kid who couldn\u2019t even hold a pencil the right way, let alone scissors. The turkey gets \"dressed\" I sat at the table with them, biting my tongue and fighting back tears.\u00a0 They were working so well together, like a finely tuned car.\u00a0 Tim was anticipating Howie\u2019s every stumble and would head it off at the pass.\u00a0 Howie reminded Tim of all that he could do and wanted to do by himself. \"You don't need to draw lines for me to cut the squares. I know where to cut\" Back and forth they chatted about the project, working as a team to decide where the next piece should go and why. \n\n \n \n Now smash that glue! Finally, the turkey was properly disguised. Hey...where did the turkey go? Just a racecar driver here...move along... That smile says it all.\u00a0 Actually, both their smiles say it all. Howie loved doing homework so much, that he asked to do more work at his work table before bed.\u00a0 Could we say no? Happy Veteran's Day! It wasn\u2019t that long ago that I thought he\u2019d never write his name, color a paper, or cut with scissors.\u00a0 And I know that it isn\u2019t long before homework becomes a fight and a struggle, and not a joy. But for right now, homework is a pretty cool thing in our house.\u00a0 Inspired by a dad who knew how to make it fun, and not a hardship.\u00a0 A \u201cfather and son thing\u201d.\u00a0 Pure cutting, pasting and coloring joy.\u00a0 In my book, that\u2019s all sorts of awesome.

I lit it last night in memory of my dad.\u00a0 The candle burns for 24 hours.\u00a0 This is the 12th time I\u2019ve lit it, remembering the day he died 13 years ago. My house is quiet.\u00a0 Everyone is asleep. This is the first time I\u2019ve watched it burn out alone. The wax is all but gone.\u00a0 Just the wick remains. There was never really any time to grieve, even from the beginning.\u00a0 Just days after he died, I was making the decision to step into his seat in the Vermont House of Representatives.\u00a0 My first answer was no, I can\u2019t fill those shoes.\u00a0 A day later, I couldn\u2019t think of anyone else who could.\u00a0 The Governor called a few days after that, appointing me to the seat.\u00a0 I was twenty-six and my days were filled with getting up to speed on legislation and buying fancy clothes. Each anniversary from there was just\u2026busy.\u00a0 I lit the candle but had my hands full.\u00a0 I went from the State House to marriage to full time parenthood in just a few years.\u00a0 There was never any time to reflect.\u00a0 Or grieve. The flame gives one last flicker.\u00a0 Then it\u2019s gone. I am so angry at what the cancer took from all of us.\u00a0 The years that my sister missed with him.\u00a0 She was just 13 when he died. He called her \u201chis gal\u201d.\u00a0 I was \u201ccurly top\u201d.  My heroic mother took it upon herself to be our rock, even though she had never had the time to grieve the passing of her own mother just a year before.  He missed my brother\u2019s graduation from graduate school.\u00a0 His wedding.\u00a0 My wedding.\u00a0  He missed knowing the three most precious boys who all have names after him.\u00a0 He missed watching his grandson pitch his first game. Their first steps, their first amazing words.  My boys want to know him.\u00a0 Gerry asks about his political career and talks about the injustices in the world.\u00a0 Howie told me \u201cIt\u2019s too bad your dad is dead.\u00a0 He can\u2019t make Hot Wheels tracks with you.\u201d\u00a0 I know my dad would see the humor and love in that. \n I am filled with such anger at the stupid cancer that took him from us.\u00a0 Pancreatic cancer is the same killer it was 13 years ago.\u00a0 A survival rate of just 5%. I\u2019m angry at all cancers.\u00a0 Too many members of my family have been in a battle against this indiscriminate disease: my mother, my mother-in-law, aunts, uncles and cousins.\u00a0 It\u2019s not fair.\u00a0 I hate you, cancer. \u00a0 You rip the innocence right out from underneath us all. I stare at the candle.\u00a0 I never know what to do with it once it\u2019s out.\u00a0 It seems weird to throw it away, but just as weird to keep it. I still have dreams about him some nights, thirteen years later.\u00a0 Sometimes I\u2019m talking to him.\u00a0 Sometimes it feels so real that when I wake up, I wonder if the whole thing is just a dream.\u00a0 There is still so much unfinished business between us.\u00a0 So many things I still need to know.\u00a0 So many stories that I need to hear again.\u00a0 I\u2019m starting to forget the little memories and I want to pass them on to my own boys.\u00a0 There is a  piece of him  in each one of them.\u00a0 I want them to know their history and it\u2019s getting harder for me to remember it all. I pick up the candle.\u00a0 It\u2019s still very warm. My dad had these big giant work boots that we used to walk around in when we were kids, like most kids do.\u00a0 In the Legislature, I never felt like I fit those boots.\u00a0 It never felt like it was mine.\u00a0 More like I was there to close a chapter for him, rather than start my own.  Those boots have always been so hard to fill.\u00a0 I think of all the things he was in his short life: a child, a spouse, a teacher, a counselor, a community leader, a first responder, an advocate for children.\u00a0  The candle stays warm in my hands.\u00a0 But I am shaking. I realize that I am all of those things now, in my own house.\u00a0 I am still my mother\u2019s child.\u00a0 Tim\u2019s wife.\u00a0 A teacher, counselor and first responder for my own children.\u00a0 And as I find my voice in advocating for my own children, I am helping others in my community speak for their children too. I have become my father\u2019s daughter.\u00a0 I have found my place. I am alone with the candle.\u00a0 I can finally grieve.

I\u2019ve written a lot about all the sensory challenges that my son Howie has.\u00a0 But my other two have their sensory \u201cthings\u201d too. As do I. I\u2019m a clear sensory avoider.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like hugs or being too close to people I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be the one to sit across the room on the chair rather than share a comfy couch.\u00a0 I can\u2019t stand it when someone sits right next to me in a movie theater, especially when there are still plenty of open seats.\u00a0 And at a party or gathering, I\u2019ll be the one holding up the wall in the corner, nursing the same drink all night so I don\u2019t lose my spot.\u00a0 That\u2019s just me.\u00a0 And really?\u00a0 Never touch my neck.\u00a0 Or feet.\u00a0 Off limits.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t worn a turtleneck or scarf since I was in grade school, and if I can avoid socks and boots, I\u2019m a happy person. I have my food issues too.\u00a0 If something doesn\u2019t smell or look right, I can\u2019t eat it.\u00a0 While I am a big fan of food in general, I have some serious texture issues.\u00a0 Like tomatoes.\u00a0 And olives.\u00a0 And a banana that is more than a day ripe.\u00a0 I\u2019m shuddering as I write. And of course, my fear of failure paralyzes me.\u00a0 I quit softball because I didn\u2019t want to try out.\u00a0 I worked my butt off in school because the thought of a bad grade terrified me.\u00a0 I retreat and read to escape. My oldest is a lot like that.\u00a0 He likes his personal space, and he likes it quiet.\u00a0 He can\u2019t stand it if his shirt is too tight on his neck.\u00a0 If the house gets too noisy or if someone in his class is clicking their pen, he\u2019s upset. His food needs to look just right or he won\u2019t eat it, and forget about mixing any food together.\u00a0 He\u2019ll play baseball but gets frustrated quickly with team competitive sports.\u00a0 He prefers to play the piano and read.\u00a0 He gets really good grades, but wants more from school than just rote work.\u00a0 He wants it to mean something. My youngest needs his socks to fit just right and his pajamas to be loose.\u00a0 I used to think that his meltdowns over spilled food were a sensory thing, but we discovered quickly that it was because he was missing out on food. And my husband\u2026well, this is my post not his.\u00a0 Let\u2019s just say that our two sensory avoiding/perfection seeking trees created some apples that didn\u2019t fall far from us.\u00a0 Or something like that. It\u2019s clear that somehow our kids got this from us. Somewhere in the mix, Howie came along as the lone sensory avoider  and  seeker.\u00a0 He\u2019s the only one with an actual sensory processing disorder diagnosis.\u00a0 And with that also came the autism spectrum diagnosis. So it was great interest and a knowing smile that I read the essay \u201cLike Mother, Like Son\u201d by Amanda in the book  Wit and Wisdom from the Parents of Special Needs Kids  (yes, that\u2019s the book I\u2019m in too!).\u00a0 I\u2019ve been a reader of Amanda\u2019s great blog  Confessions From HouseholdSix  for a while, and was so glad when she agreed to write a post for the  SPD Blogger Network  on her son\u2019s sensory issues.\u00a0 They received their  second autism diagnosis  in the their family about a month before we got our second one. In her essay, she writes: When I dreamed of what my children would be like, I dreamed they would be like me.\u00a0 They would get good grades in school.\u00a0 They would like to play sports.\u00a0 They would be involved in other academic activities after school as they got older.\u00a0 I never dreamed of the word autism. \n Autism has been a funny little word in our house.\u00a0 My oldest son was diagnosed later at age eight and a half.\u00a0 By this point I had realized that this child is me, only more intense.\u00a0 But he is me.\u00a0 Does that put me on the spectrum too?\u00a0 This is a question that my son\u2019s diagnosis has made me ponder often. She goes on to talk about all the sensory issues that she shares with her son, and they were so familiar.\u00a0 Clothing troubles?\u00a0 Check.\u00a0 Food issues?\u00a0 Check.\u00a0 Desire for perfection? Check. Her last paragraph sums it up nicely: Are these all traits of autism?\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to say.\u00a0 Does this mean I\u2019m on the spectrum too?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I do know that autism or not, I did get a child like mine. And this is, of course, what swirls around in my head all the time.\u00a0 Is my oldest on the spectrum too, like his brothers?\u00a0 Are we? It\u2019s a question that I\u2019m not sure has an answer, nor perhaps does there need to be one.\u00a0 We all know that the spectrum is broad and wide, and that everyone \u2013 EVERYONE \u2013 has some sensory issues.\u00a0 It\u2019s about how you cope with them.\u00a0 For Howie, he can\u2019t cope with them right now.\u00a0 So we\u2019re teaching him.\u00a0 And in that process, we\u2019re teaching his brothers \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 how to cope as well. I do know that seeing pieces of me in my kids gives me a better understanding of what they are going through, and gives me more patience and tolerance in helping them through the tough moments. That\u2019s what Amanda\u2019s essay did for me.\u00a0 Seeing myself in her words helped me be a better parent.\u00a0 Just another way that I feel a little less alone in this world. \u201c As we go down life\u2019s lonesome highway, \n Seems the hardest thing to do, \n Is to find a friend or two. \n That helping hand, someone who understands. \n And when you feel you\u2019ve lost your way, \n You\u2019ve got someone there to say, \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d Ooo-oooo. \n Say you, say me, say it for always, \n Aw, that\u2019s the way it should be. \n Say you, say me, say it together, naturally \u201d \u2013 Say You, Say Me by Lionel Richie Buy The Book - You'll Feel Less Alone too \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Parents-Special-Needs-Kids/dp/1463737467", "http://confessionsfromhh6.com/", "http://www.spdbloggernetwork.com/2011/10/07/who-knew-it-was-sensory/", "http://confessionsfromhh6.com/2011/08/coming-out-of-the-funk/", "http://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Parents-Special-Needs-Kids/dp/1463737467"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/say-you-say-me/", "title": "\n\t\t\tSay You, Say\u00a0Me\t\t"},
{"date": "September 6, 2012", "body": "Dear Mom at school pick up today, \u201cI have been there too.\u201d I\u2019m not even sure what else to say but that. I know that feeling.\u00a0 The one when you don\u2019t just think that all eyes are on you. You  know  they are. How could we not be watching?\u00a0 The screaming.\u00a0 The flailing.\u00a0 The teachers huddled around your child.\u00a0 And you. We were all right there the first day.\u00a0 We stood in the pouring rain as you tried to coax your son out of the school doors. In hushed tones we all chalked it up to first day jitters.\u00a0 I even joked about it to my friend standing next to me. \u201cMy son used to hate leaving school too.\u00a0 I\u2019d have to drag him out of here,\u201d I said with a nervous laugh. But something in me just knew. And then today as we all left school I glanced back at the playground and saw you there.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to leave.\u00a0 Kicking, screaming. Our fabulous teachers were sitting with you and him, keeping him safe as he melted down. You know we\u2019re trying to avert our eyes.\u00a0 And through the blinked back tears you appreciate it.\u00a0 You do. In the car, I let out those tears you were holding in. I was right there where you are.\u00a0 Just four short years ago. That was me.\u00a0 That was Howie.\u00a0 Our first year of preschool. I could hear him through the window as he screamed that he didn\u2019t want to leave.\u00a0 Every other child came out but mine.\u00a0 He would be carried out, flailing his arms and legs, yelling that he didn\u2019t want to go home.\u00a0 I stood there every morning with my eyes burning and a lump in my throat as I struggled to bring him out with one hand, balancing the 20 pound bucket car seat carrying baby Lewis in the other. I was crushed emotionally and physically. Those moments, for me, were my worst parenting moments.\u00a0 I felt like a failure.\u00a0 I could handle the meltdowns and the behavior issues at home.\u00a0 I could just let him line up his cars and stay in our house and watch the world go by out the window. But the public display outside of school put me on display. Everyone else\u2019s kid cries when they leave their parent for the first days of school.\u00a0 Not mine. Everyone else\u2019s kid runs into their parent\u2019s waiting arms when school is over.\u00a0 Not mine. I felt like the world was sitting in judgement of me.\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t he want to be home?\u00a0 What was she doing to him there? My only saving grace was that the staff at the school knew me personally.\u00a0 They knew I wasn\u2019t beating him or abusive in any way.\u00a0 They worked with me to create transition boards for Howie for school.\u00a0 I took some pictures of our daily after school activities and every morning I\u2019d let them know three things we were doing when we got home.\u00a0 Maybe it was lunch, playing with cars, and watching a show.\u00a0 Maybe it was a trip to Target.\u00a0 We soon discovered that it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to come home, but that he didn\u2019t know that the day would continue on with new activities.\u00a0 Slowly, we were able to get to a place of a smoother transition out of the classroom. The staff knew this wasn\u2019t about our home life, but more about Howie\u2019s ability \u2013 or inability \u2013 to transition from home to school and back to home. You see\u2026this was all before his life changing \u2013 and in many ways our life saving \u2013 autism spectrum diagnosis. So\u2026back to you, Mom at school. I\u2019m not saying that your son is on the spectrum.\u00a0 I don\u2019t presume to make those judgements or diagnoses.\u00a0 Maybe you already know what is going on with him. Maybe it\u2019s just a phase.\u00a0 Or maybe it isn\u2019t. And, if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re feeling stuck.\u00a0 The last thing you want is to draw attention to it all but you also want someone to step in.\u00a0 You want no one to see, yet you need someone to see it too.\u00a0 Someone to validate that it isn\u2019t just you failing as a parent. I\u2019m offering myself as that someone to you. I\u2019m not sure how to approach it, though.\u00a0 Had someone come up to me out of the blue, especially another parent, I might have rejected it outright.\u00a0 Said  \u201cnope, we\u2019re doing just fine, thank you .\u201d\u00a0 It took  a special teacher  to break through to me before I could be the one to reach out. So, if you\u2019re reading this\u2026next week I\u2019ll hang back a little at drop off and introduce myself.\u00a0 Just to say hello.\u00a0 First week of school and all that.\u00a0 The next morning, I may mention that I have boys too.\u00a0 I may mention how lucky we were to have this school in our town because they were so good with all three of my boys, especially my middle guy who had some issues leaving school too. I\u2019ll figure out someway to let you know that you\u2019re not alone. Some way to let you know \u201cI have been there.\u201d\u00a0 And some way to let you know it can \u2013 and does \u2013 get better. See you on Monday. Sincerely, Alysia At age 3.

{"date": "October 10, 2012", "body": "I have a million and one things jumbling around in my head. I want to write about them all.\u00a0 But I can\u2019t seem to get them out.\u00a0 They are stilted fragments of mixed up blog posts stuck in all different parts of my brain. So I needed something good.\u00a0 Something short.\u00a0 Something that made me smile. Yesterday in Howie\u2019s backpack, this came home: \u201cI used my fingers\u201d There are so many things I love about this.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a few: 1) He answered the question. 2) He answered it very literally.\u00a0 Because that\u2019s him.\u00a0 How did you count them?\u00a0 I used my fingers.\u00a0 Of course. 3) His teacher did NOT mark it wrong.\u00a0 Because it\u2019s not wrong.\u00a0 Was it the answer she expected?\u00a0 Nope.\u00a0 Is it right?\u00a0 Yup.\u00a0 This is what good teaching is.\u00a0 His teacher GETS him.\u00a0 She could have said that wasn\u2019t correct.\u00a0 Instead, she prompted him with another question about it to help him get to the next level.\u00a0 It takes me back to my friend  Stimey\u2019s post Not Even Wrong. \u00a0 Good \u2013 GREAT \u2013 teachers respect how our kids think, give them credit for that, and then work with them to see it from another perspective. 4) I love how he spelled out \u201cyoosd\u201d.\u00a0 Phonetically it\u2019s perfect.\u00a0 And another example to me of how tough our language is to learn \u2013 especially for literal, rule minded, pattern loving thinkers.\u00a0 Of which I have three in my house. 5) Howie\u2019s handwriting.\u00a0 It\u2019s better than my husband\u2019s.\u00a0 This kid struggled with holding a pencil from the start.\u00a0 You\u2019ve come a long way, baby. 6) My kid is doing math.\u00a0 And he\u2019s writing.\u00a0 And he\u2019s getting the concepts and generalizing them. Ask me if I thought this would be possible for first grade\u2026on second thought\u2026don\u2019t. There are so many ups and downs on this parenting rollercoaster.\u00a0 So many times my heart breaks a little for my kid when I watch how hard he struggles just to be comfortable in his own skin.\u00a0 So many many sleepless nights for us all. And then there\u2019s this.\u00a0 The progress that happens in an environment tailored to celebrate the successes of my child and challenge him to think in different ways.\u00a0 The willingness to think outside of the box for my kid to help him think outside of the box. That\u2019s worth celebrating in a blog post today. \u201cI built a bridge across the stream my consciousness \n  It always seems to be a flowin\u2019 \n  But I don\u2019t know which way my brain is goin\u2019 \n  Oh the rhymin\u2019 and the timin\u2019 \n  Keeps the melodies inside me \n  And they\u2019re comin\u2019 \n  Till I\u2019m running out of air \n  Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head \n  Are you listening to a single word I\u2019ve said Ha La La La La \n  Listen closer to the words I say \n  Ha La La La La \n  I\u2019m stickin\u2019 to the wordplay \u201d \u2013 Wordplay by Jason Mraz \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_20121010_121706.jpg", "http://www.stimeyland.com/2011/11/not-even-wrong/"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/10/10/wordplay/", "title": "\n\t\t\tWordplay\t\t"},
{"date": "September 24, 2012", "body": "Yes, I know that\u2019s not a real song. But I had no other way to title this.\u00a0 It\u2019s an original title for a brand new project of mine. It\u2019s perhaps the most important thing I\u2019ve done since marrying my husband and starting my incredible family. My very dear friend and I are opening a parent-led sensory gym.\u00a0 As a non-profit. For kids just like mine. We\u2019re calling it \u201c SenseAbility Gym: A Sensory Gym for Sensational Kids \u201c. But first\u2026the back story. ********** This winter, my friend and I took our sons to an open sensory gym in sponsored by the  Autism Alliance of Metrowes t.\u00a0 We watched our boys run around and play and smile.\u00a0 The equipment was familiar to the boys from their OT sessions at school so they knew just how to use it.\u00a0 As a bonus, my friend and I got to actually talk to one another.\u00a0 A few weeks later, we attended another sensory open gym, again sponsored by the Autism Alliance, this time at a private OT clinic.\u00a0 Again, the boys were in heaven.\u00a0 Jumping into ball pits, climbing through the squeeze machine, swinging around on the therapeutic swings.\u00a0 And again, we got to talk.\u00a0 Mostly about how we wished there was something like this open near us all year round. I wrote about  our experience there in my blog .\u00a0 I talked about how welcoming it was.\u00a0 How one child kept telling everyone it was a leap year and reciting the other years when a leap year had occurred.\u00a0 How Howie made a new friend there who loved to spin around in the closed up swing as much as he did.\u00a0 How  happy  our kids were.\u00a0 And that no one there batted an eye if a kid was upset, or melting down, or jumping up and down, or making noises, or making eye contact or not.\u00a0 It was pure acceptance and love for our kids. Such a happy face! My husband Tim read it, saw Howie\u2019s happy face in the pictures, and casually said \u201cYou should open a place like that.\u201d I\u2019m not sure he actually meant it. But I started to cry.\u00a0 Because I knew we had to open a place like that. The next night, I went out with a few friends for drinks.\u00a0 All autism moms. I told them what Tim said.\u00a0 They said we had to do it. The next morning, I went for a walk with another friend.\u00a0 She\u2019s been my friend since our oldest boys were in preschool together. I told her to talk me out of it.\u00a0 She talked me more into it.\u00a0 And handed me a book on how to start a non-profit in Massachusetts. The more we talked to people: parents of kids with special needs, parents of kids without special needs, therapists, teachers, you name it.\u00a0\u00a0 Not one person told us it was a bad idea.\u00a0 In fact, they all said we had to do this. We met with a business consultant to organize our thoughts.\u00a0 We relied on people in our community who took their personal time to sit with us and tell us what we needed to do to make this work.\u00a0 We sent out a survey and wrote a business plan.\u00a0 We asked my cousin to design our website and our incredible logo. We filed with the state as a nonprofit, with the attorney general\u2019s office as a public charity, and received our 501(c)3 status from the IRS faster than anyone said it would happen. And so SenseAbility Gym, Incorporated was born. ********** So what are we?\u00a0 What are we trying to do? And why am I writing about this here? SenseAbility Gym\u2019s mission is to provide a parent-led sensory gym, giving children with special needs a safe, fun, indoor area where they can play and accommodate their sensory needs.\u00a0 This will be the first of its kind in the Metrowest area of Massachusetts.\u00a0 We\u2019re modeling our gym after  an incredibly successful sensory gym in Brooklyn, NY . We believe in the fact that all children deserve access to the types of therapeutic equipment used in their schools and their private occupational therapy clinics and we believe that parents need to interact with their children to learn what helps their child \u201cfeel better\u201d and have fun. There are four important components to our mission. \n Community: SenseAbility Gym wants its members to feel welcome, and part of the special needs community. \n Safe Sensory Play: SenseAbility Gym wants parents of children with special needs to feel there is a safe place to bring their children for fun, exercise and sensory support. \n Acceptance: SenseAbility Gym will have an environment that recognizes that all special needs children are different and that all learning styles, personalities, and abilities are welcome. \n Support: SenseAbility Gym will be a place where families of special needs children can go to meet other families who share the same struggles. \n Through this blog, I\u2019ve connected with special needs parents all over the country and the world.\u00a0 The one common statement that most parents say is \u201cI feel so alone.\u00a0 My child is the only one that has these extra special needs. I have no one to turn to for support.\u201d My friend and I know how lucky we are to live where we do.\u00a0 From the moment that we knew Howie needed extra help, we had people to help us.\u00a0 Our pediatrician referred us to Early Intervention to get help for his sensory issues from an occupational therapist.\u00a0 When he entered preschool, he was surrounded by a loving, caring, knowledge group of teachers and support staff who knew before we did what Howie needed.\u00a0 And when he received his autism diagnosis, we were instantly supported by this team here in town to get him the services he needed.\u00a0 And through that, he made friends.\u00a0 And I made friends.\u00a0 And without that\u2026I don\u2019t like to think about it. We see the gym as a place not only for our kids and kids like ours to accommodate their sensory needs, but also as a place to build their social skills and interact with other children like them.\u00a0 We see the gym as a place where moms and dads can interact with parents just like them. As Howie told me the other night: \u201cSenseAbility Gym is a place where kids can learn to get along.\u201d We see it as an another piece of the support team helping families know they are not alone. ********** I\u2019m going to get numerical here for a moment.\u00a0 We know that as many as one in six children have sensory processing issues. That is from the  SPD Foundation . The CDC reports that 5.4 million children between the ages of 4-17 have been diagnosed at some point in their lives with ADHD in 2007 and that number is rising.\u00a0 We know that 1 in 88 children \u2013 1 in every 54 boys \u2013 are diagnosed as on the autism spectrum. Taking a small seven mile radius around our town \u2013 the distance that people in our survey said they would travel for a service like ours \u2013 we know we have the potential of connecting with over 400 families who could use the gym.\u00a0 We\u2019re guessing that people will travel farther and the actual number will be even higher. That is over four hundred families that could finally connect and say \u201cMe too.\u201d ********** And this is where you come in. I need your help.\u00a0 As a non-profit public charity, we are completely reliant on donations, grants, and our membership dues to stay open.\u00a0 None of us are taking a salary.\u00a0 All the money we raise goes right back into keeping the gym open and running: rent, electricity, equipment, furniture, insurance. Our gym will be located in Hopedale, MA.\u00a0 There will be one large open space with equipment like therapy swings, a scooter board ramp, a ball pit, and tunnels, balancing equipment and a squeeze machine.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have one quiet \u201csensory\u201d room with crash pads and low lights and calming activities.\u00a0 And one classroom space for us to hold social skills or life skills classes, or to be used as a sensory-friendly homework room for children who need that to get their work done. Families will be able to purchase memberships to access open gym times with their children.\u00a0 In addition, we plan to offer sensory based group activities, and have the gym available for private therapists to use with children and their parent. We would like to have our grand opening in January 2013.\u00a0 To do that, we need $38,000 to open our doors.\u00a0 That includes purchase of all the equipment and furniture for the gym. We are actively pursuing local and national grants to help get us closer to that number. I need you to tell people about us .\u00a0 Maybe you know a family who has a child with special needs in our area who could benefit from a membership at the gym.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s your own family.\u00a0 Maybe you work for a company that is generous with community giving.\u00a0 Maybe you know children who need to raise money as a community service project and they would like to purchase a piece of equipment. I need you \u2013 my friends and family \u2013 to help make this gym a reality.\u00a0 Not just for my kids or my friend\u2019s kids. But for mom who told me at our town\u2019s Day In The Park that her daughter needs a place like this. For the parents sitting in an Early Intervention family group right now wondering where they could find a safe place to meet once their kids turn three. For the dad who is desperately looking for a way to connect with his autistic son, but can\u2019t afford the play equipment his child needs. Every dollar donated  goes to the gym and those families. It\u2019s a balancing act ********** Last night, we held our first fundraiser in our town.\u00a0 The above is the speech I gave to the packed house that came for food, wine, chocolate, coffee and conversation.\u00a0 The room was filled with family and friends and strangers who are now friends.\u00a0 The most amazing part was it was not all people with special needs children.\u00a0 It was our community. It was teachers, parents, friends, therapists, and business leaders.\u00a0 They came because they wanted to support something that will benefit everyone. We had a \u201csensory table\u201d manned by my son Gerry and his friend.\u00a0 She\u2019s an amazing young lady who, like my son, understands how much swings and fidgets and weighted blankets and headphones help their siblings \u201cfeel better\u201d. We raised a lot of money last night.\u00a0 We\u2019re just under 40% of our goal. But we still need you. Clicking  HERE  takes you right to our PayPal donation page.\u00a0 We are a 501(c)3 organization and your donation is tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.\u00a0 Every dollar goes towards get our doors open. I want to be able to come here in January and post pictures of our grand opening.\u00a0 I cannot wait to see the smiling faces on the kids that come through. And their parents. On behalf of my friend and every family that this will help, thank you for reading. To read the news story about our fundraiser, click  HERE . To read more about our plans, click  HERE .

{"date": "October 26, 2012", "body": "E-mail I sent to Howie\u2019s teachers this morning: Just wanted to give you a heads up with Howie and the upcoming hurricane.\u00a0 Howie is very sensitive to big changes in barometric pressure.\u00a0 I am as well\u00a0 but while it manifests itself in the form of a headache for me for Howie it causes big behavior changes.\u00a0 His vestibular system gets rocked when the pressure drops.\u00a0 I know it sounds weird, but we\u2019ve seen it several times, including  the last hurricane  and that summer when the tornadoes rolled through western MA.\u00a0 It\u2019s usually about 24-48 hours before the actual weather event comes in. \n With this upcoming hurricane, I just read that the pressure will drop incredibly low.\u00a0 Based on the track of the storm, Sunday is more likely to be Howie\u2019s harder day, but he could start feeling it as soon as today and into Monday.\u00a0 If you see extra stimming, or he seems out of whack, it\u2019s probably that. \n Hopefully we won\u2019t be hit too hard! At least it\u2019s not snow! These are the types of e-mails I write lately. The news today is full of reports of a \u201cFrankenstorm\u201d as Hurricane Sandy heads towards the east coast.\u00a0 Forecasters are calling for an incredible drop in barometric pressure as it hits land sometime late Monday and into Tuesday. And so I write e-mails about meteorology and storm tracking and sensory processing disorder. I know that for some people this connection makes no sense.\u00a0 As in \u201creally?\u00a0 The weather affects your kid\u2019s behavior? Come on.\u00a0 Weather changes were something that made old people complain about their aches and pains, but it\u2019s not really  real . \u201d It\u2019s just an excuse for his bad behavior. I\u2019ve been at this long enough with my kid to tell you.\u00a0 It\u2019s real. I get headaches and neck aches right before a storm comes through.\u00a0 When Hurricane Irene passed near us last summer, it felt like someone was standing on my head. I can verbalize it.\u00a0 I can explain what is happening and why.\u00a0 And people understand it. My son can\u2019t explain it why all of a sudden he needs to run laps or crash into things or spin in circles and stim.\u00a0 His reactions to the same trigger look like behavior problems. It sounds like hooey to someone who doesn\u2019t live it.\u00a0 But I\u2019ve tracked it.\u00a0 Storms, moon phase changes, illness\u2026all these things affect my son\u2019s sensory system. They probably affect all of our sensory systems. But most people have learned to cope with how we\u2019re feeling.\u00a0 A few extra Tylenol.\u00a0 Or a nap. Howie is still learning what makes him more regulated.\u00a0 He knows what activities make him feel better but he has yet to figure out the trigger or how to do it most \u201cappropriately\u201d for the setting. I\u2019m not making excuses for how he\u2019s acting. If he\u2019s being unsafe or not able to be in the classroom then he needs to be removed, redirected and helped.\u00a0 Unacceptable behavior is still unacceptable behavior. I will however be proactive in helping those around him understand what is a sensory response versus what is a behavior so he doesn\u2019t get into trouble for something he can\u2019t control. So that maybe he gets an extra sensory break during the day.\u00a0 Or two visits to the OT room versus just one.\u00a0 Or just a well trained eye on him looking for signs of discomfort and dysregulation. And hopefully we can teach him why he\u2019s feeling the way he does so that next time, he has the tools he needs to cope and feel better. So I send e-mails warning of Hurricane Howie as Hurricane Sandy approaches. At home, we\u2019re stocking up on Stonyfield yogurts, fruit leather and flameless candles and padding the house with pillows and bean bag chairs for safe crashing. Getting ready to weather any storm that comes our way. Got our umbrellas ready \u201c Squalls out on the gulf stream, \n Big storms coming soon. \n  I passed out in my hammock, \n  God, I slept way past noon. \n  Stood up and tried to focus, \n  I hoped I wouldn\u2019t have to look far. \n  I knew I could use a Bloody Mary, \n  So I stumbled next door to the bar .\u201d \u2013 Trying To Reason With Hurricane Season by Jimmy Buffett \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2011/08/28/like-a-hurricane/", "https://trydefyinggravity.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_20121019_170859.jpg"], "link": "https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/trying-to-reason-with-hurricane-season/", "title": "\n\t\t\tTrying To Reason With Hurricane\u00a0Season\t\t"},
{"date": "November 14, 2012", "body": "My friends. Just when you thought you were all done with voting for a while\u2026 Now  I  need your vote. SenseAbility Gym , the sensory gym that we are opening in Massachusetts, is up for a chance at a $25,000 grant from  FedEx .\u00a0 Businesses from all over the country are competing for this money in an online contest. Here\u2019s what we wrote: SenseAbility Gym was established in May of 2012 as a sensory gym for special needs kids. As moms of children with autism, we have found that there are a couple occupational therapy centers in the area that occasionally offer public open gym time, but there is nothing in the area that provides the year round open gym services. With the autism rate rising to 1 in 88 children, we knew many special needs families needed a place for their children to play safely and find support and acceptance. We\u2019re a non-profit relying on donations, grants and fees paid by families who will use our gym. There is no other business like ours in central Massachusetts that provides the services that we will. We believe that children deserve access to the equipment used in their schools and therapy clinics. This will be a place where parents and children can go to socialize with other families with similar challenges. Our community needs this grant to get our doors open for these families and stay open. The $25,000 grant will go directly into the programming and operation of the gym. We need specific therapeutic equipment for the gym that is expensive (things like therapy swings and safety mats). We are also offering specialized classes for kids in social skills and life skills and the money will go towards offering those at reduced rates. This grant will allow us to use other private donations for direct operating costs, giving us the rest of the money we need to open to the gym for families. We need your vote today.\u00a0 And every day until November 24th. Click  HERE  to vote directly. Click  HERE  to join our Facebook event page for information and reminders to vote.

{"date": "October 28, 2012", "body": "There are times when I realize that my oldest knows too much. Like the other day when Howie was bouncing off the walls after school and Gerry asked me if he had had a good day at school.\u00a0 When I answered \u201cYes\u201d he replied with \u201cI could tell.\u00a0 He held it together all day at school and is letting it go now at home where it\u2019s safe.\u201d Yeah.. . And then there was tonight. ********** I was working on dinner.\u00a0 We had just received the call that school was cancelled for tomorrow due to the hurricane. Gerry was on the couch about to start a game on the Playstation.\u00a0 Howie was rocking back and forth in his  beloved green chair  right next to the TV. The verbal stimming had started.\u00a0 For Howie, this is his \u201csilly words\u201d.\u00a0 He yells out a string of nonsense words while he sits in the chair. For the sensory avoiders in our house (my husband, Gerry and myself), the sounds are our trigger. I\u2019ve worked hard with Howie to remind him that he can make his silly words but he needs to either do it quietly or in another room if someone is trying to watch a show or play a game. Many times, this scene ends with Gerry yelling at Howie to stop.\u00a0 Conflicting sensory overloads. Gerry started. \u201cHey Howie!\u201d I braced myself. \u201cHey Howie.\u00a0 I\u2019m about to start my game.\u00a0 If you have silly words, can you let them all out now before I start a new level?\u201d I froze. \u201cOkay,\u201d came the answer.\u00a0 Followed by a thirty second long string of loud sounds and words. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0 And Gerry started his game. I still didn\u2019t move. About five minutes in, Howie looked at Gerry and said \u201cWait!\u00a0 I have more.\u201d Gerry paused his game.\u00a0 Howie let another string of sounds and words out.\u00a0 Then stopped. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d Gerry turned to Howie. \u201cThank you for warning me.\u00a0 I appreciate it.\u201d He glanced over at me. I mouthed \u201cThank you.\u201d And game playing started again. ********** I know I ask a lot of Gerry.\u00a0 And a lot of what I ask is conflicting and confusing.\u00a0 I ask him to understand his brother and tolerate his behaviors, yet I reprimand him when he steps into the role of parent.\u00a0 I want him to know why his brothers do what they do, but then ask him to do things that go against his own sensory sensitivities. My kid takes on more than he should and yet I need him to. Tonight, he showed acceptance and understanding.\u00a0 And in the most loving way possible. His way. My boys in pink. For breast cancer awareness day at school. Gerry told Howie that his tie was \u201cawesome\u201d.

{"date": "March 22, 2012", "body": "There was another hero there that  morning with Eustacia Cutler . He was sitting two seats over from me.\u00a0 A man, slightly balding, sitting quietly just like the rest of us. I was so engrossed in Mrs. Cutler\u2019s words that I didn\u2019t even notice him. Until he stood up to speak during the Q&A session. He raised his hand and was given the microphone.\u00a0 His voice shook a little. He introduced himself as a 55 year old man with a brother with autism. His brother is non-verbal.\u00a0 He wants help and advice from Mrs. Cutler on how to reach him.\u00a0 Or, more directly, can he still be reached? \u201cOf course,\u201d replies Mrs. Cutler.\u00a0 She\u2019s trying to feel him out more, get more information on what he means and how he connects now with his brother. \u201cWe were estranged for a long time.\u00a0 I\u2019ve just started to see him again.\u00a0\u00a0 You see, Mrs. Cutler\u2026\u201d His voice trails a little. \u201cMy parents did the reverse of what you did.\u00a0 My parents put all their focus on me and my other siblings.\u00a0 Not my brother.\u00a0 It was no fault of theirs.\u00a0 It was they knew to do at the time.\u201d I let out all the air I had been holding in.\u00a0 My friend  Jess  touches my shoulder.\u00a0 She knows.\u00a0 This is too much. The sibling thing.\u00a0 The balance.\u00a0 The feeling like you\u2019re sacrificing one child\u2019s needs for another.\u00a0 Not knowing what is right or wrong but just hoping you\u2019re doing the right thing. Mrs. Cutler writes in the preface of \u201c A Thorn In My Pocke t\u201d that her other three children asked not to be included in book.\u00a0 She writes\u00a0 \u201cWhile trying to help Temple, I left them in the dark. Temple and Daddy were the stars \u2013 the siblings and I, minor constellations circling uneasily around them.\u201d She said that autism needs to be viewed as a family issue.\u00a0 That all the family members need counseling on the disorder.\u00a0 Too often, she said, the siblings become helpers.\u00a0 \u201cChildren should be children,\u201d she said. And here was this man \u2013 this 55 year old man \u2013 still coping with trying to figure it all out.\u00a0 After fifty-five years, autism was still an family issue. ********** I knew I had to talk with him. After getting my book signed, I went up to the man. \u201cHi,\u201d I said, \u201cI just wanted you to know how much it meant to me to hear your question about how to connect with your brother.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s pretty incredible that you\u2019ve found your way back to him.\u00a0 I have three boys, and my middle one is on the spectrum.\u201d ( yes, I said just my middle one.\u00a0 Somehow, my subconscious forgets that I have  two  kids on the spectrum.   I don\u2019t even want to think about what that implies.\u00a0 It\u2019s clear where my energy goes.\u00a0 I\u2019m ashamed to even admit that. Can we just move along\u2026) \u201cOh, thank you,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s been great. You know, my parents.\u00a0 They did the best they could.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t know\u2026they didn\u2019t know.\u201d He continued. \u201cHe\u2019s up in Montreal and I go to visit him when I can. I bring my kids to see him.\u201d \u201cI think that\u2019s wonderful.\u00a0 It\u2019s great that they get to be with their uncle.\u201d I was smiling.\u00a0 My eyes were teary. \u201cYeah, it is.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if it really means anything to him, though. He seems happy to see me.\u00a0 He likes to go out to eat, so we always do that when I see him.\u00a0 He has his coat on already when I get there.\u201d I gulped.\u00a0 Swallowing the tears. \u201cWell, there you go,\u201d I said. \u201cYou are connecting with him.\u00a0 It does mean something to him.\u00a0 You found your  thing .\u00a0 I think that\u2019s everything.\u00a0 My oldest\u2026he struggles to find that connection with his brother.\u00a0 I\u2019m so glad that you\u2019ve found yours.\u201d \u201cWell, yes.\u00a0 I guess I have,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you for sharing that with me.\u201d I shook his hand and said good-bye.\u00a0 I turned back to Jess and tried to breathe. ********** That night, Gerry came over to the dinner table and slumped into his chair. \u201cWhen will Howie open the Lego sets he got for his birthday?\u201d I looked over and there were two Lego building sets on the floor.\u00a0 Howie had opened all his birthday presents and was playing with them one by one.\u00a0 This is the classic difference between my two boys.\u00a0 Howie opens one at a time, and perseverates on that one toy.\u00a0 Then\u2026moves on.\u00a0 Gerry needs to open them all and put everything together immediately.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t stand the fact that the Lego set had been sitting there all day. \u201cHe will get to it.\u00a0 Be patient.\u201d \u201cBut I told him I would help him with it.\u00a0 I want to do this with him.\u00a0 Why won\u2019t he open it?\u201d \u201cHe will.\u00a0 It\u2019s his set.\u00a0 In the meantime, why don\u2019t you play with what he\u2019s playing with?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sick of Hot Wheels,\u201d Gerry muttered. \u201cI just wanted to find that one thing that we both liked doing together.\u201d He slunk off, back up to the safe haven of his room. ******** The man that I met that morning had his connection.\u00a0 After all these years, he found his way back to his brother. They were bonding over their love of restaurants, connecting without even knowing it was happening. He\u2019s a hero.\u00a0 A man who went against everything he knew and forged a path back to the brother he loved.\u00a0 Unconditionally. Sigh. I know someday my boys will be heroes too.

I could light it up blue for the  women in my support group , who have given me the gifts of laughter and strength. I could light it up blue for the  people I have met  since my son\u2019s autism diagnosis who are always there no matter what time zone they are in now. I could light it up blue for my friends who have fought so hard for the appropriate educational placement for their child. I could light it up blue for the children diagnosed this year and the thousands more to be diagnosed in the years to come. I could light it up blue for the  families who drive by my house  so they know they aren\u2019t alone. But the most important reason I light it up blue? I light it up blue for my family. So I can show them that there are other families just like ours. So they know that the stigma does not exist in our house. So my boys know that what makes them different makes them special. So their brother sees that we\u2019re part of something global. So he feels less alone. So WE feel less alone. On our first World Autism Awareness Day, we looked like this: April 2, 2010 Then we looked like this: April 2, 2011 And today we look like this: April 2, 2012 I can see the progress in these pictures.\u00a0 I can see the hard work and the tears and the love.
