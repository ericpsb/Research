{"date": "April 01, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\r\n A year ago, I sat on a plane on the first day of Autism Awareness Month and watched five straight hours of CNN coverage. I remember being deeply impressed by the commitment of the CNN staffers, some of whom had children on the spectrum themselves. \u00a0One segment was about a center in Qatar for children with special needs. A few weeks later, I received an email from a woman who'd read one of my posts. She lived in the United Arab Emirates and was concerned about her son; so much so that she contacted a stranger in the United States for advice.\u00a0I didn't know where she was exactly, but I told her about the Shafallah Center in Qatar. To this day I have no idea whether they were able to help her, or if she even contacted them, but it reminded me of how small the Internet makes the world. With so little really known about autism, our kids' lives are deeply affected by information passed from one of us to another: in a word, folklore.Here we are again: it's Autism Awareness Month, and we're going to be hearing a lot of folklore in the next 30 days. It'll be the usual drumbeat of causation theories, therapies, inspiring, grim and sensationalist stories and semi-celebrities flogging their books on Oprah.\u00a0Makes you want to check into a hotel, throw a blanket over the TV and sleep for a few weeks, doesn't it?*Tonight as I tucked Isaac into bed, I couldn't stop thinking about the onslaught of autismania we'll be seeing this month. I looked down at Isaac as he sleepily clutched his stuffed bunny, and I thought if people really understood the incredible strength and beauty and humor of our kids, how hard they work, what the world looks and feels and smells and sounds like to them, we wouldn't have to spend so much time fighting for awareness, and beyond that, acceptance.Enough Rain Man, enough sensationalism, enough scary and irresponsible stories. Enough. You've heard of autism: now look at the kids.Here's mine. He'll be six this summer, he loves buses and pizza and reading and climbing, and he laughs when he learns new words.Now. Tell me about your kid. Your brother or sister. You.If you are on Twitter, I invite you to post a photo of someone you love with autism. At the end of the post, tag it \u00a0#waad (for World Autism Awareness Day) and\u00a0#hereweare.Here we are.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.shafallah.org.qa/", "http://twitter.com", "http://twitter.com/timeline/home#search?q=waad", "http://twitter.com/search?q=%23hereweare#search?q=%23hereweare"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2009/04/autism-beyond-awareness-to-another-kind-of-understanding.html", "title": "Here We Are"},
{"date": "October 19, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tWithout going into too much detail on the other day's freak out, I wanted to share a few thoughts on what prompted it and where we are now.  It came about as a result of an email that raised questions about Isaac's progress in certain areas.  Like so many professional communications, it was written with one set of objectives in mind (to detail certain areas which, with more understanding, would help his team better target interventions for him: correct and responsible) but read entirely differently to us (to wit, \"Guess what? Your child is a whole lot more broken than you thought.\")  It sent me, and my usually-unflappable J., into an emotional tailspin that, well, we thought we'd emerged from.  Hoped, anyway.\n\nThe net of it: the questions were questions: not implications.  The intent was laudable: to hone in on things that would better help my son with certain situational challenges.  The person who sent it is a lovely, compassionate, responsible professional, and genuinely appreciates my kid for who he is.  All the elements were there for a fine old dialogue about how to do a better job for Isaac.   All good, no?\n\nBut it hit us like a ton of bricks, and brought me back to a line in one of Isaac's earliest speech evaluations that became emblematic of the surreal nightmare that the evaluation process would become.  The line in question?  \"No drooling was observed.\"  \"No drooling?!?!\" I remember saying to Jesse in the car one day.  \"That's just great.  He didn't drool. I am so grateful that they pointed that out to us.\"  And I followed that comment with some other choice phrases that, for reasons of respect and human decency, I'll spare you.   \n\nYou see, no one bothered to tell us why they would even mention drooling in a speech evaluation.  There I was, back in Rain Man Land, imagining an unfurling future tape loop of \"Ten minutes to Wapner,\" and no one took the time to explain that drooling, which as an image of cognitive dysfunction has a symbolic weight equal only to that of dark matter, is simply a sign of oral-motor weakness, which might correlate with poor articulation.  Long story short: your kid needs to exercise his mouth muscles more.  Oh. \n\nAnd so I submit this to you as an example of how, even with the best of intentions, we sometimes get our lines crossed, we parents and professionals.  And how hard, even with the best and kindest teams, we need to work to communicate with each other.  Ironic, huh?  We're supposed to be good at this.  But I suppose if I have any wisdom about this now, it's to try to separate the words from the intent.  And go from there.\n\nThe hell of it is that, even with all the love and respect and faith we have in our kids, we can still be so raw and vulnerable to the most fleeting comment or sign of judgment.  That's one of the side-effects of being on this particular bus.  \n\nThanks to all of you who left comments, or emailed, or sent cyber-hugs.  \n\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/10/mind-the-gap.html", "title": "Mind the Gap"},
{"date": "April 05, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\r\n We had friends over last night, and talked, you know, about things. \u00a0One of the odd paradoxes we discussed is the fact that children on the spectrum (most children, actually) crave a sense of structure and like to know what's coming next. At the same time, our kids have a particular tendency to become anxious about transitions, even if they are transitions to something they dearly want. \u00a0So it is sometimes a delicate balancing act, the act of telling. Or you can call it by its real name: a crapshoot.So I, uh, didn't really tell Isaac that we were going to have dinner guests. When the doorbell rang, he became a bit agitated, naming his regular babysitters in near-chronological order and insisting that it wasn't them. And it wasn't.We set up the kids in Isaac's room with trains, cars and books, and, after a while, left them to play in proximity if not actually together. After a while, I heard a familiar pound-pound-pound down the hallway. One rosy cherubic face popped in, grinned, then another. Then pound-pound-pound down the hallway again. \u00a0And back. \"We're chasing us!\" Isaac crowed, clearly delighted with himself and his companion. I was so bowled over at the spontaneity that I couldn't have cared less about the pronouns.\u00a0It didn't last long (which the downstairs neighbors probably appreciated), but it was progress. Oh, and I made Kung Pao Chicken.*If you're looking for two beautiful things to read this week, I recommend Paul Collins' piece in Cookie about how to include a child with autism in your birthday parties, and my friend Kristen's piece about what lies beyond awareness.Off to the kitchen. Grandpa and Nonna flew in today from the East Coast (they hit the jackpot; it's a gorgeous 76 degrees here) and I am about to crack open a bottle of Albarino and make shrimp with snowpeas for family dinner.\u00a0P.S.

{"date": "February 10, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tLast night, as I lay next to my 3 1/2-year-old son, willing him to go to sleep already, I started thinking about everything I've learned in the past two years since we got our diagnosis: what it means to get a diagnosis, what to expect---and not expect--from the medical community, how to find therapists and figure out if they're any good, how to deal with insurance, how to deal with birthday parties and family gatherings and school and toys and haircuts and airplanes and food and sleeping and well-meaning strangers and work and the grocery store and bathtime and babysitters and the car wash, which Web sites are useful and which ones leave you breathless at 3 a.m. with the anguish of parents struggling to understand what is happening to their families. \n\nAnd I've learned more about who \"gets it\": which therapists and teachers see my son as the lovely and unique guy that he is, who sees him as a set of symptoms, and how to deal with that and advocate for him.\n\nI've learned to trust my gut, my husband and, most importantly, my son.\n\nI can't tell you it's easy to do this. Both my husband and I work full time. We don't live close to family who can help us on a daily basis. We don't get out a whole lot. But we have good help, and a wonderful extended family of people who who have helped us tremendously. Our son has a lot of potential, we're told. And we have slowly built a collection of tips, resources and understanding about where we are and what we have to do from here. So this blog will be our place to share the stuff that we've found to be useful.\n\nYesterday the CDC released a report that nearly one in 150 children has autism. There are a lot of us, and more every day, so we'd better figure out a way to help each other out. \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/02/08/autism.prevalence.ap/index.html"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/02/welcome_to_the_.html", "title": "Welcome to the Family Room"},

{"date": "April 20, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t There's something about this kind of writing that seems sto express the way the brain works. I started this weblog back in February 2007, at a point when Isaac's speech had really begun to kick in and we were in about eighteen flavors of crisis about what it all meant.\u00a0He liked to spin a lot then, and would often twirl or demand that his father or I pick him up and spin him around. \"He never gets dizzy,\" people would marvel, as if he had accomplished something special. \"Yeah, that's actually not so great,\" I'd say if I was in the mood for a little Sensory Integration 101. \u00a0\"It means his brain isn't fully receiving the signal that his body is moving.\"\u00a0Isaac doesn't spin much anymore, and when he does, he gets dizzy much more quickly. Those pathways--some of them, anyway--have found each other.\u00a0I read an article by Stephen Johnson in today's Wall Street Journal about how E-Books will change the way we read, and I can already see so many of these patterns in the way I communicate. \u00a0I might be writing about Isaac and thinking about how, lately, he loves bus-riding, and it'll remind me of Ben and his recitation of all the Thomas trains.\u00a0Or I'll be thinking about Nik and his unexplained pain, wondering why the medical world has so much trouble tracking down the source of something so powerful and debilitating. Or what\u00a0GP or Leelo is doing today. Link, Link, Link.It takes me on a journey, and if you're game, it brings you along for the ride, even if you don't choose to get off at every stop. It's not a hike; it's a meander, and you never know exactly where it'll lead.And so, as I see my own world increasingly linked, I see evidence that my son's brain is developing associations as well; some good, some funny, some not so good. I see the unexpected joys in his particular neurological arrangement, and the pain as he crashes against his anxieties over and over again. They're always mostly the same, and sometimes a little bit different.As J. remarked last night, Isaac is increasingly able to work through his feelings and come out the other side. It may not always be pretty, but bit by bit, those linkages are giving way to new and finer strands and tendrils and fronds and branches.\u00a0More paths, more possibilities; the power of a network unfolding.Like Johnson, I won't ever be able to give up the discipline and pleasure of a straight read through a big book: it's who I am. \u00a0But I can't help wondering whether\u00a0there will be some evolutionary impact to this brave new link-rich world, and if we, and our kids, will be the better for it.\u00a0\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://obama.wsj.com/topic/Steven_Johnson", "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123980920727621353.html", "http://hyperlexicon.blogspot.com/", "http://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/", "http://kristenspina.wordpress.com/", "http://www.squidalicious.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2009/04/theres-something-about-blog-writing-that-seems-so-akin-to-the-way-the-brain-works-i-started-writing-this-back-in-february-20.html", "title": "Free Association"},

Because the New Yorker has a terrific article by Tim Page about what it's like to have Asperger's, and because the new Vogue, at 840 pages, is a very glamorous lethal weapon.  And even though I'll never wear any of the clothes, it's nice to know someone can.\n6. Frozen yogurt.  It's so 80s.  Welcome back, my little friend. I missed you.\n7. Reading you, and writing this.

We were talking about the inexorable feeling that no matter what we do, we're never completely \"off the clock.\"  Every moment--a bath, a meal, a trip to the store--is a learning opportunity waiting to be fulfilled, and every moment we're not alert to the therapeutic possibilities feels wasted, and then we feel guilty and worried, and like bad parents, and you know what?

{"date": "June 05, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tFor a long time, I refused to buy any books with the dreaded \"A\" word in the title (that pesky magical thinking again).  Somehow the idea of having them in the house made our suspicions, and then the emerging reality, seem more intense.  But the ice had to melt, and eventually I broke down and bought Greenspan's The Child With Special Needs, and then The Out-Of-Sync Child, desperately trying to understand how our son was like the children described in those books.  But he wasn't, really, not in any clear-cut way, and the whole idea that he might be \"on the spectrum\" filled us with equal parts dread and confusion.  \n\nThat didn't stop me from sidling over to the children's section in the bookstore from time to time, then furtively paging through Quirky Kids and The Maverick Mind and countless others to see if any struck a chord.  But I'd always leave the store empty-handed and a little shaken.  Is this really us?  Am I missing something?  The first memoir I read was Paul Collins' Not Even Wrong (love him; reading Sixpence House now, which is about reading, not autism), and then Kamran Nazeer's Send in the Idiots, and then one day, in an effort to find a bit of serenity, Susan Senator's Making Peace with Autism.  Around that time, J. and I started to ease up on the whole is-he-or-isn't-he debate, and accept that a) if there is a spectrum, he's on it; b) this is, in J's words, \"current events, not prophecy\" and c) none of this changes who my son is: a smart, delightful, funny, loving boy.\n\nWhat were we resisting? That he was different from other children?  No, that was pretty clear.  That he has difficulties with speech, and motor planning, and sensory integration, and social situations? No, we got that. That we needed to give him as much therapy as we could reasonably fit into his life--and ours?  No, he had a full program of therapies by the time he was two and a half.  That we should limit our expectations?  That he might never be independent?  That he didn't have empathy? That we should just accept all the received wisdom about what a child with autism spectrum disorder can do and will become?  That our life as we knew it was over?  No. No. No. No. No. We didn't, and don't, accept any of that. He's given us no reason to; in fact, he's full of surprises.\n\nSo I was delighted to find a link to Ralph Savarese's LA Times editorial on Mom-NOS's blog a couple of weeks ago (thanks, Mom!), in which he espouses a joyful, optimistic and, I believe, respectful model for parenting a child with special needs.  I was even more delighted to read his book Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption this past week.  Let me say this upfront: it is not a book to pick up lightly.  It's about intense commitment: commitment to a child with autism whose biological parents were unable or unwilling to care for him, who had suffered extreme neglect and abuse, who did not speak, and who, with the aid of his adoptive parents' incredible love and persistence and ingenuity and patience, learns to communicate independently, reflect on his past, participate and excel in school and give us a glimpse--more than a glimpse--into what autism feels like from the inside.\n\nHeroic? Heartwarming? A triumph of the human spirit?  I would say yes, actually, but that's not at all what Savarese is after.  Like any thoughtful memoirist, he resists the narcissism inherent in the form, and it gnaws at him throughout the book.  He doesn't want to be praised or idealized.  He's not looking for the easy out.  He insists meticulously on detailing his own doubts, faults, frailties through the process of bonding with, adopting and raising his son DJ.  He doesn't shy from political, cultural, psychological, even literary analysis of autism and disability.  He wants us to see it all: the anguish, the confusion, the joys, the mistakes, the odd trajectories of progress and regression.\n\nMost stunning about this book is that, through the process of facilitated communication (in which he types his thoughts with some slight physical assistance from his parents), DJ becomes able to express himself and thus tell his own story.  Savarese includes many of DJ's thoughts, poems and school assignments throughout the book, up to and including the final chapter, which is DJ's work entirely (I did find myself wishing that his wife had had a chapter too).

{"date": "March 23, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tAn up-and-down day with the guys. We decided to take a walk around the city to check out a local street fair and Easter parade, but Isaac melted down a few blocks in when we informed him that he was not allowed to trample a neighbor's flowerbed so he could touch their heart.\n\nI'll explain: there's an art project called Hearts in San Francisco, started in 2004, in which a number of artists were commissioned to paint large metal heart sculptures for auction.  The proceeds went to San Francisco General Hospital.  On any given walk around the city, chances are that you'll see at least one heart: in a public space like Union Square, or, just as likely, peering out of someone's garden.\n\nIsaac is entranced by the hearts, so much so that he wants to touch each one he sees.  It's partly childish ritual, partly, I think, compulsion.  \n\nHere's where our problems began. The accelerant was low blood sugar, brought on by what I like to call \"sheer cussedness,\" brought on by a show of will that would put the WWF to shame (metal chairs not included). We ended up at a street corner, lamely trying to coax Isaac off his behind, while he cried and screamed and cursed the skies like a miniature King Lear.\n\nAfter a while, J. managed to convince Isaac that there would be no more bus if he didn't have lunch first [the bus being verrry popular around these parts], and, sure enough, a few bites of chicken and waffle fries later, my sunny son re-emerged.  Another shining example of QAP by the husband.  \n\nAfter lunch, we wandered down Chestnut Street in the Marina, where he stopped to touch yet another heart.  Luckily, this one was publicly accessible.  We're home now, all decompressing in our various ways.  Isaac is happily watching Diego (so age-appropriate!) and J. is checking email while I tap this out before starting the whole evening ritual:  dinner, bath, bedtime.\n\nWe're in such a \"more\" phase now: more language, more engagement, more willfulness and, with it, more moodiness, more compulsiveness, more extremes.  I really do think Isaac is in a period of unfolding, and my goal, as much as I have one, is to try not to overthink this.  Just let him be, let him be four, let him blow off steam and try and fail, and, to the extent possible and as safety and sanity permit, get the hell out of the way.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.heartsinsf.com", "http://www.paulabest.com/hearts-progress.html"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/03/thought-for-the.html", "title": "I Heart San Francisco"},
{"date": "March 19, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tThrough an odd little twist of fate, I ended up being invited to the Los Angeles premiere of Autism: The Musical this past weekend.  Since my sister lives there, I thought I'd make a weekend of it.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to expect when I arrived. It had been three years since the film was shot; would the kids be there? Would the parents? And how on earth does one hold a Hollywood premiere with a group of autistic children? It's the exact recipe for disaster: crowds, noise, lights, commotion, strangers, unpredictability.\n\nYet the kids rallied. They did what they do: some beamed, some looked down, some found a neutral spot in the distance to focus on as the cameras snapped and flashed. Some gave interviews.\n\nThe photographer from HBO, who graciously moved aside so I could get some shots of the kids on the red carpet, glanced over at me at one point and said, so softly I could barely hear him, \u201cThis is a good day.\u201d\n\n \n\nAfter the screening, the kids performed live. It was clear they were having a ball, overwhelming as it must have been to sing and dance in front of an audience that size.  Lexi and Wyatt sang, Neal danced, and Henry displayed his budding chops as a standup comic.  \n\nFinally, toward the end, Adam took the stage, his cello nearly dwarfing him, and began to play a few notes. \u201cMy pinky hurts,\u201d he cried, and stopped. There were calls for kisses, for band-aids, for more kisses. Finally, satisfied, he started again. \u201cOwww,\u201d he called out, \u201cMy pinky really hurts!\u201d So it was decided that he\u2019d forego the cello and sing his song instead. He performed a lovely rendition of \"Nature Boy,\" by Eden Ahbez:\n\nThe greatest thing\nYou\u2019ll ever learn\nIs to love\nAnd be loved in return.\n\nIt was a good day.\n\nFor more information, or to read my review on BabyCenter, click here.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.slide.com/pivot?cy=tp&at=un&id=288230376167928568&map=1", "http://www.slide.com/pivot?cy=tp&at=un&id=288230376167928568&map=2", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Boy_%28song%29", "http://blogs.parentcenter.babycenter.com/momformation", "http://blogs.parentcenter.babycenter.com/momformation/2008/03/18/hey-kids-lets-put-on-a-show/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/03/autism-the-musi.html", "title": "Autism: The Musical: The Premiere!"},
{"date": "April 02, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tOn a May evening in a Paris theater some years ago, a group of dancers and musicians took the stage and began their performance.  The effect was so unexpected\u2014even discordant\u2014that it provoked a riot among the audience.  People shouted.  Fights broke out in the aisles.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t Elvis.  It wasn\u2019t even the Sex Pistols.  It was Paris 1913, the first public performance of Igor Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Rite of Spring.\u201d \n\nHow is it possible that a simple piece of theater could evoke such outrage?   Over the years, sociologists, psychologists, historians and musicologists have proffered various theories about the suggestive nature of the dance, and the discordant tones of the score, but no one will ever know precisely what sent an otherwise civilized audience into total chaos.\n\nThat was nearly 100 years ago.  Scandalous as it was at the time, Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cRite\u201d ultimately taught a whole generation to hear differently.  And it is widely credited with making modern music possible.\n\nOn this Autism Awareness Day, I\u2019d like to honor Igor Stravinsky, because I believe his \u201cRite\u201d has a lot to teach us about where we are today with autism.  \n\nAutism is many things to many people, but it is essentially a difference of perception\u2014sometimes mild, sometimes severe, with many thousands of permutations.  And, like the audience in the theater that night, we are at a fundamental moment: will we cover our ears and flee, or will we try, in whatever way we can, to hear its music?\n\nBy asking those with autism to live as we do in our world, we\u2019re asking them to endure a daily cacophony that sends their senses into overload.  Is that even the right thing to do? Can we help them find a way through?  Can we look past their coping behaviors to understand what they are trying to communicate?  \n\nDaily, even hourly, we are chipping away at these questions.  And it's heavy work.\n\nThere are many, many people in the trenches today who are committed to listening to and reaching people with autism in whatever way they can: through music, art, drama, mathematics, language, pictures\u2014even textures, smells, taste, touch and movement.  Here are just a few:\n\nDr. Stanley Greenspan, for example, whose Floortime approach is so innately respectful of developmental, individual and learning styles; \n\nProfessor Simon Baron-Cohen, whose CHAT diagnostic tool is simplifying diagnosis for so many families, and who communicates such a sense of respect for the individuality of those with autism; \n\nElaine Hall of The Miracle Project in Los Angeles, who used dramatic play to reach her son Neal, and who is sharing what she\u2019s learned with other families, most visibly in the film \"Autism: The Musical.\" \n\nAnd sooner or later, we end up talking about causation, and the false dichotomy of acceptance versus cure, mind versus body and medical versus educational interventions.  And then voices get raised, and lines drawn, and it all goes to hell. \n\nPlease. We have to stop fighting each other.  Autism is complicated and personal.  We have to let our differences coexist.\n\nWe have to get past all of this.\n\nPeople with autism demand and deserve acceptance and openness, and, like those of us who are less than one standard deviation from the hypothetical norm, they need services and insurance and educational options to help them address any and all challenges they face in daily life.  \n\nFor adults who can advocate for themselves, it comes down to personal choice.  For those who can\u2019t, or for children who are too young to do so, we parents and loved ones must be there until they are able to do it for themselves.  And we have to do it with respect and with love and with utter fearlessness.\n\nHelping people does not imply a lack of respect.  Respect and acceptance doesn\u2019t diminish the challenges that many people with autism face.  Acknowledging the challenges our children has nothing to do with how much we love them.  Yes, autism can bring confusion and pain, but it also can bring us unexpected gifts.\n\nSo on this World Autism Awareness Day, I have a few words for those of you who are making your impact in whatever way:\n\nCNN: You showed true leadership today, on a complex and prickly issue, and I was incredibly moved to see the personal commitment behind your coverage.  Special thanks to Jim Boulden, John Dear, Soledad O\u2019Brien and your families for breaking the fourth wall and permitting yourselves to be part of this story.  Your perspective deepened the coverage immeasurably.\n\nInsurance companies: you can\u2019t hide from this issue.  It is not going away any time soon.  Pay now, or pay more\u2014a lot more\u2014later.  And quit \u201closing\u201d our freaking paperwork.   \n\nLorri Unumb: you\u2019re amazing.  Your work on Ryan\u2019s law is a critical step toward helping an entire generation of children get the insurance coverage they need.\n\nPoliticians: Show real leadership.  Pressure the insurance companies and fund education, research, promising therapies.  Do not, I repeat, do not, break your campaign promises on this issue.  A generation depends on you.\n\nResearchers:  Thank you for everything you\u2019re doing to get to the heart of autism and put all this divisiveness about causation to rest.\n\nTherapists, teachers and doctors: Thank you for everything you do for our children.   Please don\u2019t discount our concerns and give us a false and temporary sense of security.  Early intervention is key, so give us the referral if we\u2019re worried. And don\u2019t forget to look at the whole family\u2014not just the child.  Autism affects us all.\n\nParents: Don\u2019t ever lose hope.  Find your people\u2014we\u2019re here and we understand.  You can find us on blogs and Internet communities and in the therapist\u2019s offices and at the playground and in line at the checkout stand.  And remember\u2014this is a marathon\u2014not a sprint, so find some time, however you do it, to take care of yourselves.\n\nPeople with autism, our children and families and friends:  Even though we screw up a lot, we\u2019re trying, just like you are.  And even if we don\u2019t always understand you, we always, always, always love and respect you. \n\nIf you've read this far, well, thanks.  And if you have something you\u2019d like to say about autism today, please share it in the comments.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring", "http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/music/riteofspring.html", "http://www.floortime.org/", "http://autismresearchcentre.com/arc/staff_member.asp?id=33", "http://www.themiracleproject.org/home.html", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/", "http://www.susansenator.com", "http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2008/news/autism/", "http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/04/01/autism.insurance/index.html"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/04/today-is-world.html", "title": "World Autism Awareness Day: a Rite of Spring"},
{"date": "March 21, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t In the earliest days of Isaac's diagnosis, there would be a certain point at which the specialist would stop and say, in a tone meant to comfort us, \"but, you know, he's very high-functioning.\"\u00a0 \n\nAnd I'd glance at J., and he'd look off into the distance for a split-second, and in that moment a whole spectrum of feelings would flit across his face: relief, resignation, hope, fear, irritation.\u00a0 I knew what he was thinking: we'd won the diagnostic equivalent of a consolation prize.\n\nWhat does it mean?, we'd wonder aloud to each other.\u00a0 We knew what it was supposed to mean: Isaac had [emerging] language.\u00a0 He had [some] eye contact.\u00a0 He didn't have an awful lot of rigidity, sensory defensiveness or stereotypical behaviors, beyond occasional hand-flapping and a lifetime membership, when excited, in The Ministry of Silly Walks.\u00a0 In short, we were being told, we weren't that far off Normal.\n\n\"So,\" we'd wonder aloud, trying to narrow things down a bit, \"does that mean you think he'll be mainstreamed? have friends? live independently? be loved?\u00a0 What are we talking about here?\"\n\nBut they could never answer.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially as we draw closer to the Rubicon of Kindergarten and the One-Way Trip to Real School.\u00a0 Where children begin to develop far more sophisticated social barometers: who's In and who's Out. Who's Cool and who's Weird.\u00a0 And, beyond that, there is homework, and there are expectations, and there are more and more statistical norms, and tests, and expanses of unstructured time when he will have to eat and play and figure out social cues and fend for himself.\n\nAnd, yeah, I'm scared.\n\nRecently, a friend said to me that she thinks that the really high-functioning kids, the ones who are just slightly different, have the hardest time of it, because as they grow they are met with a constant barrage of expectations that they don't know how to navigate.\u00a0 I don't know that I agree with her, especially having seen so many children with autism who struggle simply to stay regulated from one moment to the next. It's got to be completely physically overwhelming and exhausting.\u00a0 \n\nBut what's more, I don't even buy into this high-function/low-function business anymore, especially now that I've read MOM-NOS's post on the topic, entitled \"The high cost of 'high function.'\"\u00a0 And now that I've read Amanda Baggs' blog:\n\n\"Remember that when they attack someone you are not, they are not attacking you. They are just attacking something they think is you, an illusion in their heads.\" \n\nAre those the words of someone with \"low function?\"\u00a0 Hell no.\u00a0 I am writing those words down now because I know that some day in the not-too-distant future, I will need them for Isaac.\u00a0 And for that, I thank Amanda, a thousand times over.\n\nWhen it comes to the whole \"normal\" thing, we've gotten a bit of a free pass up to this point.\u00a0 After all, a quirky four-year-old is cute.\u00a0 But an older child?\u00a0 An adult?\u00a0 That's an entirely different proposition.\u00a0 And so we are back to the eternal question of what is \"quirkiness\" (lovable eccentricity) versus \"disorder\" (off-putting).\u00a0 It's a value judgment, plain and simple.\n\nAs my beloved Drama Mama has said:\n\n\"Many times, when I am down or sad about Miss M's challenges, I realize that I am looking at her through my lens - what my experiences were, what made me happy - and it does not reconcile because she, blessedly, is her own person. We have to change the expectations and look at things from a new angle. And that, my friends, is her gift to me.\"\n\nDrama, thanks for that.\u00a0 And pass the glasses.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://likeashark.blogspot.com/2007/12/triggers.html", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/10/high-cost-of-high-function.html", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/", "http://likeashark.blogspot.com/2007/12/triggers.html"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/03/hes-so-function.html", "title": "He's so functional"},

The truth is, he's growing in so many areas: interpersonally, communicatively, intellectually.  He can sight-read simple words and sound out longer phonetic ones.  He's big on kissing lately, loves stories, and is a world-class ham: he knows when he's said something funny, to the extent that he repeats it until the last laugh is squeezed out of the room.  But the \"stereotypical\" behavior continues: we continue to see flapping, perseveration (around buses and elevators, most particularly), and a lot of anxiety about noises.\n\nBut oh the moods on that kid.  I see him starting to try out ways to cope: today, for example, my Dad was here and so we went to the Farmer's Market while J. took a much-deserved break.  Isaac was a bit edgy, wanting to ride the streetcar, so I tried out my new gambit.  \"Okay, pal,\" I said, \"Here's the plan. First we go to the Farmer's Market, then we get you some bread, then we buy some food, then we go home, and you can ride buses with Daddy.\"  \n\nHe considered it for a while, repeated it to himself a few times, and was fine.  Absolutely fine.  It seems that I got the better part of the deal today, since J. and later Beata weren't so lucky.

Isaac had been edgy all weekend, and since we didn't want to get kicked out of any more hotels, we thought we'd rely on our three most powerful tools in the global war on meltdown: protein, humor and exercise.  \n\nWe took a walk, during which Isaac chattered happily about anything and everything that caught his attention: buses (of course), people, dogs, porta-potties (all, thankfully, padlocked).  As the map on Dora the Explorer would say, \"Say it with me: Spontaneous.  Meaningful. Language.\"\n\nWe crossed into the Presidio and took the footpath, making our way over rocks, branches, and beds of pungent eucalyptus.  As we rounded the last curve, the Palace of Fine Arts came into view.  Suddenly, Isaac announced he wanted to go to the Exploratorium--a place with mixed memories for us.  \n\nFirst, imagine an environment that is completely devoted to engaging the senses.  Then mentally fill it with tourists.  Then go back to the sensory part.  Would it surprise you if I told you we had to carry Isaac out bodily the first time we went because he just could not stop stimming on a series of spinning disks?  Would it further surprise you that we have a family membership?  Yes, we are masochists.  But over time, as Isaac has matured, he's become able to sample more of what the museum has to offer, and to stay regulated (mostly) and have a good time.\n\nThat's not to say it's a perfect experience.  The transition from exhibit to exhibit can be tough.  He's not the suavest turn-taker.  The elevator is a highlight, for no other reason than that it's...an elevator.

It seemed sort of Greekly ironic, a bad cosmic joke.\n\nIt turns out we were very, very wrong.\n\nThe truth is, Isaac loves language.\u00a0 Loves communication.\u00a0 Loves rhymes and silly songs and word substitutions and the surprises that words make when the sneak up on you from behind.\u00a0 \n\nFrom his earliest days, he'd laugh when he heard a new word, and later, laugh and repeat it--endlessly.\u00a0 This last weekend, as we horsed around on the bedroom floor, I asked him jokingly, \"Isaac, do you want some proprioceptive input?\"\u00a0 \"Yes!\" he crowed, giggling madly.\u00a0 \"Popoceptive...input!\"\u00a0 \n\nTonight, as J. shepherded our tired boy home from a luxurious dinner of chicken and fries, Isaac insisted that Daddy pick him up.\u00a0 \"Isaac, you're very heavy.\u00a0 You're the biggest boy I've ever carried,\"\u00a0 J. said, scooping him up.\u00a0 \"You're not a small boy,\" Isaac answered, smiling.\u00a0 \"You're not a teeny-tiny boy.\u00a0 You're a double boy!\" \n\nDouble boy.\u00a0 Okay, forgetting the pronoun confusion for a second, consider this: from a child who is supposed to be unable to understand anything but the most literal language, that's a pretty clever image.\u00a0 \n\nSaid more plainly: thems are fightin' words.\n\nP.S. Today is believed to be the birthday of William Shakespeare, who is responsible for so many of the phrases--even words--we utter every day. \n\nOn behalf of my son, born a mere 439 years after you, Happy Birthday, Will. \n\n\u00a0\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jakessteaks.net/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/04/shakespeares-bi.html", "title": "Shakespeare's birthday, and other stories"},

Have you heard that before?\"\n\"Nope.  Have you?\"\n\"Nope.  It's great, isn't it?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nAnd isn't it bizarre to think so.\n\n*\nAfter a few false starts, we finally managed to get Isaac dressed, with the help of many fulsome promises that he would have at least one elevator ride before we went to the new school open house.  He was pretty reluctant, but a few rides and two cookies later, we were primed and ready for action.\n\nHe held J.'s hand as we walked from the car to the schoolyard (my heart tight in my chest, trying not to feel the weight of such a rite of passage, just to go with it, let it happen).  He sidled through the gate and made a beeline for a clutch of kids playing with bubbles. He stayed there for a time, crouched down, happily blowing bubbles with the other kids, then edged over to the food table, where he availed himself of a rather large doughnut before hitting the climbing structure.  \n\nMy friends, it was awesome.  \n\nJ. and I introduced ourselves to some of the parents, the principal and a couple of the kindergarten teachers, one of whom was kind enough to give Isaac and us a guided tour of the classrooms.  He wandered into each in turn, curiously examining the art materials, toys and books.  \n\n\"Today's not a play day, sweetie, just a looking day.  So no touching the toys.\"\n\nHe was fine with it.  \n\nOne of the classrooms had a centrally-located \"word wall\" where they had organized a number of simple three-to five-letter words, arranged by letter of the alphabet.  Isaac wandered over and traced his fingers along the words, spelling several of them aloud as he went.\n\n\"P-L-A-Y.\"  Play!\"\n\nI admit, I don't want to be one of those parents who ostentatiously parades her child's accomplishments to anyone who will listen (yes I realize I am a hypocrite--here I am blogging about it after all) but...I was so damned proud of him.  For spelling, sure, but mostly for working through his anxiety.  For getting into the action with the other kids.  For giving the whole thing a try. \n\nHe had a really good time.  When we left, he said goodbye to the teacher who had given us the tour, and waved bye-bye to the school.  \n\nI burst into tears in the car on the way back.\n\nI'm not a superstitious person, usually, and I know we're in for a big heap of change in the next few months, but I'm going to take this as a good sign.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/04/okay-so-maybe-i.html", "title": "Okay so maybe I overdramatized a little..."},

There's something about museums that calms us both and shakes loose a bit of perspective.  \n\nSeveral weeks ago, we took a walk among the cool granite walls of the grandly named California Palace of the Legion of Honor, and had a chance to see a fragment of the Dead Sea Scrolls on loan from Israel.  It sat, just a tiny fragment, in a dim recess, illuminated by the slightest hint of light.  It was magical, and a little spooky, to see something so ancient and yet so unprepossessing, and know that it was written nearly 2,000 years ago.  I kept thinking that, as Bogie so memorably said in Casablanca, \"the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.\"  \n\nI snuck away briefly today to go to an open studio on my own and visit a painter I admire (more on that in a future post).

Procrastinating.  Why, you ask?  Well, we're in another phase, and I'm not sure what any of it means. \n\nIt all started when Isaac fell in love with the computer, discovered YouTube and the cult of the elevator.  You see, there is quite an active population of Web users who just. Love. Elevators.  They film themselves going in, pressing the buttons, coming out.  Malls, hospitals, office buildings--it's all fair game.  And each little film begins the same way: \"Okay, let's get on the elevator.\"  And off we go.\n\nIf you read the comments, it's fairly clear that many are on the spectrum (special interest, anyone?).  And Isaac is just rapt.  And it's becoming harder and harder to get him away from it.  I hate to force the issue, because I want him to find his own limits, and sometimes he does.  And I want him to have an outlet, because the poor guy is really tightly scheduled, between two schools, ABA, outside OT and PT and playgroup.  It's a lot.  Maybe too much.\n\nSo we're in a bit of a slump over here, still a little sick and, I admit, a bit obsessive.  On the other hand, there are a few amazing little nuggets of progress lately.  In addition to making up his own \"Arabic\" numbers, Isaac is now commenting much more frequently about things.  This morning, he informed me that he wanted to go to school and be happy, which I allowed was an excellent plan.  He loves \"I Spy,\" and sometimes we like to look out his bedroom window and watch the people and cars just pass by--quite restful, actually. Tonight, as we snuggled before bed, he kissed my forehead, then my cheek, then my eyes before snuggling down under the covers. He's also decided he likes Dora the Explorer, and we're almost certain that he picked it up at school.  \"Dora, Dora, Dora--she's the espora,\" he informed me the other day.  \"You mean 'explorer,' I amswered.  \"Espora,\" he repeated, grinning.  \n\nBut the elevators--I'm not sure how to take that.  Maybe, as I hopefully rationalize to J., he's in a developmental leap, and the perseveration and sleeplessness are a sympton (I almost typed \"side order.\"  Fries with that, anyone?)  Or maybe we're starting to enter \"special interest land.\"  \n\nIt's enough to give a girl the bends. \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://blogs.parentcenter.babycenter.com/momformation/2008/02/12/woo-hoo-my-kid-is-learning-bad-habits/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/02/i-know-i-know-i.html", "title": "I know, I know, I'm a bum, which is what I am"},
{"date": "February 15, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tThree hundred and seventy-one days ago, on a Friday night very much like this one, I lay next to Isaac in his narrow bed, willing him to fall asleep.  My heart was racing, I felt trembly and panicked.  This isn't sustainable, I thought. How do people do it?  He shifted his weight, rolled over onto his stomach and popped his thumb into his mouth.  There's just so much, I thought.  So much to do.  I can't keep track.   And I didn't have anyone to talk to...who'd been there.  Who could tell me that their kid was also fixated on doors, or melted down at people's houses.  Who had clever comebacks for the nosy strangers with helpful parenting tips.  Who got it.\n\nSure, we had a lot of flyers.  The Hanen method. ABA exercises.  Excel spreadsheets to track learning opportunities and challenges and emerging skills.  Evaluations, insurance forms, notes from school.  Scribbled Post-It notes with therapists' names on them (therapists, usually, with no open spots).  \"No drooling was observed,\" reported one speech evaluation. \"Teacher's self-report indicates moderate to severe autism,\" another read. \"You should probably think about a special needs trust,\" a therapist (long since gone) had helpfully suggested.\n\nThe Web was a minefield.  I'd Google \"autism\" and hundreds of sites came up, clinical, therapeutic, dry, political, well-meaning, narrowly helpful and some, I thought, legitimately nuts.  I'd Google PDD-NOS, and the descriptions were so terse as to be completely useless. \"Actual mileage may vary,\" they may as well have said.  But nothing I found could tell me what it was like from the parent's perspective.\n\nThen there were the books: The Out-of-Sync Child (How is this like Isaac? I thought.  I don't see him.  This isn't helping.)  Susan Senator's Making Peace with Autism (oh God how are we gonna, but she's getting through.  Maybe it'll be okay.  She seems okay.)  Stanley Greenspan's The Child with Special Needs (OhGodohGodohGod eight twenty-minute sessions per day?!?  How can we possibly...and where's the part that tell me how it all turns out?)\n\n[Flash forward to tonight: feet pounding down the hallway.  He's having trouble sleeping. Some things haven't changed all that much.]\n\nI lay in that bed that night 371 days ago until Isaac finally fell asleep.  And I thought about what I was going to do.  We were past the initial crisis and into a new phase, and the knockdown dragout of that first 18 months post-diagnosis was wearing us to a nub. I'd thought about writing about all of this, but what?  Did the world really need another blog?  But then I thought about those spreadsheets, those hard-won realizations, those Post-It notes, those scribbled phone numbers.  I thought about the way we felt--hollowed out--when we left the developmental pediatrician's office for the second time and learned that what we thought of as a blip was turning out to be our future.  \n\nI woke up the next morning and talked to J.  And I just started writing.  That was a year ago this week.  I've learned so much, met (most virtually) so many amazing people.  You're living it.  You know what to say to help me feel better when I'm down, and you understand how much it means when, out of the blue, Isaac says, \"yeah.\"   And I've been stunned and grateful to hear from so many other parents who are living this life and who, like me, have spent many restless nights trying to figure it all out.\n\nOne day when Isaac is a little older, I'll have to pull back the curtain on some of the more intimate aspects of of our lives.  But there's a ways to go and a lot to talk about before that happens.\n\nThanks for being part of this community we've created.  Thanks for sharing your stories.

Granted, there was a little too much focus on his new sport, opening up people's mail slots, but we managed to negotiate him down after a while.  Finally we wandered into a burrito place and ate lunch, then into Cliff's, a general store in the Castro, where he picked out a new toy car (a green BMW wagon).  Personally, I would have gone for one of the roadsters, but he was firm in his choice.  I gave him money to pay for it and he answered when the cashier asked him what kind of car he had (a green one,\" he whispered).  \n\nWe all walked out together to the bus stop, where Isaac proceeded to pick off the price tag.  It was one of those tiny moments that brings tears to my eyes: Isaac struggling a little with the paper tag, then J.  asking if he needed help, and showing him how to get his fingernail underneath the sticky paper, their foreheads nearly touching.

Would everything be all right?  \n\nBut we are getting--getting, mind you--to a place of acceptance.  What I hoped we would achieve when I bought Susan Senator's book over a year ago.  (Hi Susan. I linked to you again because I wanted you to know that your book was the first one that gave me any hope, and it occurred to me that last night's post was kind of a flashback--like reading the first twenty pages of your book, not knowing how it all turns out.  Although still, we're at the very beginning.)  \n\nSo, since I gave this post such a portentous title, I now feel obligated to deliver the goods.  Where are we?  Oh wow.  So many new places.  Here's a flavor: Beata, Isaac's nanny, texted me this intriguing anecdote a little earlier this evening:\n\n[Scene: Safeway.  Beata and Isaac are picking up a few groceries.] \nBeata: Isaac, do you want something to eat?\nIsaac: How about some pizza and wine?\n\nDon't call Child Protective Services on me.  I swear I don't know where it came from (the wine part, anyway.  He's a fiend for pizza).  And that--spontaneity, deviation from the rote, knowing he's funny and milking it for all it's worth? That makes me very, very happy.\n\nSomething's shifted.  Part of it is language, yes.  But there's more confidence too.  And more openness to being with people.  I can see he wants it, but it also tires him, and he needs to regroup.

This is especially gratifying since Michael is a journalist and, like Kristina's Autism Vox, his blog is rich with news and a range of resources for all of us following topic \"A.\"  \n\nHe's just posted a series of informative articles aimed at parents of newly-diagnosed kids; I'll be digging into these in more depth later this week.  It's also exciting to be in such impressive company along with Kristina, Susan Senator and Maddy (Whitterer on Autism), who I read regularly, and Judith Ursutti (Autismville) and Lisa Jo Rudy from About.com\u2019s Autism blog, who I'll be checking out now.

And with every meme must come a meme-ee.  So I'd like to pass this on to my good friend Daisy Mae Fatty Pants, also known as Emily, for the following reasons:\n\n1. Long before our blogs were a glimmer in our eyes, Emily was actually one of the first autism parents I met.  I don't think I'd be giving too much away to say that, for a while, our sons had OT appointments at the same time.  In those early days, Emily was unfailingly generous and helpful to this terrified, overwhelmed mom as we sat in the waiting room during our sons' sessions.  Then she moved away, unfortunately for me, and we fell out of touch until she commented on my blog one day. Then she started writing.\n\n2. Emily's blog, A Life Less Ordinary, is unusual, even unique, in that she is a biologist and is therefore able to offer analysis on new studies and explain them in a way that makes sense to mere mortals like me.  That's been exceptionally useful as these new reports on possible genetic factors are released; it's a kind of context that's hard to find, and well worth the time.\n\n3. She's very, very funny.  Bone-dry sense of humor, which I love. \n\n4. This is an excellent opportunity to ask her where she got that name.  And how Mr. DMFP feels about his moniker.  Fess up, Emily.\n\nWow.

J. and I looked at each other, a little rattled.\u00a0 \"I don't think that sounded much like Arabic,\" I whispered.\"\u00a0 J. went to the computer and checked.\u00a0 \"Uh, no, not so much.\"\n\nSo it seems our little linguist is making up numbers.\u00a0 But before he invents an entirely new alternate Arabic, we're going to have to find someone who can set him straight.\u00a0 And then we're going to have to find a name for Isaac's new language.  I vote for \"Speeda.\"\n\n***\n\"I want a snack,\" Isaac demands as soon as I've finished brushing his teeth.  He's doing this a lot lately--getting \"hungry\" as soon as the pajamas are on and the teeth are brushed.   So I give in, got a bowl of cereal and milk for him, and a dish of ice-cream for myself, and we sit together at the dining-room table. \"I want to play letters,\" he says.\n\nPlaying letters is fairly new.  It consists of one of us asking him to tell us the first letter of any word we can think of.  He can usually guess correctly, thrown off only by diphthongs and certain vowels.  \n\nHe nails them all: cereal, helicopter, ear, nose, elbow, eye, tummy, milk, train, bread, peanut butter, school.  On and on.  Circus trips him up.  \"Circus starts with 'S', he tells me.  \n\n\"Nope,\" I reply.  \"Try again.\"  He thinks for a moment.  \"Circus starts with 'C'!!\"  Spooky.\n\nHe plows through the cereal, plows through the words.  He's hungry for all of it.  I brush his teeth again and he snuggles into bed.  \"A few more words,\" he pleads, and we do another dozen or so.  He's vibrating with the excitement of knowing, of getting it right.  Finally, I call an end to it and rub his back, singing softly.  He curls into the pillow and drifts off to sleep.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/02/counting-in-ara.html", "title": "Numbers and Letters"},

Okay, to be honest, Lunar New Year began on February 7, but tonight is the San Francisco parade, soggy and wet as it will likely be.  We took Isaac to the Farmer's Market earlier today, and as we got out of the car we saw floats coming down the Embarcadero from all parts of Northern California: giant, colorful Buddhas, papier-mache firecrackers, flowers--all gaily decorated in reds, pinks and yellows.  \n\nIsaac was transfixed as the floats drove by, and stayed rooted to the spot long after the last one drive out of sight.  It took a few moments to redirect him, and then he generally bopped happily along as we picked up provisions for the storms that have been battering San Francisco.  On the way back, we passed a line of about 40 grade-school kids in colorful rain ponchos and top hats, bravely making their way up the hill toward Chinatown.  \n\n  \n\nWhen we got home, we took a big piece of cardboard and foam board from a framing project and turned it into an impromptu house.  A throw blanket completed the roof and made a \"screen door,\" and I threw a pillow in for \"furniture.\"  We made rain sounds, thunder, lightning, and snuggled inside until the \"rain\" stopped.  I brought in a plate of pear pieces, which he ravenously ate, our heads close together.  He was so happy, so relaxed, so in love with the beginnings of imaginative play.  He's starting to get it.  And this little game?  No expensive equipment--just a few random bits from around the house, and some packing tape, which we took turns sticking to each other and peeling off, to much hilarity.  \n\nOne of the best things about Lunar New Year, in my opinion: if your first New Year doesn't start off the way you'd hoped, it gives you a second chance.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.slide.com/pivot?cy=tp&at=un&id=1441151880763647762&map=1", "http://www.slide.com/pivot?cy=tp&at=un&id=1441151880763647762&map=2", "http://www.slide.com/pivot?cy=tp&at=un&id=1441151880763647762&map=E"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/02/gung-hay-fat-ch.html", "title": "Gung Hay Fat Choy"},

{"date": "February 28, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\nEarlier this week, NPR broadcast a story by Alix Spiegel on the relationship between imaginative play and self-regulation in children. The theory, based on work by Howard Chudacoff, a cultural historian at Brown University, holds that the nature of play has changed dramatically in the last century, from imaginative, fluid and active to more narrow, rule-based and focused on toys. \"It's interesting to me that when we talk about play today, the first thing that comes to mind are toys,\" says Chudacoff. \"Whereas when I would think of play in the 19th century, I would think of activity rather than an object.\" \n\nChudacoff points out a number of other factors that have dramatically altered the nature of play in the last century: the growing concern for safety, and an increasing thirst for achievement among the middle class.\u00a0 He argues that this decrease in imaginative, unstructured play correlates to a reduction in children's ability to self-regulate, which is critical to emotional development and, yes, success.\u00a0 \n\nThose of us who have children with special needs or learning differences have often been sensitized to the importance of play.\u00a0 In fact, \"Delays or abnormal functioning in...symbolic and imaginative play\" is one of the diagnostic criteria for autism, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), a tome with which I am all too familiar.\n\nAnd it makes sense.\u00a0 In play, we rehearse life: relationships, conflicts, dreams, beliefs; we learn impulse control and to be resourceful with a stick, a cardboard box and a few pebbles.\u00a0 And we all know that the time available to our children for pure, unstructured play continues to decrease, filled instead with lacrosse, and piano, and language lessons, and school, and enrichment of all sorts.\n\nI can't possibly do justice to the entire article here; for that you really need to read the article or, better, listen to the story.\u00a0 But it makes me wonder what else, in our high-achieving and hyper-scheduled world, we may be unconsciously giving up for our children--and if it's possible to get it back.\n\nFinally, I would be remiss by omitting the story behind the Thunder Burp, a toy gun which, according to Spiegel, was the first toy ever to be advertised on TV outside of the Christmas season.\u00a0 The Thunder Burp may be long forgotten, but its, um, echo remains even today.\n\nThe above is cross-posted on Silicon Valley Moms Blog.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=19212514", "http://research.brown.edu/research/profile.php?id=10078", "http://ani.autistics.org/dsm4-autism.html", "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=19212514", "http://turnerclassic.moviesunlimited.com/product.asp?sku=D64122", "http://www.svmomvs.com"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/02/blame-it-on-the.html", "title": "Blame it on the Thunder Burp"},

(One day in eighth grade, as I was walking down the hallway chatting with a friend, a certain jerk actually managed to bump into me from behind, and before I realized what was happening, undid my bra through my sweater. I didn't even realize it until I felt the telltale creep of the fabric and saw him, a step or two away in a cluster of similarly cretinous boys, doubled up in laughter, pointing.  I shudder to think how many hours he must have spent perfecting that technique.)\n\nThis is on my mind lately, as I notice Isaac's more frequent and sophisticated bids for attention, which seem to contradict item (1)(A)3 in the DSM IV, for me the most painful part of the diagnosis:\n\n\"A lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people, (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest to other people)\"\n\nTo me, (1)(A)3 gets at the heart of what we want when we make the choice to have a family: the desire to share joys, pains, experiences and points of view with the people we love.  \n\nThis morning, Isaac woke me up by abruptly yanking the covers off the bed.  Needless to say, I was not at my best, and grumbled to him that I wanted the covers and wanted to sleep.  But he wasn't buying it.\n\n\"I want Mommy to get out of bed,\" he insisted.\n\"Sweetie, I want to sleep. What do you need?\"\n\"I want Mommy to sit on the ground and play cars.\"\n\nInstantly, I was wide awake.  You want me to play cars?  With you?  Now?  He came around the bed and grabbed my hand. \"I want Mommy to get up.\"  \n\nI would call that a \"spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment,\" wouldn't you?\n\nAs it turned out, we played cars for about a minute, after which he decided he was hungry, so I made french toast for him, and strong coffee for myself, and we pottered happily as the sun crept out from behind the morning clouds. \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://ani.autistics.org/dsm4-autism.html"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/03/sisters-do-you.html", "title": "Boys will be boys"},

I was a model patient: I passed all the the tests.  \n\nAround that time, a friend of mine got pregnant. \n\n\"When's your amnio?\" I asked her casually one day as we were shopping for baby gear.  \n\"I'm not doing one.\"\nI was stunned.  \"You're not doing an amnio?  But...don't you have to?\"\n\"Nope.\"\n\"But...\" I didn't know how to phrase this.  \"What if, you know, something...?\"\n\"Susan,\" she said.  \"I'm having this baby, whatever and whoever it is. So screening is moot.\"\n\nAt the time, I remember thinking what strength of character it took to know to such a certainty that you would love your baby, no matter what complications fate might throw your way.  Of course, she knew what she was talking about--this was her second child.  For me, it was all still purely hypothetical.\n\n***\nI was worried about autism early on.  Fixated might be a better word, actually.  But I'm an anxious person, which paradoxically reassured me that my neurotic concerns were really nothing to worry about.  (If that last sentence made any sense at all to you, congratulations! You're as neurotic as I am).  I worried about Isaac's startle reflex, which seemed so delicate.  About the fact that sometimes he would shake his head from side to side when he was having trouble latching on.  I worried that he couldn't seem to get the hang of a pacifier (but ultimately found his thumb, which thankfully never got lost).  \n\nI remember asking the pediatrician about the head-shaking.  \"It just means he's disorganized,\" he said.  \"He'll get there.\"  In retrospect, I think it was a sign.  And the pacifier?  Oral motor--a big issue for Isaac.  So yes, I think there were some early indicators.\n\n***\nWhich leads me to my next question: in the multitude of tiny, transitory and sometimes bizarre things that young children do, which are meaningful, which are temporary, and, most importantly, what, if anything, should we do about them?\n\nI've posted a lot recently about Isaac's latest developments.  He's been so great, engaged, talking more, all that stuff.  Sometimes I feel so confident that he's opening up, unfolding almost, that it takes my breath away. But, truth be told, I also see more rigidity and more perseveration.  He needs to make sure doors are closed.  If you're in a room together and turn a light off, he wants it back on.  Immediately. I don't think he cares about the light particularly; it's just the altered state that bothers him.  \n\nThen there's his obsession with elevators (you would not believe the number of people who film themselves riding elevators and post them on YouTube.  Or maybe you would, because you're reading this. It's a whole subgenre.)  It feels like a fixation, a compulsion.  Is it a sort of Aspergian special interest?  I really don't know.  But the intensity and repetitiveness of it concerns me.\n\nAnd then I remember: he's four and a half. There is a lot to be worked out yet.  But I wonder if in three or five years I'll look back and see the outline of something that is just now beginning, and whether it'll be familiar, and whether it'll be allright.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/01/my-first-visit.html", "title": "Altered States"},
{"date": "January 16, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t The good news: Isaac is over the croup, and is feeling cool and perkier.  The bad news: daddy and I are now pretty sick ourselves with fever, chills and, for me, the added bonus of bronchitis.  Yuck.  We've been trying to avoid it by teaching him to cough into the crook of his arm, rather than, for example, our faces, but he always forgets.  Then, when I say \"Isaac, what do we do when we cough?\" he crooks his arm, fake-coughs into it, and shoots me a sly smile.\n\n***\nLike Nik, it's clear that Isaac is moving through a new developmental phase.  His sense of humor, always a strength, is blossoming, and his language is becoming a bit more sophisticated: new words, new phrases.  Yesterday, when I was getting ready to leave the house (the creeping crud not having fully descended), Isaac responded so naturally to my goodbye: \"Bye Bye, Mommy!\"  \n\nI went outside to catch my ride, and my phone rang.  It was Beata.  She wanted me to know that Isaac was sitting in the bay window, waving to me, and he wanted me to look up and wave back.\n\n***\nToday, when I picked him up from school, one of the teachers told me that Isaac had had a great time today at their celebration for Martin Luther King.  Apparently the kids did a march around the school.  One of the little girls didn't want to hold her sign, so Isaac carried it proudly. \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/01/the-good-news-i.html", "title": "Can't think of a title.

And well, when you're sleeping a lot, there's not a lot to report, unless you'd like an account of my dreams, which, trust me.\n\nIsaac's been a bit edgy, understandably, since both Mommy and Daddy cough a lot, look kinda gray, and take long naps.  I'm sure he'd prefer to trade us in for the models who actually get out of bed for more than two hours at a time.  Last night, as I was coughing myself to sleep, he rolled over, looked me in the eye, and said, \"No more coughs!\"  If only.\n\nI awoke from nap #2 this afternoon to hear him having a grand old time down the hall during his ABA session.  He was laughing, squealing, shouting for more.  When, during his bath, I asked him what they had done, he murmured, \"no,\" which is his way of telling me that he doesn't want to tell me.  Then he giggled, and said \"play in the tent!\"  And, a second later, \"the tent fall down!\" before collapsing in a further gale of giggles. \n\nGuess you had to be there.  But even if you weren't, you now know two things: there was a tent, and it fell down.  \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/01/i-havent-writte.html", "title": "Dispatches from nap central"},
{"date": "January 27, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tWe are on our way back from sickie-central. Isaac is fine, funny and still in love with elevators. J. is feeling better, but sounds like a cigar-smoking Borscht Belt comic, circa 1955. You half expect him to say things like \"Go away, kid--ya bother me,\" his voice is so low and growly. And me, well I am better. Still coughing, but able to breathe, which is a big improvement. In celebration, I went out and bought myself a bright green V-neck sweater (to bring out my eyes, thank you very much, and to break up the sea of black and gray in the closet. Not to mention the black and gray outside, since we are still waterlogged over here. It was my vote for Spring, for renewal and for color in general. So bring it on).\n\nLazy weekend. We hung around, moseyed, snuggled quite a bit. The comedic high point came yesterday when Isaac decided it would be fun to switch the first letter of every word with the letter \"H.\" So without skipping a beat he told us he wanted to \"Het in the har and ho to the harmer's harket.\" To do that, we had to \"ho down the heps to the harage.\" Luckily, he didn't bat an eye when I told him he needed to hait for the hoor to hopen. I think the kid has a future as a cryptographer.\n\nBeata came today so J. and I could see Persepolis, which is absolutely gorgeous and amazing and so moving. The only downside is that Isaac has been on a bit of a sleep strike, preferring instead to lie in bed singing to himself or to pad down the hall to demand even more food and see what we're doing (the appetite is back, bigtime). It's sweet, adorable and yes, a little bit maddening. \"Row, row, row your boat/gently down the stweam,\" comes the high warble from the bedroom. \"Melly, melly, melly melly, life dis but a dweam.\" \n\nBathtime is one of my favorite times lately. He's funny and relaxed and just so silly. Lately he's given to teasing me by threatening to drink his bathwater (or eat the bubbles). When I remind him that it'll make his tummy hurt, he grins impishly and says, \"be very sad,\" before slowly lowering his face to the bubbles, grinning like a little devil. Maddening in any other child, but such a good sign for him. If there's a limit, he'll press the button. And smile. And wait for you to react. And press it again.\n\nOn days like this, I wonder: what is this thing called autism? What is it really? A disorder of communication, or of speech? A disorder or a different order? We are lucky, so lucky. He is a happy, loving, bright boy. We adore each other. Days like this, I think, I really do, that we're going to be okay.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/persepolis/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/01/we-are-on-our-w.html", "title": "Everything's gonna be allright"},

And it's not me, snoring away next to a wide-awake four-year-old, as it's been the past two nights.  Gotta tell you, not good for the household harmony, that one.  But we're on an upswing around here; got some super-cute photos of you-know-who from school.  One shows him carrying a sign for the Martin Luther King Day march, which seemed to involve a tangle of four-year-olds on the sidewalk outside the school.  The other was of Isaac and two school-friends playing Cariboo, which I have to say is THE BEST GAME EVER.  \n\nAnd reports from school are encouraging.  A couple of tidbits: \"Isaac's use of language has increased and often blows me away. He's been adding comments into conversations at the lunch and afternoon snack table\" and my personal favorite: \"Isaac has been interacting with his peers more often.\" \n\nHe's also still on the word-play kick.  Tonight, he wanted to \"ho to heep with Haddy\"--a good thing since Hommy tends to pass out like a drunken sailor as soon as she lies down...probably the dregs of the bronchitis, or that bottle of rum I drank in the brig although J. attributes it to too much late-night blogging. \n\nSpeaking of which, (sailors and rum, not blogging) I was treated last night to a recitation of a very good portion of a Thomas episode.  By Isaac.  In his inimitable style.  Seems that auditory memory is in fine working order.  \n\nAnd what, really, does he get from Thomas?  For those of you with little Thomas groupies, do you ever wonder?  A recent favorite around here features Salty, whose sole purpose in life is to say things like \"Har, matey!\" and tell long, boring stories that make the other engines fall asleep.  I do wonder what Isaac is internalizing from this show: will my 21st-century boy grow up with solid, 19th-century values?  Will he aspire to be a Very Useful Engine?  I'm rambling, clearly, but you gotta wonder if all these little Thomas fanboys will grow up, move to England and become train conductors.  Or country vicars. \n\nOkay, enough for one night.

I rubbed his back, I sang songs, I brought a yummy toaster waffle and glass of milk, I sang more funny songs made up on the spur of the moment, mangled with the Beatles' \"Good Day Sunshine\" (at which point Isaac briefly raised his head, eyelids at half-mast, and muttered \"No.\")\n\nFinally, he opened his eyes, and after a while I managed to convince him to let me put on his pants (but, because we are working on compromises, I let him wear the shirt he had slept in to school).  Ran a washcloth over his face (we're getting a little silly now, he's in the game), got socks on, shoes on, held his hand down the stairs until.....\"Nooooooooooooo schoooooooooooool!!!\"\n\nWails.

Got to the front door, at which point another flood of tears, wailing, etc.  A kind mommy tried to get in the game, showing him how cool it was inside.  \"Nooooooooooooo,\" he wailed.  She gave me an empathetic, resigned look and finally went in.\n\nWe sat outside for about 20 minutes, rubbing our hands on the wall and then wiping them all over our faces (okay, just he did, but I was there in spirit).  He cried, I teared up.  He told me he wanted to go home and snuggle together.  I saw his point.  Really, I did.  And finally, he gave up and went in with me, sat down on the couch with one of his teachers for a few minutes, collected himself, and gave me a hug goodbye.

At first we convinced ourselves that he just wasn't interested in toys, preferring instead to observe the world and take it in at his own speed.  But the idea of taking a block and pretending it was a phone, or \"feeding\" a doll?  Couldn't care less.  Fast forward through a series of evaluations, and play continues to be his biggest challenge.  He's not really a literal child, in fact, he loves word play so much that we wonder if he'll turn out to be a poet, or a comic, or just, like his parents, a chronic wise-ass.  \n\nLately we are making some headway.  J., in a burst of Floortimey inspiration, has turned Isaac's love of elevators into a nice little pretend game.  He will hold up his hand so Isaac can press the imaginary \"button,\" then wait for the \"elevator\" to come and BING!  He moves his hands up and up and asks:\n\nJ: Isaac, what floor should we go to?\"\nIsaac: One hundred!\" [Ambitious child].\nJ: [Making whirring sound] BING! 100th floor!  Home of...\nIsaac: Rooms, frogs, San Franciscos, doors and Ps.\nJ: Wow!  That's a great store!  You can buy so many things!\n\nBut in a flash he's on to something else, looking out the window or opening a book.  Game over.  \n\nMost everyone who knows Isaac thinks the problem is less one of imagination than of motor planning.  But lately I wonder if it isn't a bit of chicken and egg.  Doesn't the one reinforce the other?  So we started something new: story time.

{"date": "September 24, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\nBy Jordan Sadler, SLP\n\n\nLast week, a post at the blog From Here to There and Back prompted me to suggest that the blog's author create a visual map of a challenging situation her son experienced at school.\u00a0 The subsequent off line conversation about this with the writer - and comments from her readers showing great interest in the topic - led me to think that perhaps this is a topic worthy of further explanation.\n\nThere are many ways to use visual strategies to map out a social situation for children.\u00a0 What I do in my work is ultimately a combination of ideas I have picked up over the years at numerous workshops given by Michelle Garcia Winner, SLP, who runs The Center for Social Thinking and Carol Gray of The Gray Center for Social Learning and Understanding.\u00a0 I give both of these amazing women full credit for the way I approach the teaching of social understanding and social thinking to children.\u00a0 Their work fills gaping holes in what is considered best practice for kids with social-pragmatic difficulties right now.\n\nThe ideas proposed by Ms. Gray and Ms. Winner make perfect sense once you've heard them explained, but are not, apparently, intuitive to many therapists because so rarely are children (or adolescents or adults) taught this way.\u00a0 In effect, we - therapists, teachers, and parents - are encouraged to approach social-pragmatic awareness not as a series of skills to be trained (as has been done in social skills groups and traditional ABA-type therapy), but as a process in which we help people to understand why we communicate the way we do. We want children to understand what kind of impact their behavior and language has on others.\u00a0 We don't say, \"Look at my eyes!\" to teach eye contact but rather explain, \"People's eyes are a window into what they are thinking about - if Ben is looking at the clock, he might be wondering if it's time to go home.\"\u00a0 \u00a0Non-verbal communication is explained in such a way that it carries meaning and becomes motivating to our clients.\u00a0 Of course, there is so much more to this, and I highly encourage those interested to seek out books and workshops with the experts in this field.\n\nI am going to provide an example of a behavior map, and in order to maintain confidentiality for my clients, I will use an experience from my own family.\u00a0 \n\nWhen my neurotypical older son was about 4 years old, we were at a neighbor boy's home.\u00a0 Now the neighbor boy's parents were both early childhood educators, and there was no place in the world as fun as their house.\u00a0 They had a big climbing structure right in their living room!\u00a0 It is no surprise that my son didn't want to leave.\u00a0 Ever.\u00a0 On one occasion, after ample warnings (the \"5-minute countdown\", I call it) it was time to depart.\u00a0 My son refused and became quite belligerent.\u00a0 After trying every strategy we well-trained adults could think of, I ended up carrying him home as he kicked and screamed; I was hugely pregnant, exhausted, and incredibly frustrated.\u00a0 I know we've all been there in one way or another.\n\nWhen we got home, I was at my wit's end.\u00a0 We were infuriated with each other.\u00a0 I did all I knew how to do in that situation, which was to sit silently on the floor and pull out paper and a marker.\u00a0 I quietly started to draw.\u00a0 Now, let's get something straight: I am no artist.\u00a0 That is not a requirement for this!\u00a0 In this situation, I sketched out the scene like a cartoon, and my son immediately sat down to watch.\u00a0 It started with two boys playing happily.\u00a0 Always show emotion on the faces throughout a social map!\u00a0 In the next frame, there was a smiling mother giving a 5-minute warning and the boys were still smiling.\u00a0 As we got down to the 1-minute warning, I showed the expression on my son's face start to shift into anger.\u00a0 \n\nWhen the stick-figure mother announced in her little \"speech bubble\" that it was time to go, I drew a boy with the angriest face I could muster and limbs out of control.\u00a0 But I think what was critical here was that I also drew the neighbor boy and his parents - all with concerned, sad faces - and myself looking angry.\u00a0 In the midst of a tantrum, our kids are not generally aware of how their behavior is affecting anyone else.\u00a0 If you can represent visually to a child the ways in which his actions affect how others think and feel, you are giving him the key to social thinking, or theory of mind. \u00a0 I pointed out to my son that he did not say \"thank you\", nor did he say \"good night\" to our hosts and that when we left they were all feeling sad.\u00a0 He was really impacted by this.\u00a0 I explained that when you leave nicely, you are more likely to be invited back soon.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nI then pulled out a new sheet of paper and we started with the same beginning but recreated the sequence of events as he would like them to unfold in the future.\u00a0 He decided that he could say, \"I don't want to leave!\" and he could feel as angry as he wanted to, but that he would leave without a tantrum, and we drew the whole thing as he described it.\u00a0 This sounds like a very long process but we really only spent about 10 minutes doing it.\u00a0 It's not about the art - it's about keeping the child's attention focused on the unfolding events - so it can move fairly quickly, depending on the situation and the child's processing speed. \n\nWe went back to that friend's house a great many times after that night and we never, ever had a problem leaving again.\u00a0 \n\nThere are as many ways to create a visual map of a social situation as there are different social situations for our kids to experience.\u00a0 There is no required format for this.\u00a0 Depending on the situation and the age of the child, you could create a cartoon strip, a flow chart, or any other picture that shows a sequence.\u00a0 The important part is that you visually and simply represent the ways in which the child's actions impacted other people's feelings and how they thought about him, and led to a specific outcome.\u00a0 Having the opportunity to remap the situation is critical!\u00a0 Your child will not learn enough from simply seeing the unsuccessful scenario portrayed; he needs an opportunity to think through an alternate ending in order to use different behavior the next time something similar arises.\u00a0 \n\nMichelle Garcia Winner has a recent publication called Social Behavior Mapping which will undoubtedly provide many terrific strategies, and Carol Gray (who came up with the concept of Social Stories) has a great little book called Comic Book Conversations which outlines another means of using visual support to aid understanding of language within social situations.\u00a0 \u00a0There is always more to learn about helping our children and clients improve in their social thinking; we are so fortunate to have these experts as resources.\n\nThose of you in the Bay Area might be interested to know that Michelle Garcia Winner and Carol Gray are running a workshop together December 4th and 5th in San Francisco. They are very parent-friendly speakers! \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://fromherethereandback.blogspot.com/2007/09/what-i-didnt-learn-in-cafeteria.html", "http://fromherethereandback.blogspot.com/", "https://www.socialthinking.com/", "http://www.thegraycenter.org/", "http://www.socialthinking.com/product.asp?specific=118", "http://www.thegraycenter.org/store/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&category_ID=6"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/09/map-it.html", "title": "Map It!"},
{"date": "March 04, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tBy Jordan Sadler, SLP\n\nMy 4-year old client threw himself on the floor and cried when sharp adult scissors were taken away from him, but wailed, \"I'm happy, I'm happy...\" \n\nA 5-year old girl grabbed something from me and then immediately socked me in the nose when she saw my sad facial expression.\n\nAnother young boy, startled when his little sister cried, insisted to me, \"Abby's happy.\u00a0 She's not sad!\u00a0 She's happy!\"\n\n****\n\nSusan recently proposed a topic that has been on my professional radar a great deal lately.\u00a0 That is, why is it that some children want everyone to be happy at all times, and how can we help them process and accept negative emotions better?\n\nI think there are probably quite a few opinions out there explaining why this is.\u00a0 Last week I had the great fortune of having meetings with two colleagues - first I met with Liesl Wenzke Hartmann, SLP of Communication Therapy in San Francisco, and then with Emily Rubin, SLP, one of the creators of the SCERTS Model, a comprehensive educational program for children with autistic spectrum disorders.\u00a0 I wanted to hear what each of them thinks this is all about, and their answers made good sense so I will try to summarize our conversations for you.\n\nOne of the core deficits in autism is difficulty in predicting social behavior in others.\u00a0 To borrow a statement straight out of a SCERTS workshop hand-out, \"Individuals with ASD have neurological differences that impact their ability to predict the intentions of others, comprehend social cues and share their intentions with others.\" \n\nA developmentally young child with ASD who has difficulty predicting the intentions of others will have a very hard time knowing what is going to happen to him next, even when his communication partners think that they are making it very clear (e.g., putting on jackets and shoes, getting the car keys, saying, \"Let's go to Target!\").\u00a0 The child is then picked up \"out of the blue\" from an enjoyable activity at home by his loving parents and taken outside where he is strapped into his car seat or stroller and perhaps brought to a noisy store or play group.\u00a0 This can be confusing and dysregulating, which in turn has the potential to make a \"simple outing\" a great challenge to parents again and again.\u00a0 Tension builds in the family's day-to-day life as everything starts to feel like a battle.\u00a0 \n\nIn addition, the child may see absolutely no logic behind someone else's emotional reaction.\u00a0 His sister, from his perspective, quite often begins to tantrum out of nowhere, which is very startling and - again - dysregulating.\u00a0 If a child does not see it coming, because he has trouble reading social cues, he has no opportunity to initiate soothing strategies such as moving closer to Mom, covering his ears, or leaving the room to find his sippy cup before the tantrum escalates. The world becomes an unpredictable, often frightening, and stressful place.\n\nNo matter what the particular situations are, this child is developing what the SCERTS collaborators call negative emotional memory around a great many things; things as simple as Mom getting her keys or his sister starting to cry.\u00a0 He has not yet had enough opportunities to:\u00a0 a) predict the occurrence of something challenging, b) use coping strategies for self-regulation, or c) learn over time that he can make his way through these difficult feelings without becoming dysregulated.\u00a0 Therefore, he experiences negative emotions but doesn't really connect meaning to them, becoming dysregulated immediately when he feels them.\u00a0 And, when he has enough language to do so, may try to deny them out of fear.\u00a0 \n\nPut another way, in the words of the SCERTS folks, \"When a child is not able to predict the actions of others and has limited history of positive emotional experiences in social interactions, social experiences become threatening, anxiety provoking, and worthy of avoidance.\"\n\n****\n\nLet's face it.\u00a0 As a society, we are very uncomfortable with negative emotions.\u00a0 Adults so often say to a child, \"Come on now, don't cry about that!\" or \"There's no reason to be so mad,\" or \"That's a silly thing to be sad about!\"\u00a0 We tend to try to safeguard young people from those challenging emotions, especially our children with special needs, figuring they've got enough to deal with already. But the hard truth is that we must all learn to predict, cope with, and succeed in moving through negative emotions in order to feel comfortable with them and continue on our way up the developmental ladder.\n\n[Part Two will address how to help guide children through this process.]\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.communicationtherapy.net/", "http://www.communicationtherapy.net/liesl.html", "http://www.commxroads.com/About.aspx", "http://www.scerts.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/03/some-thoughts-o.html", "title": "Navigating Negative Emotions (Part One)"},

We were eating dinner and he was explaining to me how everything had changed in the world and most people were like him, and there were very few people left who understood the old world. Also, some of these people had kids who understood the old world but not the new one. And Isaac was helping them to understand the new world.\"\n\nSusan's dream:\n\"We got our kindergarten placement form in the mail.  I ripped it open, scanned down the paper and saw that Isaac had been assigned to some random school I'd never heard of.

{"date": "March 06, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tI'm too sleepy to turn this into anything more than a fragment of what's on my mind tonight, but here it is: Isaac's first-ever representational drawing, I believe.  Yep, that's me, with the big potato head. It's quite true to life, actually, though my eyes are just a tad greener.\n\nThis drawing didn't just spring from the font of Isaac's inspiration, but that makes it no less sweet.  Well, bittersweet.  I'll explain.  Any day now, we'll hear about his kindergarten placement.  I've written about our angsty angst in several places--no need to repeat.  But one of the things our intervention team has been focused on lately is to prepare him for the sort of normal things that kindergartners do: draw pictures and sign them, cut with scissors, paint.  I obsess about that.  About the start of school, and the increased expectations and social pressure and structure, and the inevitable (good, scary) transition to growing up.  Because it means we're going to have to pick our battles: where we're willing to diverge, where we'll have to work harder if we want to swim in the mainstream.\n\nSo this drawing? It represents me, but it also evokes this odd tension: the desire to help Isaac participate in more of the norms of childhood, mixed with the inevitable loss of spontaneity when we have to think about every new skill so deliberately.  Like any kid, Isaac will always have his preferences, his talents and his blind spots.  But I don't want to fuss with the music of his personality.  It's like Bach and Monk all rolled together: mathematical, precise, but also prone to riffs and digressions that take us to places that seem fresh and wild and unexpected and beautiful.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/03/sketchbook.html", "title": "Sketchbook"},
{"date": "March 09, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tWe received our letter from the school district yesterday, and I am happy to say that we got one of our choices.  Not the most popular, not the closest, but a good school--one with an involved parent group, a lot of diversity, and a very nice inclusion teacher (who I've met).  I think we can work with it.\n\nCompared to the majority of the general ed population, we made out like bandits.  We've been reading The SF K Files, started by a smart and witty woman named Kate to chronicle her experience applying to kindergarten.  She applied to seven schools and didn't get a single one on her list.  When I went to sleep last night, her update post had 161 comments.  I just checked again: 243.  There's a lot to say about public education in San Francisco. It's odd--being in the \"special needs\" category paradoxically worked to our advantage this time.  Go figure.\n\nEverything is a leap of faith.  \n\nYesterday, Isaac told me, \"I don't want to play Teletubbles, and I don't want to play elevators, so I want to play letters.\"  It was his very first sort-of conditional statement.  Then, last night as I sang Edelweiss in an effort to lull him to sleep, he thought it would be a good idea to add his own contributions to the end of every line so that \"Blossom of snow/May you bloom and grow\" became \"Bloom and poop/Bloom and poop forever.\"  And he burst into giggles at his wit.  I'm not sure that Austrians would appreciate his artistry, but it was a thing of beauty to me.\n\nRight now, he's sitting behind me on the couch, arms wrapped around my neck as I type.  As I lean toward the computer, he pulls me back into a hug, smiling a little half-smile.\n\nEverything is a leap of faith.  \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://thesfkfiles.blogspot.com/2008/03/sfusd-assignments.html", "http://thesfkfiles.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/03/the-envelope-pl.html", "title": "The envelope please..."},

I had a little brainstorm, and asked him if he saw a number nine on the page.  He studied the book for a moment, and a slow grin spread across his face.

Young Isaac had spiked a fever this weekend, and spent most of Sunday lolling in the bed in a hot, drowsy stupor.  Even though he seemed perfectly fine and (mostly) cool this morning, I do not ever want to be THAT MOM--YOU KNOW--THE ONE WHO BRINGS HER SICK KID TO SCHOOL AND RUNS AWAY, so I obeyed the rules and kept him home today.  \n\nWhat is it about fevers anyway?  Why don't they ever hit on Friday night so that said young person is well and happy by Monday--never a good day to take off? But I digress. This morning, Isaac was, thankfully, much cooler and felt much better. Unfortunate side-effect: he was also into EVERYTHING.\n\nI try, I really do, to be a good (working) mom, but days like this fray my last nerve.  I have meetings, I have a sick kid, I have guilt.  Luckily, I also have a \"mute\" button on my phone, which comes in handy for those conference calls when certain people show up, loudly demanding another episode of Dora the Explorer, just as I am moving to the next brilliant slide in my PowerPoint.\n\nSo I did what I hate to do (but rationalize when Isaac is ill): I let him play on the computer.  A lot.\n\nFinally, I hit the limit of what I thought he should have and what I could endure, and I gave him the five, three and one-minute warnings.  \n\nNo dice.\n\nA big meltdown ensued, in which Isaac yelled through his tears that he wanted Daddy to come home. I told him Daddy was at work, and wouldn't be home for several hours.  \n\nWrong answer. And then...Eureka!  \"Okay,\" I replied calmly, \"Then I'll be Daddy.\"  And I put on J's trademark yellow baseball cap and his red fleece, and said, \"See?  I'm Daddy!\" Oh the hilarity.  We took turns \"being Daddy\" for a good long while. We played I Spy.  We wrestled.

It was the usual sort for girls: some kind of pink pattern on the outside, a flimsy brass lock, gold-lined paper.  I would shut myself in my room, put The Carpenters' Rainy Days and Mondays on the record-player, and set out to write My Thoughts and Feelings About Life. I did this religiously for about three days, but subsided after I realized that 1) I didn't feel comfortable expressing my deepest thoughts on paper; 2) I wasn't sure I knew what my deepest thoughts were anyway; 3) my second-deepest thoughts weren't really that interesting; and 4) someone might read it.  \n\nFor the next decade or so, I shifted to poetry, adopting the style of whoever I happened to be reading at the time.  The trajectory went something like this:\n\nOgden Nash ---> Homer ----> Sylvia Plath ---> Sylvia Plath ---> W.B. Yeats ---> John Ashbery ---> various French Surrealists filtered through bitter and pretentious older boyfriend...\n\nAgain, the life experience problem.  I wasn't middle-aged and/or wry, blind, Greek, suicidal, Irish, French or an emigre.  I had not lived in Europe.  I had not seen wars, the Louvre, an orgy, death, or experienced a relationship lasting longer than a semester.  Worst of all, I had no world-weariness (except the type affected by twenty-somethings who have seen Breathless and Jules and Jim too many times).  \n\nThen I discovered translation. The advantage was clear: I could do something creative without having actually to write anything original myself.  Unfortunately, I didn't know Italian that well, and it's painstaking work. Finally I started working, and eventually gave up writing altogether.  But I still thought of myself as a writer.  \n\nWhen I started this blog, I had no grand ambitions for it.  Yes, I wanted to tell our story, connect with other people and preserve the thread of these experiences.

{"date": "November 15, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tTwice, TWICE in as many weeks, people have asked J. that question.  The first time was a student and this last was a stranger on the streetcar.  J. and Isaac were riding along, happily snuggled up, when an odd, possibly homeless, possibly mentally ill man asked Isaac his name.  And Isaac answered him.  And then the guy turned to Jesse.  \"Is he autistic?\"  \"He's on the spectrum,\" J. allowed, trying to be minimally polite without encouraging any further conversation.  The guy continued anyway.  \"Yeah, I have a relative who's autistic.  They're all God's beautiful children...\" And he started to sing a little tune to himself.  J. turned away and tuned out.  \n\nThe worst part, he told me later, was that they were just sitting there.  And Isaac talked to a total stranger.  And the guy still knew.  \n\nThis thing of knowing, of being reminded we're different--it's still hard.  I've been talking to a lot of my friends with special kids lately, and so many of us struggle with this.  We love and appreciate our children so fully, yet we fear that the rest of the world won't get past their differences to see their many gifts and beauties.  We don't want to deny their differences--in fact, they are often the source of their gifts--but we have to admit we've come to understand them gradually, with the benefit of the intimate daily knowledge that one can only have of a deeply loved friend or family member.  And no, it's not fair to expect that level of insight from the strangers on the bus, or at the mall, or at the grocery store.  Or, for that matter, the kindergarten you may or may not be applying to.  \n\nI am beginning to feel that the biggest, toughest gift we can give our children is to help others see that special needs are nothing to be awkward about or afraid of--to see our quirky, unique kids more through our eyes.  And that means we have to fight the fear that someone will, as a wise friend recently put it to me, occasionally see our slip showing.  \n\nOkay, I admit it--I used to be uncomfortable around people with disabilities.  It's as simple as that split-second question about whether to open the door for someone in a wheelchair: is it a basic courtesy, or might they think that I'm being condescending and assuming they're helpless?  I used to worry a lot about that--about how to act and what to do. And obsess afterwards: was I respectfully nonchalant, or did I just look like an ass?  I had no idea.  But one thing I know now: all that awkwardness is just...gone.  Poof!  \n\nThe guy on the streetcar?  He saw the slip.  I don't know how, I don't know why.  I don't think it much matters.

I have to admit I was pretty intimidated at the first tour, unsure of whether to \"out\" ourselves and take the chance that we'd be remembered as the family that will be FAR TOO MUCH WORK TO ACCOMMODATE, rather than the helpfully candid, friendly and reasonable sorts that we are.  So I asked the dreaded question, but wasn't sure if it was really the right thing to do.  And, well, you know how that turned out.\n\nThis time I was more blunt.  While the other parents asked stuff like \"when do the children learn to read?\" and \"when do the children learn to read?\" and \"sorry, but when do the children learn to read?\" I took a breath and asked about what their accommodations were for children with special needs.  The first grade teacher I asked was refreshingly relaxed about the whole thing.  She said all the right things, which I loved.  And she knew what she was talking about: wiggle chairs, fidgets, vestibular input, the whole deal.  The learning specialist was similarly prepared (did the other school call and tell them I was coming?!?)  But it will come down to money, eventually.  None so far will provide support in the classroom, which pretty much includes us out.\n\nTwo down, a few bazillion to go.\n\n***\nWe're having a run of developmental bursts lately--great stuff.  And it comes at the oddest times.  Isaac is on the mend from some sort of virus, and last night he was feverish, sweaty, miserable, and coughing up a storm.  At a certain point he looked at me, tears streaming down his little red face, and wailed, \"I want to be BETTER!\"    I had to stop myself from laughing out loud.  And then Beata tells me he woke up about an hour after I left this morning, warm again.  \"Poor Isaac,\" she said, putting a hand to his head.  \"You look sad,\" he answered. \n\nRemind me again why we have to sell our kids to these schools?  Shouldn't we be doing a reverse auction, where they bid for the privilege of teaching them?  \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/11/i-went-to-anoth.html", "title": "The Kindergarten Dance, Part II"},
{"date": "November 17, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tToday was one of those days that felt like transition after transition, interspersed with brief moments of calm.  It was probably that Isaac isn't feeling 100 percent yet after a week-long bout with some sort of respiratory virus.  And when he's tired, he's edgy.  And when he's edgy, he refuses to go to the potty.  And when that happens, everything goes sideways.\n\nToday we decided to escape the city and drive about an hour south for a little fresh air.  We had lunch at the Palo Alto Creamery, a venerable institution serving burgers and fries to Silicon Valley residents for, well, a very long time.  And, voila, refusal to go after.  Loud refusal.  Attention-grabbing refusal.  \"Why-don't-we-leave-and-try-later?\" refusal.\n\nSo, okay, fine, we're trying not to make a tug-of-war out of this.  For one thing, it's no fun.  For another, it's way too Freudian.  So we gave up and took a walk outside, where we passed Waterworks, an incredibly elegant and expensive store selling, what else--incredibly elegant and expensive bathroom fixtures.  Isaac nearly yanked my arm off in his excitement, so in we went.  We walked past model after gorgeous model of bathrooms that I could spend a lifetime in: huge, cozy ceramic tubs, sculpted sinks, plush towels, gorgeous tile, and yes--the finest in lavatory design.    \n\nImmediately it became evident that Isaac thought these floor models were there for his personal use.  Luckily, I thought fast.  \"Isaac, these potties don't really work.  They're just, uh, pretend.\"  (As the absurdity of that remark hit me, I realized that it was now inevitable: I was destined to blog about this.  How meta is that?)  We dashed to the counter and in my most charming harried mother voice, I asked if we could use their facilities.  The woman behind the counter glanced at me, glanced down at Isaac, and suggested we try across the street at the Creamery--the very bathroom Isaac had just loudly rejected out of hand.\n\nCrap.\n\nIsaac looked a bit more urgent now, and yanked me back to the floor models for another try.  On the way, we ran into another saleswoman, who asked if we needed any help.  \"Um yes,\" I asked, all harried mommy charm again, \"Do you happen to have a public restroom?\"  (Pleading look at child).  \"Certainly,\" she said crisply and led us to the back, where, sure enough, there was a sparkling-clean, quiet-yet-understated restroom.  Mission accomplished.\n\nOn the way out the door, Isaac glanced back into the store window.  \"Lots of potties!\" he exclaimed, grinning at us.    \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.paloaltocreamery.com/", "http://www.waterworks.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/11/to-pee-perchanc.html", "title": "No Restroom for the Weary"},

{"date": "November 26, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tFour days of no therapy, no work, no school, no obligations--just hanging out, cooking, baking (okay, with a mix--let's not get carried away here).  And--luxury of luxuries--I'm taking the day off today to write, clean the house, meet a friend, and, yes, watch a little Oprah before I pick Isaac up. The morning is off to a great start: slept in (a little), played \"I Spy\" with Isaac on the walk to school, got a jaunty wave bye-bye, came home to a cup of gooood coffee, a little pumpkin bread, Caetano Veloso on the stereo.  What could be better?  \n\nSometimes I forget, you know?  Forget the two schools, four therapies, five upcoming and two past Kindergarten tours, the tantrums, the worry, the fear, the economic and psychic and social and other pressures.  And in the land of the compulsively overanalytical, a day off is both a blessing and a curse.  Because it gives you time to think.\n\nAre we doing all the right things?  Are we doing enough of them?\n\nIf you listen to all the competing therapies, you'll hear a familiar strain.  More. Earlier.  Better outcomes.  In the early days of our diagnosis, that was both reassuring (okay, we know what to do) and terrifying (Holy crap! How do we get it all done?)  And then there is the question of how much change a family can withstand before it cracks under the pressure.  And I do not mean this lightly.  And it expands geometrically if you have more than one child (on or off the spectrum), or a child with extraordinary medical needs.\n\nAround the time Isaac was two, we had a therapist (I'll call her Naomi) who pushed all our buttons (especially fast forward).  We were still struggling with accepting Isaac's diagnosis, which was compounded by the fact that he was (and continues to be) much more engaged with us at home than he was in unfamiliar surroundings.  She told us, and we knew, that the DIR (Floortime) model strongly suggests eight 20-minute sessions per day.  And that in addition to OT, speech, school and ABA, which we were just starting.  If we did everything that was asked of us, Isaac would be in therapy all day, every day.  It wasn't possible.  And it wasn't right.\n\nWe struggled with this for a long time. And then we'd break for the holidays, go East to see J's family, and have a week of unstructured time with family and cousins.  And you know what?  He acted out, sure.  He had some really rough times.  But every single trip, he'd make a developmental leap.\n\nI often joke that Isaac has a more complicated schedule than either of his parents, and it's true. But he's four years old.  And I admit it: when he comes home, he gets to watch a little TV.  And if he wants to take every car out of the toy basket and examine it before putting it down, we let him do it for a whie.  Is he learning anything in those moments?  Probably not.  Does it look perseverative?  Yeah, sometimes.  Is it constructive?  Yes.  Because the kid needs a break.  He needs time to process it all, let it sink in, snuggle up to Mommy, eat a few cheese crackers and just watch Sesame Street.  \n\nAnd every single time, there's a little voice in my head: should I try to engage him? Should I turn this moment into a game?  Am I wasting precious potential therapeutic opportunities?  But then I remember that my son has emotional as well as developmental needs.  And I tell the little voice to shut up.  \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.peets.com/fvpage.asp?rdir=1&", "http://www.universalmusic.com.br/artistas/caetano_veloso/ce_ao_vivo/index.html"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/11/four-days-of-no.html", "title": "The Pause Button"},

I've been wanting to write a follow-up to the whole Ransom Notes campaign, but I think I'm still brooding about it. One thing I'll say, though: this experience has been extremely valuable (just not in the way the creators intended) because it has illuminated the incredible complexity of what we're getting into when we talk about disability: who's talking, who's being talked about, who has the microphone, who is the subject, and, most importantly, the fine, shfting line between disability and difference, personality and pathology.\n\nI don't mean to overdramatize here, but I do think we're at the beginning of something critically important.  To me, the most telling sign is that this campaign has become a rallying point for many people with autism and a way to get their voices heard; for that I am profoundly grateful.\n\nIt's like this, isn't it, when movements gather momentum.  It starts with something apparently ordinary, and then it shifts: policemen raid a bar where a few friends of Dorothy are having a drink, a woman refuses to give up her seat on the bus, a few colonists board a ship and dump boxes of tea into the harbor.

Unfortunately, my baking skills veer widely between lucky and inedible.  As my husband once said about one of my creations: \"these scones are kinda tasty.\"  \"Those aren't scones,\" I pouted. \"They're lemon cookies.\"  Oh.\n\nSo a week spent thinking about kidnapping and ransom notes and the delicate balance between remediation and respect for neurodiversity somehow morphed last night into needing to bake something.  Last night I pulled a box of cake mix off the shelf which I had purchased recently in a fit of domestic romanticism.  Being a full-time working mom, I like at least to entertain the illusion that I've got game in the household skills department.\n\nWhat I neglected to notice, however, was that 1) I did not have enough canola oil; and 2) the chocolate cake mix i had purchased was vegan.  Now I am a great believer in healthy eating, but some things (chocolate being among them) are sacrosanct.  So I tarted it up a bit, with an egg, a bit of butter, and some shaved chocolate.  It did the trick decently well, but J. admitted after a few bites that it still tasted kind of, well, \"vegany.\"  And so I guess I need to go back to basics to get the desired effect: eggs, milk, butter, flour, chocolate.

{"date": "December 14, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\t I took the day off today, by which I mean I didn't go to work and instead focused on all things Isaac.  J. dropped him off at school and met me at yet another kindergarten tour.  This one is public, small, beautifully cared for and very well funded.  But in each of these schools I really have to wonder what inclusion means to them.  Is it truly a philosophy that all kids can be enriched by each other?  Or, like other diversity issues, is it clouded by mis- and preconceptions, fear and outmoded ways of thinking?  I think there's a lot of good will here, I really do, but I worry that our schools are overwhelmed by a demand for these services that far exceeds their supply--of resources and of knowledge.  \n\nWhen I got to Isaac's school to pick him up, he was happily crawling through a cardboard playhouse.  He peered at me through the door, grinned impishly, wriggled out and barreled straight into my arms.  His teachers have been really upbeat lately about his progress--more engagement, a lot happier and more regulated, more sophisticated speech.  It feels really good, really right.\n\nHe held my hand and happily munched a banana as we walked down the hill to the car on the way to his OT play group.  When we first started at OT, he was so small and so dysregulated; his favorite activity was to open and close the closet doors relentlessly, or run circuits around the room, both of which chilled me but which his therapists handled with a sort of cheerful aplomb.  In those days, I had no idea what we were in for, and I watched every movement, every glance for a clue: did he look up? Smile at her? Notice the other child who walked in?  Are we in the clear yet?  Can we go now? Oh, I had a lot to learn.  \n\nToday, Isaac happily played among (I hesitate to say with, exactly) two other boys, and wasn't too distracted to have me there, though he looked over a lot and, I think, showed off a bit. Way to go, pal.\n\nAfter a break, I took Isaac to his old preschool to see P., a former teacher he's been mentioning lately.  That first fretful year felt like a daily ration of doom.  Isaac was two, wordless, and, we were beginning to realize, so distant from the other children.  His primary teacher seemed completely unable to incorporate him into the classroom play, and when I picked him up in the afternoon I'd often find him aimlessly wandering the playground while the other kids played in small clusters.  If P. was there, Isaac would usually be in his arms, snuggled up or standing close by, his anchor against the chaos.  And if P. had left, I'd know Isaac had been with him by the traces of cologne I could still smell in Isaac's hair.  It reassured me, and it broke my heart.  We changed preschools the next year.\n\nIn January, we'll take a deep breath, turn in our kindergarten applications and begin yet another chapter of this story. I am already fretting about this transition, even as I hope (and even feel) that he'll probably weather it better than I will. \n\nWhen we got to Isaac's old school, P. was waiting by the door. Isaac said hi, and his whole body wriggled with excitement. And then he started moving around the room, looking into nooks, peering out windows, reacquainting himself with the layout of the place.  It was clear he was happy to see P., but it was too much for him and soon his explorations turned into a fixed circuit: to the table, to the doorway, to the sink, to the other door, back to the table.  After a few minutes of friendly, awkward conversation, we left.\n\nWhen I think about what distinguishes me and other mothers of children with special needs from parents of other kids, the thing I always come back to is the scrutiny of every action, every word, every expression for a sign of what's to come.  And it's exhausting, really, reading every tea leaf.  I'm not sure if I can give it up yet, but as Isaac grows older I am going to have to learn to let him set the tone.  Slowly, he's starting to teach me.  Slowly, I'm learning.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/12/i-took-the-day.html", "title": "School Daze"},

{"date": "September 03, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tSomeday in the future when I look back at Isaac's childhood (no rush, just musing), I think the thing that will stand out most is the juxtapositions: the sly, playful mischevious boy, the withdrawn, hair-trigger boy, the milestones effortlessly reached and the ones we struggle against, time and time again.\n\nWe arranged for a babysitter on Saturday, as much for some alone time as to have lunch together and attempt an actual adult conversation.  While we were gone, P (who hails from Argentina) played a spinning game with Isaac in which she counted in Spanish while he spun five times in each direction.  By the time we got home, he was happily counting in Spanish.  Then today we took a walk and to take the cable car downtown (it's amazing, actually, that you can live someplace for years and never do even the most basic touristy things).  Isaac had a great time, though it was a little loud at times.  But he put his hands over his ears and did just fine.  Until we tried to get him into a bathroom and...big honking meltdown.  He simply refused to enter a public restroom (even ones he'd heppily been in before) and couldn't really explain what the problem was.  Was it the noise?  We tried a quieter one.  Was it the size?  We tried a smaller one.  Drink more?  No impact.  We tried for hours, and...no dice. \n\nAt one point, when we were aimlessly wandering around outside, unsure of what to do, we saw a sign that said \"Bay.\"  J. asked Isaac, who has lately been addicted to Starfall, what he thought that spelled.  \"B-A-Y,\" said Isaac.  \"Bay.\"  We were stunned.  We took him inside, and pointed out another sign, this time with a longer word.  He looked up, mouthing the letters silently.  \"Elevator,\" he said.  Oy. \n\nAnd yet.  I ask this child, whose favorite word lately is \"stupendous\" (as of yesterday, narrowly edged out by \"quatorce,\" pronounced by J. with an excellent trill) why he wouldn't go to the public restroom.  And he can't answer me.  \"Was it scary?\"  Silence.  \"Was it too loud?\" \"Yes,\" he whispers, but I'm not sure that's true...the last one we tried was completely perfect and quiet.  So I don't know.   There are so many blessings to be counted, so much to take heart from, but today I just feel achy and tired and in need of, in the following order, some answers and a slice of chocolate cake.  The cake is on the counter, slowly coming to room temperature.  But the answers?  \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.starfall.com/", "http://www.tartinebakery.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/09/when-i-look-bac.html", "title": "Piece of Cake"},

Thanks to all of you for the support, suggestions and, really, just for stopping by.  If I didn't live in a flat in a big city, and it was a different kind of world, I would have a pie cooling on the windowsill, and cut nice big wedges of it and serve it with a strong cup of coffee when you dropped by for a chat.  (That, by the way, is in the universe in which we're all neighbors, pies have no calories, coffee doesn't make us jittery, no one works, and afternoons are long, slow and sunny, with a slight breeze through the back door.)  That, my friends, is my idealized version of family room hospitality.  \n\n***\nSaw a friend the other day.  J. was sweet enough to drive me down to her house, and Isaac, who loves a drive, was thrilled.  When we got there, she led us around to the back, where she parked her shiny, red, two-seater rental.  Isaac took one look at it and was struck silent for a moment.  Then, in a tone of utmost awe, as if he'd seen a miracle first hand, he uttered the following: \"spoooortscaaarrr!\"  And insisted on getting in and \"driving.\"  My friend was kind enough to oblige, and boy was he delighted, over and over again, until we insisted on going in the house (and he melted down quite spectacularly, but that's for another day). \n\n***\nFirst week of school is shaping up pretty well so far.  We've already gotten invitations to two birthday parties, and I'm rethinking our strategy for what to do this year.  As Isaac gets older, his difficulties--with noise, crowds, chaos, social situations, etc.--become more evident in these types of gatherings.  So we're trying to figure out the best way to participate without overstressing him, or our hosts.  I think a call to the moms for a better sense of what's planned will help, coupled with a guilt-free escape plan should it prove to be too much for him, us or the birthday boy or girl.\n\n***\nSigning off now.  J., who heroically got the man of the hour to bed tonight, is grading paprs and just flipped on the Sundance Channel, which is featuring Breathless (the original, with Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo).  What fun to see him, in his fedora, sunglasses and perpetual cigarette, and her, so fresh and gamine in her cropped hair and striped t-shirt.  No fanny packs, no Crocs, no scrunchies, no toy recalls or large grocery bags filled with healthy snacks, just jazz in the background, stylish and artless and free, trapped forever inside that little flickering silver box.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053472/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/09/sleeping-gettin.html", "title": "Breathless in San Francisco"},

{"date": "November 01, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tI want Jacques Offenbach!  I want Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart!\n\nHonestly, things just keep getting weirder and weirder over here.  And, you may wonder, what four-year-old makes this particular request?  It turns out that our good friend Starfall, which Isaac adores, has a music section, and our boy is lately quite enamored of the Can-Can.  Or at least the music.  I am wondering if we should bring this up at OT? After all, it would be pretty cool if we could get him to dance to it.  Lots of sequencing there.  My son, the future Rockette.\n\nNaturally, we had to call Grandpa right away and inform him of his grandson's newfound musical leanings (he's a musicologist, so presumably more impressed by the Mozart than the Offenbach, but that's his call).\n\n***\nThe fatigue hit me like a wall today: an overnight cross-country trip to New York, the IEP (which, in fairness, J. attended alone since I was somewhere over Ohio at the time), the whole Kindergarten thing, the recent school meeting...just so much paperwork, so many phone calls and so much to juggle.  We had this idea early on that if we went all out for a couple of years, we might be able to help Isaac past what we hoped was just a developmental pothole.  The good news: he's on a great track.  The bad news: this pace isn't sustainable, for any of us.  The therapies, the pressure...we have to find a way to simplify.  But where?  And how?\n\nIt's odd, though.  When I read Kristen or Drama Mama and see what Isaac might be like in two or four years, I feel reassured.  Sure, it's still hard, sure all kids are different, and sure it'll probably always be part of our identity, but it's wonderful to see GP and Miss M (and so many others!) growing into themselves.  \n\n***\nI remember first grade quite well, and fourth grade too.  I remember gazing out the window of P.S. 24 in the Bronx, watching the leaves change color and sway gently back and forth, and I remember feeling a sense of peace in the details of things, and a sense of terror at social expectations.  I don't think I had too many friends at school. I went to the birthday parties, I had a couple of playmates in our apartment building, and we all played in a jumble outside together, but I never had a sense of social ease, or, for that matter, a sense that friendship was natural or that I was much good at it.  It was hard work: worth it sometimes, and sometimes not.  And sometimes I simply preferred to hang upside down under the metal stairs behind our apartment, swaying back and forth and watching the sun move across my field of vision.\n\nI'm not saying I'm on the spectrum, unless you subscribe to the notion that we're all on a spectrum, with sales executives on one end and software developers on the other; easy to imagine here in the land of freeways and technology. But I do think that my identity and my son's are on a continuum, and I understand when he prefers solitude, or word play, or to watch the way his hand moves against the light in the window, to the clamor and expectation of social life.  And J. is the same--it's a huge part of what brought us together.\n\nI didn't mean to wax so philosophical tonight.  But a friend (an Internet friend--make of that what you will) sent me a note today in which she wondered whether some of these reports of \"recovered\" autism are simply the result of children growing out of their early inward focus.  I don't know if that's true, but it has a sort of intuitive rightness, at least for some kids.  What I do know is that most of my adult life has been a process of opening up to the world--work, love, marriage, motherhood--with all its risks and beauties.  It's brought me more than I ever knew I wanted, but I can't say it's all been easy.\n\nI wish the same for my son.  I want him to open himself to the world, bit by bit, come what may, and I know that it will inevitably bring him pain as well as unanticipated joys.  But I don't want to change an atom of who he is, the essence of him.  I want him to retain that inwardness that makes him Isaac: special, and smart, and dreamy like his father.  Of course, it's ridiculous to think that I have any choice in the matter: he will be who he will be.  Kindergarten, therapies, leaves on the trees, books, friends, holidays, day by day, year by year.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.starfall.com/n/level-b/music/load.htm?f", "http://fromherethereandback.blogspot.com/", "http://likeashark.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/11/i-want-jacques-.html", "title": "On Development, Identity and Dancing the Can-Can"},
{"date": "November 05, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tYou know how in those wonderful noirish spy movies of the 40s, one spy hisses to the other: \"Meet me at the newsstand. Wear a hat. And try and look normal.\"  \n\nIt recently occurred to me that while this was probably life-saving advice for B-movie spies, it is really bad advice for us: we spend entirely too much time and energy trying to look normal.  And I have come to realize that we are well beyond the point where we \"pass.\"  Even at four, Isaac is tall enough and mature enough that his language delays and some of his quirkier behaviors no longer blend in with his peers'.  In fact, a former student of J's who saw Isaac at school this past summer asked point blank if he was autistic.  J. was pretty thrown by this, until he discovered that the boy, a teenager, has an autistic sister.  You see, we don't really look at things that way most of the time.  Most of the time, we are in our world, where we understand and love each other, it all makes sense, and it's just so...normal.\n\nBut here it is.  Hat or not, we no longer look normal to at least part of the outside world.  It was clear at the museum yesterday, when Isaac refused to walk through the exhibits with us, insisting on endlessly riding the elevators.  It was clear when he sank to the floor of the foyer, screaming (Oh the echo on those beautiful granite walls. I apologize if you were there, I really do).  And it was clear when, cheered up and looking forward to snack, Isaac clearly requested a \"badel and milt\" (translation: \"bagel and milk\") from the cafeteria.  \n\nSo yeah, we've left normal, and we're somewhere else now.  \n\n***\nYesterday I heard a snippet of a talk with Steven Pinker, a Harvard psychology professor and specialist in language and cognition.  The Q&A had just started, and someone in the audience, a high school student, actually, asked Pinker why words that begin with positive or neutral associations can come to accumulate such negative ones over time.  They offered several examples, the most relevant being the slippery slope from \"crippled\" to \"handicapped\" to \"disabled\" to \"differently abled\" to...what exactly? \n\n\"Normal\" and \"typical,\" anyone?\n\nAnd Pinker pointed out that people change these words in an effort to destigmatize the underlying conditions that they describe, but inevitably the stigma grows back, until the word is on a kind of a linguistic treadmill.  And we are left with the blindingly obvious conclusion that we had better spend more time on erasing the stigma than changing the word.  Why it took a Harvard professor to tell me that, I will never know.\n\n***\nA couple of weeks ago we were on a kindergarten tour, and I asked the guide what accommodations are made for kids with special needs (another bizarre euphemism, which I of course use constantly).  And he seemed thrown by the question, and hemmed and hawed a bit, and finally said something to the effect that the school didn't divide kids into \"smarter\" and \"slower\" groups, but that they were very open to each child's learning style.  But, he continued, the school was probably not the right place for, uh, handicapped kids.  And the sad part was that he was trying, really trying, to be thoughtful, but he had no idea what to say.  \n\nLater in the tour, the head of admissions spoke, and she said that they were committed to serving a broad range of kids on the bell curve.  To her credit, she even said that kids' bell curves could be different, depending on the academic area.  [Good answer, thinks the mother greeted this morning both in Chinese and Japanese (Nihao! Konichiwa!) by her four-year-old.]  But I had to remind myself that, unlike my jeans, not many bell curves are made with at least five percent Lycra. \n\nAnd so I guess I am still struggling with this vision of what and who we are, and where we fit, and what it means.  And yes, I admit it, I am a big noodler, and it's either my best quality or my most annoying one, depending on your perspective.  But the most important part, the part I cannot yet answer, is how to let go--really let go--of normal.  \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/about/index.html"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/11/upon-reflection.html", "title": "Leaving Normal"},
{"date": "December 22, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tIsaac's school does a weekly newsletter.  It's a sweet thing, filled as it is with descriptions of the children's day: craft projects, climbing, turning the pumpkins into a science project as they begin, finally to rot.  Frequently, there are quotes from the children on a joint activity or event: What do you know about water?  What do you know about the holiday festivals of light? (we are an inclusive school, after all).  And these newsletters are always bittersweet for J. and me: the kids are really starting to understand how the world works, and they're becoming more and more articulate about what they know, and what they think they know.\n\nNext to their fanciful replies, Isaac's brief and cryptic utterances stand out.  And we are back to the eternal question: does he know but can't articulate?  Does he not know?  Is he paying attention?   Is he paying joint attention?  Can someone get me a tissue?\n\nSuddenly, from a preschool newsletter, we find ourselves hacking away at one of the most essential questions of philosophy: what comes first--language or thought?  And are they fundamentally dependent on each other?  \n\nThis becomes even more complex when you consider the outpouring of passionate arguments by people with autism against the recent \"Ransom Notes\" campaign.  I've been pondering this a lot recently, and have concluded that the campaign gave us all quite a gift: it allowed us to hear many voices we would not otherwise have heard, some of whom, I have to believe, don't speak.  I find this incredibly reassuring, and yet it also reminds me of my own preconceptions about how language and communication are supposed to work.   I wouldn't assume that someone speaking Finnish is incomprehensible, after all.  They're just incomprehensible to me.  And so it seems with autism.\n\nIsaac does not communicate in a conventional way.  Sure, he can speak, and can be extremely articulate when he wants something.  But his language is delayed and his pragmatics are really just emerging.  He also intersperses \"logical\" conversation with random rhyming, musings on elevators, buses, crackers, body parts and general observations about the material world.  I suspect that some of this is spectrum, and some is just being four: he's not at a point yet where he can screen out the (Hey, is that a hangnail?  Should I finish this sentence or go get the nail clippers now? No, I'll wait because then I can get another cup of) random thoughts that occur to each of us thousands of times a day.\n\nThe key, as we learn in Floortime and other humanistic therapies, is to find a way in: whatever it is.  And to remember that a \"disorder\" of communication isn't a one-way street: it does not abdicate the neurotypical from at least half the work of communication and understanding.  \n\nAnd yes, autism is scary, exhausting, financially draining, isolating--all those things.  But when I think about the gifts I've received from my child, I realize that one of the most important is that it's made me stop taking communication for granted.  I've had to work harder, be more flexible, approach things differently.  And when it works?  Oh my God. Nothing like it.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=23", "http://blogs.parentcenter.babycenter.com/momformation/2007/12/20/ransom-notes-campaign-is-history/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics", "http://www.floortime.org/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/12/isaacs-school-d.html", "title": "On ransom notes and rotting pumpkins "},

Sleeping: The ritual has evolved as follows: brush teeth, turn off lights, snuggle into Mommy and Daddy's bed, review day and say goodnight to a long list of friends, teachers, therapists, forms of transportation, inanimate objects and favorite activities (recent example: \"Goodnight, David.  Goodnight escalator.  Goodnight Skarloey. Goodnight number 22 bus...\"  Then off to bed accompanied either by Mommy or Daddy, followed by unpredictable falling asleep period lasting five minutes to two hours.  Expect one to two nighttime visitations, which are likely to end with family members scattered throughout the house in random sleeping arrangements.  Grade: C.\n\n2. Potty training:  Hooray!  We have become a (mostly) dry house, with a definite preference for \"big boy undies\" (aka \"BBUs\").  Number one is coming along great, while number two is a bit, um, scattershot.  Grade: A-.\n\n3. Behavior: Late afternoon is definitely witching hour--not too surprising.  We're hoping that a more mellow summer plan will be better for everyone.  Least favorite whine: \"I want steeeeeeeeeeeam engines!\" (aka Thomas the Train video).  He's mastered the long \"eeeeeee\" equivalent of nails on a chalkboard.  We fall for it more often than we'd like.  Grade: Pass.\n\n4. Language: The kid is getting skills, but still some pronoun confusion.  Imagine the looks we get when he hollers \"I want to take off your big boy undies!!!\" in public.  (Note: this comment is strongly correlated with unsuccessful outcomes in #2, above.) Also, when he's feeling oppositional, Isaac tends to begin sentences with \"I want more\" and \"I want no\" (fill in the blank).  Recently, during a particularly unpleasant episode, I gently and firmly suggested he stop whining in favor of more productive behavior.  His answer? \"I want more whining!\"  This is also frequently expressed in literal opposition.  For example, if I say \"Isaac, I want you to calm down,\" he will tell me: \"I want to calm up!\"  Grade: Hmmmm. Beeeeeeeeeeeee!\n\n5. Social Skills: Mixed here.  Definitely more evidence of social behavior at school, but playdates have been rough...more interested in the toys than the kids.  We'll keep trying and see what's what at the end of the summer. Grade: C-.\n\n6. Humor and happiness.  Always a strong suit.  Lately enchanted by using the \"monster voice\" to hilarious effect.  The kid's a comic genius.

I asked him if he knew what it was called. \"I don't know,\" he answered (this is pretty new, by the way, and it always tickles me when he says it).  So I told him it was called a forehead, at which point he paused, grinned, and said, \"I want Daddy's five shoulders.\" (Pause, giggle). \"Six knees.\"  (Guffaw).  \"Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen toes.\"  It took me a full hour to realize that he was counting out the song \"Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes.\"  (Okay, the counting is a little shaky--but still...)\n\nFor Father's Day, I took J. for a much-needed massage, lovely dinner (can I just tell you?  Filet of sole over sauteed fava beans and carrots and fennel and bacon. I cannot imagine a life in which I will ever have time again to shell and peel fava beans, but they are so yummy.)  It was also--ta-da!--our very first full night away from you-know-who.  Everyone survived pretty much intact.  I phoned Beata a mere three times in 19 hours, which I thought was kinda heroic, considering.  And we all got a reasonable night's sleep.  \n\nAs Isaac's Nonna says, \"Good night, sleep tight, happy dreams!\"\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/06/tonight_while_s.html", "title": "Odds and Ends on Father's Day"},
{"date": "June 20, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tA few weeks ago, Jen Graf Groneberg wrote a lovely piece on ParentDish called Singing to My Children, in which she recounts her gradual acceptance of the power of her own singing voice as a way to connect with her boys.  It's such a sweet post, full as it is of her insecurities and how she ultimately shrugged them off as she discovered how much her kids loved music--her music.  I sent her a note afterward, a little ruefully telling my own story early on with Isaac.  I had decided on day one that I would be a lullaby-singing kind of Mom, and hoped that it would bring Isaac and me closer together and represent a sweet, intimate moment of peace and communion between us before he fell asleep each night.  Ahh, romantic sap that I was.  Then one night, as I softly sang the mockingbird lullaby (\"Hush little baby, don't say a word...\"), Isaac raised his head from the pillow, pulled his damp thumb from his mouth, looked me straight in the eye, and softly whispered...\"Noooo.\"     \n\nThis led to a lullaby recession, in which we focused more on made-up bedtime stories (latest favorite is about a large pink monster with two noses and two mouths, named, according to Isaac, \"Very Mad\").  But one night a couple of weeks ago he was having a rough time getting to sleep, so I asked him if he wanted me to rub his back.  \"Yes,\" he whispered from underneath the covers.  So I starting rubbing his back and in a moment found myself singing \"Mockingbird.\"  Oh the excitement.  \"I want Mommy sing Mockingbird again!\"  A few weeks have gone by and we have added Toora Loora to the playlist.  If you don't know it, it's a sweet Irish lullaby that my Mother used to sing to me when I was about Isaac's age.  We have absolutely no claim to it, seeing as how not a drop of Irish blood runs through our veins, but we're hoping we can borrow it anyway for at least another generation. It's just lovely, and very, very soothing.\n\nSo now I'm on a little bit of a lullaby bender, looking for the next candidate.  Jen likes \"Edelweiss,\" which I have always loved, but it has the distinct disadvantage of making me cry nearly every time I hear or sing it.  So who knows?  We may have to get a little creative.  Not long ago, I overheard J. singing Isaac to sleep with \"I Want You to Want Me\" by Cheap Trick (a sentimental favorite: the first album he ever bought).  So while we may diverge from the tried and true, at least I am secure in the knowledge that, just like Kajagoogoo, I am ready for my comeback.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.parentdish.com/", "http://www.parentdish.com/2007/06/07/singing-to-my-children/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_Little_Baby", "http://www.babycenter.com/general/6738.html", "http://www.kajagoogoo.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/06/singing-who-kne.html", "title": "I Want More Mockingbird!"},

But here's the thing: I've been following this story for a while now, queasily watching the Google alerts pile up in my email box, and I'm no closer to any kind of perspective than I was at the beginning.  But I am certain of one thing: this story is well past the point where taking a position is anything other than (in the immortal words of David Bowie), \"putting out fire with gasoline.\"  \n\nWhat I can say--what I want to say--is that if you suspend judgment for a moment on the arguments and the experts and the celebrities and the posturing and the statistics, what's left is very simple and very stark: a lot of families in a lot of pain, trying to do what they believe to be right for their kids.  I don't pretend to have answers--I'm as much in the dark as everyone else who is navigating this crazy journey.  But I do have one rule: when I put my son to bed at night, I try not to think much about what it is that caused him to be different.  I just love him, the essence of him, and whether or not he can put it into words, I want him to feel it in his bones as he drops off to sleep.  \n\nNote: this piece is cross-posted on the Silicon Valley Moms blog.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/18/us/18autism.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/", "http://svmomblog.typepad.com/silicon_valley_moms_blog/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/06/lets_call_a_tru.html", "title": "Let's Call a Truce in the Autism Wars"},

Took Isaac to school in the morning to find that one of his teachers was at a doctor's appointment and they were a little short-staffed. So I stuck around with Isaac, read Harold and The Purple Crayon twice, and, when he was ready, we made our way to the table with the other kids.  There were four trays, each with a selection of magnetized objects: balls, colored discs, metallic bits of different shapes and sizes, and big magnetized paddles to pick it all up with.  We contented ourselves with making long strings of magnet balls and arranging them into the shapes of numbers and letters--big fun.  Soon a couple of the other kids got into the game, and I found myself becoming the impromptu ringleader.  \"A., that's beautiful! Let's see how big we can make it.  Isaac, what number does this look like?  E, that's great--uh-oh, it all fell down!  Let's start again.\"  Smiles all around, so lovely to be surrounded by all these kids, so good for the soul.\n\n***\n\nWhen I got home, my dad was waiting on the front steps.  I'd invited him to visit for some father-daughter time and see Isaac's therapies, since he's always been curious about what they are like. When it was time, we picked up Isaac at school and took him over to OT.  He usually is a little more distracted when I'm there, because I don't get to go very often [cue the working mother guilt].  So he was a bit oppositional at the beginning, but then mellowed a bit and showed us how he's learned to jump with both feet, do an obstacle course, cut with scissors, swing a little on the trapeze.  It's all so simple and elemental, but I felt myself cheering him on like it was the Olympics. [One of the unexpected gifts of this experience: it really makes you appreciate the little victories.]\n\n***\n\nAt dinner last night, J., my dad and I were doing a little reminiscing, and J. recalled the time we went to visit my then 96, 97 or 98 year-old great aunt Grace (birth records not being very reliable in those days) in her apartment in Brooklyn. J. was in the early throes of a nasty flu, and, sick as he was, he braved the experience like a trouper.  At the time, she was still living on her own with the assistance of a part-time aide, and she received us into her apartment with all the old-world rules still intact. \"You'll have some cake,\" she commanded my poor, bilious then-boyfriend the second he crossed the threshold. \"Thanks, Aunt Grace, but I'm feeling a little under the weather.\"  She didn't miss a beat.  \"You'll have some ice cream.\"  After more than 80 years in this country, her thick Romanian accent was still largely untouched. \n\nJ.'s impression of Grace sounded a lot more like Patty and Selma Bouvier [Marge Simpson's chainsmoking sisters, for you non Simpsons fans] than my aunt, but we all laughed anyway.  And then Isaac, who had been sitting quietly in Jesse's lap, piped up in his best gravelly monster voice, \"You'll have some cake!\"  And we all broke up.  And then, the magical bit: he looked around the table at each of us, and when he was satisfied that all of us were laughing at his joke, he just...beamed.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/06/i-took-the-day-.html", "title": "You'll Have Some Cake!"},

All sorts of things happening, can't figure out what to say about it, want to be cogent and offer perspective, but it's not always easy from the eye of the storm. And it's been a little stormy around here lately.  As usual (and we are lucky for this), a lot of happy and harder stuff all mooshed up together.  On the good side: after many stops and starts, Isaac is now quite close to functionally potty trained.  It's really adorable to see how proud he is, too.  (In deference to his dignity, I'll spare you the earthier and cuter details).  Today, he actually let the doctor examine him--imagine that.  And he's learned how to use the computer mouse, which is probably a mixed blessing, but for hand-eye coordination you can't beat it. And the lullaby thing is going well, which has made bedtime a little easier.  But boy, the moods on that kid.  He is really resistant to therapy lately, and we can't figure out whether it's him...or the therapy.  And did I mention the tantrums?  Every. Little. Thing. In deference to my better nature, I am trying to convince myself (and J.) that it's just four-year-old stuff, and stop with the is-it-or-isn't-it game that we used to play so relentlessly.  Is it a typical kid tantrum, or an autistic spectrum tantrum?  Try saying that three times fast.\n\nMy big revelation of the past week:  we are in a new phase.  We are past the initial shock, past the initial crisis period, and well into daily life, with all its bruises and little victories.  But sometimes it all comes rushing in, and it's hard to sort out how and what to feel.  And that's the eternal kicker, isn't it?  What is his, and what is ours, and where it goes, and what it means.  My short-term plan for this, all kidding aside, is to organize my closets and maybe even have a garage sale.  It won't answer any of my questions, but sorting something out, however trivial, always makes me feel better.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/06/this-past-week-.html", "title": "Another Post About Searching for Perspective"},

{"date": "May 06, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tI have a confession to make: we've never thrown a birthday party for Isaac.  Oh, we had a family gathering in New York for his first, including the traditional taste of chocolate cake (he was not a fan, and I briefly wondered if somehow I'd been raising the wrong child).  But a proper birthday party, with kids, and screaming and presents and goody bags? Not that. Not yet.\n\nIt was between his first and second birthdays that the tornado hit--the not talking, the stimming, the missed developmental milestones.  At night, I would curl up under the covers with What to Expect: The Toddler Years and read obsessively through the development charts, willing the columns to shift so that Isaac's spotty progress would seem less frightening.  And then I'd put down the book and we'd have The Conversation: \"Do you think it's more than a speech delay?  You didn't speak in sentences until you were three.  My cousins didn't speak until they were almost four.  There's no way--he's too social/connected/happy/whatever.  Do you think he is?\" And on and on, over and over, for months.\n\nIsaac started preschool in September 2005.  Not long after, the birthday parties began.  I remember carrying him several blocks and up a hill to a local park one hot spring day, but he started screaming as soon as he saw the billowing shape of the bouncy house and heard its motorized growl.  He screamed at volume for a good 15 minutes until I concluded that he wasn't going to stop, and so I made our apologies, left our gift, and lugged him back down the hill, sweaty and humiliated, to the car.  (Ironically, the next party was in the same spot, complete with bounce house.  We managed to stay a little longer that time.)\n\nSo the birthday thing: it's been a sore spot.  But Isaac is going to be four this summer and I just can't imagine allowing my boy to have a childhood without birthday parties.  So we're going to try it this year, in sort of a laissez-faire kind of way.  We'll invite kids from his school, our friends with kids, and we'll do it at the playground, sans bouncy house.  And if he refuses the cake, or ignores the other kids, or spends the whole time on the swings, we'll just have to deal.  As he often does,  he'll tell us what he needs, and as we often do, we'll find a rhythm, improvising with what we have, until the next time.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/05/the_party_perpl.html", "title": "The Party Perplex"},
{"date": "May 10, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\t Several weeks ago, Jesse and I were scanning the paper in anticipation of an afternoon out, just the two of us.  We thought we'd go see a movie, so I looked through the recent listings.  \"Look,\" I said, \"the new Anthony Minghella movie. It's about...\" and my voice trailed off as I got to the part about Robin Wright Penn and her \"13-year-old autistic daughter, an aspiring gymnast.\"  Not exactly the escapism we were looking for.  But the truth is, I am oddly drawn to movies about, or featuring kids with, autism.  I want to see what it's like for other people, even if those people are totally fictional.  I want to know if we're past the Rain Man era, or if people still expect our kids to have photographic memories and run around saying \"Ten minutes to Wapner\" all the time.  I want some perspective.  Needless to say, we chose another movie that day, and isn't it ironic that I can remember the one we didn't go to, but not the one we did?\n\nSo it was with some trepidation that I sent the boys out for a walk last Saturday morning and watched After Thomas on BBC America.  If you haven't heard of it, it's a British film about a child with autism who undergoes a remarkable transformation when he receives a pet dog, and it's supposed to be a true story.  I'd seen a couple of reviews that said it was actually quite realistic and good, which I took with a grain of salt, not knowing if the reviewers would actually have any idea of what a real child with autism might look like.  \n\nBut I have to tell you--the first part was scarily on target.  It begins as the mother is taking her perhaps four-year-old son for a new pair of shoes.  He screams through the whole proceeding, kicks the salesgirl repeatedly, provokes judgmental stares from the other mothers, and finally goes rigid and drops to the ground in the middle of a busy street.  Been there, done that.   Then once they get home, he kicks a closet door shut, accidentally locking his mother inside.  I could feel her terror as she calls to him to open the door, knowing that he probably won't, and imagines what he may be up to while she's stuck inside.  It was horrible, and very, very realistic.\n\nThere were other sensitively-handled parts as well: the strain on the parents, individually and collectively.  The guilt and fatigue.  The constant struggle with how much to push the child.  Dealing with the feelings, and opinions, and sometimes harsh judgments, of others.  But there are two main problems with films that depict autism.  One is that there is no sense of elapsed time, so we don't know whether this child Kyle began to communicate weeks, or months, or even years after the introduction of the dog.  We don't know how long it took for him to draw his first picture or interact meaningfully with his parents.  The nature of film means that the action has to be telescoped.  And let's face it: nobody wants to see a six-month-long film, no matter how touching, about a child who finally learns to try on a pair of shoes.  So events have to be compressed for dramatic effect.  Fair enough.\n\nThe other problem is that, when a child does something remarkable (in this case, says \"Kyle loves Mummy,\" at the end), you have no way of knowing whether this actually happened, or was created for dramatic effect.  Did the boy really say it spontaneously?  Was it echolalic?  Was it learned by rote?  So as a parent, there's no way to pick apart the story to see what, as parents, we might learn.  Should we all run out and get a dog?  If we have a dog, should we add him to the list of therapists?  Oh, and one more thing.  Drama being what it is, there's a real pressure to make the first part as wrenching as possible, so that the eventual transformation has the maximum impact.  But our experience is that the pain and pleasure are mixed, in varying strengths, pretty much every day.\n\nI suppose if I have any grand conclusion about this film, it's that the first half would make an excellent training film for anyone who doesn't understand the experience of raising a child on the spectrum.  And the second half was, well, heartwarming, but it reminded me again of the million unique circumstances and characteristics of each child, and how hard it is to universalize from that.  So where do we go from here?  I'll keep watching, thinking about this stuff, hoping to learn something, sharing what we're doing, and if we're lucky, something somewhere will ring a bell.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/223/index.jsp"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/05/several_weeks_a.html", "title": "Autism on Film: After Thomas"},
{"date": "May 16, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tWhenever I meet the parent of another child with special needs, particularly one with sensory, social or speech issues, I always feel an intense curiosity.  How do you talk about your child's challenges? When did you know he was different?  What is he like at home/at school/with you/with other kids?  How does he manage in supermarkets and parties and cars and restaurants and school and planes and barbershops?  How do you communicate?  Does he sleep? What does he struggle with and what obstacles has he overcome?  It's a limitless sea of questions that, owing to common decency, respect for privacy and good old-fashioned social convention, can't just be gushed out at will.  \n\nPat of this is magical thinking--the idea that by talking about this whole \"special needs\" business, we can somehow make it all make sense.  This was especially potent during the \"is he or isn't he\" early days, when we so desperately believed that if we only understood things better we would be able to see that faint line in the sand, and know where we were in relation to it.  You know, the subtle difference (or is it a giant sucking void?) between \"just taking his time\" and \"you-know-what, not otherwise specified.\"\n\nIn my more self-critical (or possibly self-aware) moments, I wonder if this curiosity is just another way of asking the universe for a glimpse of what will happen in the future.  Will he be happy?  Will he have friends?  (Cue Doris Day singing \"Que Sera, Sera.\"  You get special bonus points if you can name that film: one of our favorites.)\n\nBut let me take a step back and tell you what I believe.  I believe that we are in such an early stage of learning about this stuff that we have no language or perspective yet.  I believe that we are standing so close to this painting that we can't see how the individual brush strokes relate to each other, much less what it looks like or could possibly mean.  I believe that, until we have a more precise way to pinpoint and talk about our children's challenges, we will remain in the dark.  \n\nI also believe that we on the front lines -- parents and teachers and therapists who see, work with and love our kids every day -- are the greatest resource available to figure this whole thing out.  So, in the interest of not being a pest, I do try to control myself, but I still ask questions.  And I hope that by talking to each other and remaining open and curious, we will start to see the patterns, and how they relate to each other, and, bit by bit, find a way to better understand and help our kids.\n\nUpdate: Kristen at From Here to There and Back posted a lovely companion piece to this post earlier today about a related question: \"How do I talk about my son\u2019s challenges\u2014with my son?\"  I hope you'll read it and weigh in with your thoughts.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://fromherethereandback.blogspot.com/", "http://fromherethereandback.blogspot.com/2007/05/talk-to-me.html"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/05/crystal_ball_ba.html", "title": "Crystal Ball, Batteries Not Included"},

She was born in January 1930, just a few months after the stock market crash of 1929 signaled the beginning of The Great Depression. She was my grandparents' first, and, as hard as it is to admit, initially a great disappointment to my grandfather, who desperately wanted a boy.  I can only imagine how terrifying it must have been to have a newborn during those uncertain years.\n\nShe grew up in Michigan, and later on the Upper West Side of New York, an area immortalized by Woody Allen and now nearly indistinguishable from the rest of the country, dominated as it is by Starbucks, Gap, Victoria's Secret and families pushing $800 strollers.  Back then it was a middle-class, mostly Jewish neighborhood, where she led a fairly sheltered life.  The family lived right across the street from the Riverside Memorial Chapel, a funeral home, and when guests dropped by the apartment unexpectedly, my grandmother would open the door with a resigned \"Who died?\" \n\nMy mom married early, and, when that marriage ended in divorce (a \"shanda,\" or terrible shame in Yiddish), she met and married my father, handsome, funny and fresh from his own divorce.  They were both approaching advanced old age for newlyweds: he was 30, she was 29.  She was thrilled and terrified when I was born.  My father tells me that, just a few days after they brought me home from the hospital, she called him in tears, demanding that he come home immediately to help her bathe me, or he would be father to \"the dirtiest child in all of New York.\"\n\nMy mom was a brilliant pianist.  She could hear a song once and play it perfectly, and when we had musicians in the house (a fairly common occurrence in my childhood), I could always tell the tone of her playing from anyone else's.  She loved Cole Porter and Harold Arlen, but her heart belonged to Gershwin. In her late 30s she began composing songs, and even had some successes.  (One song, in a completely bizarre twist of fate, was sampled by Diddy on his 1997 song \"It's All About the Benjamins\").\n\nMy parents separated when I was 16, and painfully divorced over the next several years.  It was a dark time, and her sharp sense of humor gave way to depression.  She would often get together with her other women friends, and they would drink, and talk, and smoke, and listen to music, and complain about men, long into the night.  Over the next few years she managed to put her life back together: she sold our family home, bought a condo and started a new career--her first since college.  She began dating, and though Sundays were always melancholy for her--family days--things were looking up.\n\nAnd then she got sick, and when I was 29, after a long and painful battle, we lost her.  \n\nMy mother was not a Hallmark card mother.  She didn't really play with us, preferring to send my sister and me to fend for ourselves.  Her sense of boundaries and discipline was haphazard.  She was more inclined to treat us like adults than kids, which was confusing when we were small and lots of fun as we got older.  Though she was a great cook when she felt like it, she tended to exhaust herself on the occasional elaborate meal and then shout \"find something in the freezer\" from the bathtub for the rest of the week.  When I was a teenager and my friends came over, she'd sit cross-legged on the floor with us and talk for hours--mortifying to me, but earning her the reputation in the neighborhood as the coolest mom ever.  She had style, and wit, and talent, and she loved us fiercely.\n\nMy mom never met Jesse, never saw me married, never saw Isaac.  I don't know if she had ever even heard of autism, and I have no idea what she'd think of my life today.  But, now that I'm a mother, I find myself appreciating more and more the multiple, fragile elements that make up my memories of her: generous, mercurial, sometime bitter, always loyal to her family, always looking for love.\n\nHappy Mother's Day, mom.  \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/05/a_few_words_in_.html", "title": "A few words in honor of Mother's Day"},

Usually Beata takes Isaac to school, but today she had an appointment so I called in to work and said I'd be late so I could take him.  \n\nNo problem, right?  After all, I take him to his other school twice a week, and he usually scoots in with a wave and a jaunty \"Bye, Mommy!\" \n\nWhat was I thinking?\n\nWe got out of the car this morning and he. Just. Lost. It.  Screaming, crying, kicking, tearful pleas to get on at least five buses, go get pizza, take a walk, go home and take a nap, go up the hill, watch Sesame Street, and on, and on, and on.  People stopped, offered us help, said a few kind words to Isaac, and finally smiled ruefully, shrugged and walked away.  At one point he agreed to let me carry him up the hill (remember?  51 lbs at last count) and we made it as far as the front door to the building, where he fell apart again.  We spent another good half hour there with his teacher and classroom aide.  Then, unnacountably, he decided he wanted to go through to the yard, and we followed him gratefully, relieved that our long national nightmare was finally over.  \n\nSilly me.  Turns out he knew there was a gate that leads back outside to the front of the building.  Luckily, the gate was locked, but he demanded we open it.  Finally I told him I couldn't because, sorry, I didn't have the key.  \"I want the keyyyyy,\" he wailed, and frantically began searching my pockets.  \"Isaac,\" I said calmly, \"I don't have the key.\"  \n\nHe stopped, spun around and bellowed: \"WHERE IS IT?!\"  \n\nHis teacher and I looked at each other, dumbfounded.  \"I've never heard that before,\" she whispered to me.  \"Yeah,\" I whispered back.  \"It's only his second question.\"\n \nIt took an hour and forty minutes to get him settled.  I got to work horribly late, sweaty, exhausted and visibly weepy.  But he asked a question.  Another question.\n\nThis is what progress looks like.

Just sucks you down into alternate realities and a whole lot of very destabilizing \"what if\" scenarios.  (Raise your hand if you are thinking, \"Susan, step away from the Internet!\") But stay with me a moment.  Did you know that the Autism Society of America lists 17 different therapies in three categories?  All the common ones are there: ABA, Floortime, OT, ST, RDI and more, plus the biomedical interventions and the complementary ones such as music, art and animal therapies--including swimming with dolphins.  In the spirit of full disclosure, we've actually heard good things about a music therapist in our area, but the truth is that we're overscheduled as it is, so it would start the whole spin cycle of \"what do we cut, how do we fit it in, can we afford it\" (that would be a no), and on and on.  \n\nDon't get me wrong--I've seen enough by now to know that choice of therapies is one of those polarizing topics that can lead to hurt feelings and raised voices and a whole lot of unpleasantness all around.  So I don't go there.  But today's experience brought back the very same rush of panic I felt on that first day in the developmental pediatrician's office, when the floor opened up and sucked us into a future we were never expecting.  \"Are these the right things?  Should we do more?  What about...? What if...?\"  The doctor scribbled a few names on a yellow legal pad and wordlessly handed them to us.  We made some phone calls and some judgment calls and then some more phone calls, and things started to happen.  Ok, good.\n\nBut I hope that someday soon the parents who perch anxiously on the scuffed brown couch as they watch their future take a hard left turn have an easier time than we did.  I hope that as they face their news they are greeted with better, more precise information, so they can make choices that they believe in and that will help them feel like they're doing the right things for their child.  I can tell you that it's gotten better for us since that day.  We are learning more all the time, from stumbles as well as successes, and we generally feel more confident that we're on the right path.

{"date": "May 27, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tIsaac has discovered the kaleidoscope.  No surprise, really, that he'd love it, turning it this way and that to see how the light and the shapes change.  It's fundamentally appealing, this idea that if we shift our view just the tiniest bit, we can see something different and unexpected.  Daily life works kind of the same way.  Isaac is a different kid at school versus at home, at the grocery store and around town versus new environments.  At home he's generally sunny, more verbal, open and engaged, while at school he can be quieter, more withdrawn, harder to reach.  Out in the world, he tends to be curious and energetic and generally excited to see new things among the familiar (a ferry! a fountain! a bridge! a tunnel!) A little shift in scene, a big shift in mood, a different boy.\n\nThis afternoon, at his request, I took Isaac across a bridge, through a tunnel and to a small town a few miles north.  I had had visions of a companionable afternoon spent meandering among the tourists, stopping for a slice of pizza and an ice-cream, throwing a few pennies in a fountain together before getting back in the car, back through the tunnel, back over the bridge, back home to Daddy.  Not quite. \n\nNow for the pop quiz: \n\nIn retrospect, I should have:\na) planned this outing for the morning, when he'd be fresher\nb) given him lunch first and foregone the pizza idea, lovely though it was\nc) gone to the ATM BEFORE we left the city (the reason for this will become clearer in a moment)\nd) stopped with the expectations already\ne) a, c and d\nf) all of the above\n\nThe correct answer is either \"E\" or \"F\", depending on your particular pain threshold.  Here's what happened:\n\nMuch enjoyment at the crossing of the bridge, followed by delight at the tunnel, followed first by mild-moving-to-extreme disagreement about stopping and parking the car, followed by lengthy full-scale meltdown, falling to the sidewalk screaming (I couldn't bear to raise my eyes to see if we were attracting compassionate or judgmental stares--or both), followed by brief respite involving eight pennies and one fountain, followed by slight improvement upon news that a bagel might be imminent, followed by extreme disappointment that trip to ATM preceded bagel, followed by agreement that slice of pizza would be better than bagel, followed by loud disagreement about washing hands in narrow eight-table pizza cafe (to kind and knowing looks by proprietors), followed by immediate satisfaction and calm upon receiving first a glass of milk, then a slice of pizza (thoughtfully cut up into child-sized pieces), followed by smiles and sweetness and quiet munching.\n\nAs Isaac was closing in on the last few bites of pizza, an older English couple came in and sat across from us.  I caught the woman's eye and said, \"Believe it or not, he was a screaming maniac about a half-hour ago.\"  She smiled gently. \"That's funny, I was just thinking what a well-behaved little angel he was.\"  I thanked her, and we left.  On the way back, Isaac asked if we could go into a toy store, where he picked out a replica cable-car as a souvenir.  He held my hand peacefully as we walked back to the car.  \n\nNow, for extra credit: was it spectrum-based rigidity? Simple hunger?  A combination?  To find the answer, I guess we need to take a deep breath, shift the kaleidoscope and try again.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/05/isaac_has_disco.html", "title": "A Tiny Trick of the Light"},

{"date": "May 17, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tPart of the reason I started this blog is that every time I see a news story or TV segment on autism, everyone looks totally exhausted and miserable.  And believe me, I get it.  But there are these great moments too--ones that open up our sense of possibility--and they are as much a part of this experience as the harder stuff.  So, without further ado: three things that made me happy this week.\n\n1. I remember when I was trying (and failing, and failing some more) to get pregnant that, the more I thought about what it actually takes to conceive a child, the more unbelievable it seemed that any of us actually get born.  Don't laugh -- I was there and taking notes in high school health class.  Now, with the benefit of about two years of daily research into the subject, it strikes me as miraculous that any of us actually learn to talk.  So much so that when I got home last night and Isaac said, completely naturally, \"Mommy, I want to give you a big hug\" I nearly fell off my shoes.  \n\n*** \n\n2. My post yesterday got Kristen thinking, and she put up a great piece on her blog, sort of in response, and it's started a neat little conversation about how we talk about our kids' differences.  Ten years ago, we never would have met.  We're in different parts of the country, we know no one in common.  But here we are, a few months into this blogging experiment, and we're sharing stories and making friends.  How great is that?  \n\n***\n3. We have recently hit a couple of new developmental milestones.  One is...arguing.  Isaac is absolutely in love with cell phones.  I am not a big fan of this for many obvious reasons, but it's hard to keep them totally out of sight.  Last night, Jesse was plugging his phone in to recharge, and Isaac grabbed it.  Jesse playfully asked, \"Isaac, is that your phone? Nooooo, it's Daddy's phone.\"  Isaac's immediate answer: \"I want it to be Isaac's phone.\"  Alrighty then.  This little exchange is so mundane as to be unworthy of comment for most kids.  For us, it was more than enough reason to dance around the kitchen in our jammies.  \n\nAnd now for milestone number two: whining.  I must say, it is hecka annoying to hear: \"I waaaannnt cheeeeeeese crackers\" at full volume first thing in the morning.  At the same time, it is pretty great to watch my little guy use everything he's got to get what he wants.  Externally, I try to remain good-Mommy calm, rational and unmoved by the whining.  Privately, I can't help but think, \"Go Isaac! Go! Go!\" (In case you're wondering, this morning it was Isaac-6, Mommy-0, but Daddy and I made up some points later in the game.)\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://fromherethereandback.blogspot.com/2007/05/talk-to-me.html"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/05/i_remember_when.html", "title": "Three Lovely Things"},

{"date": "June 01, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tOne of the most disorienting aspects of this whole journey is that there is no map, no compass, no real plan and no last page we can sneak a peek at to see how it all turns out.  And yes, life is like that, but with typically-developing children there is an expectation of order--that things happen in some reasonably predictable way, that they make a certain kind of sense.  \n\nBut somehow we have landed in a different kind of storytelling.  On the way to work today, I was listening to an NPR segment on the return of Gabriel Garcia Marquez to his native Aracataca, Colombia, on the occasion of his 80th birthday.  (Aracataca is the inspiration for the fictional Macondo in One Hundred Years of Solitude, J.'s favorite book, which he has been urging me to read for all of the many years we've been together.  I still haven't managed to do it.  Why?  I don't know--maybe it's some weird superstition. But I digress.)\n\nSo I started thinking about reading--how I don't get the chance to do nearly enough of it these days, and how I have always loved unconventional storytelling, where dreams intrude on daily life, language is elastic, and the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur. While I think that predisposition has made it easier for me to understand Isaac, I admit I still long for more insight into what's on his mind. \n\nIn the past year, we've definitely gotten some indications of what he's thinking about; namely, food, milk, us, steam trains, tunnels and bridges, cars and trucks, numbers and letters, going to the ocean, taking a walk, snuggling, saying goodnight and, lately, chocolate.  True, all of this is concrete stuff, but I am happy to say that at nearly four, his language is almost always intentional and meaningful.  \n\nBut there is another dimension as well. As challenging as it can be sometimes for Isaac to sequence physical play, he loves to take words, twist them about, rhyme them, omit letters or even syllables, or add new prefixes or suffixes (he recently dubbed us \"Mommoon, Daddoon and Izoon\", which he found endlessly hilarious.)  So there we have joint attention, creativity, imagination, humor and, I think, an innate love of language.  \n\nFrom the beginning, well before Isaac had any words at all, both J. and I felt that we just...got him.  And the people who have had the most impact on him have always been those who understand and respect him, and who appreciate the personality beneath the (emerging) language.  And I am hopeful that, conventionally or not, Isaac will one day be able to begin to tell us his story, at his pace, in his words.  That will be the best story ever, the greatest gift, the sweetest prize.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Solitude-Gabriel-Garcia-Marquez/dp/0060929790"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/06/my_gut_is_my_co.html", "title": "Magic Realism"},
{"date": "May 27, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tBy Jordan Sadler, SLP\n\n\nSusan asked an excellent question of the Family Room contributors recently: How do we as therapists talk to parents about a child\u2019s prognosis?\n\nYes, parents do sometimes ask, \u201cWhat is my child\u2019s prognosis?\u201d and that is understandable.\u00a0 As a parent, I am sure I\u2019d be asking it myself.\u00a0 \u00a0However, it may be as difficult for therapists to answer as it is for parents to ask.\u00a0 For one thing, what do parents mean by \u201cprognosis\u201d?\u00a0 Does it simply mean, \u201cWhat will the outcome be for my child after all this therapy? What will his future look like?\u201d\u00a0 Or is it a way of asking, \u201cHow close to typical do you think my child will become?\u201d\u00a0 Although the latter is a perfectly fine (and understandable) goal for one\u2019s child, I always bear in mind just how broad the range of \u201ctypical\u201d really is; it\u2019s a moving target.\u00a0 Is your typical the same as my typical?\u00a0 Is \u201cquirky\u201d as okay with you as it is with me? I like to think more in terms of \u201cHow comfortably will this child be able to socialize, play, and learn with others?\u00a0 How can we help him be his best self and be happy with who he is throughout childhood and into adulthood?\u201d\n\nThe short answer is, we don\u2019t know. I always begin my answer to that question with the \u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball\u201d response.\u00a0 And I do wish I had a crystal ball. I wish I could look a parent in the eye and say with confidence, \u201cOh, your child will be just fine.\u00a0 Simply do x, y, and z!\u201d\u00a0 But I can\u2019t.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve occasionally started working with a child who appeared to have everything in place to succeed and yet the progress was slower than I expected.\u00a0 Conversely, there have been times when I doubted in my heart how far I could get with a child and then was happily surprised to see him gain new skills quickly.\u00a0 Without a doubt, I am better at predicting this than I was when I started out as a therapist; experience makes a tremendous difference.\u00a0 But I can still be surprised, because children with special needs are as unique as anyone else, and each has to follow his or her own developmental path.\u00a0 If only we had the map ahead of time!\n\nWhat I feel I can say with confidence is that I pay attention to a cluster of \u201cgood signs\u201d for a positive prognosis, which to me means that the child will have the best shot at growing to his or her fullest potential, no matter what the diagnosis is or how old the child is at the time. I\u2019m sure we all have different internal criteria to determine prognosis, depending on the way we look at and think about the children we serve.\u00a0 \n\nWhen a parent asks me, these are my top concerns:\n\n1)\u00a0 \u00a0 Involved caregivers.\u00a0 Now, hold on a minute!\u00a0 You do not have to quit your job, no matter what that mom told you in the waiting room at OT.\u00a0 But you do need to be very involved with your child\u2019s intervention program.\u00a0 You do need to make sure your child\u2019s IFSP or IEP has appropriate, attainable goals and addresses your concerns.\u00a0 You do need to know all of his therapists and what they are working on.\u00a0 You do need to hand pick your private therapists and be as involved in sessions as you possibly can be.\u00a0 Organize team meetings with therapists.\u00a0 Have regular communication with them.\u00a0 Ask lots of questions.\u00a0 And you need to know what you can work on at home \u2013 and do it!\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot of work, whether you are working outside the home or not.\n\n2)\u00a0 \u00a0 Quality therapists. Another key to a positive prognosis is going to be the quality of your child\u2019s intervention team rather than the quantity of therapists.\u00a0 You need to hear from the therapists on a regular basis; if you don\u2019t see the therapist every week, be sure you are getting notes or regular phone meetings to discuss how things are going.\u00a0 I\u2019d prefer to see a child working with just a couple of excellent therapists rather than running around to see many different people who are working on different goals in different ways.\u00a0 Because if your child is doing that, how on earth can you as a parent keep track of what each therapist is doing, and generalize the goals at home (see #1)?\u00a0 And also, isn\u2019t everyone stretched too thin?\u00a0 In the long run, who does that benefit?\n\n3)\u00a0 \u00a0 A developmental program.\u00a0 Yes, this is closely tied to #2, but cannot be stressed enough.\u00a0 If I see a child with a therapeutic program that is focused on teaching skills without foundational skills truly in place (e.g., joint attention, referencing, reciprocity, emotion-sharing, perspective-taking, strong non-verbal communication skills), I won\u2019t feel that the child has as good a prognosis.\u00a0 Perhaps he will succeed academically in school, at least up until 3rd or 4th grade, but not socially.\u00a0 And believe me, when it comes time for your grown-up child to get a job, it is not going to be those academic skills that pay off in an interview or help him keep the job.\u00a0 It is going to be his ability to interact with others and work as part of a team.\u00a0 Without an appropriate developmental program, his future success will be tremendously impacted.\n\n4)\u00a0 \u00a0 An integrated team.\u00a0 Your child\u2019s team, whether it is made up of public therapists, private therapists, or both, must communicate with each other.\u00a0 Team meetings are an excellent way to do this, although they can be very difficult for parents to coordinate.\u00a0 \u00a0I have seen many families in Chicago set up Yahoo! Groups for their child\u2019s team, and this has been an excellent forum for therapists and parents to communicate notes, reports, comments, and questions.\u00a0 These are private and you can have an email sent to you each time there is a new post; I highly recommend it.\u00a0 A coordinated team is a committed team.\u00a0 And a committed team is working hard on behalf of your child.\u00a0 Therefore, integration of services will naturally lead to improved prognosis.\n\nEvery child is different.\u00a0 But until someone hands me that crystal ball I\u2019ve been asking for, I\u2019m going to have to rely on these other factors.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.communicationtherapy.net/", "http://groups.yahoo.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/05/some_thoughts_o.html", "title": "Some Thoughts on Prognosis"},
{"date": "August 02, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tSo there we were, surfing the developmental wave, feeling kinda groovy, when all of a sudden some of the behaviors that had kind of disappeared for a while made their return: echoing, more perseveration, more shouting.  Whyohwhyohwhy? Isaac's teacher called the other day and asked whether anything had been different lately.  \"Well, not really,\" I answered, \"except that I went to Chicago for a few nights...\"  D'oh.  I guess my quickie social story routine didn't quite take, or it was possibly/maybe my absence that made him more than usually grumpy?  I missed him terribly, after all.\n\nBut to be honest, this little phase has been building a while.  Is it a growth spurt?  A developmental leap?  He doesn't seem ill.  No changes in diet, no changes in sleeping patterns.  So, excluding the impossible (alien invasion, possession) the remainder, however unsatisfactory, must be the truth.  S**T happens.  I hate this.  And I want it to stop.\n\nOkay, look.  I love Isaac's eccentricities.  I think his flapping (when excited) is cute.  And his use of language--\"I want need help,\" \"I want Mommy come to bed,\"--is endearing.  But I know that what's cute at four might no longer be cute at, say, seven.  Or fourteen.  And I hate that too.\n\nSo I hover between, as Kyra has so beautifully put it, acceptance and remediation.  But I don't like hovering.  I want to hunker.  I want to find a place and stick.  It's not going to happen--in fact, it's better that it doesn't happen.  But vibrating between all these possibilities and realities is, well, tiring.  \n\nPlan for the weekend: do something simple and satisfying.

{"date": "August 01, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tInterview with Fiona Zecca, Early Childhood Development and Behavioral SpecialistSo, yesterday we talked about setting up the initial playdate.  Can you elaborate on what we should look for in choosing a potential playdate partner?\nStart by picking a child your child is interested in. Your ultimate goal is to have your child interact with another child, so pick someone who motivates your child. If you are unsure of this and your child is in a school or child care program, ask his/her teachers. If your child hasn't had many opportunities to form interest in another child or simply is not interested in other children, pick a child that is easygoing and willing to go on a playdate. Pick someone that you know is a good match for your child's temperament and sensory system - someone who will not overwhelm them.  If your child is typically the leader, pick someone who can follow. Note that some kids that do not seem like they would be a good match sometimes bring out the most in each other. Probably it is most ideal to pick someone in your child's same age range.\n\nWhat should be the format for the playdate?  Where should you do it and for how long?\nTo start with I would have the playdate at your house, for no more than an hour, ideally once a week. Your child is going to be comfortable at his/her own home and this allows them to feel in control and possibly have the opportunity to show the other child some toys/activities that interest him/her. This is also beneficial for the partner because kids typically love going to someone else's house to check out their toys. Also, a park is the worst place to have a playdate because the children are not natually motivated to stay togetehr and play the same activity. You often will find one child on the swings, while the other child is going down the slide.\n\nHow do you choose the right activity?\nI recommend choosing an interactive, high-interest activity that you will lead with the two children, such as baking/decorating cookies. If possible, playfully guide the partner to involve your child by transferring any directive you might give to your child on to the partner to keep your child an active participant. For example, you might ask the play partner to be in charge of the M&Ms by having him ask your child how many he/she wants for each cookie and what colors. This way they are having constant interactions. Eventually you will fade out as the playdates progress and the children are able to interact without so much support. I would recommend doing the same high-interest activity each week to give your child the opportunity to practice his/her role and because most children love predictability and repetition.  Change the activity when it is clear they are bored and want a change. Other ideas might be: putting together a ginger bread house or painting a large cardboard box to make a train they can ride in together or an interactive structured game such as \"Don't Break the Ice\" or rocket stomper or large bubble wands or balloon pumps, etc. What you will choose will depend on your child's interests.  Just make sure it is motivating to both children, and, naturally interactive.\n\nSo how do you tell if it's not working?\nGive the partners at least four consistent times before giving up. Look for small amounts of progress. Certainly you should reevaluate if either child is having a horrible time, but be sure to not give up easily. Even if your child doesn't seem to be getting anything out of it, he/she may be getting more than you think. You may want to take some photos of the playdate in progress and post them on your refrigerator so your child can look at them during the rest of the week and anticipate the next playdate.  If you find you just can't bear leading the playdates, it is just not your thing or perhaps you are too emotionally involved, see if you can get someone else to do it, an aunt, your child's dad, a tutor, a social coach, perhaps an aide from your child's school who wants to earn some extra money. \n\nIf you would like to ask Fiona a question, leave a comment here or contact her directly at fiona [at] fionazecca [dot] com.

{"date": "August 08, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tEvery so often, something will happen--at school, therapy, wherever--that throws our whole vision of the world into question.  Sometimes it's a cool thing, like the other day when Isaac spontaneously said \"All three friends!\" during a session with his therapists (they nearly fell over), and, later, \"I want 10 friends!\"  Or he'll look impishly at me and announce, \"I want to pee on Daddy's hat!\"  So silly, so four years old, so not what I want him to be saying, especially in public (but so age-appropriate, for which I am PROFOUNDLY grateful.)  But then, for no reason we can see, he'll refuse to go into the bathroom at OT, or melt down at the drop of a hat (not Daddy's), or start turning in circles, or we'll get a message from school that he was running the perimeter of the room today and the dread...creeps...in.\n\nIt's lovely, this feeling of lightness when he's so connected and happy and silly.  But the \"symptomatic\" stuff still freaks us out, I admit.  I know, I know, he needs vestibular input and all that stuff.  We get it.  And we do what we can to give him the right \"sensory diet\" and guide him into a more regulated frame of mind.  But I wonder: Is it possible that we haven't fully accepted this diagnosis?  (We'd better have--I have a whole blog about it, for heaven's sake.)  \n\nWe were in the car the other day, and J. was telling me about a message from school that Isaac had been acting unusually disconnected, and out of the blue I said, \"I think we have PTSD.\"  By which I mean that the diagnosis was so traumatic that, whenever we see something that \"looks autistic,\" all those feelings of fear and worry and dread come rushing back.  And we have this this hair-trigger reaction to a behavior, or a look, or a word, and we go right back to the feeling of numb terror we had in the developmental pediatrician's office.  From my armchair, this looks a lot like post-traumatic stress.  \n\nHave you ever looked at skin under a microscope?  The smoothest, youngest skin baby skin, when magnified, looks like the surface of the moon, with huge craters and crevices and....yeecch.  It's like that in those moments: everything is magnified out of all proportion.\n\nSo if ASD is a spectrum disorder for the child, maybe it comes with the added bonus of a perspective disorder for the parent.  We have become so accustomed to looking at our children under a microscope that we are in danger of losing our own sense of proportion.  This blog, this community of us, is a place to try and get it back.   \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/08/every-so-often-.html", "title": "Normal, Whatever That Means"},

If so, our lives are pure poetry these days.  In my more disoriented moments, I find this thought mildly reassuring, even though I doubt that's what old Will had in mind as he was penning Tintern Abbey during that lazy summer back in 1798.   \n\n***\nOn the train to the city yesterday (grandparents generously having offered to watch the boy), J. and I did some recollecting ourselves, some talking each other off the ledge, some vague rationalizing, but we mostly just gazed out the window and read, save for the occasional \"He did great this morning.  Did you see how he...\"  And then our voices would trail off, and we'd read a few more pages as the landscape flew by.\n\nMany blocks, a triple-marked-down jacket (ah New York summer sales) and a rushed and mediocre pedicure later, I am feeling a little more myself.  Is it that sometimes I need to hit the pause button?  Is it the exertion of managing my feelings through every meal, moment, transition, wondering what's around the next corner?  Mostly Isaac has been terrific here--affectionate toward his grandparents, connected and happy--but the twice-yearly visits always feel momentous in some way, as if we need to demonstrate, in five short days, the arc of his progress and the gorgeous 45 degree trajectory of his future...so everyone else will be happy?  So they'll stop worrying?  So I can relax and feel like a good mommy?\n\nNo one is asking me to feel this way.  It's my own doing, and it feels somehow as traitorious as it is pointless and exhausting.  He is not a science experiment, after all, just my own sweet boy, who is who he is, who learns and grows and changes with each passing season.  So I need to, as a certain colleague of mine would say, put on my big-girl pants and deal.  Here it is for your reading pleasure--me dealing.\n\n***\nTomorrow we get on a plane and go home.  I'll share some of my newfound travel tips for those of you contemplating a plane ride anytime soon (#1: If you have a sound-sensitive and newly potty-trained child who has never been in an airplane bathroom, you might consider a pull-up for the ride.

I'm sure the whole cabin appreciated that memorable sight).\n\n***\nBut, back to the moment.  Dinner, which came from the farmer's market at the Rockefeller Preserve, is done, and the dishes are washed and put away.  Nonna is upstairs, Grandpa is on the couch, and Isaac is sitting on the floor with J, who is trying to tempt him with a variety of delicacies--blueberries, carrots, strawberries--to go with the ubiquitous crackers.  Then they get silly, J. suggesting a range of other options for the meal: crackers with hummus, with hair, with cars, with blocks, and Isaac starts to giggle. It is our own sort of tranquillity, made a little melancholy by the fact that we return home tomorrow.  And so we'll see what home, and daily life, and a new school year, will bring.\n\n***\nWhile with an eye made quiet by the power\nOf harmony, and the deep power of joy,\nWe see into the life of things.\n\n- William Wordsworth, \"Composed A Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey, On Revisiting The Banks Of The Wye During A Tour.

All hail the first day of school and the moodiness it brings.  Normally, we would try to plan this whole enterprise into the ground, but this year we procrastinated until the absolute last minute.  Just had a few quick conversations, sent him off to school, and whammo--he refuses to go in until one of his fave teachers comes out and leads him into the classroom.  A few hours later, home comes this exquisite piece of artwork.If you sort of squint, you can see that Isaac wrote his name on top, though the \"A\" and \"C\" sort of mush together at the end.  Yay for my boy.  The original is, naturally, on the fridge, in a place of honor.\n\nNormally I would refrain from pee humor (as you know, I am so very delicate) but this is one is worth it.  Beata, now back from Poland (for which I thank all the deities I am aware of) relayed this charming tale: the other day, Isaac was relieving himself when she noticed that his aim had been, shall we say, a little faulty.  So she pointed this out.  He paused, looked down, and uttered the following lovely sentence: \"Dammit, I missed!\"  \n\nAll good things, no?  And yet.  Tonight I picked up the boys at (or as it turned out, outside) a pizza restaurant.  Apparently there was a very friendly little girl at the next table who came over and wanted to talk to Isaac.  She tried twice, at which point Mr. Hard-to-Get stood up, walked out of the restaurant and refused to go back in.  When I got there, J, and he were standing outside, and J. looked a little deflated.

It gathers like a storm: the air turns heavy and wet, you feel the pressure build and build, and at some impossible-to-predict point the clouds open and all hell breaks loose.  Tonight's, I have to say with a measure of awe, was truly spectacular.  The contributing factors: a long, active day spent with family, lots of sun and swimming, unfamiliar surroundings, not much downtime, irregular meals.  The catalyst: bedtime, or rather, the difference of opinion about when it should occur (our proffered 8:30, rather than, say, the eventual, exhausted 12:45).  The last straw: refusal to allow any more Sesame Street.  The duration: really, really, really long. The volume?  Ask the neighbors.  I'm sure they're still up.\n\nSo here's my question, since we're on the subject of perspective lately.  Is a \"spectrum tantrum\" really any different, objectively speaking, from a typical kid tantrum?  There is the same yelling, insistence, screeching and tears, the same throwing of objects, the same wracking sobs that subside, eventually, eventually, into sleep.  Maybe they are identical, the only difference being that age and duration and frequency play a part in what's considered (here it comes again, that word) \"normal.\"  \n\nBut here's the difference for me.  I feel, and I hazard a guess that J. does too, that our tantrums come with subtitles.  We experience them firsthand, and we simultaneously watch them play in a film loop inside our heads (J.'s revelation tonight: \"Wow--his \"R\"s are really getting good!\"  Mine: pronouns generally still confused, mitigated somewhat by the gorgeous sentence \"Daddy, please move your hand!!!\"\n\nAnd then, when it finally, suddenly stops, come the sports highlights: \"Coach, what did you think of your team's performance in the first half?  What will you do to play better next time?\"  And the same dull interviews with the athletes, and the tallying up of runs, hits and errors, until the credits roll and we all, finally, fall into fitful sleep.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/08/consider-the-ta.html", "title": "Tantrum Redux"},

We go twice a year, so over time it has this oddly staccato effect of making me see him in six-month increments.  Last time, he was afraid to go down the twisty slide at the playground, preferring to watch his cousin bound up and rocket down, while Isaac contented himself with climbing to the top, then throwing a ball (or shoe or rock) down to see how fast it went--our little Galileo.  A few months later, he tried it himself, and now he's a pro.  \n\nThis time, he was focused on climbing.  We went to J's elementary school, clearly built before property values skyrocketed, so it has this enormous field, basketball court, hopscotch, foursquare (remember foursquare?)  and, now, a brand new climbing structure.  School hadn't started yet, so we pretty much had the place to ourselves.  It was so neat to see how focused and precise Isaac was about getting from point A to point B.  We also showed him hopscotch, which he can't quite do yet, preferring to jump from one number to the next.  Lateral jumping is a huge milestone, and the numbers were so motivating.

For a long time after the diagnosis, we lived in a sort of siege state: running from evaluation to evaluation, therapy to therapy, hoping for the magic sign (or someone) to tell us it was alll a big mistake; he's just a late talker, he's just shy, he's just on his own schedule.  \n\nIsaac is in many ways at the edge of the spectrum: he's become verbal, he's blessedly free of medical issues, he's social (with adults), and sometimes we even forget a little that he's different.  But if he's tired or ill, or going through a growth spurt, or in a new environment, or around other children, he can become very stimmy and remote, and it all comes rushing back: yes, he is a different kind of child.\n\nAt a certain point, we moved from the initial period of crisis into something new, something that felt a little different. Oh yes, I finally realized, this is autism.  This is your life on autism.  And that has brought a whole host of realizations along with it.  Sure, some things are better.  Isaac continues to learn and grow and surprise and delight us.  We're no longer obsessively over-analyzing everything he does.  We've moved into a state of acceptance, and of (generally) knowing how to deal.  But there are some other important realizations too.  A simple cold can throw us all into chaos.  I was starting to look, and feel, tired and haggard all the time.  We need to eat better, get more sleep, exercise and generally take better care of ourselves.  We need to find time to enjoy what we're doing, right here and right now.  We need to move past the siege state into something more manageable for the long term.  \n\nAnd that is the crux of it: learning how to live, really live, with an autism spectrum diagnosis.  Last week it included a trip to the steam trains for Isaac, a trip to the gym and record store for Daddy, and a cool new pair of jeans for Mommy.  This morning, J. will take Isaac to the local farmer's market, where he'll eat fresh peas right from the pod and demand a challah roll from his favorite bakery.  Tonight we have a babysitter and we're going to see the new Harry Potter movie and then have dinner together.  Oh, and actually talk.  To each other.  In about five minutes I'm going to do three sets each of sit-ups and push ups, and a few yoga stretches, to get my blood moving and welcome the day.  (How can I do this, you ask? Everyone else is still sleeping).  It's small, but it's progress, and that makes it feel huge.  \n\nTake care, my friends.

Players should tag 8 other people and notify them they have been tagged.\n\nAnd now the facts:\n\n1.  The sound of Garrison Keillor's voice sets my teeth on edge.  Nothing personal, Garrison, but I have to change the station whenever A Prairie Home Companion comes on the radio. \n\n2.  My parents were in the music business, so as a child I got to meet a lot of celebrities: Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Davy Jones (of Monkees fame), and Smokey Robinson, who came to dinner and chanted Buddhist prayers in our guest bathroom between courses, slightly freaking out my mother, who feared they might be ill.\n\n3.  I have published a few translations of poems and short stories from the Italian.\n\n3.  I really, really, wish I could sing. \n\n4. Vicki, this is for you: I do love to cook, but I don't have much time for it.  I subscribe to the \"use great ingredients and don't do much to them\" philosophy, which works pretty well in crunchy-organic Northern California.  I'm a horrible baker though, because I can't help experimenting.\n\n6.  I read every single book Agatha Christie ever wrote before I turned 18.\n\n7. I went to elementary school with Todd Haynes, who was my best friend in the 5th grade.  He was the first vegetarian I ever met, introduced me to the pomegranate, and cast me opposite him as Mrs. Keller in our 6th-grade production of \"Helen Keller.\"  His mom directed.\n\n8. I sort of have a periodic thing for video games, especially the ones where you have to shoot aliens.  And I love movies.  Love them.  Talky, emotional ones, ones where things explode, whatever.  But they have to be good on their own terms.\n\nNow I have something else to admit. Most of the people I thought to tag have been tagged already, so I'll tell you what: I'm planning to meet some new bloggers at BlogHer, so will introduce you to them after I get back.  Deal?\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://fromherethereandback.blogspot.com/", "http://jennifergrafgroneberg.wordpress.com/", "http://www.vickiforman.com", "http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/?refid=6", "http://jennifergrafgroneberg.wordpress.com/", "http://us.agathachristie.com/site/home/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001331/", "http://www.blogher.org/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/07/i-have-tag-guil.html", "title": "Of Pomegranates, The Monkees, and Large Explosions"},
{"date": "July 24, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tI am in the midst, (or maybe I should say mist?) of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  Don't worry, no spoilers here.  In fact, I've been fanatical about avoiding any Potter news or talk so I can have a pure and childlike experience with the book.  But the more I read (and this is true of all the Potter books, really) the more I wonder what \"childlike\" really means.  Does it mean wonder?  Newness?  Openness to the world?  There's a lot of pain in Potter, and, as I am quickly remembering, a lot of pain in childhood.\n\nI met a new friend this weekend, someone with a child similar to Isaac.  We discussed what happens when children realize that they are different, and what happens when the other kids realize it as well.  Given that Isaac is only four, we are still in the \"blissful ignorance\" phase.  The kids just don't notice yet--much, and I don't really know if Isaac does.  But I don't believe anymore that ignorance really is bliss.  It is worry, and concern, sometimes instructive, sometimes a waste of time.\n\nReading Potter this time is making me think a lot about Isaac's future.  Will he feel alone?  Will he find his strength?  Will his difference resolve itself into a happy and fulfilling life?  Will he discover his version of the Patronus charm when things are tough for him? As we sit on the bed and watch \"Do-Re-Mi\" from The Sound of Music for the eleventieth time, I think, sure, maybe.  As I try to show him how to learn to make words in Starfall, and he screams and drops to the floor in frustration, I think, I dunno, and I try something else.\n\nAnd, speaking of pain, he woke up the other morning and looked at me and said \"Tummy hurts.\"  It turned out he had a little upset stomach, and was soon fine, but I was struck by my (now familiar) dual reaction: 1) My sweet boy has a tummyache! and 2) He communicated pain verbally for the first time!!  This is something that is just so hard to understand if you don't have a special needs kid--the sense that everything your child does is happening in two places at once: the in-the-moment experience place, and the watching-it-from-the sidelines place.  And I can't even admit which of those thoughts entered my head first.  I'm really not sure.  And I wonder what that does to the experience of motherhood, in the end. Does it make it richer for him and us?  Does it steal something away?  I dunno.  What do you think?\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Deathly-Hallows-Book/dp/0545010225/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-4385328-9825506?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1185325223&sr=8-1", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music", "http://www.starfall.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/07/pottering-aroun.html", "title": "Pottering Around"},
{"date": "July 27, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tDrizzly morning.  Rolled out of bed after 4 1/2 hours of sleep, showered and ran down to the hotel lobby, where I met dozens of women waiting for the bus to the Navy Pier for the first day of Blogher 07.  Oddly, the sign said \"The Corporate Experience,\" but the crowd--in everything from tattoos and piercings to cardigans and kitten heels--or both--boarded anyway.  Hubbub in the bus, women's voices, excited chattering--reminded me of a long-ago bus ride up to summer camp, the only real difference being that I did not wear my hair in pigtails, I was not wearing stupid green shorts, and my name was not (as of yet anyway) pinned to my shirt.  \n\nWhat is the sound of 700 women bloggers?  Loud, I gotta tell you. Women have a LOT to say.  But it was so exciting.  Elisa, Lisa and Jory started off the day with a brief welcome, followed by a \"speed dating\" session in which I exchanged cards with probably two dozen women (It sort of felt like high school. Will anyone call?)  There were health bloggers, body image bloggers, business bloggers, parent (okay, \"mommy\") bloggers, old, young, everything in between. \n\nThe first session I attended was called \"The Life Stages of Online Communities\" and it focused on how to build a community, how to nurture it, and some wry thoughts from Aliza Sherman (aka Cybergrrl) on how to let go.  Great advice on how to maintain the trust of your community, and real-life examples of what happens when you do something that goes against the expectations you've set at the beginning: \"If you're going to monetize, say it up front.\"\n\nI was so impressed by Carol Lin, the former CNN anchor who left the network to care for her husband as he was dying of cancer.  She is starting a site for families of cancer patients, which sounds like it will be a terrific resource. \n\nAnd what happens when your community starts to take control?  It's tough, as a founder, to face, and tough to do the right thing for the sake of the group.  \"It'll never grow,\" Aliza said, \"if it's only you.  It may not be what you thought it was at the beginning, but it could be a powerful thing.  so let it go.\"\n\nGreat morning.  Gotta run and learn more.  \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogher.org/about-blogher-conferences-events", "http://blogher.org/node/936", "http://babyfruit.typepad.com/mediagirl/", "http://www.carollinreporting.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/07/sisters-are-doi.html", "title": "Blogher07 Day 1: Sisters Are Doing it For Themselves"},
{"date": "May 03, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tLately everything feels like it's colliding in some way.  I got a call from Isaac's school the other day that he was warm, inconsolable and...tugging his ears (yes, I have learned my lesson).  When I arrived, he looked up at me, face streaming with tears, and wailed \"I want to go HOOOOME!\"  I felt the tears well up myself, mostly out of love for him and also, I have to admit, out of delight at such a clear, communicative sentence.  Being naturally overanalytical AND the parent of a spectrum child is a dangerous combo--it's hard to take things as they come.  Should I become more wise or enlightened about this anytime soon, I'll let you know.\n\nIn other news, I now have a renewed appreciation of Sigmund Freud.  Isaac has lately taken to waking up in the middle of the night, coming into our room and announcing: \"I want Daddy to get out,\" whereupon he jumps into bed and tries to push my dear husband out of bed.  We are working on a game plan for this, but it's hard to be all Floortimey and supportive at three in the morning.  My suggestion: a 24-hour Floortime house call hotline.  There's a market out there, I know it.\n\nLast night, as I walked into the parking garage near my office, I saw a tall young guy wearing a white, floppy wig, black pants, and a black shirt.  Didn't think twice about it until I saw another guy, similarly dressed and wearing the same wig, as I pulled out of the driveway.  At that point, I couldn't resist, so I asked him what it was about.  He rolled his eyes. \"The museum is doing a special show, so we have to wear these,\" he muttered.  And as I turned the corner, it all came into focus: a whole reception line of identically dressed, multiethnic Andy Warhols, welcoming visitors into the museum.  I can only take that as a sign.  Of what, I don't exactly know, but it was a lovely sight. \n\nAs we were getting Isaac ready for bed last night, Jesse and I chatted about a media story that had caused a flurry of activity at work yesterday.  This was a brand-new word for Isaac, who tends to respond to new words much the way he does to matchbox cars: with a belly laugh, followed by intense exploration.  \"Me-dee--ahh,\" he repeated, grinning at us.  \"Yes, sweetie, 'media,'\" we answered, and continued our conversation.  And then, after another minute, he crawled up into my lap, looked into my eyes and announced: \"I want to say bye-bye to the media.\"  And so we did.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/05/lately_everythi.html", "title": "Life Imitates Life, Art Imitates Art"},
{"date": "May 01, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\t Last year, Diary of a Goldfish instituted Blogging Against Disablism Day, in which she invited bloggers to write about their experiences with disability, whether personal, as a parent or caregiver, or otherwise.  So it reminded me of a post I wrote for the Silicon Valley Moms blog a few months ago about the incredibly fuzzy line between neurotypical and atypical, between personality and pathology.  We live somewhere on that line...some days a little to the East, some days way out West.  Here it is, in honor of Blogging Against Disablism Day:\n\nBlessed Are the Cheesemakers\n Tony Attwood, an internationally-known expert on Asperger's Syndrome, is a smooth guy. He knows how to work a room--how to put 500 anxious mothers (mostly, let's be fair) at ease. He begins his talks with an anecdote about how, when he is lecturing around the world, he plays \"Spot the Aspie\"--looking for the most likely candidates among his audience. And how, when he's giving a talk in front of a group of software engineers, or mathematicians, say, he looks for the one person in the room who doesn't have Asperger's. (They call us \"neurotypicals,\" by the way, or \"NTs.\" Someone once told me that was the genesis of the name \"Windows NT\"--Windows so easy, even a neurotypical could use it. But that could be suburban legend. Let me know if you have verifiable info on this.)\n\nLiving here in Northern California, it's easy to understand why autism is considered a spectrum. This is a place where many of the diagnostic markers--social awkwardness, intense specialization, disinterest in or unusual patterns of communication--are, well, valued. In fact, there was an article in WIRED six years ago that speculated that the reason our autism rates are so high here is that we genetically select for each other. \n\nAs the wife of a man who keeps a running tally of the number of minutes he exercises each year and who multiplies large numbers in his head for fun, and the mother of a three-year-old, diagnosed on the spectrum, who likes counting by eleven and thinks that the height of hilarity is to recite Goodnight Moon by replacing the first letter of every word with the letter \"D\" (\"Din de dreat dreen droom...\"), I have a profound love and respect for what I can only think of as \"neurological diversity.\" \n\nWhere it will lead us, I don't know. But as I drove back to work a few months ago after yet another of my son's endless appointments, I heard a story on National Public Radio about a cheesemaker in Somerset, England, who decided to train a Webcam on a wheel of farmhouse cheddar--for an entire year, mind you--so interested parties could watch it ripen. I'm not sure if that's personality, pathology or simply brilliant marketing, and, to be quite honest, I'm not sure I care.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/", "http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2007/05/blogging-against-disablism-day-2007.html", "http://svmomblog.typepad.com/silicon_valley_moms_blog/", "http://www.tonyattwood.com.au/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger#Asperger.27s_Syndrome", "http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html", "http://www.cheddarvision.tv/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/05/may_1_blogging_.html", "title": "May 1: Blogging Against Disablism Day"},

{"date": "July 31, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tInterview with Fiona Zecca, Early Childhood Development and Behavioral SpecialistThe very thought of playdates strikes fear into the hearts of many parents of children on the autism spectrum.  Who should I ask?  Should I tell them about my child's challenges?  Should I choose a typically-developing child or one with similar challenges? Will it be awkward? Will it benefit my child? Will he or she participate?  Will the other parent agree?  And what do we do when we're there?  I asked Fiona Zecca to talk about the very first step: finding the right playdate partner for a child on the spectrum.  Here is her answer:\n\nI think it is probably more beneficial to match up with a typically developing kid for a playdate. The \"expert\" player is then able to more easily take some direction from you and keep the interactions going with your child. Of course you could have a playdate with two kids on the spectrum but probably the expectations would be very different--it would be more for exposure to peers and hopefully some interactions. I think the latter would be a lot of work for the mom/dad facilitating the playdate and bring on frustration, like \"what's the point of doing this?\"\n\nIn the past when I have helped organize playdates with some of my clients, the mom of the child on the spectrum has explained to the other mom that her child needs some practice socializing, that this is done best in a 1-on-1 playdate setting and she has been told by the child's teachers that these two kids seem to enjoy each other.  She could then suggest picking up the child up from school once a week and have him to their house for an hour. In other words, making sure that the family pursuing the playdate does as much of the work as possible (pick up, drop off, etc.) so that the play partner doesn't feel burdened and want to bail out. With this format it will be very clear whether the other parent is a good match or not. Either they will agree to participate--or not.\n\nAs far as matching up two compatible kids, you have to take a chance and try different partnerships. It will be kind of obvious whether it is a good match. If your child is not in distress and it seems that both children are enjoying the activity, it is a good match. If you are matching two spectrum kids together and it feels too intense and too much pressure for each child (and each parent), this is probably not a good match. Even if your child feels some anxiousness anticipating the upcoming playdate but then slowly progresses each week by participating more, or being more interested in the partner each week, this is success. Remember that typically it takes children time to get used to everything. The more you do the playdates, the more he/she will be able to predict the routine, etc. Stick with it, if possible. You know your child and how long it usually takes him/her to get used to a new situation, if he/she has exceeded this typical timeline, probably not a good match, try another partner.\n\nWe'll go into more depth on this topic tomorrow.  Stay tuned!\n\nIf you would like to ask Fiona a question, leave a comment here or contact her directly at fiona [at]fionazecca [dot] com.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/07/playdate-series.html", "title": "Playdate Series Part 1: Finding the Right Partner"},

The same thing is true of Ann Coulter.\"\n\nOn stating her views, even when they differ from the campaign's: \"No one's ever asked me to stop talking.\"\n\nOn Hillary Clinton and the Defense of Marriage Act: \"She's in favor of repealing some of it.  John and I are in favor of repealing all of it.\"\n\nOn universal healthcare: \"The national will is there.  But to pay for it we're going to have to raise taxes.\"\n\nOn Hillary Clinton: \"If you say as a woman you should support me, then you should lead on the issues that are important to women.\"\n\nOn youth involvement in politics and community work: \"I think one of the reasons young people are not involved is that they feel powerless, and that their voice will not be heard...I think it's part of the jobs of campaigns--wherever they are on the spectrum--to hand young people a megaphone.\"\n\nOn Iraq as a women's issue: \"Iraq is a women's issue...I bet in 2004 I did not have a single event where a woman didn't cry in my arms for the loss of their child, or in fear for their child.  I think if women were in charge there would be no more wars.\"  \n\nOn the politics of war: \"I was once at a fundraising event when the the audience was asked who among them had a relative who was serving in Iraq, and not one of the guests raised their hand--but all of the people who were serving raised their hands.\"\n\nOn the politics of media: \"John has said that he does not want Rupert Murdoch to be the gatekeeper of the information that Americans receive.\"\n\nMore on Rupert Murdoch: \"I don't agree with Rupert Murdoch.  I agree with me all the time.  But I still don't think I should be the sieve through which all information flows.\"\n\nOn where she gets her news: \"I turn on the BBC.  I don't want to hear 90 seconds on an issue.  I want to hear it fully discussed.\"\n\nOn self-expression: \"I think people dye their hair purple because they want to be noticed in a very crowded world.\"\n\nOn campaigning in Texas: \"I'd like John to go to Texas and campaign against Rudy Giuliani.\"\n\nOn how her faith informs her political views: \"I believe that we are given a set of guidelines and that we are obligated to live our lives with a view to those guidelines....not because of the promise of eternal life, but because it is right.\"\n\nAnyone want to join me in nominating Mrs. Edwards as a write-in candidate for 2008?\n\nPhoto courtesy of Stefania Pomponi Butler at Citymama.

{"date": "July 28, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tI'm live-blogging this session for the benefit of my mom-blog-writer friends who I KNOW have a book in them--you know who you are.  It's 10:15 on Saturday and I'm in a room with about 100 other women curious about how to turn their blogs into a book.  The panelists are Denise Wakeman, founding member of The Blog Squad, writer and editor Ariel Meadow Stallings, Lifehacker founder Gina Trapani and ICM literary agent Kate Lee. \n\nKate represents a number of bloggers--she started out as an assistant trying to find clients, and through them, her niche.  She began by contacting people she'd met online, and it spread virally at the beginning.  She's looking for voice--unique and compelling voice.  She's also looking for traffic, and, finally, ideas and concept--something fresh and new that hasn't been out there before.\n\nSo, how important is it to have a blog?  Kate says \"it's a no-brainer\"--for marketing and for connecting directly with your audience.  Most publishers want you to have a Web page so there are at least links to Amazon, B&N and Borders.\n\nAriel and Gina talked about how having a blog has helped them market their books.  Gina included the traffic stats, etc in the book proposal.  Lifehacker is a Gawker Media blog, so Gina had the ability to build traffic that way.  \"So I wasn't touched by God.  I was touched by Nick Denton.\"  She had a mention in the NYT the day her blog launched.  Ariel's personal blog is Electrolicious, which inspired her first book Offbeat Bride: Taffeta-Free Alternatives for Independent Brides.  \n\nAnother question: if your work is posted on a blog, is it considered previously published for the book trade?  No, but you might just run into a problem of whether there's new material that's not freely available online.   Gina said that she did run into that issue with her book--her publisher wanted exclusive content, so it was a \"delicate dance\" to work it all out.\n\nWhat about book tours?  Ariel calls it an \"ego-crumbling\" experience, since no one goes to a reading unless they already know who you are.  So she did many readings to eight people, \"seven of whom were my friends, and the other one was some homeless guy who just wandered in.\"  So Ariel ended up doing her readings...in bars.  Her advice? \"Have your antidepressants in your pocket.\"  \n\nTo find an agent:  go to Everyone Who's Anyone in Publishing.  And if there's a book you like, look at the acknowledgements--they always thank their literary agent.  Another bit of advice: find an inexperienced literary agent.  The experienced ones are good, sure, but the new ones NEED your book to make their own career.  And publishers love to publish experts.  But not just by friends: according to Kate Lee, \"You need to be an expert in the larger sphere...try to establish yourself elsewhere.\"\n\nFinal words from Ellen Gerstein, Director of Marketing at Wiley Press: \"Look at some publishing industry blogs.  There are some great agent blogs, some great puslisher blogs.\"  And \"break out of your echo chamber. Think really hard about how you're going to appeal to a broader audience.\" \n\nOh and you would expect that lifehacking goddess Gina would turn her personal experience into something practical we can all use: she wrote the definitive piece on turning your blog into a book.

{"date": "October 24, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tLast night, I sat in a tiny, packed theater filled with nervous, emotional parents of kids with autism, along with three of Isaac's therapists--a lovely surprise.  I don't think any of us knew what to expect, from the movie or ourselves.  I've been trying to collect my thoughts ever since.  In brief, the story goes like this:\n\nElaine Hall, adoptive mother of an autistic Russian boy, decides to re-enter the workforce and do what she loves and knows best: help children with autism express themselves.  She founds the Miracle Project, a program to engage with kids through drama, music and movement.  The film chronicles the development of a musical conceived and written by her and the kids, and follows them as they navigate through the process of interacting with each other, writing the musical and, ultimately, performing it in front of an audience of family and friends.\n\nWhat can I say?  It was one of the most moving, honest portrayals of the impact of autism that I've seen.  Each child and each family was finely drawn, and allowed to express the full range of their feelings: the fear, the guilt, the anger and resentment, the surreality of it, and ultimately the joy and love.  This wasn't Rocky: there were no easy answers, no shortcuts and no cheap moments.  And the emotional payoff of seeing all these kids do something creative together--some of whom barely spoke, some of whom had never had a friend before--it was just pure magic.\n\nThere were some unforgettable moments: one child talking to his mother about his desire to be mainstreamed, and his fear that he'll be bullied; Elaine Hall holding one boy's face in her hands as she cajoles him to look into her eyes (and he does it! and he smiles!); that same boy beaming as another boy tells him why he likes him; a 14-year-old girl, almost exclusively echolalic, singing with such lovely tone and expression. a tiny smile on her face; her mother's fear that her daughter will outlive her, and end up alone or institutionalized; Elaine's son Neal as he discovers how to express his feelings on the typewriter, giving Mom a run for her money...I can't even begin to express how much is packed into this tiny, extraordinary film.\n\nI came away loving each of these kids, and their families.  And I thank the filmmakers and Ms. Hall for showing what I want the world to see every day:  how special and beautiful our kids are, how hard they work, how far they can come with the right attention and a lot of love.\n\nIf you can get your hands on a copy, or find some way to see this film, don't miss it.  It's a thing of beauty.

I also can't help but perform an unconscious assessment.\u00a0 \u00a0I haven't heard him utter a word, but I've heard a few vocalizations.\u00a0 He claps his hands when the song says to, I note.\u00a0 He seeks out eye contact and returns my smile.\u00a0 He goes to his nanny for comfort when he needs it.\u00a0 Should I hand them a report when they leave?, I ask myself sarcastically, wishing I could just focus on the class. On occasion, Will runs from the group and does laps around the periphery of the room, looking at the place where the wall meets the floor out of the corner of his eye until his caregiver corrals him back.\u00a0 At least once during each class, a particular sound in a song becomes too painful for his over-sensitive auditory system and he screams.\u00a0 And cries. The intuitive music teacher switches to a lullaby in an effort to calm him.\u00a0 Sometimes he can be soothed but often his nanny carries him out, speaking kindly to the frightened little boy.\u00a0 She knows, I think.\u00a0 She understands this. \n\nThen there is Sam.\u00a0 He is 2 years old.\u00a0 He sort of manages in the \"gym\" part of Gym and Swim, but I notice him engaging in self-stimulatory behavior with the lights up on the ceiling.\u00a0 If left alone, he seems content but when another child comes close, he screams loudly and pushes the child away.\u00a0 When it's time to get into the pool, he sobs.\u00a0 It starts in the locker room and rises to a fevered pitch when he sees the pool.\u00a0 \"I don't understand why he doesn't like this,\" sighs his mother, holding his shaking body with her own feet dangling into the water.\u00a0 Clearly, she is the one who wants to be in the pool with the others, singing \"Five Little Ducks\".\u00a0 She wears an agonized, exhausted expression.\u00a0 She too leaves the class early, deflated.\u00a0 \u00a0I find it painful to watch.\u00a0 She doesn't know yet.\u00a0 She doesn't understand.\u00a0 \n\nI am not there as a therapist.\u00a0 I am there as a mother myself, attending classes with my own toddler.\u00a0 \u00a0Without fail, there is a child in each class we attend.\u00a0 A child who may or may not fall somewhere on the autism spectrum, but without a doubt has significant language and sensory needs.\u00a0 I do not doubt the new 1 in 150 estimate.\u00a0 Each time, I can't help but watch the child and his mother with both a therapist's and a mother's eyes.\u00a0 I want to reach out, say something.\u00a0 Something beyond, \"What a beautiful boy,\" or \"Wow, look at him climb!\", the words I find to point out all that is wonderful about their children.\u00a0 Especially to the ones I suspect don't understand yet.\u00a0 I find their confusion and pain unbearable.\u00a0 I have to forcibly tear my attention away to focus on my own child, who is so happy to have a special day with me when I'm not at work.\n\nI grapple with this question often:\u00a0 can I say something?\u00a0 If so, what?\u00a0 I believe that it would be in the child's best interest to let his parents know that there are other children who struggle with these things, that there are people who can help them.\u00a0 Especially when they could be getting early intervention.\u00a0 Especially when the child's mother looks so overwhelmed.\u00a0 And yet, when I am there as a fellow parent, dancing around the circle with my own child or negotiating over a toy, it doesn't feel right.\u00a0 I feel that it would be very intrusive.\u00a0 What is appropriate?\u00a0 \n\nWhat would that mother want to hear that wouldn't put her on the defensive or leave her feeling criticized?\u00a0 Or, if she is angry at me but weeks or months down the road does hear my words and pursues help for her child, is it worth it?\u00a0 \u00a0I welcome any experiences and insights readers want to share. \n\nTo reach Jordan directly, email: jordan [at] communicationtherapy [dot] net.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.communicationtherapy.net/", "http://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/health/feeds/hscout/2007/02/08/hscout601770.html", "http://www.communicationtherapy.net"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/02/through_a_thera.html", "title": "On Being a Mother with a Therapist's Eyes"},
{"date": "October 25, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tby Jordan Sadler, SLP\n\nJohn Elder Robison has just had a wonderful book published.\u00a0 Mr. Robison lives in western Massachusetts with his wife and teenage son; he runs a successful company, repairing and restoring fine European automobiles.\u00a0 Mr. Robison also happens to have Asperger's.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nFor much of the book, this is the way the story plays out - the fact that Mr. Robison has Asperger's takes a back seat to his fascinating life story.\u00a0 Despite many roadblocks - some of them enormous, such as his mother's mental health challenges and his father's alcoholism - \"Look Me in the Eye\" ultimately reads as a success story.\u00a0 \n\nMr. Robison was blessed with a very high level of intelligence, but what he makes clear in his book is that he was unhappy for many years.\u00a0 It was a long time before he found a job that fit his abilities, and his first marriage did not last. Asperger's was not an identified diagnosis when this author was a child, and\nnone of the professionals he worked with understood his unique set of\ncharacteristics. That is, until a close friend bravely handed him Tony Attwood's book, \"Asperger's Syndrome\" (the link is for the current edition of this book), noting that the characteristics outlined in the book fit Mr. Robison perfectly.\u00a0 At age forty, Mr. Robison agreed. \n\nThe author explains the enormous shift in his understanding of himself upon reading Mr. Attwood's book and the impact this had on his entire life.\u00a0 The last few chapters were particularly insightful, chronicling the years after diagnosis and the ways in which Mr. Robison processes thoughts and emotions.\n\nAs a therapist I found this book to be immensely interesting.\u00a0 It is a rare gift to hear from this fifty-year old man exactly what he wishes he'd known about himself as a child, how his logical brain works, and what kinds of skills he would have liked to have been taught.\u00a0 Here are some of the highlights:\n\nMaking eye contact with others has been difficult for him for most of his life and when he is looking at someone, he is \"unable to form words\".\u00a0 Later in life, he taught himself to glance at the eyes of a conversational partner to check in, but mainly looks away.\u00a0 This fundamental challenge led others to describe him as \"hiding something\", a \"criminal\", a \"sociopath\", and a \"psycho\", beginning at a young age.\u00a0 He states, \"I came to believe what people said about me, because so many said the same thing, and the realization that I was defective hurt.\u00a0 I became shyer, more withdrawn.\"\n\nThere is an account of a simple conversation with a good friend, in which the author details his internal dialogue and the difficulty he frequently has in knowing what the expected, socially appropriate response is.\u00a0 He notes, \"It's clear to me that regular people have conversational capabilities far beyond mine, and their responses often have nothing at all to do with logic.\u00a0 I suspect normal people are hardwired to develop the ability to read social cues in a way that I am not.\" \n\nThe author makes a fascinating argument that as he gained \"greater insight into [his] emotional life\", his logical thought processes took a nosedive; he states that when he looks at the complex electrical circuits he designed when he was younger, he is no longer able to understand them.\u00a0 I was glad to hear the author state clearly that he feels this was a worthwhile trade.\n\nMr. Robison makes it very clear that doctors who describe children with autism and Asperger's as \"preferring to play alone\" (which we hear all the time), are \"dead wrong\".\u00a0 He writes, \"I played by myself because I was a failure at playing with others. I was alone as a result of my own limitations, and being alone was one of the bitterest disappointments of my young life.\"\n\n\n\nThe author described the ways in which his wife helps him with his sensory processing challenges (e.g., sleeping \"in a pile\" with him, petting him when he gets jumpy), and how she deals with his anxieties.\u00a0 One of my favorite sections on his marriage was his extremely analytical dissection of choosing a mate; he wonders if he got the \"best sister\" (his wife has two sisters, or \"units\", as he calls them), and likens this to a man wondering for years after buying a new car if he chose the best model.\u00a0 Although he has heard the reactions of his neurotypical friends, he is unable to relate to their arguments because his mind works in such a strictly logical manner. \n\nThis book is a treasure for people with Asperger's as well as their families, friends, and the professionals who work with them, but it is also a very interesting book for anyone interested in human interaction and psychology.\u00a0 It deserves a special place on the bookshelf right next to Temple Grandin and Daniel Tammet.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.johnrobison.com", "http://www.amazon.com/Aspergers-Syndrome-GUIDE-PARENTS-PROFESSIONALS/dp/1853025771", "http://books.google.com/books?id=Fn-uAQAACAAJ&dq=Temple+Grandin&prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dtemple%2Bgrandin%26ie%3Dutf-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26aq%3Dt%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26client%3Dfirefox-a&sa=X&oi=print&ct=result&cd=2&cad=author-navigational", "http://books.google.com/books?id=gGrBCQYD3qEC&dq=Daniel+Tammet&prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Ddaniel%2Btammet%26ie%3Dutf-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26aq%3Dt%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26client%3Dfirefox-a&sa=X&oi=print&ct=result&cd=1&cad=author-navigational"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/10/book-review-loo.html", "title": "Book Review - Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's"},

Everything is muffled, slow and pressing in from all sides, and your lungs and head feel like they will explode.  \n\nGetting back in the car after the appointment is the worst--that heavy sense of dread and fatigue, each of you trying to look brave for the other.  Both of the developmental pediatricians we saw were in Marin County, so Jesse and I started a little ritual on the way back...a stop at In-N-Out Burger after each appointment, a grim treat.  Somehow it was always raining.\n\nPretty much everyone was helpful, intended to be helpful, or, in some less fortunate circumstances, was simply paid to appear helpful.  We were lucky enough to connect with some of the finest resources in the Bay Area, most of whom are shockingly busy.  Eventually we made our way through diagnoses, paperwork and all the usual mind-numbing processes required to identify, document and provide services for the special needs child.\n\nThe parent of a kid with special needs will quickly become intimately familiar with the official resources available to you.  In most cases, no matter how good these resources are, they won't be enough.  What Jesse and I really needed from day one was something to help us get from point \"A\" (the rainy parking lot of the developmental pediatrician's office) to point \"B\" (a plan for our kid).   Right now, there are few places in this country that do this well, or at all, so we're left having to piece it together ourselves.\n\nBut, during the course of the last two years, we found the most insight, reassurance and hope \"between the lines\": a playground conversation with a Dad of an older child with similar challenges, a late night email from one of Isaac's therapists, a new phrase learned and repeated with delight (Isaac is fond of saying \"Rock ON!\" lately), a suggestion from a therapist that you know can't possibly work, but somehow does. \n\nSo, I am planning to write about the things that work for us, that bring us insight and comfort, and I'm asking the people who have been most helpful to Isaac and us to share their experiences here.  My goal is to create two things: a unique, personal resource that talks about the experience of raising/working with a special needs kid; and a network that replicates in virtual space what we have developed over time in the real world.  \n\nI want this to be a place where people feel relaxed about coming by, kicking off their shoes, having a cup of tea or a glass of wine and much-needed conversation.

{"date": "February 13, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tWe went over to Marin and suffered through sessions with developmental pediatricians. Twice,\nactually: May and Nov. of 2005. We could see the whole rest of our lives laid\nout in front of us: some monotonous, gray, sad routine with all the color\nleached out, the way I imagine the Dust Belt in the depression.\n\nAll of this is natural and probably healthy. We\nneeded to feel shock and sadness and a million other things. But we also needed\nto take care of ourselves emotionally and financially and think intelligently\nabout our options. (All of this is far clearer in retrospect. I\u2019ve since become\nmuch more able to sign a paper with words or terms on it that upset me if it\u2019ll\nhelp Isaac and\nus get what we need.) I wish we\u2019d been\nable to feel what we felt and then separate it from what we\nneeded to do.\u00a0 \n\nWhat I wish we'd done:\n1. Realized that a diagnosis, especially at such a young age (Isaac was not\neven 2 at the time of the first session), does not guarantee anything\nand is essentially an interim progress report/guesstimate. It's current events, not prophecy.\n\n\n2. Realized that, whatever our feelings about our child's potential and\nabilities and progress, the label did not have to reduce him in our eyes\nto anything less than what he was. It could have, certainly.\u00a0 But\nthat was really up to us.\u00a0 The label did carry enormous potential to make\nour lives somewhat easier, at least financially.\n\n\n3. Found out, immediately, what our insurance would cover with an appropriate\ndiagnosis and what it wouldn't. Like casinos, insurance companies are not there\nfor your best interest. But if you learn the rules, you may be able to get some coverage.\nWhat minimum info needs to be on the submission to get it paid? What will and\nwon't they pay for?\u00a0 Will they reimburse speech? OT? An aide in the\nclassroom? Floortime?\n\n\n4. Where else can you get help? If your child is under 3, get in touch with\nyour regional center; you will need to suffer another developmental evaluation,\nwhich will probably feel like piling-on (our head evaluator sort-of-joked that\nour son met \u201conly five of the six criteria for autism, so he's almost\nthere\u201d\u2014hilarious) but which can help you learn to manage all this. Regional\ncenters can be great helps in providing support for services, classroom aides,\nand social support; in our experience, some of the people there were\nextraordinarily personable and helpful in guiding you through what can feel\noverwhelming. If your child is over 3, you will need to through this with the\nschool district. This can have its ups and downs, but it can be useful in\ngetting appropriate help. Isaac has really liked his district-provided school,\nand we\u2019ve been very happy with and touched by the commitment and skill shown by\nall of his teachers.\n\n\n\nI think that our biggest lapse was letting the\nparalysis get to our heads as well as our hearts. Emotionally, we were\ntraumatized, but we weren\u2019t going to make it any better by just feeling awful.\nSeeing what the right diagnostic codes could do for us, and what agencies could\ndo for us, meant a great deal in making our lives easier; it was our own form\nof magical thinking to assume that somehow writing some numbers down on a claim\nform or getting assistance from various organizations would mean writing them\ninto our vision of our child. That's just not the case. \n\n\n\nThe more you can remember that the world still\nworks the same way--trust yourself and your sense of your child; don't fall\ninto an emotional pit--the greater your chances of getting through the throes\nof we-just-got-diagnosis-X-and-omigod in one, or at least no more than a few,\npieces.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ggrc.org/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/02/what_i_wish_wed.html", "title": "What I wish we'd done"},

It's what Isaac was saying as he sat on the floor of his room this afternoon, leafing through some books.  Was it a script?  Did he make it up?  I don't know, but after a brief silence, he said: \n\n\"Once upon a time there was a bus.\"  \n\nTransportation?  Yup, that's pure Isaac.   I tried to get him to elaborate on the story, but he was pretty wiped out.  Another time.\n\nIt's been a rough week, for those of you following the Family Room dramedy. We're gearing up for a check in meeting with several of Isaac's teachers and therapists on Monday, and it always makes me tense.  Oh and thinking about the looming specter of what's next? Yeah, that too.\n\nTo take the edge off, we went to an open studio today.  Isaac rode on Jesse's shoulders as we explored room by room, examining the paintings, pottery, printmaking and various wares of a range of artists, all while pillaging their snacks.  I actually bought a painting, which was perhaps not the most practical or well-timed decision of my life, but it felt like the right thing to do, sort of a symbolic act.  It's by a local artist named Kirsten Tradowsky and she has a sort of contemplative, slightly moody style that really speaks to me.  And she paints children and school settings a lot.  That's the painting at the top--it's called \"Palace Theater.\"\n\nIsaac did pretty well, but tended to prefer the artists who had bowls of pretzels or Goldfish on offer--he' a discerning guy.  Later, we went for frozen yogurt, which he tasted, then refused, and sat with us until he became distracted by the design of the tiles on the counter.  At that point he seemed to think the best plan would be to sit down right in front to get a better view, and ended up lying on his back as people stepped around him, glancing dubiously at us.  I was trying a noninterventionist  approach (i.e., too lazy to get up), but it probably just made me look clueless and out of control.

{"date": "July 08, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tKristen's comment to my last post reminded me that, for a while now, I've wanted to write about expectations: you know, those critters that look cute and harmless, but can really turn nasty if you let them.  Last weekend we took our expectations to the zoo, where we left them, damp and crumpled, under a pile of elephant poo.  By which I mean that Isaac did NOT have a good time, whether because of the heat, a bout of four-year-old cussedness, or the buzz and unfamiliarity of the place.  Who knows?  And it doesn't really matter, because the \"big fun\" places (anyplace that costs more than $20 to get in and/or ends in \"land\") rarely work for us: too noisy, too loud, too much.  But we still find many, many ways to have fun.  But it's mostly when we don't plan; when we let serendipity take its course, and then, as it happens, fun finds us.\n\nThis afternoon I took Isaac to lunch at our very favorite pizza restaurant.  I called ahead and ordered a pie to go, and when we got there the place was jammed with 20-somethings, plus a crew of hipster parents enjoying a pie with their similarly hip-looking kids.  We stood in the cramped doorway listening to fairly loud hip-hop while we waited for our pie to finish baking.  And you know what?  I began to sway a bit, and Isaac swayed along with me, and  soon we were sort-of-dancing along to the music.  And then Isaac caught a glimpse of us in the mirror on the opposite wall, and turned and gave me a look of such delight and love that I vowed on the spot to exorcise those $#!@#% expectations forever.  I am not so delusional to think that's actually possible, but I try, my friends, I do try.\n\nFinally the pie was ready, and we took it, and a nice big cup of milk, outside.  We sat on the wooden bench and munched while we people-watched: a parade of dogs and their people, kids and their parents, and a glorious rainbow of haircuts, colors and tattoos on young and old alike.  It was our city, and it was heaven.\n\nLater, I dropped Isaac off with J. for a few hours and went in search of my long-lost mojo.  I treated myself to a frozen yogurt, a pedicure, a summery lip gloss and a pair of jeans, and, by the end of the afternoon, I am happy to say, I felt sort of like a girl again.  \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.pizzeriadelfina.com"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/07/kristens-commen.html", "title": "Serendipity and a Fine Pizza Pie"},

{"date": "October 01, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tMost everything I know about politics I learned from watching Jon Stewart and The West Wing.  I admit it, I'm not wonky that way, and the Sportscenteresque political coverage annoys me.  Who cares if more people approve of Mitt Romney today than yesterday?  And let's just say that I have a pretty good idea of how the sausage is made, and it's not pretty.  Policy changes follow polls, positions shift on a dime, mud is slung and re-slung, and I have as good an idea of who Angelina Jolie really is as I do the candidates (I take that back: I have to admire someone who tattoos the birthplaces of her children on her body.  Now that's commitment.)\n\nSo I was curious to meet Elizabeth Edwards at the BlogHer '07 conference in Chicago, and even more curious to meet her again with my fellow Silicon Valley Moms on Saturday.  She was warm, personable, genuine, and deeply thoughtful about things that I care about: education, health care, sure, but mostly: people.\n\nAs the parent of a child with special needs, I am intimately touched by all these issues.  Education, because my son's current program just...doesn't...work.  Don't get me wrong: the teachers are committed and talented, and they genuinely seem to care about my kid.  But school starts at 9:20 and ends at 12:20, so how exactly does that serve working parents?  We have found a temporary fix, but this isn't sustainable long-term, and I shudder to think about the families who just give up because it's too hard to make it work. Don't even get me started on the healthcare.  If you visit the Autism Society of America Web site, you'll find approximately 17 treatment options for autism, just about none of which are covered by health insurance.  With one in 150 children being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, this is a national crisis and a national shame.  So the political has gotten a lot more personal for me this time around.\n\nMeeting Elizabeth made me realize that if I vote for her husband, I have, for the very first time, a pretty good idea what I'm getting. And that made me rethink my assumptions about who and what I was really voting for.  It was a smart move to connect with the mom bloggers: we're not just out here writing about little so-and-so's stomach flu (though we do), or the great pedicure we got down the street (though we do)--we're having a national dialogue on raising and educating the next generation.  That is political, and the Edwards camp is listening.  (Hint to other candidates: are you listening too?)\n\nI admit I haven't done the research yet on the Edwards health care plan--too busy juggling day to day.  But I do know this: based on what I've seen of Elizabeth Edwards, I believe this campaign views policy in a complex and human way.  I appreciate that.  I respect that.  I may even vote for it.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-05/25/content_6149594.htm", "http://svmomblog.typepad.com/silicon_valley_moms_blog/2007/09/draft-president.html", "http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_treatment_home"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/10/most-everything.html", "title": "Rethinking My Vote"},

If you're a professional working with a child with special needs, I hope you understand.

I know, it's sweat and hard work and faith, every day, because evidence-based research is hard to come by, and this is all we have.

It started down, involving whining, hurling projectiles and spilling my water on the bed, and went up from there, thankfully.  I'm having a hard time telling whether this latest obstinate phase is his age, personality, or some spectrummy sort of thing.  Most likely, as everyone always reminds me, it's all bound up together and impossible to tease apart.  But I'm the sort who likes to know these things.  It's a failing, I realize.  \n\nLatest media craze: the Sesame Street episode in which Telly discovers a book about becoming a king, and Baby Bear helps him by making a crown, helping him find a throne, and becoming his special kingly helper.  Problem is, Telly becomes crazed by power, ordering everyone around terribly, until Baby Bear (who really is quite an extraordinarily generous friend) tells him he's no fun to play with anymore.  So Telly discovers empathy.  This has a certain resonance for me, and I'm not sure that Isaac's attraction to this episode is entirely a coincidence.  Oh and I think there's a lot our so-called foreign service could learn from watching an hour or two of Sesame Street.  Should be compulsory viewing for diplomats in training, don't you think?\n\nTonight, just before Isaac fell asleep, we snuggled in bed and sang what we've come to call \"The Alan Song,\" also from Sesame Street. It's about being proud of your name and who you are, and Isaac loves it.  It begins:\n\n\"My name's Alan, that's a fine name.  It's not your name, but it's fine just the same/Stand up tall and say it proudly/Alan is my name...\"\n\nIsaac added a few innovations of his own, to wit: \"My name's elevator,\" \"My name's basketball,\" and \"My name's In the Door.\"  And he grinned at Jesse, then at me, to make sure we got the joke.  To me, this is the paradox of special needs parenting: a little bit yin, a little bit yang, a little bitter, a little sweet, and always a tiny pocket of joy hiding somewhere you didn't expect it.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/10/you-know-who-wa.html", "title": "The Yin and the Yang"},

We might never do it again.  But we had to try.\n\nThe obvious questions: will he eat?  Sleep?  Freak out in a strange place?  Refuse to go anywhere?  And, just as importantly: will we?  Some of my friends said we were brave, in tones that made me think that \"brave\" was a compassionate way of saying \"totally out of your minds.\"  And I resolved not to overthink it, the way I always do.  (I was only partially successful.  Can you tell?)\n\nBut finally we went, and in the Maui airport, as we trekked by dozens of sunburned families, I thought: \"Wow.

We took him to Iao Valley State Park, where after an initial period of anxiety, he finally climbed the steps to the lookout point (check out the excellent windblown Elvis hair).  And we spent a lot of time in the pool and the ocean.  High point: Isaac spotting Jesse from the steps into the pool, and happily calling out: \"Hi Daddy!  I'm going down the steps!\"  Low point: Isaac melting down at full volume in a tiny chocolate shop in Paia.  \n\nAnd yes, he (mostly) slept and (sort of) ate, and there was at least one meltdown per day, and it all went too fast--every bit of it.\n\nWhen we left yesterday, Isaac said goodbye to our room, which he referred to throughout the trip by its number (\"Bye 496!\"), the fountain at the front, the tiki torches, the white rental car, the pool, the ocean.

Have fun with Beata!\"  or \"Have fun at school,\" and he repeats the same thing back.  In the language with which we've become all-too-familiar, it's called \"mitigated echolalia.\" He knows that comes next, much the way he always says \"So I can sit\" when I say \"Isaac, move over.\"  It's what's next.  It's what's expected.  But the other day, I said \"Isaac, you go to school and you play with Beata.  Mommy goes to work.\"  And, smart little business that he is, he tried it out the next day.  And it hung in the air for a moment, magically, before all the doubt and second-guessing started rushing in.\n\n(In the interest of full disclosure, today was another \"Have fun with Beata\" day.  Watch as I manage my feelings about this.)\n\nI know in my heart that through the echolalia and the non sequiturs he really loves me and wants to be with me.  I know it when I hear him come into our room at night, burrow under the covers, and snuggle up against me.  I know it when he wakes up in the morning, pops his thumb out of his mouth, grins at me, and announces, \"I want to ride in the elevator!\"  I know it when he pounds down the hall straight into my arms when I come home at night. \n\nBut I want to know, really know, that he thinks about me when I'm not there.  That he wonders how my day is going.  I don't know if he does, if he just can't express it, or if he ever will.  But it's part of this whole experience of obliqueness, of hints and sidelong utterances, of mitigated this and theory of that.  Bottom line, I want to hear that sentence again, and not immediately second-guess it out of all existence.\n\nPart of what's hard about this sometimes is that we can't always read the signs our children make for us.  Sometimes we misread, misunderstand, or miss altogether.  Sometimes it feels like listening for a pin to drop...in a wind storm.  Even as we're trying to help our kids communicate, we're also trying, trying to learn their language.  We're trying become better listeners.  And, just like them, we're trying to screen out all the extraneous noise and hear what's really important.

{"date": "March 10, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tI spent the day yesterday at the Jumpstart Learning to Learn conference.  The program was founded by Dr. Bryna Siegel, director of the Children's Center at Langley Porter/UCSF Autism Clinic, \"as a national model to provide needed training to the community of parents, teachers, and clinicians who interact personally and professionally with young children with autism.\"  \n\nFrom what I could tell, the professionals in the audience outnumbered the parents by about three to one, which I found both empowering (good--we'll be on the same page) and a little scary (uh, you mean you guys don't know this already?)  But okay, this is moving so quickly.  Let's all learn at the same time.\n\nDr. Siegel gave the first keynote and Dr. Lynn Koegel gave the second. (If you recall, she was the expert called in for last year's Supernanny episode with an autistic child, which she recounted--amazing story).  Then there were two tracks of three presentations each.  Based on our most pressing issues at the moment, I opted for Dr. Pamela Wolfberg's presentation on integrated play groups, followed by Dr. Siegel's talk on how to match interventions to a child's unique challenges and learning styles.  (For a complete agenda, click here). \n\nAs much as I generally avoid these things (death by Powerpoint), I got a lot out of it.  Here are a few broad themes:\n\n1. Moving away from diagnostic labels, and toward specificity: understanding each child's strengths, challenges and learning styles, and--praise be--matching the interventions to his or her actual needs.  Thank you, Dr. Siegel.\n\n2. Engaging the child is far more important than the type of therapy you are doing.  There are dozens of therapies, and none is a magic bullet.  But engagement trumps everything.  It was quite poignant to hear Dr. Koegel, a behaviorist, talk about how in the early days she saw her patients progressing, but the kids (and their therapists) never smiled.  Then, when they made the sessions more fun, the children began to make faster progress!  It was also quite charming to see how funny and self-effacing she was about admitting this in public.  \n\n3. Using everything your child does--echolalia, stimming, whatever--as information to help you better understand what he is trying to communicate, and what he may need.  This theme pervades Dr. Siegel's work (and, of course, Dr. Stanley Greenspan's) and there's also a wonderful blog called MOM - Not Otherwise Specified that has a brilliant post on the topic: \"Dr. Strangetalk or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Echolalia.\"  And let's apply that philosophy to stimming too, shall we?  (BTW I'm not saying that we shouldn't try to help our kids move past these things...just that we shouldn't obsess about them too much.  And yes, my dear husband, I will remember I said that.)\n\n4. Play is core to the treatment of autism, because play engages every aspect of a child's physical, communicative and social skills.  Dr. Wolfberg is the founder of the Autism Institute on Peer Relations and Play.   The work she is doing with integrated (typical and ASD) playgroups is not to be missed.  The highlight for me: a video showing how, over the course of a few months, they were able to draw a child with apparent Asperger's into the imaginative play of some typically-developing peers--absolutely thrilling to watch.  \n\n\n5. Don't think of insistence on routine as evidence of a disability if a child has difficulty decoding language.  In other words, put yourself in his shoes.  Dr. Siegel gave this example: you are in China, and have been invited to give a speech.  You get to your hotel, and no one speaks English, and you don't speak Chinese.  They give you your key, lead you to your room, and you go to sleep.  The next morning, someone knocks on the door at 8:00 and takes you to the dining room for breakfast.  So, what will you be doing the next morning at 7:55?  Waiting for that knock, of course!  Now imagine that when they come to get you, they lead you to the elevator, but it doesn't stop at the dining room--it goes directly to the lobby.  How do you feel?  Hungry? Confused?  Powerless to communicate?  Like throwing a tantrum until you get your coffee?   \n\nI only have one suggestion for next time: interactive breakout sessions.  It would be great to get more dialogue going, especially among parents and professionals (and give us the opportunity to network in a more relaxed environment--we have so few opportunities for that in daily life).  \n\nWhat came through most strongly at the end of the day: a healthy respect for the mysteries of autism, tempered with the confidence that we're moving in a promising direction.  Works for me. \n\n  \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismjumpstart.org/conference", "http://www.autismjumpstart.org/aboutus#siegel", "http://psych.ucsf.edu/lpphc.aspx?id=438&terms=autism&rawsearchtype=0&fragment=true&SearchType=OrWords", "http://www.education.ucsb.edu/autism/", "http://www.sfsu.edu/~coe/coe/faculty/moreinfo/wolfberg.html", "http://www.autismjumpstart.org/conference", "http://www.stanleygreenspan.com/", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/03/dr-strangetalk-or-how-i-learned-to.html", "http://www.wolfberg.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/03/jumpstart_learn.html", "title": "Jumpstart Conference: Learning to Learn, Learning to Unlearn"},
{"date": "March 20, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tI've been quiet this week, mostly because we are in a new phase with Isaac; one that involves a) a massive sleep boycott and b) multiple nightly visitations when he wakes during the night.  I haven't been too concerned about it, given that he's always been a good sleeper, he's not acting differently otherwise, and it's come with some nice gains in language and engagement--but it's definitely wiping us out over here.  \n\nAnd it's making me face a few facts about myself as a parent: how much unconditional love I give versus, well, tougher love.\n\nThere were a few moments at the Jumpstart conference a couple of weeks ago that clued me in to the ways therapists and other professionals view us parents.  There was one point In Lynn Koegel's presentation about her \"Supernanny\" experience when she and Jo (aka Supernanny) were trying to get the boy to ask for something using language rather than grunting and crying.  The child was getting progressively more distraught, as was Mom.  And there was a ripple of recognition in the audience, one that said: \"Yeah, I've been there when Mom (or Dad) caves at the critical moment.  Happens all the time.\"  \"Okay,\" I thought, \"easy for YOU to watch my child suffer through a milestone that most kids blow past without a moment's thought.\"  But--let's be honest--I know it's not.\n\nSo here we are, night number I've-lost-count in Operation \"For God's Sake, Go To Bed, Isaac!\"  We've tried sitting in the room, progressively moving closer to the door: \"I want Mommy to get on the floor!\"  We've tried a kiss and a brief stay in the room: we lost count after putting him back in bed bed 30+ times in one night.  Tonight, after 45 minutes in the chair listening to his musings about his favorite shapes and the various characters in \"Bob the Builder\" (\"Mr. Sabatini! EXTREME Mr. Sabatini!  I want a triangle!\") I finally crawled into bed beside him.  He was out in 5 minutes.\n\nClearly, I can't do this forever.  I realize it's as much for me as it is for him--perhaps more. He'll be four this summer, and it seems fairly certain at this point that he'll be an only child.  I can't help thinking that I won't have this option much longer--that I have to store it all up now for later, when he's older and we inevitably lose the physical closeness we have now.  But we have to get through this phase, and he has to to be more independent at the end than he was at the beginning.  And we all have to get some sleep.  And I know I have to stop obsessing about whether this is some sort of neurological wake-up-call, and a signal of SOMETHING BIGGER, and just go back to the basic task of helping Isaac get into a new sleep groove, bit by bit.  (I was talking about this a couple of weeks ago to some special-needs-parent friends and we decided that you know it's time to kick your kid out of bed when...his stubble scrapes your cheek in the middle of the night.)  \n\nSo, what's your prediction?  Will I cave again tomorrow?  Or will consistency and common sense prevail?  Tune in for another exciting episode.  And please--wish me luck.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/03/love_love_tough.html", "title": "Love, Love [Tough] Love"},
{"date": "March 12, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tWhen I got home tonight, there was a note from Isaac's school district case manager reminding us of our upcoming IEP.  She had stapled her card to the note, and for the first time I noticed her job title: \"Preschool Autism Behavior Content Specialist, Special Education Services.\"  \n\nThat word again.  \n\nEarly on, Jesse and I spent countless hours in the \"is he or isn't he?\" debate, cataloguing every shred of evidence for and against.  So social!  So remote. So easygoing!  So rigid.  All kids do this!  No, it's a symptom.  And on.  And on.\n\nYou know how when you're with someone long enough, there are some conversations that just keep resurfacing?  We started calling this one \"conversation #862, in which we discuss whether Isaac does or does not have autism.\"  (Another example: conversation #406, in which I am reminded to replace the toothpaste cap on the toothpaste.  It's a blind spot.  I admit it.)\n\nFor days we'd be passionately convinced that Isaac wasn't, you know, that thing--that he just has a speech delay, and some sensory issues, and so that's why he's not so social with his peers, and labels are dumb, and nobody knows anything anyway...and then one day it would hit us in the gut, a sickening feeling: maybe we should just stop fighting this.  \n\nBut a funny thing has happened, not what I expected at all.  I realized Friday, as I sat in the Jumpstart conference, and again tonight as I looked at the card on my kitchen counter, that I'm not so upset by That Word anymore.  I think I've called a truce.\n\nAnd I feel sort of okay about it.  That Word is in our lives--for now.  It's on our paperwork, it's in our emails, it's in the books on my nightstand.

{"date": "March 04, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tBy Jordan Sadler, SLP\n As Susan wrote  about so eloquently, the period of time around an autism diagnosis is acutely distressing for parents.\u00a0 One of the first things parents are generally told to do is to go home and immediately gather a team of competent therapists to work with their child; whether this is done through a school district, early intervention, or privately, this is a daunting process - and would be even without the overlay of grief and anxiety.\u00a0 Parents then discover the variety of treatment strategies available to them; sometimes this may give them a burst of hope for their child, but my sense is that initially it's nothing short of overwhelming.\u00a0 So Susan has asked the therapists contributing to The Family Room to do what we can to help parents figure out what to look for and what to ask when searching for good therapists.\n\nThere are many ways to approach working with a child with an autistic spectrum disorder.\u00a0 I have read recently that, really, any of the most popular strategies will result in positive gains, assuming the child is receiving enough of it as soon as possible, and the parents are involved in the treatment as much as possible. This is not to say that I have no preferences when it comes to treatment, but the fact is, it is going to be up to the parents to determine whether they are most comfortable with DIR/Floortime, RDI, SCERTS, ABA, PECS, and/or TEACCH, to name a few big ones.\u00a0 Some families will find that one clearly resonates with them immediately and others will need to ask the diagnostician, their pediatrician, other parents, and the Internet for advice before making the decision.\u00a0 Of course, you want to find therapists with experience, proper license, and good training.\u00a0 But here are some additional things to look for - and pitfalls to avoid - when searching for your therapists: \n\n1.\u00a0 If a therapist suggests to you that you have \"wasted time\" by not getting help earlier or by taking part in another type of treatment, do not hire that person.\u00a0 A good therapist has no interest in making you, the parent, feel guilty or incompetent.\u00a0 \n\n2. Similarly, consider all statements about missing out on your child's \"window of opportunity\" to be scare tactics. Yes, those neuronal connections develop quickly in the early years, but they continue to develop throughout the life span.\u00a0 By waiting two weeks for your first session because of that family vacation you already had planned, you are not harming your child.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n3. When a therapist or treatment center has a blanket policy of not allowing parents to take part in therapy sessions, consider this a red flag.\u00a0 If your child seems to be overly distracted by your presence in the room and needs a period of time alone with the therapist to establish a relationship before introducing you back into the sessions, so be it.\u00a0 But for a parent to be denied all access to view and participate in therapy, and for no coaching to take place?\u00a0 When the parent asks for it directly?\u00a0 Not good.\n\n4. Pay attention to the attitude of the therapist when you make the initial contact.\u00a0 Does he/she try to sell you on a particular treatment, assuming it works for all children, or are you asked questions about your specific child?\u00a0 Be cautious about one-size-fits-all approaches and those who feel they can treat all children with one treatment approach.\u00a0 You want to find therapists who see your child as a unique individual; the good therapist will meet your child where he or she is and build from there.\n\n5.\u00a0 Find therapists who are willing to take the time required to establish a positive relationship with your child before expecting any learning to take place.\u00a0 There are children who will walk in the door and feel comfortable, connected and ready to learn.\u00a0 Then there are others who need a lot of time with a therapist - time without demands, when the pair can simply work up to joyful interactions at the child's own pace.\u00a0 This might involve spending a session lying on the floor together, listening to the child's favorite music, and requiring absolutely nothing of the child.\u00a0 The child may start the session cautious and disengaged, but by the end of the hour may be cuddled up with the therapist, stealing glances and smiling at her.\u00a0 This time is well-spent because within a few weeks, the pair has formed a trusting relationship in which the child is willing to take some risks and move outside of familiar patterns.\u00a0 Now learning can take place.\n\n6.\u00a0 Be sure you are getting consistent communication from your therapist and find out if he/she communicates regularly with other team members via phone calls, email, sharing notes, etc.\u00a0 A therapist operating as a cooperative member of a larger team is going to have a greater impact on your child's development.\n\nIn the end, you want to work with professionals who respect you as a parent and love your child for being the amazing individual he or she is.\u00a0 When these qualities are in place, so much growth can happen for your child. \n\nTo reach Jordan directly, email: Jordan [at] communicationtherapy [dot] net.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.communicationtherapy.net/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/03/searching_for_t.html", "title": "Searching for Therapists"},
{"date": "March 24, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tSo for some reason I decided today to go through the toys in Isaac's room and weed out the broken, the outgrown, the parts to-who-knows-what and the stuff that, let's face it, he's never really played with, or played appropriately with.  From the start, he wasn't much of a toys guy, preferring books, music, snuggling, physical play and long walks.  A lot like us, really.\n\nSo I told Isaac we were going to his room to make a big mess (gotta love reverse psychology), put on \"House Party Time\" by Dan Zanes, and we (more specifically, I) got to work.  He emptied baskets onto the floor, while I crawled under the bed, reached behind the bookshelves and found a great number of things that at some point in the past I, or someone else, had thought Isaac might like: the racetrack that broke after one day, the plastic pieces to a toy castle that I had stuffed in the closet during a particularly severe period of door obsession, random pages ripped from books, the spines of those poor denuded books, dried Play Doh, broken crayon pieces.  And Isaac got to throw them all into the trash--big fun for him (and, who can forget, so good for the visual-motor coordination).\n\nBut there were a few trapdoors. Our beloved Richard Scarry books, which are apparently so visually oversimulating for Isaac that he can fixate on one endlessly, moving it past his face while he stares at it through the corner of one eye; his little wooden Thomas set, which my sister bought him for his second birthday and I excitedly set up, only to burst into tears as he took each piece of track apart and put it in his mouth; a plush turtle puppet I bought in an effort to jumpstart his pretend play, which he found so terrifying that I had to hide it in the closet for months (Was that imagination? Maybe even a good sign?)\n\nIt's better now--much better.  The Scarry books are still a minefield, but he adores Dr. Seuss' Oh, The Places You'll Go!  He likes toy cars and plays a little with the Thomas train track.  And several months ago he finally started picking up crayons.  So...progress.  But it does hit me hard sometimes, this sense of norms, and the many ways that he just...sideswipes them.  And I wonder what he'll be like in two, five, ten years--whether he'll be anxious, lonely or happily quirky.  Whether he'll ever figure out pronouns.  Whether he'll have friends.  And whether he'll ever be able to tell me what he did that day, and how it feels  to be him, living in this world.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.danzanes.com/pages/home.php"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/03/so_for_some_rea.html", "title": "Toy Story"},
{"date": "March 28, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tIt's that time of year again: my throat is raw, my eyes start itching and I can feel a dull headache starting at my temples.  Yep, you guessed it: IEP season.  The IEP, or Individualized Education Program, is the result of well-meaning legislators and educators to provide an appropriate and individualized education for children with disabilities.  It's a time to review forms, and more forms, each of which lays out tiny and discrete hoops for your particular small hero to jump through.  To wit: has he learned appropriate use of prepositions?  Can he satisfactorily pretend to have a birthday party? Can he draw a square?  A person?  A faithful representation of the cathedral at Chartres?  \n\nIf your child is anything like mine, he will jump readily through some hoops, grudgingly through others, ignore several altogether, and light a few last ones on fire and sprinkle the ashes all over your living-room carpet.  This leads to a deeply surreal IEP meeting, in which you, the parent, attempt to tease out the actual meaning of these skills (does it matter that he's nailed \"on top of\" but still isn't so clear about \"under\"?) and their impact on his future life and prospects.  May I make a suggestion?  Stop.  Right now.  Before you feel the impact of your head hitting the wall multiple times.  You cannot know this.  I have been there, and it's not worth the trip. \n\nEven if you are lucky enough to have strong and committed teachers and school district representatives who are genuinely trying to do the best by your child, you will still most likely survive the meeting with a new appreciation of what it must feel like to be an actor in a bad soap opera.  They say something.  You say something.  They say something back.  Nothing makes a whole lot of sense, but you have to go with it.  Why is this, you ask?  Answer: you cannot fully know.  But just consider their most likely motivations, in no particular order: 1) needs of the many kids they serve 2) the needs of your child; 3) fear of liability; and 4) budgetary and other stuff.\n\nNow for a bit of practical advice:\n\n1. Assume (unless proven otherwise) that the school district is doing the best they can.\n2. Know what your child requires, and his rights, versus what's being offered--and what you're willing to compromise on.\n3. If you get frustrated, don't get mad, but do be persistent.  This is really easy to say, incredibly hard to do.\n4. Don't sign anything in the room if you can help it.  Even if the meeting is sunlight and roses, a good night's sleep can help you see more clearly the next day.  \n\nI'll write after our meeting and let you know how successful I was in taking my own advice.  \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ed.gov/parents/needs/speced/iepguide/index.html", "http://www.yale.edu/adhoc/teaching_resources/700a96/images/cd2/2im8.gif", "http://www.law.duke.edu/childedlaw/rightssummary.html"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/03/its_that_time_o.html", "title": "Zen and the Art of the IEP"},

{"date": "April 15, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tIt's common for kids with sensory integration or autism spectrum issues to be afraid of haircuts.  When you think about it, it's a pretty rational fear--a stranger straps you into a chair, wets your head, comes at you with scissors--but for kids on the spectrum even the sound of those scissors (or God forbid the electric trimmer) can send them over the edge into a flailing, wailing meltdown.\n\nOur local shop is tricked out with toys, lollipops, even a Thomas train table to soothe the reluctant guest.  The first time I brought Isaac he was about a year old, and the Russian woman at the front took a look at him, then me, and asked: \"You want regular boy haircut?\"  Honestly, I had never even thought about it.  What are the options, I wondered?  Mohawk?  Mullet?  Bowl cut?  \"Sure,\" I answered.  \"Regular boy haircut.\"  We went home in one piece: he with a new toy train, me with a slightly damp envelope containing a few wisps of his baby hair to keep as a memento. \n\nIsaac withstood the first few haircuts pretty well.  He let himself be distracted by one or two of the toys and didn't seem to mind the process much.  Then, sometime around his second birthday, I brought him in but wasn't able to stop the haircutter before she spritzed him with water.  It was all downhill from there: screaming, crying, hitting, falling to the floor--if you're reading this, you've probably been there.  The woman did the best she could with a living, breathing, screaming target.  He went home that day unhurt, but with puffy eyes and a cut that made him look a little like Edward Scissorhands on a bad hair day.  I left a ridiculous tip.\n\nThe next few were similarly awful, so much so that at one point he'd start to cry whenever we drove down that particular block.  So without really meaning to, we would stretch out the time between haircuts until he started to look like Elvis junior: at which point we would break down and bring him in again (although I'm telling you: I was sorely tempted to try barrettes).  He had to be cut standing at the train table, with his hair dry, no smock, and at least one adult holding him at all times.  We asked our ABA providers for ideas, and they suggested we try a social story about haircuts, and weave it in with some pretend play.  It was slow at first: he resisted it and didn't seem to want to play haircut any more than he wanted to get one.  But we persisted, and started to notice that the next time was easier (i.e., crying, but no flailing and hitting) and the next time, easier still (added bonus: the haircuts got better too).  We would reinforce it by casually saying \"Isaac, you really need a haircut\" while ruffling his hair.  Sometimes he'd disagree, saying \"No haircut!  Haircut's all done!\"  \n\nThen about a week ago, Isaac was taking a walk with Beata, his nanny, and the wind was blowing his hair into his face.  He looked up at her and announced \"I need a haircut!\"  So Jesse took him a few days later.  Isaac still cried, but it was bearable.  He later informed us that he wanted another one.  We didn't oblige, but at least we know we have the option for next time. \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thegraycenter.org/socialstories.cfm"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/04/regular_boy_hai.html", "title": "Regular Boy Haircut"},

{"date": "April 18, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tSeveral months ago, we began the bizarre and weirdly emotional process of potty training our son.  We bought pull-ups, we collected whimsical potty books, we got detailed instructions and excel spreadsheets from our ABA team (for data collection) and a plastic bucket (for...).  We loaded up on fun DVDs he can watch during potty sessions.  He learned the steps quickly: he loved sitting on the potty, loved flushing, loved the ritual of washing and drying his hands, even loved his potty seat, proudly carrying it around the house, but...no luck.\n\nFast-forward a few months (okay, several months) and we are being politely but firmly encouraged to try this again.  Again we have the spreadsheets, the paraphernalia, and on Saturday I went to buy my boy his very first set of big kid underpants.  And I have to tell you, I felt a little emotional standing there at the display.  Do I get colors?  White?  Dinosaurs?  Superman?  (In the interest of protecting whatever shred of privacy is left at this point, I leave that to your imagination, dear reader.)\n\nDuring his bath that night, he played with a green plastic dolphin, filling it with water and letting the water run out into the tub.  Then he looked up at me and said: \"The dolphin has to go pee-pee,\" and emptied it into the tub again, giggling.  Yesterday, Jesse came home to a whole potty convention in our house, including one ABA tutor, one case manager, our nanny and, of course, the life of the party himself, who was looking a little grumpy by this point.  Then this morning, as soon as he woke up, he demanded to sit on the potty again, where he ate a banana, drank a glass of milk, and happily watched an episode and a half of Harold and the Purple Crayon (delaying my shower and causing a Very Bad Hair Day).  And I suddenly realized: the bathroom has become his new office.  And I can't help but wonder: how did we do this stuff before there were specialists, and Microsoft Excel, and DVDs and cheese crackers and--honestly--does it really take a village to potty train a child?   \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.k-state.edu/english/nelp/purple/books/harold.html"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/04/pottypalooza_20.html", "title": "Potty Training, Part Deux"},

{"date": "April 11, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tInterview with Fiona Zecca\nEarly Childhood Development and Behavioral Specialist\n\n It occurred to me after my recent post on the Individualized Education Program (IEP) process that it might be helpful to have someone discuss this issue from a professional's point of view.  So I asked Fiona Zecca, an early childhood development and behavioral specialist, for her perspective on how to make this a more effective and less stressful experience. Fiona spent 15 years working in school settings as a special day class teacher and an inclusion specialist with young children with special needs. She also had the opportunity to work as part of the Intake Assessment team at the San Francisco Unified School District. She is now in private practice, offering consulting services to schools and families around the Bay Area.  \n\nHow would you advise parents prepare for the IEP?\n1. Be familiar with the format and purpose of the IEP.\n2. Try to find someone who has been through it to give you some idea of what the meeting will look like.\n3. If possible, try to get copies of any of the assessment reports conducted before the meeting so you have a chance to read them and organize any questions you might have.\n4. Ask for your parent rights ahead of time and read them over so you understand them and don't waste precious time during the meeting learning what they are.\n5. Although the IEP team members will bring different ideas on potential goals for your child, I recommend writing down a few ideas on what you would like your child to achieve in the next year.  Be specific, and think of things that you wish your child could do: in a social setting, to get ready in the morning; when communicating with his grandmother.  Try to think of all developmental areas--language, gross motor, fine motor, sensory integration, social and self-help.  Be realistic, but don't be afraid to have some things to work towards.\n6. Try to find out ahead of time what services the district offers for your child's age group.\n\nIs there a good resource you can recommend for parents to go to understand their--and their children's--rights?\nYes.  Here is a link to the Special Education Rights of Parents and Children, published by the California Department of Education.  [Note: if you live outside of California, search the Internet for \"Special Education Rights\" and your state.]\n\nWhat should parents do if they feel they are not getting the services they need or are entitled to?\nExplain to the team what services you would like and why.  If you have any previous assessment reports that state recommendations for your child, present them to the team.  Be realistic, but don't give up easily.  Continue the dialogue with the IEP tem and hope that you can come to an agreement.  This may mean compromising on each side.  If this doesn't work, don't be afraid to dissent on the IEP.\n\nAre there any common misconceptions about the IEP process that you'd like to clear up?\nThe IEP is a legal document stating the special education servies that your child will receive, but don't think that if you sign it you are bound to the parameters in the IEP for the duration of the IEP (typically a year).  You can request an IEP at any time--they are geared to be done annually, but you can have one whenever you want.  In fact, you can request at the time of the IEP that the next IEP be done in less than a year (i.e., six months).  In other words, if you sign and then later conclude that the services being provided for your child are not a good fit, you can request an IEP (in writing) and, if necessary, dissent at that time.  Also, it is helpful to know that you may bring anyone you want to the IEP without notfying the other team members (with the exception of legal representation, for which the district requires prior written notification).\n\nAny other advice?\nDon't get caught up in the formality of the IEP.  Try not to let it make you anxious or nervous.  You know your child best, and you are your child's best advocate.  Try to be positive and open-minded and hope that the IEP team members have the best intentions for your child, but, if necessary, be firm on what you believe your child needs. \n\nIf you would like to ask Fiona a question, leave a comment here or contact her directly at fiona [at]fionazecca [dot] com.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.brokenbricks.com/fionazecca/", "http://www.ed.gov/parents/needs/speced/iepguide/index.html", "http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/se/qa/documents/psenglsh.pdf"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/04/strategies_for_.html", "title": "Strategies for an Effective IEP"},

{"date": "April 22, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tYesterday I went to the Support for Families of Children with Disabilities 2007 Information & Resource Conference.  It amazes me what this group, which seems to be run on about five dollars and sheer will, can pull off.  They ran 14 workshops in two tracks, ranging from \"Adaptive Sports\" to \"Planning for Inclusive Transitions Across School Levels\" to \"Legal Rights of Public School Students with Disabilities.\"  I chose two subjects that are near and dear to my heart these days: \"Food & Eating Issues for Children with Autism\" and \"Toilet Training Children with Special Needs,\"  the latter of which was run by Melissa Willa of Gateway Learning Group.   Both sessions took a behavioral approach, and I could again see how these new ways of conducting ABA can open up whole worlds for children: a new degree of independence, the tolerance for--even interest in--new types of foods.  The initial approach in these specific instances may be more adult led, but the consequences ultimately empower the kids to make a broader range of choices for themselves over time.  So again that difficult balance between ABA and Floortime, between the child's agenda and the therapist's.  \n\nBoth sessions reminded me that too often we rush into our kids' programs without really getting enough of the context behind what our providers plan to do.  As a result, things that you think of as kind of optional (switching reinforcers, or forgetting to tell your school what you're doing at home) can have an impact and stretch out the learning process.  And things that you slowly begin to disagree with (for example, the degree to which your child is pushed in a particular session), can become a real source of tension.  So it was helpful to have an opportunity to sit down and start from the very beginning. \n\nI can't possibly do justice to each session, but I do have one suggestion, and it's pretty simple. Even if you do team meetings already, try to find some non-therapy, non-IEP time to talk to your providers individually, even for a few minutes, so you can discuss what's on your mind and start to work it into your child's program.  I realized yesterday that I had been worrying about Isaac's somewhat limited food repertoire, but in the chaos of everything else I wasn't even aware of it until I saw this class on the agenda.  So now I'll approach his case manager to talk about it, and probably even add it to the IEP.  (Tip: you CAN add eating and potty objectives to your child's IEP...I didn't realize that before).\n\nLast thing, since I'm apparently on an advice kick today: take a breath.  Not every minute of our lives should be a learning opportunity, or a heroically therapeutic moment.  Autism may be a communication disorder, but there's plenty of communication in stillness, and silence, too.  (Not to mention the guilty pleasure of sharing a pizza while you watch \"Dancing with The Stars\" together.)\n\nFor a copy of Melissa's presentation on toilet training, click here: Download toilet_training_presentation.pdf\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.supportforfamilies.org/", "http://www.gatewaylg.com/ourpeople.html", "http://www.gatewaylg.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/04/so_yesterday_i_.html", "title": "Notes From \"Support For Families\" Conference"},
{"date": "April 26, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tTo me, one of the greatest sorrows of this whole \"autism spectrum\" business is that it can so easily color your perspective on even the simplest things.  Back in October, Isaac went through a very difficult behavioral phase.  Normally a happy kid, he suddenly started lashing out at us, having tantrums--basically acting like a real pill.  We were worried, but not overly so, since even typically developing kids can hit the terrible twos at three, or even later.  So we figured we'd grit our teeth and get through it.  \n\nThen one night his behavior took a dramatic turn for the worse: he refused to go to bed and instead went into full-scale meltdown, thrashing around on the floor, screaming and crying and hitting everything in sight.  This went on for a few terrifying, sleepless nights.  We tried to imagine what it could be, with no success.  He didn't seem sick, nothing particularly stressful had happened, no big changes in routine.  We thought we'd give it another day, then call the doctor.  But the main thing running through my mind was \"Sudden, dramatic personality change?  Not good.\"  \n\nOn the third or fourth morning, I scraped myself together and went to meet with two new clients.  Luckily, they also happened to be mothers of young children.  I let them know that my son was ill and that I might need to answer a call on my cell phone.  They asked me what was wrong, and without mentioning anything about Isaac's developmental delays, I told them about the behavior: the screaming at bedtime, the tantrums, and that this morning I noticed he was rubbing his ears quite a bit.\n\n\"Ear infection,\" they chimed.  And, when I stared back at them completely dumfounded, one smiled warmly and asked, \"Now don't you feel like the worst mother ever?\"  It was all I could do not to break into grateful sobs then and there.  \n\nLong story short: it wasn't some kind of horrible autistic regressive episode, it didn't mean that my sweet boy's personality was gone forever: it was Isaac's very first garden-variety nonautistic universal kid ear infection, and it, and the behavior, cleared up as soon as we started the antibiotics.  \n\n***\n\nYesterday morning we heard the unmistakable barky cough that always signals a trip to the emergency room and a long night ahead.  But for some reason I convinced myself that, since it had been two years since Isaac's last croup, this must just be an allergic reaction to all the pollen at the park.  Duh.  Back to urgent care last night, where they were surprisingly ill-equipped to deal with a frightened preschooler with special needs.  The doctor seemed to think that speaking very quickly and loudly while waving her stethoscope around would convince Isaac to let her examine him, but he had other ideas.  And I found myself in that familiar, horrible position of having to explain for my child.  And I hate that, because it always feels like such a betrayal.  And it makes me resent these people who are basically just trying to do their jobs, see as many kids as quickly as they can, but who still seem so completely at a loss around my son.  And I can't help but think: if with all their training they can still be so stiff and awkward around a child with special needs, what can we expect from the rest of the world?\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/04/sometimes_a_col.html", "title": "Sometimes a Cold is Just a Cold"},
{"date": "September 23, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\r\n There is something about autism that taps into the most primal beliefs we have about the nature of consciousness, of intelligence, of humanity. There's a fairytale quality to the way the media portray autism, and I mean this in two diametrically opposite ways: both the happy/quirky/technicolor and the clammy/dread-inducing/Grimm's tales sense of the word.Depending on who you believe, autism is an epidemic, a scourge, a pathology, a condition, a series of genetic variations, a difference, an asset, or all or none of these things. \u00a0There are as many autisms as there are people with autism. There are as many autisms as there are colors. There are as many interpretations of it as there are interpretations of the Constitution, of politics, of religion.All these variables make people nuts.I started this blog nearly three years ago because I wanted to reach out to families who, like us, started their journey in a cold sweat of fear, despair and confusion. I wanted to share what we've learned, and offer comfort and hope when I had the presence of mind to write it down. \u00a0I wanted to tell you about the weird, the painful, the hilarious and the joyous, and find out if anybody else out there was on the same wavelength. \u00a0I've met some of my best friends this way (you can meet a lot of them on my blogroll).I know that our story will only resonate for some families, because all kids with autism are different. But even though all kids with autism are different, they are also sometimes the same: when they melt down spectacularly in public, when they struggle with something that \"typical\" kids understand innately, when they fight to regulate their senses, when they do something socially awkward, when they communicate--with a word, a smile, a spontaneous hug--their joy in the world.I am not a sap about this. It's difficult. It's exhausting. It's frightening sometimes. It's bloody expensive. It's tough on my marriage, my family, my friends and probably my health. \u00a0But I am happy. My son and husband are happy. \u00a0So I reject you, Autism Speaks, for mongering fear and hatred with this hideous new video. For forgetting that people with autism deserve respect, and for demonizing them even as you seek to raise funds to support and treat them.It's manipulative, hypocritical, counterproductive, cynical and, frankly, beneath you.I'll tell you what. I don't know what life holds for Isaac, or for any of my friends' children. I want all the same things things everyone wants, and I won't stop working for it.But what I demand for him, and for kids and adults on the spectrum, is respect. Yes, we need to raise money for treatment, understanding, respite care, research: all of those things.But respect is free.

Everything was conceived to support the students while maximizing their learning opportunities: a technology center, a rec room, \"The Loft,\" an apartment-like series of rooms for socializing and life skills education, a kitchen and a garden where the students can grow vegetables which they will eventually harvest, make into soup and sell locally.\u00a0There's even a \"touchdown\" area with tiny cubicles meant to help the students practice telephone conversations.\u00a0It's a dream--quite literally--come true.\r\nClosest to my heart, and the reason I was there, is a classroom called \"Camilla's Crew,\" in which the staff offers vocational training to people with autism. The teachers assess the clientele--their strengths, preferences, challenges--and then work with them to develop the types of skills that will help them land and keep a job.\u00a0\r\nCamilla is my cousin, and she'll be 14 this year.

The other night in the ER, the doctor asked if his throat hurt and without even thinking, I snapped: \"He can't tell you.\"   Was I trying to protect him?  Save time?  Don't ask.  In fact, Isaac hasn't yet verbally identified pain; a few nights ago he bumped his mouth hard on the side of the bathtub and, through his tears, wailed, \"That was SURPRISING!\"  But sometimes he'll do something so seemingly ordinary and yet so momentous that my breath catches in my throat, and all the hopes that I'd stuffed inside my inner broom closet come tumbling out into the light.  It reminds me of the feeling you get when you enter a warm house on a freezing day: first some tingling, then a little pain, and, finally, the warmth seeping through your body.\n\nI didn't quite believe it when Jesse told me that he'd picked up Isaac at school on Tuesday to find him playing a board game with another little boy.  It just didn't register, and Jesse had to repeat it several times.  I still didn't quite get it when Jesse came home the other night with this magical box, played four consecutive games with no prompting, and invited me to try.  Who's the one with auditory processing problems, you may wonder?  \n\n So we tried it today.  The game is called Cariboo and it's made by Cranium.  Somehow it manages to combine several elements that Isaac loves--balls, doors, shapes and numbers--with fine-motor practice in a turn-taking game.  There's even an imaginative aspect for the kids who are ready for it.  The downside: certain people can get a little over-focused on opening and closing the doors, but it's a small price to play for such a huge milestone and the opportunity to interact more meaningfully with other children.  \n\nNow, like the research scientists we've become, the next step is to determine whether our little miracle is repeatable outside the lab.

Mmmmmm!ISAAC: Ana likes the carrots, Ana can eat the carrots.And here we are. He walks into assembly at school now, completely untroubled. Months ago, he refused to go near the place with its linoleum floors, bright lights and deafening clamor. The anxiety is still there, as is the elevator obsession, joined by a new companion: buses.These days, I awake as often as not to a recitation of our municipal bus lines. It's part of the deal, our special interest, if you will. It doesn't faze me too much--I remember my grand passion for escalators at that age--but then the world has a way of intruding into our snug little cocoon.The world loves norms, doesn't it?*When my mother died, a part of me watched with detachment as I moved through the stages of grief--frequently all at once. But one thing people don't tell you is that your friends and acquaintances move through those stages with you as well. They have a timeline too.They begin with shock, as we the bereaved do. Then kindness (sometimes distancing). Food is brought, hugs given, long weepy monologues patiently listened to. Assurances--\"whatever you need...\" are made. But then, at some predetermined yet mysterious moment, there is a shift.You are supposed to be better. You are supposed to be back to normal. Because--let's face it--we humans are made profoundly uncomfortable by variations from the norm.But the truth is that the bereaved accommodate as well. We try to pass. We pretend to feel better. We pretend to be back to normal. We simmer with anger. Or we express that anger.Because then we have two things to battle: the grief, and the illusion that the grief is gone.And this is where we are, in a way. As my boy matures, behavior that was passed off lightly at two or even four is now so much more evident. When he is overcome at school and lies on the classroom floor, or when he refuses to exit the elevator, demanding yet another ride, the climate shifts, and everyone has to accommodate themselves to this departure from the expected.They want him to be normal, because, you know, it's so much easier.But here's what I've learned. My normal has stretched to accommodate a lot more than it used to. And with that comes a certain serenity about what is happening at any given time.\u00a0So here is my advocacy project, my challenge to you and to the people around you.

And because I am very concerned with the way autism is portrayed in said media (can you hear me, Autism Speaks?) I try to offer some POV when asked (okay, even when not asked :-) So I was happy to speak with Susan Donaldson James of ABC News about a research\u00a0study conducted at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona.\u00a0\r\nThe study is concerned with the joint attention of people with autism, and uses magic (yes, magic!) as a way to better understand how people with autism perceive situations differently from us neurotypicals. Is it true that people with autism can't be fooled by magic tricks? \u00a0Read the article and see what you think.\r\nMy role in the piece, entitled Autism Study Could Find Answers in Magic, was as the \"balance\"; I honestly don't know enough about the study or about neuroscience--let's be frank--to draw an intelligent conclusion about its results. But what mattered to me was that this piece not go down the path of so many that portray people with autism as cold, robotic, and, unfailingly, \"locked inside a world of their own.\"\u00a0\r\nThose stories tend to negate the humanity of people with autism--a spectrum as wide as the Montana sky--and, I fear, terrify parents, especially the ones with new diagnoses, at a time when they are most vulnerable. And it's important to remember that communication is a two-way street: just because people with autism may be looking in a different direction or have a different expression from what we would deem \"appropriate\" in a particular situation, that doesn't mean they lack feeling or a sense of mutuality with us. \u00a0They just may process and express those feelings differently.\u00a0\r\nSo I was thrilled to see Ms. James seek out a broader perspective, interviewing an adult with autism about his experience of the world,\u00a0and did what I could to offer a parent's perspective.\u00a0\r\nAs always, I'd love your thoughts.\r\n\r\n\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/", "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory?id=8864525", "http://www.thebarrow.org/index.htm", "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Autism/autism-diagnoses-treatments-found-study-magic/Story?id=8988702&page=1"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2009/11/can-magic-help-us-understand-autism.html", "title": "Can Magic Help Us Understand Autism?"},
{"date": "October 19, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t Yet another study showing that children on the autism spectrum have roughly the same mercury levels as those without; a family, for their 15 seconds of fame, pretends their son floated off in a makeshift balloon (I'm not even going to bother linking this), and H1N1 continues to send chills up the spines of everyone I know, parents or not. \u00a0The truth is, we're in a good groove. \"Mommy's happy,\" Isaac told me today. And then, \"You look better.\" This because I have spent the last week fighting H1N1, trying by turns to rest, get some work done, and wipe down every surface I touch, which is harder than it sounds. But it's up to the fates at this point; I'm a petri dish, no matter how many bottles of hand sanitizer I go through. \u00a0And every day that passes without Isaac showing symptoms is a gift, and so we wait and see if we can all get through this unscathed.\"You look better.\" If I could bottle the rush of feeling those words give me and hand them out to every newly-diagnosed parent I know, I would. Four years ago, when we were paralyzed with fear and grief, and experts gave us an endless procession of dark looks, pamphlets and assorted laminated materials, I prayed (and I am not, I admit, a religious person) for my son to look at me, really look at me, and tell me what was on his mind. I prayed for him to argue with me, to tell me how he was feeling, to ask a question, to snuggle up to me in a movie theater, happily munching popcorn. Now, at age six, he's done all these things, and worn the 3-D glasses to boot.\u00a0Now he lies in bed reading a pile of Arthur books before bed (six is about average these days), tells us when he's upset and needs a hug and asks everyone--even strangers--how old they are. It's not much, as social gestures go, but the first step is a doozy. \u00a0I am grateful beyond measure.And yes, for the sake of clarity, he's on the autism spectrum; autistic if you prefer. Still is, probably always will be. We're not talking recovery or magical thinking here. His autism is a part of him, as much as his sandy hair, his brown eyes, his impish sense of humor.This year I made a 3/4 year's resolution, which I've never done before, being the sort of person who never makes resolutions of any kind. It came to me partly because of the economy, and partly because the kid is so full of surprises lately. And it's this: don't give in to fear. In these dark, celebrity-obsessed, culture-of-fear times, I'm going to drop a little \"Greatest Generation\" wisdom on you from FDR's first inaugural address: \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" \u00a0I'm not usually one for Serious Quotes from the Greats, but this one feels very personal right now, especially given the recent (ahem!) Autism Speaks\u00a0video, which rivals Paranormal Activity for scaring the living crap out of people.A box came from Amazon tonight. \"It's my surprise!\" Isaac exclaimed as J. opened it for him. Isaac took out the packing plastic, and then the packing slip (looking frankly a little dubious), only\u00a0to find nestled beneath a pile of new Arthur books. He paused for a moment, not having yet been inducted into the mysteries of Books That Come in the Mail.\u00a0\"Where did they come out of?\" he asked.

Isaac had a good session today!\"  His interest in pretend play really seems to be increasing.\"\nMarch 17: \"After returning from his diaper change, Isaac seemed less interested in pretend play, preferring repetitive actions with some of the toys and askng to leave.\"\n\nThere's a lot of progress here, as with his other therapies: More social engagement, more interest in pretend play, more language, but I guess it's a combination of things that's got me down: reading about him in third person, seeing how even his gains highlight the areas where he's struggling, seeing him through a clinician's eyes.  Now this isn't a criticism...it has to be done.  But he's my beautiful boy, after all.\n\n***\n\nSo yesterday we piled into the car and drove up to Rohnert Park, where my high school friend Dina's son is at school.  We hadn't seen each other since our 10-year reunion, when he was still just a toddler.  And I got to see her parents, who I hadn't seen since feathered hair was all the rage, and meet her beautiful, creative kids.  Here I am with a not-quite-four year old, and she has a son in college.  Crazy.   \n\nIsaac was okay--he sat companionably at the table for a while during the meal, ate most of his sandwich and sneaked as many of my fries as he could, but after a bit he decided it was enough, so Jesse took him for a walk. When we left, Dina's mom gave me a big hug and said \"I hope it all works out for you.\"  \n\n***\n\nEven other people's compassion is hard sometimes.  I just remembered a time at the very beginning of all this, when we were looking for a speech therapist for Isaac.  A woman came to our house and spent a depressing hour trying to engage him in some sort of play.  He wasn't having it.  I remember trying to explain that he's actually very engaged when he's having a good time, but nothing she did seemed to interest him.  After a while, she said that she didn't think she'd be able to work with him.  Her eyes were filled with tears as she left.\n\n***\n\nLast night, as Isaac snuggled up with me for a few minutes before his bedtime,  we said goodnight to all his teachers, therapists and friends: \"Good night Tim, Lisa, Jackie, Mary, Abby, Carol, Akemi, Jamie, Robert, Elena, Liana, Melissa, Liesl, Debra, Henry...\"  Then he switched to the trains in Thomas the Tank Engine, and, from there, shapes, numbers and letters (\"Goodnight, letter 'H'!\"), and on and on.  Finally, he scrunched up to me, pulled his thumb out of his mouth, and gave me a huge grin.  \"Good night, Mommmmmy!\"   We walked down the hallway to his room, and he burrowed into his covers and went to sleep.  \n\nThat's Isaac through my eyes.  \n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/04/other_peoples_e.html", "title": "Other People's Eyes"},

I thought it was so timely and helpful that I asked if she would be willing to let me share it with you all, and, lucky for us, she did.\n\nAs our children move forward developmentally, \"typical\" phases that were previously delayed may emerge. One example is the (so-called) \"terrible twos.\" Many kids on the autism spectrum never had the \"terrible twos,\" a time when children become more engaged in their world, with new-found communication, mobility and intentions (\"I want\u201d/\u201dMe do it...\")\n\nSo when parents start reporting to me that their child is tantruming and oppositional and won't do what they say, I say \"great!\u201d  The child has moved beyond the earlier, more disconnected, passive or self-absorbed phase and demonstrated that he is \"cooking.\" It's when a child doesn't move to this phase that I am concerned. \n\nOf course, with these changes, the child is, perhaps for the first time, bumping into \"NO.\"\n\nNow we have a new set of challenges--not bad, just different. As your child moves forward into this phase, he is also much more aware of the complexities of his environment, the expectations of others, the world moving too fast, too loud, too bright around him. Though he now understands far more language, he may be slow to process it, and many adults forget that the child can't take in a wall of words.\n\nMotor planning, still often immature, becomes frustrating for your child, for how exactly is little Johnny going to get from here to there? A profound desire to be \"in control\" kicks in, as though saying, \"Wait a minute! Slow down!!!\" So many kids in this situation need to put their brakes on and try to hold onto control, particularly during transitions (into the car, into bed, out the door, TV off...). \n\nSensory issues may also be involved. \"No\" for our children is a bit of a different experience than it is for a typically developing child. With awareness and engagement with their environment, often more sensory issues emerge during this phase. This can create a very challenging pattern of behaviors--look at how many transitions occur in any given day!\n\nA child at this phase needs a lot of transactional support to help ease his movement through the day. You have to experiment with what will work.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.lisadefaria.com/page/page/4598432.htm"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/05/bumping-into-no.html", "title": "Bumping into \u2018NO\u201d: Managing Tantrums in Kids on the Spectrum"},
{"date": "April 05, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\tInterview with Melissa Willa, M.A., BCBA\nGateway Learning Group\n\n When I first contacted Melissa Willa a little more than a year ago, I was extremely nervous and skeptical about whether behavioral therapy, specifically, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), would be a good choice for Isaac.\u00a0 I was worried that it would be too rigid and that it would conflict with the more child-led DIR/Floortime approach we were taking.\u00a0 Melissa and her team proved me wrong.\u00a0 They are respectful of Isaac, tuned into his personality, strengths and challenges, and are able to bring out his joy in learning.\u00a0 Then about a month ago at the Jumpstart Conference, I learned that eclectic approaches to therapy are becoming more common.\u00a0 So I asked Melissa to share her point of view on how to make an integrated ABA and Floortime program work.\nCan DIR/Floortime and ABA be integrated?\nDefinitely. The field of ABA has evolved over the past ten years; there has been a \"leftwards\" movement toward a more developmental approach.\u00a0 Ten years ago, most ABA providers were still very traditional. Sessions were largely adult-directed, and it was rare to see teaching sessions conducted using more naturalistic approaches. Natural environment techniques were always included to some degree; however, these tactics often took the back seat to more structured \"discrete-trial\" learning opportunities. Today we're seeing a movement toward more naturalistic, developmentally appropriate behavioral interventions.\u00a0 What this means is that instead of ABA sessions being 90 percent adult-directed, sessions are conducted with a more natural back-and-forth flow of adult-led and child-led activities. Instructional activities are more play-based, centering on the unique interests of each child. If you look at the Floortime model, it's maybe 90 percent child-led.  In the past, there used to be a real disparity between these approaches; now they are closer together.\u00a0 So Floortime and ABA can be integrated into a child's overall program, just like speech and occupational therapies. And if Floortime and ABA therapists collaborate within a session, each can pick up some techniques from the other.\n\nSo how does this work?\nYou really do need to have providers who are willing to work together. It's true that there are folks who feel these methods to be mutually exclusive, and they don't need to be. So look for people who are open to collaborating, and who see the other approach as having value to the family. \n\nWhat do you do when there's a conflict between DIR/Floortime and ABA approach within a session?\nTalk about it. That's why it's so important to have team meetings monthly, or for therapists to touch base over the phone when they can't meet in person. \n\nCan you give an example?\nSure. I had a situation where a child was having a challenge mastering a new skill. The Floortime therapist felt that the child needed to be provided with more \"wait time\" after being given the direction, while our ABA team felt that an \"errorless learning\" prompting approach was necessary. Historically, ABA has developed a bad rap for making kids prompt dependent. So we had a dialogue about that. I asked the Floortime therapist why she felt the child needed more time to figure it out on his own, and I explained why we felt that we should prompt him--to help him respond correctly, in order for the child to receive lots of positive feedback without practicing the skill incorrectly. When we talked about it, we came to the conclusion that it made sense to give the child extra time on skills that he had already demonstrated independently, but for new skills, we would help him sooner--to reinforce a sense of accomplishment. So both of us learned something through that experience.\n\nDo you have any other advice for parents who are trying an integrated ABA/Floortime approach?\nI think that the use of videos--videotaping portions of sessions and being able to share those--are really valuable. Video enables you to see something, pause the tape, and talk about how you might approach a situation differently.  This is becoming more and more possible as video becomes more accessible. It isn't that commonplace now, but Dr. Lynn Koegel uses this technique at her clinic in Santa Barbara, and we try to use it whenever possible.\u00a0 Don't be afraid--ask your therapists for permission to videotape the sessions. Both sides will discover great new ways to reach the child. \n\nIf you have a question for Melissa, please leave a comment here or email her directly at: melissa [at] gatewaylg [dot] com.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.behavior.org/autism/", "http://www.floortime.org/", "http://www.autismjumpstart.org/conference", "http://www.christinaburkaba.com/ELvsNNP.htm", "http://www.education.ucsb.edu/autism/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2007/04/interview_with_.html", "title": "Integrating Floortime and ABA"},

We've been out for the day, and I have a pound and a half of halibut, a bag of artichokes and a bottle of white table wine in my lap: fixings for dinner. We're sandy and tired and feeling just fine.\n\nIsaac starts singing a little tune from the back seat: it's something he began on the way down and is now repeating, with variations, each day.  \"To-day we're going to their house,\" he sings, and then, \"To-day we're going back to somebody else's house.\"  He pauses briefly and segues into a childish a capella version of the Bee-Gees' \"Stayin' Alive,\" which J. taught him and is probably regretting about now.\n\nAfter a tough first two nights spent insisting hysterically that we go home, Isaac has finally settled in, and he wanders from room to room exploring, opening doors and drawers, stopping occasionally to perch on the couch with his friend.  But he's restless, and we've come to realize that we can't leave him alone here, even for a second.  His curiosity and his will are still stronger than his judgment, and so one of us follows him from room to room, removing objects from his hand, locking doors, admonishing and reminding and reinforcing.  It's a lot to ask of a five-year-old, him especially, and it wears at our sense of ease.\n\nSo, suitably stuffed with pancakes, fruit, milk and whatever else we have on hand, we whisk him out each morning: to Capitola, to Santa Cruz, to Carmel. He follows us with (mostly) good humor, though we both notice that he's more distractible here, more reliant on rituals to help ease his nervousness at each new place. We visit bathroom after bathroom to assure him that we can find a quiet one.  We take elevator rides, which he finds calming.  \n\nOne day, another woman and her young son come to visit, and Isaac's friend plays a vigorous game of forts with the boy, carefully constructing them from bolsters and throw pillows.  The two sit happily in their forts, and, after a while, Isaac sidles over.  We ask him if he wants to play, and there is a brief negotiation while we assure the boys that this interloper won't harm their construction. Finally, they assent, and Isaac takes his place among them, sitting carefully down, a serious expression on his face.  \n\nI notice a brief look of confusion: now that I'm here, what do I do?  I don't know how to facilitate this, and I'm too late anyway.  After a moment, he gets up and wanders into the kitchen.  The boys trash the forts and start climbing over their mountains of pillows, and Isaac is momentarily lured back into the game before wandering upstairs to look out the window and play with the shutters.\n\nThis is how it's going to be for a while, I realize, and this prospect of seeing him dip briefly into social play is both reassuring and terrifying: reassuring because it's a huge developmental step; terrifying because on the other side (present company excepted, my friends) there be monsters.\n\nWe're home now after a long, slow meander up Highway One.  He's fast asleep, exhausted, happy to be in a familiar bed, and J. and I are curled up on the couch eating bread and cheese, watching the Olympics.  \n\nI miss the ocean already.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/08/were-driving-on.html", "title": "At the waterline"},

There's the stimming, the anxiety, the moodiness, and then there are these moments of clarity when I can see him struggling to express new, more complex thoughts and feelings.\n\nThis weekend he had a few tantrums--more than usual (he's pretty even keeled, generally) but fewer than last weekend--and at a certain point we gave him his first official time-out.  He was angry, confused and unable to calm himself for a good long while.  Finally, he burst out with \"I want to play but I DON'T want to play!!\"  \n\nThen he demanded we end the time out so he could go play again, but I insisted that he apologize to his father first.  \"That's the rule, Isaac,\" I told him in what I hoped was a sufficiently firm and mature voice.  \"It's a BAD rule!\" he yelled back.\n\nSo that's why I use the Italian to explain this particular scenario.

She's on theycation too.  \n\nToday, however, I watched as he finally, fully seemed to grasp the meaning of weekends: how lovely they are, and how suddenly they are over.  \"I want to say home today,\" he announced this morning.  \"Sorry, Isaac, it's Monday.

{"date": "July 11, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\nBack when we were first trying to understand what was happening with Isaac; that is to say, when I was in what you might reasonably call denial, I read The Einstein Syndrome.  The idea was that some percentage of late-talking children--who have behaviors that mimic those of autism--don't actually have autism.  The book goes into some detail about Einstein's brain--about how the part of the brain that governs analytical ability was so overdeveloped that it crowded out the part of the brain that governs speech.  And so Einstein didn't speak until he was four.\n\nIt was, very possibly, a decent theory.  \nIt was, just as likely, pseudoscience.\nIt was, very definitely, an exercise in hairsplitting.\n\nI joined a \"late-talkers\" board and stayed up into the wee hours chatting online with like-minded parents. Our kids didn't have autism.  They were just late talkers. Analytical. Smart.  Good with numbers.  Never mind that they flapped, they toe-walked, they stimmed, they ignored their peers.  This was just a by-product of their GIANT BRAINS and their difficulty communicating.  Oh, and some sensory issues.\n\nI met one of these women when she came into town.  She brought her son, who, I realize now, was almost certainly on the spectrum.  She was very sweet, and drank tea in my dining room as her son watched videos in the front.  She played with Isaac.  She said he reminded her of her son at his age.  When she left, I went to bed and wrapped the blankets tight around me.\n\nNot long after, I bought Susan Senator's book.  It was time.\n\nI started this blog in February 2007.  The day after I started it, I left a note on the late talkers' board in case anyone wanted to read or comment.  The next time I tried to log onto the board, I couldn't.  My login was invalid.\n\nI sent a note to the moderator--that same woman who had visited my house a few months before.  I asked her if she wouldn't mind resetting my login, as it hadn't worked that morning.  She told me she'd revoked it because my blog was full of resources related to autism.  Why, she asked, would I want to be part of a late talkers board if my child had autism?\n\nWhy indeed.  \n\nI was so afraid of that word then, of everything it represented.  Starting this blog has been a process of making peace in my own way; not simply with my son's differences, but of what they meant.  Or what I thought they meant.  \n\nToday, J. took Isaac for pizza.  The server, J. said, looked like Ronaldinho.  Isaac watched him with interest as he prepared the pizza, served it, and then walked into the back of the store.  \"She's going into the back!\" Isaac told J excitedly.  \"Isaac, he's a boy. He just has a ponytail,\" J. responded in an embarrassed whisper. \"I want to go into the back,\" Isaac demanded, and then, after a moment, \"We can't go into the back.  We don't work here.\"\n\nJ allowed that that was true. Isaac took a few more bites of pizza, paused, and leaned into J conspiratorially.  \"Let's work here!\" he suggested slyly.\n\nI am amazed, ashamed even, when I remember how hard it was to accept Isaac's diagnosis.  \"It gets better,\" people would tell me, and in my grief and confusion, I discounted what they said. I thought that meant they had settled for reduced expectations, for a sad, constrained sort of life. I thought they were humoring me, so I would be able, like them, to wake up each morning and put one foot in front of the other.\n\nBut when I think about what autism has really come to mean in our lives, about everything we've learned, I feel a sort of gratitude. For pancake breakfasts, and kisses, and silly games, for sly comments and fart jokes and the simple pleasure of his company.\n\nI don't mean to candy-coat it.  It's not always easy, and it's tougher for some than for others.  But there is joy too, and peace, and grace.\n\nDon't be afraid.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://books.google.com/books?id=680LYsUXPZAC&dq=einstein+syndromw&pg=PP1&ots=0BdDDzmREy&sig=YC96ooCV7YFg8w_CYPOmvq7gTJs&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result", "http://susansenator.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronaldinho"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/07/i-have-a-confes.html", "title": "I have a confession to make"},

When we got there, it was about half-full.  The kids arrived leisurely; they piled their backpacks on the bench and wandered over to the swings, the monkeybars, the slide.  Isaac led me in like he owned the place; funny to be somewhere for the first time and know that it was already such a familiar place for him.  He greeted his teachers and ran off to the swings. \"Bye, Mommy!\" he called out, waving.\n\nWe didn't know how he'd do at summer camp; it's an outdoor program and it meets at different places nearly every day.  Did we forget that transitions are hard?  Did he?  It's been, for the most part (dare I say it?) a breeze. \n\n*\nWe've been working on simple ways to incorporate Isaac into the daily activities around the house: loading the dryer, putting his plates in the sink; dropping his pajamas into the hamper.  Today, while I was straightening up, I absentmindedly asked him to throw some paper into the recycling.  \n\n\"Where's the recycling?\" he asked.\n\nSuch an ordinary morning, such an ordinary question, such extraordinary progress.  \n\nNext up, kindergarten.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/07/and-you-may-ask.html", "title": "And you may ask yourself...well...how did I get here?"},

June is famously cold, July and August are unpredictable and September is usually warm, sunny and lovely.  \n\nAll summer, we drove up and down the hills as freezing tourists in hastily-bought sweatshirts passed by, clinging to cable-cars for dear life.  Isaac grew, he read his first book, he got his first relatively successful haircut, he handled the dentist, the doctor and the developmental optometrist with aplomb.  And there was more perseveration, more language, more affection and playfulness, more rigidity, more maturity and more obsessive-compulsive behavior.  \n\nHis emerging sense of independence--of the desire to understand and try to control his environment--means that we have more compulsiveness to--what?  Manage?  Endure?  Gently redirect?  If only.  Like so much in our world, it's good (desire for independence) and hard too (obsessive, sometimes even frantic).\n\nAnd then there's school, and with it a sensory bombardment that is at times excruciating for him.  He comes home exhausted, crabby, hyper, starving.  He's immovable or he's bouncing off the walls. He wakes up in the morning saying, \"No recess.  I don't want to go to recess.\"  I ask him why, and it's so obvious it hurts: too. much. noise.  No structure, though he doesn't verbalize that.  Children running past him, screaming. \n\nHow exactly is this supposed to be fun?\n\nWe've arranged for more support for after care.  We're hoping to get more support for the transition times: lunch, recess.  He seems to like his teacher and is already mentioning one of the kids.\n\nIt's Sunday, and after a low-key day yesterday followed by twelve hours of sleep, he's happy, relaxed, playful and silly. He and his dad are playing a game of smoosh (in which they smoosh each other with pillows) as I tap this out on the bed. \n\nI am hoping that we'll find our groove.  After two years of consistency and support, we're out there, and there's no going back.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/09/kindergarten-we.html", "title": "Kindergarten, week two: let's go crazy!

Isaac clung to me, his head pressed tight against my belly. \"I don't want to go in,\" he said, looking up, the corners of his mouth turning downward, tears welling.\"I know, sweetie, I know. Mondays are hard.\" And they are, for all the obvious reasons, and some not so obvious.It's the rhythm of things, you see. \u00a0It's the rhythm of waking on the weekends, of playing, of spending a full half hour just looking at each other. Few words, lots of expression, smiles, the occasional growl.I reach over lazily to tickle him, and his eyes lock onto mine, a grin spreading across his face. \u00a0\"That look, right there!\" a therapist said to us early on. \"That's what you want when he looks at you--that expression of total connection, total absorption.\"Well, yes.Time moves very slowly here on the weekends; we wake, I make pancakes and coffee, we read and wrestle, Isaac plays a few games of Wii Bowling with his dad, followed by a meltdown of tragic proportions when we deny him a fourth (okay, a fifth) game. He bowls a 59, a 61, a 71, moving through the controls with confidence. \u00a0In the last game, he makes two spares. \u00a0I watch as every so often he crosses his midline, and I exhale a soft little breath.All these things we watch. All these things we monitor and read like damp tea leaves in a porcelain cup. An accumulation of moments, synapses firing, experiences, feelings, neural pathways paved and repaved.No wonder Mondays come hard and fast, an abrupt gear change, and we all have trouble with the transition. But as much as I love to have him near me, to move in weekend time and focus on the precise little details of our day, I know it's not sustainable. He needs Monday. He needs to move out into the world, with its noises and smells and bustle, its schedules and inconveniences and daily pressures.\u00a0And so, reluctantly, I kneel down, take his hand in mine, and walk with him into the classroom.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/12/we-stood-outside-the-classroom-doors-frazzled-and-late-isaac-clung-to-me-his-head-pressed-tight-against-my-belly-i-don.html", "title": "And here we are again"},

{"date": "December 15, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\r\n I got a note from Ana, Isaac's new afternoon nanny, today. She told me that he was at the playground playing with a toy car when another boy came and tried to take it away from him. \u00a0\"I was here first,\" Isaac said.I was here first.I can't think of those words without tearing up, without taking an inventory of everything that went into that seemingly ordinary phrase:The hours of speech therapy, working on pronouns and ordinal numbers;The social facilitation, learning how to pay attention to other children and address them directly;The emerging sense of self to hold onto that car and not simply give it up to avoid confrontation;The self-control to answer simply and clearly, rather than losing his cool.I was here first.If you ever doubted that the hard-won victories of autism are sweeter, just imagine the quiet drama of that little exchange: one boy playing, another making a move on his toy; the brief confrontation, the readjustment and shift to a new object of desire. For most children, it's hardly worthy of mention. \u00a0It comes naturally. \u00a0It happens dozens of times per day. It's easy.Yeah, right.\u00a0It's easy like it's easy to outswim Michael Phelps; after all, it's just swimming, right? Jump in the water, kick, paddle, get to the other side; anyone can do it. \u00a0But behind that seemingly effortless grace lie hours of work, an accumulation of muscle memory and tiny, interdependent skills brought together over time into one fluid, perfect movement.First we pray that our kids will be able to learn social skills: when to say hi, when to say bye, when to offer another kid a toy. Then we pray that they can repeat those skills, generalize them to multiple situations. Then (most difficult of all) we hope that, one day, they'll be able to do it without fanfare--to make it look so easy that no one notices.It's something to aspire to, isn't it, the quiet joy of ordinary moments?\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/12/i-was-here-first.html", "title": "I was here first"},
{"date": "September 03, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tStephen Jay Gould theorized that rather than Darwin's idea of a slow, gradual process, evolution is actually characterized by periods of inertia, followed by (relatively) sudden bursts of intense activity.  He called it \"punctuated equilibrium.\" When I look at my son, at the ways that his mind and body continue to grow, it makes a kind of intuitive sense.  \n\nIt's sort of like this: blahblahblahblah [START TO READ] blahblahblah [GROW AN INCH IN LIKE A DAY] blahblahblah ALL OF A SUDDEN DECIDE HAIRCUTS ARE OKAY.  And so on.\n\nOf course I know it's not really sudden activity: all the gears have been in motion, and lots of things are happening, above and below the surface, before we see that emerging skill.  \n\nLet's consider the haircut.  \n\nA while back, I started chronicling Isaac's haircut experiences because, like many kids on the spectrum (as well as some canny adults), having a very large and strange person repeatedly lunge at you with scissors is terrifying.  \n\nAdd in the surprise and sensory impact of being sprayed with water, the snick-snick of the scissors near your head, the itchy sensation of hair falling on your neck and down your shirt, and it's pretty intolerable.\n\nSo we went through a long period of haircut rejection, and the poor lady at the kids' barber shop did the best she could with a writhing, screaming charge.  \n\nWe tried social stories, and weaving haircut play into Isaac's therapy sessions.  We tried waiting it out in front of the barber shop, while kids filed calmly in around us.  We tried trimming him at home (Child Protective Services, Style Division, nearly paid a visit).  We tried diversions (videos, books, cameras, whatever).  Ultimately, we just gutted it out. \n\nUntil this summer. \n\nRather than waiting until haircut time to broach the subject, we just started talking about hair every so often: about how Daddy needed a haircut, about how mommy was going to get her hair cut, about how, in a few weeks time, he'd need one too.\n\n\"No haircut,\" he'd remind us. \n\nAnd then, suddenly, he decided he was ready. \"I want a quiet, soft haircut,\" he told me the other day.  \"Not a loud, hard haircut.\" \n\n\"Okay, Isaac,\" I answered.  \"When we get there, you can tell the lady what you want.\"\n\nAnd he did, in barely a whisper, after I prompted him. This time involved no squirming, no tears, no drama.  He chose his chair, he let the lady put a bib on him, he sat and allowed his hair to be cut.\n\nSo my suggestion, for whatever it's worth: PECS, social stories, they're a starting point.  But we've found that just remembering to talk about things, even if we're not sure how much he's taking in, has made such a difference.  \n\nSometimes it's so gradual that it doesn't even feel like progress.

If you've not heard of her, she is the founder of the Friend 2 Friend Social Learning Society in Vancouver, British Columbia. She's speaking at the Autism Social Connections conference in San Francisco today. \r\n\r\nHeather has three kids, one of which, Ian, has autism. When Ian was small, she read one of Pamela Wolfberg's books and was captivated by the idea of developing a program to demystify autism and help children with autism learn social skills from their typically developing peers (and, as it turns out, vice versa).\r\n\r\nToday the Friend 2 Friend society has done over 1,700 autism demystification programs.\u00a0The model seeks to enhance reciprocal social interaction. Says Heather,\"the key to these friendship between children on the autism spectrum and their peers is to foster understanding, acceptance and empathy in an age-appropriate and sensitive manner.\"\u00a0Here are a few tenets of the model.Demystication is a process that supports a general understanding of autism. A big part of demystification is\u00a0\"normalizing\" behaviors such as hand-flapping or toe-walking by explaining it in a personal context. Here's an example: Heather likes twirl her hair. She does this when she's stuck in traffic. When she's late, she does it faster. \u00a0It doesn't get her where she's going, but it makes her feel better. We all have things that we do: toe tap, hair twirl, chew a pencil eraser--whatever--when we want to calm our bodies and our minds.So the process of normalization is to model (demonstrate the behavior), label it, explain it and, in this way, dissolve the boundaries that divide people with disability or difference from those without. \u00a0Another tenet is that, just because children with autism may have language processing difficulties, it doesn't mean they're not understanding what you say when you talk about them. So Heather's rule is this:\u00a0if they can't be part of the conversation, they shouldn't be hearing the conversation: it's a question of respect.Not about me, without me.So many of us grew up not knowing kids with special needs, and the idea of opening up the conversation--of asking about difference--seems almost painfully wrong. \"It's not polite to stare,\" I was told as a child, and I'm sure you were too. But Heather's belief is that asking is important, because it opens up the conversation, which leads to understanding, accepting, and ultimately, friendship.For more on the Friend 2 Friend Social Learning Society, check out the website here.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.friend2friendsociety.org/about/team.php", "http://www.friend2friendsociety.org/about/kudos.php", "http://www.autismsocialconnection.org/ASCWebsite/asc/ASCConference2008.html", "http://www.autisminstitute.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Imagination-Children-Autism-Special-Education/dp/080773814X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1228511819&sr=8-2", "http://www.friend2friendsociety.org/index.php"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/12/demystifying-autism-friend-2-friend-social-learning.html", "title": "Demystifying Autism: Friend 2 Friend Social Learning"},

The heat kicks in with a soft whoosh.  It's a rare moment of calm.\n\nI took Isaac to dinner tonight, while J. went to a colleague's retirement party at school.  We sat at the Pac-Man table, munching chicken (for him), a burger (for me) and fries (for both of us).  At times like this, I feel a heightened sense of awareness of who we are: a young boy and his mother out for a meal together.  It feels both reassuringly normal, and slightly momentous: will he slip?  Will there be a tantrum?  Or will we sit companionably, Isaac sneaking fries off my plate when he thinks I'm not looking?  I wanted the older couple at the next table to notice him, to comment on his near-perfect manners: to see what's under the waterline and tell me that we're going to be okay.\n  \nI don't know why, but it seemed important tonight somehow.\n\nIsaac's eyes welled with tears this morning as I dropped him at school.  Even now, when most children are well past the separation anxiety, I can feel his tug of uncertainty as I pull away for the day.  Can't it just be like this, me sitting in your lap, you smoothing my hair and telling me silly stories?  Do you have to go to work?  Won't you just take me home, where we can play and nap and shut out the world together?\n\nIt's almost eerie.  I remember that feeling as a child: the sense that the rigor of daily life was just too much sometimes: the discipline of up, shower, dress, eat, pack lunch, go, sit, sit, recess, sit, eat, sit, sit, home, play, dinner, dishes, bed--too complicated and deeply, deeply unfair.  I feel that way still.\n\nAnd it makes me wonder about the true impact of Isaac's challenges: whether, as he grows older and builds his capacity to cope with the barrage of input that comes at him from all sides, he'll emerge even more, become even more expressive, loosen up and start to communicate more fluidly and with less anxiety.  I don't know.  I hope so. The milestones are coming, even if sometimes they appear as if in a funhouse mirror.\n\nTomorrow we have a few plans.  We'll take it easy.  We are trying so hard not to limit our life, not to set too many tight boundaries, even as we vow not to bombard him.  The line shifts daily, even hourly.\n\nWe pick our way over the path, sliding on the gravel, avoiding the larger roots, an occasional stumble, an occasional sharp pebble in the shoe.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/05/friday-night-an.html", "title": "Friday night and the gang's all here"},

I go underground and need to, I don't know, disappear, get some perspective, hibernate.

Then Daddy will pick you up and you can ride the elevators with him later.\"  \n\n\"I want to go on the elevator NOW!!!\" he wailed, his body a ball of tensed, vibrating muscle.  \n\n\"Sweetie, I know you are upset and want to go on the elevator now.  But it's a school day.\"  \n\n\"It's an ELEVATOR day!!!\"\n\n\"You can do this,\" I responded, my voice a soft whisper in his ear, urging him to listen to my tone, if not my words.\n\n\"I CANNOT!!! I CAN'T!!!\" he wailed.\n\nI felt hot tears spring to my eyes.  Don't overthink this, I thought.  Just...don't.  But I couldn't push it from my mind.  He's never said that before.  And I wondered whether he's formulated this thought to himself before: I can't do this.\n\nIt broke my heart.\n\nLater, after I had severely compromised my \"model mom\" status with some ill-timed yelling and at least one involuntary F-bomb (ugh!), I finally got him through the school door and, urged by the teachers, left. My clothes in a sweat-soaked mess, my hair blown wild by the wind, I sat in my car and just listened for a moment to the blood pulse-pounding in my ears.\n\nDon't overthink this, I thought.  It's just a tantrum.  It's not prophecy.  It's not Shakespearean foreshadowing of some horrible thing that will happen in Act III, just as we're thinking we're out of the woods.  Know it for what it is: a very overwhelmed, very angry, very frustrated four-year-old boy.\n\nBut I couldn't shake it.  Not then.  \n\nAn hour or so later, my phone rang.  \"He's fine now.  He's having milk and cookies in the kitchen, and he's telling us that he's sad that you said goodbye, but that Daddy will pick him up later.\"\n\nI think he bounced back faster than I did, the little stinker.\n\n*\nI don't know about you, but I don't think I can take any more studies revealing that maternal mental illness, vaccines, television, cell phones, or, who knows, hearing the collected works of Andrew Lloyd Webber in utero (though that last wouldn't surprise me) causes autism.  I just can't.  Can we call a truce for a while?  Please?\n\nIn the meantime, I think I just need to read Emily every time a new study comes out, so I can be sure my science comes pre-analyzed and pre-debunked by a trusted source.  \n\n[Oh, and random factoid: a casual Google search tonight of the terms \"autism cause\" returned a mere 619,000 entries, dwarfed by the whopping 112,000,000 returned for a search of \"Britney Spears.\"  So don't even begin to tell me what that says about our culture's priorities.]\n\n*\nFinally, and without too many details, we had our very first actually successful playdate yesterday, by which I mean that Isaac met a new child and new parents in a new house, played with the boy (a little), laughed with him and seemed to enjoy himself--for quite a sustained period.  It helped that the parents were delightful, the boy was gentle and tolerant and funny and sweet, he had exciting toys, and there were plenty of opportunities for breaks when Isaac needed them.  We were genuinely sorry to leave, and Isaac remarked in his bath last night that he wanted to go back to their house.  As did we.\n\nWow.  Don't want to jinx it, but it seems...promising.\n\nPlease be patient with me.  I'll try to keep the tumbleweed to a minimum this week.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://daisymayfattypants.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/05/a-long-spiky-we.html", "title": "Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds"},

Hoo Hoo,\" it would call night after night, familiar music through my bedroom window.\u00a0Sometimes I would hear coyotes keening through the brush. One would start to yowl, then the others would join in and--just as suddenly--fall silent.\u00a0It was peaceful in my bedroom, at least on the nights that I couldn't hear my parents arguing. Our house was at the end of a cul-de-sac, butting up against the scrubby hillside and all its rightful inhabitants. Every day at around dusk a squirrel would come down the hill and drink from our pool, his tail twitching anxiously at the slightest breeze. Sometimes we'd find the odd garden snake on the front steps. Once we found a baby rattler, and, not long after, a large\u00a0hairy\u00a0black tarantula making its leisurely way through the ivy.It was wild and utterly ordinary, and it's the image I conjure when I'm looking for a sense of peace, my inner compass.*J. and I made the decision to raise Isaac in the city early on. Both kids of the suburbs, we loved the idea of being able to walk anywhere from our front door, or hop on the bus at a moment's notice. We loved the diversity, the parks, the energy of city life, the variety of things to do.But I can't help feeling a little melancholy that the sounds that soothed me as a chid--the hum of wildlife going about its daily business--are not available to him. Instead he falls asleep to the neighbors' conversation on the deck below, to diesel buses and police cars and babies crying and dogs barking in the distance.\u00a0*We recently began introducing the concept of peacefulness to Isaac. His understanding of emotions grows day by day; yesterday, he informed me solemnly, \"I was grouchy before, but now I feel happy.\" And so beyond happiness--a state that he guards intensely--lie other more nuanced feelings: excitement, fear, worry, surprise, and now, peacefulness.\"Do you want me to rub your back?\" I asked him not long ago as we completed our nightly bedtime ritual. \"Yes,\" he whispered, his face buried in the sheets. \u00a0I rubbed his back in slow circles, whispering to him, and told him that this was what peaceful feels like: when your breathing is slow, and your voice is low, and your muscles feel loose and heavy as you drift closer to sleep.\"Do you feel peaceful now?\" I asked, my voice a whisper. \"Yes,\" he said, and closed his eyes.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2009/02/peaceful.html", "title": "Peaceful"},

Later, J. reminded me how developmentally \"good\" this is, and he was right.\u00a0We're also a little flummoxed by the way he's learning language. In some ways we can see him applying the linguistic rules he's learned: \"I bringed my car outside,\" he proudly announced to J. this morning, and there was a brief discussion of irregular verbs. \"It doesn't make any sense,\" J. said, \"but that's how it works.\"\u00a0And that's our lesson for today: there's a lot that doesn't make any sense, or has its own peculiar logic, and maybe, if we're lucky, will be revealed one day.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2009/03/irregular-verbs.html", "title": "Irregular verbs"},

The first time, we rushed him to the emergency room in a panic and watched helplessly as he vomited the medicine the doctor administered to reduce the inflammation in his tiny trachea.\r\nBy the second time, we were veterans. We asked for the shot first, and spent hours crouched in the steamy bathroom as he barked and strained for air.\u00a0\r\nBy the third time, he was wise to the drill and screamed from the moment we entered Urgent Care.

{"date": "March 15, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\r\n The two-year anniversary of this blog was about a month ago, and it passed me by entirely. But I found myself thinking about it this morning as I watched Isaac play happily with Mario Kart on the Wii. \u00a0We've come a long way. \u00a0A few mile markers:- He can play independently now, at least for a while- His language has exploded. It's still not at age level, and it can be a bit eccentric at times, but it's miles ahead of where he was- He can play interactively with us for a good long time- He's showing interest in other kids; talking about them, trying what they do, even responding and playing sometimesYesterday, while trying to con us out of too much snack, he explained to us that \"if I eat too many crackers, my tummy will be disappointed.\" \u00a0Indeed.And where it all leads is anybody's guess.*You know that Chinese proverb (or maybe it's a curse?): \"may you live in interesting times\"? Let's say we are in an \"interesting\" behavioral phase. \u00a0One moment, Isaac is reflective (\"I feel upset because I don't want to go to school\"). \u00a0The next moment he is in a full-scale red-alert tantrum because he wants to go into the girl's bathroom. \u00a0He's clearly able to reason and understand consequences, but sometimes the impulses are just too strong for him to bear. Is it the pressure we exert as parents? Or is it more of an internal battle?Jordan was musing a few weeks ago about the difficulty in discerning \"typical,\" age-appropriate behavior from what we all affectionately refer to as \"spectrum stuff.\" \u00a0She's a speech and language pathologist (ie a speech therapist) and the mother of two typically-developing kids, but her practice consists of a lot of kids on the spectrum.\u00a0She says:\"One of my professional responsibilities has been to help parents sort out which of their child\u2019s behaviors are 'typical,' i.e., often occurring in the development of neurotypical kids, and which are more atypical.\u00a0 To be honest, this isn\u2019t a conversation I ever seek out, but it does come up fairly often when parents attribute very typical things as 'disordered' or 'autistic' and then I step in with some developmental information that generally provides a sense of relief to worried parents.\"She had a question about one of her sons, and a friend pointed her to a couple of books entitled, Your-Eight-Year-Old-Outgoing and Your Four-Year-Old: Wild and Wonderful\u00a0by Louse Bates Ames, Ph.D. of the Gesell Institute of Human Development.Despite the age of the books (they were originally written in the 70s), Jordan found the eight-year-old version useful. \u00a0Now let me just say right now that since Isaac's diagnosis (when it became clear that we were going to need another map entirely) I have fled from any book that purports to explain typical child development.But I trust Jordan and it had been a long time, so I thought I'd check out the five-year-old version.\u00a0The title? \u00a0Your Five-Year-Old: Sunny and Serene.\u00a0Uh, not so much.\u00a0Here's an excerpt:\"In his determination to do everything just right, he may ask permission for even the simplest thing and will then beam with pleasure as his mother smiles and says, 'Yes, you may have an apple, dear.'\"\r\nWrong and wrong. \u00a0But I kept reading until I got to the section on age five-and-a-half to six (Isaac is 5 1/2) and nearly choked on this bit:\"Not yet a full-fledged Six, nevertheless the child of five-and -a-half shows an all-too-great readiness to disobey, to go against what is asked or expected of him. And he doesn't always do this gently. \"Brash\" and \"combative\" are the adjectives that mothers use in describing this child, and all with good reason.\"And this:\"Five-and-a-half is characteristially hesitant, dawdlng, indecisive--or at the opposite extreme, overdemanding and explosive.\"Well hellllloooo, gorgeous.Any of you with spectrum kids will know this--aloofness, rage, anxiety, clinginess--all these things can look downright pathological when you have a child with a diagnosed difference. It's tempting to put any extreme behavior into that bucket. But typical kids? They do weird stuff too. They dawdle, they demand, they retreat, they explode.Back before we were sure of a diagnosis, we used to wish we had a \"control child\" that we could compare against: is this normal? Or is it spectrum? But now we know: we'll never really know.

The truth is, there is a lot I can't write about right now; not because it's so dramatic or difficult (though sometimes it feels that way) but because I need some time to process things. \u00a0We are at a kind of crossroads once again.It was a rough Saturday and a lovely Sunday, which, by the way, is a kind of pattern over here. \u00a0I suspect that it's because J. and I tend to be tired out from the week, and thus sometimes a little short on patience on Saturdays, while Isaac is in the same boat. His solution: act out, and then act out some more. Ours? \u00a0I wish I knew.But after an afternoon of screeching in the tiny Chinese dumpling house (and I mean tiny: five tables) and lying down on the street, sobbing, and refusing to get in the car, he finally agreed to go home, eat dinner and take his bath, which made for a much happier (and cleaner) boy. \u00a0And today we had a lovely morning.\u00a0Lately, Isaac loves to look at family photos, so we've added some snapshots of classmates from the past years. We sat on an overstuffed chair in his room and he showed me who everyone was. \"Who's this?\" I asked, pointing to a dark-haired boy. \"That's Andrew,\" he responded. \"And who's this,\" I said, pointing to a sandy haired boy to his left. \"That's Andrew!\" Isaac answered, grinning.\"Andrew?\" Are ALL of the kids in your class named Andrew? \u00a0Andrew, Andrew, Andrew, Andrew and ANDREW?!?\" \u00a0He let out a snort of laughter. \u00a0\"Again!\" he demanded. \u00a0And so I complied, and he sipped his milk and ate bites of pancake, and he was happy and at ease.*Later, I asked him why he'd been upset the day before. \"Because I wanted to go on the elevator.\" \u00a0He's processing his feelings--so good--and yet we are a little worried about this special interest of his: his obsession with elevators seems so narrow, and it feels lately as if it is filling more and more of his time.The funny thing is that since his diagnosis, I always wanted Isaac to develop a special interest. \u00a0I think I sort of half-consciously believed that if he had a special interest that would mean he's more Aspergian, and if more Aspergian, then...what? \u00a0But his early language delay and his continued challenges with pragmatic language complicate things quite a bit. \u00a0It's time for a new evaluation to look at all of it: the social, the emotional, the cognitive, the communicative. \u00a0He's had incredible gains, it's true, but we just cannot tell whether his recent anxiety and increased rigidity are a product of stress, or something deeper.If. And. But.\u00a0It makes my brain hurt to think about it.And so the calm predictability of elevators, with their neat rows of buttons, their reliable routes, their confined space and muted sounds and minimal decoration, yes. They seem soothing, somehow, and I can understand their allure.Especially as, humming to myself, I cut vegetables in too-neat rows for dinner.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2009/01/its-been-a-rocky-month-my-apologies-for-being-so-inconsistent-the-truth-is-there-is-a-lot-i-cant-write-about-right-now-no.html", "title": "Special interests"},

He ignored me and kept reading, his attention fixed on the book. \u00a0\"Isaac, look at me,\" I said, my voice a little louder than before. He looked me in the eye. \"Why is Trixie so upset?\" I asked again. \"Because she lost her Knuffle Bunny,\" he replied calmly, and went back to reading. \u00a0*I first heard about the Ann Bauer article on from some friends on Twitter. \"Sick to my stomach,\" one wrote, \"Shaking,\" and I clicked over to see what everyone was talking about. \u00a0\"For years I thought of his autism as beautiful and mysterious. But when he turned unspeakably violent, I had to question everything I knew,\" read the introduction, and I felt a heavy dread gather in my stomach.Let me get this straight, so there is no misunderstanding.\u00a0Autism is nothing if not mysterious, and it is as impossible for me to untangle my son's autism from who he is as it would be to imagine him a girl, or a teenager, or your child, or anyone other than he is now at nearly six years old. I do think his autism is beautiful because it's part of who he is, how he appreciates a pratfall, loves the music of words, devours books, tenderly kisses his stuffed bunny before bed.And despite the fact that he's gentle and happy and bright, I would be lying if I told you I didn't wonder sometimes where this all will lead, and if he'll be okay. \u00a0I'm his mom. \u00a0It's my job.Honestly, though, I worry less about him than I do about you. Well, probably not you exactly, because you're here and you're reading and, if this isn't your first visit, you know a little about our story.I worry about the world, and people's conflicted and often hostile reactions to autism. Dennis Leary, are you listening? \u00a0I worry because, if you read the comments to Ann Bauer's story, they start off compassionately, and then understandably begin to question, and then, slowly veer into judgment.

Even if it makes us sick to go to those dark places because that's what happens to other people who (we would like to believe, wouldn't we?) somehow\u00a0deserve it.We owe it to our kids--and to the adults on the spectrum who deserve our understanding and respect--to be better than that.We need to be better than that. \u00a0We need to be BETTER THAN THAT.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Knuffle-Bunny-Cautionary-Ribbon-Picture/dp/0786818700", "http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2009/03/26/bauer_autism/index.html", "http://", "http://www.salon.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2009/03/some-dark-places-and-a-call-to-action.html", "title": "Some dark places, and a call to action"},

It does look like cereal.\" \u00a0\"Yeah,\" he answered softly, and snuggled in a little closer.Finally I urged him into the building, a good forty minutes after we'd arrived. He dawdled by the library for a while and then reluctantly followed me down the hall. We stood there silently as he decided his next move. And then, without any warning at all, he darted into the classroom and joined the other kids.I walked back to the car, and all I could think was how unfair it is that the most ordinary things can be so excruciating for him, and how blessed he is that even in the throes of his most difficult moments, he can stop to appreciate the language of things, the poetry in a piece of velcro.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2009/01/l.html", "title": "Looks Like Cereal "},
{"date": "January 26, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tWay back when we were first wading through therapies and diagnoses and endlessly picking little laminated icons off the floor, I remember thinking how overwhelmed and exhausted we felt every time someone suggested something new.\u00a0PECS never sat well with us, in retrospect, I think, because so many of Isaac's auditory processing challenges are situational. That is to say, his receptive language is fine at home and in quiet places, while he has a much harder time in loud, chaotic environments or when he's upset. So while it may have been essential for the classroom, it usually felt unnatural--and like overkill--at home.The truth is we resisted a lot of suggestions at first but ended up trying just about everything sooner or later. I remember saying snidely to J. one day that developmental pediatricians should hand out two things to newly-diagnosed parents on the way out of the office: a prescription for antidepressants and a lamination machine.Because if you are a parent of the child on the spectrum, there is only one absolute truth: everything having to do with autism must be laminated.\u00a0\u00a0Social stories, while they seemed really smart in theory, seemed overwhelming in practice. Find images that your child can relate to, add text to them, bind them together and...what? \u00a0A book every time we need to do something new? It's enough to make you want to stay inside all day and bolt the door.We're way past that now, and I have enough perspective to see that, without really noticing, we now weave social stories into pretty much everything we do. Isaac loves and responds to them, and we rarely if ever need pictures anymore to reinforce the story. \u00a0He likes to hear them, embroider them, add silly variations. He asks for them when he's upset or nervous or excited, and he sometimes even tells them himself. It's as natural as conversation, if conversation were, in fact, natural.\u00a0But there's another piece here too. Isaac loves our family photo albums. When he was a baby, I remember seeing a craft project in one of the parenting magazines (inspiring in that Martha Stewart way: impressive, while leaving you with the vague sense that you have failed as a parent, even before you've started). It involved making a mobile out of photos so your little darling could go to sleep with the faces of beloved family members dangling overhead. I never made that mobile, but I did go out and get a bunch of little brag books, which I brought to work in the days after I returned to work to try to retain some continuity with my new, and still unfamiliar, mother self.Isaac has discovered and fallen in love with these books, and he takes great pleasure in pointing out the pictures of \"Baby Isaac,\" Mommy, Daddy, and his grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. To this we have added pictures from school for a bit of social reinforcement.\"Who's this?\" I asked the other day as we looked at a picture from last year's preschool class. \"That's Andrew!\" he told me excitedly. \"And this?\" I said, pointing to another child. \"That's Andrew!\"\"Really, Isaac,\" I asked. \"Are ALL the kids in your class named Andrew?\" I pointed to each one in turn. \"Andrew, Andrew, Andrew, Andrew and Andrew?\"He laughed so hard he started to hiccup, and since then he has insisted that we refer to him as Andrew.\u00a0\"Isaac, it's time for bed,\" I said tonight.\"ANDREW it's time for bed,\" he replied calmly, grinning at me sidelong: his father's grin.So I complied, marveling at how a simple story about going to school has meandered its way into a game of pretend, and how right it is that he is now becoming interested in exploring the meanings of routine and friendship and family and identity.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.pecs.com/", "http://www.thegraycenter.org/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2009/01/bring-on-the-andrews.html", "title": "Bring on the Andrews!"},

It's constant sensory bombardment--at school, where he struggles and comes home exhausted, outside; where he's always prey to unexpected noises; even at home sometimes when the washing machine buzzes or the microwave beeps its three final beeps.\n\nThis afternoon, we snuggled on the sofa and watched \"Harold and the Purple Crayon,\" followed by a game of dress-up like Daddy (\"I want to see in the mirror!\" he squawked, and bolted down the hall.)

I care that they're meaningful.\n\nI wonder a lot about attention lately.  Mine (sometimes hard to corral, pulled in so many directions). My husband's (mature and focused, a solid barometer).

{"date": "December 22, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\r\n Sometimes, despite all planning to the contrary, despite weeks of social stories and preparation, it all goes south. We were fine until boarding, more or less. After all, Isaac has flown what? Ten round-trips to New York? A few to LA? The kid has logged more miles in his five years than a lot of adults I know. Maybe it was the alarm that went off in security. Or the fact that we denied him an elevator ride at Gate A1 in favor of the one closer to our departure gate. Or maybe it was the sight of the crowd, jostling into a cold and noisy jetway.I don't know. Idon'tknowIdon'tknowIdon'tknowIdon'tknow.The flight crew and security staff were wonderful. After stories like this and this and this I've come to prepare myself for callousness, even outright hostility from the real world, and the real world obliges with its usual motley assortment of responses: sweet, self-righteous, ignorant, outright weird. It was maybe twenty minutes total. Isaac screamed and cried on the jetway, so much so that a few members of the flight crew came out to see if they could help. Given the fact that the plane was entirely boarded by that point, given everything, really, they were unfailingly polite and helpful. And I should say: not in a \"oooh this-is-inconvenient-but-we-had-mandatory-sensitivity-training-after-that-CNN-story-so we'll-smile-a-lot-until-these-horrible-people-go-away\" kind of way, but in a crisp, unobtrusive, human way. I was very, very grateful for that. however it came about.Finally they had to close the plane, and J., Isaac and I went back to the gate to see if we could board a later flight. \"Are you scared?\" he asked me later that night. \"Yeah of course,\" I said. But I wasn't ready to talk about what it could mean. Not yet, anyway.We spent eight hours in the airport Saturday (no more seats to be had), and another four or so on Sunday, waiting for our delayed second flight. Isaac was generally calm, but at the final moment he balked. I had told J. that if this happened again, he should just go, and I would take our boy home. Reluctantly, he handed me Isaac's jacket and boarding pass and boarded the plane alone.I spent another ten minutes trying to convince Isaac to get on the plane with me. We got as far as the jetway, but by this point he was completely hysterical.\"It's too much!\" he cried, tears streaming down his face. \"It's too much noise! I want to go home!\" Suddenly I couldn't do it anymore. As much as our family trips mean to me, to all of us, I just couldn't. And in the back of my mind, I thought wow. Nice asking.We walked silently back through the terminal, hand in hand, through the rain to the shuttle bus, into the car, and drove home to the sound of the wind and the wipers. When we got home, I made him dinner, drew him a bath, got him ready for bed, and lay down next to him as he, and then I, dropped off to sleep.We awoke this morning to the first wisps of silver light peeking through the window shades. \"\"It's still pretty dark,\" he observed, hopping out of bed in search of milk.We're going to have to look into this anxiety. It worries me terribly that he lives with such intense fears, and I only hope that it's a phase rather than a hint at something darker to come. But maybe this is an unexpected gift as well: ten days together, just the two of us. Time to go to the playground, bake cookies, see some friends. Time to reconnect and to rest.This autism thing.

Worry about the world (big, macro, financial, political) and worry about the personal (how will we reset Isaac's sleep routine?  Is he getting enough vitamins? Does he understand that it really hurts when he pulls my hair, even if he's just playing?)  And school, school, always school.\n\nIt's a mess, all of it, the accumulation of a million little decisions:  some ours, some the nation's, some of genetics and environment and pure, hellish chaos.\n\nWhy is it that Isaac is easing off the elevators as he becomes even more obsessed with potties?  Why is it that he can't stand to see an open window lately? And how is it that he can reason so exquisitely at times, and not at all at others?\n\nWe were watching Thomas the Tank Engine the other day, and Gordon was cross.  \"Isaac, do you know what cross means?\" I asked casually as I smoothed lotion on his face.  \"Cross means mad,\" he replied easily.

We waited outside the classroom while the teacher finished up a meeting.  Finally we went inside, and moments later, the kids arrived.  \n\n\"Isaac, why don't you say hi to the kids when they come in,\" I suggested gently.\n\n\"That's Joseph's dad,\" he informed me, looking at a man shepherding his son into the room.

And the pace of things--it's a lot for him to manage.\n\nSometimes the other children help him: one little girl likes to take his hand when we walk into class and lead him to his spot on the rug for circle time.

For one thing, there was a cubic ton of swag (which I wrote about here) and a huge emphasis on consumer brands (K-Y Jelly, Graco, Weight Watchers, GM, Boca) that tell their own story: Use K-Y, get pregnant, buy car seat to put in GM minivan, drive to Weight Watchers meeting, go home and eat Boca Burger.  Lather. Rinse. Repeat.  \n\nI was relieved to spend time with a couple of the blog-related companies, who don't much care about my gender: Six Apart, whose Typepad product powers this blog, and Picnick, an extremely cool site that I used to add the text to my banner.  \n\n[Pointless tangent: I am home sick today watching Days of Our Lives; not because I am a fan of soaps, but because they are supposed to have a storyline involving a child with autism.  No luck so far, but there seems to be a plot line involving a bearded guy named Steve who wears an eye patch and seems to have been abducted and forced to have sex with some random woman not his wife.  Aliens, perhaps?  Clearly I don't get out much.] \n\nAnyway.\n\nThis year, I couldn't shake the feeling that, as women writing on the Internet, our strongest asset is in danger of becoming our greatest liability. Women in this country control a couple of trillion dollars worth of household spending, yet the phenomenon of women bloggers--an increasingly powerful media force--is largely seen as a sort of fluffy pink suburb, and, as Shannon aka Squid put it, BlogHer its \"Lilith Fair of blogging.\"\n\nI'm here to tell you: there was no hair braiding, no singing of Kumbaya, no synchronizing our periods.  There were, however, many smart, heated discussions in the hallways, in the panels, over dinner, in cars, and, yes, in the bathrooms.  We talked about politics, media, celebrity, family, sexuality, publishing, ethics, gender and where it's all going.  \n\nI couldn't help but be struck by how the blogosphere as a whole--male or female--is struggling with the same three issues: how to monetize (oh how I hate that word); how to preserve what's valuable and unique online; and the increasingly worrisome emphasis on celebrity.  What it all comes down to, in my mind, is your RFB--your reason for blogging.  What do you want from it?  Is it self expression?  A business tool?  A means to community?  All three?  Something else?\n\nConsider Whymommy, whose mission is to speak openly and honestly about her experience with inflammatory breast cancer and build a sense of community with other women in the same situation; Melissa, whose Stirrup Queens and Sperm Palace Jesters is a safe haven for people dealing with infertility; and, of course, all my special needs mom-blogger friends, about whom I'll write more soon.\n\nAll offer a purity of purpose, a warmth and inclusiveness, that is honest, down-to-earth, often funny, and very specific in its intention: to connect with and be a resource, even a friend, to others.\n\nThen there's Heather Armstrong, the person and the phenomenon, who probably could never have imagined that she would become The Most Famous Woman Blogger In the Whole Wide World, and who now openly struggles with the impact of this particular brand of celebrity on her and her family.  At the closing keynote, she spoke candidly about her life behind the scenes and her efforts to stay connected to her audience while protecting her family and her privacy. \n\nArmstrong mentioned a blogger who had referred to her as \"a mythical hobbit,\" the point of which was, in my opinion, to reject the idealization that reference implied.  The ensuing weirdness has been amply documented by now, and several have criticized Armstrong's response as arrogant, but I saw it as a warning: don't idealize me.  Don't let the cult of celebrity screw up what is meaningful about what we're doing.\n\nI think it's advice worth listening to, whether you write about scrapbooking, cancer, food, gender or politics.  Celebrity is a trap, and it corrupts what's most valuable about the blogosphere: the ability to connect directly with an audience on a topic that is mutually meaningful.  And I wonder if Armstrong doesn't believe that in a way she is a victim of her own success--that the ability to connect with so many people has been impossible to sustain as her audience and fame have grown.  I thought she seemed angry, wary and quite sad, actually.\n\nArmstrong isn't one of my regular reads, but I admire her fierceness and bravery in chronicling a deep depression and some very tough times, and she is funny as hell.  But she's also turned out to be a pretty polarizing force.  So she makes money.  So she's beautiful.  So she gets so many comments she has to close them down.  Calling her an \"imaginary hobbit\" is demeaning, because it buys into the whole celebrity mystique. It's ironic, sure, but it's also yucky. \n\nI believe that in the end Armstrong was trying to caution us: don't fall for the celebrity trap.  Don't idealize bloggers.  We're all real people with real lives.  Don't buy into the hype, don't seek it out, don't exploit it.\n\nLast year, Elizabeth Edwards inspired us.  This year, Heather Armstrong cautioned us.  But did we hear her?\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogher.com/blogher_conference/conf/2/general/1", "http://horngroup.blogs.com/horn_group_weblog/2008/07/give-up-the-b-1.html", "http://www.sixapart.com/", "http://www.picnik.com/", "http://www.buddytv.com/articles/days-of-our-lives/days-of-our-lives-tackles-auti-20559.aspx", "http://www.squidalicious.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbaya", "http://toddlerplanet.wordpress.com/", "http://stirrup-queens.blogspot.com/", "http://www.dooce.com/", "http://thebloggess.com/?p=598", "http://gwendomama.blogspot.com/2008/07/live-blogging-closing-keynote-blogher.html"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/07/blogher08-redux.html", "title": "BlogHer08 Redux: of mythical hobbits, minivans and the cult of celebrity"},

{"date": "November 01, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tSlowly, slowly, we are moving out of crisis mode and into something different: not stasis, exactly, but something more like accommodation.  Isaac goes to school willingly, insisting every morning that it won't be loud.  We talk about what might happen, and I can feel him shrink from the possibility of unexpected noise, rejecting even the possibility that school might be too much input for him today.\n\nAnd he processes the possibilities of the day in his own recursive way, like a tide coming in bit by bit, withdrawing and then inching a little further into the shoreline.\n\nThere still isn't enough support, but they're trying.  It's a slow dance, tidal also in its own way.\n\nWe sat in bed tonight as Isaac read his first real book independently.  He's read the words of Hop on Pop, but now he's reading Mo Willems' My Friend is Sad and we can see him enjoying not only the accomplishment of reading, but also the meaning in the book.  It's funny: there was a school fundraiser, and each child was encouraged to choose three books from a catalog: Isaac's choices: a Spongebob book, something else and this.\n\nIt's perfecty calibrated to his reading and comprehension level now: not too many words on the page, doable without being too easy, with a little humor and nuance to keep him engaged in the challenge of making meaning from it.  He's not all the way there: I can see him shoot by the pictures to find the next word, but he gets some of it: that the elephant is sad, that his friend is trying to make him happy.  It's a great start, and we're happy that he can decode what's on the page, but far more excited that there's clearly comprehension there, and pride.  \n\nAnd J's joy in seeing his son warm to reading is beautiful to behold.\n\nIsaac's picking up a lot of language at school these days: some random, and some quite comically appropriate.  \"Mommy, stop arguing,\" he told me this morning as I fought him to get his shoes and socks on.  And, the other day, as I tried to--as the DIR people say--\"playfully obstruct\" him out of a mood, \"Oh, just stop.\"  \n\nAnd guess what? I have a shiner. \n\nYep, a real, old-fashioned shiner.  I expect it'll be quite spectacular in the morning. Got home tonight, boot somehow slid on kitchen floor and I went face-first (cheekbone first, actually) into the door frame.  No amount of makeup is going to cover it.  I can already imagine the looks I'm going to get for the next several days.\n\nWe scrapped Halloween plans (Isaac's not that into it anyway), and hunkered down tonight.  I napped while the boys ran out for dal and tandoori.\n\nTomorrow, open studios, a trip to the bookstore and date night.

{"date": "November 15, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tIn Ralph Savarese's wonderful book Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption, he discusses the incredible changes in his son DJ once he learned to read.  Literacy gave DJ, who does not speak, a way to express himself, and his voice turned out to be quite extraordinary. It's a rare view into the way a non-speaking person with autism thinks. \n\nDJ uses words fluidly, metaphorically. Sometimes his prose is clear and declarative, sometimes it's reminiscent of Romantic or Surrealist poetry. His father, who is a professor of English, understood this innately, and encouraged DJ to tap into his desire to connect.  \n\nHere's an early note from DJ to his dad:\n\nNote to Dad\n\nyes.dearest sad dad you heard fresh self and freshly responded deserting your fears and just freed sad dear saved me. yes. yes. yes. yes.\n\n--DJ Savarese\n\nNote the phrase \"dearest sad dad.\" Who says people with autism don't have empathy?  Notice how DJ so deeply understands his father's fear and sadness, and the persistence and care it took to find an open channel through which to communicate. Note the music of the phrase \"just freed sad dear saved me\"; the internal rhyme of \"freed\" and \"dear.\" Say it aloud.\n\nAnd the final declaration: yes. yes. yes. yes.\n\nCan we learn more about poetry by studying autism?  About autism by studying poetry?\n\n***\nThe photo above is Isaac's first real independently-written note to us. If you've been following our saga, you may remember that we've been using social stories to help Isaac cope with his fear of unexpected noise, which has become focused (for reasons that are easy to understand) on fire drills.  \n\nIf you can't quite make it out, the note says:\n\n \"Isaac is upset. I don't like fire drills. They are too loud.\"  \n\nHe wrote it last week after a fire drill at school. While the prose doesn't rise to the sophistication of DJ's (he's only five, after all), it makes me wonder what will happen as Isaac becomes more confident about capturing his thoughts and feelings on paper.\n\nIt's been a gift for me.

What is he remembering? \u00a0What is he working out?My friend Christa knows a thing or two about hyperlexia, which is basically a precocious ability to read, often without the comprehension that's supposed to come with. I don't think that's what's going on with Isaac, but his ability to decode far outstrips his understanding of what he's reading. \u00a0And yet.\"Isaac, how do you think Gerald is feeling right now?\" I asked as he read his first Gerald and Piggy book, My Friend Is Sad.\"He's looking at the ground because he is upset,\" he answered. \u00a0\"Because he wants to be with his friend.\"Yes, I think he's got it. \u00a0*As the sentences elongate, become more complex, so do the bursts of temper and anguish. He's a gentle boy, but with his growing understanding I see a range of emotion that is sometimes more than he can bear. \"Don't laugh!\" he yelled earlier, seemingly at no one. Was someone's laughter too loud? Did someone hurt his feelings at school? \u00a0I have no idea, and the question--about whether his feelings were hurt--brings the expected wave of guilt, along with\u00a0a tiny swell of hope.Were his feelings hurt? \u00a0Developmentally, that would be, well, wonderful. It would signal a growing awareness of the rules of the social world and his place in it. It would mean a new level of emotional maturity. And yet the idea that Isaac's emotional radar is developing to that point breaks my heart; I can't bear the thought of my boy in pain, especially that kind of pain.*Not long after my mother died, I found myself coming home from every social occasion in knots. God, why did I say that? I'd wonder. And I'd obsessively try to remember everything I'd said that night in case something was just too colossally stupid. More often than not, I'd remember something that would torment me for days, sending a hot wave of blood to my face each time I remembered it.I'd always been somewhat shy, but this was different. It was obsessive, suffocating and all-consuming. What I didn't realize at the time was that it was also grief; a way for some of my pain about my mother to escape--through any crack it could find. \u00a0Over time it passed, and while I'm as capable of anyone of saying colossally stupid things, I no longer rake myself over the coals for it.I mention this because I wonder if Isaac also feels that kind of physical social anxiety--not quite in the way I did, but in some similar way. \u00a0And I just hope that if he does, we can help him find a way to work it out so that he approaches his emerging social experiences with openness and joy.My greatest hope: that the world cooperates.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://hyperlexicon.blogspot.com/", "http://www.hyperlexia.org/", "http://mowillems.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Friend-Sad-Elephant-Piggie-Book/dp/1423102975"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/11/just-tell-me-to-shut-up-anytime-1.html", "title": "Just tell me to shut up anytime"},

About why people die, and where they go after death. About God and science and how people's brains sometimes work differently. Why that's a gift, and why it's sometimes impossibly hard. And how it can be that people feel the need to hurt themselves and others to make a point.\n\nIt's the great paradox of parenthood, isn't it: wanting to have the hard conversations, because the hard conversations bring new understanding and intimacy and maturity. Because they are part of the deal when you become a parent. Hard as it is, I want that for my son.  I want that for us.\n\nAnd so tonight I have this impulse to ask the 8-Ball--with the same sweaty, childish faith I had so many years ago--will it happen?  Will we have those talks?

I stayed in a B&B, wandered the museums and parks of London and rented a car for a drive through the Cotswolds. \u00a0Driving on the left side of the road was an adjustment, but what was even more perplexing were the street signs. I was maybe a half-mile from the car rental place when I saw a sign with the charming if rather oblique message \"Priorities Change Ahead.\" I wonder what that could mean, I thought. I was so caught up in my reverie that I nearly collided with a truck on my left whose driver clearly believed he had the right of way. Which he did. Because in England, \"Priorities Change Ahead\" means YIELD.I've been thinking about priorities a lot lately. Isaac is in his fourth month of Kindergarten, and while he's doing better--less perseverating, less anxiety--he doesn't have enough support to keep him engaged. He's not the kid who will disrupt class; he'll just go into his private zone.\u00a0This worries me because while he's bright and tries hard, he needs almost constant support. It can be light pressure on his shoulder, a reminder to attend, or full hand-over-hand help. Without it he founders; with it he can flourish. \u00a0His school is trying to accommodate his needs, and we are working with them. The head of the inclusion program is everything you'd ever hope for: she's warm, passionate and genuinely committed to Isaac's welfare. She's creative about finding solutions for his challenges in school.\u00a0What she doesn't have: enough resources to meet the needs of the kids she works with. And honestly, creativity helps, but it only goes so far. The sad part? I realize how lucky we are, but it's still not enough.*Yesterday we got a babysitter and went to a housewarming for some friends of ours. S. held Isaac on his first day home from the hospital; at that time she was dating her now-husband. Their toddler wobbled cheerfully across the floor as people ate, drank and caught up. Periodically there were screeches and wails: nursing children, Lincoln Logs knocked over, cookies removed from sticky fingers, naps postponed too long. It was lovely, chaotic and warm.\u00a0I thought how nice it would have been to bring Isaac along. No one would have batted an eye, but it would have been too hard for him: the noise, the crowd, the jostling. And we would be distracted; worried about his anxiety level; unable to catch up with friends. Instead, he spent the afternoon happily climbing the monkey-bars at the playground. Was it the right choice?We'll be talking about this topic with him more and more in the coming months. In fact, our latest Gerald and Piggy book is called I'm Invited to a Party, which Isaac persists in calling \"I'm Invaded to a Party\" (under the circumstances, probably a more apt title).I wonder if we'll ever stop wondering whether to bring him along to parties or not; if it's healthy and right for him, or it's not fair: too loud, too busy, too, fast, too much.It's a lot to juggle and impossible to know what's right: when to rush into the unknown, and when, finally, just to yield.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mowillemsdoodles.blogspot.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Invited-Party-Elephant-Piggie-Book/dp/1423106873/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1227577041&sr=8-1"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/11/priorities-change-ahead.html", "title": "Priorities change ahead"},
{"date": "September 21, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tBack when Isaac was about two and we were investigating additional interventions for him, I spoke to the representative of a local autism services organization.  She stressed to me how important it was that I get Isaac into this particular type of program because, she explained, a child's neural plasticity is greatest before the age of three.  So it was, in effect, a race against time, and every second wasted was a second in which Isaac's future would be forever limited.  So we might want to sign up right this minute.\n\nI hated that conversation: the implication that we weren't doing enough already (speech and OT), that this was the right program for a child she hadn't even seen.  But most upsetting was this idea that at a particular point not long in the future, everything would be \"cooked\" and we had only a small window left to affect the course of our son's life.  Tick, tick, tick.\n\nOf course it was horseshit. \n\n*\nKindergarten has been a hard adjustment.  Aside from the question of support (not nearly enough, and about which I hope to have an update soon), the sensory environment is completely overwhelming for Isaac.  Twenty kids in the class, about 400 at the school, a huge playground, intercom announcements, assemblies, a loud, echoey cafeteria, and, worst of all, recess.  In a word, school.  Very much like my old elementary achool, when it comes right down to it, but a completely different experience for him.\n\nHe comes home exhausted, hyper, crabby.  He has far more frequent tantrums, and they're longer and more intense. The pattern, for the past few weeks, has been like this: by Friday he's not doing much work at all, Saturday is a nightmare, and by Sunday morning he's happy again and goofing around the house. He cries Monday mornings, Tuesdays through Thursdays are a little better, and then by Friday he's completely spent. Do we have twelve years of this to look forward to?\n\nYesterday was rough. He had a couple of really long tantrums, one of which was prompted by the fact that I refused to let him watch Thomas the Tank Engine in the room in which his father happened to be sleeping.  I said he could watch it in the front instead. \"I want to watch Thomas in the baaaaack!\" he yelled, and that was pretty much it for the next 45 minutes.\n\nI tried to explain how Daddy felt: that he was sleepy, that he needed to rest.  But I couldn't get through, and couldn't figure out whether it was because he didn't conceive of the idea that his father has feelings, or that he knew and understood, but didn't care. \n\nWhich is worse?\n\nMaybe there's a third option: that he knew, but was too upset and emotionally drained to behave accordingly.  That's a variant of the latter, I guess, and I think it's right.  Once he started to calm down, I asked him why I had told him he couldn't watch TV in the bedroom. \"Because Daddy wanted to sleep.\"  He knew.\n\nAnd so when J. and I are on the sofa at night watching movies but really thinking about him, we nearly always conclude with the reassurance that, after all, he's only five. It's our fine print. It's our \"out clause.\"  \n\nHe's just a little kid, we remind ourselves. This is just a phase. He keeps growing and changing all the time.\n\nBut one day soon he won't be little anymore. He's already bigger, stronger. More is expected of him: he has homework, for heaven's sake.  So will we get to a point where that out clause is just an artifact of an earlier, more innocent time?  Do we have to prepare to give it up one day?  Or is that a betrayal of his potential?\n\nWhat is the right balance between faith and acceptance?\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/09/the-out-clause.html", "title": "The Out Clause"},

So we thought we'd drive down Highway 1, stop at a farm stand on the way back, make a day of it.  What could happen?\n\nWhen we got there, I quickly noted the presence of two bounce houses, those evil, billowing abodes of doom, and immediately flashed back to a birthday party three years ago when Isaac, still preverbal and terrified, wailed loudly until it was well out of sight and earshot.\n\nThis time, he sauntered by and casually announced that he wanted to go in.  Ha, I thought.  Never happen.  The photo is irrefutable proof that i was wrong, wrong, wrong.  He did, in fact, go into the bounce house and bounce his little heart out.  Not once, not twice, but three times, in three different bounce houses.  They were loud, crowded and chaotic, but he didn't care.

Yesterday Isaac demanded pancakes yet again; it never ceases to amaze me how the simplest interactions can be full of opportunities to engage.  \n\nI ask him to get the New York Times Cookbook--my mother's, so it holds many memories--and he lugs it from the book shelf into the kitchen and plops it on the counter unaided.  I ask him what page the pancake recipe is on. \"Six-fifty-four\" he instantly replies.  \n\nBut then again, this is the boy who refers to places by address and Sesame Street shows by episode number.  \"I want to watch 3287,\" he'll inform me, and I have to question him in detail before realizing that it's the one where poor, unimaginative Prairie Dawn finally learns to become more \"monstery.\" \n\n[It's notable also for an uncharacteristically goofy performance by Maria, who usually maintains a more dignified persona.  And it fills me with a strange delight to know that I live in a world where I can type \"Wubba Wubba Wubba Wubba Woo Woo Woo\" into Google and, in a fraction of a second, find the exact episode I'm looking for.]\n\nBut I digress.\n\nWe assemble the dry and wet ingredients. Isaac reads the amounts off the recipe, but the fractions confuse him so I skip them and he carefully pours the contents into the bowl. After a while, he loses interest and wanders into the study.  It's okay: I finish up and bring him the fruit of his minimal labor.  He wolfs them happily, demanding more milk.\n\n*\nYesterday we went to see new friends--those same friends with the son who Isaac seems to like so well, but he ignored the boy for the better part of the afternoon, preferring instead to explore and stim and, at the playground, repeatedly check out the bathrooms and try to scrounge cake from other people's birthday parties. J. and I were tense, and at one point our friend G. lightly touched me on the shoulder and told me to relax. So reassuring to be with people who understand.\n\nIt wasn't until we went to a frozen yogurt shop that Isaac finally began to unwind a bit.  The four adults sat at a table eating yogurt and chatting while the boys gravitated to the ATM. After a while, they struck up a game (you heard me: they struck up a game) and began chasing each other through the place. Isaac would run through the shop, fall to the ground dramatically, and wait for his friend to catch up with him, flapping his arms a little from excitement, his eyes locked on the other boy's face.   Best of all, we had nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with it.\n\nI considered asking them to stop--it was a restaurant after all--but it was pretty much empty except for the six of us, and the teenaged employees didn't seem to care or, for that matter, notice.  When we said goodbye, Isaac hugged his friend. \n\nI'm tapping this out on my laptop now as J. putters around the house.  We're listening to the commentary from Ernst Lubitsch's Trouble in Paradise, which is a classic, deft and charming piece of film-making, graced by the elegant performance of Kay Francis, whose difficulty with her \"Rs\" gave rise to her nickname around Paramount as The Wavishing Kay Fwancis.

Seeing other people's creativity is refreshing, like a cup of tea or a hot shower.  And it calms my mind.\n\nOne day last year I was wandering around a local gallery when I spotted a painting by Kirsten Tradowsky. Kirsten paints representationally--she's not a showy painter, but her work has soul and a gorgeous, rich, yet muted palette.  I inquired about the painting, but it was out of my price range, and, as you can imagine, paintings have not been not at the top of my list of economic priorities.    \n\nOver the next few days, I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I emailed Kirsten to let her know how much I appreciated her work and to ask if she'd add me to her mailing list.  I received a lovely note back, and, a few months later, an email inviting me to an open house. J., Isaac and I went, and I bought a piece from her and wrote about it here.  My sister saw my blog post, and sweetly commissioned a watercolor for my birthday.  \n\nAnd then it hit me. Kirsten was the perfect person to paint a banner for The Family Room.  I asked her if she would do it, and she agreed. My favorite part of the banner is the image of Isaac at the beach that Beata took more than two years ago.

And that it's time to think about the future.\n\n\"Ah-ah-ah-ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive,\" Isaac sang out from the back seat as we drove down Highway One to Monterey.  And, later, \"I don't want Mommy to go back to work.\"  \n\nYet another bitter-with-the-sweet.  The bitter is obvious.  But the sweet? He's thinking about the future too.\n\nIn a couple of weeks, Isaac will begin kindergarten.  While preschool felt like an enormous step (my little guy, fending for himself), this is the real deal.  He'll be included in a classroom for typically-developing kids, but what inclusion will really mean is still mighty uncertain.  Will they get his sense of humor? His intelligence?  His sweet nature?  Will they be kind?\n\nAt our panel at BlogHer last month, we discussed the occasional tension between adults with autism and parents with kids on the spectrum--how in an effort to tell our stories, we frame and expose our children's.  It's a fair point. And yet in writing this, I have always hoped that my words will act as a sort of context for my child and others, because context is key to perception.\n\nImagine this: two children are in the schoolyard. One comes close to the other, playfully. The other child pushes him away.  Aggression, or self-defense against sensory overload?  I'm not saying it's okay for children to push, but there's a context for it.  And context can make all the difference.\n\nOr this: two children are playing ball.  A third comes up and tries to take the ball away.  Aggression, or an attempt to join the play?\n\nOr this: a teacher asks a child a question.  The child doesn't answer.  Willfulness, or a delay in auditory processing?\n\nIn these situations, the child is behaving perfectly rationally.  But his reality is not the status quo.  \n\nAs a parent, my constant struggle is to know how much to advocate--how much to explain the world to Isaac, and him to the world?  How much is enough to foster his independence without stunting his growth?

He waited patiently outside with me as they prepared our table, and when we entered I saw a brief look of skepticism on the faces of the family sitting next to us.  \n\nNo matter.  Isaac was a perfect gentleman. I ordered a poached tuna salad and tomato soup for me, and a cheese pizza for him.  He ate each piece carefully, discarding it a few bites through before picking up the next one.  I wrote out a sentence in blue crayon on the paper the waitress provided: \"I am so proud of you.\"\n\nHere we are at the end of the summer, and he's really surprised us.  He survived a haircut, two visits to the dentist (even allowing them to examine, clean, polish and floss his teeth), Kindergarten orientation, and a week-long vacation away from everything familiar.

{"date": "August 30, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tWe went to Sonoma today to get out of the fog, eat really good deli sandwiches and visit Train Town, which I've been betting would be big fun for Isaac.  Like a lot of the earliest California towns, Sonoma has a real square, complete with band shell, military barracks, cheese stores, sweet little shops and plentiful fudge.  In a word, heaven for us city-weary types.\n\nWe arrived at lunch time and grabbed sandwiches to eat in the square, which sports a nice little swing set and some sandy but serviceable picnic tables.  We wolfed our meal and spent a lovely half hour pushing Isaac on the swing.  He counted in Portuguese, Spanish and Swahili before reverting to English.  \"Forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine, forty-nine...actually, fifty.\"\n\nAfterwards, we headed to Train Town.  Like his beloved steam trains, it's a tiny little narrow-gauge railway that runs through a gorgeous wooded area.  And to our amazement and delight, Isaac insisted on taking his very first amusement park rides: a plane (pictured), the \"Scrambler,\" which, judging from his passionate insistence that he ride it OVER AND OVER, is like crack for the vestibular system, and the piece-de-resistance, the dragon roller coaster.\n\nOf course the day was also punctuated by numerous bathroom visits (to look, mostly) a bit of elevator obsession and a late-afternoon meltdown, but Isaac finally nodded off on the drive back, giving J. and me a chance to catch up on this turbulent week.\n\n*\nWhen Isaac was first diagnosed, I thought that the hardest thing about having a child on the spectrum would be having a child on the spectrum.  But I quickly discovered that I was focused on entirely the wrong thing.  Having Isaac has been my greatest gift, and if you've read beyond this post, I don't think I need to explain why. And so here's my five-cent revelation, guys: the hardest thing about having a child on the spectrum is the relentless advocating--every damn minute of every damn day--to make sure that the rest of the world treats him with the respect and care he deserves, until such time as he can do it for himself.\n\nAnd, with that, it's time to talk about the first week of school.  \n\nIn many ways it was good, but (here's the Bill Clinton part) it depends on what you mean by \"good.\"  If what you mean is: did Isaac do well, did he adjust relatively smoothly, did he handle the separation without torrents of tears, did he learn something new, are the teachers warm and caring, is the facility bright and well maintained, does everyone in the school have the best of intentions?  Well, sure.  \n\nBut if by \"good\" you mean: are the teachers and after-school staff provided enough training in how to work with children with autism? Is there enough support provided for the inclusion kids?  No. There wasn't much sleeping done here this week.\n\nIt's not a teacher issue: it's systemic. And it means that a lot of kids fall through the cracks because advocating for them is a full-time job.   \n\nAll of you with older children know this.  You know this and you fight every day for what your kids need. It's exhausting. And teachers are forced to pay Paul (and hope Peter doesn't notice) each and every day. As are--let's face it--administrators, who must navigate the medieval bureaucracies and politics of the state educational system, which is being slowly suffocated under the selfish, festering legacy of California's notorious Proposition 13.\n\nAnd so the irony is that Isaac actually had a pretty good week.  He likes his teacher, she seems to like him, and aside from recess, he seems to be adjusting to school just fine.\n\nAnd yet.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.traintown.com/", "http://www.redwoodvalleyrailway.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_13"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/08/we-went-to-sono.html", "title": "In which I simultaneously get on my soapbox and go all Clintonian on you"},

Later, they picked me up at work and we went to grab a pizza and sit outside in the uncharacteristically balmy spring air, watching the fancy dogs, the hipsters and sometimes, most amusingly, their befuddled parents, grasping for something familiar among the crazy quilt that is my city.  Isaac easily read \"Pizzeria Delfina San Francisco\" off the box, and spilled enough tomato sauce on himself that he looked like he'd gotten the worst in a barroom brawl.  \n\nAfterwards, we drove home and Isaac and I walked ahead as J. closed the garage.  Lately, he likes to run ahead a bit and then dash back into my arms, tickling me and smiling in that impish way he has.  We held hands, looked both ways and crossed the street together.  Suddenly, a car came over the hill, slowed when it saw us, and then sped up, sure it could make it across before we did.  \"Hey!\" I yelled, pulling Isaac back, and then, under my breath, \"You moron.\"  \n\nAnd I heard a little voice pipe up next to me: \"Those cars are STUPID!\"  \"Yep, pal, they sure are,\" I replied, and we walked the half-block toward home.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nickjr.com/shows/diego/index.jhtml", "http://www.exploratorium.edu/", "http://www.pizzeriadelfina.com/"], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/06/its-our-thirtee.html", "title": "Local color"},

And, most importantly, did they eat dinner naked?  I never got a satisfactory answer.)  \n\nWe didn't really go to baseball games, unless you count a softball game at a local park when I was about 11.

All was fine--quiet even--until Marvin Gaye landed in a helicopter in right field, royally pissing off Berry Gordy, who had a sort of running practical joke battle with him.

The truth is, he's there all the time.  He is the author and architect of the concept of \"QAP.\"  He plays with Isaac with an abandon and delight that makes me want to be a child all over again. In fact, one day a woman approached him near a bus stop in San Francisco. She was a retired occupational therapist, and told him, in a tone of awe, that she'd never seen a father play with a child like that in her experience.  Ever.\n\nNow I have to say that I have seen some damn fine play in my time. But there is a challenge, as we all know, to finding the right kind of play for a child on the spectrum.

We swam, we read in the sun, and I bought him a massage.  We went to a terrific dinner, and this morning swam again.

His baby daughter was asleep on the shoulder of the older man sitting next to him--his father?  His wife took photos.  A lovely tableau and a perfect day.  \n\nWhen we got home, Isaac grinned coyly at us and informed us that he wanted more cake.

{"date": "June 05, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tFor some reason, I don't know why, I'm actually a fairly superstitious person.  Whenever I'm in a plane, I touch my wedding ring at takeoff. I don't like to say things are going well, even when they are. I guess it must be hereditary: my grandmother used to warn me to stay out of range of Aunt Grace, who'd spit three times whenever something particularly good or bad happened. And at big events--weddings, funerals, graduations--I tend to scrutinize the details for omens: a dying flower, a stained skirt, a broken dish. I don't want to. I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time. I just do.\n\nAll of which is to say that yesterday, Isaac's preschool graduation, was a nest of signs. Would he sail into the room (signaling success and happiness in the years ahead)?  Would he refuse to enter (signaling a future of pain and isolation)?  Would he tell us he wants to go home (even worse)?\n\nHe's just a kid, I told myself as we walked the three blocks to school. Let him be.  Let him do what he does. It'll be fine.  \n\nIsaac held my hand as we crossed the street, then ran ahead, laughing, as soon as we stepped onto the sidewalk. When we entered the school building, he shied like a nervous colt. He knew a \"celebration\" was coming. And he was not at all sure that this \"celebration\" was a good idea. \nWe spent a few moments in the playroom with the other kids, who were a generally a blur of hair and socks and faces and the occasional shirt and tie.  Isaac contented himself by swinging from a chair suspended at the end of the room, while a classmate pushed him. \n\nFinally, it was time to go in. He balked. \"I don't want to go to the classroom,\" he told us.  \"I'm worried about the noise.\"\n\nWhat can you say to that? I held my camera gingerly as the children and parents trooped off.  Finally we were alone--J, Isaac, me...and my camera, which was starting to feel leaden in my hands.  I took a few photos of the room to keep myself occupied. The minutes ticked by, and finally J. let out a deep sigh that pierced my heart.  \n\nIt's not prophecy, I thought. It's not. It's just what's happening now. But I could feel that we were in that moment, the one where we stand on the outside of every rite of passage for the rest of our lives, looking on.\n\nFrom time to time, people came in to visit us.  Periodically, we asked Isaac if he wanted to go in.\n\n\"No,\" he said.  \"I want to stay here.\"\n\nFinally, abruptly, Isaac stood up and walked over to the entrance to the classroom.  He sat down in J's lap in the hallway and watched as the children sang and talked about how, at times of change, it's okay to feel happy and sad at the same time. And then the teachers produced white paper bags filled with pictures and stories from the year, each with a child's name, and began to hand them out. \n\nIsaac peered inside as the children retrieved their bags.  When the teacher called his name, he stood up, strode right into the classroom among the other kids, and took his bag. He spent the rest of the celebration in the classroom, in the throng of children and famiies. He ate a snack, hugged and kissed his teachers, and took pictures with his friends. We stayed until the end. Finally, I walked him to the yard and left for work while J. stayed to help clean up.\n\nAs I walked back to the car, it struck me: this is so completely characteristic of my son. He waited until the tail end of normal range to walk. We wondered if he'd ever speak. I didn't know if he'd ever say my name, or what he was feeling, or what he did that day. But, at what feels like the very last second, he decides he's ready, and he does it. Whatever it is.\n\nAs tough as it was, I think yesterday does have something to tell us about the future.  It was an omen. A pretty good one.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/06/for-some-reason.html", "title": "Moving on"},
{"date": "June 17, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tI remember the first days of summer camp: my sister and I wore white tee-shirts and sailor-style forest-green shorts with red name tags safety-pinned to them. We wore our hair in identical pigtails tied with yarn.  Every morning, rubbing our arms in the chill air, we boarded the bus for the seemingly endless trip to the wilds of Scarsdale.\n\nOnce there, we swam, made lanyards, and sang songs. I remember a particular song called \"500 Miles\" by Peter, Paul and Mary, which always made me feel deeply uneasy, as if by hearing it I would magically be transported 500 miles away from my own home.  It went like this:\n\n\n\nIn reality, camp was closer to 20 than 500 miles, but it still felt very far away, and very grown up.  I was anxious during a great deal of the day, knowing that my parents were a long bus ride away, but I eventually eased into the groove and started to enjoy myself.  \n\nSo it didn't surprise me too much to get this note from Isaac's teacher  today, the first day of camp (thankfully just a mere mile away):\n\n\"I think Isaac had a pretty good first day. He was able to identify his friends from school and meet new friends. We sat down for a woods meeting, hiked to the potty and the woods, had snack, wrote in our journals, played a group game and ate lunch together. Isaac did have some difficulty during woods meeting when [teacher] explained to the children how we keep safe from dogs and poison ivy. Isaac became anxious when she mentioned the dogs...\"\n\nYeah.  We've had a lot of that lately--anxiety about several things, noise in particular.  At first I was sort of alarmed--I don't want him to be this anxious--but it also reminded me of those mornings, waiting for the bus and thinking \"I don't want to go to camp today.  I'd rather stay home with Mommy.\"  But I eventually boarded the bus, and I sang with the best of them, and I made art projects and played foursquare and dodgeball and endured that horrible, suffocating feeling of first learning to swim.\n\nI was seven, maybe eight at the time.  And typically-developing.\n\nMaybe this whole thing affects me this way because with each passing milestone (and year), I see how hard Isaac works at the business of growing up.  And like many parents, I am both excited and terrified by his new abilities and the dangers they present.\n\nHe's proving to be a resilient boy, my Isaac. He's expressing his feelings more fluidly these days, and the result is that I--we--have to face them head on.  When I called home tonight before leaving work, I heard him say very clearly to J: \"I'm worried about the meadow\" (the meeting-place for camp). And so we're telling stories about noise and dogs and buses and all sorts of things, in the hope that each story, each slender thread, is enough to help him cope, to pull him through his day to a kind of peace, growing up--and happiness.\n\n* Postcard in photo courtesy of my nine-year-old self, written during my very first summer at sleepaway camp.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/06/high-camp.html", "title": "High camp"},

After about a minute, I added the olive oil, waited until it started to smoke just the tiniest bit, and plopped in the burgers.\n\nWithin seconds, the house was filled with the savory smell of garlic and turkey and warm olive oil.

I turned off the heat and ran into the bedroom, where Isaac was standing rooted to the spot, his hands over his ears.  \"It's okay, sweetie,\" I said, \"It's just the smoke alarm,\" as J. ran to open the back door.

Reading quietly together on a comfy chair. But one of my earliest dreams was about making breakfast together on a weekend morning. First, the coffee (mine), then the milk (his), then choosing what to make (pancakes), then measuring and pouring and mixing until we devoured the result in a happy, giddy mess.\n\nIn the early days after Isaac's diagnosis, I agonized over his painfully brief attention span; his tendency to flit from one thing to another until he found a door or a drawer that he could open and close endlessly. I read Stanley Greenspan's The Child With Special Needs and skipped to the \"Prognosis\" sections and tried to parse the statistics, but mostly I cried a lot.\n\nI got into the habit of making him French toast every Sunday morning, and sometimes I would half-heartedly ask him to come in and help me stir.  \"No stirring,\" he'd say, once he was able to use language.\n\nI gave up.  \n\nFor some reason, I decided to try again yesterday.  \"Isaac, what would you like for breakfast today?\"  His answer?  \"Cupcakes.\"  (That birthday cupcake last week made an impact).  \"Well,\" I said, \"You can't have cupcakes for breakfast, but we could make pancakes.\"  I let it hang there for a moment.  \"Do you want to make some pancakes with Mommy?\" \"Yes,\" he answered, looking up.  \"Let's go to the kitchen.\"\n\nI got his stepstool, a copy of the New York Times Cookbook (if you ever make a time capsule, put it on your list), and laid out all the ingredients.  He read \"cookbook\" off the front cover, and \"one cup mik\" from the recipe.  I measured, and he poured and stirred the dry ingredients together.  \n\n\"One egg,\" I said, as we got to the wet ingredients. \"I want two eggs,\" he argued, but I prevailed and we settled on one.  After we were done mixing the dry and wet ingredients together, I asked him to put the bowls and used spoons in the sink and throw away the butter wrapper.  Then I let him watch the stove from a few feet away as I poured the batter into a heated frying pan. \n\nThe pancakes were delicious.

BEEP!\n\nMe: Isaac, was there a fire drill at school?\nIsaac (whispers): Yes.\nMe: Was it very loud?\nIsaac (whispers): Yes.\nMe: How did that make you feel?\nIsaac: Upset. \nMe: You know, most people don't like fire drills.  But tomorrow at school it will be quiet.  There won't be a fire drill.  Do you know what to do if a fire drill happens?\nIsaac: Cover your ears.\nMe: That's right.  We cover our ears.  And that makes it quieter.\nIsaac: I was sad.\nMe: Why were you sad, sweetie?\nIsaac: I was sad because [T] (his teacher) picked me up.\nMe: Okay, so maybe tomorrow you can tell [T] how you feel.\n\nEventually, Isaac asked for a \"fire drill story.\"  For those of you interested in social stories, I can tell you that we've been able to adapt them lately so that they're a lot less work than they used to be (unless, unlike me, you are extremely crafty and a huge fan of lamination). So this is a pared-down version, which works if, like Isaac, your child has enough language and engagement to contribute to the story but still needs some help putting it together.  It went something like this (the bold is for Isaac's contributions):\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a little boy named Isaac.  Isaac lived in San Francisco. One day, he was very, very upset and started to cry.  \n\nHis mommy said, \"Isaac, why are you crying?\"  \"Because I am worried about going to school,\" Isaac answered.  \"There was a fire drill at school, and the fire drill is too loud.\"  \n\nHis mommy thought about this for a moment.  \"What do we do when there's a fire drill?\" she asked. And Isaac said, \"we cover our ears.\"  \n\n\"That's right,\" Mommy said.  \"We cover our ears. And if we're scared, we can ask our teacher for a big hug.\"  And so Isaac went to school, and there was no fire drill, and he was very happy.  The End.\n\nThe next day, I took him to school.  \"First go to school, then Daddy will pick me up, then we'll ride the elevator,\" he said.  (The elevator is still wildly popular around here.  Go figure.)\n\nWhen we got to school, he strode right in, went right up to T., the teacher who had picked him up and carried him into school, and gave him a hug. T. sat down at the tiny child's table, my son looking over his shoulder, and he began to dictate a new letter:\n\n\"Dear Mommy,\n\nI want Momma to come back to school.  Because I don't want the fire alarm.  I want you to read it and write it again.  And again.\"  \n\nThis little missive came home in his lunch box, along with another piece of paper that stated, simply, \"No fire alarm today!!!\"\n\nI'd say that sent a pretty clear message to the American people, wouldn't you?  \n\nSince then, he's been perfectly relaxed.  We tell a few stories, we write a few letters.  We go to school.  And he's fine. Just fine. \n\nThe End.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/05/in-our-last-epi.html", "title": "We don't need no education"},
{"date": "May 12, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tIf I were a 19th century lady of a certain age and class, I could simply retire to my chambers and let it be known that I am unwell and not accepting callers at the moment.  I would read, and nap, and take my meals in my room, and write letters until my equilibrium returned.  \n\nAs it happens, not so much.  But J. took Isaac for a walk this evening so I could do just that, sweet soul that he is.  Because it happened again.  I Don't Want To Go To School: The Return.\n\nHere's the (increasingly familiar) abridged version: get to front door of school, cry, fall to the ground, scream, resist, teacher carries him in, more screaming and kicking, hot, hysterical tears and wailing as I finally manage to leave.  But it worries me, this idea that the morning is a minefield I need to pick my way through, step by careful step, lest we end up covered in boogers and emotional shrapnel.\n\nSeparation anxiety, folks.  Pure and simple.  Though, as we've all learned here at the School of Developmental Difference, nothing is simple.\n\nThere is, however, a pretty fine silver lining to this story, which I will now share in the interest of, well, reason for optimism (and not sounding like a total whiner.)\n\nNot long after the dropoff (soon enough that I was still in tears, unable to answer the phone), I got a voicemail from one of Isaac's teachers saying that he was fine, and that she was amazed at the way he had processed his emotions after I left.  It turns out that she had sat down with him and asked him to tell her how he felt.  She wrote, he dictated, and she read him what she'd written.  Afterward, one of his classmates gave him a hug.\n\nThis later email from the head of his school sums it up:\n\nThis level of emotional processing is thoroughly exciting to see, hear, witness.  I listened as a fly on the wall to [teacher] and Isaac and was amazed to hear what he was saying, how articulate he was, how clearly he conveyed his emotions...He is taking his strong feelings, expressing them in a young way when you, his beloved mother is around, but then when the separation is actually over, he then reviews, reexperiences the feelings in a more mature way that will help him generalize how to handle other hard emotional situations.  As hard as it is for you, and I don't want to underestimate it, I hope you are also thrilled with the leaps he is making...\"\n\nThe teacher's voice mail emphasized how much Isaac had loved it when she wrote down his feelings.  He was excited and fully engaged in the process, and kept referring to it throughout the day.  \n\nImagine that.  Writing down your feelings.  To try to make sense of them.  Brilliant.\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://susanetlinger.typepad.com/the_family_room/2008/05/in-which-i-reti.html", "title": "In which I retire to my room with the vapors, my laptop and a dish of ice cream"},
