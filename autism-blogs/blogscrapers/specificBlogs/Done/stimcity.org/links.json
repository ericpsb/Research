{"date": "March 10, 2011", "body": "\u00a0The following letter was written on the battlefield in Afghanistan, July, 2010, after the district special ed director reduced the hours of paraprofessional support for RM at her YMCA summer camp\u2026 without prior notification, or grounds to do so\u2026\u00a0Dear [Special Education Director],My Name is [SGM]. I am the father of [RM] and a taxpayer in the Town of [StimCity].\u00a0 I am currently deployed to Afghanistan as the Operations Sergeant Major for [an Infantry unit].\u00a0 You may recognize the unit as [part of the battalion] is stationed in\u00a0[StimCity] on Main Street and is one of my companies.\u00a0 Currently, there are 499 soldiers deployed here from Connecticut of which I am responsible for their care and\u00a0well-being in an extremely hostile environment.The key to my success in the past 24 years, 3 wars, 7 countries and an untold amount of soldiers is COMMUNICATION. General Patton once said, \u201ckeeping the foot soldier informed is incalculable.\u201d\u00a0 This holds true in the civilian world and business world of which you, [Special Ed Director],\u00a0and your co-workers are currently employed.I find it hard to believe that anyone can actually get up in the morning and look themselves in the mirror and say, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to make someone angry today.\u201d\u00a0 So, I am thinking that all of what I am being told is a huge breakdown in communication.\u00a0 If this is the case, we are failing not only our children, but ourselves. These children are our future \u2013\u00a0no matter how disabled.\u00a0 These children will grow up and become the Department of Education, Police Officers, Firefighters, and Accountants of our retirement accounts. I am thinking again, that we should do our best to help them in any way possible.\u201cDepartment of Education\u201d\u2026\u00a0 This makes me think that \u201ceducated\u201d people work there.\u00a0 And being such an important department with what I can only imagine is a very large salary budget (above the 600K maybe?) I would assume that [StimCity] would hire qualified personnel.\u00a0 So, I am going to go out on a limb here and assume that all the people\u00a0included in\u00a0this email are educated and are qualified.So this leads me to my question\u2026 Why am I having to write this letter from\u00a0AFGHANISTAN\u00a0to find out why a Town Worker that I assist in paying the salary for can\u2019t seem to pull it together and communicate with families in a nice, civilized way?\u00a0 Why are grown adults having to resort to email and lawyers to discuss the programs that children in a town as large and prosperous as\u00a0[StimCity] are entitled to?COMMUNICATION.Somewhere along the line, we have a communication failure.\u00a0 In my line of work this is quickly identified as \u2018the dead pile up on the battlefield\u2019.\u00a0 In this instance, the \u2018dead\u2019 would be the children and parents that have come to a dead-end with a department established to HELP find them solutions to their issues.\u00a0 We are failing.Many people, who have little inside knowledge of how the military works except for what they see on television,\u00a0 do not understand the real way we communicate in the Army. I very seldom bark orders, yell,\u00a0nor do I ever belittle, degrade, chastise or berate soldiers in daily duties or on the battlefield. I give CLEAR orders and\u00a0GUIDANCE in a voice that establishes trust and understanding.\u00a0 I lead by example, and in return earn my soldiers\u2019 undying trust, devotion and RESPECT.\u00a0 They will follow me anywhere as long as I COMMUNICATE to them what we are doing and why.We call this \u2018Task and Purpose\u2019.With that, we accomplish amazing things.So, [Special Education Director and Staff], what is YOUR TASK AND PURPOSE?If you cannot answer this question without looking at your job description then you are wrong.\u00a0 If you did look at your job description, you will not find the words \u2018compassion\u2019, \u2018understanding\u2019, \u2018helpful\u2019 and \u2018committed to what is right\u2019 \u2013 Reason: they are expected of everyone regardless of what we do for a living.\u00a0To help in this process I will be more than happy to sit and communicate with each and every one of you.\u00a0 I will be home shortly for 2 weeks, and in a few months I will return for a longer stay.\u00a0 I will be available morning, noon, and night to discuss my daughter and her education, the Department of Education, and even some of my experiences in better communication.I welcome an open dialogue that will promote a FRIENDLY PROBLEM-SOLVING environment between parents and [StimCity Personnel].\u00a0 Because if we fail this cause \u2013 at some point \u2013\u00a0enough people like [us parents] will get together, pool resources and communicate together to form a plan that removes roadblocks to success.I look forward to working with all of you to come to an agreeable solution to what is really a very simple problem to fix.Respectfully,SGM", "outgoing_links": ["https://stimcity.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/sgm-stimcity-letter.jpg", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/military-life/"], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2011/03/10/battleagainstautism/", "title": "What the Battle Against Autism Sometimes Looks\u00a0Like\u2026"},

{"date": "March 6, 2011", "body": "(This was first posted in July of 2010)Last\u00a0Sunday morning, I got up feeling adventurous. (My husband has been in an Infantry unit in Afghanistan since January, and our daughter was just diagnosed PDD-NOS/Autism Spectrum Disorder in February, after being born during my husband\u2019s last deplyoment with a chromosome deletion and many medical issues, developmental delay, etc.)I thought today seems like as good a day as any to try to take her to church. We had brought her every Sunday from the time she was born, even through the toughest times of her congestive heart failure and feeding tube days, until one day about 18 months ago \u2013\u00a0she began screaming the moment we walked into the building. I tried for 20 minutes to calm her not understanding what the problem was, etc.,\u00a0thinking it was a mood rather than anything else and she would eventually be alright to sit for mass.It never happened.Scores of dirty looks, impatient parishioners waiting for me to just give up and walk out. And I did. The beauty of that moment was that it prompted one of the active members of the parish to begin a dialogue of inclusion for special needs. Great! \u2013 Except that the accomodations the church made to make mass more accessible for kids and adults like my daughter weren\u2019t going to help us if we still couldn\u2019t get through the front door with her. And after a few subsequent attempts it seemed that we were never getting her IN the building again no matter what changes were made inside to accomodate her needs. The church set up a small, quiet room to simulcast mass through TV for those that were sensory sensitive like my daughter. Yet, we have still not made it to that room. So that brings us to last Sunday when I felt energetic and enthusiastic enough to try again.Well, we made it through the parking lot to the door. THAT was an accomplishment. But when we got there and I motioned to go inside, my 4 year old just imploded. And it was heartbreaking. I could feel her discomfort at the very thought of just setting foot inside the door. Fifteen minutes of her screaming in tears outside the door, with me sitting calmly on the ground in front of the door patiently waiting. Dozens of people had come and entered the church. Most looked the other way as to save me from the embarrassment of their glare and some even felt compelled to comment. \u201cWell that\u2019s a toddler for you.\u201d Or worse, \u201cBeen there.\u201dNo. You haven\u2019t been there.I wasn\u2019t giving up. So after a few more minutes \u2013 after the screaming had stopped \u2013 I slowly stood up and made my way through the glass doors asking her to join me (and her brother who was already inside with my parents). Even as she protested, I slowly stepped inside the door. Now there we were \u2013\u00a0her on the outside, me on the inside. I sat down on the carpet inside the door and opened her backpack as she watched me through the glass. I slowly and carefully pulled her favorite toys from the backpack and laid them out for her to see. I signed to her to come in and play. She cried.As this was continuing, more parishioners would come and enter the door, give me a brief look of contempt as to why I was teasing my poor child on the outside of the glass \u2013 all alone \u2013 I didn\u2019t care, I kept trying. There was one young father with a 1-year-old baby boy who took the time to ask me if there was anything he could do to help. I explained to him that she is autistic and has sensory issues and therefore had much trouble with the idea of coming inside the doors. So he sweetly dangled his baby boy in front of the glass like a prize for my daughter if she would just come in. I truly appreciated this father\u2019s innocent attempt to help. He asked questions. He had compassion. It made the lengthy stalemate pass by just a little more swiftly.I never did get her inside the door. But what I did accomplish in almost 90 minutes of trying was just a little more comfort than we had before. She tolerated me on the other side of that glass door for more than an hour. A couple of times near the end of our time there she did approach the door and even open it a peek. And though small a victory it was, I did feel victorious. I felt victorious the moment we stepped out of my truck and she took my hand just to walk up to the building. Everything she accomplished beyond that was pure gravy. And she DID accomplish a lot. She made it TO THE DOOR. Maybe next time she will step inside, even for a second or two. And I will keep trying.That\u2019s why we do it. She will sit in mass once again someday. We will join together as a family in a ritual that is of importance to us and it will be worth every hour spent staring through those glass doors cheering her on to come a little closer. I have to. I don\u2019t know any other way than to just keep fighting the fight and keep pushing forward. It\u2019s worth every dirty look, worth every ignorant comment. And I will continue to speak up and say, \u201cMy daughter has autism, and we made it all the way to the door today!!! I am PROUD!!!\u201d Just as I said last Sunday to everyone who passed by us.We do what we do because we just love our kids.", "outgoing_links": ["https://stimcity.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/rmxmas1.jpg"], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2011/03/06/church/", "title": "The \u201cChurch Story\u201d\u2026"},

My children lost so much that day as well.\u00a0 They missed their father tucking them into bed each night and missed his laughter and his Turbo Hugs.\u00a0 Daddy missed his son\u2019s giggles and spent many lonely nights sleeping in a tent thousands of miles away while his baby girl slept in a hospital bed.\u00a0 We all missed each other so much it physically hurt.While my husband served in Afghanistan against the War on Terror, I spent months in the Situation Room carefully gathering data, assessing threat levels and calculating acceptable loss.\u00a0 I qualified available assets and carefully exploited what I needed to and when.\u00a0 No, I am not The Commander in Chief of The United States Armed Forces and my Situation Room may not be located on Pennsylvania Avenue \u2013 but I have had my own operations to conduct in my own Situation Room here in Stim City.With each mission Daddy went on, the Situation Room here was busy, too.\u00a0 Where SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) were carefully followed to the letter on such missions as traveling hazardous resupply routes to acquire necessary equipment and sustenance.\u00a0 Taking a toddler and his baby sister with tubes and pumps attached to the grocery store without incident.\u00a0 The coordination of the simplest of things such as attending a preschool concert were impossible and quickly eliminated and categorized as \u2018acceptable losses\u2019 in the bigger picture of operations.\u00a0 So were such things as pedicures and Girls\u2019 Night Out.Because of the evil that exists in this world, the work of our soldiers is never truly done.\u00a0 However, we celebrate a victory today \u2013 not of the death of a miserable monster \u2013 but of the renewal of our faith that America indeed stands for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u00a0 Our freedom is never free, but damn are we blessed that our soldiers do what they do.To ALL those who serve our country\u2019s military and to the partners, grandparents, family and friends back home who run and assist in The Situation Room \u2013 God Bless YOU.God Bless America.\u00a0[Ed note: May 1, 2012.

LOVED. IT.This kid went NUTS. GOOD nuts.

{"date": "November 8, 2014", "body": "These are REAL comments on Autism Daddy\u2019s facebook page concerning Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s recent disclosure that he might be on the autism spectrum:Melissa P: \u201cAs the mother of a very high functioning Aspie, I was very offended by Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s self diagnosis. I saw his stand up once and saw beneath the veneer of his comedy an arrogant, elitist prick. His \u201csocial awkwardness\u201d comes from his elitist viewpoint atop his magic money empire which prevents him from connecting with an \u201caverage\u201d person. It doesn\u2019t make him an Aspie, it makes him an a-hole.\u201dKaren D: \u201c\u2026gee what I wouldn\u2019t give to have my essentially non-verbal son have a hit tv show for over a decade, make millions, talk casually on Letterman and Leno, do stand up. It\u2019s like night and day, cookies and carrots, hard and easy\u2026yeah they have things in common but they are so far from each other it\u2019s hard to see their commonality. An when you\u2019re struggling it\u2019s hard to empathsize with a very successful, rich, funny star saying he\u2019s got troubles too.\u201dJessi F: \u201cI generally take issue with adults who self-diagnose \u2013 not saying adult dx doesn\u2019t happen, but go to a professional & then I\u2019ll believe you. Seeing anyone quirky/different as being on the spectrum annoys the everloving shit out of me (my kids are relatively high-functioning, but have OCD, anxiety, and major depression to go with. Fun times.)\u201dShannon N: \u201cI\u2019m really conflicted about this, because I think many people can see particular traits that are present in autism in themselves even if neurotypical. Maybe there\u2019s more to it than what he said in the interview. It just seems that lately anyone that finds themselves to be a bit quirky, or not extroverted, is identifying as autistic.\u201dJust out of curiosity, how many of the people who form an opinion like these above have spent any real amount of time with the folks they are judging? And exactly what data are they using to make these judgments? Also, when they are out in public with their child with autism who might be having a meltdown, or if they are themselves having a meltdown, do they whip out the psych eval that proves such to show passersby? WHO ARE YOU SO ANGRY WITH??? It is not, and never has been, a competition along the spectrum of autism. Yet that\u2019s a complete lie because it actually has always been a competition because no matter who you are as an individual with autism, you are labeled as either \u201chigh-functioning\u201d, \u201clow-functioning\u201d, \u201cself-diagnosed\u201d, \u201cnon-verbal\u201d, or some other twist of vocabulary to make sure you are put in your place. Why? God only knows. It serves NO PURPOSE whatsoever. In fact, not only does it create inappropriate limitations on some, but it creates inappropriate expectations on others. It creates crippling animosity between the \u201clevels of functioning\u201d on the spectrum, especially between parents and caregivers. And here, in the case of Mr. Seinfeld, it paints a contradictory portrait of what autism for a man \u201clike him\u201d should look like.\u00a0When convenient, parents and caregivers, and self-advocates will use this common description of autism: \u201cThere is no one autism.\u201d However,\u00a0they quickly rescind that philosophy when met with a\u00a0high-functioning celebrity with autism\u00a0\u2013\u00a0then the adage simply doesn\u2019t apply. Out yourself as gay? Sure. No one claims that without being brave as hell. You\u2019re going to face either abject persecution from family, friends and society, or if you\u2019re extremely blessed you\u2019ll only live with the daily discrimination our society as a whole still dishes out. Got cancer? No one\u00a0jokes about having cancer so you\u2019re likely telling the truth. No one starts a judgy facebook thread on whether or not you really have cancer and certainly no one gets into public\u00a0arguments about whether or not your one malignant mole is as scary as full-on liver cancer. It\u2019s CANCER. Everyone freaks out and offers to bring you a meal. BUT AUTISM OR ASPERGERS???? HOLD UP. Everyone suddenly decides to take to the streets and online minefields to debate that shit and ignore that you just opened your soul for the world to see.\u00a0Statements like: \u201cEveryone is on the spectrum somewhere, we\u2019re all a little quirky. No big deal.\u201d\u00a0Why should they treat you with compassion and empathy? Why acknowledge that you have come forward displaying what you believe or know for certain is a lifelong condition of your very being? Apparently because you chose this and the autism community simply disagrees. This is AUTISM. It was there from birth. Imagine the host of feelings for an adult to finally find the answers they have been searching a lifetime for! When I discovered my autism, first through self-diagnosis because HELLO, you have to start somewhere \u2013\u00a0I was relieved and thrilled to have answers!\u00a0 I\u2019m not 3 or 6 or 17 years old.\u00a0 I\u2019m an adult and I had to figure it out for myself.\u00a0 Then I had to decide if I wanted a formal diagnosis.\u00a0 But let\u2019s be honest here \u2013\u00a0Mr. Seinfeld is pretty damn smart.\u00a0 He knows a lot of smart people.\u00a0 Are we really going to hold him to a clinical diagnosis\u00a0to \u201cclaim\u201d him as one of our own?\u00a0 Do you question his ability\u00a0or motive at 60 years old to understand\u00a0the diagnosis he is seeking? \u00a0Do you really think this man went public on the evening news without some serious discussions? John Elder Robison is a dear man, respected member of the autism community and was \u201ccasually\u201d diagnosed by a physician friend as an adult. He didn\u2019t seek a formal diagnosis right away\u00a0\u2013 he didn\u2019t have to!\u00a0Only later did he do so in the\u00a0course of participating in clinical research. So why do we judge one and not another??? Is it because this is a career comedian who made a ton of money?\u00a0 Is this the disenfranchised autism \u201ccommunity\u201d displaying its jealousy of\u00a0\u201chigh-functioning\u201d? Of fame and fortune?\u00a0 Why are we not throwing\u00a0the entire\u00a0weight and love and support of the autism community towards Mr. Seinfeld\u2019s brave announcement AND TO EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO SEEKS COMMUNITY AS AN AUTISTIC? And we still wonder why this \u201ccommunity\u201d of autism cannot pull itself together and get anything done. It\u2019s so important that we set the example for ALL individuals who think they may be on the spectrum that WE WILL WELCOME THEM!!!! My sincerest blessings to Mr. Seinfeld for his bravery on this journey to self-discovery. My prayers to all individuals who struggle to be accepted and supported on their journeys, whether children or adults, whether diagnosed or in the process of discovering their autistic roots. You are amazing and you are loved. And there *is* a community waiting for you that will accept you and love you for everything you are. Never give up. ***Friendly reminder, Folks \u2013 Please allow time for your comment to appear unless it qualifies as hurtful, hateful, contains inappropriate language, etc.\u00a0This is a place of acceptance and safety.\u00a0While\u00a0I welcome opposing viewpoints, we all deserve respect.\u00a0Thank you.***", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2014/11/08/dear-autism-community-seinfeld/", "title": "Dear Autism \u201cCommunity\u201d: Do You HEAR\u00a0Yourselves?"},

{"date": "March 26, 2013", "body": "[Hello, Friends.\u00a0 This morning I sent the following email to just about everyone. Attached was the State Department of Education complaint we filed last week. I am not sharing the actual complaint document here as it contains personal details, but the general content of the complaint is described in the below letter.]Good morning, Governor, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u00a0My name is Rachel Kenyon, mother of RM (6).\u00a0 RM is a special education student in the town of Manchester and attends the *** School.Once again, our family has been subjected to unethical practices carried out by the Pupil Personnel Services (PPS) Staff of Manchester Public Schools.Attached you will find the complaint filed last week with the State Department of Education, Special Education Bureau.\u00a0 There were an additional 200 pages of documentation that we provided to support the complaint.\u00a0 Those documents are available upon request to all parties in this communication. This complaint was filed after a Planning and Placement Team (PPT) meeting on March 4th, 2013, during which the Outplacement Coordinator of Manchester Public Schools (MPS), refused to listen to and accept a recommendation by RM\u2019s neurologist and advised me instead to file for mediation or due process, or file a state complaint.I spend much of my time advocating for special needs families when I am not advocating for my own children.\u00a0 Sadly, time and again the families that seek out my assistance are also victims of the continued practice of MPS to say \u201cno\u201d to appropriate services for special education students, forcing parents into a corner.\u00a0 Special needs families are struggling day to day.\u00a0 We are the most vulnerable population within our communities while also the most underserved.\u00a0 Most of our families do not have the resources to spend thousands of dollars on attorneys\u2019 fees to push for the legal access to education their children are afforded under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Rather, our families are being bullied to the brink of exhaustion within a system that is so inherently flawed that the Pupil Personnel Services (PPS) staff think nothing of laughing at parents and telling them to go ahead and file for mediation or due process.Our family has endured several such PPT meetings where we were laughed at and ignored by PPS, and talked over by Board legal counsel.\u00a0 We have been to mediation.\u00a0 We have spent thousands on attorneys\u2019 fees while my husband was serving in Afghanistan.\u00a0 Years later now, I have educated myself regarding the rights and laws designed to protect my child\u2019s best interest, yet I have never experienced a single member of the PPS staff exhibit an ounce of compassion or reason when discussing my child\u2019s education. Instead, PPS staff have refused to even listen to physician recommendations and also refused the simple courtesy of including a school physician consultant in PPT invitation.\u00a0 Even more disturbing, is that the Outplacement Coordinator for MPS was once RM\u2019s in-district speech pathologist.\u00a0 There was a time when Ms. Outplacement Coordinator claimed to love my child and enjoyed eating lunch with her each day.\u00a0 Subsequently, it was Ms. Outplacement Coordinator who rejected RM\u2019s neurologist\u2019s diagnosis of autism in 2010 while my husband was in Afghanistan.\u00a0 MPS then conducted an in-district evaluation while our family hired an attorney and pursued an appropriate Independent Educational Evaluation, mediation, and eventually outplacement.My daughter may have disabilities, and she may need accommodations to access the educational curriculum, but she is worthy of the same high expectations that we place upon our \u201ctypical\u201d children.\u00a0 IDEA specifically states that right.\u00a0 Please tell me that you agree we should have high expectations of our educators and PPS staff as well. Please share with us that you agree and understand that the accommodations and high expectations we have of our special children today will prepare them for a successful and independent future rather than a lifetime of dependence on social programs and dollars, incarceration, mental illness, or worse.As a lifelong resident of Manchester, it is sad and so embarrassing to know that Manchester Public Schools has a deplorable reputation regarding special education.\u00a0 The special needs community sees no improvement on the horizon.\u00a0 How can we come together to change that?\u00a0 Because requiring my Congressman\u2019s office to attend and observe a PPT seems dangerously heading in the opposite direction of any hope that we can make our district great again.While I continue to learn more about MPS and district practices, I also invite all of you to get to know my daughter and our experiences with Manchester Public Schools.\u00a0 I invite you to witness the deep chasm between the best interests of our unique and amazing children and MPS practices.I wish to take this opportunity to thank MPS for pushing me so hard to fight for my daughter\u2019s educational rights.\u00a0 Not only has it allowed me to pay it forward and teach other parents how to advocate for their children, but it has given me a national platform to pass federal legislation and bring these battles to light.\u00a0 I have made multiple Freedom of Information Act requests to Manchester Public Schools. Please look for my upcoming articles with TIME, Huffington Post, Autism Speaks, American Military Families Autism Support, Babble.com, The Courant, The Journal Inquirer, Manchester Patch, and CTFEAT, as well as my own publication Welcome to StimCity.Thank you for your time. I look forward to working with all of you to bring awareness and equality to the special education of our most unique and amazing children. Most especially, I look forward to seeing Manchester Public Schools work to improve their service to the special needs population and lift up our families rather than add to our burdens. I look forward to one day sitting across the table from MPS staff and having a sound, meaningful relationship which includes respectful dialogue concerning the best interests of my daughter.Best,Rachel Kenyon", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2013/03/26/open-letter-boe-state-of-ct/", "title": "An Open Letter to Governor Malloy, Connecticut Congressional Delegates, Manchester Board of Education, Board of Directors, and Manchester Public Schools\u00a0Administration"},
{"date": "January 11, 2013", "body": "Friends, there has been\u00a0much discontent among the \u2018autism community\u2019 \u2013 which in my understanding is the correct term for *all* persons with an interest in autism to include parents, Autistics, professionals, educators, advocates, etc.I have remained quiet and abstained from such discussions.\u00a0 Not because I lack passionate opinion, but because my interest is in remaining a useful member of the community.\u00a0 Even in advocacy efforts, I have attempted the impossible of not affiliating\u00a0myself with one particular organization over another simply because of the intense conflict over the years, most of which occurred long before I came on the scene, and sadly seems to be progressing rather than waning.\u00a0 What is most upsetting is that these divisive chasms\u00a0make the possibility of unfettered autism unattainable.That\u2019s right \u2013 unfettered autism.\u00a0 Because that is the wish I have for all who parent autism, live autism, educate autism, advocate autism and embrace autism.\u00a0 It is also my wish for those who see autism as unpretty.I feel in order to exist as a community, it requires us all to speak our own truths as we see fit in a respectful manner.\u00a0 A manner which takes into consideration that none of us are an expert in autism.\u00a0 Autism, and Autistics, cannot be contained in one definition, one area of expertise, one science, one belief system, one treatment plan, one advocacy campaign, or one collective understanding.\u00a0 As in all meaningful exchanges, not only should we speak our own truths, we must listen and accept the truth of others.To consider the impossibility for any forum to contain both parents and Autistics is as\u00a0devastating as either group not considering the natural differences in each other\u2019s experiences.\u00a0 Such exclusivity of what some see as polar opposites of the autism community is as deadly as our country\u2019s inability to come together and discuss gun control in a civil and respectful way.\u00a0 It suggests that my own home is considered a battleground between my love as a parent and the individual rights of my daughter to be an Autistic.\u00a0 Absurd.\u00a0 What my home and my family live each day is no more open to debate than what an Autistic should be able to achieve in life.\u00a0 The answer to both is whatever works.\u00a0 [May I also add, that for gun control to be debated only by lawmakers, lobbyists and activists rather than including victims and citizens from our poorest city streets to the most affluent suburbs is equally ineffective.\u00a0 I digress\u2026]When my daughter was born with a chromosome deletion, doctors said that if she survived at all her life would be limited.\u00a0 She may never sit up, smile, walk or talk.\u00a0 It was devastating news.\u00a0 And as a mother, I can say this with sincerest honesty and truth \u2013 I wanted my daughter fixed.\u00a0\u00a0The layers of what that means to me and my daughter cannot be experienced, understood or explained by anyone outside of us.\u00a0 And it does not afford any person the right to judge that onion.\u00a0 I can only touch upon the intent of\u00a0such desire by saying that I chose for her to be cut open and given a life-sustaining feeding tube. \u00a0I chose for her to be cut open again and her heart repaired so that she could run and play as she grew older.\u00a0 I chose these \u2018cures\u2019 to allow her the most opportunity for an enriching life \u2013 whatever that would mean for her.\u00a0 As a mother, I feel that is my greatest responsibility.When autism was included in her list of many diagnoses, yes, I wanted to fix that, too.\u00a0 I wanted to learn everything I could about autism so that I could get RM the treatments that would afford her a better life.\u00a0 I wanted her to be successful, to be active in our family life, to fulfill every ounce of potential within her to live her best life for her.\u00a0 Never have I set out to change who my child is meant to be,\u00a0rather as her parent I feel the responsibility lies in adapting to her needs and her autism.\u00a0 That requires an open mind, an open heart and the building of a new parenting framework.\u00a0 Simply put, this is not the parenting we expected and therefore as parents we\u00a0have much to learn in order to grow with our autistic children.\u00a0 It\u2019s a process, a journey.\u00a0 Sometimes we get it right, and there are times we fail miserably.\u00a0 With hope and love, we try again.Though I am no expert, I have learned enough about autism to know that my daughter is amazing regardless of the challenges she faces.\u00a0 And though it has taken time for me as a parent to digest it, I know that autism is as much of who she is as the freckles on her nose.\u00a0 It took time for me to learn this framework of parenting autism that differentiates between fixing a problem and growing a useful tool box.\u00a0 It took time for me to unlearn the unpretty\u00a0and embrace the unfettered.\u00a0 It took time to\u00a0expect RM to\u00a0work hard for what she wanted\u00a0instead of making excuses for why she couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 At her pace, with her own tool box.\u00a0 For us, that meant advocating for an outplacement autism school.\u00a0 Not to fix her, but to unfetter her.As a parent, I am thrilled to learn as much as I can from self-advocates because I want my daughter to grow up empowered as an Autistic.\u00a0 I have come to rely on the useful perspectives of those who choose to speak\u00a0their truths\u00a0and work within the autism community to bring us together toward a common goal of understanding the very real spectrum of this spectrum.\u00a0 I rely on my fellow parents to walk this road with me and I rely on Autistics who have navigated the road ahead to guide me.My wish is not for compromise of truths, but communion.\u00a0 I wish for a universal\u00a0agreement that the unpretty is unproductive.I am trying.\u00a0 Every day I am trying to grow my children.\u00a0 I am trying to forge a better path for my autistic daughter.\u00a0 I am trying to share our truth and I am listening in effort to understand yours.\u00a0 Sometimes I get it right.\u00a0 Many times I falter.\u00a0 But I am trying.This is my unfettered and sometimes unpretty truth as an autism mom.This is my unfettered autism:", "outgoing_links": ["http://cmkaa.org"], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2013/01/11/unfettered-autism/", "title": "Unfettered by the\u00a0Unpretty"},

TAKE ME TO THE FREAKING WIZARD.Oh.What?I see.It\u2019s me.I was\u00a0searching for what was there all along.\u00a0 I just didn\u2019t understand that I possessed the brains, heart, courage, and power to make it all happen.Yes, I needed a little help from a Good Witch and countless other parents who shared their own experiences. Yes, I needed the bat once in a while\u00a0to ward off The Flying Monkeys.\u00a0 Yes, I needed to educate myself.But in the end, it took only a few emails and a bucket of water.Because really, truly, I had The Power all along.So do YOU.So do YOU, my friend.Don\u2019t let the cast of characters in Oz make you feel less than THE MOST IMPORTANT, EFFECTIVE AND POWERFUL MEMBER OF YOUR CHILD\u2019S EDUCATIONAL TEAM.The Scarecrow is not smarter than you.The Tin Man does not love your child.The Cowardly Lion will never have your back.At the end of the day your brains, love for your child, and courage to take charge of the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) are the most tangible and relevant elements in a land somewhere over the rainbow.When I felt like the characters I faced were not acting in good faith, I opened up The Curtain using The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\u00a0 I used a State Complaint and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to pour a bucket of water on The Witch.\u00a0 You see, these are free and fairly straightforward tools that were created for ME.\u00a0 They are nothing to be afraid of and they are actually very easy to use.\u00a0 And if you feel that you aren\u2019t sure of how to use them correctly, there are state and federal officials who get paid to enforce IDEA and FOIA.\u00a0 That is their job.\u00a0 They are not Flying Monkeys, THEY WORK FOR YOU.Actually, everyone involved in your child\u2019s education work for you, too.\u00a0 Even Scarecrow, Tin Man, and The Cowardly Lion.\u00a0 They are your employees.\u00a0 YOU are The Wizard.I finally learned that the IEP is my own legally binding magic wand and as The Wizard I write the goals that dictate the services my child receives. \u00a0If district and school staff are unable to execute programming that allows my child to access the general curriculum as outlined in her goals \u2013 separate goals for each core curriculum standard* \u2013 then I grab the bucket of water and pour.There is no one to fight.\u00a0 There never was.\u00a0 I just needed to figure out that I AM THE WIZARD.I.

\u2013\u00a0\u201cDETA1LS\u201d.It truly is in the details, isn\u2019t it?When I look at my beautiful baby girl, now five-years-old and full of life and possibilities, I see all the details.\u00a0 Every time I look at her.\u00a0 There is never such a thing as a glimpse of this child.I see every new freckle that has taken up residence on the apples of her cheeks.\u00a0 I see the speckles of gold and brown in her radiantly green eyes.\u00a0 I see how every wisp of her thick brown hair falls across her brow.I see every moment of pain, every scar on her chest and belly.\u00a0 I see every instance in which that belly rumbled in hunger and jiggled in laughter.I see the pride in her smile for every word she managed to form and was understood.\u00a0 I see every wrinkle of her nose for every frustration when she was not heard.I see ears that beckon me to nibble on them because of the way they stick out and pop right into my mouth when I hold her close.\u00a0 I see little rosebud lips that worked for years to coordinate something so simple as blowing out a candle.\u00a0 I see her little overlapping piggie toes that she sticks in my nose after a tubby so that I can tickle them and pretend to gobble them up.And I see her one perfectly unique pinkie finger with a perfect hooked little nail that tells the world she is one of a kind.\u00a0 And she is mine.Today we took a drive up to Boston Children\u2019s to see a Plastics guru we shall call \u201cDoctor T\u201d who has made a career of changing little lives with the most delicate precision of nips and stitches.\u00a0 I knew of him by way of my sister who lost a fight with a lawn tractor a few years ago.\u00a0 This was the surgeon who specializes in microsurgery and helped to save her leg.\u00a0 While taking my sister to a follow-up visit way back then, she stopped to show me a side room in the office.\u00a0 It was filled with shelves of castings of congenital hand and foot deformities that Doctor T and his partner had transformed.\u00a0 It was amazing.\u00a0 I felt an instant ease there.\u00a0 Like it was meant to be.\u00a0 We left the appointment knowing that I would someday be back to see Doctor T with my baby girl.We\u2019ve had our share of \u2018specialists\u2019 for RM.\u00a0 Most have been total blessings that not only have cared for her, but have shaped our lives as a family.\u00a0 They have sat with us through heavy times and listened to us and our opinions on how to best care for RM.\u00a0 Today was a familiar visit, and we knew right away that we were in the right place with the right person to care for RM.We talked about how her pinkie causes her pain when its nail is easily caught on things and tears.\u00a0 We chatted about her adorable overlapping piggies and hammertoes.\u00a0 We talked about options, about the importance of certain things that could wait until a time when RM could cognitively participate in the decision-making process.\u00a0 There was never a moment of urgency or fear.\u00a0 It all felt right.\u00a0 There was no rush, the conversation was never hurried.\u00a0 The details were all there.We decided to take the most minimally-invasive approach to start.\u00a0 We will let Doctor T remove a portion of nail-bed that appears to be nonfunctional and he will replace with a skin graft.\u00a0 So tiny, but could make all the difference.\u00a0 You know, details.\u00a0 He heard us speak of the importance of keeping as much of who she is intact.He listened to our concerns about recovery.\u00a0 How would he cast her hand so that she couldn\u2019t ruin his hard work?\u00a0 You know, we\u2019re talking about autism here.\u00a0 It can\u2019t be that easy.\u00a0 \u201cNo problem,\u201d he said.\u00a0 He will cast all four fingers together so she cannot disturb the graft.\u00a0 See?\u00a0 Details.When I asked where he thought he\u2019d take the skin graft from he initially replied with the standard groin/hip area.\u00a0 But then he stopped mid-sentence and said, \u201cWell, wait \u2013 she has scars from previous surgeries, right?\u201d\u00a0 Well, duh, lots.\u00a0 Pick one.\u00a0 Aflutter with this whole process of actually talking about details it seemed my brain finally caught up to the conversation and I blurted out, \u201cHer feeding tube site!\u00a0 There\u2019s a bunch of extra skin there, it\u2019s like a second belly button!\u201dWith a quick nod and a peek of RM\u2019s belly it was settled.\u00a0 \u201cOh yeah\u2026 That\u2019s perfect right there.\u00a0 And I can take what I need for the finger and leave just a nice little straight line.\u00a0 You\u2019ll barely see it.\u201dYou see, her pinkie is something she was born with and to us it matters.\u00a0 We love it.\u00a0 It\u2019s special.\u00a0 But\u00a0that \u2018second belly button\u2019 was something done to her and we have no problem watching it disappear.And there you have it.\u00a0 Those crazy little details.RM gets a pain-free pinkie that is still uniquely her own and a chance at wearing a bikini some day.Over the SGM\u2019s cold, lifeless body.But you know\u2026. details.\u00a0[Ed note: Please don\u2019t forget to lend your

{"date": "December 11, 2011", "body": "Since I began advocating for military kids with autism, the question I am asked most frequently is:\u00a0 Why are the rates of autism higher for military kids?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it chemical exposure?\u00a0 Vaccines?\u00a0 WTF?The rates are not necessarily higher, my friends.\u00a0 It\u2019s complicated.But I will start with the statistic itself and how it came to be.In 2007, a Marine spouse and mother of a child with autism filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for data on the number of military dependent children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.From the period of June 2006 through June 2008, there were a total of 13,243 active duty dependents with autism.\u00a0 If you take the total number of active duty military dependents\u00a0and divide by the number of those with an ASD diagnosis\u00a0you get a simple equation:1,177,990 active duty dependents / 13,243 active duty dependents with\u00a0Autism Spectrum Disorder\u00a0=1 in 88.The catch here is that TRICARE\u00a0required a minimum of three claims for service using an ASD\u00a0diagnostic code within a 24-month period to be included in the data.\u00a0 A trip to the ER for a broken leg wouldn\u2019t count even if the injury was incurred because your kid with autism thought he could fly.\u00a0 In layman\u2019s terms, unless the child with autism was actually receiving appropriate autism treatment being administered via TRICARE, the child was not counted.\u00a0 I can tell you my own daughter is just one example of those not included in the 1 in 88 because she receives all of her autism therapies at an outplacement school. \u00a0(Remember, we are an Active Guard Reserve family and do not live near a military base.)\u00a0 Can you imagine how many kids are missing in this TRICARE-driven data?Out of the 13,243 active duty kids with autism only 1,374 were enrolled in the Extended Care Health Option (ECHO).\u00a0 ECHO is the separate arm of TRICARE\u00a0that theoretically provides autism services and classifies them as special education rather than medically necessary.\u00a0 I could go on for days how ECHO is messed up, but the short version is that enrollment requires prior admission into a discriminatory program called Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) that identifies your special needs child and is supposed to make sure that the family is only placed at duty stations that have appropriate services and facilities available to the child.\u00a0 The dirty little secret is that soldiers are reluctant to apply because it has the potential to really screw your military career opportunities.Now let\u2019s talk dependents of retirees.The same report listed 8,784 retiree dependents with autism for that time period.\u00a0 Imagine how many there really are today.\u00a0 The math starts to get really nutty, but if you attempt to calculate how the retiree dependents contribute to the overall statistic using DoD numbers of retirees, you get an even higher rate of 1 in 67.Let\u2019s say you serve in the military for twenty years and you are eligible to retire.\u00a0 You and your eligible dependents will still receive TRICARE standard medical benefits, but your parting gift is the end of ECHO autism services.\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 Gone.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter if your child with autism is five or fifteen.\u00a0 You get nothing.Did you know that there are now countless \u2018retirees\u2019 that didn\u2019t quite make it to twenty years of service and are left without special needs benefits for their dependents?\u00a0 Why, you ask?\u00a0 Because there is such a thing as a \u2018medical retiree\u2019 \u2013 a soldier who is forced to retire due to injury or disease.\u00a0 They also lose ECHO.\u00a0 Yes, that means a Wounded Warrior who retires from service with a special needs child loses all special needs services for that child.So you still want to know the answer to why the rates of autism appear higher than the civilian population?\u00a0 I don\u2019t have the exact answer.\u00a0 No one does.\u00a0 And frankly, I don\u2019t really care right now because right now we have treatments that work \u2013 yet our military kids are being denied access to them.So for the 1 in 88, can we please just throw these kids a bone?\u00a0 Isn\u2019t autism hard enough?\u00a0 Aren\u2019t deployments and Mom or Dad being gone for a year while getting shot at kinda sucky?\u00a0 Why on earth would we provide medical care for our wounded warriors but not our warrior kids?The Caring for Military Kids with Autism Act (CMKAA) H.R. 2288 makes autism therapies, including Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), a part of TRICARE standard medical benefits.\u00a0 It removes the dollar cap and allows for a child to receive the recommended 30-40 hours per week of services.\u00a0 Most importantly, removing the autism therapies from ECHO means that the services are still available to retiree dependents.This isn\u2019t rocket science.\u00a0 It\u2019s simply the right thing to do.Please show your support for CMKAA by clicking \u2013> HERE\u00a0<\u2013.You will be taken directly to an

T-minus four hours! Move your ass!\u201cIf it was a Saturday show I was psyched.\u00a0 It meant I could work load-in and watch barely two dozen stagehands construct the most sophisticated sets and lights with stairways, exploding elements and speakers\u00a0each the\u00a0size of a greyhound bus.\u00a0 It meant all day backstage watching the contents of\u00a0three or four trailer trucks choreographed with miraculous precision into a seamless 90-minute dance of pure showbiz magic.I loved my time as an event security supervisor.\u00a0 A huge departure from my 9-to-5 in finance, it was exciting and strenuous work.\u00a0 And on occasion it was a little dangerous.\u00a0 But nothing could have kept me away.\u00a0 I had the unique experience of sitting right in front of a small theater performance by Dave Matthews Band, it was my job to drool over\u00a0Dave inconspicuously\u00a0while keeping the rest of the ladies from attacking him.\u00a0 No complaints about that.\u00a0 I shook hands with my idol\u00a0Sarah McLachlan (I used to be a singer, too, and LOVE her music) and I had the opportunity to tell her how much her talent meant to me.\u00a0 Over the years in that business, I enjoyed meeting many talented people who inspired me.\u00a0\u00a0I learned so much about what it takes backstage to pull off a performance that people can really be\u00a0inspired by, not just entertained.\u00a0 An evening that will stay with the audience forever, a true lasting memory.So here I am today.\u00a0 Working backstage once again, but this time it\u2019s a very different venue.\u00a0 A Congressional briefing.\u00a0 Congress.\u00a0 Pause.\u00a0 Breathe.\u00a0 Yeah, seriously \u2013 CONGRESS.\u00a0 ME.\u00a0 How the hell did I get through security HERE?It started in a very unlikely place.\u00a0 Not on Capitol Hill, no millions paid to lobbying firms.\u00a0 It started in someone\u2019s living room in Connecticut.\u00a0 With one Congressman.\u00a0 And one family\u2019s story.\u00a0 Ours.Way back, what seems like lightyears\u00a0ago last February 2011, SGM and I attended an evening of discussion between families living with autism and our Congressman, John Larson (D-CT).\u00a0 I had already done two of these kinds of events with other Congressmen in Connecticut and at each\u00a0I had walked away feeling good that one more legislator\u00a0had now heard about the unique challenges facing military families with autism.\u00a0 But this exchange was different.\u00a0 Something beyond bending the Congressman\u2019s ear had taken place.\u00a0 He was moved by the numbers. 1 in 88.\u00a0 He was shocked by the lack of access to care. \u00a0Less than 10 %.\u00a0 What likely stirred him the most was that my husband standing beside me, having served twenty-four years and three overseas deployments, could not retire because he would lose what little services are available to treat his daughter\u2019s autism.A few days later, a phone call from Congressman Larson\u2019s staff: \u201cCan I ask you some more questions?\u201d\u00a0 Ask me anything. I have been waiting so long to tell the world.\u00a0 \u201cHow does a military family go about getting autism therapies through TRICARE?\u201dOMG.\u00a0 Seriously?\u00a0 Do you have a few hours?\u201cWell,\u201d I began, \u201cit amounts to jumping through flaming rings of fire while blindfolded with your feet and hands bound with duct tape while your child with autism is left spinning in a corner and your husband dodges IEDs in Afghanistan.\u00a0 Do you want to hear more?\u201dAnd so it began.\u00a0 By June, Congressman Larson\u2019s staff and the Government Relations team at Autism Speaks along with myself and Marine Corps Warrior Spouse Karen Driscoll\u00a0had finished the draft language of a bill and it was now ready to drop.The several months that followed felt like a kick in the throat.\u00a0 We rode a rollercoaster through the debt-ceiling crisis in August, threats to cut the defense budget and then it was the holidays and Congress was on recess.\u00a0 I had been told more than a few times that this bill\u2019s chances were plainly slim-to-none.\u00a0 With all of the budget cuts looming, our military families with autism just weren\u2019t on the radar.\u00a0 This show might get cancelled before it even begins.But I still showed up to work backstage.\u00a0 I felt it was my duty.\u00a0 I still asked folks to contact their member of Congress and ask them to support HR2288\u00a0\u2013 the Caring for Military Kids with Autism Act (CMKAA).\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t give up.\u00a0 I had some help, too.\u00a0\u00a0Diary of a Mom,\u00a0Try Defying Gravity, Hopeful Parents, Lou\u2019s Land, stark. raving. mad. mommy.\u00a0and RANTS FROM MOMMYLAND, just to name a few.\u00a0 Like professional stagehands, the coordination was incredible, the focus and dedication to making it all fit together was impressive.\u00a0 The set being constructed was coming along.Autism Speaks stepped up in a major way and began putting the word out about the bill.\u00a0 They highlighted our efforts on Pearl Harbor Day\u00a0with Autism Votes\u00a0creating an Action Alert with easy access for people across the country to contact their legislators and ask for support of CMKAA.\u00a0 We now have 35 Cosponsors from both sides of the aisle agreeing that our military families are deserving of treatments for their children with autism.Backstage over the last several weeks, a handful of us military parents who signed up for load-in have been calling members of Congress to personally invite them to this briefing.\u00a0 We have politely badgered some staffers more than once.\u00a0 Personally, I have tweeted and facebook\u2019d the crap out of every Member of both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.\u00a0 Because we need an audience for the show to go on.On Tuesday, the lights will go up in a room on Capitol Hill filled with superstars from across the country.\u00a0 You might recognize of few of the names on the set list, but I doubt you\u2019d know the major stars until you hear their stories.\u00a0 But trust me. Their stories will have you on your feet screaming for this bill to pass.\u00a0 It\u2019ll be an event that stays with you for a lifetime.\u00a0 I know it will stay with me forever.\u00a0 I have never worked so hard on a backstage load-in.So what do I wish most\u00a0for\u00a0people to learn from my story?\u00a0That it is the backstage crew that makes the magic happen.\u00a0 That EACH AND EVERY PERSON can make a difference by speaking up.\u00a0 That working backstage might be the most life-changing job you will ever have.I want you to hear that a stay-at-home-mom (or dad) who hasn\u2019t earned a paycheck in nearly ten years can DO something just by sharing their story.Backstage is where it all begins.[To learn more about the Congressional briefing on Autism and its impact on our military families, go \u2013> HERE\u00a0<\u2013.\u00a0 You can read the copy of the bill and find out ways to support CMKAA \u2013> HERE <\u2013.

there I stood still wiping tears away when he grabbed my hand, put his other arm around me and said, \u201cThank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Rachel.\u201dAll I can say after that was how relieved I was when I was not next up to speak.\u00a0 Rather it was time for Karen Driscoll, Rock Star Autism Mama from ACT Today for Military Families, to do her thing and educate all those in attendance\u00a0(some legislative staffers, some folks from TRICARE and other organizations) about the reality of the ECHO program segregation of autism treatments.\u00a0 As usual, she nailed it and there was little to discuss.\u00a0 Autism therapies in ECHO = WRONG.We were also honored to have Dr. Geraldine Dawson, Chief Science Officer of Autism Speaks, speaking on the science of autism.\u00a0 You see, the DoD has long been arguing the validity and effectiveness of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA).\u00a0 No worries, Friends.\u00a0 We now have permanent record of Dr. Dawson speaking at this briefing in support of military families having access to ABA as \u201cthe\u00a0safe, effective medically prescribed standard of autism care.\u201d\u00a0 Hooah, Geri!\u00a0 THANK YOU!It was my turn.\u00a0 People, let me tell you, I was also on a mission.\u00a0 I had no doubt that my message was clear and would be heard once again \u2013 NO military family deserves to be denied appropriate, accessible best-practice medical care.\u00a0 Military families with autism are proud families, too.\u00a0 We want the best futures possible for our kids.\u00a0 We want to serve our country, too.\u00a0 And when our soldier\u2019s work is done, we want him or her\u00a0to retire knowing that\u00a0they have\u00a0earned\u00a0a secure future of care for their children.Though my speech came easy to me, I had rehearsed it a thousand times in prior weeks; I was not prepared for the unexpected flash of PTSD when I arrived at the words, \u201cNow a Sergeant Major, it was only a month into my husband\u2019s second tour in Afghanistan when he received my call to tell him \u2013 his baby girl had autism.\u201dI broke down in sobbing tears again.\u00a0 So did most of the room I was told.\u00a0 I could no longer see through the fishbowl tears that had settled on my eyeballs, but I take their word for it.\u00a0 By the end of my speech, I felt pretty confident that I was heard and it was probably the first standing ovation I have\u00a0ever received outside of singing The National Anthem (and those suckers had to stand).Next up was Jeremy Hilton, a retired Navy veteran and stay-at-home-dad to a beautiful girl with autism.\u00a0 His wife is active duty Air Force.\u00a0 Jeremy spoke of the painfully long process to obtain the correct diagnosis of autism and went on to explain what little services they were able to access via ECHO \u2013 just four hours per month at a provider that was three hours away.Karen Driscoll spoke again.\u00a0 This time she shared her military family\u2019s story.\u00a0 She spoke of her husband\u2019s service.\u00a0\u00a0Jerry is\u00a0a career Marine who has served two combat tours in Iraq as a MEDEVAC pilot, flying into hostile areas to retrieve our wounded.\u00a0 He was doing just that when he learned of his own son\u2019s autism diagnosis.\u00a0 Karen spoke clearly and honestly about \u2018the right thing to do\u2019 in moving our legislators to take action and pass HR2288.\u00a0 Thank you, Karen.\u00a0 You are a force.The briefing wrapped up with two more families that came forward to the podium.\u00a0 An Army wife and mom came forward and spoke of the lack of support and services for her child with autism.\u00a0 She was angry.\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame her.But our last speaker was perhaps the most affecting.\u00a0 A veteran of nearly 30 years came forward holding a picture of himself and his son with autism.\u00a0 Scott spoke of reaching his 28th year of service to his country and preparing to retire.\u00a0 When he presented himself for the retirement physical, he learned he had lung cancer.\u00a0 And he was relieved.\u00a0 Relieved.\u00a0 About having cancer.\u00a0 WHY?\u00a0 Because it meant he had to stay in the service to receive treatment, and it meant that his son would continue to qualify for autism treatment via ECHO.\u00a0 CANCER.\u00a0 Scott may be one of the most loving parents I have ever met.\u00a0 He felt blessed by cancer so that his son could be treated for his autism just a little longer.\u00a0 And yes, THANK GOD, Scott is doing well today.So you see, this briefing was kind of a big deal and I have so much more to share with you about my trip to DC.\u00a0 But I have a lot of work still ahead, and so I will have to fill you in on the rest a little bit later.THANK YOU to everyone who has supported me and encouraged me throughout this journey to help my fellow military brothers, sisters and children.\u00a0 I have gained more blessings and learned more about life through these struggles than I ever could have without my daughter\u2019s autism.By the way, today is our Diagnosis Day.\u00a0 Groundhog Day.\u00a0 But for the first time in two years, I feel like I have woken up to a new day.\u00a0 The curse and darkness of that word \u2018autism\u2019 have been lifted.\u00a0 I now know without a doubt that my daughter and everything that makes her who she is, has been and shall continue to be, the most absolutely perfect gift God could have ever given me.Cheers, my friends!Rachel", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2012/02/02/the-briefing/", "title": "The Briefing"},
{"date": "January 31, 2012", "body": "Of all titles I hold, Mother is the one that has brought me here today to speak to you.\u00a0 I am an Army wife as well, but that is a role I chose shortly after 9/11 with full knowledge of what I was getting myself into.\u00a0 War was imminent, terror threat levels were the new casual conversation and I was marrying a career soldier who told me his duty would always come first.\u00a0 And I signed up for that.I signed up to serve my country, too.And when my husband ran off with the other love of his life, the Army, to fight on the battlefields of Afghanistan as an Infantry Platoon Sergeant, I proudly kissed him goodbye as he patted my belly and told our daughter to behave for mama. He told her he\u2019d be back to meet her when his work was done.My husband was due home on leave for my daughter\u2019s birth the following summer of 2006.\u00a0 He would arrive a day late to meet her, but in military life it was understood that a day late was far better than not at all.Our daughter, RM, was born with special needs and required intensive medical care.\u00a0 She barely survived those first weeks and yet at 15 days old, my husband kissed her goodbye and headed back to Afghanistan.\u00a0 He would return home again on a Red Cross alert just days later as our baby girl began slipping away.\u00a0 My husband remained by her side for another two weeks of emergency leave to watch her inch her way to stable condition before leaving her in her hospital bed once again to return to war.\u00a0 Because that is what we signed up for.It was my job to serve on the home-front.\u00a0 Our daughter had a feeding tube and was in congestive heart failure.\u00a0 She had open-heart surgery at 4 months old, but by then Daddy was home to help and RM\u2019s health was improving.\u00a0 Not once did we worry about finding her the medical care she required.\u00a0 We felt blessed to be a military family and often joked that we only paid eight dollars for hospital parking for open-heart surgery \u2013 as it should be when you serve your country.In early 2010, under falling snowflakes my husband kissed his healthy, beautiful little girl goodbye once more as the battalion loaded up and headed back to Afghanistan.\u00a0 This was Army life, so we wiped our tears and held our heads high, proudly waving to Daddy as they pulled away.Now a Sergeant Major, it was only a month into my husband\u2019s second tour in Afghanistan when he received my call to tell him \u2013 his baby girl had autism.\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d he said. \u201cPlease. Please tell me that she isn\u2019t going to fall down the deep dark hole of autism.\u201dBut I had no answers for him.\u00a0 I had no hope to offer.I had no points of contact as an active duty Guard family. \u00a0I had no one to ask, \u201cWhat do I do next?\u201d\u00a0 For the next several months, there were many more phone calls to my husband in Afghanistan, and still I had no answers to offer him.What I had learned was that autism therapies were largely unavailable to our military families.\u00a0 I had learned that the small amount of services offered through the Extended Care Health Option were grossly inadequate and often impossible for military families on the move to access.My husband has served honorably for 25 years.\u00a0 He was a scout sniper in Desert Storm.\u00a0 He has earned a bronze star, an army commendation medal and a combat infantryman badge with star for his service throughout two tours in Afghanistan. He has also been awarded a meritorious service medal, three more army commendation medals, six army achievement medals, and eight good conduct medals.\u00a0 He has earned the right to retire.\u00a0 But he cannot.\u00a0 Because he worries every day for our daughter and her future and he knows that he loses what little services are available to treat her autism if he retires.\u00a0\u00a0He worries every day that if he gets sick or injured and is medically retired, that he loses that coverage.There is one more tour to Afghanistan on our horizon.\u00a0 And my Command Sergeant Major will go once again when duty calls.\u00a0 Because that is what he signed up for.\u00a0\u00a0That is what our service as a family requires of us.But not being given access to the care our children need is NOT what we signed up for.\u00a0 This is NOT what any military family deserves.\u00a0 We sacrifice so much \u2013 YEARS at a time and we complain little.Since my daughter\u2019s diagnosis of autism, it has been my determination to see that the right thing is done here.\u00a0 Because if you ask any military family what they DID sign up for, they will tell you \u2013\u00a0freedom \u2013\u00a0yours and mine.And as a mother, I simply cannot let any of our military kids go without the treatments they so desperately need to which their service to our country undoubtedly entitles them to.\u00a0 Because they did not sign up for THIS.", "outgoing_links": ["https://stimcity.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/cmkaa-briefing.jpg"], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2012/01/31/congressional-speech/", "title": "What I Signed Up\u00a0For"},
{"date": "February 4, 2012", "body": "[Click above\u00a0image to\u00a0see coverage of HR2288 on Andrea Mitchell Reports\u00a0MSNBC]TRICARE\u00a0does not cover autism therapies. A separate arm of services called the Extended Care Health Option (ECHO) which is secondary to enrollment in the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) does offer what amounts to an average of 11 hours of ABA therapy per week \u2013 far below the recommended 25-40 hours per week.With HR2288\u00a0\u2013 the Caring for Military Kids with Autism Act, we are asking that TRICARE\u00a0take autism therapies out of ECHO and place them as medically necessary as part of TRICARE standard \u2013 thus making these proven treatments available to all active duty and retiree dependents and removing the dollar cap on care.ECHO is not available to retirees.Wounded Warriors who are forced to retire due to injury or disease do not have access to autism services.\u00a0 According to TRICARE/DoD data, less than 10% of active duty families who do have access to ECHO are accessing autism treatments, yet none are receiving the recommended amount because of the dollar cap ($36,000 per year).Also, families accessing autism therapies under ECHO are forced to choose between ECHO benefits in order to maximize autism therapies.\u00a0 For every dollar of ECHO benefits used towards other services, a dollar of ABA is essentially taken away.\u00a0 We seek to change that.\u00a0 Autism therapies should not have barriers to receive care, they should be equally accessible to the military family as would treatment for heart defects or a broken arm.With the advocacy efforts of Autism Speaks, 29 states have now passed insurance reform to include autism therapies as medically necessary \u2013 we are seeking to do the same for our military families.\u00a0 This is not an issue of civilian versus military, it is an effort to level the playing field for ALL children with autism.\u00a0 This effort neither detracts from or argues the continued efforts to make proven treatments readily available to all.\u00a0 In fact,\u00a0for TRICARE\u00a0to step up with best-practice standard of care for autism treatment, they would be taking the opportunity to once again set the standard for medical care throughout the insurance industry.Thank you to Peter Bell, Executive Vice President\u00a0of Programs and Services for Autism Speaks,\u00a0for\u00a0his support!\u00a0 It is the hard work of everyone at Autism Speaks taking the charge to make this right, along with all of the tremendous work they do for families across the globe, that gives me hope.And my absolute sincerest gratitude to Ms. Andrea Mitchell at MSNBC.\u00a0 Andrea was not only a gracious host, but she is personally committed to autism awareness for all of our families living with autism.My thanks to Marvin, the lovely gentleman who drove me to and from the airport.\u00a0 And many thanks to the entire team at Andrea Mitchell Reports for welcoming me and my story and treating me with respect and kindness.Cheers.[Don\u2019t forget!

{"date": "February 7, 2012", "body": "\u201cI want to tell you that Rachel is incredibly special in so many ways, and yet I want you to know that she\u2019s not special at all. \u00a0I want you to know that there is nothing in her that is not in each and every single one of us, and that once it\u2019s awakened, it can move mountains.\u201d \u2013 DOAM.I grew up the last of five kids who were eleven, nine, seven and five years older than me.\u00a0 From as far back as I can really remember my childhood they were already growing up and moving out.\u00a0 I always felt so far behind.I was the awkwardly tall girl in elementary school.\u00a0 Tall and fat.\u00a0 Like uber-fat and had short hair and I liked to play football with the boys in my neighborhood.\u00a0 Can you see where this is going?Anyways, my siblings gave me a lot to live up to.\u00a0 My oldest brother got like one answer wrong on the Math SATs and is literally one of the nicest human beings on the planet.\u00a0 My other brother, devastatingly handsome and the football star in high school, was the hilarious smart-ass who\u00a0has always been much more brilliant than he has ever given himself credit for.\u00a0 My oldest sister has worked for MIT and other top slots as a business recruiter.\u00a0 My other sister graduated college with a dual degree and now works in\u00a0state advocacy for persons with disabilities.\u00a0 There isn\u2019t a dud in the bunch.Then there\u2019s me.\u00a0 I will let you in on a little secret.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t graduate high school.\u00a0 There.\u00a0 It\u2019s out.Not for lack of trying.\u00a0 Well, actually that\u2019s exactly why I didn\u2019t graduate.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t try.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t like school back then.\u00a0 I found it so hard to pay attention in the classroom when my social anxiety and chubby sense of humor got the best of me.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t say I was the class clown but I wasn\u2019t exactly quiet and focused on academics.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t a popular kid but I suppose I was well-liked enough.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t a trouble-maker but I was not a saint.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t drink, I have never tried\u00a0drugs and I always had a decent part-time job throughout high school. \u00a0SGM says it sounds like I was Switzerland \u2013 kind of a neutral entity.\u00a0 He pretty much nailed it.The truth was that I didn\u2019t want to try and then find out that I wasn\u2019t in the same league as my siblings.\u00a0 So I rebelled a bit, found myself skipping classes and then\u00a0manipulating the vice principal\u00a0to avoid\u00a0Saturday detention.\u00a0 (I\u00a0had been\u00a0teaching Catholic Catechism classes at my church which I really loved doing and convinced the administrator at school that I was a good kid already doing community service.)My guidance counselor was kind of a joke.\u00a0 My senior year he tried to convince me to repeat because I was a half-credit shy of my English requirements.\u00a0 I told him plainly that I spoke the language fairly well having been born here and that my writing was sufficient enough to\u00a0score him a\u00a0beautiful letter of resignation if and when he grew a conscience and decided he had chosen the wrong profession.\u00a0 We did not part ways on good terms.I decided instead to take the easy way out and spend two Saturday mornings pencilling in some bubbles on the GED.\u00a0 I passed, with Honors which I found rather absurd at the time that there even was such a classification.The short version of the next several years is that I tried a couple of different colleges with really no success.\u00a0 My grades were iffy and I just wasn\u2019t finding my place.\u00a0 But I worked and had some good jobs, some fun jobs, and I was independent.\u00a0 I just hadn\u2019t really grown up yet.Then I met my husband.\u00a0 It was a done deal from that first date.\u00a0 We were living together within two weeks and within a year we had a house, I was raising a teenage stepdaughter and expecting a baby of my own.\u00a0 By then it wasn\u2019t a matter of when I was going to be grown up \u2013 I was a grown up.But marriage and motherhood suited me.\u00a0 Military life worked okay for me, too.\u00a0 I could appreciate the time apart from my husband while he was away, because it made the time together more precious.I went back to school again but this time I was motivated.\u00a0 I had a 4.0 first semester and at least nine years on every kid in my classes.\u00a0 I was accepted into the honor society Phi Theta Kappa.\u00a0 That\u2019s Phi Theta, not Phi Beta Kappa \u2013 I was attending community college.\u00a0 But do you know what the President of the school told us at our induction?\u00a0 He said, \u201cDo not ever believe that because you began here, that you have not earned the right to finish there.\u201d\u00a0 He was speaking of Harvard and Yale.\u00a0 It was a life-changing moment for me.\u00a0 After believing for so many years that I was not in control of my life possibilities, that instead there was some sort of station that I had already cemented myself within, I now was free to do or become anything I wanted.After I became pregnant with RM, and SGM was leaving for deployment number\u00a0one to Afghanistan, I understandably took a break from school.\u00a0 It was good timing and would allow me to process the possibilities of what to pursue next.\u00a0 But RM\u2019s arrival was a complicated one, and the road since has been bumpy.\u00a0 School would have to wait.When my daughter was diagnosed with autism and I found out what little services are available to our military families, I was OUTRAGED.\u00a0 I mean, seriously?\u00a0 My husband gets shot at by Taliban and our kid gets left behind on the battlefield back at home?\u00a0 So. Not. Cool.But who am I?\u00a0 What could I possibly do to change this cluster%#@&?Well, actually, little ol\u2019 me who never graduated high school and still has yet to earn a college degree, did do something about it.\u00a0 I spoke up.That\u2019s it.I just spoke up.\u00a0 I said THIS. IS. WRONG.\u00a0 I said our military families deserve better for their children with autism.There is not a class for this.\u00a0 Well, actually I am sure there is somewhere and it is probably very informative, but it is not a prerequisite to make the world a better place.So, whether you\u2019re a Late Bloomer like me, or you have advanced degrees in ass-kicking advocacy and legislative endeavors \u2013 do something.\u00a0 You are just that incredibly special in so many ways, and yet I want you to know that you\u2019re\u00a0not special at all.[Click \u2013> HERE <\u2013 to support HR2288 by asking your Member of Congress to move this bill forward!

{"date": "May 28, 2012", "body": "Happy Memorial Day Weekend, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Armed Services Committee Offices.My name is Rachel Kenyon. I am a proud and battle-tested Army wife and mom of two beautiful babes, one with autism.Currently, TRICARE military healthcare provides less than half the recommended treatments for autism, and only to children of active duty service members.Service members who retire after more than twenty years and Wounded Warriors forced to medically retire are stripped of what little treatment TRICARE allows via the Extended Care Health Option (ECHO).On Thursday, May 17, 2012, Congressman John Larson took to the House floor armed with embarrassingly large photos of our little family and made the case for Caring for Military Kids with Autism Act to be included as an amendment to the FY2013 NDAA. It worked, because for Mr. Larson, this had become personal. It worked because Rep. Tom Rooney had the courage to walk up to Chairman Buck McKeon and tell him it was personal. Mr. Rooney has two nephews with autism. Mr. McKeon did the right thing, because now he understood, it was personal. The amendment passed as part of the NDAA in the House.Senator Gillibrand attempted this past week to do the same in the Senate Armed Services Committee markup session. The amendment was rejected.I contact you today because this fight is so very personal for so many of us serving our country each day. Not only do I want my husband to feel that his more than 25 years of service warrant the medical care our daughter with autism needs, but I want my daughter to have the security of being able to access the tools that can give her a richer, more meaningful life.It\u2019s personal because I now hold 23,000 other children in my heart, and more than that many parents who serve our country. I love them as I love my own. I want them to feel proud of their country\u2019s service to them in return. I want them to sleep at night, knowing that though autism may have knocked on their door, they can live their lives to the fullest with the care they need and deserve. It\u2019s personal.I know once you read the\u00a0petition comments from your constituents, both military and civilian, you all will choose to do the right thing. To take this fight personally. To share with your fellow staffers and your Senators and Representatives that our families are proud. That our children are worthy. That if just one military child was denied the cancer treatments he or she needed, we would not be wasting time with emails and petitions. A true American who hears that 23,000 military children are being denied the medical standard of care for autism takes that personally. Well, for real American patriots, it is so very personal.I appreciate your time and I wish you all a fun, relaxing Memorial Weekend in remembrance of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.Our little family will be spending another weekend living with autism in our house and struggling to understand why we have to fight this battle, too.Best,Mrs. Rachel E.

{"date": "July 6, 2012", "body": "Washington, D.C. \u2013 Senator Jim Webb, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, moderated a hearing June 21st to examine the Department of Defense (DoD) TRICARE classification that Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is an educational intervention, not medically necessary treatment of autism, a complex neurological disorder.\u00a0 Because of this distinction, autism is the only medical condition segregated by DoD under the Extended Care Health Option (ECHO) which limits treatment to less than half what is recommend by the medical community for best outcome. Dependents of retirees including Wounded Warriors forced to medically retire are denied autism benefits entirely. \u00a0More than 23,500 military dependent children have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).[i]\u00a0 Currently, only 3,783 active duty dependents have accessed autism benefits under ECHO.[ii]Chairman Webb opened with strong support for military families with special needs. \u201cEnsuring that our uniformed personnel and their families receive first-rate healthcare is one of the critical elements in what I view as the military\u2019s moral contract with those who volunteer to serve our nation.\u201dIn April, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) which oversees the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program released the following[iii]: \u201cPreviously, ABA was considered to be an educational intervention and not covered under the FEHB Program. The Panel concluded that there is now sufficient evidence to categorize ABA as medical therapy.\u201d\u00a0 FEHB covers over 8 million Federal employees, retirees and their family members.\u00a0 Jeremy Hilton, father of a child with autism and other special needs, Navy veteran and 2012 Military Spouse of the Year, testified at the hearing on behalf of military families.\u00a0 \u201cWe now stand at a point where, without action by the Congress, we will soon see federal workers provided medically prescribed autism therapy for their children while military families receive either an inferior level of care or, as in the case of the retired veteran\u2019s child, receive no care.\u201dDr. Vera Tait, Associate Executive Director of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), testified[iv] to the effectiveness of ABA-based interventions as, \u201cwell-documented through a long history of research in university and community settings.\u201d Dr. Tait hailed ABA in addressing specific medical issues that must be dealt with through behavioral approach such as self-injurious behavior, feeding issues and malnutrition. \u00a0\u201cAAP has endorsed the use of ABA treatments when determined appropriate by physicians within a medical home.\u201d \u00a0Dr. Geraldine Dawson, Chief Science Officer for Autism Speaks, followed up with added significant medical basis for ABA: \u201c[ABA is] prescribed by a physician, delivered by a licensed clinical psychologist, or Board Certified Behavior Analyst, not necessarily a special educator, and requires many hours of intensive intervention not accommodated within an educational program.\u201d\u00a0 Dr. Dawson also testified to ABA\u2019s impact on brain development and its success in changing the pattern of brain activity in autistic children to normalize them over time.[v]So why is this issue still so problematic?\u00a0The DoD maintains their ground regarding ABA as having insufficient scientific evidence by using a dated report[vi] by Hayes Inc., an online database that provides health technology assessments for a fee. The ABA ratings report issued by Hayes to the DoD contains the following disclaimer: \u201cThis report is intended to provide research assistance and general information only. It is not intended to be used as the sole basis for determining coverage policy.\u201d[vii]\u00a0 When asked by Committee Members how long it would take DoD to review the current evidence-based data widely accepted by the medical community, Dr. Karen Guice, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Staff, replied, \u201cIt could take us a very long time, six months.\u201dSen. Gillibrand asserted that six months was too long. \u00a0\u201cThe fact that these therapies [ABA] actually work is the greatest hope that we have.\u00a0 So we shouldn\u2019t be denying them to any child, certainly not the child of a military family and certainly not the child of a wounded warrior.\u201d\u00a0 Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) agreed, \u201cThe hopes offered by ABA are impressive.\u201d\u00a0Senator Gillibrand asked Dr. Guice what the Committee could do legislatively to aid the DoD in expediting a review of current evidence but Guice declined the offer.\u00a0 Dr. Dawson concluded her testimony, \u201cThis is not a matter for further study. Action is needed to provide the quality of care our military families deserve and have earned.\u201d\u00a0In May, the Caring for Military Kids with Autism Act was passed in the House as an amendment to the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act with overwhelming bipartisan support of more than 70 cosponsors.\u00a0 Senator Gillibrand is spearheading the effort to pass a similar amendment in the Senate this summer.\n\n\n[i] According to DoD report dated 12 September 2011.\n\n\n[ii] Testimony submitted by Dr. Karen Guice, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Staff http://issuu.com/jeremyhilton/docs/tricare_statement_for_the_record_21_june_2012?mode=window&backgroundColor=%23222222\n\n\n[iii] http://www.opm.gov/carrier/carrier_letters/2012/2012-12a2.pdf\n\n\n[iv] http://issuu.com/jeremyhilton/docs/aap_statement_for_the_record_21_june_2012_hearing?mode=window&backgroundColor=%23222222\n\n\n[v] http://www.autismvotes.org/atf/cf/%7B2A179B73-96E2-44C3-8816-1B1C0BE5334B%7D/DoD.GeriDawson_SASC.6.21.2012.pdf\n\n\n[vi] Don Woody, Chief of TRICARE Appeals, 29 October 2010.\u00a0 Appeal letter to retiree family stating TRICARE denial of ABA treatment as medically necessary using the Hayes Rating.\n\n\n[vii] United States District Court testimony in dispute of Hayes report regarding ABA.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_edn1", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_edn2", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_edn3", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_edn4", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_edn5", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_edn6", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_edn7", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_ednref1", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_ednref2", "http://issuu.com/jeremyhilton/docs/tricare_statement_for_the_record_21_june_2012?mode=window&backgroundColor=%23222222", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_ednref3", "http://www.opm.gov/carrier/carrier_letters/2012/2012-12a2.pdf", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_ednref4", "http://issuu.com/jeremyhilton/docs/aap_statement_for_the_record_21_june_2012_hearing?mode=window&backgroundColor=%23222222", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_ednref5", "http://www.autismvotes.org/atf/cf/%7B2A179B73-96E2-44C3-8816-1B1C0BE5334B%7D/DoD.GeriDawson_SASC.6.21.2012.pdf", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_ednref6", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php#_ednref7", "http://www.publicconsultinggroup.com/educationlaw/file.axd?file=2012%2f4%2fFL+Ruling+Autism+Medical+Necessity+2012+Mar.mht"], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2012/07/06/senate-hearing/", "title": "Senate Hearing on Medical Necessity of\u00a0ABA"},

You have to call Stuart and find out what just happened! I think we did it, Honey! I THINK WE DID IT!!!\u201d\u00a0 She was just as stunned as I was and told me she would call Stuart Spielman of Autism Speaks Government Relations immediately and find out what was going on.\u00a0 Stuart had been working tirelessly for the last year to make this dream come true.In the meantime, I was just shaking violently in my living room desperate to know wtf just happened.\u00a0 Literally, rocking back and forth.The phone rings.\u00a0 It\u2019s a DC number.\u00a0 OH. MY. GOD.\u00a0 Here it comes.Congressman Larson: \u201cRachel.\u00a0 Rachel.\u00a0 We did it.\u201dI won\u2019t go into further detail of how I was simultaneously sobbing, hyperventilating and screaming on the phone with my United States Congressman.\u00a0 I am sure you can imagine.He managed to continue to speak above my gasping for air to tell me that it came down to Representative Tom Rooney walking across the hall to speak to Chairman McKeon.\u00a0 \u201cSir, this is personal.\u201d\u00a0 Rooney had related his own experience with a military family with a child on the spectrum.And that, my friends, is the best example of how much it matters when we speak up.So many dozens of stars did indeed align over the last two years.\u00a0 Too many to recount here in this one post, just as there are too many people on this earth who played a role in moving those stars into place.We still have work to do.\u00a0 We must go through the motions of securing this amendment through the Senate when they vote on the NDAA.\u00a0 But I am confident we have covered all the bases and I am assured we can make that happen.It will take a few years to implement these changes to TRICARE once we have finished this legislative process.\u00a0 But it will happen.\u00a0 It is a huge leap forward for all children with disabilities.\u00a0 It literally paves the way for bigger and better things in the care of our kids.\u00a0 Our work is not done, but we can all be so proud today.\u201cThank you\u201d will never be enough, and I cannot possibly list every individual I must thank in one post, but for beginners:Thank you to Karen Driscoll, Marine Corps wife, mother of three, and my mentor.Thank you to the many more military parents who have been in this battle long before I came on the scene.\u00a0 Never giving up.Thank you to Jeremy Hilton, Military Spouse of the Year, for his dedication to helping all military families with special needs.Thank you to my dear fellow military spouse, Jeneil, and her faith and family.\u00a0 Mahi, you inspire me to continue to always believe He is near.Thank you to Jess at Diary of a Mom.\u00a0 My friend, my inspiration to keep moving forward.Thank you to Bob and Suzanne Wright of Autism Speaks.\u00a0 It could not have come together without your support and your efforts to enlighten the world.Thank you to the entire team at Autism Speaks and Autism Votes\u00a0\u2013 namely Stuart, Rick, Ali, Judith,\u00a0Nora, Mark, Dana and dozens more.\u00a0 You all came together and learned a new piece of the puzzle and ran with it to make the world a better place.Thank you to Congressman John Larson and his staff \u2013 namely Dave and Eva.\u00a0 I love you for your service to The People.Thank you to Representative Tom Rooney for speaking up.Thank you to Chairman McKeon for doing the right thing.Thank you to Mike Strautmanis and Brad Cooper for listening.\u00a0 I\u2019m still waiting to hear about those tiny doors, Mike. Thank you to my family at AMFAS and Nicholas who continued to encourage me.Thank you to my friends and family and my blogging sisters and brothers.\u00a0 You rocked it out, people.\u00a0 You ROCKED. IT. OUT.Thank you to everyone I spammed with blog posts, petitions, emails, tweets, and general pleas for help.\u00a0 You are all heroes. You are all ROCK STARS.Thank you to Shannon.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to, but you didn\u2019t give a crap about what I wanted ;0)Cheers.[Ed note: Oh yeah, we really are not done yet \u2013 keep signing and sharing the petition at Change.org \u2013 we must secure the Senate version of the CMKAA amendment to NDAA!

STARS.You know who I am referring to here\u00a0\u2013 the likes of Mick Jagger, Steven Tyler, Jon Bon Jovi and Bono \u2013 guys that have been consistently rocking it out for millions of fans for decades and never disappoint.\u00a0 They are a rare breed of superstar that have escaped the need for radical reinvention of themselves \u2013 only an updated haircut seems to have been required for this bunch of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Rollers.\u00a0 They just keep putting themselves out there and making magic.\u00a0 Every time.I have some experience in the entertainment industry.\u00a0 I have seen a lot of what goes on backstage and I have to tell you these new reality shows looking to find the next big star are using the wrong criteria.\u00a0 Sure, they may showcase some extremely talented folks but the chances of finding that singularly incredible Rock Star are slim to none.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because the true definition of a Rock Star not only includes talent, but growth from within that moves that person to share their song with the world \u2013 not in vain, but with fervor to make a difference in this world.I need to let you all in on a secret I have been keeping for years now \u2013 I just cannot contain it any longer.I gave birth to a Rock Star nearly eight years ago.It was pretty clear from the start that there was something really special about this child.\u00a0 He had some innate ability to insert himself into people\u2019s hearts.\u00a0 He smiled early \u2013 no, it wasn\u2019t gas, I assure you\u00a0\u2013 he just connected in a way few babies do.\u00a0 There was pure joy aglow in his eyes.\u00a0 As a toddler, his giggles would travel through every person in the room with a contagiousness\u00a0I simply had never seen before.\u00a0 The Boy was an easy-peasy baby.\u00a0 He slept through the night at seven-weeks-old and would refuel with 15-ounce bottles of formula\u00a0using speed and precision that rivals NASCAR pit crews.\u00a0 At the age of three, The Boy was still napping twice a day and growing so fast I could hardly keep him clothed.\u00a0 I barely saw this child for the first four years as he slept nearly 18 of the 24 hours in a day.And he was always HAPPY.In 2006, his baby sister arrived.\u00a0 The Boy was barely three when RM came home.\u00a0\u00a0RM\u2019s first year is a book in itself, so someday I will reopen the old wounds and share \u2013 but today is about The Boy.\u00a0 From the very beginning of RM \u2013 the hospital, surgeries, tubes, endless doctors, piles of medications and the huge markerboard that filled our hallway listing the what/how/when of caring for RM \u2013 through it all my Boy was a Rock Star in the making.\u00a0The Boy hasn\u2019t been many places.\u00a0 Early on, RM\u2019s health kept us away from public playscapes, parks and restaurants.\u00a0 We stayed home all the time.\u00a0 We made the best of it.\u00a0 For much of the time SGM was deployed and I was simply trying to keep us ALIVE \u2013 a trip to Chuck E. Cheese was NOT happening.\u00a0 If we had a box of mac\u2019n\u2019cheese left in the cupboard we were doing good.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t have respite care for myself or for The Boy so while I spent 24/7 caring for RM and her feeding tube and changing her out of puke every time I turned around \u2013 there just wasn\u2019t much left but love.\u00a0Love.That\u2019s it.\u00a0 Snuggles at night when I pulled him into bed with me, just the two of us in the quiet.\u00a0 A mother wrapping her love tightly around her baby boy.\u00a0 A kiss and an \u2018I love you, SnuggleBear\u2019 every time I passed by him, sometimes a dozen an hour.\u00a0 That\u2019s all I had left to give.It was enough for my Rock Star.He was STILL A HAPPY KID.\u00a0 His beaming smile captivated people\u2019s attention.\u00a0 He grew fiercely protective of his baby sister AND his Mama.\u00a0 He helped with any little thing he could.\u00a0 He never complained that we didn\u2019t go places and he never asked for more than he knew I could give at any time.\u00a0 He cherished what I had to offer and in kind, he offered all he had to RM.\u00a0 He would read to her and let her play near him while touching all of his stuff.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t seem to mind that she would chew all of the tires off of his prized matchbox cars.\u00a0 Instead, he would cheer her on with every new accomplishment.\u00a0 He would spend hours teaching her \u2013 patiently.\u00a0 The Boy single-handedly taught his baby sister how to count to Ten.\u00a0 He would sing to her \u2013 Dear God \u2013 he would sing so sweetly to her.This Boy of mine \u2013 this amazing creation sent to me was SAVING ME.\u00a0 His song was lifting me up and his love was speaking to me.\u00a0 My Rock Star was showing me the way.Now about to turn eight, he continues to be the most loving big brother to RM who is turning five.\u00a0 He has overcome many of his own sensory processing issues.\u00a0 But something even more spectacular is happening.\u00a0 The Boy is becoming increasingly more sure of himself and his place in this world \u2013 at the ripe old age of eight.\u00a0 He is expressing thoughts outside of his role in this house and having FUN finding his own interests.\u00a0 He is stepping out of his shell and engaging in a life that more resembles what it should be \u2013 giggles, being a goofball, running with \u2018the guys\u2019 and having his first crush on a cutie down the street from us.\u00a0So where\u2019s that next new, magical Rock Star?Right here.He\u2019s putting himself out there and making magic.\u00a0 And he\u2019s updated his hair to prove it.The Boy, June 2011\nhttps://stimcity.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/08-i-love-rock-n-roll.mp3[I Love Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll by Joan Jett]", "outgoing_links": ["https://stimcity.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/08-i-love-rock-n-roll.mp3"], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2011/06/21/rock-star/", "title": "Rock Star"},

If this is the case, we are failing not only our children, but ourselves.\u00a0 These children are our future \u2013 no matter how disabled.\u00a0 These children will grow up and become the Department of Education, Police Officers, Firefighters, and Accountants of our retirement accounts.\u00a0 I am thinking again, that we should do our best to help them in any way possible.\u201cDepartment of Education\u201d\u2026 This makes me think that \u201ceducated\u201d people work there.\u00a0 And being such an important department with what I can only imagine is a very large salary budget (above the 600K maybe?) I would assume that [StimCity] would hire qualified personnel.\u00a0 So, I am going to go out on a limb here and assume that all the people included in this email are educated and are qualified.So this leads me to my question\u2026 Why am I having to write this letter from AFGHANISTAN\u00a0to find out why a Town Worker that I assist in paying the salary for can\u2019t seem to pull it together and communicate with families in a nice, civilized way?\u00a0 Why are grown adults having to resort to email and lawyers to discuss the programs that children in a town as large and prosperous as [StimCity] are entitled to?COMMUNICATION.Somewhere along the line, we have a communication failure. \u00a0In my line of work this is quickly identified as \u2018the dead pile up on the battlefield\u2019. \u00a0In this instance, the \u2018dead\u2019 would be the children and parents that have come to a dead-end with a department established to HELP find them solutions to their issues.\u00a0 We are failing.Many people, who have little inside knowledge of how the military works except for what they see on television, do not understand the real way we communicate in the Army. \u00a0I very seldom bark orders, yell, nor do I ever belittle, degrade, chastise or berate soldiers in daily duties or on the battlefield.\u00a0 I give CLEAR orders and GUIDANCE in a voice that establishes trust and understanding.\u00a0 I lead by example, and in return earn my soldiers\u2019 undying trust, devotion and RESPECT.\u00a0 They will follow me anywhere as long as I COMMUNICATE to them what we are doing and why.We call this \u2018Task and Purpose\u2019.With that, we accomplish amazing things.So, [Special Education Director and Staff], what is YOUR TASK AND PURPOSE?If you cannot answer this question without looking at your job description then you are wrong.\u00a0 If you did look at your job description, you will not find the words \u2018compassion\u2019, \u2018understanding\u2019, \u2018helpful\u2019 and \u2018committed to what is right\u2019 \u2013 Reason: they are expected of everyone regardless of what we do for a living.To help in this process I will be more than happy to sit and communicate with each and every one of you. \u00a0I will be home shortly for 2 weeks, and in a few months I will return for a longer stay.\u00a0 I will be available morning, noon and night to discuss my daughter and her education, the Department of Education and even some of my experiences in better communication.I welcome an open dialogue that will promote a FRIENDLY PROBLEM-SOLVING environment between parents and [StimCity Personnel].\u00a0 Because if we fail this cause \u2013 at some point \u2013 enough people like [us parents] will get together, pool resources and communicate together to form a plan that removes roadblocks to success.I look forward to working with all of you to come to an agreeable solution to what is really a very simple problem to fix.Respectfully,SGM", "outgoing_links": ["https://stimcity.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/battleagainstautism/", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/military-life/"], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2011/06/19/daddy-is-a-soldie/", "title": "My Daddy is a\u00a0Soldier"},

I thought it fitting tonight for Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. Enjoy!]\u00a0\u00a0Some of my fellow Mama Warriors are in need of positive vibes today\u2026 I think RM can stack the pads on this one and make a save in the face of autism\u2026\u2026because hockey is not only good, in some locales it is spelled H-O-P-E.~~~~New Englanders have a long tradition of rooting for underdogs\u2026 and standing behind our teams for decades with nothing to show for it but hope and fervor that SOMEDAY a Pennant win will lead to a World Series sweep, or a Playoff rumble result in the beloved Whalers hoisting a Stanley Cup in victory.Oh, dear New Englanders\u2026 Ye of so much FAITH and HOPE\u2026As we speak, the most diehard of Red Sox fans are gearing up for a spring-training preemptive slaughter of the Yankees tonight in Fort Meyers, Florida. Because the Red Sox have a tradition of starting out in early spring with fury\u2026 and often, over the years, losing their steam toward the end of the summer\u2026 and simply disappearing among the pack come autumn\u2026 you might have given up on the Sox a long time ago\u2026Let me tell you\u2026 you cannot go to a mall -or let\u2019s say, a bar \u2013 in New England without spotting a Red Sox Fan. The same could be said (perhaps only slightly smaller of scale) about a Whalers Fan\u2026 and that team doesn\u2019t even live here anymore.For those of you not familiar, Hartford was once home to the NHL Whalers Hockey Team. I won\u2019t go into detail, but many a death-threat were muttered angrily when the team was bought in the late \u201890s and essentially stripped of its hometown fans, colors, and Brass Bonanza\u2026 and quietly shipped off to North Carolina. We were left with an AHL team\u2026 formerly the Wolfpack, now the CT Whale.April is Autism Awareness Month, the Month of the Military Child, and the Month of Renewed Hope for all Red Sox fans\u2026So what about hockey? Diehard Whalers fans that still linger among the New England populace enjoyed a resurgence of Whalermania this season with the Hartford Wolfpack\u2019s makeover in homage to \u201cThe Whale\u201d. It has been a renewal of HOPE for hockey fans in Connecticut\u2026 maybe this April we should include a \u201cConnecticut Hockey Fans for HOPE\u201d campaign to keep the interest alive\u2026We went to a CT Whale game on Saturday. ALL of us.We sort of committed to a night of hockey dedicated to RM. Meaning\u2026 even if we didn\u2019t make it through the doors, it was ok (see my Church post). Mom, Dad, and big brother had already had our hockey games this season that we enjoyed. This was RM\u2019s chance.Maybe she would make it through the noisy parking garage with florescent lighting and odoriffic assaults like urine and stale beer. Perhaps she would survive waiting in the Will Call line to get our tickets. Either way, we had a tiny amount of HOPE, and that was enough to set out on such an adventure in honor of RM.Not only did RM walk into the arena filled with noise, lights, and crowds of people \u2013 without a fuss and without headphones \u2013 SHE. LOVED. IT.This kid went NUTS. GOOD nuts. I mean, REALLY\u2026 never before had my husband and I seen anything like it. RM was enthralled with the \u201cskating\u201d\u2026Oh, crap \u2013 what is the damned sign for \u2018ice skating\u2019? or \u2018hockey\u2019? Screw it\u2026 we\u2019ll improvise with \u2018roller-skating\u2019\u2026 My baby girl signed \u2018skating\u2019 with enthusiasm parallel to having ice cream for breakfast. This was BIG. HUGE. WOW.Ok\u2026 this can\u2019t last (SGM and I looked at each other)\u2026 it just can\u2019t be\u2026 She is clapping wildly to the music, bouncing so joyously in her seat that she is CATCHING AIR, People\u2026 I look at the Sergeant Major again, beaming, and I say, \u201cI am completely HIGH right now. Like\u2026 on CRACK, I\u2019m so high. Can this really be???\u201d\u201cYep! Hockey is GOOD!\u201d he says\u2026 beaming just as brightly. RM quickly repeats, \u201cOCK-ee GOO-ud!\u201d She is shaking, she is having such a great time.Suddenly, the horn blasted the end of the 3rd period.CT Whale \u2013 4, Sharks \u2013 2\u2026 it was over.Our children \u2013 \u2018CHILDREN\u2019 as in PLURAL \u2013 had enjoyed an event with BOTH Mom and Dad\u2026 and popcorn, and soda, and laughter, and fist-pumping. LOTS of fist-pumping.MORE! I want MORE of THIS!But April is coming\u2026 Whale and Whalers fans will soon hang up their throwback jerseys\u2026 and life will resume\u2026\u2026except in THIS house where HOPE has made a late-season comeback, thrown a stick-check on autism and said, \u201cNot today. Not this time.\u201dThe Stanley Cup\u2019s got nothing on what WE won this past weekend. We won HOPE back for our family\u2019s future.It was a Gordie Howe Hat Trick. SGM and I scored for our entire family \u2013 and kicked a little Autism Ass while we were at it.Hockey IS good.So is HOPE.Boston Red Sox\u2026 here we come!\u00a0", "outgoing_links": ["https://stimcity.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/brass-bonanza11.mp3", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_Whalers", "http://www.ctwhale.com/", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/church/"], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2011/06/15/hockey-is-still-good/", "title": "Stanley Cup Finals \u2013 Hockey is Still\u00a0Good"},

yesterday.\u00a0 SGM had decided to take the day off and help me move some rocks in the backyard.\u00a0 One of the many hidden treasures in this otherwise old and battered little ranch \u2013 a ridiculous amount of beautiful field stones, large and small, that we hadn\u2019t noticed when we first came to look at the house.\u00a0 Over the last nine years since, I had constructed a small rock wall that flowed along the front and side of the house containing a garden that I had long dreamed of growing.\u00a0 Many late summer evenings spent tending to young blooms those first few years.\u00a0 I was so very proud of all I had created \u2013 all I had poured my heart and soul into.But hard times had come.Prolific weeds had crept in and overtaken nearly every inch of breathing room between each of my precious budding flowers.\u00a0 There just wasn\u2019t any time or energy left at the end of the day to fight back.\u00a0 I might grab hold of a single leafy weed or two as I passed by, barely noting the blooms being choked all around.\u00a0 It was too painful to look more closely and recognize all that had been forgotten and neglected.\u00a0 I was tired.\u00a0 So tired.Two Afghanistan deployments, 4q deletion, autism and family drama had choked the life out of my garden \u2013 out of me.\u00a0 Out of motherhood, marriage and church, too.\u00a0 There were days I felt hollowed and left to compost.\nhttps://stimcity.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/01-dog-days-are-over.mp3Those Dog Days Are Over now.\u00a0 I have spent the last few months rebuilding, renewing.\u00a0 Everything.\u00a0 It started with a pile of rocks that I purchased three springs ago.\u00a0 Dumped at the end of our driveway, it took me more than two years to place the gravel in the garden beds one barrow-load at a time.\u00a0 Exhausting but rewarding work, it just took so much for me to find the energy among the chaos to get it done.\u00a0 But this summer was different.\u00a0 I was relearning what peace felt like.\u00a0 Rebuilding, renewing.\u00a0 Breathing.\u00a0 Relearning love, patience and quiet moments with my babies.\u00a0 Revisiting the love with my husband \u2013 what it felt like before and what made it new again.Those weeds didn\u2019t know what hit them.The fury of which I ripped out the old and dying and replaced with new and exciting was dizzying.\u00a0 But oh, how it felt so good.\u00a0 Long summer days spent digging in the earth after countless hours wandering the local nurseries until I found just what I wanted to grow.\u00a0 What I wanted to grow.It was an amazing summer.\u00a0 In so many ways.The spaces between each of my precious buds are opened up once more, free breathing room to blossom.\u00a0 Space for roots to be nourished, leaves to grow lush and for petals to welcome the sun.\u00a0 As it should be.Space in between my babies and me that can now be filled with sweet kisses and a thousand \u2018I love you\u2019s.\u00a0 I feel the love for my children more fiercely and softly than ever before.\u00a0 It hits me continuously like a freight train of feathers.\u00a0 Like the moment they came into this world, there is nothing else like it \u2013 every moment, every day.\u00a0 I can feel my heart once again booming, swelling, aching for them.\u00a0 As it should be.Now lies space to be Me again.\u00a0 To be filled with time for reflection, personal pursuits and renewed confidence.\u00a0 To feel passion again for the sun on my face and the earth in my hands.\u00a0 I can breathe easy as I sway in the breeze with eyes closed and just daydream once again.No more weeds.\u00a0 No more chaos.\u00a0 No more war.All of which leaves me feverishly in love with the SGM.\u00a0 It\u2019s a new love.\u00a0 It\u2019s solid.\u00a0 It\u2019s hot.\u00a0 It\u2019s tingly and it fills me.\u00a0 More than just a tag-team that survived the last five years, we are in love.\u00a0 Madly.Now that the gardens were tended to and made beautiful again, it was time to move forward.\u00a0 I was ready to build upon what I have and make it new again.\u00a0 I had always wanted to take the larger field stones and construct a fire pit.\u00a0 I dreamed of a relaxing space for us.\u00a0 Snuggling by a fire after a long autumn day of crunching leaves beneath giggly children\u2019s feet.So there we were, out in the yard working together to care for all we have built together over the years.\u00a0 Appreciating the old, moving on from the tired, and constructing what remains.\u00a0 Reconstructing from a solid foundation with an eye towards the future.\u00a0 A joyful future to be lived in each moment and savored like a fine wine.Our\u00a0new fire pit made of old stones is perfect.\u00a0 Last night after the children were tucked away, tuckered from a day spent in the yard and dinner served at the picnic table, SGM and I enjoyed the new Ranger TV.\u00a0 And I told him \u2013 there was nothing I could want for.\u00a0 I am so happy.Thank you, My Love, for all of your hard work out in the yard with me this summer.\u00a0 Thank you for the strength and love you share.\u00a0 Thank you for each stone you labored over to reconstruct with me.\u00a0 What we have built and continue to grow is beyond blessed.", "outgoing_links": ["https://stimcity.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/01-dog-days-are-over.mp3"], "link":

{"date": "July 14, 2011", "body": "Listen.\u00a0 Autism involves a lot of urinary incontinence, poop-flinging and sometimes it\u2019s just plain old messy.I know this will sound crazy but\u00a0I was blessed by a puddle of pee yesterday and I am praying you will read this and receive the good juju from it as well.RM has been potty-training at school for the last month or so and has found a great deal of success. \u00a0However, toileting is a long process for many of our kids with autism so RM wears underwear during the\u00a0school day\u00a0but\u00a0wears a pull-up\u00a0to prevent accidents while she is riding the van back and forth.The other day RM came home from school completely soaked.\u00a0 She\u00a0had left school\u00a0in underwear instead of a pull-up.\u00a0 A minor oversight.\u00a0 Nothing to freak out over.I sent a text message to the van monitor and asked her to check the car seat to see if it was wet.\u00a0 It was.\u00a0 The van came back by and I grabbed the car seat out of the back so that I could wash the cover before school\u00a0the next morning.By the time\u00a0the van pulled away\u00a0again I was shaking.\u00a0 I had turned the seat over to take off the cover and on the label\u00a0found the manufacture date \u2013 1998!\u00a0 My child had been riding in a car seat that was several years past expiration.\u00a0 Did you know car seats expire?\u00a0\u00a0 AND I learned that\u00a0my daughter was\u00a0TEN pounds and\u00a0FOUR inches over its limit.\u00a0 I. WAS. PISSED.I called the transportation company and spoke\u00a0to \u201cCandy\u201d, the manager. \u00a0I had\u00a0previously spoken\u00a0to her\u00a0about\u00a0a proper child safety seat for RM way back in April, a week before she started at her current school.\u00a0 I had given this woman RM\u2019s height and weight and advised her that RM needed a 5-point-harness seat rated for up to at least 65 pounds.\u00a0 She said, \u2018Absolutely\u2019.Pay close attention to what I am about to admit to, because I pray no one else falls into this trap themselves.From the first day the van arrived to take my child to school, more than 15 miles away through three towns and over two major highways, I had my doubts that the seat RM was riding in was the right one for her.\u00a0 But I said nothing to the company about the seat she was given because I wanted to start off on a good foot and build a peaceful relationship with the folks transporting my baby every day.\u00a0 DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.Any persons responsible for transporting your child to and from school MUST follow all child safety seat regulations.\u00a0 The seat must be the proper type, size and rated specifically to meet the weight and height of your child.\u00a0 If your child is over 40 pounds and 40 inches tall \u2013 they MUST be provided a larger convertible seat (most this size can be used with a 5-point harness up to weights of 65-80 pounds\u00a0or as a belt-positioning booster up to 100 pounds).\u00a0 EVERY SEAT has a label usually underneath or along the side that lists the date of manufacture, the expiration date (usually about 6 years) and the weight and height limits.\u00a0 All seats and vehicles being used to transport students should be equipped with the LATCH system.PLEASE!\u00a0 Check your child\u2019s seating on school transportation and ALWAYS remain aware of the child safety seats you use in your own vehicles.\u00a0 Does your child still meet the weight and height requirements?\u00a0 Is your seat installed properly?\u00a0 Are you securing the buckles and chest straps in the correct position?If you are unsure of the child safety seat being used for your child, contact your local police department.\u00a0 Most departments have at least one member dedicated to performing child safety seat inspections and you can request a free inspection not only for your personal vehicle, but for your child\u2019s school transportation as well.Do not take for granted that your child is being properly secured in an appropriate child safety seat.I am so grateful for that puddle of pee.Cheers,Rachel[Ed note: I failed to mention that after I ripped \u201cCandy\u201d a new one, I nearly choked when she spoke of her intent to \u2018dispose of the seat when it is returned\u2019. \u00a0NO WAY, LADY.\u00a0 We threw that 13-year-old piece of crap seat in the garbage ourselves.\u00a0 I shudder to think of the child it would have been used with next.\u00a0 No way.]", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.schoolbusland.com/blue/images/k35278_1.jpg"], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2011/07/14/shorted/", "title": "Shorted on the Short\u00a0Bus"},

You will have to deploy again \u2013 go through hell \u2013 again.I\u2019m sorry, My Love.\u00a0On the topic of our healthcare crisis in this country, there are so many arguments to be heard. So much talk about the costs; the political drama of partisan strategies and taxes, who should pay what and how should that money be spent.When I think of the healthcare crisis in this country, so many faces come to mind.I see the troubled face of a retired nurse of more than 50 years service in the healthcare industry. I have listened as she shared her experience in a rehab home recovering from a broken leg. \u201cNursing isn\u2019t what it used to be.\u201dI see the tear-soaked face of a mother who has sat in a clinic waiting room for more than 2 hours with her screaming infant. With no place else to go, she prays her name is called before she has to leave because she cannot miss another shift at work.I see the embarrassment on the leathery face of a day-laborer asking the pharmacist for just a few pills of his monthly medication, because that is all he can afford.I see my daughter\u2019s chubby-cheeked smile. I am terrified. Do you see their faces?Do you see your own? Or that of your child? And there are so many more to see. \u00a0Folks who have beaten cancer, and those who have not.\u00a0 The unemployed \u2018wealthy\u2019 who find themselves homeless because cancer was the last thing they could afford.\u00a0 The working poor in this country that are served eviction notices because a week of the flu cost them so much more than a bottle of aspirin.I also see the face of a brave and selfless soldier. Whether the face of a Wounded Warrior who cannot get the care he or she requires and deserves, or a father of two who has served his country for 25 years and cannot secure his own family\u2019s future healthcare.\u00a0 It IS a crisis.1 in 88 active duty military dependent children live with autism.Only 10% of those children are receiving the autism therapies and care they require.10%. Though not an easy task, all active duty dependents are eligible to apply for autism benefits through the military\u2019s TRICARE insurance and ECHO program, and therefore could theoretically obtain it. The access is sketchy at best for many of these families. With changes of duty station, cycling deployments, and inconsistent providers, even the most diligent parents fail to get what their child with autism so desperately needs.Now hear this \u2013 the moment the child\u2019s soldier retires \u2013 that\u2019s it. Done.No more ECHO. No more autism coverage.Retirees \u2013 WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY FOR 20 YEARS \u2013 are not eligible to access the autism therapies that TRICARE provides active duty dependents.My husband is 43.Our daughter is 4.We are ONE YEAR into her autism diagnosis. My brave and mighty soldier is burdened with the weight of knowing that he must choose insurance coverage his baby girl needs over retirement he so richly deserves.25 years of service.3 wars.Countless medals and citations.It isn\u2019t just autism, either.The ECHO special needs coverage program is what we have relied on so many times throughout RM\u2019s first years with 4q deletion syndrome. It covers durable medical equipment, respite care, supplies, formulas, and home nursing care.THE MOMENT A SOLDIER WITH A SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD RETIRES \u2013 ALL OF THE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS ARE GONE.Let\u2019s do some math and then I\u2019ll let you go.Most career, active duty military members joined when they were just babies themselves, between 18 and 21 years old. Let\u2019s say a soldier joins at 18 and has a child when he is 25. That child is diagnosed with autism at 3 years old when the soldier is 28. The soldier is eligible (and often forced) to retire at 38, when his child is 13. That\u2019s it. No more autism coverage.Did I mention that this soldier retired at the rank of an E-6 Staff Sergeant and earns a retirement check of just $1,815. per month before taxes???\u00a0\u2666I love you, Honey.

{"date": "October 27, 2014", "body": "It\u2019s hard to believe this breakthrough in evolution has been happening right under our noses and yet we just didn\u2019t recognize the gravity and awesomeness of what is really taking place at this critical time in human history. We, the autism community, have been fighting and bullying each other over this label and that, over causes and cures. Folks are terrified of the \u201ctsunami of autism\u201d coming due to the exponential rise in prevalence. But all of that mess is meaningless because autism is the cure.What?!  you say? Oh, yes. Let\u2019s explore this phenomenon of human evolution together. And let me preempt the expected onslaught of commenters who think I am crazy because some autistics are not possibly capable of being evolutionary supreme beings \u2013 mountains of science has already proven that an average of 90% of human communication is nonverbal.\u00a0 If you think that autistics who don\u2019t speak are not valid entities in our progress through evolution, you should brush up on your own 90% and recognize that autistics are overachievers in this category who we could learn a crapton from.First, what is autism? Not the clinical definition, but what autistics actually experience in daily life.\u00a0 Anyone?Well, it\u2019s great in a lot of ways when we don\u2019t have to bend, twist, cajole, script, or freak out to try to fit into the neurotypical world. It\u2019s great when we can be ourselves and find others like us who get it.\u00a0 It\u2019s even better when the lights aren\u2019t too bright, the wind isn\u2019t too harsh, the noises aren\u2019t too loud, the subway isn\u2019t too crowded, clothes don\u2019t feel too tight or too loose or have scratchy tags, and so awesome when we know we can retreat to our safe space if the world around us gets to be too much. We\u2019re usually great at finding what works for us and we do a great job of carving out alone time to regroup and really reflect on our lives. It will be nicer to be more accepted and understood in coming decades (I hope) and of course the increase in prevalence will mean we can feel less alone in our awesomeness. One of the advantages about being autistic is that we can be super focused on getting something really important done.\u00a0 We don\u2019t get distracted by bullshit.So what sucks about autism? The bullshit. You see the bullshit of the neurotypical world is what slows everything down. Not just for us, but clearly for everyone. For us it slows down our processing time trying to figure out who is sincere and who is full of shit. We have that thing called \u201cmind-blindness\u201d which means we have a really hard time reading other\u2019s intentions (A.K.A. bullshit). For everyone in general, how satisfied are we with our government? See any bullshit happening there? What about everyday social interactions? Drama? Gossip? Autism just doesn\u2019t compute that shit. We seriously just don\u2019t get it. If there is a task, it needs to be completed. If a friend is in need, you help them and tell them you love them. These are concrete, easy rules to live by \u2013 a piece of cake for autistics! But in the neurotypical world, there are \u201crules\u201d for things that cause people to act in ways we will simply never understand like \u201cwaiting periods\u201d to call someone after a date. For me, I have had issues with being seen as arrogant because I didn\u2019t know that I wasn\u2019t supposed to share my knowledge about something when someone was asking about it. See? Isn\u2019t that sentence itself confusing?If we look back throughout the history of humans, we can draw from it the most simple of virtues by looking at the first tribal societies. Built around family, honor, respect, and responsibility, men and women attracted to each other coupled up, made babies, committed to their children, extended family and village. They worked hard. They had beautiful threads of community strung between every member of their villages through common goals, music, storytelling, and craft. They were happy\u00a0having nearly\u00a0nothing but each other.Take that early, loving essence of man, combine it with the modern intellect and technology we have right this very moment and tell me that an autistic individual isn\u2019t the product of those two most incredible evolutionary movements.Our autistics today and to come will possess the most advanced technological tools for slingshotting us humans beyond the bullshit and into a future filled with advanced medicine, environmental responsibility, workplace proficiency, and more fun than the kid inside you can possibly imagine. (Think of flying cars and Star Wars Episode XX!)

Even if\u00a0one more child with autism received the treatment he or she needs while we figure this mess out?\u00a0 Well, that would be tragic.\u00a0 And I think promoting career advancement in the field of BCBAs is a stupid idea, too.\u00a0 I\u2019m with you, DoD.Next, apparently due to a lack of mobile diagnostic capability, the military kids who have autism are too spread out to find them all.\u00a0 So why start the search?\u00a0 We might actually find them.\u00a0 If we find them, we may have to treat them.

{"date": "June 20, 2013", "body": "Why My Seven-year-old Autistic Daughter\u2019s Best Friends Are All Over 35Today should be a joyous day for us here. There should be balloons and presents and cake and donkey rides or something.\u00a0 But instead, it will be a quiet snoop and poop mission (real infantry term, you can look it up).\u00a0 SGM and I will slide into the school for graduation and slide out, likely with me retreating into the fetal position in the bed of the truck as he takes us down the highway toward home at 80 miles per hour so that the sensory thrills of the ride numb me into a coma.Let me explain.It has now been a little over two years since RM began attending her outplacement autism school.\u00a0 The one that took me fourteen months to get her into.\u00a0 They have an amazing typical peer preschool on site, NAEYC-accredited, with staff that is fluent in sign language, art, music, and love.\u00a0 The peers are ages three to five and are hand-picked to be excellent models for autistic friends.\u00a0 In this setting where RM has spent about one-third of her time over the last two years, she has learned critical basic pre-educational skills such as turn-taking, group games, learning to sit for circle time with weather and calendar, following simple group activities, learning about friends and social themes like birthdays, holidays, and family.Her time there has been priceless.And filled with joy.So today is a bitter pill to swallow.\u00a0 My baby loves her friends in preschool.\u00a0 But she is now monstrously larger than they are, and as she is turning seven in a few weeks, one cannot argue that the time to move on has come.\u00a0 I accept that.\u00a0 The school has been fabulous about slowly weaning her time out of the preschool over the last few months, so that it shouldn\u2019t be a recognizable trauma for anyone other than me.So here we are.\u00a0 As she rode off on her van this morning the chest pains came and the crocodile tears and SGM telling me this is all ok, this is her path right now.\u00a0 And sure, I agree.\u00a0 And I didn\u2019t even punch him.\u00a0 He\u2019s right. And I continue to cling to the God\u2019s honest belief that truly, RM\u2019s very best friends are not the children at the school anyways.\u00a0 That was never the case from the very beginning. RM is in love with her teachers.\u00a0 The DOZENS of adults who love her and care for her and teach her and joke with her and smile with her and talk with her and listen to her every single time she has something to say.She thrives at this place because it is the grownups that hear her and understand her.\u00a0 Not the typical peers, nor her classmates.\u00a0 She loves this place because she is challenged there, not by communication boundaries, but by academics.\u00a0 She loves this place because she knows well enough that these grownups are going to teach her the correct social cues every time.\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t have to decipher the behaviors of the typical peers there anymore.\u00a0 And for now, just for now, I am ok with that. I have to be.Here at home RM has her nine-year-old brother who adores her as her best friend.\u00a0 They belly-laugh and play legos and watch silly videos of themselves and belly-laugh some more.\u00a0 They are madly in love with each other.\u00a0 If school doesn\u2019t have the \u201cage-appropriate\u201d peers, well I have the best one at home anyways.Meanwhile, trust that I aim to correct this situation at the outplacement. \u00a0There are far too many brilliant options to be considered.\u00a0 There are ways we haven\u2019t yet found\u00a0to give our kids access to social time with typical peer models, so let\u2019s find them.Even the \u201cbest\u201d can always be \u201cbetter\u201d.My hope and dream for all parents is that you truly, deep within your heart believe that those scary sounding letters \u201cI.E.P.\u201d can\u00a0start to look less daunting.\u00a0 I want you to believe that you have the right, and the power, to build a program that has never been built before.\u00a0 You can build it\u00a0for\u00a0your child.There is no such thing as, \u201cWe don\u2019t do that.\u201dCheers,Rachel", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2013/06/20/graduating-preschool/", "title": "Graduating Typical Peer\u00a0Preschool"},

What would happen when all of us showed up at the pool with our vests and inflatable wings? Would we all be tossed to the curb?Can you imagine?Can you imagine, Ellington Ridge?Excluded Flotation Vest and the Handsome Child Who Wears ItUPDATE: Friday, June 28, 2013 6:50am \u2013 Local media reached out to the ERCC yesterday afternoon for comment.\u00a0 Management quickly asserted that Mrs. Millen never filled out the application, so therefore the club was unable to review her family\u2019s request.\u00a0 However, in WFSB\u2019s on air coverage last evening, management admitted that Mrs. Millen was not given an application during the miscommunication throughout the week but that ERCC would happily accept the family\u2019s application with waiver for the vest.\u00a0 In an email communication from management to Mrs. Millen last evening the same offer was made but included a timeline in which the Millen Family was advised it would take until mid-July before their application with waiver to accommodate their son\u2019s need for a Coast Guard approved flotation vest could be approved by the Board of Directors of the Ellington Ridge Country Club.LINK to WFSB News Coverage > CLICK HERE.\u00a0WHAT DO YOU THINK???

and then taken some more.\u00a0 Good day?\u00a0 Bad day?\u00a0 CRAPTASTIC Day?\u00a0 It\u2019s all in the song\u2026\u2665How often do you find yourself completely enveloped in a song that seems to speak directly to you and tell of your heart in that very instance?At the same time you are experiencing the sounds of the music with your ears \u2013\u00a0your eardrums vibrating wildly \u2013 tiny hairs across your skin dance rhythmically, your senses are heightened as every neuron in your body fires in syncopation.The\u00a0arousing intro\u2026 that first verse that captures you\u2026 the chorus that makes you want to sing your heart out\u2026 the bridge that lulls you back into the theme\u2026 before bursting forth from your very core\u00a0in a declaration of every emotion that has been buried within you\u2026 slowly building and building over time\u2026 you can no longer contain it\u2026 it takes on a booming voice of its own you never thought resided inside you\u2026\u201cBaby, you\u2019re a FIREWORK!\u201d\u2665One of the very first things we noticed about RM was her response to anything musical.\u00a0 Whether it was a lullaby, a Signing Time dvd or a Sara Evans song.I have always sung to my children before they went to sleep.\u00a0 A favorite of late is \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow\u201d\u2026 at Christmastime it was \u201cSilent Night\u201d.One evening, as I was singing to my delicious babes, snuggled in tightly together and smelling sweetly of baby shampoo, I noticed something new.Or rather not new \u2013 but different.If you love a child with autism, you are likely familiar with the term \u2018hand-flapping\u2019.\u00a0 It varies from child to child. \u00a0It\u2019s a form of \u2018stimming\u2019 or self-stimulating behavior \u2013\u00a0a mechanism by which many of our kids soothe and comfort themselves, or simply burn off an excess of nervous energy.RM\u2019s hand-flapping is particularly her own.\u00a0 For several months prior to her autism diagnosis, us proud and ridiculous parents thought she was brightly finger-spelling to herself in sign language.\u00a0 Go figure.\u00a0 She \u2018flaps\u2019 in a puppeteering motion with one hand close to her face as she stares at the movements of her long fingers.Anyways\u2026 this night as I sang to her \u2013\u00a0her fingers began to move in such an orchestrated and delicate dance \u2013\u00a0ebbing and flowing back and forth with such precision,\u00a0reminiscent of John Williams leading the Boston Pops through a 4th of July rendition of the 1812 Overture.\u00a0 It struck me so hard it nearly knocked the song from my lips \u2013My child can SEE this song I am singing.\u201c\u2026Cuz, Baby, you\u2019re a FIREWORK!\u2026\u201dSynesthesia is the neurological and involuntary \u201ccrossing\u201d of one sensory or cognitive pathway with a second. \u00a0For example, a person who experiences synesthesia may hear a car horn and simultaneously feel pain, or a word written on a page may appear as each letter a different color.\u00a0I KNOW that my child has gifts.\u00a0 I\u00a0KNOW that she sees things most of us will never see.I firmly believe that not only is her interpretation of the world a magical one \u2013 it is valid.Though she may not have the words to express the song in her heart today, I know she is experiencing my love with a burst of colors that nothing can compare to.\u00a0 I know that my love for her will carry her through the times when she feels like she is drifting through the wind, hoping she could start again.I know that when her skin feels paper-thin and her bundled nerves feel like a house of cards that are caving in \u2013 my love will save her.\u00a0 Not because it is fierce and strong and unyielding to the exhaustion of a long day with autism, but because I know that she feels my love in more ways than one can imagine.She feels it tightly wrapped around her always \u2013 a booming firework exploding in light \u2013 smelling of sweet wildflowers and spring \u2013 and tasting like chocolate.\u2665\u201c\u2026Baby, you\u2019re a firework!\u2026\u00a0C\u2019mon, show \u2018em what you\u2019re

Right?The whole intensity of the situation seemed lost on me.\u00a0 I just had faith that either way this was the journey and the results were predetermined.\u00a0 No matter the outcome, we were blessed by this child for however long God lent her to us.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Because this was our everyday fire drill.The PICU was new to us also.\u00a0 We were in the Big Leagues apparently.\u00a0 But again, the concept was lost on me that this meant I was to be more frazzled somehow.\u00a0 We had already brought her through several other surgeries and procedures.\u00a0 We had already sat in the \u201cregular\u201d recovery room with her enough to be familiar with the entire rotating staff there.\u00a0 This was our everday fire drill.I remember the chest drain sticking out of her, filled with blood, pouring into a bag at the foot of the bed.\u00a0 She was still on a ventilator with wires monitoring every last thing imaginable.\u00a0 But again, for some reason this was all ok.\u00a0 We stayed with her for a little while, met the staff that would be watching over her, and we went home to our other two kids.\u00a0 This was our everday fire drill.What is so strange to me looking back now, is how overwhelmingly upset I was by comparison when RM came back to her room from her first surgery with her feeding tube.\u00a0 The shock of seeing a hole cut into your child\u2019s belly and a long, ugly tube coming out was too much for me.\u00a0 How quickly I grew to love that tube for saving her life so many times.\u00a0 This was our everday fire drill.The journey has been long, often exhausting, and has left me on medication for anxiety disorder.\u00a0 There are still so many unknowns about her future, both medically and developmentally.\u00a0 This is our everyday fire drill. \u00a0But through it all, whether I remember every detail or just a snapshot of the tougher times, my baby girl has made this life brighter, more joyous, and more hopeful.From StimCity\u2019s facebook Wednesday: \u201cTonight I witnessed my baby girl in the awe of discovery as every curious expression crossed her beautiful face \u2013 the raised eyebrows, the wide eyes, the pure joy of experiencing something new and truly being in the moment \u2013 she learned the feeling of floating in water while taking a tubby. No, not earth shattering. Just so very cool to see her making such a connection.\u201dOh, Baby, you bring me such joy.\u00a0 Our everyday fire drill suits me just fine.RM at 3yo smiling while recovering from Swine Flu.

Sponsored by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, the amendment will assure all military families, regardless of their duty status, have access to behavioral therapies, such as applied behavior analysis (ABA), under the military healthcare program TRICARE. Existing ABA benefits are limited and often fall short of minimum standards and prescribed levels of care placing an undue financial strain on many military families. Further, military members also face the loss of those benefits when they leave active duty, even as a result of being wounded in action.

I took her out into the concourse to give her a chance to regroup.\u00a0 It never happened.\u00a0I felt like one of those color-streaked leaves being lifted and slammed onto the pavement \u2013 over and over again.\u00a0 I can only imagine how much more painful it was for my baby girl.\u00a0\u00a0Silver lining.\u00a0 Silver lining.\u00a0Ok.\u00a0 There was a silver lining to my baby\u2019s pain yesterday.\u00a0 Unfortunately for her, it was the joy that hockey game brought to her brother.\u00a0 It was the small amount of time that The Boy and his Daddy sat together on the glass and watched two awesome fights break out right in front of their eyes.\u00a0 It was the soda and popcorn and fist-pumping and cheering that The Boy ate up like candy.\u00a0\u00a0And it was the comfort I witnessed as The Boy took RM\u2019s hand in the car on the ride home and just held it for a spell.\u00a0 That damned silver lining was there in the moments of conversation that evening with The Boy and the opportunity to hear him recap the 2nd Period and how the glass shook from the glorious violence of a great game of hockey.\u00a0 I watched and listened as his face glowed while he spewed all the gory details.\u00a0\u00a0Then The Boy\u2019s tears came and I panicked and my heart pounded as I thought Dear GOD, what next?\u00a0 I cannot take any more suffering tonight!\u00a0 \u201cI felt so sorry that you and [RM] were stuck out in the lobby that whole time.\u00a0 I\u2019m sad that she hurt.\u201d\u00a0Silver lining.\u00a0 Silver lining.\u00a0\u201cI get that, Snugglebear.\u00a0 But you listen to me and you promise me something, ok?\u00a0 Don\u2019t you ever feel sorry for your sister.\u00a0 Not ever.\u00a0 She is happy.\u00a0 And she is perfect just like you.\u00a0 And she hurts sometimes, yes, just like you.\u00a0 But don\u2019t you ever feel sorry for her.\u201dI grabbed my son\u2019s increasingly large and lanky body up into my arms and squeezed him so tight.\u00a0 I felt so close to him and suddenly so relieved that this moment had come to me \u2013 a silver lining \u2013 out of a day of pain.\u00a0The Boy loves his baby sister and I am really so blessed.\u00a0 No matter the winds that howl around us and threaten to whip us up and batter our hearts \u2013 there\u00a0are beautiful days ahead.\u00a0 I will spend a little more time today being angry and feeling beaten because I am allowed to do so.\u00a0 We all are.\u00a0 But then I will step outside and welcome the sun once again.\u00a0It\u2019s what I do.\u00a0", "outgoing_links": ["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Autumn.jpg"], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2011/10/24/whip-me-up/", "title": "Whip Me Up"},

{"date": "April 16, 2011", "body": "Last weekend I had the most wonderful opportunity for a Mamas\u2019 Night Out in the real big city \u2013 New York.\u00a0My date was with another Warrior Mama.\u00a0 We had never actually met before, but we were sisters and knew each other as much.\u00a0 She is a military wife, too, and mother to three gorgeous babes \u2013 one with autism.\u00a0 We have a world of things in common.\u00a0 Little else in life can compare to that kind of kinship.\u00a0 Deployments and autism are not lifestyles that can be compared to anything else.\u00a0 Unless you live it \u2013 you just don\u2019t know.\u00a0 So I was thrilled at the chance to spend some time away from the day-to-day with a fellow Warrior Mama who gets it and gets how nice it is to be neither a military wife nor an autism mama for an afternoon \u2013 and who also knows how to have a good time and a lot of wine.\u00a0But this post isn\u2019t about my FABULOUS date with a fellow Warrior Mama \u2013 though I will get to that at a later time.This is about the train ride TO the big city.\u00a0 It\u2019s about our human connection and how our individual journeys through life on this rock are not so individual after all.Strap yourselves in for this one.\u00a7I was shockingly on time for my appointment with ME for once.\u00a0 I had gotten up early and enjoyed an unhurried cup of coffee. \u00a0I actually enjoyed picking out my outfit and getting dressed with a casual attitude of damn \u2013 I\u2019m still cute after all.\u00a0 I was feeling good.I kissed my SGM and kiddos goodbye and got in my truck, found my favorite song on the iPod and let \u2018er rip.\u00a0 It was an hour drive to the train, then it would be another two hours on the train.It was pretty close, but I made it to the station in time to board my train to freedom.\u00a0 I sat in a group of five face-to-face seats with a mom, her teen daughter, daughter\u2019s bestie and next to me was a young woman from London here on a 3-month internship with an ivy-league university hospital.\u00a0 Interesting, I thought.\u00a0 Our train pulled out of the station right on time.\u00a0 About 500 yards down the track we were stopped and told our engine was not working properly, we would be brought back to the platform to board the next train to Grand Central.\u00a0 Not the end of the world, I thought, it only put me about 30 minutes behind schedule but I would still make it in time to meet my Mama friend for lunch.Well.\u00a0 It\u2019s not like you get up and hold hands with your seatmates on the way to the new train so that you all can continue the conversation.\u00a0 That would be awkward.\u00a0 Instead, I boarded the new train and peered around for a seat next to someone that looked relatively showered and \u2018normal\u2019.\u00a0 The seatmate I chose was most definitely showered, and would prove to be nothing short of supernatural.I\u2019m a fanatical believer in what\u2019s meant to be.\u00a0 There are such things as simple coincidences, but this train ride would jolt me to the core.\u00a0The woman looked to be about my age.\u00a0 She had an LL Bean tote packed to the brim and was sipping a coffee.\u00a0 She had a calm, peaceful look on her face.\u00a0 She looked oddly familiar, but I have come to realize that those I have never met before who look familiar often do because my soul was expecting them.\u00a0We made the usual small talk.\u00a0 I felt instantly at ease with her, as if we were old friends.\u00a0 We exchanged itineraries of our trips to the big city.\u00a0 Turns out, we were both on a Mama\u2019s Night Out.\u00a0 Hers would be an overnight trip, and mine just a day trip.\u00a0 We both sighed as we delighted in the break from our busy lives as mommies.The conversation turned to how lovely it was to take this break.\u00a0 I shared that this was my first big solo adventure in a couple of years \u2013 that my husband had recently returned home from a deployment and my daughter diagnosed with autism.Wait for it \u2013\u201cMy cousin works for Autism Speaks,\u201d she says.\u201cReally? \u2013 What\u2019s her name?\u00a0 Maybe I have met her.\u201dYes, my friends \u2013 I knew this woman\u2019s cousin from various Autism Speaks events.There\u2019s more.\u201cSo, how did you know your daughter had autism?\u201d\u00a0 I turned sharply to see her face as the words jumped from her lips and landed on my heart with a sickening thud.\u00a0 Our delightful conversation had just imploded.\u00a0 We both would be changed forever with the approaching exchange.\u201cWell, we likely knew nearly a year before the diagnosis.\u00a0 I have a nephew with autism.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t think we were ready to add another diagnosis to the list quite yet.\u201d\u00a0 I went on to explain RM\u2019s 4q Deletion Syndrome \u2013 the feeding tube, open-heart surgery, the nearly constant sleepless nights wondering if she would still be with us in the morning.\u00a0I spoke in general terms, not wanting to overwhelm with med-speak.\u00a0 She countered with a tale that would leave me feeling like my roller coaster of the previous five years was a day at the spa.\u00a0She was the mother of five.\u00a0 10-year-old twins, an 8-year-old, 6-year-old and a nearly-three-year-old.\u00a0 After the twins survived birth at 28 weeks, she would later bring both of her daughters through battles with cancer.\u00a0 Cancer.\u00a0I listened intently as she described that this was her year \u2013 a year with healthy children and some time to regroup and just be a wife and mom, not a 24/hour nurse.\u00a0 Wow \u2013 I could relate to this.I told her I felt the same after the first three years caring for RM.\u00a0 That though there were obvious signs that she had autism \u2013 signs I was well-versed in \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t take another hit like that yet.\u00a0 Getting back to her initial question of how I knew, I described the hand-flapping and the toe-walking, and her lack of speech.A flood of tears poured from this mother\u2019s eyes.\u00a0 She started to shake.\u00a0 \u201cMy son is turning three and he toe-walks.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t have any real speech yet.\u201dIt was a punch to the gut I knew so intimately.\u00a0 I grabbed this woman and hugged her so tightly as I told her, \u201cyour son is still your son, and it will be ok.\u201dShe took a moment to compose herself and wipe away her tears.\u00a0 I waited patiently.\u00a0After a few silent minutes went by, we chatted some more.\u00a0 Now we were family.\u00a0 It\u2019s difficult to explain if you haven\u2019t been there \u2013 but there is a connection that is made when one parent to a child with autism finds themselves bumping into another.\u00a0 This bond \u2013 it instantly gives you a safe place to fall, a burst of strength when you need it and comfort in knowing you do not travel this journey alone.This amazing mother and I talked about the importance of taking time to renew, regroup and respond.\u00a0 I tried my damndest to provide her with the endorsement of getting that evaluation for her son when she was ready.\u00a0 That it would be hard, but that she wasn\u2019t alone and it was ok for her to breathe first.It was a moment that was meant to be.Our ride was near its end.\u00a0 The separation was awkward.\u00a0 I told her she could find me anytime through her cousin if she ever wanted to get together.She left the platform in one direction, and I in another.\u00a7We are all connected \u2013 for better and for worse.\u00a0 Whatever higher power or force of nature you believe in \u2013 know that it is not for naught.Our journeys are interwoven among a superhighway of life experiences that we share with one another.\u00a0 We are here for the purpose of being \u2013 not having.I have many things to be grateful for.I am blessed with open eyes and the opportunity to share in this life with others who ride the same train.\u00a0 None of us travel alone.\u00a0 Ever.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2011/04/16/throw-mama-from-the-train/", "title": "Throw Mama from the\u00a0Train"},

so I quickly hired the best special education attorney in the state at a cost of thousands of dollars.\u00a0 A luxury most families do not have.\u00a0 See HERE to learn how my husband got involved.\u00a0I read special education laws.\u00a0 I studied everything I could about treatments and therapies.\u00a0 I started looking into TRICARE and what was available through insurance.\u00a0 I had applied to our state\u2019s Department of Developmental Services when RM was born and found we were still on the wait-list for assistance.\u00a0 Medicaid gave me the run-around for nearly a year.\u00a0 I was appalled.\u00a0 And enraged.\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to know more.\u00a0 According to a Department of Defense (DoD) report, one in eighty-eight active duty dependent military children lives with autism.\u00a0 The epidemic is undeniable.\u00a0 Of those diagnosed, less than 10% are receiving the appropriate therapies they need to secure a hopeful future.\u00a0 Frequent changes of duty station, cycling deployments and disruption in family life are all overwhelming\u00a0obstacles to accessing appropriate therapies.\u00a0 And every time a military family moves, they drop back down to the bottom of the food chain for services.\u00a0I started a dialogue with my legislators.\u00a0 The numbers did the talking for me.\u00a0 Jaws dropped and silence filled the room \u2014 1 in 88.\u00a0 Our military children who send their mommies and daddies off to war are being left behind \u2014 without the treatments PROVEN to help them.\u00a0\u00a0It is fourteen months later; we finally have access to TRICARE\u2019s ECHO autism services and our school district has conceded to placing our daughter in an appropriate out-of-district program.\u00a0 Victory.\u00a0Along the way I learned many valuable lessons and met the most incredible people doing great things for our children.\u00a0 I have renewed faith in our legislators to do the right thing and make TRICARE cover autism benefits as part of standard care for active duty AND retired dependents.\u00a0 I feel empowered by the knowledge I have gained in this process and I look forward to passing it along to those beginning this journey themselves.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0April is the Month of the Military Child and Autism Awareness Month \u2014 we will continue to take every opportunity to share our story with anyone willing to listen.\u00a0 We will fight back the exhaustion, frustration and tears; so that in the absence of our soldiers, our families will find the courage to keep moving forward.\u00a0 We will continue to strive for a soft place to land for our kids out in the world \u2014 where they may find acceptance, compassion and a future filled with peace.\u00a0", "outgoing_links": ["http://stylepeterson.com/flowers/tulip-23.jpg", "http://myarmyreserve.dodlive.mil/2011/04/05/rms-story-a-familys-fight-for-hope-help-and-autism-awareness/", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/4qdeletion/", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/whatisit/index.php", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/church/", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/battleagainstautism/", "http://sites.google.com/site/orautismcoverage/FreedomofInformationAct-MilitaryDocu.pdf?attredirects=0", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/advocacy/", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/whattodo/index.php", "https://stimcity.wordpress.com/2011/03/26/retirementfree/"], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2011/04/26/come-may-flowers/", "title": "Come May Flowers"},

Ever.\u00a0 Drama?\u00a0 Forget it.\u00a0 Don\u2019t clog my day with that crap and for the heavenly sake of that guy named Pete \u2013 do yourself an even bigger favor and focus on what truly matters.\u00a0 I\u2019m so sorry your suit didn\u2019t come back from the cleaners and there were locusts.\u00a0 That really sucks for you.\u00a0 Hold your breath while you wait for my Hallmark card in the mail \u2013 that will put an end to your misery.We are at the end of Autism Awareness Month and I am exhausted by the needling, infighting and general lack of cohesion when it comes to autism and the Who, What, Where, When and How it all should be addressed.\u00a0 Quite frankly, since it all sounds like a Hatfield and McCoy episode of Scooby Doo, I never bothered meddling into what the actual arguments are.\u00a0 I just know some folks dislike Autism Speaks and I know there are celebrity autism experts that spend all of their energy nay-saying any treatments they don\u2019t agree with whether or not they work for any of our kids.There are those that consider it wrong to want to \u2018fix it\u2019 if God forbid you want to fix autism itself \u2013 or find a \u2018cure\u2019.\u00a0 In a life that leaves little room for strategic war-gaming of such things as my choice of idioms, pronouns and prefixes in everyday conversation \u2013\u00a0it\u00a0seems the emphasis is better placed on actual solutions rather than semantics.\u00a0\u00a0But that\u2019s just my lowly, humble opinion.My daughter is a Rock Star.\u00a0 BOTH of my children are Rock Stars.\u00a0 They are each unique, loving and amazing rugrats.\u00a0 Each has challenges, though vastly different from one another.\u00a0 My 7-year-old son is brilliant and handsome and has the biggest heart.\u00a0 He also is an elderly man in disguise and still hasn\u2019t caught on to the hype of riding a bicycle. \u00a0The Boy needs the tags cut out of all of his clothing, the shower is too loud for his ears and he cries \u2013 A LOT.\u00a0 He very well may need to start counseling soon as his emotions are truly overwhelming at times.Having 4q Deletion and autism as her own challenges, RM struggles with verbal communication, transitions from one activity to another, rather dislikes the word \u201cNo\u201d (unless she is using it) and carefully doles out her affection and emotions in strong, short bursts \u2013 occasionally with her hands.But is it wrong to want so desperately to wave a Magic Wand and make my children\u2019s challenges disappear?It\u2019s not your job to answer that for me.Is it wrong to want to \u2018fix\u2019 autism?It\u2019s not your place to decide that for my child.In this sometimes convoluted country of ours, parents are put on trial for neglecting to seek appropriate medical care for their ill children because their spiritual beliefs forbid scientific intervention.\u00a0 Yet millions of parents fighting tooth and nail to get help for their children with developmental disorders are being judged by a different jury for wanting to \u2018fix\u2019 their child.Give me that Magic Wand and I\u2019ll tell you what I would do with it.With one grand, sweeping stroke I would whisk away my children\u2019s pain in an instant \u2013 leaving nothing behind but a wispy trail of sparkled fairy dust.\u00a0 I would not wish the 4q deletion and autism away, or change the path of the journey itself.\u00a0 I know that challenges are inherent to learning and growing, and are therefore irreplaceable life experiences.\u00a0\u00a0Our struggles\u00a0shape who we are and make us unique and instantly recognizable by our Maker.\u00a0 Physical and emotional pain are a natural part of life as well.\u00a0 But can anyone honestly say they would not take away their child\u2019s stifling pain if that Magic Wand existed?\u00a0 You bet I would.\u00a0 And while I was at it, I\u2019d make all the clothing in this world tagless and soft as a baby\u2019s butt.Listen. \u00a0It\u2019s not about the language we use to describe our struggles, or the differences between what works for you or me.\u00a0 It\u2019s not about whether I say \u2018lives with autism\u2019 or \u2018is autistic\u2019 because I forgot for one moment to carefully craft my words into politically correct jargon. \u00a0Instead, it\u2019s about the commonality of wanting the best for our kids and adults living with special needs as defined by simple sensibility.Rather than nitpicking sound bites or the actual effectiveness of blue porch lights, let\u2019s get off our asses and change the world.We can start by providing the very best opportunity for people with developmental disorders to achieve meaningful communication whether by voice,\u00a0sign or machine. We can teach others what autism is from our own experiences without prejudice or judgment as to which end of the pool your autism treads water.\u00a0 We can offer that Warrior Mama on the ledge a bit of help rather than staring at the train wreck of her teenager melting down in the grocery store.\u00a0 We can offer her a night out and a few drinks without autism around \u2013 a personal favorite.We can hold our government and legislators accountable literally and monetarily to protect and provide the right to an appropriate and productive education as children and young adults.\u00a0 THEN we can continue that support for our adults with autism by accepting nothing less than the absolute right to live in a safe and comforting home\u00a0whether an individual lives independently, with family or with compassionate professionals.\u00a0 We can go one step beyond that and further support these individuals by helping them create a dignified, spirited sense of self by providing meaningful employment whenever possible.Lastly, it\u2019s not about the organization you work with or the title after your name.\u00a0 You are either invested in making the world a better place for people living with autism or you are not.\u00a0 This includes those of you not personally affected by autism \u2013 wait a minute \u2013 no such person exists.\u00a0 So invest yourself.\u00a0 Now.We all have a list of things that we would and would not change if given that Magic Wand.\u00a0 But my cape never came back from the cleaners and the tsunami of autism is coming whether I want it to or not.So how about we step out of Fantasy Land and instead of waving bogus wands around we just \u2018FIX IT\u2019?[Editor\u2019s note: Jess over at Diary of a Mom wrote a post that further discusses why different points of view are important, and I encourage you to read her fabulous account of her visit to The White House on behalf of all of us living with autism in our lives \u2013 which really means ALL OF US.]", "outgoing_links": ["http://theadventuresofboywonder.blogspot.com/2011/04/deep-end-of-pool.html", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2011/04/29/the-white-house-part-three-settle-in-this-could-take-a-while/", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2011/05/04/a-spectrum-of-words/"], "link": "https://stimcity.org/2011/04/29/hocus-pocus/", "title": "Hocus Pocus"},

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\u201dThese first\u00a0declaratives of freedom for men have evolved so very far already \u2013 to include women, to include people of color and persons with disabilities.\u00a0\u00a0Unfolding slowly over the last hundred years, it has at times gotten ugly along the way and we are far from the finish line.\u00a0 But we are getting there.\u00a0 And we must\u00a0push on to include EVERYONE in these unalienable rights.\u00a0 Not just with legislation but with action, with compassion, with love and tolerance.The few, like Bachmann,\u00a0who insert themselves in front of the camera and consistently spew hate and intolerance under the guise of political posturing for the \u2018future of our family values\u2019 shall someday find themselves alone and their voices\u00a0stifled.\u00a0 Because the REAL Americans who have yet to gather up collectively to speak WILL do so.\u00a0 They WILL rise up.\u00a0 And the message will be clear:\u00a0 We ARE a country of love and tolerance.\u00a0 We ARE \u2013 at our very core \u2013 Patriots.\u00a0 Patriots in the purest sense.\u00a0 Patriots dedicated to the founding values of this country.\u00a0 Values\u00a0that have continued to evolve and INDEED DO INCLUDE EVERY PERSON.\u00a0 Regardless of race, gender, sexuality or ability.Religiously, there\u00a0are those who speak of\u00a0\u2018God\u2019s Law\u2019, the Holy Bible\u00a0and the \u2018abomination\u2019\u00a0that is\u00a0homosexuality.\u00a0 I just do not see how anyone who claims to be a\u00a0follower of Christ could deny fellow brothers and sisters the right to pursue love and happiness and a full life.\nSo I feel the need to include another perspective \u2013 that of a mother to a beautiful little girl with a genetic abnormality.\u00a0 Someone who was \u2018born that way\u2019.\nWe are all creatures of God.\u00a0 Created by Him,\u00a0of His own design.\nMy daughter was born with a missing portion of her 4th chromosome.\u00a0 She has physical\u00a0and developmental disabilities directly related to her very design. \u00a0HIS design.\nThough my daughter was born with normal, working female genitalia, I do know many children with chromosome deletions that were designed by God with some anatomical differences.\u00a0 Whether those differences have\u00a0included both male and female parts, they\u00a0remain differences nonetheless.\u00a0 In some cases, the\u00a0biological gender of\u00a0a child is\u00a0truly up for interpretation.\nThe graphic nature of this conversation may be uncomfortable for some.\u00a0 But I can assure you these unique children \u2013 children of God like you and me \u2013 are uncomfortable, too.\u00a0 Whether their sexuality is affected by physical differences or sexual preference, they deserve love in this world.\u00a0 They\u00a0deserve to find a place in this world where they can learn of themselves and find value in the gift they are.\u00a0 They\u00a0deserve as everyone does\u00a0to move beyond\u00a0judgement and\u00a0discomfort and learn to walk tall knowing that regardless, GOD, their One Designer, made them as they are ON PURPOSE.\u00a0 God makes no accidents.\u00a0 We do.\u00a0 With our words, our fear and OUR expectations of how WE\u00a0interpret His design.\u00a0 So whether my daughter has a working vagina or if she had been born with ovaries and a penis \u2013 HE MADE HER THAT WAY.\u00a0 If her body in its uniqueness defines\u00a0the desires of her heart, who are we to judge what His plan for her is?\u00a0 And why would we think His plan included suffrage based on who she loves?Let me tell you.\u00a0 When RM was born and we received her genetic\u00a0karyotype [46,XX,del(4)(q32.2-ter)] we knew immediately that though her DNA said she was a girl, there could be any number of anatomical differences within her affecting her future sexual identity.\u00a0 That made absolutely no difference in how fiercely we loved her from the start.\u00a0 It made no difference in our desire to just want her to grow to be HAPPY.\u00a0 A hysteroscopy at age 3 confirmed that she had all of the normal organs\u00a0of a little girl.\u00a0 It was welcomed news, but it was really irrelevant in the bigger picture.\u00a0 She is our baby.\u00a0 And we love her just the way she is.\nJesus was sent to us to teach us to love one another.\u00a0 Above all else, that was the singular gift of Him.\u00a0 Yes, there were some guiding commandments and basic law that were also handed down.\u00a0 But like our Declaration of Independence, doesn\u2019t God also have the right to amend those ideals?\u00a0 He gave us the gift of Free Will \u2013 can He not adjust His own judgments as humans move forward?\u00a0 Thousands of years ago, a baby like mine rarely would have survived in the womb or surely would have\u00a0died\u00a0soon after birth.\u00a0 We have evolved.\u00a0 We now are witness to medical miracles every
