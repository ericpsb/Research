Yes, Autism sucks.\u00a0 Autism sucks the biggest, nastiest, most undesirable thing to suck that you can imagine.\u00a0 Other things suck equally and more.\u00a0 I would never claim that autism is the worst thing to happen to any person ever.\u00a0 That would be silly, and yet, some people like to indulge in such arguments, as if everyone\u2019s life experiences are not subjective and relative and defined by each individual.\u00a0 So, if anyone feels the need to type a statement such as \u201cit could be worse\u201d or \u201cat least it\u2019s not [cancer, cerebral palsy, death by fire, consumption by grizzly bear, etc.]\u201d or \u201cyou should appreciate your child\u2019s uniqueness\u201d, please, refrain from comment.\u00a0 Do me a favor and keep your thoughts to yourself.\u00a0 I don\u2019t need you judging my pain and suffering.\u00a0 I don\u2019t need your commentary on my joy and happiness.\u00a0 I don\u2019t need you. So there.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t mean to rant, but I kind of like it.\u00a0 I will leave it. The point that I am trying to get to is that despite the vast suckage that autism is, my kid is pretty damn happy.\u00a0 He smiles all the time.\u00a0 He loves school.\u00a0 He likes to go places.\u00a0 He loves his family.\u00a0 He loves to play.\u00a0\u00a0 He has the cutest little sense of humor.\u00a0 He is sneaky and mischievous.\u00a0 He only seems completely miserable when he is denied something that he wants, and , well, that\u2019s pretty typical. Yes, he does retreat into his stim-world with regularity.\u00a0 Don\u2019t we all need a break sometimes?\u00a0 Yes, he does have his frustrations that will only increase as he becomes older and more aware.\u00a0 But, we will deal with them as they come. Right now, he is pretty happy, and that does not suck. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://rebekahscot.wordpress.com/2010/04/22/why-my-life-does-not-suck-volume-1/", "title": "Why my life does not suck: Volume\u00a01"},

Recently, I can really identify with that couch. The couch is rarely fully put together.\u00a0 The cushions are removed and slung about, leaving its guts bare to be bounced upon by ungentle feet.\u00a0 It has springs popping out, coiled and ready to snag unsuspecting victims.\u00a0 It is covered with stains, some visible, others hidden and ingrained. You see, one of Hank\u2019s favorite activities is to dump all manner of everything onto that couch.\u00a0 To date, the list of abusive substances includes water, tea, sodas, coffee, five different colors of paint, toothpaste, chicken soup, diaper cream, lotion, whatever is inside a snow globe, rice, noodles and other unmentionables.\u00a0 I can clean the outside.\u00a0 The cushion covers have been stripped and washed so many times that one is ripped at the seams and no longer zips.\u00a0 But the inside, I\u2019m pretty sure that it is permanently scarred. I am that couch. Many nights when Hank falls asleep, oftentimes on that couch, I study him.\u00a0 His face in perfect repose.\u00a0 The even rise and fall of his chest.\u00a0 His eyelashes casting spiky shadows.\u00a0 And the feelings overwhelm me.\u00a0 The love, the sadness, the wonder, the determination.\u00a0 It makes me heavy.\u00a0 It makes me light. John will carry Hank off to bed, and the couch and I will breath a sigh of relief.\u00a0 If it\u2019s not too late, John and I will watch some TV, frequently cuddled together on a single couch cushion because the other is getting over its most recent trauma.

{"date": "December 16, 2009", "body": "I have been thinking further on the expectations game.\u00a0 As noted, I have decided to unfetter\u00a0myself of the crazy high expectations and just go with the flow.\u00a0 Now, this does not change our approach in any way.\u00a0 Do not label us laissez-faire.\u00a0 We will be working, striving, figuring out how to circumvent the many brick walls that we will run into, all on Hank\u2019s behalf.\u00a0 Never doubt it.\u00a0 This is more a\u00a0move toward acceptance and practicality.\u00a0 A change in viewpoint, backing off just a bit to observe and process. So, we were at church Sunday night.\u00a0 We don\u2019t attend as regularly as we should.\u00a0 We often keep Hank at home because having him in the church service is an impossibility and I hate to leave him in the nursery all the time.\u00a0 But, we all went this night because Dagney was in the kids\u00a0Christmas musical.\u00a0 I watched the dress rehearsal because I was expecting to have to chase Hank through the halls or stay in the nursery with him during the actual performance.\u00a0 However, he was perfectly content in the nursery, so I gave the workers my cell number with instructions to text me if needed and to keep him away from the animal crackers.\u00a0 It was very nice (weird, actually) to be able to sit with my husband and watch our oldest perform. Afterward, there was a church social.\u00a0 To put it in perspective, the last event of this type that we attended was a Thanksgiving dinner a few weeks previous.\u00a0 We had to put Hank in a highchair\u00a0to contain him, and once he could no longer be peacefully contained,\u00a0the adults took shifts following him around and keeping his hands out of the myriad of food dishes that were\u00a0on display, our version of gluten/casein keep-away involving lots of quick side-to-side shuffling to block his path to the pigs in blankets (pigs-in-blankets?\u2026pig-in-blankets?\u2026surely all those little wieners don\u2019t add up to more than one pig).\u00a0\u00a0Quick sum up, he ran all over the place squealing like a pig (possibly in a blanket), and I broke out in a sweat\u2026.and hives.\u00a0 I was glad to leave. But, on this peaceful night, it was different.\u00a0 He was different.\u00a0\u00a0Possibly still enjoying the afterglow effects of sitting in church with my husband, I was different.\u00a0 I got a plate for myself and Hank and\u00a0sat down.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t get the highchair, which is from the\u00a0\u201970s and makes me consider a tetanus booster just looking at it.\u00a0 When John returned from the bathroom with Hank in tow, I put him in a regular chair.\u00a0 Heck, why not! Maybe he will stay.\u00a0 I was feeling\u00a0adventurous. Well, the kid stayed\u2026for quite a while, relatively speaking.\u00a0 He tried to scam food off my plate and didn\u2019t complain when I shut those efforts down.\u00a0 I relented and gave him some Sprite instead of the supplement-laden drink that I had been pushing for much of the day.\u00a0\u00a0After a bit, he got out of the chair with a sly look in my direction.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t run, didn\u2019t even get beyond three feet from the chair.\u00a0 I gave him a\u00a0sly smile right back and\u00a0patted the chair with an instruction to sit back down.\u00a0 He did.\u00a0 (He did!!)\u00a0 We did this a few more times.\u00a0 He responded quickly and appropriately every time with lots of eye contact (and obvious scheming going on behind those baby blues). We continued the game for a bit, with him sitting at the table for the majority of the time.\u00a0 We all got to eat in peace.\u00a0 The chase-after-Hank rotation was not necessary.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t suddenly breaking out and itching in places that are inappropriate to scratch in the middle of a church fellowship hall.\u00a0 It was awesome!\u00a0 He did start testing the limits after a while.\u00a0 I knew that he would soon be on the move when he started laying down on his back on the floor, dry humping the air and laughing like a hyena.\u00a0 But, he was still playing the game with me during all that, he was still close to the chair, he was still looking me in the eye and waiting for some response from me.\u00a0 Dry hump away, little buddy!!\u00a0 I was so happy about his behavior that I didn\u2019t care that he was crossing over into goofy land.\u00a0 Heck, I decided to go with him.\u00a0 I gave him a good tickling and gave him leave to run.\u00a0 Someone followed him, and the rest of us remaining at the table marveled at how well he had done.\u00a0\u00a0 I left smiling and not scratching. I was tumbling this whole experience around in my mind last night while laying in bed, and I realized that there was a whole other expectations game to consider.\u00a0 The game of low expectations.\u00a0 Not giving my kid enough credit.\u00a0 Not allowing him the chance to shine.\u00a0 On a whim, I plopped his happy ass in a regular chair.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t confine him.\u00a0 And, he made me proud.\u00a0 I have to remember to give him a little more credit a little more often. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rebekahscot.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/high-chair3.jpg"], "link": "https://rebekahscot.wordpress.com/2009/12/16/further-on-the-subject-of-expectations/", "title": "A little credit,\u00a0please\u2026."},

We very briefly considered finding a huge cardboard box and filling it with hangers.\u00a0 Then we discussed how someone really should come up with a hanger with flashing lights on it or one that played music. You see, about the only thing that Hank has been playing with for a while now is plastic coat hangers.\u00a0 He freaking loves them.\u00a0 He stacks them neatly.\u00a0 He throws them around to form chaotic patterns.\u00a0 He jumps up and down while holding them to his face so that they click against each other and hit against his belly.\u00a0 He plays with them in the bathtub.\u00a0 He sorts them by color on occasion.\u00a0 Every now and then he will walk around carrying about 25 of them looped on his arms.\u00a0 It\u2019s bizarrely cute. The only other toys that interest him right now are\u00a0super-stimtastic things that\u00a0sing, dance or light up.\u00a0 Being the holiday season, these things have come out of the woodwork.\u00a0 Dancing Christmas trees,\u00a0 singing snowmen, a reindeer in a rocking chair that plays \u201cGrandma got run over by a reindeer\u201d.\u00a0 Ironically, it\u2019s his grandma that has that last one. So, there we stood in Target, the emotional quagmire threatening to pull us under.\u00a0 We took a moment to acknowledge how much the situation sucked and we moved on, determined to find something that would make our special kiddo happy.\u00a0\u00a0And we did.\u00a0 We hope.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what\u00a0we got. A blow-up ball tent shaped like a car, a big fire truck with all sorts of buttons for noises and lights, a toy with gears that turn and\u2026a singing Christmas tree.\u00a0 Yes, it will be Christmas all year round in the Galt house!\u00a0 At least until\u00a0one\u00a0of us cracks and buries the singing tree in the backyard or\u00a0runs over it with the car.

{"date": "December 15, 2009", "body": "We all have expectations for how our lives will unfold, what our stories will be.\u00a0 I am a smart person.\u00a0 I graduated high school valedictorian and skated through college with relative ease.\u00a0 I married a really smart guy with a sharp wit to match my own.\u00a0 Naturally, I expected we would eventually hear the pitter patter of little genius feet\u2026possibly the next Einstein or Salk.\u00a0 Well, maybe not, but I expected some smart little rugrats. Now, I did have my fears.\u00a0 My younger brother had leukemia at the age of 2 and was debilitated by a rare brain damaging side effect of his treatment.\u00a0 He went into remission, but he was left developmentally and physically disabled.\u00a0 Then at the age of 8, he developed a brain tumor and died despite several surgical interventions.\u00a0 How did my parents deal with such grief and still maintain their marriage, their family, their faith?\u00a0 THIS, I  did  fear.\u00a0 This was real to me. What was entirely out of my reality? Of all the things that could happen to one of my children, what was the most far afield?\u00a0 Out of sight.\u00a0 Out of mind.\u00a0 Didn\u2019t even exist for me. AUTISM. Our daughter is everything that we expected.\u00a0 Our son is something entirely different.\u00a0 He is a mystery wrapped in an enigma.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t conform to expectations.\u00a0 He has autism. So, expectations change, right?\u00a0 We roll with the punches.\u00a0 We set new goals.\u00a0 We develop a plan.\u00a0 We will implement this diet, this protocol, these services.\u00a0 Surely, everything will work out.\u00a0 Surely, our son will be just fine, some semblance of normal, in a year or two.\u00a0 Surely, he will be talking soon.\u00a0 Maybe he will even lose the label.\u00a0 These were our new expectations. Well, we were just a tad unrealistic.\u00a0 Not that it doesn\u2019t happen.\u00a0 Some kids respond significantly, improve rapidly, find the elusive \u201cWOW\u201d factor.\u00a0 However, it hasn\u2019t happened for our beautiful boy.\u00a0 There has been improvement, but it has been slow and plodding.\u00a0 He is a tortoise in this race.\u00a0 We can only hope for the same winning outcome. So, within the confines of our original expectations, birthdays only served to put a spotlight on our epic failure, increase our sense of doom.\u00a0 The small progressive steps and gains couldn\u2019t be fully appreciated because they didn\u2019t measure up.\u00a0 The tick, tick, tick of the passage of time became the soundtrack for our lives because he should be doing THIS by THIS age.\u00a0 So said our expectations anyway. It\u2019s damn depressing, this expectations paradigm.\u00a0 This box so many parents close themselves up in.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard\u00a0to avoid it, but it is soul crushing if you allow yourself to be trapped in it. For that reason (because I value my soul), I am DONE.\u00a0 No more expectations for me\u2026.at least no more of those short-term, time-sensitive, soul-sucking black holes falsely labeled as hope.\u00a0 We will continue to improve the life and health of our baby.\u00a0 We will address his gut issues, his methylation deficiencies, his viral and bacterial load.\u00a0 Inevitably, he will improve,\u00a0it\u2019s just not likely to be on any predetermined timeline.\u00a0 I am determined to enjoy every incremental improvement, whether large or small, whether quickly gained or laboriously attained. We will maintain our hope for his future.\u00a0 We will have faith in our efforts and the decisions we make.\u00a0 We believe that he will talk.\u00a0 That he will be happy and healthy.\u00a0 That he will be okay.\u00a0 These are my long-term expectations.\u00a0 I am not putting a timeline on\u00a0them, and these expectations are bound to be redefined and molded by the progress that he makes. Whatever happens, we love and treasure him, and we will love the person that he becomes.\u00a0 That is an expectation that I don\u2019t mind having. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rebekahscot.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/calendar.jpg"], "link": "https://rebekahscot.wordpress.com/2009/12/15/expectations/", "title": "Expectations"},

She actually tried to get him in bed the other night.\u00a0 John and I watched on the other side of the closed door as the light flicked on, then off, then back on.\u00a0 We heard Hank laughing and Dagney trying to coax him to bed.\u00a0 We peaked through the cracked door to see Dagney lightly body slamming Hank into his bed and then trudging back to turn the light off with an audible sigh.\u00a0 It made my outside laugh and my inside hurt\u00a0just a bit at the same time.\u00a0 We praised her highly for the game effort then we all went back to playing Super Mario on the Wii. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rebekahscot.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/bob-bedding.jpg"], "link": "https://rebekahscot.wordpress.com/2009/12/30/holiday-this-n-that/", "title": "Holiday this-n-that\u2026."},

I know that she longs for a normal sibling.\u00a0 She wants another brother or sister.\u00a0 One that will play with her.\u00a0 I long for that for her, but it\u2019s just not practical.\u00a0 I only ever wanted two children.\u00a0 But now\u2026if I was a bit younger\u2026if we were more financially set\u2026if we had a bigger house\u2026if, if, if\u2026I would do my best to give her that normal sibling experience.\u00a0 A little while back, I thought I was pregnant.\u00a0 It turned out that I was not, and I mourned that little life that blipped in and out of existence, if only in my mind.\u00a0 I mourned the loss of that chance for Dagney to have normal sibling interaction.\u00a0 I regretted the loss of that chance for it to not all be on her small shoulders one day. She loves him.\u00a0 Despite the fact that he raids her closet for her clothes hangers.\u00a0 Despite the fact that he blows through her room like a miniature tornado.\u00a0 Despite the fact that we don\u2019t always get to go and do things that many families do with ease.\u00a0 Despite the fact that she has to explain him to her friends.\u00a0 Hopefully, her sibling experience will teach her so many of the good lessons in life\u2026tolerance, understanding, hope, patience, humor, love.\u00a0 I see all of these attributes blooming in her already.\u00a0 Some of them more than others.\u00a0 Hopefully, we can avoid the thorns and pitfalls\u2026bitterness, jealousy, hate. \u201cLife\u2019s not all pickles and rainbows.\u201d Maybe Hank is the pickle.\u00a0 Maybe autism is the pickle.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s one of those sweet pickles, so that if you have to eat a pickle, it\u2019s the best possible pickle.\u00a0 Maybe I am giving her too much credit, and she was just talking nonsense to mess with me.

{"date": "December 1, 2010", "body": "I have been doing a little bit if writing elsewhere. This is one of a few pieces that I contributed to a book that is being released in April 2010.\u00a0 This is the unedited version\u2026over 1000 words!!\u00a0 I received a request from a lovely young lady to trim it down to 250 for the final submission to the publisher.\u00a0 I managed to get it down to 399.\u00a0 Yay me!! Dealing with autism is just plain hard, regardless of where your kid falls on the spectrum. The problems and needs vary according to each child, but it all boils down to one simple concept. Your kid is different. Describe them however you like: quirky, unique, special, extra-normal, hard-headed, beautiful, frustrating, wonderful. Describe autism however you like: a disease, a disorder, a genetic condition, a blessing, a curse, just a normal part of everyday life. Approach the treatment of autism however you like: Biomed, special diets, Applied Behavioral Analysis, occupational therapy, medications, no treatment at all. Despite the many ways that we as parents of autistic kids can differ, there is one way in which we will always be the same. Our kids are different, and that is just hard. The reality of our kids\u2019 struggles is something that we face every single day, and it certainly takes a toll on the mind, heart and body. I have had some bad days, and, no doubt, I will have more. However, while I am certainly not reticent to air my emotional laundry, I do not want to do that right now or in this section of the book. I would rather write about a few important conclusions that I have come to as a result of my bad days\u2026and my good days\u2026and the space in between. Feel It Life\u2019s many difficulties are bound to stir up all sorts of emotions, but I have found having a child with autism to be particularly emotionally confounding. There are so many instances in which you simultaneously feel completely opposing emotions. Joy and grief. Acceptance and anger. Guilt and absolution. Other times, one emotion, usually a bad one, is so all encompassing that you can physically feel it pressing in on you. During the good times, you can feel a high that no drug can induce. One thing that I know for certain, whatever you are feeling, it is completely normal. In my experience, it is best to let yourself feel all of them. Recognize them and sort them out into neat, little categories if you want to. My preferred labels are \u201ctotally awesome \u2013 enjoy it while it lasts\u201d and \u201creally sucky, but it\u2019s just how I feel right now\u201d and \u201ctotally counterproductive \u2013 stop right now.\u201d Just feel it, whatever it is. If you try to ignore or shave the blunt edges off of anger, guilt, grief, it may retreat only to return later stronger and meaner for not having been recognized and dealt with in the first place. If you try to tamp down your joy because you think it will hurt that much more when a downward spiral hits, you are depriving yourself of the best moments in life. Ride the emotional roller coaster. If you are not constantly trying to get off the ride, you might find that the highs are more enjoyable and the lows are more tolerable. Share It All those feelings that you have? You don\u2019t own the exclusive rights to them. Others are being knocked over by that very same emotional tsunami. Others share the same joys and heartaches. You may feel totally alone and cut off from the world, but, honestly, that is some pretty self-centered thinking. You\u2019re not living in a vacuum in which you are the only one effected by your child\u2019s diagnosis. Your spouse or partner, the person sleeping in the same bed with you every night, is struggling too. You need to share your feelings, communicate, confess your fears and bad thoughts to each other. Do not assume that he is doing just fine. Do not assume that you baring your soul will bring him down or increase his burden. There is no good reason for you to both seperately carry around the same weight. If you share it, it will lighten the load on both of you. Neither of you have to feel alone. I used the example of a spouse, but the \u201cshare it\u201d rule applies to other family and friends. There are other people out there feeling the same way that you do. Find them and build a community for yourself in which you feel safe, in which you can share without being judged, in which you can give and receive support. The autism experience strips you of all pretense. You need to surround yourself with people who don\u2019t mind you streaking around emotionally naked, the kind of honest folks who will likely strip down and run around with you. Those are the people that know, because they feel it too. Tell It There is a whole other sub-set of people in your life that you might not want to share it with, but you just might want to tell it to. The co-worker set, the lady at the bakery that knows your name because you come in too many mornings to tank up on coffee and donuts set, the Judgey McJudgerson in the grocery store set. I do not feel that it is my duty to inform the masses about autism, and I don\u2019t necessarily work the big \u201cA\u201d into every casual conversation that I have. However, I find a certain comfort in talking about it. Some times, it is an effort to educate in general. Other times, it springs from a desire for people to know me and to know my child. I tell it in the hope that the next time that I am having a crap day, that person might just understand and give me a supportive smile\u2026or that the next time Judgey McJudgerson sees a child acting oddly or tantruming in a store, she doesn\u2019t turn up her haughty nose or scowl or say something demeaning to that parent because just maybe she understands that she can\u2019t possibly know what that child and that parent are dealing with\u2026or when my co-worker sees a child in her family that has issues, she recalls our conversation and gets earlier intervention for that child. I like to tell it, but that\u2019s just me. Not everyone does, and that is just fine too. Screw It Some days just suck, for any variety of reasons. I won\u2019t bother to give examples; you have already experienced them. Sometimes you just have to say screw it. Screw autism. Screw this day. Do whatever you have to do to release all the negative emotions. Cry it out. Break plates. Punch a pillow. Go outside and scream at the heavens. After that\u2026screw it. You can\u2019t let one bad day bleed into the next. If you let that happen, your life can turn into an endless succession of bad days, and you\u2019re very likely to miss out on some of the good things. You have to let tomorrow be a new day with a clean slate. Confess It Here is where I confess something to you. I frequently really suck at following my own advice. There are many days in which positive, healthy coping just doesn\u2019t happen. There are days when I want to hide and not face the world. There are days when I insist on keeping it all inside, even when I know that it is in there growing all sorts of nasty cooties and possibly tentacles. But, I have my box full of coping tools, and more often than not and in my own time, I manage to dig through it and find the tool that I need. \ufeff \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rebekahscot.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/wordy.jpg"], "link": "https://rebekahscot.wordpress.com/2010/12/01/while-i-havent-been-writing-here/", "title": "While I haven\u2019t been writing\u00a0here\u2026"},

Some days, I forget that it\u2019s even there.\u00a0 It\u2019s not as if life is perfect on those days.\u00a0 Life just happens, and I deal with it, good or bad.\u00a0 Shit might happen, but I\u2019m able to shrug my shoulders and move on.\u00a0 Or even better, shit might not happen, and all is good. Then there are the other days, the days when just dealing is not my forte.\u00a0 The worst are the days that masquerade as the good, level, calm days, but then it hits the fan.\u00a0 On those days, for whatever reason, I am vulnerable, and I don\u2019t even realize it.\u00a0 I get blindsided.\u00a0 It can go something like this\u2026 I\u2019m standing in the checkout line at the grocery store.\u00a0 The 3-year-old in the cart in front of me is chattering away.\u00a0 Geez, she\u2019s practically reciting her doctoral thesis, and mom isn\u2019t even paying attention.\u00a0 I\u2019m seeing the future of America here, folks, lucky freaking me!\u00a0 Hank is almost 5, and he doesn\u2019t say a single recognizable word.\u00a0 Will he ever tell me he loves me?\u00a0 Does he even understand when I say it to him?\u00a0 I get a lump in my throat, a hollow ache in my chest.\u00a0 I feel something under my foot, and I look down.\u00a0 I\u2019ve stepped on a panic button\u2026damn it. \n Or\u2026 I read a Facebook status posted by a friend with an autistic child the same age as Hank.\u00a0 Wow!\u00a0 He is doing really great.\u00a0 I am so happy for them!\u00a0 Fully potty trained!\u00a0 That is fantastic!\u00a0 Yeah, that\u2026is\u2026great.\u00a0 Will Hank ever be potty trained?\u00a0 Will we still be changing his diapers when he is 14?\u00a0 I push away from the computer, but it\u2019s too late.\u00a0 I have already hit the big, red panic key that I swear wasn\u2019t on my keyboard just a few minutes ago.  That\u2019s how it often goes.\u00a0 My panic button is a stealthy little bastard.\u00a0 I step on it.\u00a0 I sit on it.\u00a0 Sometimes a dirty look will set it off.\u00a0 Some days it patiently follows me around until I acknowledge it\u2019s presence, no subterfuge necessary.\u00a0 Some days it\u2019s almost comforting.\u00a0 I will sit at my desk and tap-tap-tap a rhythm on it while all the awful doubts and scary questions scroll through my head like the opening credits of a Star Wars movie.

That night, I was lying in bed enveloped in a rare sense of calm.\u00a0 I imagined my panic button sitting on my bedside table, placed carefully behind the alarm clock so that I wouldn\u2019t accidentally hit it instead of the snooze button.\u00a0 I thought about my evening.\u00a0 It had been so lovely.\u00a0 I had seen something that had not been visible to me for the last six months.\u00a0 I imagine that it was there all along in some degree, but I was incapable of seeing it. I saw progress.\u00a0 Hank has made progress.\u00a0 He is understanding so much more.\u00a0 He is following directions.\u00a0 He is looking us in the eye more often.\u00a0 He is playing games with us.\u00a0 He is interacting in more meaningful ways.\u00a0 He is as cute and joyful as he has always been, and more so.\u00a0 I saw what I needed to see that night.\u00a0 And trust me, I really needed to see it.\u00a0 It was like food for my soul. So, my kid has autism.\u00a0 I have a panic button.\u00a0 It is what it is.\u00a0 It is my beautiful life. \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rebekahscot.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/panic-button.jpg"], "link": "https://rebekahscot.wordpress.com/2010/07/29/panic-button/", "title": "Panic button\u2026"},
{"date": "December 6, 2010", "body": "If only we were dealing with just one bad apple. If only\u2026 I\u2019m noticing a trend.\u00a0 One doesn\u2019t have to be highly enlightened or even have above average observation skills to see it either.\u00a0 It\u2019s appallingly obvious. We autism parents deal with an inordinately high number of bad apples. Bad apples that do not listen, do not understand, do not empathize, do not sympathize, do not care, do not do their jobs well, do not have any manners, do not show any respect,\u00a0 do not mean what they say, do not say what they mean, do not do what they say, do not say what they do.\u00a0 Bad apples of all shapes and sizes.\u00a0 Bad apples in abundance. It would be really nice if the bad apples could simply be plucked from the group and tossed to the side like so much garbage, allowed to decay out of sight and out of mind, leaving an open slot for a potentially good apple. Our current most egregious bad apple is the Special Education Coordinator for Hank\u2019s school.\u00a0 I call her Spitch.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure y\u2019all are smart enough to guess the origins of that moniker.\u00a0 She attends all of Hank\u2019s IEP meetings, four so far this year.\u00a0 She puts a big smile on her face and tells us how much she cares about Hank\u2019s education.\u00a0 I don\u2019t believe a single word that spills out her bad-apple-piehole.\u00a0 We asked for a very specific educational service at the beginning of the year, a service that everyone but her agrees is reasonable and necessary.\u00a0 She has offered several alternative solutions that really are not solutions at all. I am tired of this game.\u00a0 An entire half of a school year has passed already.\u00a0 Too much time has been wasted, and I\u2019m beginning to think that this was Spitch\u2019s plan all along.\u00a0 Stall, stall, stall\u2026then the year will be over, and she will not have had to imperil her precious budget.\u00a0 I totally fell into her trap, but I\u2019m disentangling myself from her snares.

A kiss\u2026a sweet, innocent, oh-so-longed-for little smooch from my precious little boy. That is what I got last night.\u00a0 It isn\u2019t the first time Hank has kissed me.\u00a0 He actually gives them rather freely upon request.\u00a0 If he doesn\u2019t offer full lips, he will offer an upturned cheek for me to smack.\u00a0 For about a month a while back, I also got lots of tongue.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t request that, he just gave it.\u00a0 He will also purse his lips and offer them up unsolicited when (a) he has done something wrong and been scolded and (b) he wants something that I have. But last night, I received the first ever not-a-bribe, not-a-beg-for-forgiveness, not-asked-for, not-initiated-by-me KISS.\u00a0 Oh, yes.\u00a0 It was the sweetest thing ever. Here\u2019s how it happened. He was really tired.\u00a0 I had gone outside, and I returned to find Hank wandering the house in search of me, big crocodile tears running down his cheeks.\u00a0 His sad face is the best\u2026many a young girl will fall prey to that face in the future.\u00a0 He led me to Dagney\u2019s bed and asked (in his way) me to lay down with him to watch Spongebob.\u00a0 I laid on my side and he sat leaning against my stomach.\u00a0 After a few calming moments filled with intermittent sniffles, he turned to me and leaned in for a smooch.\u00a0 Just because he loves me. The funny thing is that I have longed for this exact thing the last week or so\u2026sweet, unsolicited, simple affection.\u00a0 When I lay in bed with him at night, I put my hand in a spot for him to conveniently hold it\u2026just in case he decides he wants to.\u00a0 Do you remember doing that on first dates?\u00a0 Placing your hand just so to make it easily accessible?\u00a0 It\u2019s like that. *Dreamy sigh* He held my hand last night too. *insert smitten teenage girl giggle here* \n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x{max-width:610px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div{float:left;margin-right:10px;}\n\t\t\tdiv.wpmrec2x div.u > div:nth-child(3n){margin-right:0px;}\n\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://rebekahscot.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/kiss_concertlive.jpg"], "link": "https://rebekahscot.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/kiss/", "title": "Kiss\u2026"}
