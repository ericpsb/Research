He had a pencil drawing of himself with one arm outstretched, reaching upwards to a star that emanated beams of light. Here is what he said:\n\u201cThis is a poster idea for a movie that I\u2019m going to be in. It\u2019s called The Movie Traveler. I am live-action, and I go into the land of Disney animated movies to be their guardian, because they\u2019ve been searching for one for 40 years. And I help them. In the end I realize that other people are just as important as me. That without them, I am nothing. In order to save myself, I have to save both dimensions.\u201d\nI had him repeat those last few sentences so that I could get it all down. Maybe I\u2019m reaching here. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into what he said. Maybe some lines are from a movie he recently watched. But I can\u2019t help thinking that the fact that he said it is a step in the right direction. And \u201cboth dimensions\u201d? To me that\u2019s like the autistic mind and the non-autistic mind. He wants to \u201csave\u201d both. Affirm the importance of both. Maybe even try to understand both. Am I grasping?\nIt reminds me of the first few years after his diagnosis, when I grasped at therapies, books, treatments, supplements \u2013 anything I thought would help. And some of it did, immensely. Now, years later, when he takes these steps, I grasp at them. Because it seems like he\u2019s reaching when he says these things. And if he is, I want to make sure I\u2019m there, meeting him half-way. And if he\u2019s not, I\u2019ll be there anyway.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/12/12/reaching/", "title": "Reaching"},
{"date": "July 1, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\u00a0*\nSome of you may recall that a couple of weeks ago I mentioned that I would be taking Nigel and Aidan to the Grand Canyon when I go to visit them during their two-month stay at their dad\u2019s house. Some of you may also recall that in April I mentioned that I would be going to Nepal this summer with Knowledge for People to do an autism educational volunteer program. And some of you may be as excited as I am when I tell you that I am doing both trips!\nFriday morning I fly to LA, and I\u2019ll spend the 4th with my extended family members who live there \u2013 Dad, brother and sister-in-law, and my sister. (In case you\u2019re\u00a0curious \u2013 I\u2019m actually from LA. I moved up to Oregon to go to college and ended up staying. It\u2019s that beautiful. Funny thing, Nigel and Aidan\u2019s dad is also from LA, but we met and married in Oregon. Just a little Tanya Trivia for you.) Anywaaaayyy, then I am renting a car and picking up the boys to go to the Grand Canyon for a few days. This will be my fourth time there, and the first for them. I\u2019m looking forward to sharing it with them, but really, I just can\u2019t wait to see them and hug them. I\u2019ve missed them so much already.\nAfter I return Nigel and Aidan to their dad\u2019s house, I will fly out of LAX for Nepal. I\u2019ve spent the last week preparing two presentations I\u2019ll be giving \u2013 one on sensory issues, and the other on my parenting experience. I\u2019m the only parent of an autistic child on the team going to Nepal, and I feel so humbled to be speaking to these parents and teachers (through an interpreter). How can I talk about the challenges of raising a child with autism, when I have no idea how challenging their lives already are? Who am I to talk to them about challenges?! They are in a country with no resources for their child! But we are hoping to help with that, and I am honored to be a part of this. \u00a0I prepared outlines of my presentations and sent them to the director of Knowledge for People, and she will forward them to the founders of the newly-formed autism center in Kathmandu who, I hope, will have the outlines translated prior to our arrival. That way the parents will have something to refer to while the interpreter and I are speaking to them, and they\u2019ll have some written material to take home with them.\nAnd in case I sound all nonchalant as I\u2019m mentioning that I\u2019ll be traveling to Nepal and speaking to a group of people and having my words translated and all, don\u2019t let the casual tone of my writing fool you. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this!!! I can\u2019t believe, after months of planning and preparation and thinking can I really do this?, that the time has come and I am doing it!! Talk about taking a leap! I\u2019m a little nervous, but fortunately my excitement seems to be overriding my butterflies.\nSo, my friends, the blog will be quiet for a while. We\u2019re supposed to have internet access in one of the places we\u2019re staying, but I am laptopless, so I\u2019m not planning on posting during my absence. That just means I\u2019ll have plenty to post about when I return! (And I\u2019ll be swamped with work to catch up on, but we won\u2019t talk about that now.) I\u2019ll be back in Oregon on July 28, and I promise I\u2019ll post as soon as my jetlag fog clears.

{"date": "July 30, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tHow can I even begin to tell you about my trip? I guess I can start by saying that what Meg from The Pages of Our Crazy Life commented about (me) \u201ccoming back a changed woman\u201d turned out to be entirely true. And I knew that the trip would change me, but I had no idea in what ways and to what extent. It was the kind of experience that makes you question and/or appreciate so many things about your life. Questioning my priorities. Learning new truths. Appreciating\u00a0what\u00a0we have \u2013 and\u00a0what we don\u2019t have. Realizing that friendship transcends culture and language, and that the emotions we experience as autism parents are universal and run so deep, even on the other side of the world.\nI came home three days ago to a 108-degree heat wave, a cat-scratched leather couch, and an ant infestation. I have three-foot-high weeds in my yard (that somehow grew in the heat), a major work deadline (that was already extended because of the trip), and about two hundred unread/unanswered emails (that I can\u2019t even begin to tackle). I\u2019ve missed blogging like crazy. And let me just say that this 108-degree heat wave actually feels good compared to the 87% humidity and heat in Nepal. I\u2019m serious.\nI think the only way I can write about this nearly month-long trip is to break it up into segments \u2013 because that\u2019s exactly how it happened. I started off by celebrating the Fourth of July with the SoCal contingent of my extended family. Then I went with my brother and sister to visit our childhood homes, picked up my sons and took them to the Grand Canyon, spent a day on the beach with my dad, went winetasting with some relatives, and then flew to Nepal for two weeks, where I experienced so many amazing things. And all of it begs to be written about.\nSo, my friends, if you\u2019ll indulge me, I\u2019ll feature a particular part or topic of my trip in several different posts over the next couple of weeks. I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it justice otherwise. I\u2019ll also need to spread the posts out a bit because my boss was right about something (as she often is).\u00a0 I dragged myself into work Tuesday morning, after approximately 22 hours of plane time. My boss gave me a hug and told me it\u2019ll take a week for me to get over the jetlag. I waved it off and said, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll be fine in three days.\u201d Well, today is the third day, and all I can say is \u2013 What the hell do I know?!\n\nCarved wooden doors at the Kathmandu Airport.

{"date": "December 14, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tYesterday I attended the first family-centered support group meeting for ASD families in southern Oregon. I\u2019ve previously attended other support groups for parents, and they were always welcoming, but I felt like something was missing. I would leave without feeling better than when I had arrived. It wasn\u2019t the type of support group I was looking for.\nThis one yesterday was different. It was so affirming to have the kids there. The parents, the ASD kids, and the siblings all there, all interacting \u2013 it just felt right. I met other parents also at the teen stage as well as others just starting out. The level of understanding was inherent, as was the bond. I saw tiredness on some of their faces, and stress. But I also saw hope.\nAnd the hope was there because the older kids were there. I saw some young parents watching Nigel, and that gave me a sense of pride. Because I know how far he\u2019s come. I still have many concerns about the future, of course. But if Nigel, just as he is, can give some young parents hope for their child\u2019s development, that\u2019s something. That\u2019s really something.\nI did the same thing when I went to the autism and puberty seminar that I attended in October. One of the presenters at the seminar was a higher-functioning autistic adult. All the parents were rapt as we listened to her, watched her, absorbed her. She was hope to us, those of us with teens. She patiently answered questions, related stories of her childhood and teenage years, what she had been like. We all wanted to know when she had started talking so that we could compare that to our own children\u2019s past development, and look ahead to how far she progressed, thinking that the potential was there for our kids. Of course, there are no guarantees, and we know that. But still. We hope.\nIf you ever have the opportunity to attend a seminar where an autistic adult will be presenting, I encourage you to do so. You will come away with a sense of understanding that you couldn\u2019t possibly get from reading a book. You can\u2019t look at that person and think, That\u2019s what my kid could be like. But looking at them and just experiencing their presence will give you hope.

{"date": "January 13, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nNigel: \u00a0Mom, isn\u2019t it strange? I love pumpkin pie but I don\u2019t like pumpkin.\nSo often I take for granted my understanding of all the nuances of our culture, including aspects of our spoken communication. I know when someone is making a joke or being sarcastic, I know that sometimes when I make a brief comment or ask a rhetorical question that I usually won\u2019t get a response, and I know that most people with typical hearing only use subtitles when watching foreign films.\nMy son\u2019s autistic mind usually takes nothing for granted and makes no assumptions. If he makes a statement such as \u201cThis mixes my face\u201d while looking into a disco ball, he will repeat the statement until someone acknowledges him. He does not take for granted that I\u2019ve heard him, that I don\u2019t know that he is expecting a response, or that I don\u2019t have one for him. He doesn\u2019t understand why no one is responding to him, so he repeats himself. He doesn\u2019t mind repeating himself five times while I am formulating a response, especially when his statement is something as, um, unusual as \u201cMy brain is the size of twenty yellow lemons,\u201d which he said at age eight. I had no idea where that came from.\nThat was also the year that he discovered that DVDs were better than VHS tapes because he could choose to watch them with subtitles so that he could keep the volume low and memorize the lines while reading them onscreen. One night, when I started watching a movie (without using subtitles), he asked, \u201cWhy you didn\u2019t want it without words?\u201d because he couldn\u2019t imagine how I could deprive myself of this convenience. Growing out of clothing was also a difficult concept that year. When his briefs were getting too tighty-whitey and I had to purchase new ones, I forgot that I should have prepared him. He went to get dressed the next morning and stood there in front of his chest of drawers saying, \u201cWhat about the 6 underwear?\u201d since I had bought him size 8, and his old ones had been size 6. No assumptions.\nFast forward six years, and he is starting to make little assumptions. He realizes that just because he likes pumpkin pie, it doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s going to like pumpkin. (I assure him that many people fall into that category.) And he is learning to recognize sarcasm. A few weeks ago, a friend of the family was visiting on a day that Nigel was supposed to have cleaned his room. Since he hadn\u2019t cleaned it, it looked like a bomb had gone off in there. Nigel was sitting on his bed reading when my friend poked his head in the doorway, surveyed the damage, and said, \u201cIt looks good in here.\u201d\nNigel paused for a moment as if considering, and then he said, \u201cI know you\u2019re being sarcastic.\u201d\nIn spite of the messy room, I was rather proud. And definitely amused.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/01/13/nuance/", "title": "Nuance"},

It is late afternoon, and there is still frost from this morning on all of the vegetation in our neighborhood. Baby, it\u2019s cold outside. Cold and dry.\nI climb down from the ladder, put it away, and plug in the lights. Then I step back a bit to view my handiwork. Hmm. Strange how those eight bulbs worked just fine when I tested the lights forty-five minutes earlier, before stringing them up. Oh, for crying out loud. Sometimes I wonder why I bother.\nI run in the house and wash up, calling out to Nigel to see if he\u2019s ready to go. Every Sunday afternoon for the past several weeks, we\u2019ve volunteered at our local animal shelter as part of a community service requirement for his next level of Boy Scouts. The animal shelter welcomes under-18 volunteers as long as their parents accompany them. And so, we both go.\nInitially, I resisted this time taken out of my much-needed and usually full weekends. How could we \u2013 I \u2013 possibly fit it yet another activity? How could I possibly get everything done? When was I going to squeeze in some down time? I already volunteer for the Autism Society of Oregon and various other Scout activities. Furthermore, we have pets at home to take care of! I didn\u2019t have time to volunteer to take care of more animals! I did realize, of course, that this was the perfect opportunity for Nigel to get in his community service time for Scouts. The animal shelter is only a five-minute drive away, and Nigel loves animals. I decided to grin and bear it.\nWe get in the car and drive to the shelter. I laid down the law before we even started there four weeks ago: no new pets. No matter how cute they are, no matter how much you love them, no matter how long they\u2019ve been at the shelter. Nigel had agreed. But after a month of being surrounded by cute kitties in need, Nigel starts saying things like, \u201cI wish we could afford to take you home with us\u201d when he\u2019s holding a cat and I\u2019m in earshot. I remind him of his irritation with cleaning the cat litter for the cats that we already have. He considers this a moment.\n\u201cI know!\u201d Nigel exclaims. \u201cI want to start my own animal shelter! That way, I can have lots of cats and have employees and volunteers to help take care of them.\u201d\n\u00a0So. We\u2019ll just add that to the list of potential careers for my son, right up there with inventor and astronaut. \u00a0But then I realize that he\u2019s absolutely right. He loves animals and wants to help those in need. And that\u2019s exactly what he told me when I asked him why he wanted to start an animal shelter. I said that we could certainly look into it.\nMeanwhile, my grin-and-bear-it time has turned out differently than I thought it would. I find that while I\u2019m holding and petting the adult cats and playing with the kittens, I\u2019m not thinking about anything else. I\u2019m not stressing about the things that I\u2019m not getting done and the time that I\u2019m losing. I know! Can you believe it?! I just sit there and relax! There\u2019s no computer, no phone, no calendar, no errands. It\u2019s actually just what I needed.\nThe hour passes quickly, and we sign out and go home. When we pull up to the house, Nigel comments in a dry tone, \u201cIt seems like some bulbs aren\u2019t working.\u201d\nAnd the best part is that it doesn\u2019t even bother me.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/12/06/the-lights-are-on/", "title": "The Lights Are On"},
{"date": "September 8, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tAnd so, high school begins.\nInspired by my good friend Mama Edge, I prepared an information sheet about Nigel to give to all of his teachers. Why, with all the proactive things I do to ensure my son\u2019s success, had I not thought of this before?! It\u2019s such a basic, fundamental thing to do! Imagine how much better things might have gone in middle school had I thought of this then! *slaps forehead*\nAlas, the idea had not graced me with its presence. I muddled through somehow. But I am happy to report that I am now on track, and this afternoon I presented all of Nigel\u2019s teachers with an information sheet listing his background, his strengths and weaknesses, descriptions of his mannerisms and behavior, and tips for helping him to learn and function at his best. The teachers seemed interested and appreciative. Not all were there, but I brought extras to be given later to those who were unable to attend the meeting. The regional autism consultant, who had shadowed Nigel on his first day today, said that he seemed to do pretty well.\nBut afterward, as I walked through the halls on my way out to my car, the nagging doubt returned. The anxiety. I saw a wall display in one hallway that Nigel and I had walked through last week. The school mascot is the pirate, and the display cabinet held student artwork in it. Across the top of the display, in large letters, was written \u201cPirate allery.\u201d Nigel laughed and pointed at it, saying in a loud voice, \u201c\u2018Pirate allery!\u2018 The G is missing! Ha!\u201d Then he laughed some more. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, smiling. I continued in a quiet voice, trying to get him to tone down his loudness, \u201cThat\u2019s funny.\u201d\nAnd really, it was pretty funny. But in that moment he reminded me of the fact that he has the emotional age of a 9- or 10-year-old. It\u2019s not new to me, but sometimes it just hits me. And I\u2019m mainstreaming him in high school. It\u2019s like sending a 9- or 10-year-old to high school. *sigh* I walked out to my car, drained (this is the third time in a week that I\u2019ve had to leave work early to go to the high school for a meeting), wanting to be hopeful, but so, so worried. So resigned to the reality, the uphill nature of parenting a child with autism, the constant wondering if I am doing enough. I have been at both ends of the spectrum with my son, and both are difficult. Some things were harder then, and some things are harder now. But if it\u2019s hard on me, how must it be for him?\nAt least the high school support systems are now in place. In addition to the information sheets I gave to the teachers, I submitted a stack of print-outs of my post \u201cGetting to Know an Autistic Teen\u201d for Nigel\u2019s peer advisory group, twenty kids he will be with all year long, some in other grades. The advisory teacher will give them out to the group sometime in the next few days. I said a quick prayer as I crossed the threshold of the school, hoping that this disclosure will lead to acceptance.\nI got in my car and started it. Tired, lost in thought, I reminded myself that I needed to stop at the post office. As I pulled away from the curb, the car stereo came on automatically. And there it was \u2013 already. A response to my brief subconscious prayer. \u201cDon\u2019t worry . . . about a thing . . . \u2018cause every little thing . . . gonna be all right.\u201d I sucked in my breath, overcome with emotion. I didn\u2019t remember that I had Bob in there. But that song, those words \u2013 right at the moment that I needed them. Such a gift.\nThank you, I said, relief washing over me.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mamaedge.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/09/08/enough/", "title": "Enough"},
{"date": "April 16, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tLittle transitions \u2013 stopping an activity to come to dinner, getting into and out of the shower, a new piece of furniture \u2013 can be challenging enough to get through. And they make the big transitions \u2013 starting a new school, moving, divorce \u2013 seem incredibly daunting. And we have a really big one coming up.\nBrace yourselves.\nIn September, Nigel starts high school. Wait \u2013 did I just write that? A mere five days ago, as I held my newborn nephew in my arms, I remembered seeing my son for the first time. Holding him, gazing at his sweet little face. How is it possible that the sweet little face now has peach fuzz on it and towers over me?\u00a0 How is it possible that the five-year-old who could not say his name when asked is now pre-registering for a full day of unassisted classes at the high school?\nI am, of course, filled with apprehension. But part of me is also hopeful. Two nights ago Nigel and I attended the \u201c8th Grade Pre-Registration Night\u201d at the high school. We ran into a good friend of his, and our families sat together. The principal gave a PowerPoint presentation and spoke about all the positive attributes of the school, including a student support system called an Advisory. It is comprised of twenty students, five from each grade level, and all students in the school are part of one. They meet weekly to discuss both academic and social issues. While this sounded very positive to me, Nigel was more excited about the opportunity to start his own club.\nAfter the principal\u2019s presentation, the audience split up into smaller groups to take teacher-led tours of the school. We had barely gotten started on the tour when Nigel flagged down our tour leader, the vice principal, and mentioned that he wanted to start a club for stop-motion Lego films. Only he asked it in his halting, \u201cI-have-something-to-ask-but-my-autism-makes-me-pause-and-say-hmm-a-lot-when-I\u2019m-nervous-or-not-sure-what-to-say\u201d voice. The vice principal, who had just returned from coaching a softball game, got a blank look on his face for a few seconds, trying to piece together what Nigel had tried to say. I almost stepped in with a quiet \u201cMy son has autism\u201d explanation. I\u2019ve done that in the past whenever someone new to us has a hard time understanding Nigel. But something made me hold back this time. In the past year, I\u2019ve tried to hold back whenever I feel that Nigel\u2019s doing okay interacting on his own with someone who doesn\u2019t know him. It may not be perfect, but he manages. I have to realize that I\u2019m not always going to be there, especially at high school, to step in and wave the autism flag. There\u2019s something liberating in the \u201cnot telling.\u201d Because, really, a person\u2019s response should not be influenced by knowing if someone\u2019s autistic. Ideally, a person should respond with patience and respect regardless. They should realize that the person addressing them seems to have some difficulty expressing themselves \u2013 the reason why shouldn\u2019t matter. And sometimes, after the quick blank look, the other person gets it. They may not know exactly what \u201cit\u201d is, but they know that they\u2019re in the presence of someone who communicates differently, and that\u2019s okay. I took a deep breath and waited for the vice principal\u2019s response.\nHe got it. He gently rephrased what Nigel had said in a questioning tone to see if he was correct. Nigel confirmed with an appropriate \u201cyeah,\u201d and the\u00a0vice principal\u00a0said, \u201cYou certainly can start your own club. There\u2019s a sheet in the pre-registration packet that tells you how to do it. That was a great question!\u201d Then he turned and resumed leading the tour.\nI exhaled and put my arm around my son as we followed the group. I wanted to high-five the vice principal and tell him that he had just made an autistic teen feel very good about himself. And that he had just made the autistic teen\u2019s parent feel a little better about such a big transition.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/04/16/stepping-back/", "title": "Stepping Back"},

We boldly eat what no one has eaten before. In this house, neither child has ever requested the typically well-loved staple, macaroni and cheese, for dinner. But a pizza smoothie? Bring it on.\n\nI try to explain to Nigel that texture has quite a bit to do with why we like certain foods. Take away the texture, and that changes how we respond to a food. Appearance counts for a lot, too.

How may I assist you today?\nTanya: I have downloaded the unaccompanied minor form for my two children, ages 13 and 15. My question is if the meeting party needs to sign where it says \u201csignature of Party Accepting Custody\u201d when they actually pick up the children, or does it need to be signed by the meeting party beforehand? Thanks.\nMicki: 13 and 15 year olds traveling together are not considered unaccompanied minors. The 15 year old is considered an adult.\nTanya: My 15-year-old has autism, and their father still needs to go directly to the gate to pick them up.\nMicki: [no response]\nTanya: He\u2019ll be fine on the plane, but we don\u2019t want him going through the airport unaccompanied.\nMicki: That is fine. We will document the itinerary so that it\u2019s understood by the agents. All the father needs to do is show his identification at the ticket counter and they will issue him a gate pass to meet the flight.\nThose who happened to catch my post a few days ago know what transpired with the December 25th travel plans, and why the flight had to be scheduled that day. But since we had no way of knowing that it would be canceled, the boys were prepped for their first solo flight (!). We practiced lifting up their luggage to put it in the overhead bins. We talked about being patient while waiting to de-plane and not making comments about how people should \u201cjust move.\u201d We talked about what to do if for some reason their father wasn\u2019t at the gate when they landed. We went over what topics are not okay to talk about with airport security. Special needs were noted with the airline agent in an online chat that could be printed out for verification. Not surprisingly, there were many preparations for this huge milestone.\nAnd although they ended up not flying that day, we still planned to have them return to Oregon by plane. \u00a0I got up\u00a0that\u00a0morning and\u00a0prayed for a fogless arrival time, so that the boys\u2019 plane could land safely. Their father called to let me know as soon as they boarded in LA. He sounded so proud, describing how he watched the boys get on the plane, and how they waited patiently for an elderly woman in front of them.\nWhen the time came, I drove to our little airport to pick them up. The sky looked good, but as I neared the terminal, my body started gasping involuntarily. It wasn\u2019t a panic attack, which I\u2019ve had in the past. No, it was just a mom, overcome with emotion. I couldn\u2019t help it. Nigel was doing something I never thought he\u2019d be able to do! He has come so far, and he never ceases to amaze me.\nI parked the car and pulled myself together. I went to the counter to request a gate pass. They hemmed and hawed a bit at first (I wanted to say, So what if they\u2019re teenagers? They are my children, autistic or not, and I have every right to meet them at the gate!), but all I had to do was drop the A-word, and then they were accommodating. The flight was only a few minutes late, and I waited anxiously at the gate.\nI was afraid that I would start crying again with their arrival, but as soon as I saw them, my face broke into a huge grin! Aidan ran past me, looking unwell. \u201cMom, I\u2019m sick. I\u2019m going to the bathroom,\u201d he said as he handed me his luggage and took off. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I called after him, but he hurried away. I hugged Nigel and asked him what was wrong with Aidan. He said he didn\u2019t know, and we walked over to the side to wait for him. Nigel said that the flight was fine, and then he proceeded to tell me about how, at the movie theater the night before, he threw up twice during the 3-D showing of Avatar. \u201cThat 3-D was too good, I guess!\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that happened, honey,\u201d I said. He told me that all the 3-D aerial scenes made him dizzy and sick. I hadn\u2019t even thought of that as a movie-related sensory issue. If it\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s another!\nAidan returned then, explaining that he\u2019d felt a little airsick when they started descending, and then the stuffiness of the cabin and having so many people around him while waiting to de-plane just got to him. \u201cAt least I didn\u2019t throw up in the plane,\u201d he said. Yes, at least. Oh, my poor SPD boys! I felt so bad that they had both been sick, especially when I\u2019d hoped that they would enjoy the movie, and later, take pride in their autonomy on the flight. But my concern took a back seat to my overall relief and exhilaration. They did it! Their first solo flight!

What ho!\u2019\nAfter that it seemed rather difficult to go on with the conversation.\n-P.G. Wodehouse, My Man Jeeves (1919) \u2018Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest\u2019\nYesterday, Aidan\u2019s best friend of seven years was visiting at our house. In the spring, he moved three and a half hours away, so the boys don\u2019t get to see each other very often. They talk a lot on the phone, but Aidan always looks forward to getting to spend some time with his friend when he\u2019s in town. And yesterday, spur of the moment, he called right as Aidan was getting home from school. \u201cI\u2019m in town visiting my dad,\u201d K said to me on the phone. \u201cIs it okay if I come over for a bit?\u201d\nSo Aidan and K had a blast hanging out and playing video games together. I threw in a pizza for dinner and called all three boys out to the table when it was ready. Nigel came out last, fresh off a movie in his room. He knew that K was visiting and greeted him as he sat down. I sat about fifteen feet away in the living room, reading.\nThey had barely taken two bites, presumably, when Nigel launched into some lengthy delayed echolalia. (Technically, these days it\u2019s called \u2018scripting,\u2019 but ten years ago, when it was his primary means of communication, we didn\u2019t have that terminology yet. Or at least I didn\u2019t. His therapists called it \u2018delayed echolalia,\u2019 a term which has stuck with me.) I had no idea what was going on with him. He kept going on, rapidly reciting something in a strange tone of voice. Aidan and I, glancing at each other, were stunned\u00a0by this monologue. Nigel often still says single lines from movies, or a couple lines of dialogue run together, but nothing this lengthy. Poor K was trying to nicely respond, to acknowledge Nigel and converse with him. He\u2019s been at our house so many times over the years that he\u2019s quite used to Nigel\u2019s different way of communicating, but he wasn\u2019t sure what to make of this. I decided to gently intervene.\n\u201cNigel? What are you saying? You need to use your own words, okay?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just making polite conversation!\u201d he shot back. I\u2019d be willing to bet money that this was also a line from something, just by the way he said it.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re having a conversation, it\u2019s best to use your own words so that people know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to say things from movies,\u201d Aidan added gently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not from a movie! It\u2019s from a book! Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland!\u201d he growled.\n\u201cOkay, well, how about if you just eat now?\u201d I suggested. I really didn\u2019t know what else to say. I knew he\u2019d been reading that book (the original) for several weeks, but I had no idea he\u2019d been memorizing it. And why the sudden inappropriate monologue? He\u2019s done much shorter versions (of delayed echolalia) in the past when we\u2019ve had multiple people at our house, or in unfamiliar situations, but I couldn\u2019t figure out why he needed to do it last night. Was it a sign of a mini-regression? A conversational test on someone familiar? What gives?\nI gave it a lot of thought, and then it hit me. It\u2019s because he\u2019s autistic, of course. His language development was extremely late and labored. The art of conversation is something that may always be out of his reach. Yes, he can communicate. At this point in his life, he usually does it fairly well. But communicating and conversing are two different skills, and the skill of conversing is something with which he will most likely continue to struggle.\nWe\u00a0often say, \u201cTwo steps forward, one step back,\u201d or a variation thereof. \u00a0I could choose to look at last night\u2019s conversation attempt as a step back. But in reality I think it was sort of a side step, a lateral move. He was testing the waters. In fact, I talked to him about it later when we were alone, and he confirmed my theory.\n\u201cI just wanted to try something new. I thought it would be fun. K seemed to handle it fine.\u201d\n\u201cYes. That\u2019s because he knows you really well. But it\u2019s probably not a good idea to do that with people who don\u2019t know you very well, because they won\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cI just don\u2019t feel like I could give it up.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give it up. Just try to only do it around people who know you well. Okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nI think maybe it was a step forward after all.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/12/08/polite-conversation/", "title": "Polite Conversation"},
{"date": "March 7, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nEver since the movie Adam came out on DVD, I\u2019ve debated watching it. I was curious but skeptical. I wondered how realistic it could be, or how stereotypical, how formulaic, or how Hollywoodized. I feared that it might be contrived, either an Apergerized, Rainman-esque \u201cautistic-people-are-savants\u201d portrayal, or a glossy \u201cpeople-with-Asperger\u2019s-are-quirky-but-they\u2019re-just-like-everyone-else\u201d feel-good portrayal. And, having watched it last night, I must say that there were a few implausible things I noted, but I could have been wrong about them. After all, Nigel does not have Asperger\u2019s. Some areas of his development have differed from the characteristics of AS. But these days, there are plenty of similarities.\nIn any case, this is not a review of Adam. This is a post about what happened when I decided to watch it. With Nigel. Yes, I took a leap. I\u2019ve been taking a lot of them lately, trusting that I\u2019m doing the right thing. When I rented it, it was with the intention of watching it alone, but given Nigel\u2019s interest in relationships, I thought it might be good for him to see the film, and then we could discuss it and how it relates to him.\nAnd discuss it we did. My son said so many profound things that I was constantly choking on my emotional reactions, trying not to let him see how his words affected me. With the movie, he took it all in. At times, such as when the two main characters were in bed together, he would avert his eyes, and I told him that it was a PG-13 movie, and I didn\u2019t think we needed to be concerned about things going too far on film. Nigel said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that. I\u2019m just afraid that he\u2019s going to do or say the wrong thing and mess it up.\u201d And I died inside, thinking of all the times in my son\u2019s everyday life that he must feel that way about himself.\nNigel noticed what difficulty Adam had in a restaurant, and that prompted a discussion about Nigel\u2019s own sensory issues. He remembered how hard it was for him to go into public restrooms because of the air hand driers. \u201cThey were like screaming banshees,\u201d he said. And I pointed out that he learned how to filter that sound. \u201cYeah. They\u2019re still loud, but I can handle them. It seems like Adam couldn\u2019t handle the sounds in the restaurant,\u201d Nigel said, and I could hear some self-confidence (or was it relief?) in his voice that he had progressed to a point where he could handle being in a restaurant. And, Nigel was quick to point out, he\u2019s an extrovert who wants to do social things, whereas Adam is definitely an introvert and experiences much anxiety about doing those things. Nigel may share the lack of social skills, but at least he is motivated to be social, and this made him feel good about himself. He also commented on a scene in which Adam becomes angry and does not deal with it well, raising his voice and throwing things. Nigel said that sometimes anger feels like \u201ca nuclear bomb going off\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s so hard to control it.\u201d But he also realized that he is learning to control it, and that, at fifteen, he is doing a better job of it than Adam.\nA couple of areas really seemed to hit home with Nigel. One was the focused talking about \u201cspecialist subjects.\u201d For Adam, it was telescope facts and local theater history. For Nigel, it\u2019s a range of all his favorite movies, military history, and his favorite authors (Jules Verne and H.G. Wells). In this area, he is much like Adam\u2014not realizing when he\u2019s going on too long or noticing that he\u2019s monologuing and the person is bored. Nigel believes that he\u2019s got this area under control because, in his social skills class, he\u2019s learned to ask the person if he should continue talking about something. \u201cAnd if they say \u2018yes,\u2019 I do.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t have the awareness to realize when he\u2019s been talking too long and the other person is just being polite.\nAlso, Nigel totally identified with the big picture social issues. \u201cNormal people usually don\u2019t get different people,\u201d he\u2019d say. Of course, many times I\u2019ve said to him that different people are normal too, but that doesn\u2019t seem to make sense to him. However, toward the end of the movie, he did say, \u201cEventually, people learn to understand people like . . . us.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure if he hesitated because he was trying to remember Adam\u2019s name, or if he was processing the fact that he identified with him. It\u2019s been very hard for him in the past, although recently he\u2019s felt better about it.\nOverall, I\u2019m glad I watched Adam with Nigel. It\u2019s true that seeing some of the behavior on film was hard for him, but I think that makes him more aware of it. If he knows what the challenges are, he can face them armed with that knowledge. In addition to that, seeing this movie prompted a discussion about the importance of jobs, and that if you get tired of doing your job after just two hours, you can\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019m done\u201d and then leave. \u201cI have to stay at the job so that I get the paycheck and can support myself,\u201d Nigel said. Halle-freakin-luiah! This understanding is a long time in coming. A long time. For years, he\u2019d say that when he grew up he wanted to be an inventor of time machines and didn\u2019t want to do any other job because it would bore him. I would suggest to him that he might need to do another job while he was inventing the time machine so that he would have money to pay for his food, etc.,\u00a0and this concept was completely lost on him. I don\u2019t know what it was about watching Adam that changed his thinking, but it did, and I\u2019m very glad. I think both of us are a little more optimistic about his future now. And that\u2019s saying a lot about a movie I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to see in the first place.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/03/07/watching-adam/", "title": "Watching Adam"},

As an introvert, I don\u2019t get too excited when the phone rings anyway. But when Nigel\u2019s not home and the phone rings, I get nervous.\nThis afternoon, Nigel wanted to ride his bike to a neighborhood kid\u2019s house a couple of blocks away, so I said sure, just be careful and be home by five. Less than 45 minutes later, the\u00a0phone rang and it was the elementary school about half a mile away. Apparently the\u00a0kid\u00a0he went to visit wanted to hang out at the school, so Nigel went with him, and then he proceeded to get into an argument with the kids in the after-school club there.\u00a0One of the girls said something that upset Nigel, and\u00a0things escalated to the point where Nigel was so agitated that he threatened her\u00a0by saying he would tear her arms and legs off, after she had called him a second-grader.\u00a0I\u00a0told the school\u00a0I\u2019d be there in five minutes.\nIf I had a dollar for every time all the\u00a0schools over the years called me about Nigel\u2019s disruptive behavior, I could certainly pay for a much-needed massage for myself. You would think after all these years that I would\u00a0be used to it, that it wouldn\u2019t rattle me the way that it does. But every time it happens I feel like I have a brick in my gut and a sense of hopelessness floods my veins. I\u2019m so tired of it. I\u2019m so tired of having to apologize and explain my son\u2019s behavior to someone and wondering if it will ever change.\nBut this time was different. This time Nigel apologized, and without prompting. To the adult moderator of the club he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have autism and sometimes I can\u2019t control my anger.\u201d And then, on his own, he went and apologized to the girl, told her that what she said had upset him, and she apologized to him. It was like something out of a movie. Something I wouldn\u2019t have dared to dream of.\nAnd the brick was gone and I thought, Wow, he\u2019s actually starting to get it. Then we went home and I talked with him about what had happened, and how proud I was of him that he had apologized. He still needs to do a lot of work in the area of letting go of an argument and the feeling that he has to \u201cget back at someone\u201d when they upset him, and remembering that it\u2019s never okay to threaten people. And I know I have to prepare myself for many more confrontations and ensuing phone calls. But we made progress today. Development is always slow, but it\u2019s there.

A notable contributing factor, in some cases.\nNigel\u2019s last \u201cbooster\u201d vaccinations were seven years ago.\u00a0In 2001, I don\u2019t think I had heard of thimerosol. I think at that point, thimerosol had not been isolated as\u00a0a possible\u00a0culprit. There were groups of so-called fanatical parents who supposedly believed that the vaccines themselves caused autism. And I didn\u2019t think that the vaccines themselves were to blame. So I agreed to the three boosters (did I have a choice, school district?) and unwittingly injected\u00a0my son\u00a0with more mercury.\nAnd\u00a0now that the thimerosol-laced vaccines are no longer being produced, I should feel fine about continuing to inoculate my son, right? On paper, I do feel okay. But something nags at me. Something makes me feel like I should avoid the vaccines. It\u2019s just a little feeling. I wish I didn\u2019t feel it, because I think at this point it\u2019s irrational. It\u2019s this \u201chere we go again\u201d feeling, a deja vu feeling, an I-know-better-now feeling. And I will shelve it, because I believe it when they tell me that thimerosol is no longer being used in children\u2019s vaccines. Maybe I just want to believe it. But I sure as hell hope it\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s the least we deserve.\nVaccinations are never a pleasant experience but are essential when dealing with certain diseases, especially if traveling abroad.

{"date": "April 15, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tFor many years I could not say that\u00a0Nigel was autistic. I could not say, \u201cMy son is autistic.\u201d I would readily tell people \u201cMy son has autism,\u201d because to me that was different than calling him autistic. The autism, I accepted. To me, saying someone \u201chas autism\u201d puts the focus on the person\u00a0rather than the disability. Saying\u00a0my son \u201cis autistic\u201d makes it sound like the autism is\u00a0his identity.\nBut it is. It\u2019s part of\u00a0his identity.\nIt took me so long to realize that and accept it. I used to tell friends and family, \u201cWe say that Nigel HAS autism rather than he IS autistic, just like you say that someone HAS Down syndrome rather than someone is \u2018Down syndromic.'\u201d I\u2019m sure I sounded like I was stuck in some level of denial. I was willing to admit that my son had a disability, but not acknowledge that\u00a0it was actually part of his personality.\u00a0\nI\u2019m not sure what changed. Maybe it was a subconscious need to\u00a0fully process the\u00a0way autism\u00a0affected our family. About two years ago, I started saying, \u201cMy son is autistic\u201d when\u00a0mentioning him to strangers or acquaintances. And I was surprised to find that I actually felt comfortable saying it. Sometimes I would say it by myself, quietly, in my room. I would hear the words coming out of my mouth, and with them came\u00a0a sense of something that resembled peace. Autism didn\u2019t feel as much like this formidable disability when I used that different terminology, the one I had resisted for many years. The word I had told other people not to use: autistic. It was almost a relief that now I could actually say it: My son is autistic! I realized that I had finally truly accepted the autism present in our lives because I embraced it as part of my son\u2019s identity, not just something that he \u201chas.\u201d\nMy realization was further supported by an interview I recently came across at Natural Learning Concepts, featuring Daniel Hawthorne, a high-functioning autistic adult who was non-verbal until the age of seven. Here is his response to the issue of having autism vs. being autistic:\n\nDo you get upset if you\u2019re called \u201cautistic\u201d rather than \u201ca person with autism?\u201d \n\u201cActually, I prefer to think of myself as being autistic rather than having autism. Autism is pervasive; it affects every facet of my life.\u00a0 It is not just something I have in the sense that one may have diabetes or epilepsy.\u00a0 Autism affects the way I think, my personality, my abilities and much more, and I accept it.\u201d\n\nI have come to feel the same way about Nigel. I never thought of autism as a\u00a0disease (like diabetes or epilepsy mentioned above), but I seemed to think I could\u00a0refer to\u00a0it as such, in saying it was something Nigel \u201chad.\u201d I have finally come to terms with the fact that it\u2019s part of who he is. And whether he is able to achieve the high level of functioning that Daniel Hawthorne has, or if he stays the same, or even if he regresses, Nigel will always be the amazing person that he is \u2013\u00a0my autistic son.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://nlconcepts.com/autism-hawthorne.htm?a_aid=6868cef2"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/04/15/having-autism-vs-being-autistic/", "title": "Having Autism Vs.

Not so much because if I messed up, I could start over, but because I could adjust my drawing as I went along. If I started at the top and worked my way down, I could lift up the film a little bit to make changes. Nothing was set in stone.\nAnd so it is with behavioral medication. If a certain type isn\u2019t working, you can try another one. If the dose doesn\u2019t seem right, you can increase or decrease it. And when you think you\u2019ve reached a point where it\u2019s no longer necessary, you can stop taking it. Or, you can ask your mom for six months until she agrees.\nNigel had an appointment with his psychiatrist on Friday afternoon. As we often do in that office, we waited for quite some time before she opened the door to the waiting area. And then she called in someone else whose appointment, we learned, had been scheduled forty-five minutes before ours. I looked at the doctor, and she suggested that we reschedule, which I got up to do. I was shocked to find that she had an opening just a few days later, and we took it.\nWe got back in the car to leave, and Nigel began his negotiating process. He\u2019s been doing this with me since at least October \u2013 telling me that he wants to stop taking the medication, that he doesn\u2019t think he needs it anymore. And I respond the same way, telling him that he feels this way because the medication is working. But this time was different. This time I thought about the fact that he has been on Risperidone for fourteen months, and in the last twelve months, we have not increased his very low dosage. During that time, his height has increased by five inches (!), and his weight accordingly. At this point, the medication is probably having minimal effect. And even though it helped him when he really needed it, I\u2019ve never felt comfortable with him having it in his body, and I\u2019ve looked forward to the time when he could discontinue taking it.\nAnd I think that the time has come. He has enough medication left to gradually wean himself off of it for the next three weeks. Half of that time is Spring Break, so it will be a low-stress time for a transition. And we\u2019ll be checking in with his doctor tomorrow to confirm our plans. \u00a0\nWhat\u2019s comforting is knowing that, as with my childhood toy, we can always start over. If it turns out that we were a bit premature and that Nigel still needs the Risperidone to help regulate his behavior, we can always have him start taking it again. But we wouldn\u2019t know unless we tried, so we\u2019re going for it. He thinks he\u2019s ready, and now, so do I. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Century-Novelty-Easter-Magic-Slate/dp/B0030E5R3S/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=toys-and-games&qid=1268596167&sr=1-2"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/03/14/re-evaluating/", "title": "Re-Evaluating"},

Sometimes it is circumstantial: I am experiencing major changes\u00a0in some\u00a0other area of my life, and my hairstyle change is symbolic of that. At other times it\u2019s because my hair is down to my lower back, and it\u2019s just too much work at that length! Off with it!\nLast week my hair was reaching beyond the middle of my back, the sun was out, and I had it cut. I think this time it was as much because it was too long as it was a metaphor for the changes going on in my life.\u00a0I came to the realization a few months ago that Nigel can no longer be mainstreamed, as he was (with an extensive support system) for\u00a0four years. I radically altered my life, my schedule, my finances, and my ideas so that I could wrap my mind around the concept of homeschooling him, and found ways to make it happen. (I plan to write about that subject in detail for a future post.) And now I am doing it. I drastically cut back on my hours in the office at my job, I found some work I can do from home, and I am now my son\u2019s teacher.\nIt was a huge change, and I am still reeling from it, even though it is positive. It is scary financially, since I am a single parent. And it comes with so many other adjustments that must be made: emotional, physical, social. So when I\u2019m at the hair salon, and the other patrons and stylists who witness my middle-of-the-back hair being cut into a chin-length shattered bob comment on how brave I am to do that, I say It\u2019s only hair. \nGetting my hair cut short doesn\u2019t make me brave. Being a single parent? Sometimes brave. Raising a child with autism? Usually. Homeschooling my autistic son while being a single parent? Reducing my work hours from 30 hours a week to 6, thus reducing my income?\nAnd then I think of Nigel, trying to navigate middle school without any support system in place (how could I have let the IEP \u2018team\u2019 convince me that he would be fine with that?!) and dealing with the constant harassment and bullying he experienced, just trying to get through his day, pulling out his hair because of the eternal state of anxiety he was in, and I know. He is the brave one. He was brave to make that first leap to try to learn to talk by repeating lines from videos, trying to fit the lines within the context of the real situation. He was brave to learn how to filter all the mechanical sounds that were agonizing to him. He was brave to want to take the regular school bus, because he wanted \u201cto be like everybody else.\u201d That\u2019s all he wanted, and they treated him so terribly. Yet he went back, every day, and he always tried so hard.\u00a0Finally, he reached his limit, and he begged me to homeschool him. That was brave too.\nMaybe the little things like getting\u00a0my hair cut short are brave. But when you live with autism, it puts a different perspective on things. And it makes you define bravery in a whole new way.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/03/16/bravery/", "title": "Bravery"},

And\u00a0the possibility\u00a0has filled me with\u00a0fear.\nTwo years ago, one of my co-workers was running some errands on her lunch break, and she had a seizure while she was backing her car out of her space in a busy parking lot. No one was hurt and there were people around who helped her, but it got me thinking and worrying. What if Nigel had a seizure while riding his bike? Just in the past few months I have become secure enough to let him ride his bike alone around the neighborhood. He craves some independence, and so I hold my breath while he is gone for half an hour, hoping he\u2019ll watch for cars, remember to stop at corners, not run into anyone or anything. Not have a seizure. It\u2019s hard to completely let go like that and just trust.\nWhen my co-worker returned to work the next day, my boss made\u00a0sure that all of us were informed about what to do if a seizure occured in the office (the co-worker had not previously disclosed that she was epileptic). We learned to not restrain her, and to remove any sharp objects in the area. Afterward, we should lay her on her side to maintain an open airway and prevent inhaling any secretions. We learned that she may experience confusion and that someone should stay with her.\nAccording to Autismuk.com, Roughly 25-30% of autistic adolescents have been reported to develop seizures. That\u2019s too high a percentage for my comfort level. But I guess if Nigel did start having seizures we would just deal with it. We\u2019d do what we needed to do, just like we\u2019ve done all along with every other issue that\u2019s come up.\nAnd I would do what I\u2019m doing now: solicit\u00a0advice from those who\u2019ve been through it. Are there any readers whose children developed seizures in adolescence? Do your children take any medication for it? Please contribute your experience and suggestions.

{"date": "March 19, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tMost individuals on the spectrum have what\u00a0many call \u201cspecialist subjects.\u201d These are topics of on-going interest, over long periods of time, that sometimes increase in intensity for various reasons and then abate for a while, but never go away. They usually cover a general area, such as dinosaurs, computers, video games, or in Nigel\u2019s case, natural disasters. He has been interested in natural disasters since he was six years old and I allowed him to watch the movie Twister, which fascinated rather than scared him. Ever since then, he gravitates toward those types of movies and books, and he has expanded the topic to include \u201cunnatural\u201d disasters, such as the sinking of the Titanic. But sometimes these side interests turn into what I call the Obsession of the Week. They hit like a tornado, consume everything, and then they die down.\nObsessions of the Week literally consume him. He can think of nothing else, he does extensive internet searches on the topic, he can talk of nothing else, and I\u2019m sure he lies awake into the wee hours imagining himself immersed in the topic. It is an obsession. His past Obsessions of the Week include Indiana Jones (Nigel became a Boy Scout because Indiana Jones was one), going to Mexico with his classmate\u2019s family (somehow he thought it would be okay for him to go with them on a family trip), running his own Jurassic Park (because of the movie, he believes\u00a0that dino DNA can be\u00a0extracted and used to\u00a0breed dinosaurs), \u00a0and taking four fellow Boy Scouts on an Oregon Trail trip, starting in Independence, MO, where they will purchase oxen, supplies, and materials to build a wagon.\nI have often wondered where these obsessions come from and how he can become so caught up in them. What purpose do they serve? Is it because now that his imagination is functioning that he\u2019s making up for lost time? Is it because he had to learn to filter out the things that plagued him that he learned to put\u00a0intense focus on the things that bring him joy? I\u2019m not sure. I do know that even with the problems associated with his obsessions (difficulty transitioning from an obsession-based activity to a non-obsession-based activity, difficulty communicating with him when in obsession-mode, concern about him not getting enough sleep), I still welcome them for several reasons. They motivate him. They encourage self-esteem. They keep him productively occupied. They inspire him. They educate him. They give him something to talk about. All of these things are so important for an autistic teen.\nThe Obsession of the Week last week was King Kong. We had to rent all versions and sequels of the movies and checked out a book at the library on King Kong cinematography. He put in a request for a King Kong stuffed animal. He watched King Kong-related YouTube videos. He built King Kong scenes out of Lego. He perfected primate chest-beating.\nAnd now we are into a new week. His father, who lives 700 miles away,\u00a0is visiting, as he does several times a year, so Nigel is happily focused on spending time with him. They are bowling right now. The only problem is that his dad brought his really cute black cocker spaniel puppy with him on the visit. And Nigel loves him.

{"date": "March 19, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tI struggled with this one for\u00a0a while, not just for Nigel but also for myself.\nIn late 1997, after crying one afternoon because I could not stop rearranging the chairs around the kitchen table, I realized that the anxiety wasn\u2019t going away on its own. I had several other symptoms as well: peeling skin off the bottoms of my feet until they bled, systematically pulling out my hair, and chronic insomnia. I finally went to a doctor and was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder. The \u2018when it rains it pours\u2019 adage is unmercifully true: my diagnosis came one month before Nigel\u2019s autism diagnosis and my husband\u2019s announcement that he wanted to be separated.\nFor six months prior to obtaining medication for myself, I had struggled with believing that it was necessary, that it wasn\u2019t a sign of weakness. The doctor had to remind me that if something was wrong with any other part of my body, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to obtain the medication I needed. If I had a heart disease, I\u00a0might need antiplatelet drugs. If I were diabetic, I would need insulin. I agreed to a low dosage of Zoloft, and I experienced relief from my symptoms within days of taking it. I took it for a year and a half.\nWithin the past year, I had noticed that Nigel exhibited signs of anxiety, possibly OCD. He pulled out his hair so much he would create bald spots. He would rub his lips so\u00a0hard that\u00a0 he had rough, bleeding patches around his mouth. He had chronic insomnia. I had thought that his anxiety was environmental, due to the constant stress of the middle school. When I pulled him out of the school, his lips/mouth area improved, but he still had insomnia. And the worst thing was that not only was he still pulling out his hair, he had started eating it. I knew then that, even though he was only thirteen, he needed medication. Also, I have read that autistic teens are highly susceptible to depression, and with that running in our family as well, I figured getting him on Zoloft now might cut the depression off at the pass. There are some in my family who think I jumped the proverbial gun, that he\u2019s too young to be on medication, that I should wait and see. But pulling out your hair and eyelashes and eating them indicates\u00a0a definite need for medication, and I do not regret my decision.\nI am happy to report that Nigel is sleeping much better now and has a full head of hair. Life goes on. And I am\u00a0far too busy to be rearranging the chairs around the kitchen table, thank God.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/03/19/medication/", "title": "Medication"},

Eddy and I were in several of the same classes since freshman year, and by junior year, we had become pretty close. We never dated, but we talked a lot, and one day during class he ran out, visibly upset, and the teacher suggested I go check on him. I found him sitting on the steps of the side entrance of the building, and I sat next to him and gave him a hug. He told me that he was coming to terms with the fact that he was gay. He didn\u2019t know how to tell anyone; he felt confused and a little scared. I\u00a0assured him I would be there for him.\nMonths later,\u00a0Eddy felt better and more sure of himself. His family had responded positively to the news and his friends supported him. He said that he couldn\u2019t believe that it was happening to him. He had read and heard about people being gay, but until he acknowledged that he was, he never realized what it would be like, how it would affect him. He said that he felt like\u00a0now he belonged to\u00a0The Gay Club. And that it would determine the rest of his life.\nI certainly didn\u2019t feel it at first, but over the years I have come to realize that with my son\u2019s diagnosis I was granted lifetime membership in what I call The Autism Club. I had read and heard about autism, but I had no idea what it was like until I came to live with it. I couldn\u2019t believe it was happening to me. I never realized how it would affect me. It will continue to determine the rest of my life.\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for any parent of a child with a disability. You start going to all the IEP meetings, the team meetings with therapists, the therapy appointments, dealing with trying to take your child out in public, finding a good fit with a program or school and changing frequently when it doesn\u2019t fit. You come to terms with how the disability affects all the family members, now and in the future. You realize that your lives are going to be different than those of your neighbors, and even your friends. You wonder how it will affect your other child, having a special needs sibling.\nSo you go to the meetings, you do what you need to do, you give attention and show empathy to your other child, and somehow, as the years go by you realize that you are functioning, you are doing this. Life goes on. It\u2019s different, it\u2019s not how you thought it would be, not what you would have wished for yourself and your children, but it\u2019s okay.\nSome might think I\u2019m trivializing the experience by calling it The Autism Club. It is in no way trivial, and I know that only too well. It affects every fiber of my being. But I have to keep reminding myself that there are millions of parents of autistic kids, all going through what I go through. And that makes me feel like we\u2019re all part of some special club or association. We didn\u2019t ask to join. But we\u2019re making the best of it.

I\u2019ve devised my own theory.\nI believe that thimerosol is partly responsible for some cases of autism. What I emphatically believe is that in the last thirty years,\u00a0large amounts of chemical toxins in our\u00a0environment (including our food, air, and water)\u00a0are contributing (not causing, but contributing) to the increase of autism cases, along with increased awareness for diagnosing the milder cases.\u00a0Thimerosol in vaccines is included on my list of chemical toxins. But I certainly don\u2019t believe that all cases of autism were caused by thimerosol.\nWhen I was six months pregnant with Nigel, I experienced pre-term labor and was hospitalized\u00a0while I received terbutaline intravenously. I have often wondered if the presence of this chemical affected Nigel\u2019s\u00a0development in utero. I believe he was genetically predisposed to autism, and the\u00a0introduction of harsh chemicals through medication I received as well as the aggressive inoculation program\u00a0thrust upon\u00a0him after birth caused him to develop autism.\u00a0It was the combination, not\u00a0just one or the other.\nHence the variance of the spectrum. I think this theory also helps to explain why some severely autistic children can, with therapy, progress to mid-functioning or even high-funtioning levels, while others do not. It also explains why some autistic individuals respond so well to GF/CF diets, while others do not.\u00a0Autism manifests itself differently in each\u00a0individual because there are so many different causes and contributing factors.\nI hope I live to see the day when we understand\u00a0more of\u00a0the complexities of autism, and maybe have some concrete answers.

{"date": "March 20, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tThere has been so much research done\u00a0on music as autism therapy that I couldn\u2019t possibly address the multitude of positive effects from it in one post. What I will do here is discuss the effects that I have seen with Nigel, including increased verbal skills, better sensory integration, and calming influences.\nAccording to the Autism Research Institute, \u201cAutistic children have also made enormous strides in eliminating their monotonic speech by singing songs composed to match the rhythm, stress, flow and inflection of the sentence followed by a gradual fading of the musical cues.\u201d In his early years, Nigel watched a ton of Disney videos from which he learned to use echolalia as a means to communicate. These Disney videos also had songs that he would memorize that taught him rhythm and voice inflection, and from them he gradually gained the verbal skill\u00a0of\u00a0using his own words.\nAs he got older, Nigel began to pay more attention to the music I listen to, which is a mix of classic rock, alternative, techno/dance, world, celtic, and more. I noticed\u00a0that the categories that feature harder, faster beats (some rock and techno) seemed to help with his sensory integration. He learned how to filter sounds that previously had caused him to go into sensory overload, like air hand driers in public restrooms and other loud, mechanical sounds. And now, he likes the music for its own sake;\u00a0he rotates his favorite CDs\u00a0on his own stereo (mostly movie soundtracks like Twister, Back to the Future, and Cars) and sings along.\nWhen he wants to unwind and relax, he turns to some more of my music. I am happily employed by a company called New Earth Records, a\u00a0spiritually conscious\u00a0music label specializing in New Age, world, trance, healing music, and Osho meditations.\u00a0Nigel enjoys the beat and different instruments (sitar and\u00a0sarangi) of James Asher\u2019s Tigers of the Raj, the relaxing trance rhythms of Cybertribe\u2019s Immortality (Nigel says: \u201cIt relaxes away the stress of the day\u201d), and the beautiful melody of Lisa Lynne\u2019s harp on Love & Peace. When I put on Deuter\u2019s Sun Spirit, Nigel commented how much he liked the cover (Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cOlive Trees\u201d) and said that the music made him feel \u201clike you\u2019re in the Renaissance.\u201d Another title of Deuter\u2019s that I play is Earth Blue, which makes Nigel say, \u201cI feel like I want to sleep.\u201d For someone with occasional insomnia, that\u2019s invaluable, as are all the benefits of listening to music.\nI highly recommend playing music for an autistic child (and\u00a0every child), not only\u00a0as an effective\u00a0therapeutic device, but\u00a0also for the\u00a0soothing value of it. Music adds to the quality of one\u2019s environment and life in so many ways.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://newearthrecords.com/", "http://www.newearthrecords.com/web/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=0&idproduct=114", "http://www.newearthrecords.com/web/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=0&idproduct=91", "http://www.newearthrecords.com/web/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=0&idproduct=1378", "http://www.newearthrecords.com/web/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=0&idproduct=34", "http://www.newearthrecords.com/web/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=0&idproduct=18", "http://www.samedaymusic.com/library--musictherapyfortheautisticchild"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/03/20/music/", "title": "Music"},

I knew it would be the perfect book for me to read.\nThe approach of accepting autism would have been enough on its own for me to like the book, but Susan Senator\u2019s writing is exceptional, and that is why I love\u00a0this book. I laughed, I cried, I truly felt she\u2019s been through the same trenches I have. She understands. And she exudes a level of empathy through her words that brought me more comfort than any other book about autism I have read.\u00a0\u00a0\nSenator opens with a situation that is all too familiar to many ASD families:\u00a0something occurs that necessitates making a transition before the autistic family member is ready, and an outburst ensues. Senator drew me in with her description of what happened and how each family member was affected by it, and I certainly identified with all of it.\nThe book then continues in a chronological format, discussing her son\u2019s early years, how he lined up his toys and stared at them\u00a0while he\u00a0sucked his thumb, which was exactly what my son did (although he sucked his index and middle finger instead of his thumb). She discussed her reaction to the diagnosis, going into depth about her emotions and listing all the questions that those of us who have been through it also asked. All the whys, hows, and what-do-we-do-nows. Senator includes a \u201csidebar\u201d in this chapter called \u201cSuggestions for Getting Through the Early Days, After Diagnosis,\u201d which lists some helpful tips, along with other topics such as \u201cBeginning the Healing Process as a Couple\u201d and \u201cMaking Crisis Storybooks for Your Child,\u201d known as \u2018social stories\u2019 in some areas.\nThe following chapter describes the various early school programs in which her son was enrolled, and includes tips on preparing for IEP meetings, and what to look for with school placements. This information is invaluable for parents whose child has been recently diagnosed. I found myself wishing this book had been\u00a0published in the 90s!\nThe next chapter addresses sibling interactions and\u00a0traveling, including tips for successful family vacations. Following that is a chapter on sleep problems and the use of medication, with a thoughtful debate on whether to medicate or not. I found this chapter particularly helpful to me because I\u00a0happened to be making a decision about putting\u00a0my son on Zoloft right at the time that I\u00a0first read the book. Basically,\u00a0Senator urges parents to\u00a0trust their instincts, which\u00a0is something I must constantly remind myself, and educate themselves.\u00a0The chapter also listed strategies for dealing with problem behavior.\nThe remaining chapters deal with more family issues, such as preparing for a new baby in the house and nurturing your marriage (which I read in a wistful way, mine having ended\u00a0many years ago). The chapter also mentions important information about leaving your child with others and making sure to carve out time to rest.\nAt one point, Senator writes: \u201c. . .we moved from grieving over his disability to over grieving what lay ahead for him.\u201d This resonated with me as I made the decision to homeschool my son and deal with all the changes it encompassed. I found Making Peace with Autism to be empowering in the face of my own struggle.\nMy favorite part of the book is when\u00a0Senator\u00a0discovers that her son is trying to\u00a0connect with\u00a0her by laughing. I, too, made this discovery with my own son years ago.\u00a0\u00a0My son\u2019s\u00a0annoying fake laugh is really the way he reaches out, wanting to have fun like everyone he sees around him. He is not completely closed off, in his own world. He has autism, but he is still there with us, interacting. Just on his own terms. It was so affirming to read that other families delight in this discovery as well.\nI just leafed through the book again and realized that I had another \u201cfavorite part,\u201d near the end.\u00a0It was when Senator\u2019s autistic son had his bar mitzvah: all the preparations they made, everything it meant to them, the happiness that flooded them with their extended family in attendance. So beautiful and inspiring.\nI can\u2019t say enough good things about this book. I think every family trying to come to terms with autism should read it.\u00a0I also highly recommend\u00a0reading Senator\u2019s blog at www.susansenator.com. On it, she mentions that she just finished writing a novel.

Riley has been Nigel\u2019s friend for about five years, and while Riley has several other good friends he would probably rather hang with on a Saturday, he always makes time for Nigel and accepts him, autism notwithstanding.\nNigel has always been a social person, which I think is what propelled him to step outside of himself and learn to talk. When he was about five and not functionally verbal, he would approach NT kids at the playground and try to engage them the only way he knew how: laughter. The problem was that the kids would think that he was laughing AT them, of course, which caused a slew of problems necessitating me to intervene. I think it was because of these unsuccessful\u00a0experiments in the social realm that Nigel decided if he wanted to have friends, he needed to learn to talk.\nOne of my favorite sites for autism information is Natural Learning Concepts, which recently posted an in-depth interview with Stephen Shore that I really enjoyed reading. Here is what he says about friendship: \u201cIt is my sense that people with autism don\u2019t want to have friends is a myth.\u00a0 What seems more accurate is that those of us on the autism spectrum have a different way of making friends.\u201d\u00a0 So profound and yet so simple. I wholeheartedly agree.\nMaking a friend was a huge milestone for Nigel. And learning how to keep that friend has also been a milestone. It hasn\u2019t always been easy: over the years, Nigel has had outbursts at school, including some resulting in injury to Riley,\u00a0that I\u2019m sure have caused Riley to reevaluate if it would be advantageous to continue being Nigel\u2019s friend. But Riley does and he is. His presence and his loyalty\u00a0encourage Nigel\u2019s self-esteem more than anything else, I think.\u00a0\nGod bless the Rileys of the world, and bless their parents for raising them to be such patient, understanding kids.

{"date": "April 22, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tOne of the most difficult things to teach an autistic person is empathy. It can require years of repetition, and even then reminders are needed; rarely is an empathetic act spontaneous, at least in my experience. It\u2019s just due to the nature of autism \u2013 inherent in the \u201caut\u201d (self) part of it. And so, we have to teach them to care, and we hope that one of these days they\u2019ll do it on their own.\nThis past weekend Nigel went on a two-night backpacking trip with his Boy Scout troop, and I stayed home with Aidan. Nigel\u00a0usually does very well with the troop, provided they\u2019re not doing\u00a0the type of\u00a0gift exchange where\u00a0everyone picks a number, and the higher number-holders get to \u201ctrade\u201d gifts\u00a0with the lower number-holders, whether they want to or not. No, Nigel didn\u2019t do well with that. He lost a giant chocolate bar that way, and he\u2019ll never forget it (I\u2019m sure no one else from the troop who\u00a0attended that gift exchange will forget it either).\u00a0But other than that, most of his outings with the troop are problem-free. I asked the scoutmaster to remind Nigel to take his medication, and off they went on a 13-mile backpacking trip.\nUpon their return, I asked the scoutmaster how things went, and he said that Nigel did really well. He only took issue with having to get into a wet tent after it had rained. But then the scoutmaster told me that one of the nights he woke up to what he thought was a coyote, then he realized it was one of the kids crying. He got up to investigate and realized it was coming from Nigel\u2019s tent, which he shared with another boy.\u00a0The scoutmaster\u00a0stood and listened as he heard Nigel consoling the other boy whose stomach was hurting. When the other boy said he wanted to go home, Nigel calmly stated that there were no motorized vehicles to take them home and that he should try to relax. The next morning the scoutmaster thanked Nigel for helping the other boy.\nIt has taken many years, with many setbacks along the way, but Nigel has reached a very important milestone: showing empathy (in a leaky tent, no less). I\u2019m certainly not deluding myself into thinking that it will always be like this from now on, but it\u2019s an encouraging start. It\u2019s more than encouraging; it\u2019s truly wonderful.

When I was growing up, clothes that we slept in were called \u2018nighties\u2019 instead of \u2018pajamas,\u2019 and I didn\u2019t like them much anyway. I would have rather worn a t-shirt and sweatpants to bed, which I started doing in college. I had my kids do the same; it just seemed more comfortable.\nWhen Aidan could talk (which was delayed, possibly because of having an older autistic sibling), he asked, \u201cWhy are the pants called \u2018sweatpants?'\u201d\nMe: Because some people wear them when they\u2019re exercising and they sweat.\nAidan: But we don\u2019t.\nHence, the\u00a0phrase sleeping pants was conceived. And in the summer, they wear sleeping shorts. Everything has to be labeled very literally around here.\nBedtime is always a mad dash for the boys to get everything done that they wanted to do for the day, all of their little Lego projects, stuff they wanted to look up online, as well as the requisite teeth-brushing, homework-checking, and lunch-making for the next day. As a result, they are rarely in bed at the stated time, which is as late as I can stand it because they have never, even as babies, needed much sleep for some\u00a0unlucky reason.\nSo it\u2019s 10:30 PM and I\u2019m really wanting to close up shop for the night and maybe read in bed for half an hour before going to sleep myself. Aidan\u2019s already down (required since he\u2019s younger), but Nigel is still in mad-dash mode. He\u2019s running out to the game room to find one last Lego piece (a Ghengis Khan-style helmet), he\u2019s printing out a chart of the International Date Line from Wikipedia, and he\u2019s saying good night to the cat. I order him to brush his teeth and get in bed because I want to go to bed.\nI shut off the lights, check the doors, turn down the heater, and go back to Nigel\u2019s room to say good night to him, hoping he\u2019s ready.\nNigel: I have to put on my sleeping pants.\nMe: Let me say good night to you and then put on your sleeping pants.\nNigel: I have to put my sleeping pants on before you say good night to me. It breaks my traditions.\nAnd in the second before I respond, I think, Wow, what a beautiful sentence. Two! He can now express his needs with words instead of screaming, as he would have just a few short years ago. And I say, \u201cOkay,\u201d and close the door until he says, \u201cI\u2019m finished.\u201d\nYes, he has his rituals. Things often need to be done in a certain order (unfortunately cleaning his room does not fall into that category). But there are many things that Nigel\u2019s flexible about, and I can give him a minute to finish up with the\u00a0rituals that he feels a need to perpetuate. The traditions.

That is certainly a less-traveled road.\nBut it\u2019s also certainly one that, as Robert Frost\u2019s immortal poem deems, has made \u201call the difference.\u201d I ran into a friend today while walking to the library with Nigel, and she asked how the homeschooling\u2019s been going. I told her that it\u2019s the best decision I ever made.\nI often get asked what type of program I\u2019m doing, so I thought I\u2019d describe that a bit. When I was initially researching homeschooling techniques, I discovered that there are as many different ways to homeschool as there are families who do it. The programs vary from highly structured to something called unschooling\u00a0and everything in between. I decided on a structured schedule with a flexible curriculum.\u00a0On any given day, Nigel and I work with the following sources: his public school-assigned math book, workbooks from Clas E. Professor, articles on Wikipedia, Kids Discover Magazine, National Geographic books and magazines, CD-Rom programs, educational videos and books checked out from our local library as well as the middle school library, and books from our own collection.\u00a0We have more than enough material to work with, and aside from what I\u2019ve spent on the books and CD-Roms we already had that we\u2019ve accumulated over the years, this year I spent $20 on a Kids Discover subscription and $40 on workbooks. That\u2019s it! That\u2019s our homeschool budget! Of course there\u2019s the reduced income to consider when figuring the real cost of homeschooling, but it\u2019s worth it. Definitely.\nThe other thing I did in preparing to homeschool was to go to our state\u2019s department of education website and inform myself about our state\u2019s requirements for homeschooling. I also thoroughly read and noted their detailed list of grade level standards, i.e. what each student is expected to know by the end of benchmark years (3rd, 5th, and 8th grades). My goal is to follow the list of grade level standards because Nigel has expressed a desire to transition back to public school in 9th or 10th grade so that he can attend our local high school. I would certainly love for him to be able to do that, so in designing his curriculum I try to keep up with whatever the state says his peers are supposed to be doing academically. That resource was extremely helpful in figuring out what to teach him. (For anyone interested, here is the webpage\u00a0with Oregon\u2019s grade level standards for every academic subject.)\nIt was a bit of work designing my own homeschool program, and some financial sacrifice, but every day I see the benefits.

{"date": "April 22, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tYesterday I wrote a post about Nigel showing empathy without being prompted, and today I thought I\u2019d write one to illustrate his development in that area, and how far he\u2019s come.\nNigel has been involved in Scouting since 2004, and it has been entirely positive. He\u2019s been in Boy Scouts for two years and was in Cub Scouts for almost two years. Three years ago,\u00a0when he was\u00a0ten, we were attending a monthly Pack Meeting at the elementary school, and there was a stage set up in the gym for the school\u2019s annual talent show, which was held that same week. The Pack Meetings were typically held in the gym, so all the kids had fun climbing on the stage and play-acting. One Scout\u2019s younger sister (about age four) slipped and somehow became wedged in between the stage and the wall behind the stage. She was stuck tight, and it took at least five minutes of planning and carefully moving the stage to get her out. One of her thighs had taken the brunt of being stuck, so it had been scraped, but other than that, she did not appear to be seriously injured, and was mostly crying out of fear.\nThe whole episode peaked Nigel\u2019s interest. If I had realized the reason behind his interest and taken into account his lack of empathy, I would have stopped him from going over to the worried parents as they comforted their daughter when she was removed from the stage. I would have stopped him anyway, if I had been close enough to him, since I didn\u2019t want him getting in the way. But he was not near me when I saw him walk quickly over to the parents, and I dashed to catch up to him to distract him before he could reach them. I arrived just as he loudly asked, \u201cCan I see the scar?\u201d The mother scowled at him, turned, and walked away carrying her daughter.\nI, mortified, apologized to the father and led Nigel away, explaining to him that what he asked was not appropriate when people are hurt. At the time I thought the concept was lost on him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to touch it; just look at it,\u201d he persisted. But something about my response must have stayed with him. He must have absorbed it, filed it away, as he does with every other piece of information that comes his way. And gradually, over the years, he is learning to apply it, along with every other time I\u2019ve tried to teach him about empathy, what is appropriate to say or not, and what would be the best response in a situation. He is learning that what really matters are people and how they feel. And as evidenced by what happened on the recent backpacking trip, he\u2019s starting to do this on his own.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/04/22/lack-thereof/", "title": "Lack Thereof"},

Is it even possible that a person can be autistic but also be extroverted? How? And wouldn\u2019t that be the ultimate cruel irony? Someone who desperately wants to be social having a developmental issue that makes the very thing he wants be nearly insurmountable to achieve.\nI truly believe that Nigel has\u00a0struggled with this since toddlerhood, possibly even infancy. Long before he was verbal he would try, always unsuccessfully, to interact with his peers. He couldn\u2019t talk, so he went up to them and laughed, only to be misinterpreted with disastrous results. He would try to interact with adults by going up to them and saying their license plate number. He wanted so badly to connect with people, but they were people\u00a0in\u00a0a world from which he so desperately needed relief. He couldn\u2019t go into public places because he did not know how to filter all the sounds that bombarded him and caused him such agony. His sensory issues were so extreme that they \u2013 and his social issues \u2013 prevented him from being true to his social nature and his desire to be a social person.\nSo, Nigel evolved. He had to if he wanted to interact with people. Various therapies had a lot to do with his success, but I firmly believe that his drive to be social in the first place is what motivated him to\u00a0keep trying to connect and caused him to respond to the therapy as well as he did. He somehow, over several years\u2019 time, learned to filter out the sounds that prevented him from going into stores, restaurants, public restrooms, etc. He stretched his cognitive skills to not only repeat lines from videos he\u2019d seen, but then he\u00a0used certain lines and fit them within the context of a situation in order to express himself verbally. He wanted to communicate. It just took him several years to learn how.\nIt is truly remarkable what he has achieved. I have a friend with adult ADHD, and he has said that on some level he can identify with Nigel because of his own experience with learning to regulate certain aspects of his behavior. It took a lot of time, patience, awareness, and hard work, but the rewards have been well worth it.\nI am an introvert. Had I been autistic, I probably would not have talked. I don\u2019t think I would have cared. I enjoy being in my own head so much as it is that, were I autistic, I would most likely love to stay there. I certainly don\u2019t mean to simplify the complexities of autism and the reasons why some autistic individuals learn to talk and some don\u2019t. Nor do I mean to propose that some autistic people just choose not to talk because they are introverts. \u00a0But I can\u2019t help but think that the way we are socially wired \u2013 introvert or extrovert \u2013\u00a0has\u00a0to\u00a0affect autistic individuals as well. I don\u2019t think that autism would cancel out a person\u2019s natural inclination to be social, if that\u2019s in his or her personality. I see it every day with my son.

A visual schedule will tell the student with autism what activities will occur and in what sequence.\n\nVisual schedules are important for children with autism because they:\n\nHelp address the child\u2019s difficulty with sequential memory and organization of time.\nAssist children with language comprehension problems to understand what is expected of them (5).\nLessen the anxiety level of children with autism, and thus reduce the possible occurrence of challenging behaviors, by providing the structure for the student to organize and predict daily and weekly events.\nAssist the student in transitioning independently between activities and environments by telling them where they are to go next.\nCan increase a student\u2019s motivation to complete less desired activities by strategically alternating more preferred with less-preferred activities on the student\u2019s individual visual schedule.\nExample: By placing a \u201ccomputer\u201d time after \u201cmath\u201d, the student may be more motivated to complete math knowing that \u201ccomputer\u201d time will be next.\n\n\nFor the student with autism, the consistent use of a visual schedule is an extremely important skill. It has the potential to increase independent functioning throughout his life \u2013 at school, home and community. \n\n\n\n\n\nWithout a doubt, schedules are highly effective tools. But Nigel\u2019s schedules over the years have been much more than that. They have been a type of therapy. And I\u2019m sure they will continue to function as such perhaps for all his life.\nYesterday I wrote about the type of homeschooling program I\u2019m doing with Nigel and how I designed it. Here is his weekly schedule:\nTime: What we are doing Monday through Thursday\n8:00 alarm rings\n8:10 out of bed, go to the bathroom, wash face\n8:15 eat breakfast, rinse bowl\n8:20 brush teeth\n8:23 get dressed\n8:30 start homeschool: Math: 1 pg of If Mathematics, 1 pg of Core Skills Math\n9:00 Writing/Language Arts: 1 pg Quick Practice Writing Skills; Essay Writing, either 1 section with Mom or 1 pg by self\n9:30 Science: go online to study topics from Grade Level Standards; take 5 footnotes from websites\n10:10 snack & 10-min. break\n10:20 Social Science: read books from library or go to websites to study topics from Grade Level Standards; take 5 footnotes from each source\n11:00 Physical Education or Library Time\nMon: bike ride on Greenway\nTues: 15 min. yoga/15 min. push-ups & weights\nWed: walk to Phoenix library or drive to TMS library\ncheck out 3 items: 1 social science book, 1 educational DVD, 1 book of choice\nThurs: 15 min. yoga/15 min. push-ups & weights\n11:30T/Th Elective for the week (see elective list)\n12:00 prepare & eat lunch\n12:30 check responsibility chart & do chores for that day: when chores complete, you have free time\nOn Fridays I go into the office for a few hours, so that day has a different schedule. Nigel gets up at the same time and then takes one of the aforementioned educational videos, watches it, takes 5 \u201cfootnotes,\u201d as he likes to call them, and then types a summary on his computer to show me when I get home. I am fortunate that he has reached a point where he will be okay for a few hours alone at home, following his schedule. Maybe it\u2019s a lifeline for me too.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.specialed.us/autism/structure/str11.htm"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/04/26/the-schedule/", "title": "The Schedule"},
{"date": "March 20, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tI come from a family of theater enthusiasts, myself included. And although I am the only one of four children never to have starred in a play, I was always happy to watch them. Enthralled, actually. A good production is amazing to see, and even better to share. \nSo I always wondered if my son, now fifteen, would ever be able to enjoy seeing a play with me. In the past, it was out of the question. His sensory issues due to his autism and his need for frequent breaks would not have made a play possible. He would have never made it to intermission. But his love of movies has sparked a recent interest in theater, so he started taking a theater class as an elective. And when comp tickets for a student-written play were given out to his class, he was motivated to go.\nWe ran through a little social story beforehand to prepare him \u2013 must not talk or make any noises during the play, must not get up before intermission unless it\u2019s an emergency, etc. The theater class students were to sit in a reserved section of the theater \u2013 the first three rows. I urged him to sit near the aisle in case he needed to leave, and then I went to find a seat several rows behind him. I loved watching him choose his seat in the ten minutes before the play began. First, he sat in the third row near the aisle \u2013 good, I thought. He stayed there for a few minutes, and then he got up and nonchalantly moved to the middle of the front row. Probably not the best choice for him. He seemed a little uncomfortable there, and sure enough, he got up after a moment and moved again. Then Goldilocks settled in the second row, a few seats over from the aisle. Well done, I thought. And there he stayed.\nThe lights dimmed, and the play, a musical adaptation of The Lord of the Flies (yes, I said musical), began. I was highly intrigued to see how the songs would be handled, and I must say that I was quite impressed. This was definitely not a comedic musical; the songs were well written in a dramatic tone and fit seamlessly in the course of the story. And what a talented group of young actors and singers! The boy in the roll of Ralph had an incredible singing voice \u2013 I could have listened to him for hours. All of the students amazed me \u2013 the set was admirable, and the performance was flawless. \nAt intermission, Nigel got up and I met him out in the aisle, where he quietly told me that he was going to the bathroom. I told him how well he was doing and went back to my seat. Nigel came back a few minutes later and returned to the same spot in the second row. He turned around and gave me a little smile, and my heart soared. \nWhen the play ended, he applauded with everyone else and then came back to find me. I could tell that he was a little worked up, and I stuck close to him as we filed out of the theater. We entered the foyer, and all the actors were out greeting people. Nigel walked toward the actor who played the character Piggy, held his (own) arms up, and said triumphantly, \u201cIt was magnificent!\u201d I smiled, not remembering when I last heard so much emotion in his usually stoic voice. Piggy thanked him and said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you could make it!\u201d My son then introduced me to the talented boy, a senior, who had adapted the play and written the songs, and had starred in the roll of Jack. I shook his hand and congratulated him, telling him how amazing it was. Inside, I marveled at all these wonderful kids who had befriended my son, a freshman with the different speech patterns, sensory issues, and social mannerisms of autism. These kids were so genuine, so sincere. They welcomed him as one of them.\nI asked Nigel if he was ready to go. I could tell he was a little amped up, and even I was starting to feel a little claustrophobic. Things had gone well, and I wanted to get home and relax. \u201cWait! I want you to meet Ian,\u201d he said, looking around. How did he know all these kids?! This was a side of him I had never seen before! And then, as if to illustrate that point exactly, he suddenly called out, \u201cIan!\u201d and threw his arms around the boy who had played Ralph, the one whose voice I loved. Nigel gave him an immense hug \u2013 a victory hug. And Ralph/Ian hugged him back, smiling and thanking him. \nIt was the first time I had ever seen my son initiate a hug. All his life he\u2019s patiently \u2013 albeit stiffly \u2013 accepted our hugs, indulged us. I\u2019ve always said that hugging Nigel was like hugging a surfboard, and the taller he gets, the truer that is. Once, when I surprised him with homemade chicken tacos (his favorite dinner), he tackled me with a wrestling move that literally took me to the floor, but I\u2019d never seen him solicit a real hug in his fifteen years.\u00a0 And now there was this. This perfectly executed, wonderfully appropriate, well-received hug. And I got to see it happen, right before my eyes. It was beautiful, something I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d ever see. \n\u201cThis is my mom,\u201d I heard my son say. I felt like I was in a dream \u2013 people talking and moving all around me, creating a sort of buzz that put me in a hazy state. And I was overjoyed, just filled with emotion, choking back tears as I smiled and shook the hand of yet another talented young man who obviously means a lot to my son. I told him how much I enjoyed his singing; I wasn\u2019t able to get much else out.\nWe left soon afterward, walking side by side to the car in the cold night air. Nigel exclaimed how great the play was, and I was so happy to have enjoyed it with him. I breathed in sharply to fend off my joyful tears, thinking only of the wonderful gifts that were bestowed upon me that night \u2013 watching a play with my son and witnessing a most glorious, unexpected hug. Every day with my son I learn that the simplest things are often the most profoundly experienced.\n\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/03/20/the-plays-the-thing/", "title": "The Play\u2019s the Thing"},
{"date": "March 25, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nSince the boys are gone this week for Spring Break (visiting their dad in L.A.) and I am feeling the usual disjointedness with them away, I figured it was time for another edition of Personal Posts. Because I\u2019m sure you were all waiting for it with baited breath, right? No? Okay.\nBut surely you must be slightly curious about the raw food thing I wrote about last time. You might recall that I was pretty excited about it, and I still am, but I\u2019ve had to slow waaaay down with it. I got a little overzealous and went 100% raw and lost weight that I didn\u2019t need to lose (nor wanted to). While it\u2019s true that many people go on a raw food diet specifically to lose weight and become healthier, I just wanted to become healthier and increase my energy. And I discovered that being underweight does not make one feel energetic. So I cut back to about 50% raw for the time being while I try to gain back the weight I lost. I know \u2013 that\u2019s not something you usually hear \u2013 trying to gain back weight \u2013 but some of us unfortunately fit into that category. I am still having green smoothies for breakfast every morning, which I love. So, I\u2019m not giving up on raw, but I have to find a way to do it without losing weight, and that may take me a while since I\u2019m focusing on several other things.\nAnd one of the things I\u2019ve been focusing on is publishing my book. Like, really focusing, pushing myself. And I am thrilled to say that I\u2019ve made significant progress! In fact, I hope to be sharing some exciting news very soon! Sorry no deets yet \u2013 that will be described in a post of its own, you can be sure. \u00a0But I promise I won\u2019t leave you hanging for long!\nIn other news, we\u2019ve lived in our current home for almost seven years, and the carpet is sporting seven years\u2019 worth of stains and hard living (with two boys and various pets trampling it), so I\u2019m having it replaced. I had hoped to have it done while the boys were away, but it turns out that the installers are on Spring Break as well. So it\u2019s going to be done next week, and I\u2019ve spent all of this week moving everything out of the rooms and closets \u2013 seven years\u2019 worth of books, DVDs, papers, Lego, clothing, Nerf guns, action figures, cars, stuffed animals, and whatever else I stuffed in our back room, to be sorted later. Then I touched up the walls in the rooms that will get new carpet, and I used up a half gallon of paint just \u201ctouching up\u201d the boys\u2019 rooms! \u00a0Not to mention half a container of Spackle. God help me, boys are hard on a house!\nBut those boys are also the loves of my life, and I enjoyed talking to them on the phone yesterday. They are having a blast, spending time with their dad and visiting with L.A. friends, and they even got to go to Universal Studios! Nigel was ecstatic over the Jurassic Park ride, of course. Aidan, with his vestibular issues, preferred the Mummy ride. They had flown down again, their second solo flight, and everything went well. When it was time to board, I waited with them in line for a few minutes, and as they neared the ticket-taking agent, Aidan said gently, \u201cMom, I think we\u2019ll be fine now. You don\u2019t need to wait with us.\u201d And Nigel chimed in, \u201cYeah.\u201d So I tried not to cry and hugged them, saying, \u201cBe safe and have a great time. I love you!\u201d And as I stepped out of the line, an older\u00a0lady a few feet behind us said good-naturedly, \u201cYou boys be good now!\u201d And right then, at that moment in the airport, I felt like a regular parent. A regular parent saying goodbye to her teenage sons as they boarded a plane, trusting that everything would be fine.\nI smiled and waved, watching them pull their carry-ons. And for the first time, I felt normal. I know \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t use that word. I even discourage Nigel from using it when he describes non-autistic people, because I want him to think of himself as normal too. But the nonchalant way that woman said what she said, and the way I felt just knowing that I didn\u2019t have to worry, I can\u2019t\u00a0think of another\u00a0word for it. I guess the fact that I was aware of feeling that way negates the normalcy of it. But I don\u2019t care. I felt normal, or what I assumed felt normal, and it was great, that little glimpse. And hard-won. I sat at the gate for a while longer, and then I watched the plane take off, taking my beautiful, almost-grown boys with it. And although I feel disjointed with them away, somehow it feels a little more manageable this time. A little more normal.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_foodism"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/03/25/the-lowdown-vol-3/", "title": "The Lowdown, Vol. 3"},
{"date": "March 22, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nRecently, someone found TeenAutism by searching \u201cCan autistic teens have obsessive thoughts?\u201d and probably stumbled upon the entire Obsessions category over there on the right. Because in Nigel\u2019s case, you might as well ask, \u201cIs there snow on Mt. Everest?\u201d and the answer would be all the time. And while of course not all autistic teens have obsessive thoughts, it\u2019s probably safe to say that many do.\nAt this point, I should probably define what I mean by \u201cobsessive thoughts.\u201d I am not referring to what is commonly called a \u201cspecialist subject.\u201d Nigel has those, too. Those are things that he has a strong interest in, usually over a long period of time. Things like Lego, Disney, dinosaurs, space exploration, time travel, science, geography, history, and movies. Nigel has been intensely interested in all of those things since he was very young. These interests tend to ebb and flow, with him focusing on one or more at a given time, on some sort of a rotation. Two things \u2013 Lego and movies \u2013 have been a necessary part of his daily life for many years. But I wouldn\u2019t say that he is obsessed with them, even though he loves them.\n\u201cObsessive thoughts,\u201d at least in Nigel\u2019s case, generally revolve around his ideas. Nigel is\u00a0a classic\u00a0\u201cidea man.\u201d His first great idea was putting his wooden alphabet blocks together to spell the things he wanted \u2013 because he couldn\u2019t talk. And his ideas only took off from there. Now, he has ideas about everything. But they often become obsessions \u2013 some good, some bad. Take, for example, his science-related obsession with creating fire using a magnifying glass a couple of years ago. It did not end well, and I\u2019ll never forget his remorseful plea \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t obsessions ever go away?\u201d as he voluntarily surrendered his collection of magnifying glasses.\nPotentially good obsessions include his recent idea for a school play based on Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. He wanted to call it \u201cPrincipal, I Shrunk the Students.\u201d The problem was that he became so obsessed with the idea of it, centering the entire play around a Lego mini dinosaur that he wanted to use as a prop, that he lost all track of time and got home from school late, causing me to drive around looking for him. The play idea, like most of his obsessive thoughts, fell by the wayside within a few days. Seldom do they last more than a week, which is why I call them Obsessions of the Week.\nWhy do they fall by the wayside? It\u2019s simply a lack of executive function. Nigel does not have executive function, so he is not able to follow through with most of his ideas. He becomes obsessed with the possibility of them, but he does not have the ability to organize his thoughts and plan out his actions to make his ideas reality. I have tried teaching him how to outline projects on paper, but he is not able to generalize from one thing to another, nor is he able to work independently for any length of time. So, most of his ideas and projects are abandoned after a few days.\nNot surprisingly, this often causes him much frustration. A few weeks ago, he had another idea which turned into an obsessive thought. He wanted to plan a trip to Disneyland for all of the students in the special education program at his high school. The problem was that he wanted to do it for Spring Break, which was less than three weeks away. He went online and found out the cost of Disneyland\u2019s admission ticket, excited because it was less than a hundred dollars. I had to remind him about transportation costs for 30-some students to travel 720 miles by bus, hotel rates, and food. The adjusted cost was much higher, and I tried to explain to him that nineteen days was probably not enough time for the students and their parents to come up with the money. Then he proclaimed that they would do car washes and bake sales, and I calculated for him how many cars they would need to wash or how many cookies they would need to sell each day to raise enough funds for the trip. He suggested that they should wash cars on weekdays, during school, not just weekends. I didn\u2019t even go into the fact that seasonal timing was not on his side \u2013 a car wash in February in Oregon? But he would not let it go. He was obsessed; he went on about it for a week. And no matter how gently I tried to let him down, he could not comprehend that nineteen days (or twelve) was not enough time to plan a trip involving fundraising. Finally, I think his sped teacher at his school was able to get him to realize that something of that scope wasn\u2019t going to happen when he wanted it. He came home, thoroughly dejected, typed the following on his computer, printed it out, and handed it to me: I might as well just accept and pay for my mistake. I\u2019ll never again make new ideas. Here is an excerpt from The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe that I\u2019ll say before I go into self pity: \u201cAnd my soul from out that window, that lies floating on the floor, shall be lifted, NEVERMORE.\u201d\nThe good news is that his teacher is helping him to plan an end-of-the-school-year day trip to a local attraction, so he\u2019s feeling a lot better. And hopefully the experience will help him to realize that we can have great ideas, but unless we allow enough time to organize and plan for them, they\u2019re only going to be obsessive thoughts. And for my idea man, with all of his marvelous ideas, that would truly be a pity.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/03/22/the-idea-man/", "title": "The Idea Man"},

Her second book is excellent on its own, or as a companion to her first, Making Peace with Autism, which I loved and reviewed.\nAnd I love this one, too. Reading it was like Senator holding my hand, leading me through the process, coaching me. The first chapter is an essential look at perspective and how it shapes our views and emotions. It refers not only to our own perspective, but that of our relatives, friends, and neighbors, and society in general. Senator deftly and graciously addresses the issues of depression and coping with judgment and criticism, and she lists helpful strategies for parents to free themselves of \u201cautism baggage.\u201d What follows is a chapter on the various types of therapy and autism treatment, as well as a discussion about the variance of the spectrum and how the autism community is divided over the cause and cure issues. Senator offers concrete advice for gaining perspective on these issues and choosing therapies for our children.\nThe bulk of this exceptional book is filled with many personal anecdotes from various autism parents interviewed by Senator while she researched and wrote the book. These parents candidly offered their experiences in different areas, including having fun with their children on the autism spectrum, planning successful trips, taking care of their own needs, focusing on their marriages, and getting help from others. Senator herself contributes many personal examples and advice in these sections, including a lovely description of a trip her family had taken to Colorado, which involved much planning and preparation. Her son, Nat, attended an extreme-sports camp specifically designed for kids with autism while she, her husband, and their two other children explored Colorado. One of my favorite parts of the book was Senator\u2019s beautiful description of coming back to the camp to pick up Nat. \u201cI was ravenous to see Nat again. We all were, but Nat was nowhere in sight. \u2018Keep watching the trees,\u2019 a counselor told us. The trees? A few moments later, a rustling sound, and then, suspended on a rope from a zipline, Nat came sailing through the trees with a hardhat on his head and a smile on his face.\u201d\nThe final chapters of the book cover our children\u2019s growing up years, including the subject of residential placement, and becoming adults, with sections on independence and advocacy. Since my own son is rapidly approaching this point, I found all of the information especially helpful and comforting, coming from someone like Senator, who eloquently describes both the beauty and the\u00a0difficulty of her experience.

{"date": "January 5, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tSaying goodbye doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s the time we spent together that matters, not how we left it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -Trey Parker and Matt Stone, South Park, Tweek Vs. Craig, 1999\nI have pulled up in front of the high school and am dropping Nigel off in the morning as I have done since he started wrestling two months ago.\n\u201cBye, honey \u2013 I love you; hope you have a good day!\u201d\nHe picks up his backpack and bag of wrestling gear, opens the door and climbs out, shuts the door, and walks into the school without a word, without a glance. This happens every day. And this morning it struck me that even though my son has changed so much in the past ten years, this one thing is still the same. When it\u2019s time to go to school, he doesn\u2019t say goodbye.\nWhen he was five (and for two years before and after), every morning I would walk outside with him when the SPED bus pulled up to the house. I would follow him up the steps of the little bus, greet the driver, and buckle Nigel in his seat. I would kiss his head, tell him I\u2019d see him when he got home, bid the bus driver a good day, and step off the bus. Then I would stand in the front yard, smile, and wave goodbye to my son as the bus pulled away. And every day, Nigel would stare straight ahead. He would not smile; he would not wave. This went on for five years.\nAs time passed, he learned to say goodbye in certain situations. For the past two years, I have been able to leave him home alone for short periods of time, and he will respond, \u201cBye, Mom\u201d when I say goodbye to him. When someone has been visiting our home, he will say \u201cBye\u201d upon their departure, with prompting. It is never initiated.\nAs a parent, I\u2019ve learned to just accept it. I\u2019m sure that they continue to work on it in his social skills class. But the fact is that his hard-won ability to talk does not guarantee the ability or the desire to say what society expects. This is one of the many facets of autism. In his mind, perhaps, it is unnecessary to say a parting word upon leaving someone\u2019s presence, especially when it happens the same way every single morning. Or, perhaps, as he gathers his things, steps out of the car, and readies himself to enter a loud, bustling building and function in an unpredictable environment, he doesn\u2019t have the reserves to say anything, to acknowledge me, to be polite. He is too focused on preparing to begin his day at a place that he would rather not be. Even when he is not being bullied, his sensory filters are in overdrive, and his stress level is high. He has to regulate his behavior with both peers and teachers for almost nine hours. And that ain\u2019t easy. I don\u2019t have the heart to tell him yet again that it would be \u201cpolite\u201d to say goodbye to the person who drops him off.\nAnd so, tomorrow morning, I will pull up to the front curb of the high school and tell my son that I\u2019ll see him when I pick him up after wrestling practice. I\u2019ll say goodbye and tell him that I love him. And he will pick up his things, get out of the car, shut the door, and continue on into the school without responding. And I will drive off to work and be thankful that, at this point, he does as well as he does. As much as I would love to hear him say goodbye, I don\u2019t need to. I\u2019ll just look forward to the smile he gives me when I pick him up from wrestling practice. That\u2019s worth a million forced goodbyes.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/01/05/every-morning/", "title": "Every Morning"},

The Scouts and their parents drive all over our town and the neighboring town, pick up Christmas trees from people\u2019s homes, load them onto trucks and trailers, and take them to a local park where later they are turned into fish habitat and mulch. It\u2019s a great program for the community, and the donations received from it help to fund the Scout Troop\u2019s activities for the year.\nHalfway through the day, we break for lunch, which is prepared and served by Scout parents and siblings at the local church where we have our weekly meetings. During lunch, one of the Scout\u2019s sisters walked around the tables refilling drinks for people. Nigel was seated at a table near me, and as she passed by, he held up his cup for her to refill. She did, and he said, \u201cThank you.\u201d He said it perfectly, so naturally, like he\u2019s\u00a0been saying it all along.\u00a0And he said it\u00a0completely unprompted. \nMy heart raced, and I wanted to stand up and shout, \u201cDid you hear what he just said?! On his own?!\u201d For years, after he finally started talking, I have always had to prompt him to thank someone, whether it\u2019s for a gift, a server bringing him something in a restaurant, me buying something that he wanted, or for anyone helping him in some way. I have repeatedly told him that whenever someone does something for him, even if it\u2019s just holding a door open for him, he should say thank you. And, until yesterday, I had never heard him say it unprompted. The way autism affects him socially, it just doesn\u2019t occur to him to thank people. I think that now, at this age, he understands why he should and that it\u2019s expected, but he usually just doesn\u2019t think of it at the time. He may be battling sensory issues in whatever environment he\u2019s in, or preoccupied in some way that we don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s not because he\u2019s rude and doesn\u2019t have manners. And I know that he does the best that he can, and his family and friends know it too. We don\u2019t hold it against him when he doesn\u2019t thank us.\nBut the general public doesn\u2019t know or understand, and that is why I have continued to drill into him to say thank you. And that\u2019s also why I write and advocate about autism \u2013 so that the general public might start to know and understand, and he can meet them halfway. He won\u2019t always say thank you when he should. He can\u2019t always say thank you. But he tries. And when he does, it\u2019s beautiful to hear. It\u2019s a little thing, but it means so much.\n*For more not-so-little things, check out my friend Jess\u2018s Community Brag Page!

{"date": "March 16, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tLife with autism is full of acronyms. From the first IFSP (Individualized Family Service Plan) meeting\u00a0and the use of PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) to the last IEP (Individual Education Plan), we SPED (Special Education) parents are bombarded with a list of acronyms to learn and use. It seems like such an odd\u00a0element\u00a0of\u00a0an already challenging existence.\nI remember being at Nigel\u2019s first IFSP meeting, when he was three. I felt overwhelmed and underinformed. Back in 1997, autism was not the buzzword it is now. Most parents of now-teens experienced untold frustration trying to research autism information, therapy, symptoms, etc. when their children were first diagnosed. The internet was not the resource it is today, and all the books I could find on autism were archaic, bleak, and (I felt at the time) of no help to me. My local Barnes\u00a0& Noble had two books on autism: Let Me Hear Your Voice, by Catherine Maurice, and The Siege, by Clara Claiborne Clark. I flipped through both of them there in the store, got a lump in my throat, felt the desire to slip into denial (the \u2018how could he be autistic? he smiles and lets me hug him!\u2019 self-talk), and left. I did wind up reading those books at a later date, and I came to consider them an invaluable source of encouragement. Back then I wasn\u2019t ready.\nI went to that first meeting blind. The therapists started talking about PECS, SI (Sensory Integration),\u00a0and OT (Occupational Therapy) and I was completely lost. It wasn\u2019t until months later that I learned that the intensive program that Nigel was enrolled in was actually ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) -based. I learned about various other therapies, including AIT (Auditory Integration Training), FC (Facilitated Communication), and later, the GF/CF (gluten-free/casein-free) diet. When I had internet service I looked up the DAN (Defeat Autism Now) program and joined ASA (Autism Society of America) and read about the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). I needed a glossary to keep them all straight.\nNow when I go to my local Barnes\u00a0& Noble, there is an entire section devoted to autism-related topics, not just two books mixed in the Special Needs shelf (yes, there was only a single shelf for all books on special needs children). And now on\u00a0their website, under the category of Autism and Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, there are 26 subtopics listed and 462 individual books available having to do with autism. That is amazing to me, and wonderful. And many of them\u00a0have glossaries defining all the autism acronyms I\u2019ve come to know and love.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/03/16/autism-acronyms/", "title": "Autism Acronyms"},
{"date": "January 17, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nWhen\u00a0Nigel\u00a0started wrestling two months ago at his high school, I was elated and optimistic. This, as I wrote previously, was something that he\u2019d wanted for a very long time, and he made it happen. Surely that meant that this was the beginning of great things in his life, that this would be his niche, that by junior or senior year I\u2019d be attending state championships and even nationals with him, filming him as he won matches, cheering, crying with joy that he achieved success on his own terms. \u00a0I could see it happening. I could almost feel it. I wanted it for my son. But I knew that his first season would be a time of learning, since he hadn\u2019t wrestled before, and I had talked with him about not feeling bad if he lost a lot of matches his first season. I told him that I had heard from other parents that their sons lost a lot of matches their first season, but they just kept practicing, and by their second season, they were winning matches.\nThe season is now two-thirds of the way over, and he has not lost any matches. But that\u2019s because he hasn\u2019t been in any matches. He hasn\u2019t been in any tournaments. The only time he gets to actually wrestle is during practice. At least, that\u2019s what I thought.\nI picked him up from practice last week, as I usually do. He got in the car, I asked him how his day had been, and he said, \u201cFine,\u201d as he usually does. I pulled out of the parking lot and began driving home. And then he said something that made me want to sob.\n\u201cI think there must be an odd number of people on the team, because whenever it\u2019s time to pair up for practice, I always end up without a partner.\u201d\nHe had said it with trust and diplomacy, without blame, and without self-pity. But I could hear his underlying disappointment. I could hear the frustration he\u2019d learned to suppress from years \u2013 a lifetime \u2013 of being left out. Of not being understood. Not being accepted.\nA few weeks ago, it was proposed by his case manager and the coach that we reduce his time at daily practice because he was complaining of being too tired to do his school work, and I had agreed. But I didn\u2019t know that he was being excluded\u00a0during practice, and I wondered how long it had been going on. I took a deep breath.\n\u201cHave you talked to the coach about it?\u201d I asked. As much as I want to jump in and be mama bear, I am trying to hold back and give him the support to advocate for himself.\n\u201cYes. But I don\u2019t remember what he said.\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe you could talk to him about it again, and suggest to him that if there is an odd-numbered amount of people, that perhaps a few could rotate. Since you leave early, you could work with someone first, and then when you leave, the other person would get their turn.\u201d\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he said with interest. \u201cI think that would work.\u201d\n\u00a0*\nFive days later, I ask Nigel if he\u2019d talked to the coach again, and if he\u2019d been getting a partner at practice.\n\u201cYes, for a little while,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m starting to think that this being thrown around all the time is too hard on my body. Wrestling\u2019s not how I thought it would be.\u201d\nThis is new information, and part of me suspects that he\u2019s trying to talk himself out of wrestling because he hasn\u2019t been in any matches or tournaments. I remind him that the first season is a learning season for everyone, and ask him if he would like me to talk to the coach about making sure that he gets to do at least one match before the season is over. He declines my offer. I remind him that he\u2019d been wanting to do this since he was a little kid.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I did it. I wanted to be on the high school wrestling team, and I am. That\u2019s all I really wanted to do, besides inventing a time machine and being the first human on Mars.\u201d\nAnd it hits me \u2013 he just wanted to be on the team. That was his dream. Not finding his niche, or going to state championships or nationals \u2013 those were my dreams. And as long as he\u2019s happy that he followed his dream, that\u2019s all I really care about. I put my arm around him and tell him how proud I am of him. I ask him if he\u2019d like to continue practicing the remaining four weeks of the season.\n\u201cNo. I just don\u2019t think wrestling\u2019s my sport. It\u2019s too painful. But I\u2019m glad I tried it, despite the fact that it wasn\u2019t what I thought it would be.\u201d\nI tell him that I\u2019m glad that he tried it too, and then we go over what he should say when he calls the coach to tell him that he\u2019s not going to do wrestling anymore. I remind Nigel that he should tell the coach thank you\u00a0for the opportunity to be on the team, and that it meant a lot to him.\nIt meant a lot to me, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2009/11/20/a-little-boys-dream.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/01/17/a-little-boys-dream-part-2/", "title": "A Little Boy\u2019s Dream, Part 2"},
{"date": "January 12, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tDear Nigel\u2019s Teacher, \u00a0\nAt the Scout meeting on Saturday, I know that you were laughing good-naturedly when Nigel worded something in an awkward way, and that you didn\u2019t mean any harm, but I wanted to clarify for you what I said in response, because, as his teacher, it\u2019s important for you to know. Nigel did not start talking until he was five years old, and the process from that point on was very difficult for him. I described this in the information sheets that I gave to all of his teachers at the IEP meeting in September in the hopes that his teachers would be patient and understanding when he has difficulty expressing himself verbally. This is one of the many ways that his autism affects him. \u00a0\nWhen I said, \u201cHe does the best he can,\u201d in response to your laughter, I meant that sometimes he is unable to formulate his word choice in a typical way, but he tries. He has always had difficulty using pronouns correctly. Sometimes he states something that\u2019s obvious. Sometimes what he says can sound odd or off-the-wall to others, but he cannot help\u00a0it, just as\u00a0[another student]\u00a0cannot help it when he stutters. When\u00a0[the other student]\u00a0stuttered at the meeting, no one laughed. And I really hope that when Nigel says something in the classroom that is obvious or might not\u00a0make sense that you do not laugh in response. This sets a negative example for his peers,\u00a0many of whom have bullied him in the past. This is why I had homeschooled him previously. It would be\u00a0very upsetting\u00a0if the bullying started again, as it would affect Nigel\u2019s academics negatively along with his well-being. \u00a0\nAs I said, I know you did not mean any harm by laughing. I just wanted to make sure you realize that he cannot help it if he says something awkward. He has always tried so hard to communicate, and when he says something that doesn\u2019t sound right, he shouldn\u2019t be laughed at. Thank you for the work that you do as a teacher, and for your patience with my son. I know that a student with autism can be more difficult to teach, and I do appreciate all of your efforts. \u00a0\nSincerely, \u00a0\nTanya Savko\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/01/12/an-open-letter-to-my-sons-teacher/", "title": "An Open Letter to My Son\u2019s Teacher"},

But if you tried to pull it apart really fast, it wouldn\u2019t stretch. It would snap.\nSometimes I feel a lot like Silly Putty, trying to stretch to accommodate all of the elements of my life. But I think that the hardest part for me, besides my sons\u2019 father living far away, is being pulled in two directions trying to meet the needs of both of my boys. I feel like I\u2019m just stretching and stretching. Most of the time, I can keep stretching, and I do. But sometimes, too many things that require my attention happen at once, and I reach a breaking point.\nTake last weekend, for example. Nearly all day Saturday was spent doing Nigel\u2019s Boy Scout event with recycling Christmas trees. We got home from that, I made dinner, cleaned up after dinner, and started doing some work that was due for a client. I figured I could finish it by Sunday afternoon before heading out to the animal shelter to do the weekly volunteer work that Nigel needs for a Scout requirement. Then we\u2019d get home, I\u2019d make dinner, fill out some paperwork that needed to be done, and that would be the end of the weekend. No down time. I felt really stretched. \u00a0\nSo I was sitting at my computer, working on some spreadsheets, and Aidan walked in to ask me to take him to the mall tomorrow so that he could trade in some old video games and get a new one. I sighed, trying to avoid snapping. I felt like I was being pulled apart too fast. I started to complain about how busy I was, being gone all day at the Scout thing and having work to do, and the animal shelter tomorrow, and more work, and . . . Aidan\u2019s face fell. He started to walk away.\nAnd then it hit me. Again. I do so much for Nigel. He requires so much of my focus and time. And Aidan asks for so little. How could I not do this for him? All I needed to do was stretch a little more, to make a little time for my second son, who so often feels like second fiddle.\n\u201cWait, honey,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll be able to fit it in. We\u2019ll go right after Nigel and I get back from the animal shelter. And after the mall, we\u2019ll go out to dinner, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Thanks, Mom,\u201d he said, his face brightening some.\nAnd that is what we did. Sunday afternoon, Nigel and I got back from the animal shelter, and Aidan had his bag of old games all ready to go. I changed my clothes for dinner, then we drove to the mall and exchanged Aidan\u2019s games for the new game that he wanted, and he was happy. We went to the restaurant, and Nigel, without prompting, actually thanked the waiter when his plate was set in front of him. That\u2019s twice in one weekend, for anyone keeping track!\nAnd I\u2019m so glad that I stretched myself a little more. It\u2019s often a huge challenge doing this on my own, but it\u2019s worth it to keep stretching. It\u2019s worth it to make sure Aidan knows that he\u2019s also my priority. Fortunately, I\u2019m a lot like Silly Putty. When it snaps, you can easily connect the two ends together again.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/01/15/stretching/", "title": "Stretching"},

{"date": "January 21, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nIt\u2019s time once again for another edition of Personal Posts! Some might recall that I started this series of posts back in November and, well, I started it. I haven\u2019t written any additional posts on it since, and I figured it was time. Because, you know, I have such an exciting life and all.\nWhen we last left off, I was not dating, and that is still the case. My co-workers and I recently had a good laugh over some headline we read that Kate Gosselin, with her new long \u2018do, wants to start dating again, and I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t have time to date with two kids; how is she going to date with eight?!\u201d But I\u2019m thinking that summer might be a good time for me to try. That gives me ample time to finish up some projects and grow my hair back out. I had my hair cut a couple of weeks ago, and even though I went to the same stylist who\u2019s been doing my hair for about five years, and even though I brought a photo of myself with the cut that she did last time that I loved, she wasn\u2019t able to replicate it. It turned out completely different, and way shorter than what I asked for. And since, unlike Kate, I\u2019m not into hair extensions, I\u2019ll just have to wait a few months for it to grow out.\nNext up is something I\u2019m truly excited about \u2013 my plans to gradually switch to what\u2019s called a raw vegan diet, or simply, raw foods. Back in September, I realized that I never felt that great. I felt like every morning I had to drag myself out of bed and had so little mental and emotional energy. I wasn\u2019t sick, but I didn\u2019t feel completely well. I had found out about the raw food diet through one of my clients at work, Raw Family Publishing, a year and a half ago, but at the time it wasn\u2019t something I felt compelled to pursue. In September, I felt drawn to research raw foods due to my low energy level, and I read 12 Steps to Raw Foods. An entire chapter was dedicated to the subject of increased energy as a result of eating raw foods, along with many other positive effects. This is it! I thought. This is what I need to do!\nBut I knew that such a huge lifestyle change would need to be gradual for me. There are people who go 100% raw all at once, but I knew that wouldn\u2019t work for me since I have two teenagers for whom I still need to cook. So I decided to start off with my breakfast and make that completely raw by drinking green smoothies every morning. I bought a Vita-Mix high speed blender (an investment, but worth it), and since the first week of November, I\u2019ve had them every day. I\u2019m convinced that when I was sick last month it would have been much worse if I\u2019d not had my daily green smoothies. I\u2019m addicted to them and cannot start my day without them! Since I asked Nigel and Aidan to be supportive, they humor me and refrain from making comments (especially the one who thought it would be a good idea to make a pizza smoothie). So I\u2019ve got the raw breakfast down pat, and I\u2019m slowly working my way toward a raw lunch, which I hope to accomplish in the next couple of weeks. Eventually, when I\u2019m 100% raw, I\u2019m excited to see if the amazing results I\u2019ve read about will happen for me, like increased energy and time, two rare commodities around here.\nThe progress on publishing my book came to a grinding halt when the holidays hit, and if I don\u2019t get back to it soon I won\u2019t be able to live with myself. Unfortunately, this time of year is my busiest with my second job, which is seasonal. For my primary job, I am an account manager for a fulfillment company. One of my accounts is a music label with about 50 artists, and for my second job, I do their semesterly royalty calculations and statements. I\u2019m about neck-deep in spreadsheets now. So, my friends, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to cut back on posting and blogging (wah!) for a bit until I meet my deadline (meh).\nIf I can, I\u2019ll pop in every now and then with a Nigelism or something, like yesterday when he got home from school and decided to take inventory of all the clocks in the house \u2013 his watch, everybody\u2019s alarm clocks, the living room clock, the microwave clock, and whichever ones I\u2019m forgetting.

I blanched at the thought.\nAs I have mentioned before, I feel semi-comfortable with him riding alone around the suburban neighborhood in which we live. I know, I know. He\u2019s thirteen years old, for God\u2019s sake. Let the kid ride his bike. But this particular thirteen-year-old kid, even though he can talk now, still has sensory issues which can compromise his safety (and possibly the safety of others). What happens if a commercial truck drives right next to him and the rumbling (roaring, to him)\u00a0of it jars him enough to make him wobble, hit the curb, and fall into the path of the truck? Or, if he appears to not be paying attention, the driver of the truck, or any vehicle, could sound their loud horn to alert him, and it would startle him enough to make him lose control of his bike and veer into traffic.\nThen there are the flying insects. At any time while walking, if any flying insect, from a tiny gnat to a huge moth, happens to come near Nigel, he immediately begins violently shaking his head, flinging his arms around, and running away. This cannot happen on a bike on a busy street.\nSo I talked to Nigel about my truck concerns, about holding his line so that he does not wobble too close to traffic (\u201cI hold my line,\u201d he said in his deadpan voice), and about insects flying in his face. That sobered\u00a0him for a moment, and I could see the wheels turning. Then he said, \u201cWe just need to extinguish bees with stingers. Or make flightless bees.\u201d Flightless bees.

Yet he has this fascination for\u00a0history and a photographic memory when it comes to names,\u00a0dates, and events that\u00a0makes\u00a0me think this passion needs to be\u00a0encouraged.\u00a0\nToday after homeschool we went to the library, where Nigel picked up some videos on horses, the human body, Secrets of the Mummy, and Thomas Edison. Then we went to our local grocery store where I picked up a few items while he went to the video section to try to find Disney\u2019s Donald in Mathemagic Land. They didn\u2019t have it, but they did have the old live-action Treasure Island, so he got that instead, saying, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this in a while.\u201d\nWe got home and got ourselves some lunch (he did his usual grazing approach: two pieces of bread, a pear, an apple, a cup of yogurt, and I put some tortilla chips in a pan and melted some cheese on top). Nigel took his lunch to eat in the living room while he started Treasure Island, and I sat at the kitchen counter reading WordPress for Dummies while I ate.\nAfter about ten minutes, out of nowhere, Nigel called out from the living room, \u201cMom, you were born in a period of economic inflation.\u201d\nMe: Yes, I suppose I was.\nThat was all. \u00a0He often leaves me hanging like that. I suppose I could have asked him why he mentioned that at that moment, but\u00a0I was too caught up in marveling at his sentence structure and didn\u2019t want to stop his train of thought, wherever it was going. Sometimes I wonder if all of his musings might come out on paper some day, along with his analysis and theories about humanity. He strikes this amazing balance between attachment (to those he loves) and detachment (from social mores and historical events) that I really think he\u00a0might possess\u00a0an innate ability to look objectively at a situation (historical or otherwise) and see what\u2019s really going on.\u00a0I know, I\u2019m making some assumptions here, maybe asserting my own biased observation, projecting that my son could be some amazing social analyst because of his autism.\nBut I was born in 1971, and I can\u2019t remember when I had last mentioned that around him. He filed it away, along with whatever he had previously read about inflation, and somehow the two\u00a0topics combined in his\u00a0head while he was watching Treasure Island. His mind fascinates me.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/04/04/nigel-the-historian/", "title": "Nigel the Historian"},
{"date": "April 3, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tBrain wave therapy is truly amazing. It can heal illness, stop problem behavior, increase productivity and creativity, induce sleep, optimize learning and memory,\u00a0aid in\u00a0relaxation and stress release, and creates a meditative environment.\u00a0Kelly Howell at\u00a0Brainsync.com, a leader in brain wave technology, offers this description of brain wave therapy:\nFirst discovered by biophysicist Gerald Oster at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, brain wave audio technology sends pure, precisely tuned sound waves of different frequencies to your brain via stereo headphones. In his EEG research, Oster discovered that when different vibrations, or sound frequencies, are delivered to the brain separately through each ear (as with stereo headphones), the two hemispheres of the brain function together to \u201chear\u201d not the external sound signals, but a third phantom signal. This signal is called a binaural beat, and it pulses at the exact mathematical difference between the two actual tones.\nWith Brain Sync programs, the binaural beat is then embedded in soothing music, helping the listener to easily attain the alternate brain wave pattern. The result is 30 or 60 minutes of peaceful meditation while your body and mind benefit from the healing frequencies.\nI love Brain Sync\u2019s programs, particularly Positive Thinking, Create Success, Deep Meditation, Deep Insight, Brain Massage, Ecstasy, Relieve Jet Lag, and Awakening Kundalini. I recently gave Mind Body Healing to my father, who is undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer. Last year, a friend of mine who worked nights benefitted from Healing Sleep. The programs are highly effective.\nAnd so I am wanting to have Nigel\u00a0try\u00a0brain wave therapy.\u00a0Regarding using brain wave therapy with children, Brain Sync maintains\u00a0\u201cBrain wave centered programs are intended for adults only and are strongly not recommended for babies or children under the age of 15, as their brains are still developing.\u00a0 If brainwave therapy is used for a child, it should be under the care, advisement and supervision of a healthcare professional.\u201d \nWith that in mind, I decided to do some online research in the area of brain wave therapy, also called neurofeedback, and autism treatment, and found some positive articles. Bio-and neurofeedback programs involve equipment that\u00a0monitors and measures the brain\u2019s electrical activity\u00a0instead of using the audio recordings of binaural beats embedded in music (like Brain Sync\u2019s programs), but the\u00a0goal is the same: to retrain, strengthen, and calm the brain through brain wave patterns.\nHere is what I found at Autism-home.com about using neurofeedback to treat autism:\n\n\n\nA consultant to EEG Spectrum International, Inc., which developed the software and hardware interfaces for Neurotherapy and developed training courses for appropriate clinicians, Dr. Jarusiewicz also runs a non-profit organization, Atlantic Research Institute, Inc. A.R.I. develops and manages research projects using Neurotherapy, particularly in the area of autism, learning disabilities, disordered brain issues as well as addiction. Her study on the use of Neurotherapy has been published by the peer-reviewed journal, Journal of Neurotherapy, Volume 6(4), 2002. The results were impressive. She showed with statistical significance a change (lessening) of autism behaviors by 26% in an average of 36 sessions over 4.5 months. This was compared with a control group that used conventional methods of changing behaviors that achieved 3% change. All major issues improved for all children trained: speech, schoolwork, tantrums, socialization, anxiety and depression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Betty is now working on a pilot project to enable parents of autistic children to conduct neurofeedback from home, with the help of a licensed clinician. She is also conducting a clinical trial for FDA approval for use of neurofeedback specifically for use in the autistic spectrum, which is in the planning and development stages.\n\n\n\nThis particular article was written in reference to an 8-year-old boy, so it sounds like age was not a factor for them. I have decided to\u00a0have Nigel start with a Brain Sync program soon,\u00a0and I will certainly post his progress here as we go. I\u2019m\u00a0optimistic!\n\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.brainsync.com/pilot.asp?pg=default&affiliate=286530", "http://www.brainsync.com/product.asp?specific=140&affiliate=286530", "http://www.brainsync.com/product.asp?specific=144&affiliate=286530", "http://www.brainsync.com/product.asp?specific=172&affiliate=286530", "http://www.brainsync.com/product.asp?specific=131&affiliate=286530", "http://www.brainsync.com/product.asp?specific=129&affiliate=286530", "http://www.brainsync.com/product.asp?specific=136&affiliate=286530", "http://www.brainsync.com/product.asp?specific=150&affiliate=286530", "http://www.brainsync.com/product.asp?specific=151&affiliate=286530", "http://www.brainsync.com/product.asp?specific=154&affiliate=286530", "http://www.brainsync.com/product.asp?specific=155&affiliate=286530", "http://www.autism-home.com/autism-neurofeedback.shtml"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/04/03/brain-wave-therapy/", "title": "Brain Wave Therapy"},

All day long I was wondering why he was being so difficult: irritable, non-compliant with any little thing, lashing out, complaining, and then, sometime after dinner, it hit me. I had forgotten to give him his medication that morning.\nIt was good to note that the Zoloft really does make a difference for him. I had already forgotten (or probably blocked the memories of) how he had been the months prior to medicating him. His anxiety level was so high that he was constantly irritated and often lashed out. I remember one afternoon going into his room and noticing that his desk chair (the kind with the adjustable, pedestal-supported seat on rollers,\u00a0with a curved metal bar covered in ribbed plastic connecting the seat and the chair back) had been broken. He had ripped off the chair back, wrenching it\u00a0off of the bolts that connected it to the curved bar. I tried to fix it, but the damage was beyond repair. I ended up removing the curved bar so that the chair is now just a rolling seat with no back.\nI asked Nigel what had happened to the chair. He said in\u00a0a low voice, \u201cIt was because of my anger. I feel\u00a0different from everyone. I have a defective brain because of the a-word.\u201d\nHe has referred to autism as \u201cthe a-word\u201d for a few years now, ever since he asked \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d and I told him about autism. That day with the vandalized chair in front of us, I assured him, as I have on so many occasions, that his brain is not defective, it\u2019s just wired differently. I reminded him that he has a very good brain that taught him to read at age three and a half. He seemed to feel a little better.\nBut since going on Zoloft almost two months ago, he has not destroyed anything because of self-esteem issues. He is more relaxed, more comfortable in his skin. He sleeps better. He no longer eats his hair. He doesn\u2019t talk about his brain being defective. He is happier, I think. It pained me to think of him breaking his belongings because he feels angry about being different, that his self-esteem should suffer because of autism. If Zoloft can alleviate any of that, then I\u2019m sticking with it. Nigel never balks at taking it. It makes me\u00a0wonder if he notices the difference in how he feels. I think he does. He just isn\u2019t able to put it into words.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/04/07/medication-check-in/", "title": "Medication Check-in"},

{"date": "April 10, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tEither I picked the wrong day to cut Nigel\u2019s hair, or he picked the wrong day to want to print out 29 pages of pi. That\u2019s right \u2013 he found a website with a link to print out 29 pages\u2019 worth of 3.14. As I was setting up the hair-cutting station in the kitchen (having prepared him verbally for two weeks), he came running into the room and in an uncharacteristic, excited tone said, \u201cI\u2019m printing out all of pi!\u201d\nIn retrospect,\u00a0I should have let him do it. It\u2019s just that, on my reduced income with homeschooling him, I can\u2019t afford to be buying ink cartridges every week. I ran into his room, shut off the printer, and canceled the print job while he screeched at me. Then I tried to explain to him about using up ink in the printer, and that he should check with me before printing out anything over five pages. He began smacking his forehead with the back of his hand and making angry growling noises.\nI always talk about how I \u201cpick\u00a0my battles\u201d with my kids, and how I weigh if something is worth an uproar or not. I\u2019m thinking that perhaps 29 pages of ink was not worth it. I should have let him print out pi. However, I didn\u2019t want to \u201cchange my mind\u201d midstream, mid-uproar, and have\u00a0Nigel think that if he screeched and growled and hit himself that he could get what he wanted in the future. So finally I got him to calm down by pointing out to him that if he printed out pi, there would be no more ink to print out his zoopraxiscope templates (Obsession of the Week).\nThen I faced the formidable task of getting him to let me cut his hair. I really wish he could just let it grow long, but, out of boredom during Spring Break, he began pulling it out again (although not eating it, much to my relief), so I told him it had to be cut. Since his first haircut at the age of three, he has hated haircuts. He has an unrelenting fear that his ears will be cut, coupled with sensory issues that made him unable to bear the vibrating clippers. For many years we did not use clippers at all, only scissors. But that was before he started pulling out his hair, and at that point we needed to cut it as close as possible. Especially since we wanted to put off having to do it again for as long as we could. So now I use the clippers, after having him slowly get used to it, and he always puts earplugs in. I keep a set in the same box as the clippers so they\u2019re always there.\nNigel used to shriek when I\u2019d cut his hair, and for years I feared that Child Protective Services would come banging on my door. In fact, I\u2019m surprised they never did. It\u2019s one of those things about the early years that I am so glad to have behind us. Now when I cut Nigel\u2019s hair, he certainly lets me know he doesn\u2019t like it, but he doesn\u2019t scream and thrash around. He lets me do it, although he lectures me each time not to cut his ears (I never have, so he\u2019s not drawing on any past experience), and he constantly shrinks away from the clippers, making the job very difficult.\nAnd this time, he was angry because I hadn\u2019t let him print out his 29 pages of pi. He kept making sounds like a snorting horse as he sat in the seat while I cut his hair, forcefully saying, \u201cHey! Watch it!\u201d every minute or so. \u00a0But he let me do it. I wasn\u2019t sure at first if he would. He was resisting me as I tried to guide him to the chair in the kitchen and tie the plastic cape around his neck and sit him down. I could tell he was still mad at me.\nBut maybe\u00a0Nigel has his own take on picking battles. Maybe somehow he sensed that a) this was something he knew was coming, b) I\u2019d cut his hair many times before and it really wasn\u2019t that big of a deal anymore, and c) making threats about not doing the cat litter if I don\u2019t let him do what he wants to do never works, and he better just sit down and get this over with. He\u2019s learned to\u00a0save his big stands for the things that really matter to him. Like printing out\u00a0two pages of\u00a0instructions to make a neat invention instead of 29 pages of numbers.

It did not go over well, and Nigel\u2019s self-beratement matched Aidan\u2019s exasperation. Fortunately, I had a spare keyboard in the closet, leftover from when I got my new computer last year and had opted to use my cordless ergonomic keyboard. But the spare keyboard\u00a0needed the newer USB port, which the kids\u2019 six-year-old computer did not have, so it wouldn\u2019t work.\u00a0\nVoila! I found an adapter! I plugged the USB cable into the adapter and put the adapter into the old, round keyboard plug on the back of their computer. Still nothing! The adapter turned out to be for the mouse port!! Then I thought to look at my old corded ergonomic keyboard, and it had the right plug \u2013 the old round kind! I plugged it in, feeling premature triumph, and then . . . nothing! I\u2019m guessing that their brand of computer, Microtel, is not compatible with Microsoft accessories. Who could have guessed that the two spare keyboards I bothered to save would not work at all when needed? What a wasted effort!\nMeanwhile, Nigel had taken apart the old keyboard that he had spilled the water on (he asked me first if he could), and it was in about 95 pieces spread out all over the living room floor. I took a deep breath and went online to see if I could find any Microtel keyboards. I found one, but of course it was new, so it had a USB plug instead of the old round kind. So then I started looking for a whole new freaking computer, since we need\u00a0a computer\u00a0for homeschool work. Gah!!\nIn the midst of that, the boys\u2019 father called, so I told him what happened, and he said that he had some high school buddy who refurbished old computers and that he\u2019d give him a call. I decided to start making dinner, and once again yelled out to anyone within earshot that they are to never have food or drinks around the computer. Ever!\nAfter dinner, Nigel matter-of-factly stated that the keyboard was completely dry and he had put it back together. I had thought that he was going to take it apart to play with the parts, but he had taken it apart to dry it out. Aidan matter-of-factly suggested that they try plugging it back in to see if it would work now that it was dry. I said, \u201cGo ahead and try, but it probably won\u2019t work.\u201d\nIt worked. The damn thing actually worked.\nNigel said, matter-of-factly but with an unmistakable surge of self-esteem, \u201cI used my resourcefulness.\u201d He never ceases to amaze me. Here I thought I was being resourceful by saving the spare keyboards and trying the adapter and researching to find a replacement. I had just assumed that the keyboard would no longer work.\u00a0 Sometimes I just need to be reminded to fix what is broken. That should be the first step in being resourceful. That and not making any assumptions \u2013 about things or people, and what they\u2019re capable of accomplishing.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/04/13/resourcefulness/", "title": "Resourcefulness"},
{"date": "April 12, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nEverybody Is Different , by Fiona Bleach, is a fantastic little book. At around 75 pages, it\u2019s perfectly accessible for kids, as the subtitle indicates: A book for young people who have brothers or sisters with autism.\u00a0 It\u2019s written mostly in a question/answer format, divided into\u00a0six parts: general information about autism, main characteristics of autism, odd behaviour (the author is English, hence the alternate spelling), sibling feelings, therapy and help, and a glossary at the end. It also features\u00a0cute little\u00a0illustrations by the author.\nThe book tackles some difficult questions, such as \u201cWhy do some people have autism?\u201d, answering them in a way that kids can understand, without being too simplistic. One of the book\u2019s strengths is that it\u00a0not only answers questions, it also makes\u00a0a point of\u00a0discussing how the NT sibling feels and what they can do about it. This includes dealing with such emotions as anger, resentment, frustration, sadness, and embarrassment.\nMy younger son, Aidan,\u00a0and I have consulted the book many times regarding various subjects and found it to be helpful and encouraging. Aidan benefitted from reading about why his brother makes strange noises, why he says and does the same things over and over again, why he throws or breaks things, and why he hurts himself. The book also listed some good tips for maintaining privacy\u00a0and how to respond to an autistic sibling who doesn\u2019t know what that means.\nOf the many attributes of Everybody Is Different, one that really stands out is the encouragement of\u00a0NT siblings to talk with their parents and\u00a0friends about how they feel.\u00a0I also appreciated the positive suggestions for interacting with autistic siblings and explaining their behavior to friends or others who are unfamiliar with them.

I happily scrunched it and clutched it every night of my life until there were literally just a few twisted threads left of it.\nI figured that my own children would also have their own security blankets, but they, doing their own thing from the beginning, preferred stuffed animals as their security items.

Volunteers give handmade blankets to various facilities and organizations for children who are seriously ill, traumatized, or otherwise in need.\nAnd I\u2019m very excited to say that the \u201cotherwise in need\u201d part now includes weighted blankets for children with Sensory Processing Disorder, including those on the autism spectrum. \u00a0Many local chapters are now featuring special handmade blankets with Velcro pockets, which have folded remnants of fabric placed inside to provide the weight. The fabric remnants are removable so that you can easily wash the blanket. You can also add more fabric remnants into the Velcro pockets if your child needs more weight in the blanket. These handmade weighted blankets are amazing works of love.\nClick here to find a Project Linus chapter near you.

{"date": "April 9, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tEvery family has different reasons why they choose to homeschool. Many do it for moral/ethical/religious reasons. Some do it simply because they love to spend as much time as possible with their children and want to be responsible for their education as well. Some do it out of necessity for the child. Our family\u2019s homeschool story, of course, falls into that last category.\nAbout seven years ago, I attended a special needs parenting workshop on IEP preparedness and advocacy guidelines. The moderator went around the room prompting all the participants to introduce themselves and mention their child\u2019s educational status. I vividly remember a woman seated by herself who explained in a tired but accepting voice that due to mainstreaming problems, she would need to\u00a0homeschool her twelve-year-old son who had Tourette Syndrome. At the time, I thought I could interpret the exhaustion on her face, the frustration, the resignation. I thought, because I was a single parent with an autistic six-year-old, that I knew how she felt. I remember at that moment being thankful because Nigel showed such great potential that I wouldn\u2019t need to consider homeschooling in the future. On some level, I didn\u2019t even want to consider it because I thought it was something I wouldn\u2019t be able to do. But now when I remember that woman\u2019s face and her voice, I comprehend on a deeper level what she conveyed at the meeting that night, seven years ago.\nThis is what I need to do for my son. I don\u2019t know how yet, but I will do it. I will make it work.\nI know this now because this is how I felt five months ago. Six months ago, as the school year was about to begin, Nigel asked me several times if I would homeschool him. At the time I had not even considered it an option, mostly because, as a single parent, I had to work. How could I homeschool him? I couldn\u2019t be the stay-at-home parent: I was the only parent!\nI will write in future posts about all the bullying and social problems Nigel experienced that made me decide to find a way to homeschool him. Within weeks of school starting, his already fragile status in a low-support mainstreaming situation had deteriorated to the point where I had begun to seriously think about homeschooling him. I started researching homeschooling websites in general and looked at our state\u2019s requirements for specific information. But I had no idea how to swing it financially.\nOpportunity knocks. I had been working at my job as account manager for an order fulfillment company for almost ten years. My boss walked\u00a0up to my desk\u00a0a few weeks\u00a0after I decided I would need to homeschool my son,\u00a0and she said that one of our clients, a music\u00a0label, was looking for someone to handle the\u00a0royalty calculations for their 45 artists. It was tedious accounting work, but it could be done from home, and did I know anyone who might be interested? My spine tingled; I hadn\u2019t told her yet that I needed to find a way to homeschool Nigel.\nI took the job. And after several weeks of hiring and training my replacement at the office, I begain homeschooling my son. I am so glad he asked me to do this. It is a dream come\u00a0true for both of us.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/04/09/our-homeschool-story/", "title": "Our Homeschool Story"},
{"date": "October 11, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tI have read and heard it said that we all have sensory issues to some degree. Whether you cut the tags out of your clothing, get a headache from fluorescent lights, cringe at the sound of a drill, or even still get carsick, you\u2019re exhibiting a mild symptom of SPD.\nBut sometimes it\u2019s not so mild. Sometimes your senses of taste, smell, and tactile processing are so affected that you can only eat a few foods. Sometimes your hearing is so sensitive that it\u2019s difficult for you to be in a classroom and filter everyone else\u2019s sounds \u2013 chairs scraping, pencils writing, kids talking, teachers raising their voices, bells ringing. And forget trying to function if the fire alarm goes off. Forget being able to filter a blender, drill, leaf blower, or air hand drier in a restroom. It\u2019s enough to make you scream. And quite often, because you can\u2019t talk and even if you knew how to cover your ears, it wouldn\u2019t be enough, you scream. You scream and you run. And if you can\u2019t run, you writhe on the floor, screaming in agony.\nAnd if you\u2019re a parent of a child who does that, you become ultra-aware of your child\u2019s triggers, or possible triggers. This is just one of the many reasons why\u00a0recent studies (sorry -can\u2019t seem to find the link right now) have indicated that some parents of children with autism\u00a0have PTSD, from years of being hyper-vigilant, stressed, and exhausted, among other reasons. You try to second-guess every situation. You instantly notice the echo-effect or noise\u00a0level of every environment\u00a0and hope that your child is okay with it. You cringe when you hear a loud mechanical noise. You still check for air hand driers every time you enter a restroom, even if your child is not with you.\nIn many cases, as the child gets older, they learn how to filter the sounds that used to be so agonizing to them. Sometimes, they get to a point where they only have to briefly plug their ears if a sound bothers them, instead of screaming and bolting in a panic. There is a huge reprieve as the parents feel safe to go out in public again.\nBut some parents \u2013 and I am one of them \u2013\u00a0are\u00a0still affected by\u00a0the\u00a0experience of having a child who screamed and bolted and writhed on the floor. Even though my son is almost fifteen and it\u2019s been several years since he reacted violently to a sensory issue, and even though I consciously know that he is fine now and would probably not have those reactions again, I still have these subconscious fears. Or maybe they\u2019re psychosomatic sensory issues. When we are in public and a mechanical device or appliance goes off, it\u2019s a trigger for me. Every sound is magnified. I almost break into a cold sweat. My adrenaline starts pumping and my pulse quickens. I become hyper-alert; I instantly look at my son. Often times, the sound doesn\u2019t appear to have fazed him. Or, if he noticed it, he merely covered his ears. Sometimes he might make a comment like \u201cThat was pretty loud.\u201d But that\u2019s it. He no longer screams or bolts, and he hasn\u2019t for a long time. \u00a0\nOn some level, it\u2019s like when I was in college and waited tables for my job. For years afterward, whenever I went out to eat at a restaurant, I couldn\u2019t relax. I was constantly aware of the wait staff, how many tables they had, how they hurried. I would feel nervous when I would see food sitting in the pass-through window, waiting to be brought out to the tables, like I should get up and do it. If someone dropped or broke something, my adrenaline would race through me. For years, even after I no longer waited tables, I didn\u2019t go out to eat much because I just couldn\u2019t enjoy myself.\nIt\u2019s been about sixteen years since I waited tables. And about a year ago, I was out a restaurant, and I noticed that I was relaxed. I wasn\u2019t watching the wait staff. I wasn\u2019t aware of the food coming out. I didn\u2019t think about timing. I didn\u2019t flinch when somebody dropped something. I realized that I was enjoying myself. So. Fifteen years. Fifteen years to get over the \u201ctrauma\u201d of waiting tables for four years.\nI don\u2019t remember the last time that my son reacted violently to a sensory issue. I remember many of the individual instances, but not all. I\u2019m sure that the times I\u2019ve forgotten are those that I\u2019ve mentally blocked, as a defense mechanism. But I can guess that it\u2019s been about five or six years since we\u2019ve dealt with a sensory meltdown. Since then, we\u2019ve had meltdowns for other reasons, of course, but not sensory-related. So if my track record holds, I\u2019ll need another nine or ten years to get over the\u00a0experience of having a screaming/bolting/writhing child.\nAnd while I know that this is nothing compared to the PTSD inflicted on many of those who serve our country, it is difficult for me. Time does heal. I just wish\u00a0there was something\u00a0I could do in the meantime. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/10/11/my-undiagnosed-ptsd/", "title": "My Undiagnosed PTSD"},
{"date": "October 15, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tRemember when the autism ribbon magnets came out? I do. I don\u2019t recall how many years ago that was, but I got some right away, gave a few to relatives, kept a couple. We didn\u2019t really think about the puzzle message back then, the \u201cI am not a puzzle\u201d outlook. And I totally get that; I do. But to me, it\u2019s not the person that\u2019s puzzling. I\u2019m sure most parents feel that way. And definitely some kids.\nAnyway, even though I always thought that the design was too busy and actually detracted from the message, I still sported one on the back of my car for several years, along with an \u201cI love a person with autism\u201d bumper sticker. As time went on, the bumper sticker peeled and faded considerably, but the magnet held strong. Years of carwashes, storms, uncovered parking, and road trips (we take a lot of those) did not affect it. That thing was baked on.\nAnd then, two months ago, I went through the carwash, the same carwash I\u2019ve been going through for years, and the magnet came off. I went to a store after the carwash, and when I came back to the car in the parking lot, I noticed that the magnet was gone. Just a little black piece of it was left behind, still baked on.\u00a0 I stood there for a moment, dejected. I always like to look for those whenever I\u2019m driving and get a feeling of pride and a little excitement when I see one. And now mine is gone. Sure, I can easily get another one, but it won\u2019t be my magnet, the one that has gone with us everywhere for the past seven years or something like that. I didn\u2019t want to replace it with another one.\nSo I decided it was time for something new. Finally motivated, I got going on something that I\u2019ve been thinking about doing for a while. I did some looking, tried out a few designs, and TA-DAH! I proudly present to you the all-new, puzzle-free Teen Autism bumper sticker!\n\nAnd because I thought there might be other parents out there looking for an awareness alternative for the family car, I made enough to share. Really! If you\u2019d like a sticker to let others know that you\u2019ve got an older child with ASD, just send an e-mail to Tanya@teenautism.com with your name and address. Or if you know of any teachers, therapists, or sped coordinators in your area who would be interested, let me know and I\u2019ll be happy to send one out for them.\nSeeing my car without the iconic ribbon magnet took some getting used to. But I must admit that I like my cool new sticker even better!\n\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/the-autism-awareness-bandit/", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FG9Z8W", "mailto:Tanya@teenautism.com"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/10/15/time-for-a-change/", "title": "Time for a Change"},
{"date": "October 20, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tRemember that post I wrote shortly before school started \u2013 the one about the three girls I had talked to one afternoon? No? That\u2019s okay. Go ahead and read it here. We have time.\nOver the past twelve years, I\u2019ve talked to a great number of people about autism. I\u2019ve talked to relatives, friends, neighbors, teachers, and complete strangers. I\u2019ve talked to parents at playgrounds, ice cream store employees, grocery checkers, and kids at bus stops. I\u2019ve even gone to a different country to talk about autism. And regardless of where or how or to whom, I always wonder if I\u2019ve said too much, if I haven\u2019t said enough, or if what I\u2019ve said made any difference. \nSometimes it does when I least expect it.\nAbout six weeks ago, my son started high school with a self-imposed vow to ride his bike to and from school every day. He had been practicing around the neighborhood for a few years, and I believed he was ready to do it, even though the idea made my heart race. The day before school started, we did a dry run with him riding his bike to school and me following in my car, about a hundred yards behind. In a previous post, I described how I saw him ride past three teenage girls, and how I saw the girls mimic him with exaggerated gestures, laughing. I quelled my anger and made a split-second decision to pull up to them, roll down the window, and politely, diplomatically let them know that my son has autism. The girls seemed receptive, albeit embarrassed. I didn\u2019t really say much, and I wasn\u2019t sure what good it would do. In fact, I just thought, Three people \u2013 a drop in the bucket. But I also realized that getting those three people on our side might make even a slight difference.\nWeeks pass. Things are mostly okay at school and the bike-riding is going well, to my ultimate relief. I come home from work on a hectic Wednesday and rush around to get a few things done before my two boys get home from school. Minutes later, my younger son waltzes through the front door, his bus on time. He hurries to remove his confining shoes and greets me. He goes to the kitchen to get a snack. I look at the shed in the backyard to see if my firstborn is putting his bike away yet, since the boys usually get home within minutes of each other. Not yet. I sit on the couch and pretend to nonchalantly read a magazine. Fifteen minutes pass, and my anxiety continues to rise. I get up and decide to go look for him. I jump as the phone rings, pounce on it. Thank God, thank God, it is my son. He has remembered to use the new pre-paid cell phone that is in his backpack. He tells me in his flat voice that there is a problem with his bike. \u201cDid a car hit you?\u201d I gasp. \n\u201cNo. The rear tube and tire are falling off. Could you come and pick me up?\u201d\nOh, wonderful words. Beautiful sentence structure. Impressive problem-solving. Blessed safety!\n\u201cYes, yes, of course. Where are you?\u201d\n\u201cIn front of the elementary school.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m getting in the car right now. I\u2019ll be there in just a few minutes.\u201d\nA block from the elementary school, I see him, walking his bike while holding the handle bars. And then I realize that there is a girl walking beside him. I do not know her name, but I instantly recognize her. She is one of the three girls. Yes. I almost don\u2019t believe it. Awareness in action.\nI turn up the block before them and park the car. I get out, wanting to thank her for walking with my son, but as soon as she sees my car, she immediately gets on her cell phone and crosses the street. I get the awkward vibe \u2013 she wants to help, but she is still a little embarrassed by her previous behavior. I don\u2019t want to make her feel uncomfortable, so I let it go. I thank her in my mind, send her the appreciation vibe.\nI open up the back of my small SUV, and my son walks over with his bike. I praise him for remembering to call me, and together we remove one of the bike\u2019s wheels so that we can fit it in the car. Afterward, we get in and I ask him if the girl had been walking with him long. \u201cNot too long,\u201d he says. \u201cBut she was nice.\u201d\nOh, yes. When you least expect it.

All things considered, we are more flexible and have fewer expectations than we did last year.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have plans for you. On the contrary, we\u2019ve got some big plans! But what\u2019s different from last year is that we\u2019re not limiting ourselves to our own expectations. You see, I learned something this past year. In my letter to 2009, I wrote that, among other things, we were expecting a \u201cproblem-free trip to the Grand Canyon.\u201d We did make that trip, and aside from an attack of acrophobia and a massive bloody nose inside the Canyon, it was \u201cproblem-free.\u201d But what I couldn\u2019t have foreseen when I wrote the letter was that I would have the opportunity to embark on another trip last summer. I would journey to Nepal for two weeks to work with families with autism, and it would be one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. There was no way I could have expected that wonderful trip to happen! In addition to that, there were countless other experiences throughout the year that have enhanced our lives and helped us to learn what we needed to know, whether we expected them or not.\nAnd so, 2010, I\u2019m leaving my expectations open this year. I\u2019ve learned that things can turn out way better than I could have ever planned or expected.\u00a0 Yes, we\u2019ll still make plans and set goals and do our best to achieve them. And if things don\u2019t work out the way we plan, that\u2019s okay. We know that you\u2019ve got something lined up that will work out even better. So, Welcome, 2010! We\u2019re really looking forward to seeing what you have in store for us.\nBest wishes,\nThe Teen Autism Household\nHappy New Year, everyone!\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/01/01/an-open-letter-to-2010/", "title": "An Open Letter to 2010"},
{"date": "October 13, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tLong-time readers of this blog know that Nigel unfortunately has a history of being bullied (click here and scroll down). So far, at his new school, he has not encountered any bullying or harassment, which is a welcome relief for both of us. But I am not one to sit back and take things for granted. No, not I. I am a planner, a preparer. A what-if-it-happens-againer.\nAnd so, last week I attended a seminar on bullying intervention strategies hosted by ORPTI. They are a fantastic organization that presents parent training workshops throughout the state of Oregon. Last year, I attended their incredibly helpful and informative Autism & Puberty seminar. Other workshop topics include IEPs, early intervention, transitions, behavior, and many more. I highly encourage any Oregon residents to sign up for ORPTI\u2019s e-mail mailing list, and you will receive notifications of upcoming workshops in your area, which is exactly how I found out about the one on bullying.\nBeing the seasoned parent of a child who\u2019s experienced every type of bullying known to bullydom, the information in the first half of the seminar was not new to me. But parents of younger special needs kids would definitely benefit from the topics that had been presented, including how to recognize the different types of bullying, the difference between teasing and bullying and when teasing is not teasing, the myths surrounding bullying, the causes, how to help your child to not be a target, how to talk to your child about bullying, school policies on bullying, dealing with parent reactions to bullying, how to decide appropriate strategies to address bullying, and being involved at school. These are all things that I have years of experience in doing, unfortunately.\nBut what I don\u2019t know enough about \u2013 and the main reason why I attended this seminar \u2013 is what to do when you\u2019ve tried every single strategy and your child is still being bullied and the school is doing nothing about it. I can tell you this \u2013 it does not feel good. That much I know. I\u2019ve been there. Like a cornered cat, I hissed for a while and then summoned all my strength and jumped the wall behind me to get out of that situation, and I took my son with me. That was when we started homeschooling, which was almost two years ago. I knew that it would be temporary (thank God \u2013 as a single parent, my bank account couldn\u2019t take it for very long), but it was what we both needed. My son begged for help, I could no longer fight the school, and I didn\u2019t know what else to do. Now, after attending the bullying seminar, I do.\nIn my opinion, schools focus far too much on \u201cfixing\u201d the ASD kid and not enough, if any, on the bullies. They put the ASD kids in social skills class, role-play with them, and teach them how to respond when bullied. But do they teach disability awareness to their peers? They teach Internet safety, birth control, recycling, and other non-academic subjects. So why not awareness? I kept asking and pleading for the school to teach my son\u2019s peers about autism, the Regional Autism Consultant was more than willing to do it, and the school never scheduled it. At the seminar I attended last week, I learned how to make that happen: you write it into the IEP. \u201cWhere?\u201d I asked, wondering why I hadn\u2019t thought of that before. In the \u201crelated services\u201d section. Just like that.\nOf course, it\u2019s rarely that simple. So I was very glad when the workshop presented some helpful forms on taking things to the next level \u2013 notifying school administrators and then the district offices, higher if you need to. I found the online versions of information that all special needs parents should have. Click here for 10 Steps to Notifying School Administrators of Harassment Concerns, scroll down to the Handouts section, and click \u201cNotifying School Administrators\u201d to get the PDF. For another helpful PDF on disabilities and harassment, click here and scroll down to the Special Education section. Click \u201cWhat Can You Do If Your Child with a Disability Is Being Harassed by Other Students?\u201d for the PDF.\nThe bottom line is that when bullying is targeted at someone with a disability, it\u2019s not only mean, it\u2019s discrimination. And the more we know about what we can do, the better we will be able to advocate for our kids.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://orpti.org/", "http://pacer.org/publications/bullying.asp", "http://www.elc-pa.org/pubs/pubs_disabilities.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/10/13/after-the-fixing/", "title": "After the Fixing"},
{"date": "October 22, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nWhen I was in college, my roommates and I hosted a P-Funk party that people still talk about. We dressed up and wore wigs. We played records (yes, records) and really got down. But that\u2019s not the kind of funk I\u2019m into now. A few months ago, my two teen boys invited some friends over (more teen boys) for a sleepover, and the next morning, as they slept and I walked into the game room to survey the damage (almost as wild as my P-Funk party), I was hit with a wall of funk. Teenage-boy funk. Sweat, dirty socks, and (um, how to put this delicately?) expelled-air kind of funk.\nBut that\u2019s not the kind of funk I\u2019m in now. You know the kind, I\u2019m sure \u2013 things are going mostly okay, you\u2019re working, taking care of the kids and the household, but something doesn\u2019t feel right. And in spite of all that\u2019s good in your life, in spite of counting your blessings, it\u2019s still hard. Right \u2013 nobody said life was supposed to be easy. But is it supposed to be hard?\nNo, I tell myself. I\u2019m just in a funk. I\u2019m at a crossroads with my finished-but-still-unpublished book, unfulfilled\u00a0with\u00a0my day job, feeling like I\u2019m between treading water and sometimes barely keeping my head above it. So when Nigel, who turns 15 next week, told me last night that his case manager at school said to ask me if he\u2019s going to be getting his driver\u2019s permit (what?!), I felt like I\u2019d been hit by a wall of water.\nI didn\u2019t know this was coming, although really, I did. I just didn\u2019t know it would be this week. But what shocks me more is that I was just talking about this with my good friend Carrie less than a week ago. (Got Carrie? If not, head on over there immediately. You\u2019ll be glad you did.) I was telling her how I didn\u2019t know how to tell my son that he\u2019s not ready to drive yet, in spite of how much he wants to. I told her how I\u2019ve been putting it off, not sure how to approach it, foolishly thinking I still had some time. And then, something amazing happened, as it usually does when we\u2019re with someone who listens and understands. Out of my mouth tumbled, \u201cMaybe he just needs to hear it from me\u201d or something along those lines. And I knew that I had to have the talk with him soon. I just didn\u2019t get it together quick enough. So, I copped out. Last night, as I had three different dinners cooking at once while he stood there expectantly, I\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cMaybe in a few months.\u201d I just couldn\u2019t\u00a0do it right then.\nBecause last night my other son needed me more. Last night Aidan was still recuperating from a vaccine reaction. Yes, I said it. I\u2019m going there. He had his 13-year physical two days ago (a couple months late, but oh well), and the nurse spouted off at least four different vaccinations or boosters that he \u201cneeded.\u201d We decided to go with one \u2013 the meningitis. It was the one that I felt strongest about, so we took it. Then I dropped him back off at school and I went back to work. In less than an hour, Aidan told me later, his arm was numb, and he had a headache and abdominal pains. My poor sweet boy didn\u2019t want to disturb me at work, so he suffered through it at school and told me when he got home. He slept badly that night, still experiencing the same problems. He stayed home from school the next day, and by that evening (last night), he was feeling better (although his arm still felt strange).\nI went in Aidan\u2019s room to talk to him before he went to sleep, as I do every night. I\u2019d had an epiphany, and I wanted to share it with him. My younger son has sensory processing disorder \u2013 gustatory, olfactory, tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular (worse than Nigel in all of these areas). And when Aidan was a baby, he cried almost constantly \u2013 but it didn\u2019t start until he was two months old. That was when he received his first round of what turned out to be no less than 16 vaccinations by the age of 18 months. (By comparison, I\u2019d received 6 vaccinations by the time I was 18 months. I guess I should consider myself lucky to be alive, as undervaccinated as I was.) \u00a0Aidan knows that he was a crier. He\u2019s heard the war stories. But, as I told him last night, now we know why. I think that it took months for his little body to assimilate the vaccines, and by the time he got through one round, it was time for another, and then another. His body was flooded, overwhelmed. And I believe that experience contributed to his sensory processing disorder.\nMaybe I\u2019m reaching. Maybe it\u2019s my funk. I don\u2019t think vaccines are bad. But once I made that connection with Aidan\u2019s babyhood, I felt like I\u2019d solved a 13-year mystery. And Aidan agreed with me; both of us achieved some closure. As I left his room, I blew him kisses from the doorway, as I do every night. Often he blows them back to me. Last night, I shut the door and stood in the hallway a moment. I heard him continue to blow kisses to me even after the door was shut.\nI can only hope that when I approach Nigel about the driving issue that I can word it in such a way that he can understand. \u00a0I don\u2019t want him to see it as a punishment, as a wall of water crashing down on him. I hope that what I\u00a0discussed with Carrie turns out to be right \u2013 that he just needs me to tell him. Maybe once I talk with him and get it all out on the table, I\u2019ll feel better. Free, even.

{"date": "October 29, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\nUsually when parents think of \u201cthe talk,\u201d we think of how to approach that first time that we tell our kids about sex \u2013 and all the other ensuing (hopefully much later) talks on the subject. Or the talk about drugs and alcohol. The talk about the importance of not stealing even if something \u201conly\u201d costs 25 cents. So many talks we parents have with our kids.\nAdd to that all the other difficult talks we have to have with our special needs kids. The talk about what autism is, and that he has it, or telling his brother about it. The talk about how sometimes kids are\u00a0not really\u00a0your friends if they try to get you to do something. Or if they say that you\u2019re \u201centertaining.\u201d\u00a0 And then, when the child with whom I\u2019d wondered if I\u2019d ever have a conversation more involved than \u201cWould you like a sandwich or eggs for dinner?\u201d progresses to the point that he tells me when he\u2019s turning 15 that he would like to get his driver\u2019s permit, I realize that I have to have yet another difficult \u201ctalk.\u201d Because as far as he\u2019s come, as glad as I am that when he was six or seven he could actually respond that he wanted eggs for dinner, he\u2019s not ready to drive. No way. And it\u2019s not because I\u2019m not ready to let him drive. It\u2019s because he\u2019s still far too distractible, impatient about traffic (in a scary way), and lacking judgment. Sure, many teens are that way. But with him it\u2019s exponential. And letting him drive now would not be good judgment on my part. In fact, it would be insanely irresponsible.\nBut he really wants to drive and actually started talking about it when he was twelve. So this talk has been looming in the back of my mind for three years. And I\u2019ve got to let him down gently. I\u2019ve got to figure out a way to tell him that there\u2019s yet another thing that his autism is going to affect, right when he\u2019s gotten to a point where he\u2019s started to accept it.\nSo I decide to do it during a time when he\u2019s relaxed but somewhat engaged in an activity that he enjoys. And when it\u2019s just the two of us carving pumpkins on a Saturday afternoon (since Aidan can\u2019t handle the smell and doesn\u2019t participate), I take a deep breath and dive in. I dance around the subject by casually mentioning some of the positive ways in which autism affects him \u00a0(learning to read early, being good with maps and remembering facts), and then I mention some of the difficult aspects (delay with learning to talk, his sensitive hearing, regulating behavior, etc.).\u00a0I forge ahead and say that some people with autism need to wait a few years before they\u2019re ready to start driving (as well as some who don\u2019t have autism).\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think I need to wait,\u201d he says, his voice calm but purposeful as he carefully saws off the top of his pumpkin. \u201cI think I\u2019m ready for my permit.\u201d\nI gently remind him of how impatient he gets with traffic and that his response indicates that he needs to work on that before he can start learning to drive. I tell him that being good with machines and having the\u00a0ability to operate the vehicle (his argument of readiness) is not the most important element of driving. That he needs responsibility, awareness, and judgment to safely drive a car.\nHe is still eerily calm. Is he actually understanding? I wonder, I hope. He quietly scoops out pumpkin seeds, seeming to take all of this in, although\u00a0I can feel his disappointment. Then he stops briefly and asks, \u201cWhen?\u201d\nGulp. I should have expected that question to be part of the equation. No stranger to being put on the spot, I remember Mama Edge\u2019s comment and quickly come up with a plan. I\u00a0tell him\u00a0that he needs to demonstrate three things to me whenever we\u2019re in the car \u2013 patience with traffic, focus on (my) driving and not being distracted, and awareness of other vehicles, drivers, and pedestrians.\u00a0I tell him that if he does all of those things in the next year, then when he\u2019s sixteen we\u2019ll discuss enrolling him in a driving class. I\u2019m not convinced that he\u2019ll be ready in a year. But I can\u2019t dash his hopes.\n\u201cDoes that sound good to you?\u201d I ask. \u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d he says in his usual flat voice. He won\u2019t make eye contact, but he is calm, accepting. I praise him for his maturity, tell him that this is the first step in demonstrating patience and responsibility. For years now, he\u2019s been aware of the limitations\u00a0due to his\u00a0autism, but he\u2019s learned to accept it and work with it. He may not be ready to drive in a year, but someday, he will. Autism\u00a0will\u00a0often delay him, as it did with talking and so many other things, but it won\u2019t stop him. This I know.\n* Nigel\u2019s is the happy one on the left\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/10/29/the-talk/", "title": "The Talk"},
{"date": "August 16, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tI\u2019ve never gone swimming with dolphins. But bathing with elephants has got to be at least as amazing.\nWe are in Chitwan National Park in southern Nepal for two days \u2013\u00a0a little side trip before working with Autism Care Nepal \u2013\u00a0as a way to become familiar with the people and culture. Chitwan means \u201cheart of the jungle,\u201d and with the humidity at 87%, temps in the 90s, that\u2019s just what this is.\n\nterraced rice farming south of Kathmandu\nWe arrived yesterday after a five-hour drive from Kathmandu down, down, down through winding mountain passes to this sub-tropical zone. I saw buses with passengers crouching on top and hanging off the sides. I saw roadside homes with corrugated metal roofs weighted down with stones. I saw poverty, but I did not see starvation. I saw terraced rice farming, cows, goats, and water buffalo, from which families obtain milk. I saw chickens and ducks, even a few pigs. Most of the Nepalese people get their needs met, just in a simpler way.\n\nOur hotel in Chitwan is lushly landscaped with jungly trees, flowers, and plants, including cannabis. Apparently, smoking pot is only legal one day a year in Nepal, like a holiday or something. The rest of the year it\u2019s illegal with harsh penalties, but that doesn\u2019t seem to deter them from using it as a landscaping element.\n\nthe cannabis plant on our balcony\n\nMy room is magical. The floor has one-foot square tiles with brown and tan mandalas printed on them. The walls are brick painted a light salmon color. There are yellow-gold curtains, a ceiling fan, and even a mosquito-net canopy over the bed. I have my own white-tiled bathroom and a shared balcony overlooking the beautiful gardens. All that plus three meals a day, guided tours, and an elephant safari for $91 US dollars total. If it weren\u2019t for the sweltering humidity, I\u2019d swear this was paradise.\n\nWe wake with the sun and have breakfast of scrambled eggs, toast, and orange juice, then we ride in a Jeep to the nearby river where we will embark on our morning canoe trip. There are five of us, plus our guide in front and the navigator in the rear, all in the same dugout canoe (pictured above). With all of us inside, the sides of the canoe rise merely\u00a0five inches above the water, and it bobs in a way that makes a couple of us uncomfortable, fearing our cameras getting submerged. And then concern for the cameras moves to the backs of our minds as the guide points out a crocodile. Yes, a full-grown crocodile, a mere fifteen feet away. We snap photos and continue on. We see many exotic birds, including kingfishers and peacocks. We see two more crocodiles, including one with just its eyes poking out of the water. Jungle, indeed.\n\nthe first croc \u2013 this close without zooming in!\nFinally the navigator expertly steers us to shore and we shakily climb out and begin our walk through the jungle to the elephant breeding station. On the way we see foot-long orange millipedes, a six-foot high termite hill, and more birds. We hear their calls and the insects\u2019 buzzing and all the other jungle sounds. It\u2019s like Disneyland\u2019s Jungle Cruise ride, except real. We get to interact with baby elephants \u2013 two eight-month-old twins, the only Indian elephant twins born in captivity, and a boisterous yearling. Their trunks are soft and inquisitive, and their eyes are soulful yet playful.\n\nWe go to the interpretive center at Chitwan National Park, where wild geckos skitter across the walls. Our guide points out one display in particular which describes the symbiosis between the monkeys and deer of the park. They have an interdependent relationship in which the monkeys, who sit high in the jungle treetops, toss down nuts and fruit for the deer to eat and warn them of approaching predators. The deer, in turn, carry the monkeys on their backs when they want to cross the river. In a similar light, elephants and people share a level of symbiosis. In southern Nepal, people train elephants as beasts of burden, and in turn, the people care for the elephants and bathe them in a way that the elephants cannot do for themselves. And so, my fellow travelers and I had the powerful emotional experience of bathing an elephant. Not by standing and using buckets and scrub brushes on poles as in the old circus cartoons, but by going into the river and bathing the elephants by hand. It was nothing short of amazing.\n\nFirst, the elephants douse themselves using their trunk. The person(s) bathing them climb onto the elephants\u2019 bare backs, and then the elephants fill their trunks with water and spray themselves and their bathers (I\u2019m the one in front, pictured above). This goes on for a full five minutes. Then the bathers dismount the elephant and she (ours is female) lies down on the river banks so that one side of her body is exposed while still in the water. The human bathers then pick up a palm-sized stone and scrub the elephant\u2019s thick skin, all the while rinsing\u00a0her with handfuls of water. Then, the elephant slowly and carefully turns over to have her other side scrubbed and rinsed.\n\nI will always remember what it is like to look deep into the eye of an elephant looking at me appreciatively as I gently wash her face. I am fully clothed, in river water up to my thighs, my bare feet are sunk in silty mud, and all I can think about is her gorgeous hazel eye looking up at me from beneath inch-long eyelashes. Four other people are bathing this beautiful creature, rinsing and scrubbing as a team. Tomorrow, she will give some of us a ride through the jungle.\n\nwild rhino viewed\u00a0during\u00a0our elephant safari\nIn many ways I see this trip to Nepal as a symbiotic journey. We from the US are going to impart autism awareness and strategies for the Nepalese parents to help their children with autism through the use of PECS, ABA basics, and sensory integration. But we are not the only ones with knowledge. The Nepalese people have much to teach us about the importance of caring for others \u2013 including elephants \u2013 and the value of living simply. Our guide at Chitwan National Park told us that Nepal as an acronym means \u201cnever-ending peace and love.\u201d We could stand to learn about that, too.\n\nsunset along the river in Chitwan\n*For more photos and Nikki\u2019s description of our time in Chitwan, click here.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.travelblog.org/Asia/blog-419370.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/08/16/symbiosis/", "title": "Symbiosis"},

It is early evening; the desert sun is low. The mother settles into a chaise lounge near the pool, and her sons drop off their towels on chairs near her. They walk around to the deep end of the pool as the mother opens up a book.

He is satisfied with\u00a0her acknowledgement and\u00a0glides over to the far corner of the pool. The younger brother then readies himself: he backs up, strides toward the edge, and jumps. He does not exhibit the cannonball form of his brother, but his long hair flies impressively. The mother wishes she had filmed it. He surfaces, spluttering.\nYounger brother, sneering: You LIE!!\nHe lunges through the water toward his older brother, who laughs as he evades him. The mother hides her smile behind her book.

{"date": "August 9, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tI love to travel, and I\u2019ve been to several different countries and parts of this one. And though I always enjoy exploring the new places once I arrive, I enjoy the process of getting there as well. You know, \u2018getting there is half the fun\u2019 and all that. Well, I don\u2019t know about half, but I always\u00a0enjoy something along the way. \u00a0And with approximately 27 hours of travel time from LAX to Kathmandu, I knew I\u2019d have fun people-watching and eavesdropping.\nTake, for example, the very young family I heard behind me on the shuttle bus to LAX. I couldn\u2019t see them, but from hearing them talk about which friends hooked up at which bars and then bicker about holding their baby the right way, I deduced that they were fairly young. At one point, the girl, whose voice was much louder, declared, \u201cI\u2019m so mad at you! You didn\u2019t tell me that!\u201d The guy answered, \u201cI just now remembered.\u201d And she responded, \u201cYou have to take care of the baby the rest of the night!\u201d But my favorite, a moment later, was her response to his foolish statement, \u201cI don\u2019t get why you\u2019re mad.\u201d She said, \u201cWhat don\u2019t you understand? I\u2019m wearing braces and I\u2019m pregnant!\u201d Classic. I doubt I\u2019d hear that in most other countries.\nOn the flight to Bangkok, there is no one next to me, so not only can I avoid annoying flight chit-chat, I can also turn to my side and put my feet up while I sleep. I read, I watch movies, I am served three full meals, including wine that\u2019s semi-decent. It\u2019s probably the most enjoyable international flight I\u2019ve ever had. Then I have four hours in Bangkok before the flight to Kathmandu. I walk around for about an hour, then sit and read, then walk some more. My ankles and feet are swollen with edema, and I massage my calves to help my circulation. I am allowed to go through security about an hour before boarding time, and I go to the gate and sit down amid a group of fellow travelers.\nIt is so humbling, to me, to hear people from different countries conversing in English. It surprises me at the Bangkok airport to hear a Philippine woman telling a Nepalese man about the internship she is completing for her Master\u2019s program. They both speak in flawless English. Humbling. All I know in Nepali is \u201cNamaste.\u201d\nSo far there are five Caucasians waiting for this flight. A young couple, a lone man, and two lone women \u2013 including myself. There are a few Japanese and one Korean (who is also speaking English). Many travelers wear surgical masks for airborne disease protection. For this trip, I have been vaccinated against typhoid fever, tetanus, diphtheria, and hepatitis. I brought Deet spray, probiotic pills, and most of my medicine cabinet. I hope I stay healthy.\nAnother Caucasian man saunters down the steps to the gate. The Philippine woman is asking the Nepalese man how to say \u201cnice to meet you\u201d in Nepali. The Nepalese man tells her a very long phrase and she repeats it. He smiles and says that she can just say \u201cNamaste.\u201d Then she practices \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d in Nepali, and I feel that I should have learned a little Nepali before this trip. I really wish I knew how to say \u201cexcuse me\u201d for when I bump someone or commit some social faux pas, which is highly likely. I could ask the lovely Nepalese man who is talking with the Philippine woman, but I\u2019m too introverted to join in. Not for the first time, feeling at a great disadvantage, I question the wisdom of taking this trip. Then another Caucasian man strolls to the gate, perhaps a clueless American like me. I try again to listen in to the conversation between the Philippine woman and Nepalese man and try to absorb something. It\u2019s the least I can do. The Korean woman joins them and I feel simply ridiculous that I cannot bring myself to do so.\nMoments later, I find myself behind the Nepalese man as we are in line waiting to board. His wife, an absolutely beautiful woman, turns and smiles at me, and I smile back. Her husband picks up a Wall Street Journal \u2013 in English \u2013 as we board the plane. Again I feel like the ignorant American. The plane is even bigger than the one I took on the 16-hour flight here (16 hours!) and appears to be fuller. I cannot put my feet up on this flight, and my ankles have swollen to twice their size with edema. It feels like the skin on them will split. I have endured this sensation now for at least eight hours. Fortunately this flight is only about three hours. But I\u2019m disappointed to find that, although I have a window seat, it is not only directly over the huge wing, but it is on the left side of the plane. According to my online research, if you\u2019re on the right side of the plane when approaching Nepal from the east, you can see the Himalayas.\nWe take off, and I catch my first glimpse of Thailand, having been in the airport for four hours. It is lushly green due to the monsoon season, which Nepal is also having. Not many tourists this time of year; I fear I will stand out too much, me and my blond, American \u201cNamaste.\u201d\nAfter viewing a movie, a map popped up on the screen to show the flight\u2019s progress. We are half-way to Kathmandu, looks like. And my swollen ankles and feet are sca-reaming. This has happened before on a trip \u2013 two years ago when I went to Greece and it was 122 degrees on Crete as we made our way to the airport to fly back to Athens. But now, I can\u2019t put my feet up on this flight, and it scares me to even look at my ankles.\nClouds all across Myanmar and Bangladesh. We are above them. Ah! An announcement. We are beginning our descent and will land in twenty minutes! Relief for my ankles sooner than I\u2019d thought. And the flight attendants come by with gorgeous purple and white orchid boutonnieres for each passenger. I put mine on and happen to glance out the windows on the opposite side of the plane. I see small, white pointy peaks, and for a second I think they are just the clouds. Another passenger\u2019s head blocks my already limited view from all the way across the plane. And he is looking because \u2013 yes \u2013 it\u2019s the Himalayas. The man next to him takes a photo. I strain to see again, and I catch a tease of a glimpse. But then the plane turns and, ohGodinheaven, I see them. I see the beautiful snow-covered peaks poking up through the clouds. I see them out my own window. They are truly magnificent. We turn again and descend lower and I can no longer see them. But I did. I saw the tips of the incredible Himalayas with my own eyes.\nI am breathless now, not even thinking about my ankles, or the fact that I only know one word in Nepali. Namaste. Yes, I am here. And Namaste again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/08/09/getting-there/", "title": "Getting There"},
{"date": "August 11, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tI have made it 24 hours remembering not to consume a drop of tap water. In Nepal, the tap water is not processed as ours is. Nepalese people have developed anti-bodies, so they are fine with it. But we cannot even brush our teeth with it. I like to wet my toothbrush before putting the toothpaste on it, and here I must do that, as well as rinsing afterward, using bottled water. I\u2019m so afraid I\u2019ll forget out of habit. I also have to be very careful not to allow water to get in my mouth when washing my face and showering.\nWe are staying in a charming hotel called the International Guest House and have air conditioning in our room as long as the power stays on. (In Nepal, power is often arbitrarily shut off for several hours at a time, any time of day. Some businesses \u2013 and especially hospitals \u2013 have generators.) Our room is lovely. Nepal\u2019s main religion is a blend of Hinduism and Buddhism, so our room has a beautiful print of Hindu gods and goddesses on one wall and across from it is a gorgeous print of Buddha. Our room key is an old fashioned skeleton key, which I love. We have brown-gold shantung curtains on the windows and wooden screens with honeycomb cut-outs as room partitions. We have a private balcony overlooking a slate courtyard bordered by lush bushes and small potted trees and flowers. It is enchanting.\n\nIn the courtyard entrance of our hotel\nIn Kathmandu, at least in the touristy part called Thamel, many people speak a few words of English, some speak many, and I am again humbled. Everyone is friendly, and the children look so cute on their way to school, with their uniforms of a white button-up shirt, ties (both boys and girls), and pants or skirts that match their ties. Some of the little ones break into huge grins when they see us and say \u201cHello! Hello!\u201d and we do the same.\n\nWe are on our way to the Monkey Temple, and after a while, Nikki (the director of Knowledge for People) and I aren\u2019t sure if we\u2019re going the right way. We can see it up on a hill top (in the above photo, top-center-right), but we\u2019re not sure how to get to it. Nikki asks for directions. Some people, especially women, politely decline, but the men are more than happy to assist. We walk through residential areas, noting laundry being hung out to dry, many stray dogs roaming around, lots of brick apartment buildings, motorcycles, a few cows and a pig with piglets, and\u00a0piles of trash everywhere. Kathmandu does not appear to have a waste management system. Then I remember that we are in the most industrialized part of a developing country. Most streets are narrow, some only partially paved, and everyone drives as fast as they can, honking horns wildly, especially around corners. When there is a near collision, there is no road rage. Both cars slam on their brakes, the drivers look at each other, both back up a bit, and then whoever has the right of way goes first. I have no idea who has the right of way. I just know that pedestrians don\u2019t. We learn to stay out of the way, which is difficult without sidewalks. Crossing the street is a nightmare. I don\u2019t know how people do it.\n\nat the base of the Monkey Temple\nThe Monkey Temple, which we finally reach, is aptly named. They look like miniature brown baboons \u2013 crossing the walkways, climbing the trees, eating grass, grooming each other. I have to restrain myself from taking too many photos. This is amazing! They are so close! There are babies!\n\n\n\nBeing monsoon season, the humidity is super high, and my face feels as if it is melting off. Sweat pours down my back, chest, and legs. We drink (bottled) water as fast as we can sweat it out. After lying down and sleeping twelve hours straight last night, my ankles and feet are not as swollen, but they are not yet back to normal. I look ahead at the steep stairway up to the actual temple at the top of the hill and pace myself as we begin the climb. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe are accosted by a mother and children begging. They will not leave us alone, especially one girl around age ten who follows us half-way up the stairs, saying, \u201cM-m-m-m-hospital-m-m-m-broken arm-m-m-m.\u201d I glance at her arm, elevated by a thin scarf tied around her neck. I can see all of her arm and it is clearly fine. We have been told not to continue the cycle by giving in. I gently say no about six times, even as her eyes penetrate me.\n\nWe reach the top of the beautiful, albeit touristy temple and proceed in a clockwise motion around it. We take in the view of the city, buy some prayer flags, and slowly head back down the steep stairway. Not wanting to get lost on the way back to the hotel, we take a cab, with Nikki deftly bargaining the driver to less than half\u00a0the fare\u00a0he originally proposed. (According to her guide book, he was really trying to rip us off.) He\u00a0darts through traffic, weaving all over the place, probably mad that he couldn\u2019t fool us, but he gets us back to the hotel okay. We go in to cool off and rest, exhausted from the morning\u2019s excursion. Then we will head out in search of lunch and more bottled water!\nFor more photos and Nikki\u2019s description of\u00a0our day, click here.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://knowledgeforpeople.org/", "http://www.travelblog.org/Asia/Nepal/Kathmandu/blog-418743.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/08/11/kathmandu-in-the-morning/", "title": "Kathmandu in the Morning"},
{"date": "August 14, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tWe interrupt the Nepal travelogue to bring you this shocking news: I am now the mother of two teens! How is that possible?\n\nphoto taken March \u201908, at Great-Grandma\u2019s 90th Birthday Party\nDear Aidan,\nSome parents will tell their teenagers that \u201cit seems like only yesterday\u201d that they were born, that they were learning to sit up or walk. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s true for them \u2013 I\u2019m not knocking it. But you and I both know that it\u2019s been a long road in this family. And while I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re 13 (!), it doesn\u2019t feel like yesterday that you were little.\nOf course I remember holding you, rocking you, singing to you. But I also remember that soon after you were born, Nigel began exhibiting signs of autism, which we didn\u2019t know at the time. And then both of you exhibited extreme sensory distress and significant language delays. For a while, I thought I had two boys with autism. And while you were never officially diagnosed, you also had special needs that had to be addressed.\nBut whether you had special needs or not, you have always been special to me, and important. I just want to make sure you know that. Because in spite of having your own needs, you have often had to take a back seat to someone whose needs overrode yours. And you have always done so with love and acceptance. I know you often felt like you were the older brother, having to look out for Nigel. When you were younger, you wondered why your brother acted the way he did. I know you still do. And I know it\u2019s been hard for you, especially at school, to carve out your own identity separate from your brother\u2019s and to deal with the comments of small-minded peers.\nI so admire you for your perseverance, and your courage. You faced a scary health problem earlier this year, and I know how that worried you. I was worried too. I\u2019m so relieved that the surgery was successful and that you\u2019ve recovered. Your best friend moved away a few months ago, and that\u2019s been hard for you too. But you started hanging out with other kids and made the best of it, and I\u2019m so proud of you. You\u2019ve even started eating new foods. You are resilient, responsible, and resourceful.\nI love your amazing, intelligent, creative mind. I\u2019m in awe of the questions you pose and the deep, philosophical discussions we\u2019ve had. I enjoy curling up on the couch with you and watching movies. I\u2019ve missed that so much this summer! And I\u2019ve missed you. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be with you on your birthday, but you\u2019ll be home soon, and we\u2019ll make up for it. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re having this time with your dad, because that\u2019s important too. I know you miss him a lot during the school year, and you do the best you can with that. Like I said, it\u2019s been a long road in this family.\nHappy Birthday, Aidan. I\u2019m so happy that you\u2019re my son, for so many reasons. I hope that your first year of your teens is way cool!\nAll my love,\nMom\nP.S. Being a teen has its privileges. You\u2019ll be happy to know that I\u2019m finally getting you a cell phone.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/08/14/a-letter-to-my-son-on-his-13th-birthday/", "title": "A Letter to My Son on His 13th Birthday"},
{"date": "August 18, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tNow we get to the heart of the matter \u2013 the reason the Knowledge for People team came to Nepal. We have taken some time to get over our jetlag, do some sightseeing, and acclimate a little. Now it\u2019s time to work. And I have come to realize that, apart from raising my children, it is the most fulfilling work of my life.\nAutismCare Nepal is a small, new, parent-founded center in Kathmandu. It is also entirely parent-funded. Most of the parents had to go to Delhi, India, to receive a diagnosis for their children and therapy/treatment suggestions. Imagine having to go to a different country for a diagnosis. They had absolutely no resources for autism families in Nepal. AutismCare Nepal is the first step to rectifying that.\n\nZahida, Tanya, Ann-Marie, Nikki, Dori\nAnd that sort of makes the Knowledge for People team the second step. Our team is comprised of Nikki (the director), Dori (speech therapist), Ann-Marie (ABA teacher), Zahida (behaviorist), Blaine (photo/videographer), and me (parent representative). We have prepared presentations on general autism information, parenting experience, ABA therapy, PECS, social stories, and sensory integration therapy. Our idea was to have two days at the beginning of the week to give the presentations, as a way to introduce the background knowledge about the therapies and strategies. Then we would spend the rest of the week working directly with the children (twelve of them, we were told) and their parents on an individual basis. Upon our arrival, we discover that things have been rearranged. The presentations are now scheduled for the end of the week, and individual sessions will be done first. Not only that, but due to a news article about our arrival that had been published the week prior, the number of children jumped from twelve to thirty. We never thought there would be so many. But then again, this is autism. The rapid increase in Kathmandu mirrors the increase in developed countries. I immediately saw the parallel.\nSo, we figured out a way to fit in 28 individual sessions with the families. We wish we could work with them all individually, but this was the best we could do. The two families we couldn\u2019t fit in (and there were even more as the week went on!) agreed to attend the presentations at the end of the week and ask questions about their individual needs then. We set up stations in different rooms of the center, which is a two-story house that the parents rent (in addition to their regular living expenses). One room is for PECS and social story instruction, another room is for ABA/DIR Floortime instruction, and the third is for sensory integration. The parents and children rotate through each of the rooms, spending close to an hour in each one. Some of them have walked a great distance to be here. Some of them have taken various buses for over an hour. Some speak a little English, some none at all. By the time all of those scheduled for that day have gone through all of the rooms, the poor kids are past their limits. It is exhausting for everyone.\u00a0 As an introvert, it is difficult for me to give a condensed version of my half-hour-long sensory integration presentation to each new parent. I have to do this otherwise they will not understand the reasoning for the sensory therapy techniques that Zahida (who is studying to be an OT) and I are suggesting for their children. I have to describe, among many other things, the vestibular and proprioceptive senses 28 separate times (29 if you count the presentation at the end of the week). I wish we could have done the presentations at the beginning of the week, so that everyone would have this information prior to the individual sessions, but I have to be flexible and focus on doing it differently than I expected. And here I see another parallel \u2013 learning to be flexible when plans change is something that my own son struggles with on a regular basis. Now I have some idea of just how exhausting it is for him.\nAside from adjusting to the change in plans and the increase in children, overall our individual sessions go very well. The children range in age from three to eleven, at different areas of the spectrum. Several of them are nonverbal, and some have limited verbal ability. Some are fearful, some are not. Some are quiet and complacent, others are loud and aggressive. Some throw sensory seeds all over the room, a few lie down and nap. Some put everything in their mouths, some categorize and line things up. But all of them, well, they are simply beautiful. I see so much of my son in many of them that it throws me back to the early days of his autism diagnosis, when we didn\u2019t have the internet for information and support, and all the books I could find were archaic or otherwise not helpful. This is where those parents are. And they are wonderful \u2013 so dedicated to their children and eager to learn. My experience of having my son\u2019s diagnosis twelve years ago helps me to have some idea of what they\u2019re going through now. I look into these parents\u2019 tired but yearning eyes and want to throw my arms around them.\nAnd of course they have questions. Tons of questions. Questions about spitting, toilet training, masturbation, safety, eye contact, head-banging, you name it. They are sponges, for lack of a better metaphor, absorbing every suggestion, every piece of information I can give. But no one has all the answers, especially not me. And near the end of one of my individual sessions, when a five-year-old girl begins having a seizure, I freeze. Her mother is sitting cross-legged on the floor with her daughter lying in her lap. She does not speak English and the translator was needed elsewhere, so I have no way to communicate. But the mother, of course, knows what to do. She calmly holds her daughter as she seizes; I watch her little body twitch violently, and she moans with each spasm. I wonder if\u00a0she is in pain, or afraid, but maybe\u00a0her\u00a0sounds are\u00a0involuntary. I don\u2019t know. I feel useless. I have no experience with seizures, and this one seems to be lasting a minute, but feels longer. Trying not to panic, I ask if she needs anything. The mother glances at me. I know she does not understand my words, but I think she senses the concern in my voice, and there is some sort of appreciation in her eyes.\u00a0 Then she turns her attention back to her daughter, who soon stops convulsing. A moment later, the mother picks up her things and, with her daughter in her arms, says Namaste and leaves.\nI take a break. I blot my face, drink some water, and go in the next room to observe the end of a PECS session. I know if I go somewhere alone, my emotions will overcome me, and now is not a good time for that. It is mentally and emotionally taxing, this work we are doing, but as I mentioned above, it is the most fulfilling of my life. I know that my suggestions cannot help everyone, like the parents whose children have seizures, but I also know that my presence here is making a difference. They know that people out there care. That we would come from half way across the world to try to help, to tell them they are not alone. Yes, that is the reason.\nFor photos of us \u201cin action\u201d working with the kids and parents, click here.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://knowledgeforpeople.org/", "http://www.autismnepal.org/", "http://www.travelblog.org/Asia/Nepal/Kathmandu/blog-420494.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/08/18/the-reason/", "title": "The Reason"},
{"date": "August 20, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tAs some reading this post already know, I recently returned from a trip to Nepal. I was part of a team of therapists and teachers from Knowledge for People, a non-profit organization that helps with autism education and outreach in developing countries. We spent two weeks in this beautiful, diverse country, working with wonderful people. It was simply an incredible experience overall, but nothing could have prepared me for the emotional impact it had on me at the end.\nWe spent the first few days getting over our jetlag, doing a bit of sightseeing, and acclimating to the culture. Then we worked directly with 28 families in individual sessions (which I described in this previous post). With the help of translators, we taught them the basics of PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System), ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) therapy, and sensory integration. The parents were so appreciative, and we could see the children benefitting from just the couple of hours they spent with us. Many were nonverbal, and some of them took to PECS right away, which was so exciting to see and experience. \nThe parents we met and worked with are truly dedicated to their children and doing all they can to help them. Both mothers and fathers are heavily involved, and in many cases, so is the extended family. We worked with grandparents, aunts and uncles, and older siblings. It was so positive to see such dedication in a country that has little information about autism available. They try so hard, and I could see the worry and exhaustion on their faces. But I could also see the love. It was there every minute.\nAt the end of the week of individual sessions came the two-day presentation workshop. Sixty to seventy people filled the festive, tented area that was set up in the courtyard of the small center called AutismCare Nepal. Chairs were rented, banners were posted, lunch was catered. It was definitely a big event. Many of the parents and extended families we\u2019d worked with attended, but so did teachers, reporters, pediatricians, and other doctors. We were thrilled with the turnout, even given the fact that Kathmandu\u2019s public transportation system was on strike that weekend. \nWe prepared presentations on the following topics: general autism information, parenting experience, ABA therapy, PECS, social stories, and sensory integration therapy. Before the presentations began, we met with our translators to go over the material and see if they had any questions. I sat down with my translator, a doctor whom I\u2019d already met a few days before when we had the individual session with her family \u2013 her husband, their three-year-old son, and his grandmother. She looked over the outline of my presentation about my experience with my now-14-year-old son, from the early days of being nonverbal and having agonizing sensory issues to slowly, painstakingly learning to talk and cope with sensory integration. I mentioned the difficulties we had later with mainstreaming, how he was so tortured by bullying. My voice broke as I talked with her, and we cried together as she told me that she has the same fears for her son. I was awed by the depth of feeling I could share with someone living on the other side of the world.\nMoments later, we composed ourselves and went out to the presentation area. Fortunately we were not the first to speak that day. But when the time did come, and we stood in front of all the parents, teachers, doctors, and other attendees, we weren\u2019t the only emotional ones. After I introduced myself and talked about my experience with my son, pausing often for translation, I said this to them:\n\u201cWe live far away; our lives, jobs, and cultures are very different. But we have one thing in common \u2013 our children. No matter where we live, we understand that part of each other\u2019s lives. In the United States we like to say, \u2018It takes a village to raise a child,\u2019 meaning that many people are involved in caring for a child and teaching him or her. When a child has autism, that statement is doubly true. It takes more than a village. That is why we are here, from another country, to talk about our experiences and strategies that have worked for our children. Having a child with autism is a tremendous challenge, the biggest of my life. You have other challenges in your life that I do not understand. But in this challenge \u2013 autism \u2013 we are connected. You are not alone.\u201d\nI talked to them for a while, feeling the bond grow deeper with each word that my equally emotional translator conveyed to them. At the end of the day, those who could speak some English came up to me to thank me personally. I was so moved by their gratitude, and their love.\nOn one of the nights during the week, we had dinner at the lovely home of the parent-founders of the center. In Kathmandu, it is common to see homes with rebar cable sticking up out of the top, as pictured below. Embedded in the foundation, the cables provide the structure for the pillars of each floor of the home. Often, the owners stop building at two floors, but the rebar cables still stick up from the roof, exposed, in case they are able to build another floor in the future. \u201cWe call them pillars of hope,\u201d Hem, the father, said with a smile. \nI\u2019d like to think of the work that we did in Nepal as a pillar of hope. \u201cYou are not only helping our families, you are helping our country,\u201d Hem also said. We weren\u2019t able to be there long enough to build a new floor, but the hope is definitely there.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://knowledgeforpeople.org/", "http://www.autismnepal.org/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/08/20/pillars-of-hope/", "title": "Pillars of Hope"},

I\u2019ve got one more\u00a0story to share.\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\nI am in one of the most incredible places on earth. The Knowledge for People team is taking a break from our intensive work with AutismCare Nepal in Kathmandu to take an overnight trip to Nagarkot, a mountain village two hours to the north. People flock here in trekking season to see the sunrise over the Himalayas, including Everest (which is called Sagarmatha in Nepal). Now it is monsoon season, so the big mountains are cloaked in clouds. We cannot see them at all, and we are told that we probably won\u2019t be able to while we\u2019re here. But from our hotel, we can still see the area below them, a lush green valley dotted by homes and etched with rice terraces.\nFollowing our late afternoon arrival, some of us meet in the lobby area for drinks. We sit on a balcony overlooking the valley, and we order cocktails and crunchy, savory pekoda, a fried Nepalese hors d\u2019oeuvre made with ground garbonzo beans and shredded vegetables. It\u2019s my favorite Nepalese food, and I eat it nearly every day of the trip. After a while, it begins to rain lightly and then something appears that I never would have dreamed I\u2019d see. It\u2019s the most picturesque rainbow of my life, right over the beautiful Himalayan valley below us. We gasp \u2013 the entire scene is stunning, and we cannot believe our good fortune. We may not be able to see the Himalayas, but we know they are there, and this gorgeous rainbow, shared with some wonderful new friends, is enough.\nThose who\u2019ve known me for a while know that I\u2019ve always loved mountains. At heart, I consider myself a \u201cbeach person,\u201d but I love traveling to view mountains and often climb them. Last summer, my sister and I climbed Mt. Shasta, a fourteener in California, and last September, Nigel and I climbed ten-and-a-half-thousand-foot Mt. Lassen. But my love for Nepal and the Himalayas goes back thirty years. Last year, I wrote about how as a child I would sit and read my parents\u2019 25-volume Encyclopaedia Britannica set, learning many things. The year that I was eight, I learned about autism and I learned about Nepal. From that young age I knew that I wanted to travel to Nepal someday, but never at any point could I have foreseen that these two things I had first learned about so long ago would manifest themselves together in this wondrous experience. Who would have thought? Yet here I am, thirty years later, traveling to Nepal to teach about autism.\nBack at the hotel, I have made it eight days remembering not to rinse my toothbrush in tap water. Tonight, thinking about the Himalayas, I finish brushing my teeth and immediately stick it under the faucet to rinse it. I realize right away what I have done and throw the toothbrush in the trash. I\u2019ll get a new one back in Kathmandu tomorrow afternoon. While I sleep, I dream of seeing the elusive Himalayas with the sunrise, although in my dream we had to hike a mile to get to a point where we could see them.\n\nI wake shortly after 5:30 and bolt out of bed. The clouds have dissipated slightly and I can see the lower parts of the mountains! Not much, but at least it\u2019s something, in addition to the glimpse from the plane. I wash up, dress, and visit with my friends. The cloud cover is blocking the solar eclipse that is going on (yes, I was in Nepal for the 2009 eclipse!), but we definitely notice the sky darken slightly as it happens. Afterward, I go downstairs to have my massage (my first one in years!), and then come back to the room to shower.\n\nI meet up with Dori, the speech therapist on the team, and we go have breakfast in the hotel restaurant. We sit outdoors because \u2013 wonder of wonders \u2013 the clouds have cleared! We can see the majestic Himalayas! We can stare at them while we eat breakfast! My thirty years of wanting to see the Himalayas with my own eyes has come to fruition. While waiting for my food, I walk over to a diagram placed on a wooden sign showing the names of each of the Himalayan peaks from that viewpoint. I find Everest on the diagram and squint to try to find it in the mountain range laid out before me. \u00a0I find where it is supposed to be, having determined the mountains on either side of it. And then I see what I believe to be its base, but I can\u2019t see the top. And that\u2019s okay. This dazzling display is more than I had hoped for during this off-season trip, and I am sated. Moments later, the clouds roll in again, and we can no longer see the mountains or even the valley.\nBesides, I have to save something for next time.\n\nthe base of Mt. Everest is right in the\u00a0middle of this photo\n*For more fantastic pics and Nikki\u2019s description of our time in Nagarkot, click here.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://knowledgeforpeople.org/", "http://www.autismnepal.org/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteener", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_July_22,_2009", "http://www.travelblog.org/Asia/Nepal/Nagarkot/blog-422197.html", "http://www.travelblog.org/Asia/Nepal/Nagarkot/blog-422197.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/08/23/the-roof-of-the-world/", "title": "The Roof of the World"},

{"date": "August 25, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tMy boys, my two big teenagers, are home! I drove the long drive to pick them up, hugged them, laughed when they called me \u201cDad-Mom\u201d for the millionth time, piled their suitcases, computer, pillows, books, movies, Xbox 360, and two bicycles and helmets into my small SUV, and drove back home. Whew. This was their eighth summer in LA.\nLast year when they returned, I wrote about my anxiety concerning the long-term effects that this going-back-and-forth arrangement might have on them. I can\u2019t help thinking about that. But then I realized that what we do is far better than the alternative \u2013 not spending time with their father. It\u2019s not an easy situation, and we do the best we can with it. But this year I didn\u2019t really dwell on that too much. This year, this pick-up, was all about reminiscing.\nI remembered the first time we did the 700-Mile Kid Swap, nearly eight years ago. Nigel was seven and Aidan was five. It was for less than a week that first time, for a winter visit. I remember how we transferred all of their stuff out of my car into their dad\u2019s car, hugged goodbye, and drove off in opposite directions. They got in the southbound lane to LA, and I got in the northbound lane to Oregon. I remember crying on the onramp as I realized that this would be the first of many times that I would drive home without my children. And they were so little.\nThat first summer, when Aidan turned six and Nigel was not yet eight, they were gone for six weeks, and I went to visit them at the three-week point. I think Nigel thought that I had come to take him back with me, and he cried when I said goodbye after the weekend visit, actually said \u201cAll done LA,\u201d at a time when his speech was so limited. Broke. My. Heart. And then when they did come back to Oregon, Aidan had such a hard time transitioning and readjusting that he lashed out at me and told me he didn\u2019t want to live with me anymore. I had thought we might go through that when he was a little older, but not at six. It took him a month to work through it. Broke. My. Heart.\nSo it\u2019s been hard \u2013 on all of us. And though we still miss each other when we\u2019re apart, we\u2019ve come a long way in dealing with our reality. We all have hard parts of our lives \u2013 autism, divorce, money or health issues \u2013 and we do the best we can with them. That\u2019s all we can do. We have to work with what is. And I think that, over the years, my boys and I have done pretty well with our \u201cwhat is.\u201d We might feel, as Aidan said at age seven, like we have two lives, but we\u2019ve learned how to blend them seamlessly. We\u2019ve adapted. And we\u2019ve thrived.\nIt may not be what I would have wished for or expected when I started my family, but that\u2019s okay. It may not be ideal, but we\u2019ve made it work for us, and I\u2019m rather proud of that. We\u2019re, like, pros in the long-distance family department. We have absolutely no transitioning problems now.

{"date": "December 13, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nSometimes, as a mom blogger, I get the feeling that my kids somehow tap into the wavelength of a post I\u2019ve written \u2013 before I even post it. And then they come to me and totally disprove whatever I\u2019ve written about them.\nFor instance, the night that I wrote \u201cPolite Conversation,\u201d about Nigel using lengthy delayed echolalia at the dinner table one evening, he came into my office \u2013 minutes before I posted it \u2013 and began what was undoubtedly the most incredible conversation I\u2019ve ever had with him. \u00a0I honestly didn\u2019t realize that he was capable of a serious back-and-forth discussion regarding intangible ideas for over half an hour. And he revealed so much more about himself during the course of it.\nHe started off by running into my office, eyes wide. \u201cMom! Have you heard of something called \u2018home births\u2019? Because I think I want to have my children that way and I wanted to see what you thought of it.\u201d\nDefinitely didn\u2019t see that coming. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard of them. But I think that you should talk to your wife about it first. And I don\u2019t think you need to worry about that for a long time.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean when I\u2019m 18?\u201d\n(!) \u201cNo, I think that\u2019s a bit early. You need to have a good job and a home for your family before you start thinking about having children.\u201d\n\u201c20?\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a bit early also.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I need to be prepared.\u201d That\u2019s six years of Scouting talking.\nThen he sat down on a chair that\u2019s across from my desk, and the topic changed to dating. He mentioned, quite wisely, that he needed to have a girlfriend before he could have a wife, and that there didn\u2019t seem to be any girls at the high school who really understood him. He said that some of them were nice to him, but he was worried that they might not be sincere. \u201cWhat if they ask me out on a date, but they\u2019re just trying to trick me? How will I know the difference?\u201d\nMy heart ached to hear him say it. He already knows that he is vulnerable to this. I told him that one thing that will help is to be friends with a girl before dating. And then, I pulled out my new copy of The Unwritten Rules of Social Relationships: Decoding Social Mysteries Through the Unique Perspectives of Autism by Temple Grandin and Sean Barron. It had just arrived from Amazon mere days before, and I had been waiting for the perfect opportunity to tell Nigel about it. I couldn\u2019t have planned this better if I tried.\nHe seemed interested. I asked him if he wanted to read it himself or if he wanted us to read it together, and he opted to read it on his own. I was thrilled by his positive response! Somehow I had tapped into what he needed \u2013 before he even asked. But of course, we autism parents do that all the time, especially when our kids can\u2019t ask. \u00a0\nWe talked some more. We conversed. He made eye contact, he posed ideas and waited for my response, and then he responded to my ideas. Sometimes he added even more to his response. His voice inflection was perfectly appropriate, he tried new words and asked me if he used them correctly, he was fully engaged. My heart was bursting with joy, because for many years I didn\u2019t know if such conversations could ever take place.\nThen at one point he leaned forward in his chair and said, \u201cI think I\u2019m different from other autistics because I want to be a normal man and have a wife and family.\u201d\nI tried not to let my face show too much emotion, but lately my son has been causing me to tear up a lot. \u201cOh, honey. Yes, your autism makes you different and makes some things more difficult to achieve, but don\u2019t ever think that you can\u2019t be a normal man if you don\u2019t have a wife and family. Whatever you do with your life, you will always be a normal man. In fact, better than normal.\u201d I got up, walked over to him, and gave him a hug, which he stiffly accepted (the usual for him). \u00a0\nHe left then, book in hand, and I couldn\u2019t help but cry. I always think about my son\u2019s future and how different things will be for him. But what I hadn\u2019t thought about is the now unmistakable fact that he is also thinking about his future, his adulthood. And then I remembered something that I had forgotten to tell him. Something I wanted to make sure he knew.

{"date": "August 30, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tWe have a well-loved concert venue here in southern Oregon called Britt Festivals. I\u2019ve enjoyed seeing many shows there over the twenty years that I\u2019ve lived in this area. \u00a0It\u2019s an outdoor venue where patrons can bring their own picnic dinner, including beer and wine, and listen to great music on a hill under the stars. I try to go once every summer, and every time I go, I wish my boys could be with me. For most of the summer shows, they\u2019re in LA with their dad, but that, of course, is not the only issue. How do you take a sound-sensitive autistic teen to a concert? Would ear plugs be enough? Could he handle the sensory bombardment for over two hours? Would he even enjoy himself?\nInspired by reading about C going to a nightclub (!) last year, I decided that I wanted to take Nigel to a concert at Britt. I figured that we had a better chance of success with this venue since it is outdoors, and the sound level would not be contained within walls. He could also lie down on a blanket on the grass, read books, and eat food from home to increase his comfort level. And then when I heard that one of his favorite bands, CCR, was coming to town the week after he and Aidan would return from LA, I knew that I had a recipe for success. I bought three tickets.\nBut I also knew that in order for it to be successful, I needed to prepare him. I called him while he was still in LA and told him about the upcoming concert we\u2019d be attending, assuring him that we\u2019d bring ear plugs. He was excited about seeing his first concert and that it would be CCR! He was mildly disappointed that John Fogarty would not be present (the band is now called Creedence Clearwater Revisited), but he was still very motivated to go. A few days before the concert, I showed him the website of the venue, with a map showing the grounds and the lawn area where we would be sitting. I explained to him that even though we had tickets, we still needed to wait in line for at least an hour to get good lawn seats, and that once we got our seats, we would need to wait an hour and a half before the concert started. Then I had to explain the concept of an \u201copening band\u201d and field questions about why there would be one before CCR took the stage.\nSo we packed lots of food, beverages, books, National Geographics, and our magnetic portable chess game. Rain was forecasted for that one day of the week (damn!), so I packed umbrellas and jackets. And of course \u2013 the ear plugs. It rained just a little while we were waiting for our seats, and Nigel took it in stride under an umbrella. Finally we went inside, found a good spot, and spread out our blanket. We read for a while and relaxed, and when the music started, Nigel and I were in the middle of a chess game. His eyes grew huge, and he said, \u201cQuick, Mom! The ear plugs!\u201d He put them in and adjusted to the sound level. I was relieved.\nBut I was happiest when I saw how much Nigel enjoyed the concert. The vocalist, John Tristao, met with Nigel\u2019s approval by doing an amazing job of recreating Fogarty\u2019s\u00a0distinctive voice.\u00a0Nigel kept leaning over to me, making little comments like \u201cThey are using \u201860s graphics on the backdrop,\u201d \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in the \u201870s,\u201d and \u201cI bet the aliens can see this concert from outer space.\u201d I loved when they played \u201cHey Tonight,\u201d and Nigel looked up and said to me, \u201cThe stars are perfect with this.\u201d I had been worried that he would merely tolerate the concert, or that he wouldn\u2019t engage. But he got up and danced, waved his arms in the air, cheered quietly, and even sang along. Seeing him mouth the words \u201cI wanna know . . . have you ever seen the rain . . . comin\u2019 down on a sunny day?\u201d brought tears to my eyes. When the concert was over, I asked him, \u201cWhat did you think of that?\u201d and he said, \u201cThat was rockin\u2019 awesome!!\u201d with the most enthusiasm I\u2019ve ever heard.\nIn the middle of their set, the band did some introductions, and the drummer, Doug Clifford, who was in the band at the beginning, told the story of how they met in seventh grade and dreamed of being in a rock band. He told of their success as musicians, eventually having two number one albums on the charts. And at the end of his short, inspirational talk, he urged the audience, \u201cHold onto your dream.\u201d I really needed to hear that. I think we all do.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://brittfest.org/brittinfo", "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/12/night-to-remember.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creedence_Clearwater_Revisited"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/08/30/long-as-i-can-see-the-light/", "title": "Long As I Can See the Light"},

He has a new case manager and new teachers who are all still getting to know him, his strengths, and his needs. He has a full load of classes and a couple of self-chosen extra-curricular activities, including being on the school\u2019s wrestling team, which he dreamed of doing for many years. I am, of course, very proud that he achieved that, and of everything he\u2019s accomplished. He has come so far from his non-verbal, sensory-agony days.\nAnd fortunately, I like his new case manager. She quickly assessed my son\u2019s needs and has worked hard to meet them. I am very appreciative of her work and her attention to my son. She recently emailed me to go over a few issues, including how to help him participate more during wrestling practice. Among other things, she wrote, \u201c[The coach] does not have a lot of experience with students with significant disabilities.\u201d \nAnd it hit me hard. That phrase \u2013 \u201csignificant disabilities\u201d \u2013 is heavy. It was, of course, not meant in a negative way. But it smacks a parent in the face. It\u2019s a harsh reality check, even twelve years post-diagnosis. That phrase takes my recent hopes for a possible semi-independent adulthood for my son and dashes them to pieces. It takes me back to square one, when he was three years old and we received a diagnosis of classic autism, and again at age five, with a different doctor and two years of intensive therapy under our belts \u2013 same diagnosis. My head reeled again as it did so long ago. Significant disabilities, even at age 15, even after all the work he\u2019s done, all the years of continuous therapy, all the parental heartache. \u201cSignificant\u201d must be somewhere in between \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201csevere.\u201d And \u201csignificant disabilities\u201d do not induce much hope.\nDays pass. I have been walking around in a melancholy haze caused by two seemingly innocuous words. They are truthful, after all. I realize that his case manager sees a 15-year-old who needs constant one-on-one assistance in all of his classes, two periods a day in the resource room for help with in-class work and assignments, daily pull-outs from his mainstream classes, ongoing social skills and speech therapy, daily medication for his behavior, curriculum modification, and various other accommodations that I am constantly grateful are available to him. I can\u2019t deny that all of that does, indeed, point to \u201csignificant disabilities,\u201d just as how his needs when he was first diagnosed pointed to the same.\nI know that my son\u2019s case manager meant no harm in what she wrote; she merely stated a fact, and I certainly don\u2019t hold it against her. But she doesn\u2019t know his history. What she doesn\u2019t see is a 15-year-old who, despite great difficulty in learning to talk and filter severe sensory issues, despite enduring years of bullying, among countless other challenges, has always gone to great lengths to learn to work with his autism and to function as well as he does. He always tries. He wants to live his best life as much as I want him to. I find that significant too.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/12/20/significant/", "title": "Significant"},
{"date": "December 17, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nI am relieved to report that I am almost back to normal, after being sick for a full week. I haven\u2019t been that sick in over eight years! In recent years, I\u2019d been guilty of taking my health for granted \u2013 you know how when you\u2019re well, you sort of forget what it\u2019s like to be sick? Well, I do, since I\u2019m not sick that often. Let me tell you, I will definitely be more conscious of my good health from now on.\nBut something else happened while I was sick, something I hadn\u2019t expected. Included in all of the wonderful get-well wishes I received from my friends and family (thank you, everyone!) was a little advice in Carrie\u2019s comment:\u00a0 \u201c. . . in the meantime, try to enjoy the down time!\u201d It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever thought of doing while sick; it just either didn\u2019t occur to me or wasn\u2019t an option in the past, when the boys were younger. And granted, I still had to drag myself out of bed this week to get them off to school, pick them up, and make their dinner. \u00a0But aside from that, I actually took it easy. It\u2019s sad how I have to get really sick before I force myself to slow down \u2013 because by then it\u2019s not a choice. And so, I found myself with a little down time. I felt pretty lousy during it, but at one point I just sat on the couch, wrapped in my soft, warm robe with a down blanket over that. I drank a cup of tea. And I did nothing else. I just sat there. What an experience!\nI just sat there and tried not to think about much of anything, like some of my sporadic attempts at meditating (which I haven\u2019t done for a very long time). Thoughts would come, I would acknowledge them, and let them go. Thoughts of Nigel\u2019s future, of my own, and how intertwined they will be. But the great part was that I didn\u2019t attach any emotions to the thoughts, which was very different for me. Usually all of my thoughts have emotions attached to them. I can easily get emotional about things that have never even happened, just by thinking about the possibility of them. But somehow the illness gave me a sense of distance \u2013 a bit of a novelty, I must say.\nSo I rested. I read. I drank a lot of herbal tea. I forced myself to stay away from the computer. For the first time ever, I read the current National Geographic issue before the new one arrived (barely \u2013 the new one arrived today and it looks amazing). I noticed that National Geographic does not use a hyphen in \u201cemail,\u201d so now I feel justified in not doing so. Who knows if I would have noticed that had I not been sick? All these hidden benefits \u2013 down time, thoughts without emotion, proofreading insight. I\u2019ve been missing out.\nBut now it\u2019s back to the grind \u2013 and Christmas a week away, no less. Fortunately, because I had pushed myself prior to getting sick, I have nearly all of my shopping done. And although I\u2019m not completely 100%, I feel calmer than I did a week ago. I feel sane. I feel like I\u2019m ready for the busyness of having holiday guests, cooking and baking, and getting the boys ready to go to LA to visit their dad. A lot to do, but I am rested and ready. I didn\u2019t see it coming (getting sick) and thought I would totally fall behind, but it turned out all right after all, as things often do when you don\u2019t fight what is. Sometimes, you get the rest you need, and you might even learn something while you\u2019re at it.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://fully-caffeinated.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/12/17/down-time/", "title": "Down Time"},

{"date": "October 4, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\u201cHow old was I when I started to talk?\u201d Nigel asked me one day last week as we drove to the grocery store.\n\u201cYou were five when you started,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut it took several years of learning before you could talk as well as you can now.\u201d I waited for more questions, but that was all he seemed to want to know at the moment. I asked him if he could remember how it was for him before he could talk, if he remembered what it was like when his hearing was so sensitive that many sounds were painful to him, and he said no. \u201cI don\u2019t remember those days.\u201d\nBut the fact that he talks now, and that he goes online to watch YouTube videos, makes me worry that someday he might stumble across the \u201cI Am Autism\u201d video. And since he is aware of the fact that his parents separated within a year of his autism diagnosis, and then divorced, how will he feel when he hears the ominous voice saying, \u201d . . . I will make sure that your marriage fails\u201c? His self-esteem is fragile enough, and his own acceptance of his autism has been difficult at best. This video would destroy any gains he might have made. I couldn\u2019t stand for that. Nor do I ever want him to feel responsible for his parents\u2019 divorce.\nSo tonight, while relaxing on the couch, I gently broach the subject by asking him if he\u2019d ever seen any videos about autism. He tells me that he hasn\u2019t looked, and I say that\u2019s fine. Then I describe the \u201cI Am Autism\u201d video. I tell him that it takes the challenging and difficult aspects of autism and talks about them in a threatening tone. That it blames divorce on autism.\nNigel says, \u201cProbably the people who think that are just insecure.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Nigel,\u201d I say, stunned. \u00a0\u201cI think you\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d Where did that come from? How could he instinctively know that? His keen, sensible awareness shocks me. But I have to continue. \u201cI just want to make sure that you would never think that your autism was the cause of your dad\u2019s and my divorce.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he states.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause your autism had nothing to do with the divorce.\u201d And then, because we seem to be on a roll, I go on. \u201cI don\u2019t want your self-esteem to suffer because of videos like that. Autism is challenging and difficult sometimes, as you know, but it\u2019s part of your personality and what makes you so unique. But I know sometimes it\u2019s hard for you to accept it. I remember a year or two ago, you would get upset sometimes and say that you hated the autism and wanted to rip it out of your head \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cWell, that was just a phase,\u201d Nigel interjects.\n\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t feel that way anymore?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I feel fine about it now.\u201d\nI reach over to hug him, and he stiffly accepts. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to hear that,\u201d I tell him, my voice catching. For years, autism had caused self-loathing for my son. Maybe something like\u00a0that should have been mentioned in the video. Maybe it should have been mentioned that autism is not just a struggle for the family members. It\u2019s an even bigger struggle for the ones who have it. Yet they continue to find ways to work with their autism, not against it. And with time, therapy, and a lot of hard work, they can even come to accept it. \u00a0\u00a0\nI know that we still have a long way to go. I know that the social issues are going to be a continuing source of strife for my son, just as the sensory issues and language deficit used to be. But there\u2019s one huge thing in place that\u2019s going to help with that \u2013 his self-esteem. And that\u2019s one good thing about the \u201cI Am Autism\u201d video \u2013 it was the catalyst for an amazing conversation with my son. Not only do I feel better knowing that he doesn\u2019t blame himself for his parents\u2019 divorce,\u00a0 but he revealed to me that he has accepted his autism. He no longer feels that it makes him defective. He knows that it makes him different, and he\u2019s okay with that. I feel fine about it now, he says.\nThe air in our home is not the same tonight. A threshold has been crossed, a truce declared. There is a calmness I don\u2019t recall feeling before. A new ease. Contentment.\nI smile, remembering. \u201cJust a phase\u201d he said. \u00a0\u2013 Oh, how I love him.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDdcDlQVYtM"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/10/04/one-good-thing/", "title": "One Good Thing"},
{"date": "November 5, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nThis morning, like every other weekday morning, Nigel got on his bike to go to school, Aidan walked to the bus stop to be picked up to go to his school, and I got in my car to go to work. A few miles down the road, I pulled up to the intersection and into the left turn pocket that leads out to the freeway. I could barely see the signal because the sun was directly behind it, blinding me. I tilted my head so that most of my vision was shaded by the car\u2019s visor, and the little red arrow was faintly visible in the thin space between the visor and my rear view mirror. A moment later I could barely make out the little arrow changing from red to green, and I blindly drove forward. I felt like I was driving into the sun.\nAnd it struck me, as I got on the freeway, that for the past twelve years since my son\u2019s diagnosis, that\u2019s exactly how it\u2019s been. That\u2019s how it is for all of us. We are driving into the sun. There are no rules about raising a child with autism! No tried and true methods. What works for one child doesn\u2019t work for another. Because I pursued intensive (but non-aversive) ABA treatments for my son so that we could increase his chances of learning to talk, and then medication to help regulate his behavior, does not mean that I do not accept him as he is. Because someone else does not pursue various therapies does not mean that they do not want to help their child. Because I say that my son \u201cis autistic\u201d does not by any means indicate that I don\u2019t think that there is \u201cso much more to him\u201d than that. Because other parents prefer to say that their children \u201chave autism\u201d does not by any means indicate that they\u2019re in denial. Both ways are valid \u2013 and appropriate. There are no rules with autism. We are all living with it the best way we can.\nAt work a while later, I received an e-mail with a link to this New York Times article. Here\u2019s the crux of it: \u201cThough it [Asperger\u2019s] became an official part of the medical lexicon only in 1994, the experts who are revising psychiatry\u2019s diagnostic manual have proposed to eliminate it from the new edition, due out in 2012.\u201d How does that grab you? I knew that the DSM was up for revision, but I never thought that this was the way it would go. And you know what that tells me? It tells me that we parents aren\u2019t the only ones driving into the sun. If the \u201cexperts\u201d don\u2019t know how to effectively define all of autism\u2019s manifestations, where does that leave us?\nIt leaves us right where we\u2019ve always been, doing what we\u2019re doing, forging ahead even when we\u2019re not sure if we can. Damning the torpedoes and hoping for the best. Trying everything \u2013 or not. Because the bottom line is that we have to do what feels right to us, not what neighbors or relatives think we should do. Certainly not what \u201cexperts\u201d tell us to do. Instead, we network, we support each other and our different choices. We respect one another as parents of autistic children, and as parents of children with autism. Because whether some of us go to the left and some of us go to the right, we\u2019re all just figuring it out as we go, trying to live our best lives. And if we all arrive at the same destination, does it matter how we get there?\nIt\u2019s like with the boys and me this morning, every morning. We all go our separate ways, but at the end of the day, we are home, happy, together. We may do a little driving into the sun while we\u2019re out there, but the day still passes, and we have the harbor of one another to see us through.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/health/03asperger.html?_r=2&scp=1&sq=Use%20of%20Aspergers%20heading%20for%20psychiatric%20obsolescence&st=cse"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/11/05/driving-into-the-sun/", "title": "Driving into the Sun"},
{"date": "December 28, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tThe hardest part of waiting is not knowing how long you\u2019ll have to wait. \u2013 Aidan, age 13\nCome on, say it with me: \u201cI will never spend Christmas in an airport.\u201d That\u2019s what I\u2019d said all of my adult life and certainly believed that I never would. Then, after eight years of transporting my children 700 miles back and forth to LA to visit their father and dealing with harsh \u2013 and scary \u2013 winter driving conditions, we decided to take advantage of a new economy airline that offered non-stop flights to LAX from our little airport in Medford, Oregon. The boys were excited about their first solo flight, Nigel had been prepped about not loudly saying things like \u201cCan\u2019t these people just start moving?!\u201d while waiting to de-plane, and not mentioning 9/11 to airport security, and I was thrilled at the prospect of avoiding the 700-mile drive during winter. \u00a0The only catch was that the economy airline only flew on Fridays and Mondays. The ticket cost for the Monday after Christmas was, for some reason, $100 higher (for each person) than for the flight on Christmas Day. At a little airport serviced by only four airlines, I thought, how bad could it be?\nWe sat there for six hours, dear reader, waiting for the fog to clear. We got there at 11:30 AM, an hour and a half before take-off, and did not leave that airport until 5:30 PM, when they finally announced that the flight had been canceled. The really maddening thing was that\u00a0the three other airlines were all landing and taking off just fine, but the economy airline had stricter regulations than the other airlines. The officials kept telling us that \u201cthey\u2019re circling,\u201d \u201cthe pilot is waiting to attempt a landing,\u201d and so on. For six hours. Six hours of watching other planes land, board new passengers, and take off. Six hours of crying toddlers (Nigel covered his ears a lot), monotonous recorded airport announcements about not leaving bags unattended and using hand sanitizers \u201cduring cold and flu season,\u201d and even a boisterous youth minister who took it upon himself to try to engage everyone and loudly started singing Christmas carols right behind my head. And Nigel\u2019s. Nigel actually handled it better than I did.\nThe next morning we trundled back to the airport. The fog was worse than the day before. When we stepped up to the counter we were told that they had already delayed the flight, and there was no guarantee that the fog would clear by the delayed time either. The forecast was for fog all day. We couldn\u2019t spend another day in the airport, not even knowing how long we\u2019d have to wait, or if they would even fly at all. We walked back to the car and I called their dad. We decided to drive and meet half-way, as we\u2019ve done several times a year for eight years. Eleven hours in the car. No one, especially Nigel, was happy about it, but we braced ourselves and got on the road.\nOf course, the day after Christmas is the worst day to drive. I-5 was two long streams of cars, northbound and southbound. Three hours into the drive, a minivan nearly merged into me. I braked, swerved to avoid it, and felt sick as fear and adrenaline coursed through me. We were inches away from being in the middle of a pile-up at 75 miles per hour. It was so hard to keep it together until the next off-ramp, where we stopped to refuel and\u00a0get lunch. I sat\u00a0in the restaurant\u00a0calming myself, recuperating, relieved and grateful, trying to put the what-ifs out of my mind. We are truly, utterly blessed.\nI called my mom, who lives near the airport, and she said that they were still socked in with fog, three hours after the boys were supposed to fly. She\u2019d heard no planes coming or going. The thought that we would still be sitting in that airport for the second day in a row spurred me on. I felt much better knowing that we had done the right thing by driving. After we got back on the freeway, I saw a sign that made me want to joke with the boys. It was one of those green and white official highway mileage signs, and it read, \u00a0Sacramento 17, Los Angeles 391.\n\u201cLook, guys!\u201d I said. \u201cOnly 391 more miles to LA!\u201d\nAidan, seated next to me, did not skip a beat. \u201cYay! We\u2019re almost there!\u201d\nEven Nigel chuckled in the back. \u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0A year ago, he was just learning to recognize the humor in sarcasm. I think he\u2019s got it now.\nAnd at least, as I told Aidan, with driving they know how long they have to wait. They know exactly how many hours it takes to get from our house to Dad\u2019s house (eleven, including a quick stop for lunch). They see the familiar landmarks along the way, they recognize the various gas stations we use. After eight years, they know every bend in the road, all 700 miles of it. And the best part of waiting, I tell them, is knowing who\u2019s waiting for you when you get there.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/12/28/christmas-in-an-airport/", "title": "Christmas in an Airport"},
{"date": "October 1, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tHaving a special needs child growing up in my home has taught me more about trust than any other element of my life. Especially with my particular child having such an independent spirit and wanting to do things on his own. The problem is that he does not always have the coping tools and social understanding necessary to navigate many situations he could encounter. And so, as he has gotten older and has started wanting to go places on his own, I have learned that lecturing him on safety issues and wringing my hands while he\u2019s gone are not the best ways to cope with the experience.\nOf course, all good parents in general are concerned about their children\u2019s safety and well-being when they\u2019re out doing something on their own. I know how it is with a non-autistic child because I have one. I know that even though I have just as much concern for his welfare, the worry is mitigated. He can handle himself far better in situations where other people are involved, which is almost any situation when someone\u2019s away from home. I don\u2019t worry about him causing problems, or about his behavior escalating. I don\u2019t worry about him reacting violently to insects flying near him. I don\u2019t worry about someone tricking him into doing something unsafe or unlawful. And I\u2019m just as relieved when he gets home safely, but while he\u2019s gone, the worry seems more manageable.\nFor two years now, my autistic teen has been asking me to let him ride his bike to the local grocery store alone. And for many reasons, I kept putting it off. I just didn\u2019t feel that he was ready. Now, since he recently started riding his bike to and from school every day and has demonstrated that he can use a cell phone properly, I can no longer justify not letting him ride to the store, which is just a little farther away than the school. \u00a0One afternoon last week, he asked me to let him ride his bike to the store. I put it off, telling him he had to do his chores first. He did them in record time and asked me again, assuring me that he\u2019d be careful. Out of stalling material, I literally wrung my hands and began breathing rapidly, like the beginnings of a panic attack. Nigel noticed.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.\nI hemmed and hawed. Finally, I said it. \u201cI just wish you didn\u2019t want to do this, Nigel. It worries me.\u201d\nHe paused, and then he made eye contact and said, in his flat but beautiful voice, \u201cMom, sometimes you just have to trust me.\u201d\nI almost gasped. A lump quickly formed in my throat. It was one of those rare lucid moments when he says something so simple, yet so profound. Somehow, he knew exactly what to say. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I conceded. \u201cI think you\u2019re ready to do this.\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d he said in the same resolute tone.\nWe then did a quick \u201cverbal social story,\u201d since these days he rarely needs them to be written. I verbally walked him through the route he would ride, told him where to lock up his bike, discussed what he would do in the store, and suggested that he not stop to talk to anyone along the way. He could briefly answer a question if someone asked, but then come straight home. We figured out how much time he would need to get there, get his Silly Putty, and come back. Then he left, and I watched him out the window as he rode away. I visualized a herd of angels surrounding him.\nWhile he was gone, I took his advice. I worked at my desk and just trusted. I trusted that he could do this, trusted that he would be all right. And to my surprise, I actually believed it. I did so well that right about the time I thought to check the time, I heard him rattle the side gate to indicate that he was home, putting his bike away. My eyes immediately welled up and I patted them dry as I rose from my desk. Nigel strode into the house and I went to greet him.\n\u201cI did it, Mom,\u201d he said calmly, with a hint of pride. \u201cSee? I told you I would be fine.\u201d\n\u201cYou did and you are,\u201d I said, putting my arm around his tall, warm frame. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for letting me go.\u201d\nI tried not to get misty-eyed again. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, honey,\u201d I said. \u00a0How did he know that that\u2019s the hardest part of trusting \u2013 the letting go? That, as I discovered that afternoon, it\u2019s also the most rewarding?\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/10/01/trust/", "title": "Trust"},
{"date": "November 8, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tFrom time to time I receive e-mails from readers asking how I\u2019m doing, often about things that don\u2019t necessarily pertain to this blog, which is totally fine. Here, I write mostly about my experiences raising my two boys, one of whom has autism. I don\u2019t go into much personal stuff because I think of this blog as a resource for other parents. But then I realized that when I read other blogs, one of the things I truly enjoy is a post on a more personal level. \u00a0I feel like I get to know the blogger a little better, identify with him or her, and often learn something new. And since I\u00a0usually enjoy reading\u00a0the personal bits, I figured that some of my readers might like that too.\nSo, in that vein, I\u2019ve decided to occasionally write some personal posts to address those \u201ctouching base\u201d e-mails that I receive. For example, I am often asked how my writing is coming along, especially since I\u2019ve been threatening to publish a book for over a year now. Well, as with everything else in my life that doesn\u2019t have to do with work and raising kids, it\u2019s coming along slowly. I\u2019m close, though! Really close! I just have a few more things to iron out, and then it\u2019s off to the printer! I had considered having another editor look at it, but I gave it some careful consideration and think that I just need to bite the bullet and get it out there. It\u2019s time (almost).\nHere\u2019s another popular question \u2013 am I dating now? And the answer is no. I have not dated for a year. For a while now I\u2019ve been telling myself that I don\u2019t have time to date, which is mostly true. But I\u2019m also not that impressed with the caliber of single men I\u2019ve met lately. And here\u2019s a little story to illustrate that point. Okay, so Saturday night I go out with a friend of mine, another full-time single mom. It\u2019s been weeks since either one of us has gotten out of our homes other than for work, errands, or appointments. A band is playing at a local pub, so we sit down at the bar and have a drink. After a few minutes, the guy next to me starts chatting me up. He seems okay, apparently a recently (by my standards) single dad whose kids are the same ages as mine. He\u2019s even from the LA area, as I am, so I think those are pretty cool things to have in common. We keep talking, and my friend joins in. The three of us talk about our six collective kids, we make jokes, we\u2019re having a good time. And then \u2013 brace yourselves \u2013 the guy blurts out, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m really over the whole kid thing.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nReally? You\u2019re hitting on a single mom of two kids, and you think a line like that is gonna get you anywhere?\nI was so shocked that I couldn\u2019t even say anything. My friend, however, had a few choice words to say, including, \u201cHow sad for your kids\u201d as we turned on our heels and walked out. I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m expecting to meet a great guy in a pub. I wasn\u2019t expecting to meet anyone that night, nor was I wanting to. I just wanted to go out and kick back with my friend. Instead, we meet a jerk who\u2019s been a single dad for three years and thinks he\u2019s going to impress me by complaining about it and insulting good parents everywhere. Next!\nIn other news, I recently received the Friendly Blogger award from my friend Nicki at Slow Down, Gym Shoe. Nicki was a recipient of the\u00a0Lemonade award that I passed on to her for her positive outlook. Thanks for this\u00a0cool award,\u00a0Nicki!\n\nOne of the rules for accepting the Friendly Blogger award is to post the most recent photo of yourself, so again \u2013 brace yourselves:\n\u00a0\nAnd that\u2019s the lowdown \u2013 not much success in the writing, dating, and portrait-taking departments.

{"date": "December 30, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nPart of the big let-down for Nigel and Aidan not making their flight to LA on Christmas was that their dad had purchased tickets for them to see Avatar that night. He canceled those tickets and definitely planned to take them at some point during their visit, of course. However, knowing that it\u2019s a three-hour movie, I questioned whether Nigel would be able to sit through all of it \u2013 he usually doesn\u2019t make it all the way through movies in the theater. He often needs a break from the sensory bombardment of a movie theater and has to take a few walks during the film.\nBut something tells me that he\u2019ll sit through all of this one. I know because I saw it tonight, and I was enraptured. I got off work early to go see a late afternoon show, and it was sold out on a Tuesday. So I purchased a ticket for the 7 PM show and came back later. I, meaning myself. Flying solo. I am uber-introvert, going to movies alone and enjoying it. (I\u2019ve taken myself out to dinner before, too.) I show up at the theater an hour early to get a good seat, and there is already a huge line. Even so, I am able to sit near the center, about three-fourths of the way back, which is my favorite area. I sit down next to a guy in his twenties with a scruffy goatee and watch as the theater fills to capacity. Moments later, I realize that not only is he scruffy, he stinks. I am accosted by the low-grade, but unmistakable, scent of permeating old sweat. As soon as I make this distasteful realization, another guy in his twenties with a full beard sits in the empty seat on the other side of me. They appear to not know each other, but they both are clearly hygienically challenged. The bearded one stinks too.\nAre you kidding me? I yell in my head. What are the freaking odds? This is what I get for going to the movies alone! I get boxed in by two guys who are taking some time off from bathing. My olfactory sense is completely assaulted, and I momentarily consider leaving. How am I going to enjoy the movie while constantly inhaling these noxious fumes? But I tell myself that feces and vomit would be far worse and decide to employ shallow breathing and \u201ctune out\u201d the BO surrounding me.\nAnd, no, nothing magical happened during the movie with regard to the stench. I wasn\u2019t so enraptured by the movie that I didn\u2019t stop every ten minutes or so and still notice the air around me. But it was tolerable, if only because I enjoyed the movie so much. Without going into a whole commentary about its humanitarian/environmentalist theme, I will say that it really affected me. What struck me the most is how we, as a whole, are perilously close to losing our sense of connectedness. I drove home crying, and it wasn\u2019t because I\u2019d been smelling old sweat for three hours.\nI got home too late to call the boys. For some reason, I desperately want to talk to them about this movie, get their take on it. It\u2019s obvious \u2013 missing them, I yearn to connect with them. But then I realize that I don\u2019t need the phone to be connected to them. I can feel it at my core \u2013 the constant connectedness I have with them. It is always there. I know that they are well and having fun with their dad,\u00a0while I enjoy some time alone. And I\u2019m breathing more deeply now, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/12/30/flying-solo-part-1/", "title": "Flying Solo, Part 1"},
{"date": "November 11, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nSeven years ago, Nigel started a tradition at age eight that we still observe today. Every Veterans Day, when I get home from work (because I don\u2019t work for the postal service), we go to our local cemetery \u201cto pay our respects,\u201d Nigel says. He didn\u2019t say that the first few years we went (because he couldn\u2019t), but I\u2019m sure the sentiment was always there. It was his idea, after all.\nFrom a young age, Nigel has been interested in military history. He has books on at least eight major wars, does research online, and watches the History Channel. It\u2019s become somewhat of an obsession. But even before he got his books and computer, he had a deep, abiding respect for soldiers. He knows that his father was in the Army, as well as his grandfather. Two of his great-grandfathers were Marines who served in World War II. And he had two great-great-grandfathers who fought in World War I. But long before he knew any of this, he came to me on Veterans Day and asked if we could go to the cemetery.\nI remember that day, sunny, but cool. I marveled at his request \u2013 \u201cCan we go to the cemetery?\u201d \u2013 worded so well at a time when he still had great difficulty with sentence structure and correct pronoun usage. Ordinarily, he might have asked, \u201cYou go to the cemetery?\u201d because he constantly said \u201cyou\u201d when he meant \u201cI.\u201d But this was clearly to be a joint venture.\n\u201cSure,\u201d I told him, wondering what he had in mind. \u201cGo get your jacket on.\u201d And he ran off to do so.\nOur little town is one of the older towns in southern Oregon, and our cemetery has tombstones from the 1800s in it. As we strolled through the entrance gate, I glanced up at the sunlight filtering through the trees, took a deep breath, and began leisurely browsing the gravesites. Nigel\u2019s gait, however, was more purposeful. He strode down the main walkway and made a beeline for the military marker closer to the rear of the cemetery. I quickened my pace to keep up.\nAs we neared the stone and metal memorial marker, I noticed two men seated on a bench next to it. I hoped that Nigel wouldn\u2019t start climbing on the five-foot-high marker. In those days, I had no idea what to expect from him. But I needn\u2019t have worried.\nHe stood in front of it and saluted.\nMy breath caught in my throat, but I had to quickly regain my composure because one of the men had asked Nigel a question, something about having family in the military. And Nigel, characteristically of that time, was not responding. I walked over and briefly laid out the family history.\n\u201cI was in Vietnam,\u201d the man said.\nNigel immediately turned to him. He made eye contact with a complete stranger, and then Nigel began to slowly unzip his own jacket. Again, I wondered what to expect. I stood at the ready, not sure if I\u2019d be translating or intervening or explaining. I\u2019ve had to do so much of that over the years, in so many situations.\nNigel unzipped his jacket down to his abdomen, and then slowly, deliberately, using both hands he pulled his jacket to the sides of his chest, a la Superman, to reveal his shirt. It was green camouflage. When I had sent him to get his jacket before leaving the house, unbeknownst to me, he had changed shirts. And he reverently showed it to the veteran in his presence.\n\u201cOhh!\u201d the man exclaimed, chuckling. \u201cYou wanna be a soldier too?\u201d\nNigel nodded.\n\u201cWell, I bet you\u2019ll be a good one.\u201d\nI thanked the man and bid him a good day, and Nigel and I began to walk home through the filtered sunlight,\u00a0fallen leaves crunching beneath our feet. I put my arm around him and told him that I was proud of him for being so respectful. And I knew, without a doubt, that whether he ever enters the military or not, Nigel would always be a good soldier.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/11/11/a-good-soldier/", "title": "A Good Soldier"},
{"date": "November 22, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nAidan, seated next to me in the booth of a Mexican restaurant, says, \u201cI have a joke for you, Nigel.\u201d\nNigel, seated across from us on the other side of the booth, asks, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cA plane crashes on the border of California and Mexico. Where do you bury the survivors?\u201d\nI have heard this one before. And when a visually-oriented person hears it, as opposed to reading it, that person, especially if he happens to be interested in disasters of all kinds, will not hear the word \u201csurvivors.\u201d He will hear \u201cplane\u201d and \u201ccrashes\u201d and \u201cborder of California and Mexico,\u201d and he will hear \u201cbury.\u201d And he will matter-of-factly answer, \u201cThey should be buried in the country they are from.\u201d\nAnd\u00a0Aidan smugly delivers the punch line: \u201cYou don\u2019t bury survivors.\u201d\nIf Nigel had read it somewhere, had seen it in print, he would have immediately caught the trick. But verbally, of course, it\u2019s lost on him. He has to be reminded that the word \u201csurvivors\u201d is part of the equation, and then he understands. He calmly takes it in stride, filing it away for future reference.\nMeanwhile, what is not lost on me is the fact that all of this is taking place in a busy restaurant. Not too long ago, going to restaurants was highly problematic. Up until about seven years of age, Nigel\u2019s sensory issues were so crippling that he would writhe on the floor, wailing in agony whenever I tried to take him into a restaurant. He couldn\u2019t handle all the people and their respective sounds, the background music over the speaker system, the clanking of dishes, glasses, and silverware, crying babies, whirring fans, lights, and whatever else affected him. God forbid he should need to go to the bathroom with its echo-inducing walls, air hand driers, and loud toilets. God forbid the staff should decide to vacuum around the table right next to ours.\nYet, tonight at the Mexican restaurant, every single one of those things happened. Every one of those things \u2013 except Nigel writhing and wailing on the floor. That\u2019s right \u2013 he was completely fine tonight. When he was around eight or nine years old, things seemed to get a little easier for him (except for the bathrooms and vacuum cleaners), and we could usually experience a successful fifteen minutes in a restaurant. After fifteen minutes or so, his sensory issues would reach a build-up point, and then he just couldn\u2019t take any more. He\u2019d have to crawl under our table (this, at age twelve, did not look okay to staff and other patrons, but hey! That\u2019s what the boy needed to do). At least the writhing and wailing had stopped by that age.\nNow, however, blessed Now, he can eat a full meal in a restaurant without any discomfort or distress. Unfortunately, my ASD-parent PTSD is always affecting me, and I cringe at every single sound. The music, the babies, the clanking. When they bring out that damned vacuum cleaner right next to our table (Gah! Why must they do that? Why?! We\u2019re eating, for God\u2019s sake!), I about have a heart attack. But Nigel is completely unfazed. No ear plugs. No covering his ears. No diving under the table. He calmly munches on chips and salsa while he talks with his brother about G-force and physics. The old adage about things changing? In our case, they don\u2019t stay the same. And I, for one, am relieved.\nAidan continues with his next joke. \u201cImagine you\u2019re in a box with a pig and a stick. How do you get out of the box?\u201d\nNigel briefly contemplates, then answers, \u201cI would hit the pig with the stick until he gets mad enough to break down a side of the box, then I could get out.\u201d\nAidan says, \u201cStop imagining. If you\u2019re imagining that you\u2019re in a box, just stop imagining and then you won\u2019t be in it anymore.\u201d\nNigel smiles and files that one away too.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/11/22/the-more-things-change/", "title": "The More Things Change"},
{"date": "November 20, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nWhat kind of shoes are these and what\u2019s the seven-year story behind them?\n*\nPicture a little boy, four years old, with wavy, light brown hair and captivating hazel eyes, who cannot talk. He tries to play with other children by bumping into them and laughing. He doesn\u2019t know how to play, but he tries. He sees children laughing and playing together as a group, so in his mind, he thinks they are bumping into each other, and he believes that this is the way to play. The other children don\u2019t understand. They think that he is being mean, that he is pushing them and laughing at them. All he wants is to join in. And he craves physical contact to meet his proprioceptive needs. \nPicture the same little boy, now in second grade. He is talking, although he still exhibits echolalia and mixes up pronouns and word order. This, along with his sensory issues and behavioral challenges, makes it rather difficult to have friends, but he still tries, usually by initiating physical contact. One day, while on a class field trip (accompanied by his one-on-one aide) to the local high school, he visits the Wrestling Room. He is entranced. Though not able to verbalize it yet, he consciously vows that he will attend this high school and be on the wrestling team.\nNow picture that same boy at age fifteen. His darker brown hair has developed more pronounced curls, but his eyes are still as captivating. He has learned, through social skills classes and personal experience, that physical contact is best reserved for roughhousing with friends that he\u2019s known for a long time. Then the day comes, two months into his freshman year, when he signs up for the wrestling team. He comes home from school and tells his mother, using perfect sentence structure, that he needs to get a physical done as soon as possible so that he will be allowed to \u201cget on the mats\u201d at practice. He reminds her of how he\u2019s waited seven years to be on the high school wrestling team, and she tells him that she remembers. She remembers that day so long ago when she picked him up from school and his aide told her about the field trip and how much he loved the Wrestling Room. She remembers the various elementary school Christmas Programs that were held at the high school over the years and how, even though her son couldn\u2019t be in the program because of his sensory issues, they would walk by the Wrestling Room and he would tell her \u201cThat\u2019s what I am going to do when I go to this high school.\u201d And his mother, not sure if he could ever comprehend the rules of a sport and actually be on a team, but wanting to be supportive, would say in a positive tone, \u201cWe\u2019ll see!\u201d\nThey get the physical done, they buy the wrestling shoes, and the son starts diligently attending practice every day after school. They go to the Parent Night, and the mother approaches the coach at the end of the meeting to introduce herself. She is already impressed by the fact that, during the meeting, when her son asked a question that was a bit self-explanatory, the coach had answered him with genuine respect and patience. So she goes up later and shakes his hand and asks if he is familiar with her son\u2019s IEP for his autism. And the coach assures her that, yes, he has spoken with her son\u2019s case manager and is aware of his challenges. Then he tells her with such sincerity how well her son is doing. And the mother fights a lump in her throat as she tells the coach, \u201cHe\u2019s been wanting to do this for a long time,\u201d and thanks him, very much. \nNow picture the little boy\u2019s mother picking him up from wrestling practice the next evening. She pulls into the parking lot and sees his lean frame striding toward the car, wrestling shoes in hand. It strikes her that her son is on a sports team for the first time ever. And now she is picking him up from practice, just like all the other parents do with their sons. She sees a huge smile on her son\u2019s face as he nears the car. The lump returns and her eyes sparkle with tears. He has followed his dream and achieved his goal. He is on the high school wrestling team, and he loves it. \n He gets in the car and excitedly tells his mother about the techniques he is learning and how he\u2019s already pinned two people at practice! The mother, hoping that the darkness is hiding her watery eyes, tells him how proud she is of him. She asks him if wrestling is everything he thought it would be. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know we would have to learn tactics. But I like learning by doing.\u201d She asks him what his favorite part is about wrestling. \u201cThat I get to meet new friends. And they understand me.\u201d  The mother, hoping that her voice isn\u2019t shaking too much, tells him how great that is. And how glad she is to hear it.

We had a low turn-out, probably due to illness, but it was one of the best meetings we\u2019ve ever had. For one thing, two new members attended, so that was great. For another thing, they were the only two members who attended. And as much as I love when we have a big turn-out, when only three people are present, you can really talk.\nSince one of them was new to the area and the other one was new to the diagnosis, we started off by talking about local resources. It\u2019s a short list for our area, unfortunately, but I think I gave them a few good leads. We moved on to listing various topics of discussion that we can focus on for future meetings, topics that would be most helpful to everyone (since our group consists of parents of preschoolers to adults). I want this support group to be as beneficial as possible. And that led me to mention one of the topics that I\u2019d like to feature at a future meeting \u2013 the emotional issues we face as ASD parents. Usually that area is relegated to the professionals. But what if you can\u2019t afford a therapist or don\u2019t have the time to see one regularly? And if the therapist doesn\u2019t have a child on the spectrum, how are you going to feel that total support and understanding that you feel when you\u2019re talking with other ASD parents?\nOne of the new members, a mother of a 24-year-old son with Asperger\u2019s, opened up and talked about how hard it is receiving the wedding invitations and college graduation announcements of her friends\u2019 children. How difficult it is when your child doesn\u2019t meet the typical milestones. And I knew \u2013 oh, how I knew the emotions she described. It\u2019s not that our children have disappointed us \u2013 it\u2019s not that at all. It\u2019s that we wish things didn\u2019t have to be so hard for them, and for us. It\u2019s that we fear the future. For some of us, it starts with the not-pointing-at-things-to-show-them-to-us. Then there\u2019s the not-talking. For others, it\u2019s the not-potty-training or not-making-eye-contact. Or all of the above. And plenty more.\nBut then, while talking, we realized that our kids have different milestones, and that\u2019s okay. Because whether or not they ever meet those typical milestones, we celebrate the ones they do meet. Like, in Nigel\u2019s case, not shrieking in a public restroom \u2013 that was huge for me. Being mainstreamed in a regular classroom (with full-time one-on-one aides, but still \u2013 huge). Going to the grocery store without distress \u2013 anywhere, really. Those\u00a0are some of\u00a0my milestones. And only those close to us and other ASD parents can really get how huge those milestones are.\nTake for example, when I was at work yesterday. The boys were home because of Veterans Day, but Nigel needed to go to his school for wrestling practice (participation in a team sport \u2013 huge!) for two hours. Since he\u2019s been successful with riding his bike to and from school every day, I took a major leap of faith and thought that he could handle riding there and then home afterward. I told him he had to call me as soon as he got home to let me know. We calculated that he would be home by 10:30 and would call as soon as he put his bike away. Aidan would be home to let him in.\nSo I\u2019m at work and 10:30 rolls around. Of course, I\u2019ve been anxious pretty much the whole morning. But the phone rings right on time (big!), and it\u2019s him.\u00a0However, from the background noise, I can tell that he\u2019s not at home. Semi-panic, or pre-panic, sets in. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d I ask. He tells me that he\u2019s still at the school, that he was mistaken about the time practice started, which was an hour later than he\u2019d thought, so he wouldn\u2019t be home for another hour. So, even though his instructions had been to call me when he got home, he realized that he should call me at 10:30 anyway to let me know that the situation had changed. He didn\u2019t say that, but that\u2019s what happened. And I about fell out of my chair.\nI thanked him for being so responsible. I could barely get the words out. In shock, I turned to my co-worker to try to share the moment with her. Of course, she didn\u2019t get it at all. What\u2019s the big deal about a 15-year-old doing that? I tried to turn it into a teachable moment by describing my son\u2019s challenges and how autism affects him. Not a flicker of understanding.\nBut tonight at the meeting? Empathy. They totally got why that was huge without me explaining it. I felt validated. I felt understood. I didn\u2019t feel alone. And that, my friends, is the whole reason for a support group.\nWe have different milestones for our kids, but we do have them. And it\u2019s so affirming to know people who understand those milestones, and celebrate them with us. My co-worker has known me for five years and didn\u2019t understand. Those two women had known me for one hour, and they were celebrating with me. Best. Meeting. Ever. And that\u2019s a milestone too.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/11/13/different-milestones/", "title": "Different Milestones"},
{"date": "November 25, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nI was going to write a post about all the things in my life that I\u2019m thankful for. You know, sort of like those classroom assignments we\u2019d get while we were growing up, a few years after the handprint turkeys and construction paper pilgrim hats. I had the usual list going \u2013 my children, our health, my job, our home \u2013 the heavies. My extended family, of course, and my good friends, including my fellow bloggers and wonderful readers, those I know and those I don\u2019t. All of you have enhanced my life in numerous ways, and for that I am very thankful.\nMy ready-to-post list continued with the people in my life who have been most important in my children\u2019s lives \u2013 Nigel\u2019s case manager, his teachers, his speech and behavioral therapists, his new wrestling coach, and the Scoutmaster of his troop and all the Scout families who have been so patient and accepting of Nigel over the years, even when his behaviors were more difficult. Where would we be without these wonderful people? Where would we be without the doctor who finally, after many anxious weeks of multiple tests and screenings, identified Aidan\u2019s medical condition earlier this year? And the surgeon who skillfully removed the offending party? I am so very grateful. Words cannot express my appreciation.\nMy list extended in a broader, global sense to include my trip to Nepal a few months ago and the beautiful people involved with Knowledge for People and AutismCare Nepal. I am thankful to have had the opportunity to learn from them and work with them, and to have had such an amazing experience that enriched my life. Last, but in no way least, I am thankful for those who selflessly serve our country, who sacrifice time with their loved ones, on Thanksgiving and always. We owe them a huge debt of gratitude.\nI had thought about it last night before going to sleep and knew exactly what I wanted to write. I knew what I was thankful for and had the whole post planned. And then something happened this morning. Something happened that made me rethink my Thanksgiving post. In fact, it made me think outside the whole Thanksgiving box. I witnessed a near tragedy, and it shook me.\nSince Nigel has wrestling practice every day after school and finishes after dark, I drop him off in the morning and pick him up in the evening instead of having him ride his bike. This morning, I pulled up to the main entrance of the school and waited at the stop sign to turn into the driveway. A boy about Nigel\u2019s age started walking in the crosswalk in front of us. Across the intersection, a car suddenly began driving through. The driver, a middle-aged man, was headed right for the boy in the crosswalk and didn\u2019t see him. I gasped, frozen. NO! This was not going to happen! Nigel and I would not witness a boy get hit by a car! In a fraction of a second, I willed the driver to see the boy, to stop, stop, STOP! At the last possible moment, he slammed on his brakes and missed the boy.\nNigel did not seem to grasp the magnitude of what we had seen. In fact, when I asked him, \u201cDid you see that?\u201d he said, \u201cSee what?\u201d\u00a0Then the fact\u00a0hit me\u00a0that it could have been him. It could have been my son in the crosswalk. And while that boy was not my son, he\u2019s someone\u2019s son. Someone\u2019s son almost got hit by a car in front of the school today. \nBut he didn\u2019t. And it made me realize, as I arrived at work this morning and sat in my car crying, that I am most thankful for those moments of grace \u2013 when something horrible could have happened, but it didn\u2019t. That all the times over the years when Nigel wandered off and was lost that I eventually found him, unharmed. That all the times when he was little and a sound upset him and he bolted into the street or a parking lot, he was unharmed. That the boy who was almost hit by the car this morning wasn\u2019t.\nThese are all moments of grace \u2013 \u201cthere for the grace of God go I\u201d \u2013 \u00a0a divine favor, a gift. A break. All the times when I\u2019ve muttered, half to myself, half upward, \u201cCan\u2019t I ever get a break?\u201d \u2013 now I know. These are my breaks. I\u2019ve had them all along. They are all around me, still. And my thankfulness is boundless.\nWishing you and yours a very blessed and Happy Thanksgiving!\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://knowledgeforpeople.org/", "http://www.autismnepal.org/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/11/25/moments-of-grace/", "title": "Moments of Grace"},
{"date": "August 4, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tNigel and Aidan come from a long line of national park enthusiasts. When I was a child, my family combed the western states, visiting nearly every national park from Yosemite to Mt. Rushmore (technically, that\u2019s a national monument, but you get the idea). We went to the Grand Canyon three times. My mother has been a ranger at Lassen in California and is currently a ranger at Crater Lake National Park here in Oregon. For many years she was a tour guide in Yellowstone. I have taken Nigel and Aidan to all of those parks and several others.\n\nAnd so, my sons were looking forward to our recent trip to the Grand Canyon (their first) as much as I was. Along the way, we stopped at Hoover Dam, per Nigel\u2019s request. He insisted on walking half-way across the\u00a0dam so that he could stand on the border of Nevada and Arizona, as you will see in the photo below. It was hideously hot, well into triple digits. We slid into our (mercifully air conditioned) rental car and connected with I-40 all the way to Flagstaff, where the boys were only too happy to leap into the hotel pool. We rose early the next morning to head to the busiest national park at the busiest time of year.\n\nHaving been to the GC before, I knew that the best way to experience it is to get down in it, even just a little. There are two trails along the South Rim that you can take. One, Bright Angel Trail, is more like a thoroughfare. You\u2019ve got tons of people like me who want to hike into the canyon, and you\u2019ve got the mule trains going forth and back. Not ideal conditions for two boys with sensory issues. So I took them on the Kaibab Trail, which is far less crowded and \u2013 according to a website that turned out to be wrong -not used by the mule trains.\nSo we get to the trailhead, strap on our hydration pack, and head out, or down, I should say. Nothing like a good hike to get the blood flowing! We have barely begun, are only fifty feet from the trailhead, and Aidan, with his vestibular hypersensitivity, stops short. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this, Mom,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey,\u201d I assure him. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be near any cliffs.\u201d I put my arm around him and try to gently lead him forward. He does not budge. \u201cI can\u2019t do it, Mom!\u201d We are five feet below the rim, and he is having an attack of acrophobia. This I had not planned for. Nigel is barreling on ahead, and I call out to him to slow down for Aidan. \u201cCan\u2019t I just wait at the trailhead for you?\u201d Aidan asks. I tell him I don\u2019t want him waiting alone for an hour and a half. Then I put him on the inside of the trail, and I explain to him that we will walk together slowly and that I will switch places with him whenever the trail switches direction. He reluctantly complies.\n\nAt every switchback, Aidan complains a bit, but he walks with me, staring down his fear. I tell him how well he\u2019s doing and how proud I am of him as we catch up to Nigel. We are five minutes into the Grand Canyon, and Nigel has the mother of all bloody noses. As he usually does whenever he gets a bloody nose, he has smeared it all over his face. We have been on countless family hikes, Nigel has been hiking with Scouts for almost five years, and he\u2019s never had a bloody nose on a hike. Of course now I don\u2019t have any tissues. Of course. One small stroke of luck is that Nigel is wearing a navy blue shirt, so the blood will not glare as much, and I tell him to use his shirt to wipe his face. The blood is pouring out of his nose, it\u2019s a proverbial faucet, so I sit him down and instruct him to pinch the sides of it. Aidan sits down next to him. I try to wipe more blood with the blue shirt.\nAt this point, people -other hikers \u2013 have started stopping and asking if Nigel\u2019s okay. I mean, it looks like a rock landed on his face. I tell them he\u2019s fine, it\u2019s just a bloody nose. Two different parties of people stop to offer us tissues, and I couldn\u2019t thank them enough. Who goes on a hike and doesn\u2019t bring tissues?! Good grief, you\u2019d think I\u2019d never been on a hike before. So we lost about a half an hour with that. Nigel would get antsy from sitting, say, \u201cI think the bleeding has stopped,\u201d and we would start walking. Seconds later he\u2019d be bleeding again, so we\u2019d stop and sit and blot and pinch. Then we\u2019d get up and keep walking and sit down again when he needed to. Finally the bleeding stopped for good.\nAnd Aidan, acrophobic Aidan, continued on alone up front. I guess he realized that the trail was actually pretty safe, or maybe he just got used to it. I was shocked but knew better than to make a big deal out of it. We met up with him at Oo-Ah Point (yes, it\u2019s called that because of the view), which he quickly surveyed, unimpressed, and then turned around to head back up. I snapped a few photos and headed back with Nigel, pacing ourselves. Aidan must have felt much more confident going up, and he was quickly out of sight.\n\nAidan at Oo-Ah Point\n\nNigel at Oo-Ah Point, with his blood-soaked shirt and tissue-stuffed nostril\nAbout half-way up, we ran into a mule train coming down, maybe eight of them. They were in training, with blocks of wood on their backs. We stepped to the side as they passed, and I hoped that Aidan had managed okay. Soon, we reached the top and found him waiting at the trailhead. I couldn\u2019t wait to praise him again for being so brave in the Canyon, but before I could, he said, \u201cI thought you said there would be no mules on this trail!\u201d I told him that I had been misinformed, and then we headed straight to the lodge for ice cream. Because really, that\u2019s our favorite part about national parks. Bring on the heat, acrophobia, bloody noses, and mule trains. Just don\u2019t forget the ice cream.\n\nAfter ice cream, Nigel meets a new friend\n\nat Wupatki Indian Ruins the next day\n\na centuries-old ball court\n\nBoys and sticks in the desert\n\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/08/04/getting-the-blood-flowing/", "title": "Getting the Blood Flowing"},

The occupant has autism and, although he eventually learned to talk, he is characteristically literal-minded and often has difficulty understanding various figures of speech.

The floor of the bedroom is piled high with dirty clothes, papers, trash, food wrappers, Lego and Bionicle pieces, DVDs, books, and magazines. The boy\u2019s mother, astounded that even with the weekly room-cleaning sessions the mess still builds up so quickly, stands in the doorway with her hands on her hips. She recalls previous attempts and avoidance techniques and congratulates herself that she has at least implemented the mandatory weekly sessions prior to allowance disbursement and movie time. The mess is nowhere near as bad as it used to get, and for that she is relieved. She steps inside the room and gives suggestions for a plan of attack, pointing at the largest pile and urging her son to first put away the clothes, and that will make the pile seem a lot smaller. The son gestures wildly at the pile.\nTeenage son: \u00a0What a load of crap!\nMother (matter-of-factly):\u00a0 Well, if it\u2019s crap, let\u2019s throw it away then.\nTeenage son (aghast):\u00a0 It\u2019s not all crap!

{"date": "August 2, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tAs an autism parent nearly twelve years post diagnosis, I (and, I\u2019m sure, many other parents) have developed what is often referred to as \u201cA-dar,\u201d short for autism radar. It\u2019s the awareness of a possible autism diagnosis through observing the behavior and facial cues of children and adults with whom we happen to come in contact. It\u2019s not something I ever make an effort to do \u2013 it just happens. I\u2019ll be in a public place, or a gathering of some sort, and I happen to notice something different, but all too familiar. My spine sort of tingles, and I know. Or I think I know.\nA week before going to Nepal, I spent a couple of days visiting with my extended family that lives in Los Angeles County, where I grew up. My brother and sister-in-law hosted a barbeque on the Fourth of July, and, in addition to everyone\u2019s company, I enjoyed lounging around their pool and watching the fireworks from it. We could see about a dozen different fireworks shows in the surrounding communities, all going off intermittently. It was really cool to watch, and I was happy to be there.\nThe next day, my brother and I got together with our youngest sister and drove out to Hacienda Heights, a city in LA County where we had spent most of our childhood. We drove by three of the homes we\u2019d lived in, stopping to take photos of two of them. They\u2019d both been redecorated, of course, and we were relieved that they were not in disrepair. One had had a tree in the front yard that my brother and I used to climb regularly, and it had been taken out, we noted with disappointment. \u00a0One had been a brand new home when we moved into it in 1976, and so the baby trees that our parents had planted had grown up all these years later, towering over the house.\u00a0 The fact that we had now grown up, too, was not lost on us.\nThen we went to the local ice cream store where I had worked during high school. It was still there! It felt weird to be buying cones from the other side of the counter, noting all the changes in the place since I\u2019d been gone for twenty years. The chain grocery store that had anchored the shopping center was empty, out of business. But the ice cream store was still there, a little oasis on a hot day. Then we drove out to the mall where we used to buy all our school clothes while growing up, and we stopped for lunch at a Mexican restaurant that we\u2019d loved as kids. This time, though, we had margaritas.\nAfter lunch, we drove out to the cemetery where one of our grandfathers is buried. We couldn\u2019t remember where it was, but we had a hunch and were able to find it. The three of us sat under a tree on a bench next to his grave and talked about our memories of him. My brother noticed a cigarette butt on the grave marker and got up to flick it away. Then we laughed as we realized that Grandpa probably liked having it there, since he was a smoker who always tried to hide it from everyone. \u00a0\nWhen it was time to drive back to my brother\u2019s house, he stopped for gas and got out to pump it. Sitting in the passenger seat, I began to hear some type of vocal stimming coming from the SUV filling up next to us. \u201cKava, kava, kava, kava,\u201d it sounded like. A few seconds went by, then \u201cKava, kava, kava,\u201d again. It was a masculine voice, maybe an older teen. I wanted to see him, wanted to see if my interpretation of what I was hearing was correct. But the windows of the SUV were dark, and I could not see in. After another minute, the SUV pulled away, and I silently wished them well. \u00a0\nSeconds later, I heard it again. \u201cKava, kava, kava.\u201d Obviously, it had not been from an occupant of the SUV. I turned around and looked. \u201cKava, kava, kava.\u201d It was a young man selling flowers. What? I thought. What is he saying? I strained to decipher it and decided that he must be saying \u201cFlowah, flowah, flowah.\u201d But he was saying it so quickly and run-together, with a non-native-English-speaker accent, that I thought I had been hearing vocal stimming. I had been convinced that that\u2019s what it was. I laughed inwardly at myself, my certainty, and my mistake. Sometimes things are not always as they appear to be. Houses are repainted, trees grow bigger or get removed, and sometimes a guy is just selling flowers.\n\nMy brother and I in front of one of our childhood homes\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/08/02/things-are-not-always-as-they-seem/", "title": "Things Are Not Always As They Seem"},
{"date": "November 29, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\u201cDid you refill your pill organizer for next week?\u201d I ask Nigel as he walks into the kitchen.\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d He walks over to the cupboard where we keep his bottles of medication, takes a bottle out, and proceeds to shake it vigorously as he walks to the kitchen table. It sounds like he\u2019s got a maraca in his hand. Then he puts the bottle down, opens it, and begins filling his weekly pill container.\nTwo weeks ago, we saw his psychiatrist and discussed weaning him off of one of his medications \u2013 Zoloft. He had been taking it for almost two years, and had been at the same dosage for over a year, in spite of the fact that he\u2019d grown a lot in that time. The OCD behavior he\u2019d exhibited that made me realize he needed the medication (systematically pulling his hair out and eating it) is no longer present at all, and hasn\u2019t been for a while.\u00a0 The doctor concurred, and told us to halve the remainder of what Zoloft we had, and Nigel would be completely off of it in two weeks. The Risperidone, which he has been on for almost a year, he will continue to take for several more months at least. I figured that it would take him about two years to learn to regulate his behavior himself, which is why he started taking it.\nBefore leaving, we stopped by the front desk to schedule our next appointment two months out, as instructed by the doctor. The scheduler, a friendly but disheveled-looking woman with erratic movements (tics, possibly?), gave a little \u201cYay!\u201d and started looking through her agenda. I recalled her reaction six months previously, when the doctor told us to schedule the next appointment in three months, how the scheduler actually whooted and did a little happy dance. I politely smiled in response, not sure what the celebration was about. Yay, we don\u2019t have to come back for three whole months to a place that Nigel despises? Yay, you don\u2019t have to see us again for three whole months? Or Yay, we\u2019ve reached a positive point with the meds and they don\u2019t need to be tinkered with for a while? I\u2019m guessing it was the latter. But still. My day of celebration will come when he no longer needs the medication at all.\nAnd with the successful departure of Zoloft, we are getting there. The fact is that, even at small doses, the Risperidone is something that needs to be watched. Nigel was required to have blood drawn last week for several routine tests and had to see a specialist to make sure the drug is not affecting his joints, among other things. The fact that he developed a trigger finger on one hand and a sore joint in one foot, both in the past year, disturbs me. I don\u2019t like this stuff. I don\u2019t like pumping his growing body with chemicals.\nI\u2019m certainly not against medication; it is integral to the functioning of those who need it. I have seen how much it helps, and I know that some children truly need it for their conditions. Nigel needed it to stop pulling out his hair and eating it. Then he needed it to help with his behavior regulation, since his autism prevented him from regulating it on his own. But he\u2019s learning how. And, as he says, he learns by doing. Each time he demonstrates appropriate management of his behavior, he learns from it. Yes, for now it\u2019s facilitated by his medication. But as he learns (and as his dosage is not increased with his growth), his behavior regulation is going to become more and more his own doing, not that of the medication.\n\u201cHow much longer do I have to keep taking this?\u201d Nigel asks after he swallows his morning dose. He knew that he needed it a year ago and requested it, but he believes that it makes his scalp itch and wants to stop taking it. \u201cBecause even on days when I forget to take it, I\u2019m still calm at school.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that could be because it\u2019s still in your system. But I also think it\u2019s because you\u2019re learning to regulate your behavior yourself.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I am. I don\u2019t get angry like I used to.\u201d\nI tell him that we\u2019ll talk to his doctor about it at our appointment in January and see what she thinks. And maybe I\u2019ll have my day of celebration sooner than I\u2019d originally thought.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/11/29/the-regulator/", "title": "The Regulator"},

{"date": "September 10, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nI don\u2019t really remember having a hero when I was growing up. Some kids idolize actors, musicians, and athletes. Some kids cite firefighters or other rescue personnel as heroes. Sometimes teachers, even parents. Religious and political figures. And then there are those who have fictional characters as their heroes \u2013 movie, book,\u00a0or cartoon characters and superheroes (I admit, I did have a bizarre crush on Aquaman for a while).\nAs adults, we often develop different heroes (fortunately, for some of us). Our friends and spouses, for example. Our siblings. For many, parents still head the list. Those of us who are special needs parents often list the teachers and therapists who work with our children as our heroes, not to mention our children themselves, with all that they go through. And then we \u2013 parents \u2013 have each other. We inspire, listen, support, encourage, and make suggestions. We reach out, share, learn, and hope. We identify with each other. \u00a0We are each others\u2019 heroes.\nAnd now I have a new hero to add to the list \u2013 the ever-growing list of fellow autism parents I have become fortunate enough to know, either online or in person, or both. I want everyone else to know about him too, because I think he\u2019s phenomenal. I\u2019ll call him Bert. Bert attends the support group that I facilitate. He\u2019s 84 years old and has a son with Asperger\u2019s. Eighty-four! His son is 58, and Bert drives him to work and cares for him. (He recently applied with a local organization that handles adult DD services to get some support systems in place.) Bert reads anything about autism that he can get his hands on, takes notes, and comes to the meetings to tell all of us about what he read. He tells jokes, encourages us to lean on each other (like AA people, he says), and patiently listens to those of us with much younger kids. He reminds us that even though our kids are all different and at different ages, we share many similar experiences. He wears a cute straw hat and plaid shirts and I just want to give him a big hug. All of us inspire each other, but that man, that gentle, devoted, amazing man, is my new hero (sorry, Aquaman).\nBert, I want to be like you when I grow up.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/09/10/bert/", "title": "Bert"},
{"date": "September 20, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tHow many times have you heard \u201cThey grow so fast\u201d? In my almost fifteen years of being a parent, I\u2019ve heard it a lot. I\u2019m sure most of us have. And all the times I heard it I would smile and nod; I wanted to seem wistful, like other parents. But inside I was thinking that it didn\u2019t seem fast to me. \nLooking back, I always wanted to get through my children\u2019s various stages. When they were babies, I couldn\u2019t wait for them to sit up, become mobile. I figured they would be happier when they could do those things. I figured they wouldn\u2019t cry for hours on end. I figured I could get some sleep then. I figured things would be a little easier. Then I couldn\u2019t wait for them to start talking. I figured they wouldn\u2019t get so frustrated. I figured they would stop screaming. Of course, I had to wait many years for that (both the start of the talking and the end of the screaming). \nThen there was all of the \u201cextra\u201d stuff. Two sets of IEP meetings, specialist doctor appointments, tests, and therapy sessions. I wanted to get through all of that, too. I was so busy trying to get through everything I perceived as stressful that I developed tunnel vision. And while tunnel vision is great for finishing college or being apart from loved ones for a long time, it\u2019s not the best way to be a parent \u2013 whether you believe they grow fast or not.\nAnd now my younger son is 13, in middle school. The older one, almost 15, just started high school. I catch myself thinking \u201cif he can make it through this first year, he\u2019ll be okay,\u201d or \u201cas soon as he\u2019s finished with middle school, things will be easier.\u201d But what about the time in between? Why do I still want to get through it? Some of it is still stressful, yes, but not all of it. And sometimes when I least expect it.\nTake, for example, my son\u2019s appointment with his psychiatrist today. I rushed home from work, picked him up, and rushed to the doctor\u2019s office. On the way, I realized that I had forgotten the book I wanted to bring to read in the waiting room. Then I started thinking about what the blazes I would make for dinner, wondering whether the pharmacy would still be open after the appointment, and hoping that the DVDs that were due today were all in the cases that I had tossed on the back seat of the car. We arrived barely on time, signed in, and sat down to fill out the half-page form that must be filled out for all appointments. It requires a few checkmarks and about six written words. I have started having my son do it so that he learns these things. This is the third time I have instructed him to do it, and for the third time, he balks.\u00a0 \u201cWhy do I have to do it?\u201d he demands. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t like writing,\u201d he growls, and then, when he is almost finished, he fumes, \u201cJust because it says \u2018signature\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean it has to be in cursive!\u201d \u201cWhy are you being so argumentative?\u201d I ask, trying not to smirk. \u201cI\u2019m not being argumentative!\u201d he retorts. And then I start to laugh. I try to hide it, try to turn it into a cough, but he calls me on it. \u201cYou did that because you\u2019re laughing,\u201d he says in a low voice. \nAfter assuring him that I\u2019m not laughing at him, I try to explain the concept of stress release, that sometimes I just start laughing when something\u2019s not really that funny. What I feel like telling him, but can\u2019t, is that I realize I\u2019m also laughing in relief. I look at my beautiful, argumentative son and it hits me. He\u2019s talking now. He\u2019s not screaming. He\u2019s not bolting away or writhing on the floor in sensory overload. All this time that I\u2019d been trying to get through all of that, I never realized that I did get through it. Yes, more issues have come up. Different sources of stress. Just because he started talking and stopped screaming doesn\u2019t mean that all of my stress is gone. But that stress is gone. The stress of dealing with a bolting, screaming, nonverbal child is now gone. We didn\u2019t get here by magic, but still, we finally got here. For years I didn\u2019t know if we could. And I am laughing, wondering why I hadn\u2019t stopped to realize it before. \nI need to turn off the tunnel vision, open my eyes, and look around at what\u2019s happening now. I have a few years left with my children before they become adults. And even though at least one of them will still be home with me for an indefinite amount of time, things will not be the same. Even though, to me, they don\u2019t grow fast, they still grow. And I don\u2019t want to miss any of it because I\u2019m too busy trying to get through it.\u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/09/20/with-my-eyes-open/", "title": "With My Eyes Open"},

{"date": "September 22, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nMy friends are my estate.\u00a0 \u2013 Emily Dickinson\n\nWhere would we be without our friends? I know that I would certainly be in a far less positive state of mind without mine, at any point in my life. Everything \u2013 from walking to school in fourth grade to attending high school dances to needing someone to help me move or crying about my divorce \u2013 would have been so much harder without them. Nor would the enjoyable things have been as much fun. Upon my return from our recent mini-trip, I realized that forging that connection was the point of the entire weekend.\nWe started off by visiting Aidan\u2019s best friend since first grade. He had moved out of our area in the spring and now lives on the central coast, almost four hours away. We drove to their home on Friday night, and the boys had a great time playing video games and goofing off. I enjoyed seeing his friend\u2019s mom, with whom I have also become friends. I love the fact that among the many benefits of having children are the new friends we meet because of them. I probably would never have met her if Aidan hadn\u2019t become friends with her son, and I enjoy her company and talking about our lives while our kids get to roll down huge sand dunes and make up for lost time. It doesn\u2019t surprise me to note the similarities between the parents of my children\u2019s friends and me.\nThe next morning, Nigel and I left Aidan\u00a0at his friend\u2019s house\u00a0and continued up the gorgeous coast. We met up with Pixie and her husband at the Oregon Coast Aquarium and enjoyed looking at all the marine exhibits, including the shark tunnel. Nigel communicated with a sea otter. The Pixie parents found souvenirs that were perfect for each of their children back home. Then we caravanned up to the house that they had rented in Rockaway Beach, gorged ourselves on savory Mexican food for dinner, built a bonfire on the beach, hot-tubbed, and talked until we nearly passed out. Pixie and her husband are yet another example of friends I have met because of my children. If Nigel had not had autism, I would not have started blogging (at least not about autism), and then I would have missed a friendship with two amazing people who know what it\u2019s like to have to fight for your children, who experience the same emotions and triumphs and fears, and who share many of the same priorities and dreams. They are warm, witty, and genuine, and I am so happy to have spent time with them. They may live far away, and they may be among the newest of my friends, but I value my connection with them immensely.\nSunday morning, Nigel and I drove a little further up the coast and had brunch with a friend I\u2019ve had for 28 years. We went to elementary and junior high school together in southern California, and we\u2019ve kept in touch through high school, college, and beyond. Though in some ways our lives are different, I think it\u2019s no small coincidence that we both ended up making Oregon our home (even though at\u00a0opposite ends of the state)! We shared a lovely brunch of homemade popovers with homemade peach jam, talked about our families, looked at the photo album of my Nepal trip, and commented that we need to find a way to see each other more often!\nAfter that, Nigel and I made our way back down the coast and picked up Aidan, and then we jogged back to the middle of the state to stop in and see my sister and brother-in-law and my five-month-old nephew. He is the smiliest, cutest little bug ever! My brother and sister-in-law also happened to be visiting that day, up from LA. It was such a wonderful, impromptu little reunion! We took turns holding the newest member of the family, feasted on a lovely pasta dish with homemade pesto, and sampled my sister\u2019s homebrewed beer. We laughed and reminisced. We communed. All of us enjoy each other\u2019s company so much. I realized that my siblings \u2013 and their spouses \u2013 are not only family, they are among my cherished friends. \u00a0\nAnd so I wonder again, where would I be without them in my life? Where would any of us be? As Emily put it, my friends are my estate. And there is so much room in the human heart. More than we could ever imagine.\n\nwith Pixie at Cannon Beach \u2013 photography by Nigel!\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://imapixiemama.blogspot.com/", "http://www.aquarium.org/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/09/22/my-estate/", "title": "My Estate"},
{"date": "September 15, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nMost of you know that I am a single parent. From mid-June to mid-August, my sons visit their father 700 miles away, and I get a much-needed break. I get some extra work done, take trips, and get a little time to myself \u2013 and time to miss my boys like crazy. Two months is too long of a break if you ask me, but we\u2019ve been doing this for nearly eight years, so we deal with it.\nBut those ten months \u2013 from mid-August to mid-June \u2013 are all me. I am a full-time SP of two. Some days it feels impossible to fit it all in. Some weeks are so full that I feel like I just can\u2019t do it anymore. I finally reach Friday night and collapse on the couch with a glass of wine and stare at the TV because I can\u2019t even think straight. And so, I\u2019ve written a bit about single parenting, including my 5 tips for single parenting with autism. When I think of that post it makes me laugh (hysterically) because it\u2019s so difficult for me to do the things I am suggesting that other people do! Not practicing what I preach in that regard, that\u2019s for sure. I never applied for respite. Ever. Missed that boat. My life feels so disorganized. I don\u2019t have time to exercise. Sometimes I fear that I\u2019m a walking \u201cbefore\u201d photo of a nervous breakdown.\nSo it doesn\u2019t surprise me that last week, after trying to cram a bunch of errands in one fell swoop, I forgot the toilet paper. Not just as in \u201cI went to the store and forgot to buy toilet paper,\u201d but as in \u201cI bought toilet paper at the store and forgot to bring it home.\u201d And it took me eight days to remember that I forgot it. I was going through my wallet full of receipts at the end of the week and saw it on the receipt \u2013 a 12-pack of Scott\u2019s 1000-sheet rolls. I get that kind because it lasts longer, so I have to buy toilet paper less often. So infrequently, in fact, that when I do buy it I just leave it on the bottom rack of the cart in the parking lot. And then I drive away. And I don\u2019t remember that I left it in the parking lot until eight days later when I see it on the receipt and realize that I don\u2019t remember bringing the large package into the house. No recollection whatsoever. Here I am, in the store, so proud of myself for thinking ahead because I don\u2019t need toilet paper yet, we\u2019re only half-way through the current 12-pack, but it\u2019s on sale for a fantastic price, like, half what I usually pay, so I put it on the bottom rack. I am careful to mention it to the checker so that he rings it up and I pay for it, but then I promptly forget about it.\nOh, eff me, I mutter at the receipt. It\u2019s not like it was a huge financial loss, but I just think, really? I try to get ahead of the game and this is where it gets me. I briefly consider calling the grocery store to explain what happened, to ask if maybe one of their courtesy clerks remembered seeing an abandoned multi-pack of toilet paper when corralling the carts. Eight days ago. I dismiss it \u2013 like I have time to do that in the first place. Chalk it up to loss \u2013 one 12-pack of Scott and my semblance of sanity. I\u2019ve had to let go of worse.\nBut my subconscious, it would seem, will not let it go. Unbeknownst to me, my subconscious ruminates for a few more days. It thinks, Yes, she\u2019s got a lot on her mind, a lot on her plate, but this isn\u2019t the worst shape she\u2019s ever been in. Surely she didn\u2019t leave the toilet paper on the bottom rack of the cart in the parking lot. My subconscious works on this for three days, apparently, and then all of a sudden, while sitting in front of my computer and not thinking about the toilet paper, something pops into my head. A flash of memory:\u00a0 I am putting the toilet paper on top of the vacuum cleaner because there is no room on the shelf where I usually store it. I gasp and run down the hallway to the closet where I keep the vacuum cleaner. I rip open the door and there is the Scott 12-pack, sitting on top of the vacuum cleaner. And I laugh.\nI laugh because I realize, once again, that it\u2019s not as bad as it seems. I may not be exercising yet (must get back into yoga), and I sure need to organize my time better (life coach, maybe?), but I think I\u2019ve got a handle on things. If I can remember something as insignificant as the toilet paper I thought I forgot, I\u2019m doing all right. Right? I can do this. I can do this with my eyes closed, it would seem. Some days, at least.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/09/15/with-my-eyes-closed/", "title": "With My Eyes Closed"},
{"date": "December 2, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tEd. note: Apologies for the cryptic nature of this post. And thanks for reading it anyway.\nThere are times when I think it would have been advantageous to have made this an anonymous blog. Times when I wish I could tap into the cathartic quality of blogging, write about what happens, what I struggle with as a parent. But sometimes I can\u2019t. And this is one of those times.\nIt was discovered this morning that one of my sons committed an infraction against my other son, sight unseen. It was the type of thing to which some people would just say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s what siblings do,\u201d but that\u2019s not what I say. It was the type of thing where the guilty party could blame it on certain organizational deficits instead of admitting fault. It was the type of thing that, if not stopped now, could easily grow into a problem that would later involve others besides his sibling. And it\u2019s the type of thing that I will not specify because I don\u2019t want to violate his privacy.\nOf course, the morning rush is not the time to handle such infractions. Not only that, I needed a plan. What I wish I had was someone to bounce strategies off of, someone to whom I could say, \u201cHow do you think we should handle this?\u201d That would entail there being a \u201cwe\u201d involved, and since there is not, I somehow got though a busy day at work while bouncing ideas off of myself. \u00a0I allowed myself a quick moment of self-pity while checking my e-mail. And then I got my answer \u2013 at least part of it. It was the day\u2019s post from Daily OM, and it was exactly what I needed. It was a way for me to start off by telling my son that even if something he does seems insignificant, it\u2019s not. \u201cEverything You Do Matters,\u201d the title said, and the post described how our actions, both positive and negative, cause a ripple effect that spreads to many more people than we can ever realize. I printed it out to read to my son when we got home, and I spent the rest of the day coming up with ways to expand on it.\nAt home, the plan, which I had gone over in my head all day long, backfired. My son was defensive and vehemently denied doing what he\u2019d been accused of, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, even though I\u2019d approached the subject in a calm, diplomatic manner. I was not pleased. It was bad enough that he had done it, but then to deny it? Not cool. However, in a moment of what could only have been divine inspiration, I told him that we would be spending the next few days doing a certain thing that would either disprove his alibi or vindicate him. (I did not use those words while speaking to him, of course; I reserve all the fancy wording for the blog.) But what I said next was \u2013 I think \u2013 what made all the difference. I told him, sincerely, that if it turned out that he did not do what he\u2019d been accused of, I would be the first to apologize for not trusting him. And then I left the room.\nI sat at my computer, logging back in to do more work. I tried not to fume. I tried to let it go. The confrontation was over; I had done my parental best. But what if this was the beginning of a terrible habit? What if, in not wanting to be a Gestapo parent, I hadn\u2019t done enough to stop it? Parental guilt gets me either way. I sat there in its grip, unable to reason, unable to see past the moment.\nFifteen minutes later, my son walked into my office. He sat on the floor for a few minutes, petting the cats and sighing audibly. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d I asked, still going for diplomacy. And then, I heard the magic words. \u201cI have something to tell you. I\u2019m just afraid you\u2019ll be mad at me.\u201d\nRelief washed over me as I realized that maybe, just maybe, I\u2019m getting through to him. We talked, and it was good. We talked about what it means to have integrity. We talked about doing the right thing. We both shed a few tears. Later, he apologized to his brother, and although I didn\u2019t hear the exchange, I was told separately by both parties that it was positive. You know that saying about parenting being the toughest job you\u2019ll ever love? Every day is a testament to how true that is. And if your wording is vague enough, you can blog about it anyway.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dailyom.com/", "http://www.dailyom.com/articles/2009/21194.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/12/02/vague-catharsis/", "title": "Vague Catharsis"},
{"date": "September 24, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nI\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all done it at some point. We look through the photo albums, gaze at the images of our little ones and sit there, transfixed, in memory. We wonder \u2013 that thing he\u2019s doing with clenching his fists \u2013 did that somehow point to autism? How he used to put his head back and say \u2018aaahhh\u2019 repetitively? The way he did the \u20185-point crawl,\u2019 with his forehead on the floor? We just thought it was cute at the time, endearing. But he laughed! He smiled! \nOf course he did, I remind myself. He still does. He was a happy kid then and he\u2019s still, for the most part, a happy kid. School, high school, so far seems to be going well. Well in the sense that he\u2019s getting where he\u2019s supposed to be safely and on time, he\u2019s not causing behavioral disturbances (to my knowledge), he\u2019s not being bullied, and his new case manager is already working to meet his individual needs. Alas, his needs \u2013 that\u2019s where the issues have come up. \u00a0\nWhen we had our meeting in the spring, and Nigel made that comment about H.G. Wells and Jules Verne books, the special education coordinator had asked if weekly check-in meetings with him \u201cwould be fine.\u201d She seemed to believe that because he is intelligent enough to read those books, he has fewer needs. I diplomatically explained that Nigel would need daily check-in meetings, that one of his areas of deficit is executive function. Last week, at the end of the first two weeks of school, his case manager emailed to gently suggest that she sensed that Nigel might need two daily check-in meetings, as well as aides in all classes. Oh, blessed email! Blessed case manager! I wanted to hug her through the Internet ether, even though it pained me to admit, readily, that she was right. He needs even more assistance than I had thought he would.\nAt his IEP meeting the next day, which Nigel attended, things went perfectly. I think it was one of the best IEP meetings ever. Nigel presented himself exactly how he needed to \u2013 instinctively, it would seem. There are times when he lets his best efforts propel him through a situation, but this was not necessarily one of those times. He answered questions, but he allowed himself to be himself \u2013 he spoke in his low, halting voice, with a lot of pauses and \u2018eh\u2019 and \u2018hmm\u2019 between words. He took extra time before answering, and he did not make eye contact. I know that at this point in his life, Nigel has the ability to communicate \u2018better\u2019 than this when he is motivated to. But the way that he communicated at that meeting was exactly how he needed to in order to communicate his needs. To show them that even though he is now \u2018high-functioning,\u2019 he has needs that must be met in order for him to function as well as he can.\nAnd this school, which is in the same district as the terrible middle school that did not meet his needs, this school is going to meet his needs. They have already rearranged his schedule so that he can have two study periods a day with his case manager (love her). Not only that, they still allowed him to keep his electives and the same teachers for his academic classes, minimizing how much change he has to assimilate. In addition to this impressive scheduling feat, they have also assigned him full-time aides in all of his academic classes and a student aide in his electives. The really amazing thing is that I didn\u2019t even have to ask for the aides.\nIt is somehow hard for me to go from not having any of Nigel\u2019s educational needs met and fighting \u00a0\u2013 to having most of his needs met and not having to fight. I just can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m stunned. I mean, of course I\u2019m relieved and happy, but I don\u2019t feel secure in it yet, which is sad. After being on the defensive for so long, it\u2019s hard to let it go.\nAnd it\u2019s equally hard to let go of the questioning that goes along with the old family photo albums. The searching for signs, the wondering why, and how. The pain of seeing the birthdays without words. It\u2019s all part of the experience of parenting a child with autism. But after a while, as I leafed through the albums, I noted that many of the pages were tattered, little rips here and there, some smudges. At first I was disappointed, but then I realized that those perceived defects were signs of enjoyment and appreciation. Our photo albums have been looked through a lot, and not just by me. My sons look at the photos and see the smiles, the good times, the birthday presents, the people who love them. They don\u2019t dwell on their development or anyone\u2019s diagnosis. They just enjoy the pictures, and, I hope, their memories.\nI need to learn how to do that. And I also need to let go of the defensive parenting and not be skeptical of the long-awaited and hard-won positive educational setting. Oh, blessed school! My son has greater needs than we thought, but those needs are being acknowledged and met, and I don\u2019t have to fight!

{"date": "December 3, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nSo you know how when you blog about how well your child has been doing lately, very soon after that something happens just to keep you in check? Just to tell you don\u2019t-be-counting-your-chickens and such? Yeah, that\u2019s what happens. Apparently I forgot to knock on some wood (does my particle-board desk count?) when I wrote a few days ago about Nigel possibly discontinuing Risperidone sooner than I\u2019d thought. About him learning to regulate his behavior on his own. Yeah, about that.\nFirst, a\u00a0disclaimer: Nigel has a really full plate right now (sort of like the one who gave birth to him). He\u2019s enrolled in a full day of classes, in a transitional year (adjusting to a new school as well as a new level of school). And although he\u2019s not experiencing the bullying of middle school (a huge relief), he is experiencing some stress in keeping up with assignments. Add to that the time spent in wrestling practice (Monday through Friday, right after school until 6:00 PM), and he doesn\u2019t have much down time, which he sorely needs. He needs to have his time to watch movies, build Lego, and read. But he also loves wrestling and doesn\u2019t want to give it up.\nAny given day of the week is full. But Tuesdays are too much even for me. On Tuesday, he has school all day, then wrestling practice. I pick him up around six, we rush home, wolf down our dinner, he throws on his uniform, and we run out the door to his Boy Scout meeting. Boy Scouts is another thing that he loves and has been doing for several years. I sit off on the sidelines with some of the other parents while he participates in the meeting. Afterward, we go home, he showers, brushes his teeth, and has a little time to read before bed. It\u2019s a long day for any kid, and especially for an autistic one.\nBut this week, this Tuesday, was like nothing I\u2019d seen in a long time. Someone gave him a stick of gum when we arrived at the Scout meeting, and it was all downhill from there. His behavior was through the roof. No screaming (fortunately he seems to be well past that), but he was all over the place. Running around, acting like a little kid at a playground, disrupting others, bouncing off walls. It was like he had ADHD and was in a manic episode at the same time (for four years, I lived with someone who had ADHD and bipolar disorder, so I have some experience with this combo). I tried to discreetly redirect him, calm him down, but he exploded at me in response, making a scene. I kept watching the clock until the meeting was over. (In the past, I\u2019d tried giving him his evening dose of Risperidone before the meeting, but then he literally had his head on the table the entire meeting and was falling asleep.)\nAs soon as we got home, I went directly to his pill organizer to get out his evening dose for him. It was then that I discovered that he had not even taken his morning dose. And I was relieved. I was so relieved to have an explanation for his behavior, having spent the entire meeting wondering what the hell was going on with him. Any other day of the week, a missed morning dose would have gone unnoticed. I know this because I don\u2019t get any calls from the high school as I did regularly when he was at the middle school. And it was the same with this particular Tuesday \u2013 no calls regarding any behavioral disturbances. Amazing. He missed his morning medication and went through a full day of classes, a two-and-a-half-hour wrestling practice, and a rushed dinner without a single issue. That, my friends, is rather impressive.\nBut that last push with the evening Scout meeting was just too much for him. So, now I have my answer. He does still need the Risperidone, especially on Tuesdays. But he really is learning to regulate his behavior at school, which had previously been a big concern. All things considered, he\u2019s doing pretty well with his full schedule. Even better than the one who gave birth to him.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/12/03/counting-my-chickens/", "title": "Counting My Chickens"},
{"date": "February 7, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tSo I took a big chance at the high school dance . . . \u2013 Aerosmith\nI remember what I wore to my first high school dance as a freshman: a pleated linen skirt, a black shaker-knit sweater (remember those?), and black high heels. I loved that outfit. I loved being at school at night, how different everything looked, how different I felt. A little nervous, but excited.\nFor the past two weeks, Nigel has talked of his desire to attend his school\u2019s winter formal. I\u2019d pick him up from school, and he\u2019d tell me about what they discussed in his social skills class, specifically how to ask a girl to a dance. I remembered the formal dances at my high school and voiced the concern to Nigel that freshmen might not be allowed to attend. I mentioned that we might need to get him a tie. I posed the idea that they might be required to have dates at formal dances. Nigel decided to find out.\nApparently, times have changed. Freshmen can attend, they don\u2019t need to wear a tie, and they\u2019re not required to have a date. So why, then, is it called a formal? Regardless, Nigel was determined to go, and my nerves kicked into overdrive. What if the girls were insincere? What if they asked him to dance only to laugh at him? What if the guys tried to get him to do something that could get him in trouble? What if they talked him into going out to the parking lot or leaving? What if the music was too loud for him, or he got into a situation that he couldn\u2019t handle? The worry was driving me insane, but I had to let him do this.\nThe night of the dance, Nigel watched movies in his room until it was time to get ready. Then he took a shower, brushed his teeth, and put on a ticking-striped button-up shirt, khakis, and a pair of old-school blue Vans with laces. \u201cBecause they\u2019re stylish,\u201d he told me. He came out to the living room and said that he was a little nervous, so he had watched some Winnie-the-Pooh movies to help calm himself. My heart felt like it was caught between my ribs \u2013 Winnie-the-Pooh at age 15. My sweet, innocent boy. And he\u2019s flying solo \u2013 no aide \u2013 at a high school dance. Last year, he attended a middle school dance/event successfully without an aide, but there were other activities, such as an obstacle course and video games, that he could participate in. This would be a whole different ballgame.\nI motioned for him to sit next to me on the couch, and he did. I told him that if the music was too loud for him, or if he felt uncomfortable for any reason, he could call me on his cell phone to come pick him up. It didn\u2019t matter if he had only been there ten minutes. I told him that if anyone was being insincere while dancing with him, he could just say, \u201cNo thanks\u201d and walk away. I told him that if anyone tried to get him to do anything or leave the dance that he could just say, \u201cNo thanks, I\u2019ll just hang out here.\u201d At this stage of his development, our social stories are usually verbal. I rarely have to write it down for him. As liberating for me as this is, it still does not alleviate my worry. I know how vulnerable he is.\u00a0\nHe said that he understood everything I had told him and said that he thought he\u2019d be okay. A larger part of me actually agreed. Then he said, \u201cBut I think it\u2019s too dark to ride my bike.\u201d\n\u201cOh, honey! Of course I\u2019m going to drive you!\u201d Poor boy thought he would have to ride his bike to the dance!\nI dropped him off, came home, and watched a movie with Aidan, thankful for the opportunity to have some one-on-one time with him. Nigel didn\u2019t call, and I hoped all was well. I told him that I would pick him up ten minutes early to avoid the congestion, and when the time came, he was right there waiting, by himself, doing some sort of spinning dance. He got in the car, and before he had even closed the door, he announced, \u201cWell, I danced with a lot of girls!\u201d\nHe assured me that they were nice, they were sincere, and that he felt comfortable and had fun. I told him how glad I was to hear that. On the surface, I felt what I always feel after he does something successfully on his own \u2013 relief and gratitude. But there\u2019s something else there, in my heart, some emotion that I cannot identify, even though I feel it every day of my life, and it makes me want to cry when I\u2019m happy. Maybe it\u2019s just love. The love of a special-needs parent.\n\u201cThis will be a fun high school memory for me,\u201d Nigel said as we got home and walked in the front door. I hugged him and felt that love surge through me again, immense and consuming.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/02/07/the-high-school-dance/", "title": "The High School Dance"},

When you have more than one child, and especially when you have less than two parents, things tend to get very lopsided. I still haven\u2019t figured out how to fix that. \u201cYou always pay more attention to him than me.\u201d\nGuilty as charged.\nEven when I had two kids with IEPs, one\u2019s needs were more demanding than the other\u2019s. One child needed home visits as part of his EI plan; the other did not. One child needed constant supervision; the other did not. One child needed to be homeschooled; the other did not. The list goes on. And you can\u2019t expect the child with fewer needs to be understanding. After all, that child is just as much your child as the one with greater needs.\nSo you try to do special things for and with the child who feels like he\u2019s not as important. You tell him that he is just as important as the one who requires so much more of your time and attention. You write posts about him on your blog and let him read them. And speaking of the blog, whenever you\u2019re working on it in your office and he comes in for some reason, you always minimize the screen out of sensitivity for his feelings, so that it doesn\u2019t seem to him that you\u2019re always writing about his brother. Even though over 90% of the time, you are.\nAnd when he comes into the kitchen the night that you are taking a picture of the photo album, open to a spread of his brother as a baby, and he asks what you\u2019re doing and you tell him that you\u2019re working on an idea for a blog post, it doesn\u2019t surprise you that he just says \u201cOh\u201d in an unimpressed, disappointed tone and walks out.\nAnd it reminds you of how damn lopsided it\u2019s always been, and that for every post you write about his brother, you want to write one about how proud you are of him, the one with fewer needs. And not because he has fewer needs, of course, but because he is so very important to you, and you\u2019re so sorry that it doesn\u2019t always appear that way. And you want to tell him that you look at his baby pictures just as much, and that they are just as meaningful to you, just as beautiful.

I learn so much from all of you, and you enrich my life immeasurably (I think I wrote about that recently). That said, I would like to nominate five blogs in particular that come to mind for this award.\nFirst, to Tera at This Is My Reality. I\u2019ve been reading her blog for quite some time, and she has such an enjoyable writing style that draws you in with her gracious words and insightful observations. She writes about her life in Belgium with her husband and two sons, one of whom is a teen with autism. Tera so eloquently and honestly shares her joys and fears, the ups and downs, and doing the best she can with all of it.\nAlso, to Nicki of Slow Down, Gym Shoe! Nicki is an exceptional writer (her fiction is incredible) and a caregiver for her nieces and nephew. She is currently doing an amazing Totschool program with the kids and is starting her own preschool. She also writes about special needs issues and inspires me with her positive outlook, no matter what\u2019s going on in her life.\nThe next three are some blogs that I only recently started reading, but when awards like this go around, I usually like to highlight blogs that are new to me.

At the time, I had snowboarded off and on for fifteen seasons, and they had skied for at least that long, if not longer. We all felt comfortable at our intermediate-to-advanced skill levels. As I recall, my sister had started doing some small jumps the previous season, and she wanted to practice a bit that day. I thought, Wow, I\u2019ve been snowboarding a long time and I\u2019ve never tried jumping. \u201cI think I\u2019ll try, too,\u201d I said. I followed my younger sister down a few side runs and did some practice ollies, catching a little air off some bumps and landing solidly. It felt so exhilarating! There didn\u2019t seem to be anything to it. \u00a0\nThen we decided to try the real jump in the terrain park. We stood about a hundred feet behind the ramp, watching the person before us approach, jump, and land. It looked easy enough. It looked fun. I was game. My brother-in-law went next, executing a smooth take-off and solid landing. Macrina readied herself, and then she gave me her little tip about needing to go faster than I felt comfortable with. She took the jump the same as her husband, and then waited off to the side with him.\nI can do this, I thought. I jumped out of an airplane and landed that jump just fine, so I can do this one.\u00a0\nI readied myself and took off, keeping my eye on the ramp. I was certainly going faster than I felt comfortable with. In fact, as I quickly approached the base of the ramp, I realized that I was going faster than anyone would feel comfortable with. I suddenly knew that there was no way I could land this jump. That if I tried to land it, I would probably end up breaking both of my wrists, and do some severe ankle and knee damage while I was at it. In that instant, I remembered that people in accidents usually fare better if they relax their bodies rather than tensing up. I knew that my entire body would be ultra tense if I tried to land the jump. So, I made a split-second decision to pass out. As I hit the ramp and literally launched myself into the air, I willed myself to lose consciousness \u2013 right at that second. And that\u2019s all I remember of the jump.\nMy sister and brother in law later told me that I even looked unconscious as I flew horizontally with my board in front of me, about ten feet up and forty feet across. I landed on my right shoulder, but I didn\u2019t feel it. Thank God I was wearing my helmet, because I\u2019m sure my head hit the ground just as hard. The first thing I remember as I was coming to was my brother-in-law leaning over me saying, \u201cDid you get the wind knocked out of you?\u201d I opened my eyes then, not remembering the jump and wondering what I was doing lying on my back in the snow. Moments later, as the Ski Patrol arrived, it started coming back to me. They asked me my name and my age, and I said 34. Then, either Macrina corrected me or I corrected myself, and we laughed that I had forgotten my age.\nI ended up being snowmobiled out on a stretcher, as the Ski Patrol, who called a week later to check on me, were certain that I had broken my collar bone. I could not move my right arm at all. My sister and brother in law loaded me into the car and drove to the hospital for x-rays. My shoulder and chest were purple, and they would turn blue, green, and yellow as the weeks went on. I would later learn that my shoulder was separated in two places, but I did not break my collar bone. I was bruised and sprained in several areas and would need three months of physical therapy, but I did not break a single bone in my body.\nFor the first two weeks I was in constant pain and on Vicodin, but not enough to really dull the pain because I still had to drive and work, take care of kids, and pilot this life of mine. That\u2019s what I feel like sometimes. Like I own an airline and not only am I the pilot but also the flight attendant, mechanic, customer service, ground crew, and the engineer.\u00a0With my right arm in a sling, Nigel learned to scrape ice off the windshield in the mornings, Aidan learned how to work the microwave, and I\u00a0learned to do a lot with my left arm. We managed. The bruising on my right shoulder and other areas of my body was like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. Because I was going so fast, I think that it must have been a bit like being thrown from a vehicle, except I had a helmet on. So even though I did something stupid, something I had no business doing, at least I was wearing my helmet. I cried the first night, alone in my bed, in pain, angry at myself, not wanting to think about how bad it would have been if, instead of my shoulder, I had landed six inches to my left, on my neck. The helmet would not have helped.\nSo, after three months of physical therapy and three years of not being able to sleep on my right side, my shoulder has healed. I even went snowboarding again the next season! But I avoided the jumps, happy to just cruise around and carve my way down. Fortunately, my birthdays since have been much less eventful. And forgetting my age? That probably wasn\u2019t the last time. In fact, I\u2019m sure there will be plenty more opportunities for that in the future. But today, I\u2019m definitely 39. 39 and feelin\u2019 fine.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/02/03/a-birthday-story/", "title": "A Birthday Story"},
{"date": "February 11, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nIt used to be, up until less than two years ago, that my favorite time of day was in the evening, when the boys went to bed, and I had an hour or two before my own bedtime. The day was over, and I had a sliver of time to myself to read, meditate, write (if I had the energy), or watch a movie. And it wasn\u2019t just the time to myself that I loved, it was the security in knowing that my children were safe and (usually) well, and that we had made it through another day. All was right in my little corner of the world.\nI still love the evenings and the sense of peace and comfort that they bring. But my favorite time of day has changed. It\u2019s now 3:40 PM. That\u2019s my new serenity time.\nI get off work at 3:00 and head home, stopping to pick up the mail at our local post office, since I am among many in our small town who do not have mail delivery to our homes. I am usually home around 3:20, alone except for the cats, who rub against my leg\u00a0to welcome me (or, as I\u2019ve read, to mark territory, but affectionately so). I set my things down and go put on my slippers as part of my little transitional routine. Then I sort and read the mail until 3:30, when Aidan arrives. He comes through the front door, calls out \u201cHi, Mom,\u201d and I go over to give him a hug and breathe in the scent at the top of his head. Home. One down, one to go.\nUsually within ten minutes, by 3:40, Nigel comes through the back door, after he has put his bike away in the shed. \u00a0As soon as I hear that door open and shut, I breathe a sigh of relief. The route is less than two miles, but any number of things could go wrong. Once, a few months ago, he had been delayed due to bike problems and called me on his cell to ask me to come and get him. And so, when he wasn\u2019t home by 3:50 one day last week, I thought at first that perhaps it was because of bike trouble again. I waited for the phone to ring, but it didn\u2019t. When the clock struck four, I was out the door. I instructed Aidan to man the phone and to call me on my cell if Nigel called or came home.\nI drove his usual route, checking down side streets to see if he had stopped to talk to someone or pet a cat. Then, about a third of the way, I saw him riding toward me (thank God), and I pulled over. He came up to me, breathless, and launched into a monologue about how he\u2019d stayed after school to talk to his new drama teacher about a play that he wanted to write and produce based on Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. He had that dazed, New Obsession look in his eye, and I groaned inwardly. In his present state, he could not fathom that I had been worried, that he should have called. Midway through his prop ideas, I gently cut him off, saying that we needed to get home and he could finish telling me there. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and started off. \u201cBut take your time! We\u2019re not racing!\u201d I yelled out quickly.\nWe got home, and as I climbed out of the car, he rode up and started in again about the play, right there in the driveway. \u201cPut your bike away, and let\u2019s go inside to talk about it,\u201d I said gently, but business-like. And he did.\nI got in the house, still feeling the uncomfortable effects of the adrenaline, and called out to Aidan that Nigel was back. I collapsed on the couch, and he came inside a moment later. I stood in front of him and put my arms around his unbending frame before he could start talking. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re home safe,\u201d I said. \u201cI was worried because you were late, and you didn\u2019t call to let me know.\u201d\nHe got it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said sincerely. It was one of the rare times he\u2019d said \u201cI\u2019m\u201d in front of \u201csorry.\u201d He said that he got so excited with talking to his teacher about his ideas for the play that he didn\u2019t think to call. Of course, I\u2019d figured that\u2019s what had happened the moment I first saw his face, lost in\u00a0a new obsession. I know that look.\nHe drank some water then, and sat on the couch to finish telling me his ideas. After a few minutes, he got up and announced that he was going to his room to start writing the script. I sat there on my couch that I love, listening to the sounds of my boys happily preoccupied in their rooms. Home. My favorite time of day might have come a little later that day, but there it was. I sat and breathed deeply, enjoying my moment of peace, security, and serenity.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2009/10/20/a-drop-in-the-bucket.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/02/11/coming-home/", "title": "Coming Home"},

He had been diagnosed at age three with classic autism, and again at age five, because he was still not functionally verbal. Through many years of intensive therapy, he learned to talk and filter his sensory issues so that he could be mainstreamed in public school with full-time assistance. That full-time assistance was dropped in middle school, and horrible problems arose. I began seeing regressive behavior that I hadn\u2019t seen in years, in addition to new difficulties that I had no idea how to handle. I turned to the Internet and searched for information on autism in the teen years. I didn\u2019t find much, and I figured that there had to be other parents out there whose children, like mine, had been diagnosed in the early years of the autism \u201cboom.\u201d Those other parents of teens had to also be searching for information, and I wanted to provide a much-needed resource for all of us. I wanted to connect with them \u2013 with any parents of children with autism \u2013 and end my years of isolation. And so, Teen Autism was born.\u00a0 \nInitially, I didn\u2019t plan for it to be a blog. It was to be a website, so I researched how to create a website. Not knowing code, this undertaking was hugely insane. I bought books, purchased a domain, and discovered through my host that I could use the blogging software called WordPress as a content management system (CMS). This sounded like it would work for what I was trying to achieve. I had to learn some code in order to install the software and get it doing what I needed it to do, and I was pretty proud of myself for figuring it out (after hours of head-banging agony). And then I started writing. I wrote on all of the topics that concerned me as the parent of a child with autism, and I categorized the posts on the sidebar so that other parents could scroll down, click on a category that they wanted to read about (sensory issues, bullying, language, siblings, homeschooling and many more), and all of the posts within that category would come up. I wrote and posted five days a week, trying to build up the categories with information for other parents to read. But I wasn\u2019t really blogging yet.\nOccasionally, friends or family would comment on one of my posts, and that was gratifying. My page views per day were increasing, and I received my first encouraging email from another parent of a teen on the spectrum, thanking me for writing. But it wasn\u2019t until about four months later that I really started blogging, i.e. reading others\u2019 blog posts and commenting on them. First Casdok found me and left a comment, and then Mama Edge, who had just started blogging and found me by searching \u201cteen autism,\u201d just as I\u2019d hoped parents would. She left a comment on my post \u201cTo Catch a Fly,\u201d and I went to her first blog, saw her blogroll listing many other parents of kids with autism, and I started blogging. It\u2019s strange to say that I started blogging after I\u2019d already written 105 posts, but that\u2019s how it happened. \nI listed my blog on Technorati and the Ringsurf page for autism bloggers, but other than that, I didn\u2019t do anything to market it. I started building up my own blogroll and realized that I was reading so many blogs that I needed to set up a reader, which I did at Bloglines. My feeds have changed a bit over the last year and half, but I am currently reading 72 blogs, and the majority of them are autism-related. For now, that\u2019s my focus. I intend to keep posting on Teen Autism until Nigel, now 15, transitions out of high school, and I\u2019ll write about that experience for a few months. Afterward, my focus will probably shift to blogs about writing, which I wish I had time to read now. Almost a year ago, Nigel went back to regular school part-time (with assistance), and I resumed working full-time, so I had to reduce my posts per week. As a single parent of two boys whose father lives 700 miles away, I don\u2019t have much free time. But the connections I\u2019ve made through blogging are so important to me that when I do have free time, usually in the late evenings, I blog. It\u2019s a lifeline for me.\nBut even lifelines have to be scheduled.\u00a0I\u2019ve been asked\u00a0how I manage to blog, comment, work, advocate for my son, advocate for others (through volunteer work that I do as a chapter rep for the Autism Society of Oregon), and be a single parent. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure how I fit it all in. Some days are very hard for me to keep it together. But there are three things I do that help me immensely. First, everything is scheduled, even showers. Of course, things always come up, so the schedule must have some built-in flexibility, and that\u2019s challenging. But it\u2019s essential. Second, I maintain perspective. Every night when I go to bed, I lie in the dark and take five minutes to remind myself that my kids are safe in their beds, we have a good roof over our heads and food in the kitchen, and I have a job that doesn\u2019t have me on my feet all day (I have a lot of respect for people in service-oriented jobs). It\u2019s a mental gratitude journal, reminding myself of the positives in my life, and it\u2019s essential to my well-being. The third thing I do is just keep moving. My life won\u2019t always be this busy, and if I keep moving, eventually I\u2019ll get to a point where it\u2019s a little less hectic. Sure, I\u2019ll always \u201ckeep busy,\u201d as my retired aunt says. And I certainly look forward to the day when I\u2019m able to choose how I spend my time. But for now, with the little time I have available for chosen activities, I choose blogging. I may be an accidental blogger, but I am a devoted one. And a grateful one, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://gapingvoid.com/", "http://www.bluehost.com/", "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/", "http://mamaedge.blogspot.com/", "http://www.ringsurf.com/ring/moiisinthehouse/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/02/17/on-blogging/", "title": "On Blogging"},
{"date": "February 14, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tSometimes, when you\u2019re the parent of a teen with autism, you have to write letters like this:\nDear [Regional Autism Consultant] and [Nigel\u2019s speech therapist],\nI hope this finds you both well. Nigel\u00a0continues to benefit from your social skills class, and I want to thank you both for doing it. I wanted to run something by you that I think would be an important addition to the regular social skills teaching. Today I had a meeting with [his case manager], and she mentioned that a student told\u00a0her about a situation in which Nigel was being taken advantage of and laughed at.\u00a0During lunch, a group of students were encouraging Nigel to tickle random people, and they would laugh when he did it. As you might remember, Nigel has been targeted in this\u00a0manner before, and it always pains me to hear of it.\nI would be so grateful if you would work\u00a0something into the social skills curriculum\u00a0to help\u00a0him learn to recognize these sorts of situations when people have fun at his expense by\u00a0telling him to do something inappropriate. He doesn\u2019t realize that it\u2019s inappropriate or that he could get in trouble for touching other people. He thinks he is making friends this way,\u00a0but the \u201cfriends\u201d are laughing at someone with a developmental disability. They know that Nigel lacks social awareness, and that\u2019s why they target him. They are not innocent little kids anymore. And yes, Nigel has been told before that real friends will not get him to do things that he shouldn\u2019t do and then laugh. But he needs constant reminders from people other than his mother. He needs to be taught how to recognize these sorts of situations. If a random student notices and takes the time to tell a staff member about it, then it\u2019s pretty significant. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not the first time, even though it was the first time that was brought to our attention (that I\u00a0know of).\nSo I think it would be helpful for Nigel to have some reminders about what\u2019s inappropriate at school, and that if someone tries to get him to do something and they are laughing about it, they probably don\u2019t have his best interests at heart, and they should be avoided. I tell him these things, of course, but I think if he hears it from other adults (or peers who care)\u00a0and is taught how to recognize those situations (perhaps through roll-play), then he might start to understand.\nThank you so much for your time and the work you do\u00a0with my son.\nBest regards,\nTanya Savko\nAnd it breaks your heart, again and again. You believed that things were going well socially at the high school, that the other kids had matured since middle school, that these things weren\u2019t happening any more. You hoped that no one would be insincere with him at his first dance, and you wonder if they were and your son just doesn\u2019t have the social awareness to realize it.\nSometimes, as the parent of a teen with autism, it hurts. You\u2019ve been advocating for over twelve years since the diagnosis, and you still have to do it. You still have to manage your pain and quell your anger. You have to keep moving, keep doing, keep hoping. You have to keep being the parent of a teen with autism.\nAnd no matter how much you love your son and the wonderful person that he is, no matter how far he\u2019s come and how much he\u2019s achieved and how high your hopes, it still hurts. For both of you.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/02/14/when-it-hurts/", "title": "When It Hurts"},
{"date": "February 20, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t[This post was originally published at Hopeful Parents.]\nI started watching The X-Files when my first child was born in 1994. I would often watch an entire episode with Nigel sleeping on my shoulder, gently rocking him as I waited for his father to get home from work. The show\u2019s then-unconventional subject matter of two FBI agents investigating strange crimes and bizarre phenomena appealed to me, and I continued to watch it until it ended in 2002.\nMeanwhile, in 1997, I started keeping my own files. That was the year that we began having Nigel evaluated for his lack of language development, among other concerns. We went through numerous tests, home visits, and various assessments over a six-week diagnostic period. And then we were told what the therapists probably knew much earlier: it was autism. Our first IFSP meeting was scheduled, early intervention services began, and my files grew. Six months later, I discovered the website for the Autism Society of America and was relieved that I now had some information that I could print out for relatives and friends to read \u2013 basic information about autism that had been so hard to find twelve years ago. I made copies and put them in the file.\nA year or so later, we began to realize that our younger son also exhibited signs of autism \u2013 a disheartening language delay and notable sensory issues. So he was also evaluated, and, although not diagnosed with autism, he still needed speech and occupational therapy. I started a file for him, too.\nThe years went on, and two kids with IEPs produce tons of paperwork. I saved most of it, wanting to have everything documented, trying to be a responsible special needs parent, and just not sure what needed to be saved and what didn\u2019t. In addition to the boys\u2019 individual files, I also kept files on general autism information as well as related special needs advocacy information. The files were both full of articles I\u2019d pulled from magazines and newspapers over the years, old clippings from genetic theories to the vaccine issue to stuff I\u2019d found on terbutaline and other neurotoxins. I clipped sidebars on teaching strategies, visual schedules, and sensory issues. There were reprints from early Newsweek and Time magazine cover stories on autism. I saved articles on biomedical treatments, various types of therapy, autism in adulthood, and special needs estate planning. My files covered a lot of ground.\nAnd last weekend, having the need to downsize to a smaller filing cabinet, I decided it was time to clean out what I\u2019d dubbed \u201cThe A-Files.\u201d I tackled my younger son\u2019s file first, smaller due to the fact that he had no longer needed an IEP by the time he turned ten (three years ago). I saved a few of the more important IEP copies and his early evaluations. Then I moved on to my firstborn, whose file had actually torn at the top from the weight of it, and been taped. His, of course, took much longer to wade through, but I think I did a good job of judiciously separating the grain from the chaff. It felt odd to go back so far, to see things that I\u2019d written \u2013 behavioral observations, for example \u2013 eight, ten, and twelve years ago. I was struck by how little I understood of autism then, but also by how determined I was to help my son.\nBy the time I got to the last file, the general autism file, I didn\u2019t realize how fragile I was. I had breezed through my younger son\u2019s file, and although I had lingered considerably longer on my older son\u2019s file, I felt like I did all right with it. I thought that I\u2019d kept my emotions at bay. But I had barely begun to sort through that last file when my face suddenly twisted into a grimace of pain and sorrow. A hideous sob racked my chest. The jig was up.\nI know what it was that finally got to me. It was the printed evidence that autism has shaped our lives. Maybe I subconsciously thought that all this paperwork would somehow help. That saving it was like some sort of a karmic point system, that it would make a difference, sitting in my filing cabinet. All that documentation, all that information. Evidence. Unresolved, just sitting there. Like that show I used to watch.\nBut then the sobs subsided as quickly as they\u2019d begun. I realized that autism shaping our lives isn\u2019t just about the negative. Yes, it\u2019s often been very hard. There are plenty of things that I wish could have been different. But in those files are also many positive reports of progress \u2013 the gradual meeting of goals that seemed too lofty when written, emerging skills, developing ability. That, too, is evidence. Evidence of determination, commitment, and hope. You can bet I\u2019m saving that paperwork.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/02/20/the-a-files/", "title": "The A-Files"},

{"date": "February 28, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tEmotionally, we take flight when the strength of our passion exceeds the strength of our blockages; the floodgates open and we are free to feel fully.\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014Daily Om\nIt wouldn\u2019t be stretching things to say that I\u2019ve been an emotional wreck lately. I\u2019ve been pushing myself to meet deadlines both at work and at home, and it frustrates me to no end to not be able to meet my goals. I try not to let the reality of my situation\u2014being a full-time single parent\u2014get in the way of what I want to achieve, but the undeniable fact is that it often does. Combine that with my increasing concern over Nigel\u2019s academic/work challenges and his social vulnerability, and it\u2019s no surprise that I\u2019m overwhelmed.\nSo, everything has been on the surface lately, emotionally speaking. Every day has been like a marathon. This week could not end soon enough. The boys and I got home Friday afternoon, did a bunch of chores, ate dinner, and then Nigel and I went to our local grocery store for a few things. First, we recycled our bottles and cans at those machines that count and crush them and dispense receipts for the deposit refund. At one point, the plastic machine got stuck, and I took a leap of faith and instructed Nigel to go inside the store and tell an employee. Okay, he said, and he went and did it. I had never had him do that before, but he certainly knows how to ask for help while looking for a certain DVD at the video store, so I figured he could do this. Moments later he returned and said that someone would be out soon to fix it. My heart nearly burst. I had no idea how it actually went down in there, but the end result was that Nigel got his point across. A guy came out in a few minutes to fix the machine, and inside I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. Even now, I never take anything for granted. Even the simplest of things.\nAfterward, we went inside to wash our hands and do our shopping. Nigel found the DVD he wanted to rent, and it was only fifty cents. Without my prior knowledge, everything I had already planned to get was on sale \u2013 the organic butter lettuce, the Virgil\u2019s Black Cherry Cream Soda, the Haagen Dazs dark-chocolate-on-chocolate ice cream bars. I could see Nigel across the store picking out some candy for himself, and even at fifteen, he just looked so sweet. I reveled in feeling my mother-love. It was like this little trip to the grocery store was my gift for having such a tough week. But the best gift of all was yet to come.\nWe got in line at the checkout counter and put our things on the belt. As we stood waiting, I heard a girl\u2019s voice say, \u201cHey, Nigel, how are you?\u201d This was not the first time someone had greeted him in the grocery store, and I quickly assessed her. Some kids make a show of saying hello to Nigel in a manner that indicates that they see him as a novelty. Some kids are nice enough, sincere even, but they don\u2019t really understand him. And once in a great while, a kid will say hello to Nigel, and it\u2019s real. I could tell instantly that this girl was real. She was genuine. Just lovely. Nigel said hi, accepted a hug from her (with his trademark stiffness, which didn\u2019t faze her in the least), and then told her, \u201cThis is my mom.\u201d She looked me in the eye, and in my ridiculous current emotional state, it was all I could do not to cry. I wanted to hug her. Because I knew. I just knew that she was the type of kid that we parents of ASD kids hope for. The angels that look out for our kids when we\u2019re not there. I felt it with my entire being\u2014she was definitely one of them. And so, suppressing my urge to throw my arms around her, I told her my name and shook her hand and smiled. And I hoped that my smile conveyed my deepest appreciation. Thank you, sweet girl. Thank you for caring about my son. For not only respecting him, but for including him. Thank you for being the wonderful person I know you are.\nAfter our brief exchange, Nigel told her that he had rented The Time Machine. Not only did she say that it\u2019s a good movie, but when he mentioned that it was based on a book, she knew who had written the book (H.G. Wells) and said that she\u2019d read it and liked it! She totally gets him! Then she said a few more things to Nigel as I paid for our items, and she left. Nigel and I picked up our bags and walked outside. \u201cShe seems really nice,\u201d I said. \u201cYeah,\u201d Nigel said. \u201cShe\u2019s in my theater class.\u201d\nThe tears came then, and I was glad that it was now dark. I hoped that Nigel couldn\u2019t see them, because they would be so hard to explain. Hell, I wasn\u2019t even sure why I was crying. Was it happiness? Relief? Why do so many emotions\u2014especially unidentifiable ones\u2014drive me to tears?\nIn the end, I think I was just overcome with gratitude. Not just because she was so good to my son, but because, at that moment, she was unwittingly there for me, when I needed her most. At the end of a long, hard, emotional week, she was there. She\u2019s not only Nigel\u2019s angel, she\u2019s mine, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2009/9/18/rosie-1.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/02/28/emotional-rescue/", "title": "Emotional Rescue"},
{"date": "February 24, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nA quick look at my Amazon Wish List conveys what\u2019s been on my mind lately: my son\u2019s future. I mean, it\u2019s obvious when you look at the titles \u2013\n\nBecoming Remarkably Able: Walking the Path to Talents, Interests, and Personal Growth, For Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders and Related Disabilities\nAutism & the Transition to Adulthood: Success Beyond the Classroom\nDeveloping Talents: Careers For Individuals With Asperger Syndrome And High-functioning Autism\nLife and Love: Positive Strategies for Autistic Adults\nAdults on the Autism Spectrum Leave the Nest: Achieving Supported Independence\nThe Autism Transition Guide: Planning the Journey from School to Adult Life\n\nNow that Nigel is fifteen (and a half), we really need to get going on his transitioning plan. But how? How do you do plan for adulthood when your high schooler has the emotional maturity of a ten-year-old? He talks about wanting to go to college, which is great. But how can I realistically plan for that when he can\u2019t handle the modified workload of his freshman year of high school?\nYes, Nigel can progress. He has proven that over the years. He is handling things now that I would have never thought possible, even three years ago. So it is within the realm of possibility that three years from now, he could be going through the admissions process for college. But as much as I believe in my son, that\u2019s a big maybe.\nYou see, Nigel lacks executive function. And I don\u2019t just mean that it\u2019s challenging for him. I mean that it\u2019s pretty much nonexistent. This is why he requires one-on-one assistance in his classes and two study period pull-outs every day to do his regular classwork (with constant assistance). Every advancement he\u2019s made in Boy Scouts is because an adult (usually me) has walked him through it, outlined the work for him, and kept him on track. He is unable to do it himself.\nAnd so, I worry if college is a realistic goal for Nigel. He is certainly intelligent \u2013 he\u2019s just not able to do the work, nor is he motivated to. And college is a lot of work. There are no IEPs in college, no educational assistants hovering over him to keep him focused. There\u2019s no modified curriculum. I know that there are programs to help people on the autism spectrum navigate college as far as housing and living independently. But they don\u2019t write the students\u2019 papers. They don\u2019t do the work for them. That\u2019s what executive function is for. Either you have it or you don\u2019t.\nI suppose that it\u2019s something he could be taught, but that\u2019s one of the things I tried to do when I homeschooled him for a year and a half. I taught him how to do math problems step-by-step, how to write essays, organize his thoughts, and outline. And it didn\u2019t take. I don\u2019t think his brain functions that way. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t ready for it at the time, but it wasn\u2019t that long ago, and at this point, time is of the essence.\nAll I\u2019ve ever wanted for my children was for them to feel loved and to lead happy, fulfilling lives. I know that doesn\u2019t have to involve college, but Nigel\u2019s dream of being an astronaut does. And there are times when I wonder if all the years of therapy got him to a really good point, but it\u2019s not good enough. We got him to the point where he can communicate verbally and go to restaurants and grocery stores and interact with people and make a grilled cheese sandwich and ride his bike to school and back independently, but he can\u2019t work independently. And while I am so happy and proud and grateful that he is able to do all those things that were impossible for years,\u00a0that glaring\u00a0difficulty remains.\u00a0Once more with feeling:\u00a0he can\u2019t work independently.

{"date": "November 1, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nLong-time readers of this blog might remember that last November I participated in NaNoWriMo (National Novel-Writing Month). The object was to complete a 50,000-word (approximately 170-page) novel in 30 days, and somehow I did it! It\u2019s a very rough draft, of course, and I intend for the finished book to be double the pages, so I still have more work to do on that one. This year, I was very excited about trying my hand at another one. I had a plot outline and character sketches that I\u2019d been toying with for a while. I was looking forward to being Kyra\u2018s \u201cwriting buddy\u201d as I was Vicki\u2018s last year. I was anticipating another November of frantic but thoroughly enjoyable writing sessions. I couldn\u2019t wait.\nAnd then, a week or so ago, reality hit. I took a good, long, objective look at my life at the moment. Last year, I was working part-time while I homeschooled Nigel; this year I\u2019m working full-time and also took on the volunteer position of the Southern Oregon Chapter Rep for the Autism Society of Oregon. And with all the regular\u00a0insanity of raising two children by myself, there\u2019s just no time for NaNo this year. And I\u2019m deeply disappointed.\nSo, I\u2019ve decided to do NaNoWriMo SP*, the single parent version. The object is still to write a novel of at least 50,000 words, but there is no time limit. Because, by God, if you can write a novel while working full-time and raising children by yourself, well, it doesn\u2019t matter how long it takes. The fact that you\u2019re doing it at all is mind-blowing. And this way you\u2019ll still get to experience frantic-but-thoroughly-enjoyable writing sessions. All year long!\n\u00a0\n*yes, I made it up. But I really think the NaNo people should consider offering this as an option for the more time-challenged writers who want to participate.

{"date": "April 19, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tMy son has memorized the dialogue of many movies. Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, the old Pink Panther movies with Peter Sellers, various Scooby Doo adventures, Winnie the Pooh, and numerous other Disney films. Over the years I\u2019ve often wondered if this ability to memorize movie dialogue crosses over into other areas of his memory. And it does, a bit. While it\u2019s true that he can spell any word he\u2019s ever read, and has an uncanny ability to remember dates and places of historical events, his memory for his own daily life generally isn\u2019t as dependable.\nOn a recent trip to the grocery store, I was curious if Nigel remembered how traumatic it was for him to be in them when he was younger, how his sensory issues were so extreme that all the noises of the grocery store were agonizing to him and he would scream and writhe on the floor. He did not remember a thing. It was as if his mind had mercifully blocked the painful memories. I thought perhaps he didn\u2019t remember because the majority of those incidents occurred when he was mostly non-verbal, aside from his cries of \u201cGo! Go!\u201d mixed in with his screams.\nPart of me was disappointed because I thought that his memories would be valuable for several reasons. For one, I think it would buoy his self-esteem to see how far he\u2019s come. Also, it would be fascinating if he could shed some light on what made things so hard for him, how he felt, and what he was thinking. Of course, the answers to those questions are obvious (The sounds hurt his ears! He felt tortured! What was he thinking? That he needed to get out of there!), but I just know that there\u2019s so much to be learned from him, from his experiences. And so I figured that if he couldn\u2019t remember the difficult parts of his non-verbal days, he couldn\u2019t remember the good parts either.\n\nEnter Tigger. Tigger is pretty celebrated around here. I\u2019ve mentioned before how Nigel\u2019s stuffed Tigger (bought at Disneyland during my pregnancy) prompted him to write the first little note he\u2019d ever written. The Tigger and Winnie the Pooh stories and videos have also taught Nigel about friendship. And Tigger is responsible for enabling Nigel to do the first imaginative thing he\u2019d ever done. Nigel used to like eating frozen corn niblets. He wouldn\u2019t eat them cooked, only frozen. I would pour them in a little bowl and he would eat them with his fingers. One night when he was four years old, I poured some in bowl and put it on the kitchen table for him to eat. While I prepared some toast for Aidan, Nigel got out of his chair and ran out of the kitchen. He came back a moment later with Tigger. He gently put Tigger\u2019s face in the bowl of frozen corn niblets and said, \u201cEat\u201d in his little voice, his voice that was actually forming a word, stoic even from the beginning. I was beside myself with joy.\nFast forward ten years. Nigel, now fourteen, still loves Tigger and sleeps with him on his bed. He came to me a couple of nights ago and told me that he wanted to feed Tigger some corn again, like he did when he was little. My spine tingled. \u201cYou remember that?\u201d I asked incredulously. He confirmed that he did. He said that he remembered how he felt and what he thought back then, that it made him happy to feed Tigger, and that he believed that he was really eating the corn. He said that having Tigger around all these years helps him to remember something from so long ago.\n\u201cMaybe Tigger has a magical quality because he was a gift of love,\u201d Nigel said. I told him that he was probably right. And then he said, \u201cLove reveals its capabilities in unexpected ways.\u201d\nI had to turn away, not wanting him to see my eyes welling with tears. \u201cYes, Nigel, it certainly does.\u201d And I realized that what he said might have been a line memorized from a movie. But so what if it was? He chose the perfect time to say it. And it was beautiful.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/04/19/the-wonderful-thing-about-tigger/", "title": "The Wonderful Thing About Tigger"},
{"date": "April 30, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tMy father, who lives about 600 miles away, is coming up for a visit this weekend. We try to see each other at least once a year and have a good relationship. We do, however, differ in our religious views and practices. My dad is an Eastern Orthodox Christian, and I \u2013 how to put this diplomatically? \u2013 am on my own path.\nI wanted my kids to have a basic knowledge of historical biblical events and an acquaintance with the stories I had grown up with. After all, they are ingrained in so much of our culture. When someone mentions Moses and the Ten Commandments, David and Goliath, Adam and Eve, or, of course, Jesus and Mary, I want my sons to at least be familiar with them. Nigel loves the historical aspect of the Bible and any accounts of natural disasters and plagues. Aidan, I think, likes being able to assure his great-grandmother, a lifelong Catholic, that he knows about the Bible when she gives him a book on the lives of the saints or the real story of Christmas. She must figure that since we don\u2019t attend church, the kids would not know about these things. Regardless, Aidan graciously accepts whatever book she brings for him.\nBut Nigel is not able to understand that religion is personal, that people could easily be insulted if he is not reverent about their beliefs. On his own, he has researched and espoused evolutionism; he values its scientific basis. It does not surprise me that it appeals to him, due to his own evolution within the parameters of autism. Even so, he still has some room for God in his belief system. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of half-and-half,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m undecided.\u201d And that\u2019s okay. He has enough to figure out with learning algebra, writing essays, processing sensory input, regulating his emotions, and navigating the social realm of his peers. Trying to understand religion might be too much for him now. Yet, biblical history, like all history, fascinates Nigel.\nSeveral years ago, we had visited my dad at his home, and at the time, his living room also functioned as a part-time chapel for his church group. The room was filled with lavish icons on the walls, crosses, and prayer books. One icon depicted Jesus carrying the cross on his back. Nigel took it all in, but did not say anything as his verbal skills were undeveloped then. A few years later, my dad moved, and this time when we went to visit, Nigel commented on the icons. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the God stuff?\u201d he asked me, in no way realizing that his question had been worded irreverently. I explained to him that it was part of Grandpa\u2019s religion and that it was very important to him.\nAnd so, in an effort to show his grandfather that he respected his beliefs, the following year when Grandpa came to visit us at our house, Nigel had an idea. He must have wanted to surprise everyone, because he didn\u2019t tell me about it ahead of time. Shortly after my father had arrived and was in the guest room unpacking, I walked into my room to get something and saw, through my bedroom window, some movement in the backyard. It was Nigel. He had taken some boards from the old backyard fence that had recently been taken out and nailed them together to form a life-size cross. And he held it on his back over one shoulder and, hunched over as he had seen Jesus in Grandpa\u2019s icon, was slowly carrying it across the backyard.\nMy father has always been very accepting of Nigel\u2019s autism and supportive. But he doesn\u2019t always understand the myriad ways in which autism affects Nigel. I didn\u2019t want him to see Nigel with the cross because I feared that he would think that Nigel was making fun of Jesus. Nigel, at age 10, did not have the capacity to make fun of anyone or anything, but when you aren\u2019t able to spend much time with an autistic child, you don\u2019t always realize that. You wouldn\u2019t know how differently he thinks compared to other kids.\nSo I sprinted outside and told Nigel that I knew he was trying to be respectful, but that other people wouldn\u2019t see it that way. And I told him that I didn\u2019t want him getting splinters or poking himself with nails. He looked confused. \u201cI\u2019m being Jesus,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, honey, I know. And you\u2019re doing a really good job. I\u2019m sure Jesus would be pleased. But he wouldn\u2019t want you to get hurt on the rusty nails.\u201d Nigel seemed to agree with that. We set the cross on the woodpile and went back in the house. And I thought, isn\u2019t that what Christianity is really about? Being Jesus? No matter what path he\u2019s on, I can\u2019t help but think that Nigel\u2019s got more figured out than I could ever realize.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_christian"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/04/30/autism-and-religion/", "title": "Autism and Religion"},

But a closer look reveals a secret weapon or two:\n\nAnyone who knows Nigel knows that mowing the lawn is not an easy thing for him to accomplish. Here\u2019s what\u2019s working against him:\n1) Sensory issues, the obvious offender. Notice the ear plugs to help muffle the sound of the mower and the sunglasses to fend off the glare of the sun.\n2) Nigel\u2019s fear of bees and other flying insects. Notice the long-sleeved shirt and jeans even on the warm day.\n3) Nigel\u2019s inherent lack of understanding about household responsibility and his lack of desire to contribute.

Seeing other teenagers in the neighborhood mowing their lawns. Nigel\u2019s desire to \u201cbe like everybody else\u201d was motivating enough for him to brave the elements and take some responsibility around the house.

{"date": "April 23, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\u201cIndependent functioning is not simply the ability to do something, but also the ability to decide what to do. It is not only the ability to take care of oneself. It is also the ability to take responsibility for oneself.\u201d \u2014 Elaine Heffner (20th century), U.S. psychiatrist and author\nMichelle at The Sneathen Family Site, one of the blogs I read regularly, posed an excellent question at the end of a recent post. She asked, \u201cWhen, if ever, have you let your kids stay home for short periods on their own?\u201d And since one of the most common searches used to find Teen Autism is \u201cshould an autistic teen be left home alone,\u201d I thought I would do a search myself. There are plenty of parenting sites out there that offer guidelines for non-autistic kids and staying home alone. Given the fact that I couldn\u2019t find much when I added autism into the mix, I figured that this subject warranted a post.\nI started letting Nigel stay home alone for short periods starting at age twelve. We began with 20-minute increments and worked our way up to a few hours. I felt comfortable with that only after he had shown proficiency in the following areas:\n1) Being able to call out if necessary and taking periodic check-in calls from Mom\n2) Not opening the door for anyone, unless it\u2019s the neighbor yelling \u201cFire!\u201d Fortunately, that\u00a0second part\u00a0has not happened.\n3) Knowing how to get out of the house quickly and where to go if something blows up\n4) Staying in the house the entire time unless something blows up\n5) Not doing anything that could cause anything to blow up\nI reluctantly admit that we have had problems with items 4 and 5 on that list, resulting in the suspension of staying-home-alone privileges for periods of time. Apparently, the euphoria of being home alone sometimes causes my son to climb the 40-foot high tree in the backyard or set the couch cover on fire using a magnifying glass. Thus, he is also working on impulse control. For an autistic teen yearning to be independent, this is quite motivating, because he detests having his home-alone privileges revoked.\nSo, basically, what it boils down to is a combination of verbal ability and safety awareness. If Nigel did not have the ability to use the phone in an emergency, I would not consider leaving him home alone. His safety awareness has been developing for the past few years, and even though he \u201cforgets\u201d the home-alone rules once in a while, he is constantly improving. Someday, I may even return his magnifying glass to him.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://sneathenfamily.blogspot.com/", "http://sneathenfamily.blogspot.com/2009/04/independence.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/04/23/staying-home-alone/", "title": "Staying Home Alone"},
{"date": "April 28, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tFirst and foremost, thank you all so much for your thoughts, your prayers, and your love. Aidan\u2019s surgery yesterday was successful, and he is already recovering remarkably well. I feel truly blessed to be a part of such a caring community of people. Aidan was in good hands yesterday, and even though I was relieved to see him after surgery, I knew that he would be all right.\nNigel, it would seem, was not as confident. I made it a point for him to not go to school yesterday so that he would be at the hospital with us for a few different reasons. One, I knew that he would be anxious all day long knowing that his brother was in surgery, and if I had him go to school, his behavior would have reflected that. In the past, he has not done well at school when Aidan was just home with an illness. Nigel would not have done well at school if I had sent him. Two, I wanted Nigel (and Aidan) to know that when family members go to have surgery, their family members go with them. We have to be there for each other. Lastly, I wanted him to experience being in a hospital for several hours and know what that\u2019s like and learn to handle it.\nWe got to the hospital at 7 AM to check Aidan in, and his surgery began at 8:15. Shortly before that, his dad (who drove 700 miles to be here for the surgery) and I took turns leaning over Aidan to kiss him and tell him that we love him and we\u2019d see him soon. Then Nigel walked\u00a0up and leaned over Aidan, who immediately put up an arm to fend off any potential brother kisses. I think Nigel expected that. He held his position and just said, \u201cHang in there.\u201d And that was when I wanted to cry. Because Nigel somehow figured out a way to let his brother know that he cared without alienating him. I put my arm around him and led him out to the waiting area and told him that he\u2019d said the perfect thing to his brother.\nTo distract Nigel during the surgery, we went down to the hospital cafeteria to get some breakfast. Nigel had corn flakes and a bowl of watermelon chunks, and I had a somewhat rubbery omelette. We went back to the waiting area and Nigel watched a movie on his portable DVD player until we were paged that the surgery was finished. At that point we went back to Aidan\u2019s room to talk with the surgeon, who assured us that everything had gone well and showed us photos of what had been removed. Twenty minutes later, Aidan was wheeled in, not only conscious but talking with the nurses as they were coming down the hall. It felt so good to see his sweet face. I kissed his forehead and he said, \u201cMom, could you kiss my lips?\u201d Then he showed us his four incisions and told Nigel about the anesthetic. After a few minutes we all sat down and resumed reading/TV watching while Aidan dozed.\nNigel, however, was transfixed on the machine that read Aidan\u2019s vitals. He would not take his eyes off of it and updated me on its status every minute or so. \u201cIt looks like he\u2019s having a really crazy dream,\u201d \u201cWhat do those letters stand for?\u201d, \u201cIt dropped below 90,\u201d and even \u201cMom! It looked like he almost flat-lined for a second!\u201d At the time, it seemed like Nigel was just entertained by the mechanical device. But last night, I started to wonder if he was truly concerned, if he really feared for his brother\u2019s welfare. He kept his vigil the entire time Aidan was hooked up to the machines, as if he thought that Aidan was in critical condition. Even hours after we came home and Aidan was obviously fine, Nigel complained of a stomachache and had worked himself into such an anxious state that he threw up.\nIn recent years, Nigel has shown an increasing empathetic nature. Whether it\u2019s for a nervous friend or a cat that was accidentally stepped on, he shows empathy. And so does he and so does she. And many others, I\u2019m sure, collectively refuting the old \u201cASD people don\u2019t show empathy\u201d myth. Not only do they show it, they feel it so intensely that they become upset over it. So yes, there is definitely empathy. There is compassion and support. There is an older brother looking out for his younger brother. And there is love.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://whittereronautism.com/2009/03/the-theory-of-mind-is-still-with-us/", "http://michelleoneilwrites.blogspot.com/2009/04/lacking-empathy-my-ass.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/04/28/his-brothers-keeper/", "title": "His Brother\u2019s Keeper"},
{"date": "April 26, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nWhen we last heard from the hormone-addled, resident autistic teen about the subject of dating, he was coming up with a plan for the parents of the girl he\u2019s interested in to become familiar with him. And the autistic teen\u2019s mother was encouraging him to wait until high school.\nWell, folks, that waiting period is nearing its end. Eighth grade is almost over. And Nigel has begun to make his move. He informed me last week that he had \u201cfinally\u201d told the long-time object of his affection how he feels about her by writing a note. I asked him if he hand-wrote it or typed it, and he said that he hand-wrote it, which must have been quite an undertaking for him. \u00a0\u00a0He said that he wrote of her \u201cbeauty and grace,\u201d and that he feared, in telling her, that she would feel uncomfortable around him. He wrote that, too. Holding my breath, I asked him how Stephanie responded to the note. \u201cShe was okay with it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s still my friend.\u201d And then he nonchalantly bit into an apple and walked out of the kitchen.\nHere\u2019s the back story: For months, Nigel has talked about this girl. In the early stages, it was \u201cShe understands my difference.\u201d This was when he still attended the middle school full time. Then, after I began homeschooling him, he would go for walks in the neighborhood and stand in front of her house, hoping she would come out to talk to him. A few times he knocked on the door, and her parents politely declined. He would film his Lego videos in his room, and I would hear him say in an announcer\u2019s voice the names of the people starring in the film; Stephanie always received top billing. When I would\u00a0pick him up from\u00a0his weekly social skills class at the middle school, he asked me if we could find Stephanie\u2019s class so that he could say hello. Since, at the time, he was not officially a student, we could not.\nAnd then, six weeks ago, he began attending the middle school again, part-time. I would pick him up from his half day and ask how lunch went, since that time is unsupervised, and he used to be targeted then. \u201cFine,\u201d he would answer. \u201cStephanie sat with me. I think I\u2019m in love.\u201d I wanted to hug this girl, to thank her for being so kind to my son. But I also wanted to gently prepare Nigel for the disappointment of unrequited love. I would tell him that he had to remember that people don\u2019t always have the same feelings toward each other, that someone might want a person to be their boyfriend or girlfriend, but that person just wants to be friends. I told him that that happens to people of all ages, including adults, whether they\u2019re autistic or not. It\u2019s just a part of life.\nWhat I didn\u2019t know when Nigel told me about giving Stephanie the note was that there was a school dance two days later. And Nigel wanted to go. I\u2019m sure he had hoped that Stephanie would have wanted to be more than just friends for the occasion of the dance, but even in the face of polite rejection, Nigel still wanted to go. I was very proud of how he was handling his emotions in this situation \u2013 he was showing exceptional maturity for someone with a lower emotional age. And that is why I felt confident letting him go to the dance without an aide. He had attended another dance three months before, but the school required him to have an aide with him, and things went well. Nigel remembered that stipulation. When he asked me about going to the new dance, he quickly added, \u201cI asked the deans and they said it was okay that I could go without M,\u201d (his previous aide). And my heart soared, not only because the deans had approved it, but because Nigel had thought to ask. He took it upon himself to make something happen that was important to him. And he did it the right way.\nI still felt a little nervous about him attending the dance alone. But he excitedly told me that it wasn\u2019t just a dance \u2013 there would be an obstacle course, video games, and other activities. I suggested ear plugs for the two-hour sensory bombardment. \u201cNo, Mom, I want to be like everybody else.\u201d So I dropped him off with five dollars and came home to wring my hands, waiting for the phone call about some behavioral incident.\nBut there were no calls. I went early to pick him up, so that I could park near the entrance. I regretted not reminding him to come out front as soon as it was over. I had, however, rehearsed with him what he would do if anyone came up to him and started harassing him. I dreaded the thought that, here he was, trying so hard, and someone who enjoyed giving him a hard time would just come along and get him riled up and ruin the evening. I envisioned walking up to the double doors to pick him up and one of the teachers would pull me aside and tell me about a \u201csituation.\u201d Ugh.\nBut less than a minute after I walked up to the double doors, Nigel came striding toward me from another direction, flushed and happy. He had won with the fastest time on the obstacle course. That\u2019s great, I told him. Did you see Stephanie? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think she was here. But I still had fun.\u201d Did anyone bother you? I asked tentatively. \u201cNo, Mom. No one bothers me anymore.\u201d I hugged him and said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad.

{"date": "September 2, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tThis is the week for me. The mad-dash week before school starts. All parents know how it is with registration, getting school supplies, checking schedules, that kind of thing. And all special needs parents know how it is with the added emails, calls, meetings, walk-throughs, etc. that are necessary in getting our children set up with the support systems they need to be successful. In a transition year \u2013 either starting at a new school or at a new level of school \u2013 those efforts are doubled.\nThis year Nigel starts high school, so he\u2019s at a new level and a new school. \u00a0With all the stress I\u2019ve been experiencing lately, I feel like sitting in a corner and rocking, stimming my stress away. So far it\u2019s gone smoothly getting things set up for him, but there is so much time, effort, and energy (mental, emotional, and physical) involved that I feel like I am nearing a breakdown. I so want this to work for him. I want him to be comfortable and confident. I want his needs to be met. I want him to be accepted and appreciated. I want him to focus and learn and also have fun. I don\u2019t want to worry about getting calls at work about behavioral issues because someone has purposefully pushed his buttons. I don\u2019t want to worry about what our options are if this doesn\u2019t work. Please, please, please God, let this work. Let him be happy. \nWe went to registration today, and then met Nigel\u2019s new case manager. How must this woman feel? I\u2019m sure she\u2019s aware of the fact that we special needs parents place so much hope in her. I know she\u2019s aware of that. In fact, she must have picked up on my desperate vibe, because at one point she said to Nigel, \u201cI\u2019m your school mom.\u201d No one has ever said that before. And I wanted to cry and hug her and thank her because she obviously gets it. She knows how important her role is. I sometimes wonder if these professionals who work so tirelessly with our children, who are devoted to their success and well-being, feel the strain that we parents feel at the beginning of the school year. This combination of hope and anxiety. I should come up with a name for it. After all, it\u2019s not just at the beginning of the school year that I feel it.\nAnyway, when she said, \u201cI\u2019m your school mom,\u201d Nigel gave a small, cute smile, like he thought the idea of a \u201cschool mom\u201d was silly. But I sensed that it comforted him, and he understood her meaning. In that brief meeting, she really listened to him. I could tell that he felt respected, and comfortable. The regional autism consultant, who has known him since his nonverbal days, was also at the meeting, talking about his strengths and making recommendations. His speech therapist from the past three years was there, and we found out that she would continue to work with him and facilitate the social skills class that he will take. I feel very optimistic, even though the anxiety is hovering in the back of my mind.\nHowever, the bottom line, the \u201ctake-away,\u201d is that Nigel didn\u2019t just attend this meeting. He participated. He was slow to answer at times, rarely made eye contact, and was frequently off-topic with his requests and comments, but he was an integral person. And he even remembered to cover his mouth when he yawned, which shocked me after all these years of telling him it\u2019s the polite thing to do. I swear I think it was the first time he ever did it on his own.\nBut at this meeting he accomplished things that were so much more important than being polite. He spoke up and discussed his needs. He told us which subjects he needed to take at the lower level, and which he didn\u2019t. He mentioned his experience with bullying. He advocated for himself. And I am sitting here in tears as I write this, because the boy who, at the age of five, could not tell a doctor his own name is now advocating for himself. He really is. And I sense that this is only the beginning. It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to tell me, Mom, I got this. I know it\u2019s not time for me to step back yet. No, there is still much more work for me to do.\u00a0 But it\u2019s time for me to let him step up. He\u2019s part of the team. Yes, he is.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/09/02/its-time/", "title": "It\u2019s Time"},
{"date": "September 6, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tIn addition to meeting with Nigel\u2019s new case manager last week and doing a walk-through at the high school, we had another reason for going there. Nigel needed to do a dry run of riding his bike to school.\nYes, despite past reactions to insects flying in his face, he wants to do this. And I need to let him. He has a fiercely independent spirit, which I think has served him well and will continue to. We have gone over safety concerns ad nauseam, and I think he\u2019s ready. I have to trust that he can do this.\nSo, that afternoon on the way to the high school, he rode his bike and I waited a few minutes before following in the car. It\u2019s only a mile to the school, but there are several stop signs and intersections along the way, and his job was to time himself so we would know what time he needs to leave the house in the mornings. I told him to ride at a normal pace, to stop at all the stop signs, and not try to hurry up if I passed him.\nI pulled out of our driveway and drove to the first intersection and turned. There, about a hundred yards ahead of me, was Nigel on his bike, gesturing to three teenage girls as he rode past them. It looked like he was either giving them a thumbs-up or pointing ahead in the direction of the high school. I couldn\u2019t tell what he was doing. But after he passed them and continued on, I could tell what they were doing. They were mimicking his gestures in an exaggerated manner. And laughing.\nUnfortunately I have witnessed my son being laughed at many times. But because of that, I have learned how to respond in the most results-oriented way. I have lectured other kids, I have spoken angrily to them, I have glared at them. These reactions are instinctive. Of course, as parents, we are angry, we are incensed, at seeing our children disrespected in this manner. We want to lash out and make it right, even if our children weren\u2019t aware of what happened at their expense. But what I have learned over the years is that if I approach the kids in an open, positive manner, most will respond much better than if I approach them with anger.\nNigel was at least 50 yards ahead and didn\u2019t notice me pull up to the three girls. I rolled down my window, smiled, and asked if I could talk to them for a minute. \u201cDo you know that boy on the bike who just rode by?\u201d Two didn\u2019t, one said she had seen him when she was at the middle school two years ago. I continued in a pleasant voice. \u201cWell, I just thought you should know that he has autism, and he\u2019s my son.\u201d I could see a little embarrassment on their faces. \u201cOhhh,\u201d they said, \u201che has autism? We didn\u2019t know.\u201d I was glad that they seemed to know what autism was. Years ago, when he was younger, people didn\u2019t. \u201cYes,\u201d I continued. \u201cMost people don\u2019t realize that, so I wanted to mention that to you. He\u2019s going to be starting at the high school next week, so I just wanted to let you know in case you see him around. Sometimes people with autism have behavior that\u2019s a little different; thanks for understanding.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d they all said, and the older girl said, \u201cThanks for telling us.\u201d I thanked them again and drove off.\nOn my last post, M of Incipient Turvy had mentioned the following in his comment:\nI think the one thing people tend not to get (the general public, people not connected into autism issues) is the fact that every single step is uphill. There are no days you get to relax, not worry about it, coast on autopilot. If Nigel is in a public setting\u2026and especially a highly social environment like school\u2026every day requires vigilance, effort\u2026it\u2019s all uphill.\nEven when we have successful meetings, when Nigel participates and advocates for himself, we never get to sit back and relax. Every day we contend with people who don\u2019t understand, who might laugh at him, who might egg him on purposefully until he reacts in anger. These incidents will contribute to stress, self-esteem issues, and will definitely affect how well he does in school. It\u2019s a constant battle. All uphill, just like M said.\nAnd that\u2019s why I talk to people every chance I get. It\u2019s not easy for me, being an introvert, but it\u2019s what must be done. That day, I talked to three girls. Three people. A drop in the bucket. But getting those three people on our side might make even a slight difference. And I\u2019ll take it.\nA few minutes later, I parked at the school near the bike rack. Nigel soon rode up, dismounted, and began locking his bike on the rack. I walked over. \u201cDid you know those three girls back there?\u201d I asked him. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they seemed nice.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI think they will be.\u201d\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://incipientturvy.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/09/06/uphill/", "title": "Uphill"},
{"date": "June 11, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tLike many autistic people, Nigel\u2019s always had a hard time being around babies. He just can\u2019t filter the crying. It\u2019s one of the only sounds that he still hasn\u2019t been able to filter very well because of the unpredictable nature of it. That, and he just doesn\u2019t understand why they can\u2019t stop. It\u2019s hard for him to be patient or understanding because his ears are killing him. \u201cCan\u2019t that baby stop crying?\u201d he\u2019ll say when he hears one in a store. Telling him that the baby can\u2019t help it \u2013 or that he cried when he was a baby too \u2013 doesn\u2019t help at all. It\u2019s not about trying to develop understanding and patience. It\u2019s about needing relief for his sensitive hearing.\nAnd it started early on, too. Nigel was not yet two when Aidan was born, and Aidan had an even harder time with SPD than Nigel did. Poor Aidan spent about 80% of his waking life crying, and poor Nigel literally climbed the walls while Aidan did it. In fact, one of Nigel\u2019s first words \u2013 \u201ccying\u201d \u2013 was said to describe his brother. Cying = crying without the \u201cr\u201d. He couldn\u2019t say Mom or Dad, but he could say cying. \u201cYes, Aidan is crying,\u201d I would say, and Nigel would run out of the room.\nNigel has no memory of those days, but he still can\u2019t handle babies crying. He knows they can\u2019t help it, he now understands that, but he wishes they didn\u2019t have to do it. I told him that I\u2019m sure their parents feel the same way!\nBut, despite how he feels about babies, Nigel is excited to have a baby cousin. He went to see\u00a0Nolan shortly after he was born, and Nigel was a little nervous, but quite receptive. Now, Nolan is two months old, and we were very happy to have him (and his mom!) come to Nigel\u2019s graduation party this week. \u00a0Nolan was very willing to accommodate his cousin and only cried while his diaper was being changed. After Nolan was fed and happy, Nigel came over, smiled at him, and said, \u201cHi, Nolan. Hey, little guy.\u201d Nolan broke into a sweet grin and Nigel exclaimed, \u201cHe likes me!\u201d Then he said, \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s not ready for some Godzilla action.\u201d\n\nJust yawning, fortunately\u00a0. . .\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/06/11/the-baby-issue/", "title": "The Baby Issue"},
{"date": "June 7, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tWhen Nigel was 4-5 years old and not yet functionally verbal, he wanted so badly to play with the kids he would see at our local playground, but of course, he did not know how. I, preoccupied with toddler Aidan, would often have to intervene when Nigel would go up to a boy about his age and get in his face and start laughing. Nigel observed that when children played together, they would laugh, but he seemed to think that the laughter came first, that laughter would result in playing, and more laughter. Unfortunately, his tactic only resulted in the other kids getting either sad or angry \u2013 because they thought that Nigel was making fun of them. I would rush over and say, \u201cHe\u2019s not making fun of you. He\u2019s laughing because he wants to play with you,\u201d but the negative impression had already been made, and they would leave. Nigel couldn\u2019t ask me what he had done wrong. If I tried to explain it to him, he wouldn\u2019t have understood. The only thing he understood was laughter. Laughter meant playing. Laughter meant fun.\nThese days, Nigel understands much better how to approach his peers. He understands that in order to laugh with people, you have to start doing a fun activity first. Or \u2013 you can watch a funny movie together. And Nigel has discovered that this is the easiest way to achieve the laughter connection that he has craved all of his life.\nI don\u2019t remember how old he was the first time I watched a Peter Sellers/Inspector Clouseau movie with him. All I remember is how much he loved the fact that everyone watching was laughing together, which I\u2019m sure gave him a sense of security and completeness. Later, not only did he have a new source for his echolalia, he had a new response from his audience. He discovered that if he randomly dropped a line from one of those movies that he wouldn\u2019t be told \u201cLet\u2019s not say things from movies.\u201d No, he realized, the magic of saying something from a funny movie is that people will laugh.\nOver the years, he has branched out with his funny movies \u2013 got into The Three Stooges of course, and then the iconic Monty Python. He enjoyed some Saturday Night Live episodes, especially those featuring Chris Farley. It seems that slapstick appeals to him most, to his kinesthetic sense of processing. But the old Inspector Clouseau movies featured both slapstick and verbal comedy, so he could experience the best of both worlds with those. He could walk into a room, and in Clouseau\u2019s nasally voice ask, \u201cThe wax?\u201d and then slip on his feet and say \u201cAAAAHH!\u201d as he fell to the ground, and everyone would laugh. When saying goodbye to someone, he could salute and say, \u201cUntil we meet again and the case is sol-ved,\u201d causing more laughter. He could express his frustration with doing chores by imitating Clouseau\u2019s boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus, and say, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough!\u201d and has also been known to say, \u201cSomewhere, over the rainbow\u201d in a crazy voice while on the verge of a meltdown, just like Dreyfus did in the insane asylum. He has definitely used movie echolalia in a variety of situations.\nAnd in doing so, Nigel has finally mastered a way to meet his need for communal laughter. It\u2019s been many years since he laughed in someone\u2019s face to get them to laugh with him. What\u2019s really great is that he\u2019s discovered he can make people laugh just as much when he says his own funny lines. One day last week, he tripped over something, bumped into me, and caused me to knock over a glass of water. With each bungle he said a quick, \u201cSorry,\u201d and, with the last one, looked at me to check my response. I couldn\u2019t help but smile. It was all too funny \u2013 the tripping, the bumping, the sorrys, the spill \u2013 just like a scene out of a movie. Then, smirking, he said, \u201cI\u2019m getting more Clouseau-ish by the minute!\u201d and we both collapsed on the floor in laughter.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Clouseau", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/06/07/the-pursuit-of-laughter/", "title": "The Pursuit of Laughter"},
{"date": "June 16, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tWith the school year ending, it\u2019s time for me to hang up one of my hats \u2013 for good. For the past year and a half, I have been homeschooling Nigel, and in September he will attend the high school for a full day, so I will no longer be his academic teacher. When he started back at the middle school in March, it was only part-time, so I continued to homeschool him for language arts and social science. He made some amazing progress in those areas, writing a total of five essays, including a comparative analysis of Ancient Greek and Roman cultures. His case manager at the middle school was so impressed that she took a copy of that essay to give to his future teachers at the high school. I\u2019ll have to make sure they realize how much of an effort it was for him to complete that; it took him weeks to write it. They need to be aware of that before they expect him to produce more work \u2013 or at a faster pace \u2013 than he is capable of doing.\nAt any rate, come September my academic responsibility will be limited to helping him with assignments and encouraging his organizational skills. I will no longer be designing his curriculum, preparing lesson plans, or teaching the material. It was doable in middle school, even though it took me a while to get used to the idea, but I don\u2019t think I could do it for high school. I mean, I consider myself to be fairly intelligent, but there\u2019s a lot of high school knowledge that I would need to relearn in order to teach it to my son. It would take quite a bit of effort and time, and as a single parent of two, I\u2019m in short supply of those items. I also had to radically reduce my work hours so that I could homeschool Nigel for the amount of time that I did; as a result, my bank account is in sorry shape. So continuing to homeschool is really not an option, and I\u2019m glad that Nigel no longer needs it. We\u2019re both looking forward to his return to full-time regular school, for many reasons.\nBut there\u2019s something else that happens at the end of every school year, and has for the past eight years: Nigel and Aidan go visit their dad in Los Angeles for several weeks. LA is nearly 700 miles away from us; it\u2019s a long drive. And another world away. They get a taste of big-city life, get to bodysurf on warm beaches, and Nigel gets to go to\u00a0the day camp\u00a0for autistic kids. These are all things they get to do that they can\u2019t do at home in southern Oregon, and I am glad that they have the opportunity.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m also glad they get to spend time with their dad, whom they miss so much during the school year. But I miss them while they\u2019re gone every summer. It\u2019s just consuming, this missing. It\u2019s not like when they\u2019re gone for a week at Spring Break. One week is nothing. But seven, eight, is a daunting expanse that cannot be filled. Maybe I\u2019m being melodramatic \u2013 I mean, after all, we go through this every year. But it never gets easier. I walk down the hall and see their empty rooms. I can\u2019t watch a movie or eat ice cream without thinking of them and missing them. True, I\u2019m keeping busy, especially since I\u2019m back at work full-time, thanks to my wonderful employers. Life is full and good, but there\u2019s this void with the boys gone. It doesn\u2019t feel natural. I feel disjointed without them. And I\u2019ve got a long summer ahead of me.\nSince it\u2019s impossible for me to go more than a month without seeing them, I\u2019ll be visiting them next month, so that will break up the time, make it a little more bearable. For a while now, Nigel\u2019s been requesting to go to the Grand Canyon, so three weeks from today, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be doing. I can\u2019t wait to share another adventure with them, but mostly I can\u2019t wait to see them, hug them, to be in their presence. Of course, until then, I have phone calls to look forward to: \u201cHello, Mom. This is Nigel\u00a0[insert last name]\u00a0speaking.\u201d Or perhaps a conversation like this one. Oh, well. I\u2019m just\u00a0happy to\u00a0hear their voices.\nSo summer begins.\u00a0And it just dawned on me that I\u2019ve essentially combined two separate posts here \u2013 the end of homeschooling and missing my kids. Correlation? Nada. Let that be a testament to how disjointed I feel with my sons being away!

{"date": "June 9, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tDearest Nigel,\nThere are not enough words to express how proud I am of you today. A year ago, you anticipated your future eighth grade graduation, and I didn\u2019t know how to tell you that because you needed to homeschooled, you would not graduate from the local middle school. On your own, you figured that out, and you initiated a plan to be able to go back there, so that you could graduate with your peers. Five months ago, you told me that you wanted to try some medication that would help regulate your behavior so that you could go back to the middle school. We did, and two months later, you were back at the middle school part-time. Three months have gone by, and I am so proud to say that not once during that entire time did the school have to call me about any behavioral issues. Not once. And today, you graduated with your class of fellow eighth graders.\nCongratulations! You did it, Nigel. You did it. You set your sights on a goal and you worked to achieve it. But that should not surprise me, because that is what you have done your whole life. You were diagnosed with autism nearly twelve years ago, and you have continually shown me that although autism is an integral part of you, it alone does not define you. When diagnosed, and for some time after, you were completely nonverbal. Your sensory issues paralyzed you. I did not know back then that it was possible for any person with autism to progress as much as you have. The information was not available at the time, and I didn\u2019t know what to expect. I didn\u2019t know if you would learn to talk. I didn\u2019t know if you could be mainstreamed in school. I tried to be realistic, and I didn\u2019t dare to dream. But somewhere, deep down, I hoped.\nAll children learn, all children grow, but you have fought so hard to achieve that growth. You painstakingly learned to talk, to filter the agonizing sensory issues, to learn to function socially, to organize your thoughts. Many of these things you still work on, and will continue to. You will stop at nothing to work with your \u201cdifference,\u201d as you call it, to understand it (autism) and how it affects you, and to help others learn the same. You are learning to advocate for yourself, and I am proud of that, too.\nAnd so, my son, you inspire me. You have challenged me to be the best possible parent I can be because you needed the best from me.\u00a0 \u201cDifficult\u201d would be an understatement for the road we have traveled together. But Nigel, if you can do it, so can I. I will continue to be right beside you, letting you lead the way. We have a big transition coming up, but when I look at what you have achieved today, and what you have gone through to get here, I\u2019m daring to dream. I know you are too.\nAll my love,\nMom\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/06/09/a-letter-to-my-son-on-his-eighth-grade-graduation/", "title": "A Letter to My Son on His Eighth Grade Graduation"},
{"date": "June 14, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tLast weekend, Nigel had some friends spend the night for a little end-of-the-school-year party. I\u2019ve mentioned Nigel\u2019s friends, Nicholas and Tyler, before; Nicholas is Nigel\u2019s age and Tyler is Aidan\u2019s age. They are also brothers who are involved with Scouts, and we\u2019ve been fortunate to know their family for several years. They\u2019ve always been supportive and understanding of Nigel. I know that he values their friendship greatly, as do I.\nSo the boys had a blast, complete with pizza, root beer floats, gun fights, and a movie marathon. They\u2019ll indulge Nigel in watching his latest favorite disaster movie with him, and he doesn\u2019t mind if they fall asleep while they do. They\u2019ve seen Nigel melt down, they\u2019ve witnessed him being harassed at school, they know he\u2019s prone to movie echolalia, used to have a type of barking laugh, and can sometimes get a little carried away when he\u2019s having fun. They also know that sometimes he says things that are inappropriate or negative, and they realize that he doesn\u2019t always understand these things. They\u2019ve seen him at his worst, but they\u2019ve also seen him at his best \u2013 creative, fun-loving, imaginative, and knowledgeable. I, for one, am so appreciative that they\u2019ve stuck around. I know that Nigel is too.\nAnd I appreciate their parents just as much. Their mom, Cheryl, a very good friend and a regular commenter here, and I like to talk for a bit during the pick-up/drop-off times when we can. We check in about our lives \u2013 our kids, parents, pets, homes, jobs, plans. Last weekend we talked about the upcoming transition to high school, that we couldn\u2019t believe how big our older sons have so suddenly become. \u00a0I talked about how much better I feel about how Nigel\u2019s doing socially, how the combination of his medication and having a few good kids around him has helped immensely. I mentioned that I thought it really made an impression on most of the other kids that I had to pull him out to homeschool him for a year and a half, and when he came back, many of them realized \u2013 hey, this is someone who needs a little extra help, a little understanding. Maybe those kids even matured a bit. Cheryl told me that she had recently asked Nicholas how Nigel was doing at school, if anyone was bothering him. Nicholas told her that aside from a small group of kids that likes to target him, everyone else has been nice to him. He said that if anyone sees any of that group approach Nigel to bother him, someone else always goes over to intervene and help Nigel out. They\u2019ve got his back.\nI told Cheryl how glad I was to hear that, and if, in my choked-up state, I neglected to thank her, I\u2019m doing it now. Her boys, and a few others, have always been the core of Nigel\u2019s circle. A few months ago, when Nigel, by choice, started back at the middle school to finish eighth grade, I tried to form a Circle of Friends by requesting it at his IEP meeting, talking to the principal about it, and emailing information to those who could make it happen. Despite my efforts, the administration didn\u2019t pursue it. I felt so bad, felt that I should have done more, been a squeakier wheel.\nBut something did happen. When I wrote the letter to the school administrators, they talked to the kids who were involved in making a spectacle of Nigel. They \u2013 finally \u2013 told the kids a little about autism. And some of those kids felt remorse, and concern. And instead of continuing to have fun at his expense, many of them changed. They started being kind and helping him. I had read that this can be a positive result of Circle of Friends programs \u2013 that even kids who are not involved in the program hear about it and respond to the autistic students differently than they had before. It\u2019s a ripple effect that can sometimes reach the whole school. That is what I hoped for when I requested a Circle of Friends program at Nigel\u2019s school. And even though the program was never officially started, it seemed to happen on its own.\nLess than a year ago, Nigel sat in his room one night and drew ape faces in his yearbook on the photos of all the kids that had bullied him.\u00a0It made him feel better \u2013 his\u00a0own\u00a0type of art therapy. It was heartbreaking to see how many faces he drew over. This week, when he came home with his yearbook, it was filled with autographs and well-wishes for a good summer. It was filled with \u201cyou\u2019re cool\u201d and \u201csee you next year.\u201d These kids will be going with him to the local high school in September.\nI had wanted a Circle for Nigel, but in less than three months, I got something much bigger. And I have a feeling that we\u2019ll be having a lot more pizza-and-movie parties at our house next year.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/06/14/whats-bigger-than-a-circle/", "title": "What\u2019s Bigger Than a Circle?"},

If you haven\u2019t heard of him yet, you need to become familiar with him. And you\u2019ll be glad you did.\nDennis Debbaubt, parent of a young man with autism, has a background in investigative journalism and, as a professional investigator and law enforcement trainer, he has written or co-written over 30 articles and books since 1993, including Autism, Advocates and Law Enforcement Professionals: Recognizing and Reducing Risk Situations for People with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Dennis has also created several training videos which have been viewed\u00a0by hundreds of law enforcement and emergency services agencies throughout North America and the United Kingdom.\nDennis spends his time traveling and presenting seminars on Autism Risk and Safety. He uses a multi-media approach to train law enforcement, first responders, and emergency services personnel about autism and how it affects individuals they might come in contact with in the field. He teaches them about the sensory issues commonly associated with autism, fearfulness and communication issues that can drastically impact how a first responder can help an autistic individual, and what to do in various situations involving children and adults with autism. In addition to training law enforcement personnel and first responders, Dennis also presents seminars for parents, care providers, and educators, discussing many helpful safety tips in the home, at school, and in the community, and how to develop partnerships with law enforcement agencies and emergency services. Dennis promotes autism awareness and understanding in an area that is of the utmost importance \u2013 our children\u2019s safety.\nRecently, I was fortunate enough to attend one of Dennis Debbaubt\u2019s Autism Risk & Safety seminars. I came home with pages of notes and helpful materials that I couldn\u2019t wait to share with all of you. More importantly, I came home with the knowledge that we parents have the most influence in how safe our children are \u2013 and how proactive we are in our risk management. We parents don\u2019t have all the answers about autism. But you have more answers than anybody else about your child. No one knows more about your child than you do, so share that knowledge with those that need to know. Dennis Debbaubt\u2019s message is to be proactive \u2013 don\u2019t leave it up to anyone else. We have to do this for the safety of our children, no matter how old they are.\nOver the next week, I\u2019ll be posting segments from the seminar about what you can do at home for autism safety and risk prevention, what you can do in your community, and provide a list of essential resources. Check back soon for my next post on things you can do at home and school to protect your child with autism. We cannot eliminate risk, but we can manage it. \n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismriskmanagement.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Autism-Advocates-Law-Enforcement-Professionals/dp/1853029807/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1245378356&sr=1-1", "http://www.autismriskmanagement.com/autism_presentations.cfm", "http://www.autismriskmanagement.com/autism_presentations.cfm"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/06/18/autism-safety-risk-management-part-1/", "title": "Autism Safety & Risk Management, Part 1"},
{"date": "June 21, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tDennis Debbaubt began his Autism Risk & Safety Management Seminar with a powerful analogy: How many people wore their seatbelts on the way to this seminar? How many people just put it on without even thinking about it? We don\u2019t think about the fact that we might get in an accident \u2013 we just put it on because it\u2019s part of our daily safety routine, like locking doors and looking both ways. We didn\u2019t arrive at the seminar and say, \u201cWell, that was a waste of time, putting on my seatbelt. I didn\u2019t even get in an accident!\u201d And we\u2019re still going to wear our seatbelts the next time we get in the car. Likewise, managing risk for our children is part of our daily safety routine. We don\u2019t have incidents occurring every day, but we still need to have those risk management efforts in place. And in many cases, there is more that we can be doing, even in our own home.\nOne of the biggest risks for people with autism is wandering, whether they\u2019re at home or they\u2019re away from home. I\u2019ve experienced this with my own son over the years, and wish that I\u2019d had more knowledge of the things I could have done to prepare for such a situation before it occurred. I still would have panicked all the times it happened, but at least I would have had more of a plan in place. The following are some tips to manage wandering and also address in-home safety issues:\n\nSecure the home. As I discovered, resourceful autistic preschoolers can quickly move a chair over to doors with locks strategically placed \u201cout of their reach.\u201d Thus, I\u00a0learned to keep all chairs away from the vicinity of the door, and to move the locks to the very top of the door. Dennis also recommends that when you have to put extra locks on your exterior doors to make sure to upgrade your smoke and\u00a0carbon monoxide\u00a0alarms. Put a bell or alarm system on the doors, or \u2013 ideally \u2013 have a professional locksmith or burglar alarm company install a system. Use technology to your advantage. Have stickers put on all windows near exterior doors alerting first responders that there is an individual with autism in the house. (See ASA\u2019s Safe & Sound program for stickers and more tips.)\nUse social stories, books, or videos to teach ASD children about safety issues and being able to respond to police and emergency services personnel. This will be most helpful in situations when you (the parent) might be incapacitated, such as a car accident, or in a fire, so that your child will not hide or run from rescuers.\nOf course, secure poisonous chemicals, cleaners, matches and lighters, tools, knives, and weapons in locked cabinets. Make sure the ASD individual does not have access to the key!\nAsk your local 911 call center to \u201cred flag\u201d information about your child in their database before you need to call them in an emergency. That way, if and when you call during an emergency, the 911 dispatcher can alert the first responders with the information before they arrive. Providing them with this information before an incident occurs will yield better responses.\nPrepare an Autism Emergency Information\u00a0Form and make copies to keep on the refrigerator, near the phone, in your purse and the glove box of your car, and to give to other family members, teachers, friends, trusted neighbors, and caregivers.\nConsider ID options. Even verbal individuals may have difficulty expressing themselves in stressful situations and would benefit from some type of identification. Options include a MedicAlert bracelet or necklace, a shoe tag, laminated cards sewn into jackets or on belt loops or zipper pulls, and non-permanent tattoos that bear ID information (tattooswithapurpose.com).\nCheck if there is a Project Lifesaver\u00a0program near you.\u00a0 If not, use a personal GPS tracking device, such as those featured at Brickhouse Security (be sure to scroll down to read the FAQs). Again, use technology to your advantage: LoJack SafetyNet features a tracking bracelet that utilizes radio frequency technology and has a 6-month battery life.\nKeep a record that notes all the safety precautions you make. You may need to prove to authorities that you are not a neglectful parent, especially if your child is a wanderer. Some will assume that this is because the child is unsupervised for long periods of time and will tell you that you need to \u201ckeep an eye on\u201d your child or \u201cteach them not to wander off.\u201d We parents of ASD children are some of the most vigilant parents around, but those who don\u2019t know us (or our children) tend to make assumptions, and unfortunately we hear those types of comments all too often.\n\nIn the next post, I\u2019ll discuss what I learned from the seminar about what you can do in your community to help manage risk and keep your child safe.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismriskmanagement.com/", "http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer?pagename=research_safeandsound", "http://www.mypreciouskid.com/safety-video.html", "http://www.autismriskmanagement.com/documents/autism_emergency_contact_form.pdf", "http://www.medicalert.org/asa/", "http://www.mypreciouskid.com/child-autism-safety.html", "http://tattooswithapurpose.com/", "http://www.projectlifesaver.org/", "http://www.brickhousesecurity.com/about-child-locators-gps-tracking.html", "https://www.safetynetbylojack.com/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/06/21/autism-safety-risk-management-part-2/", "title": "Autism Safety & Risk Management, Part 2"},
{"date": "June 25, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tDuring Dennis Debbaubt\u2019s seminars for training law enforcement and emergency services personnel, the first thing he tells them about encountering an ASD individual in the field is to expect the unexpected. He teaches them about the various behaviors they might see, the communication difficulties they might encounter, and the best ways they might handle those situations. He discusses the sensory issues and anxieties that ASD individuals can have. He stresses that each ASD individual is exactly that \u2013 an individual. They are similar in some ways but by no means all alike.\nAnd so, since we parents know how true that is, it\u2019s up to us to use the tools that we know will help our individual children best. We have many resources available to us, but they do no good if we do not utilize them to prepare for emergency situations, not just react to them. With that in mind, I would like to remind you of the links for resources listed in Autism Safety & Risk Mangement, Part 2, including ASA\u2019s Safe & Sound program, safety videos, MedicAlert bracelets, shoe tags, non-permanent tattoos, Project Lifesaver, and personal GPS tracking systems. In my previous post, I mentioned disclosure with neighbors, writing \u201csocial safety\u201d teaching into your child\u2019s IEP, and carrying a handout card. I discovered an excellent source for purchasing handout cards: AutismCards.com. They have numerous designs with different content, so you can look around and choose what would be most effective for your child. Most important, don\u2019t forget to fill out and make copies of the Autism Emergency Information Form. All of these tools are valuable resources; we just need to decide what works best for our children and follow through with our risk and safety management.\nLast on the list of resources \u2013 but certainly not least \u2013 is Dennis. Dennis Debbaubt\u2019s seminars are invaluable for helping your local law enforcement and emergency services personnel learn about autism and how to interact with your ASD child. Unfortunately, in many cases Dennis is asked to come and give his presentations as a result of something that went wrong, such as a wandering autistic teen being tasered by police, or a child who wanders away from school and drowns. And then Dennis is summoned to present his special training seminars \u2013 one specifically designed for law enforcement personnel and first responders, and the other for parents, teachers, and caregivers. But we shouldn\u2019t wait until something happens. For our children\u2019s safety and our own peace of mind,\u00a0we need to be proactive.\nSo \u2013 how do you get Dennis, you ask? Two of the best approaches you could take would be to a) contact your state or local chapter of the Autism Society of America, or b) to contact your local Education Service District. You can also see if the two agencies would be willing to split the cost to host Dennis. However you get him, he\u2019s worth it. I admire Dennis so much for what he does, and I feel fortunate to have met him and learned from him. I can\u2019t tell you how glad I am that he presented his seminars in my area. It is such a relief to know that those in my community who are out there safeguarding my son now have the tools to help him and understand him better. And I\u2019m sure that they\u2019re just as glad to have that knowledge. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismcards.com/", "http://www.autismriskmanagement.com/documents/autism_emergency_contact_form.pdf", "http://www.autismriskmanagement.com/autism_presentations.cfm", "http://209.200.89.252/search_site/chapter_map.cfm"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/06/25/autism-safety-risk-management-part-4/", "title": "Autism Safety & Risk Management, Part 4"},
{"date": "June 23, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tOne of the stats that really stood out to me from Dennis Debbaubt\u2019s Autism Risk & Safety Management Seminar that I attended is the fact that ASD people, throughout their lifetimes, have up to seven times more contact with law enforcement than the general population. Add to that figure the fact that there is a deficit of training for interactions with ASD people, and we have a gap that needs to be filled. Dennis Debbaubt\u2019s training seminars help to fill that gap, but what\u2019s equally important is parents\u2019 willingness to disclose information about their child. We all value our privacy \u2013 and need it to protect our children. But if you want to upgrade safety, Dennis points out, you have to give up a little privacy.\nThe first thing you can do in your community to help manage risk is to reach out and get to know your neighbors. It is undeniable that the behaviors and characteristics of autism have the potential to attract attention from the public. By disclosing to your neighbors the fact that your child\u00a0has autism, you will help avoid problems down the road. Talking with your neighbors about your child will tell them that you are approachable and responsible. Your neighbors will know the reason for any unusual behaviors they might see, and they can notify you first if they see your child taking off clothes outside (Nigel has done this), wandering (this too), or destroying property (um, no comment). Knowing your neighbors can also lead to better social interactions for your ASD child, especially when they are older and\u00a0people\u00a0would expect them\u00a0to be more socially adept. If your neighbors know about your child\u2019s autism, they will usually be more understanding. [Note: Some parents fear that this disclosure would increase their child\u2019s risk for abduction or sexual abuse. Dennis Debbaubt has researched this topic, and for parents who are concerned, he recommends reading Ken Lanning\u2019s booklet, Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis, which provides characteristics of pedophiles, among other investigative strategies. It was written as a tool for law enforcement officers and child-protection professionals, but it has helpful information for parents who want to know.]\nThe next thing you can do in your community is to have risk and safety concerns written into your child\u2019s IEP, if you have not already. At your IEP meeting, discuss with the teachers and therapists what the de-escalation plan is for your child, and what they should do if your child is not able to de-escalate. This should be a mandatory part of all IEPs, so that we don\u2019t continue to read news stories about ASD children and teens being arrested and handcuffed because of a sensory meltdown. \u00a0Teachers, aides, and therapists are our children\u2019s primary caregivers when they\u2019re at school \u2013 they need plans in place to help care for your individual child the best way possible, especially in difficult situations. Schools can also plan educational opportunities for children to learn to recognize and be comfortable with law enforcement and emergency services personnel out in the community, which will help in an emergency situation. These field trips will also help your local law enforcement and emergency services personnel to become familiar with the ASD children in\u00a0your community and how best to communicate with them and help them.\nAnother area of concern that can be addressed at school and written into the IEP is \u201csocial safety\u201d teaching. Social stories can be used to teach children and teens about important things like public restroom \u201cetiquette\u201d for their safety, and learning appropriate behavior for stores, hospitals, airports, etc. Equally important is being able to recognize \u201cfalse friends,\u201d people who will target both verbal and nonverbal ASD individuals because they are vulnerable. Our ASD kids can be tricked into doing inappropriate or unlawful things without their understanding, and when law enforcement arrives on the scene, the ASD individual is left holding the bag. As the parent of a verbal autistic 14-year-old, this is one of my greatest concerns. My son is starting to want to be independent, but he doesn\u2019t have the ability to know when people are using him or to avoid questionable situations. Additionally, if he is walking down the street and sees a broken window or some used fireworks or a dead animal or anything unusual that catches his eye, he will stop to investigate for a lengthy time period, and could easily be blamed for whatever occurred, especially since he avoids eye contact when speaking to people and can \u201cact out\u201d when nervous or under stress, making himself look suspicious or like he\u2019s on drugs.\nThat brings us to the final topic for things you can do in your community for your child\u2019s safety. We can\u2019t expect police to field-diagnose a person with autism, so we need to have a way to notify them. Dennis recommends that either you, or your semi-independent older child/teen, carry a handout card. The handout card should be typed, approximately the size of a business card, and able to be copied and laminated. It should tell the officers that they are interacting with a person with autism and indicate that the person (your child) will be anxious in new situations with new people, will avoid eye contact, may or may not be able to speak, needs to hear calm, direct language avoiding slang and sarcasm, needs extra time to answer questions and may repeat what is said to them, may rock, pace, or engage in self-stimulatory behavior, \u00a0may make inappropriate comments or gestures, may give a false confession, and may display extreme distress such as yelling, crying, or physical agitation. It\u2019s also important to have the handout card mention sensory issues\u00a0with sound, lights, or touch, or a fear of dogs. It should also suggest removing your child from areas that may aggravate sensory issues and escalate behavior. The card should note if your child is prone to seizures and what the officer should do if one occurs. Most importantly, the card should list contact information for parents, caregivers, therapists, or doctors. If your child or teen is at a point where they are out in the community independently, even for a short time, carrying a handout card is a must. Teach them not to run from police officers, to tell the officer that they have autism or Asperger\u2019s, and to say that they have a medical card to give to the officer, but to wait until the officer tells them it\u2019s okay to get the card before they reach for it.\nLearning about handout cards really helped to put my mind at ease with my son being alone in the community more often as he nears adulthood. I\u2019ll always worry \u2013 that\u2019s a given \u2013 but at least I know that there\u2019s a tool in place that can help him in certain situations. Dennis suggests that handout cards can also be helpful for nonverbal individuals when combined with an ID bracelet. These are simple, effective tools for helping to keep our ASD children safe in our community. Using these tools, along with being willing to disclose information to our neighbors and working with the schools to promote safety awareness, will help to manage risk and give us a little more peace of mind.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismriskmanagement.com/", "http://missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/ResourceServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&PageId=469"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/06/23/autism-safety-risk-management-part-3/", "title": "Autism Safety & Risk Management, Part 3"},

But they really want to see it, and so it\u2019s my treat to them. In five minutes we\u2019ll be going to see X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and\u00a0I\u2019ll try to suffer through the shirtless Hugh Jackman scenes. Take one for the team, you know?\u00a0So unfortunately I don\u2019t have time to write the Mother\u2019s Day post I\u2019d hoped to write, the one about how much all the moms I know inspire me, how glad I am to know them, and how much they mean to me. All of them \u2013 from my mom, to my boss, to my co-workers, to my friends, to my readers, and to my sister, who\u2019s been a mom for a month. Thanks for being there, for showing me the way, for encouraging me, and for just being your wonderful selves. I hope you\u2019ll accept this re-posting of the Mother\u2019s Day post I wrote last year, because I\u2019m on my way out the door to spend some quality time with Hugh Jackman my boys. Happy Mother\u2019s Day to all of you!\nFourteen years ago I celebrated my first Mother\u2019s Day as a mother-to-be. My then-husband gave me a card saying what a wonderful mom he knew I\u2019d be, and my own mom gave me a card with the same sentiment. I think back to the person I was then, not having any idea of the depth of emotion I would experience because of the little person in my belly and the one who would come after him.\nBeing a mother, autism or no autism, has taught me more about life than anything else I\u2019ve experienced. Just the knowledge that it\u2019s my job, my responsibility, to give these guys all the tools they need to lead a successful, happy life is enough to blow my mind. There are plenty of articles and books out there about how to raise good kids, how to be a better parent, but nothing can really prepare you. You have to jump in with both feet and just trust that you\u2019ll be okay. That you\u2019re going to make a few mistakes, and you\u2019ll run into a few rough spots, but you\u2019ll handle\u00a0them. You\u2019ll get through it\u00a0and keep going.\nAs we moms know, being a mother isn\u2019t always easy but it\u2019s always worth it. We live for the days when we take our kids\u00a0somewhere that they thought would be boring, and then not only can we tell that they really like it (as we knew they would), but they come up to us and hug us and say, \u201cI really like this place, Mom. Thanks for taking me.\u201d (That was Aidan at a museum last weekend.) And we live for the days when our children receive special awards or when, for the first time, they apologize for their behavior on their own instead of us having to do it (that was Nigel recently). We savor the triumphs, be they large or small, and think We\u2019re getting there. I must be doing something right.\nAnd the day will come when they are on their own. Even those of us with differently-abled kids will go through this change, on some level. I often wonder how I will feel when that time comes. How hard will it be to let go? It\u2019s hard enough for me to let them ride their bikes to the grocery store! But I take comfort in the idea that it will happen little by little, just like how Nigel learned to talk, how he\u2019s learning to be responsible for himself. I also take comfort in knowing that I will always be their mom. Nothing will change that.\nSo, here\u2019s to all the good moms, like my own (love you, Mom!), and my friends who keep me sane. We need all the support we can get, in all the mothering stages of our lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.x-menorigins.com/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/05/09/happy-mothers-day/", "title": "Happy Mother\u2019s Day!"},
{"date": "May 10, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nWhen Nigel was very little, about two years old, he had a cute little fleece jacket with a \u201cvarsity\u201d number on it. It also had a hood on it, and we noticed that he preferred to have the hood up whenever we left the house. When I learned that he had autism and that most of his meltdowns were sensory-related, I came to realize that the hood on his jacket helped to muffle\u00a0many sounds that he was unable to filter. So as he got bigger, I bought him new fleece jackets with snug-fitting hoods. The one in the photo above is probably his third such jacket, and he was five years old.\nHe continued to wear his hooded jacket \u2013 always with the hood up \u2013 when he was in elementary school. The teachers allowed him to, although they encouraged him to remove it while he was in class. It didn\u2019t really matter to me that he had the hood up inside; if it helped to muffle sounds that bothered him, then I felt he should be allowed to have it up. What I didn\u2019t realize was that the elementary teachers were trying to prepare him for middle school.\nAt Nigel\u2019s middle school, it is against school policy for any student to have their hood up or wear a hat on school grounds. And the noisy halls of that school is where a sound-muffler would be most needed. Whenever I go to pick him up from school, I sit in the foyer near the office to wait for him, and as soon as the bell rings and students begin pouring into the halls, the din is at such an intense level that I have no idea how Nigel manages it. I have suggested to him that he wear ear plugs or headphones in the halls, but he nixes that idea with his \u201cI want to be like everybody else\u201d refrain.\nSo he abides by the school rule and, every morning when I drop him off, as soon as he steps onto the school grounds, he sheds his hood and bravely walks into the building. I always like to look in my rear view mirror as I drive away, checking to see if anyone follows him to bother him. I used to see kids walk behind him and mimic him or flick him in the back of his neck to get a reaction out of him. He tells me that no one bothers him anymore, but I\u2019m never sure because he has withheld information before because he doesn\u2019t want me to worry. So I watch.\nOne day last week, I dropped him off and he got out of the car with his hood up, because he likes to wear it when we leave the house in the morning. As usual, he walked toward the entrance, and as soon as he was officially on school grounds, he slipped off his hood and continued on into the building. As I pulled away, I noticed three boys standing off to the side, watching him. They pointed at him and laughed. And then, as I slowly drove by them, one of them actually had the gall to look at my face while he was still laughing. He saw which car Nigel got out of, day after day. He knew damn well who he was looking at. And so, with adrenaline pumping through my veins and a lump stuck in my throat, I glared at him. I glared at that boy who dared to laugh at someone just because he wears a hood every morning, just because he does things a little differently.\nAnd I drove to work with sobs catching in my throat because I realized that no matter what I do, no matter how many Circles of Friends I try to start, no matter how much I write about autism, no matter how much advocacy I do, there will always be people who will laugh at my son and his different ways. This is one of the things I grieve for \u2013 knowing that ignorant people won\u2019t give my son the respect and dignity he deserves; they\u2019ll laugh, or worse \u2013 harass him. And it burns me. I can be Zen-like about receiving the wrong school book, but not this. This is hurtful. And there is nothing I can do about it, nothing more than what I already do. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is one of the hard things about being the parent of a special needs child. No one wants their child, typical or not, to be laughed at. But we parents of special needs children deal with it on a regular basis. We do all we can to stop it, but it still happens. And we know it will continue to. I guess we just\u00a0need to have the\u00a0strength to do all we can \u2013 and the grace to realize that that\u2019s all we can do. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not there yet. It still makes me angry and sad. And I think it always will.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/05/10/the-hood/", "title": "The Hood"},
{"date": "May 12, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nAs most moms do, I have a delightful collection of handmade gifts from my children, dating from pre-school Christmas decorations to middle school woodshop creations. I have hand-painted ceramic plates (one with a lion and one with a tiger), glazed foot and hand print castings, hand-shaped terra cotta pots, various paintings and drawings, a wooden whale key holder, a miniature hand-woven scarf (because full-size would have taken too long, I was told), juice-can-lid magnets, a beaded caterpillar, a popsicle stick picture frame (who doesn\u2019t have one of those?), and a Lego heart. And even though I assure my kids that I still like the handmade gifts the best, in recent years they often like to have the experience of picking out a gift for me at the store and buying it with their allowance.\nFor Christmas this past year, I made it easy for them and requested candles. Both of them had done many trial runs through check stands before, so they knew the drill, but this was their first time completely unassisted. I told them what part of the store I would be in and told them to come and find me after they had made their purchase. Success! They selected some lovely candles to wrap up for me and even had some money left over for some candy for themselves (not part of the instructions, but, oh well).\nFor Mother\u2019s Day, I decided to make it a little more challenging and made an open request with some suggestions from which they could choose. I wanted them to have some experience in choosing gifts not just for me, but for anyone in their lives as they get older. \u201cWhen you get a gift for someone, you need to think about things that the person likes and let that influence your choice,\u201d I told them. I then reminded them of some things I like: candles, little bamboo plants, Snickers, kettle corn, SoBe Black & Blue Berry Brew \u00a0\u2013 perfect little treats for Mother\u2019s Day. We got to the store and I reminded them where things were, told them to have the gifts double-bagged so I wouldn\u2019t see what they\u2019d bought, and then went to my designated waiting spot. The boys got separated and we ended up looking for Nigel for ten minutes, but that\u2019s less time than it usually takes to find him! Not too bad for the second buying-gifts-alone venture. I couldn\u2019t wait until Sunday to see what they had picked out for me!\nAs usual, they really surprised me. They both eschewed the edible (or burnable) suggestions and went for something with permanence. Aidan bought a pretty miniature rose plant that\u2019s actually supposed to be planted in the ground. \u201cThat way Sheba won\u2019t get it,\u201d he said, reminding me of our indoor cat who has destroyed all of my houseplants. A very wise gift, indeed.\nAnd Nigel? Nigel went for something completely different, remembering something I like that I hadn\u2019t mentioned on the way to the store \u2013 tigers. I have photos or paintings of tigers in every room of the house (and one on my arm). Nigel bought a tiger figurine to put on my desk. But what he said as he gave it to me makes it even more meaningful: I got you this tiger to honor your independent spirit. How does an autistic teen see a personality trait like that in someone and link it to their favorite animal? Sometimes he really astounds me with what he is capable of.\nI thanked him profusely for his thoughtful \u2013 and insightful \u2013 gift. He really knows his mom! And you know what? I like these store-bought gifts just as much as the handmade ones. There\u2019s something to be said for a truly thoughtful gift, no matter if you make it or buy it.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/05/12/know-thy-mother/", "title": "Know Thy Mother"},
{"date": "May 14, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tI have a small scar on my forehead, and every time I look in the mirror and see it, I am reminded of Nigel\u2019s long road to understanding the word \u201csorry.\u201d Sorry is one of those vague words, like \u201cthanks\u201d or \u201cplease.\u201d It\u2019s not a concrete noun or verb, nor the type of adjective that tells something\u2019s size or color. It is impossible for an autistic child to visualize. For a long time, Nigel did not understand the word.\nWhen he was six years old, we had some friends and their two children over for a barbeque,\u00a0\u00a0and Nigel was enjoying interacting with the kids (he\u00a0has always been social, in spite of the autism). His verbal abilities were quite limited then. They were playing a chasing game, running through the house, and their little boy was chasing Nigel, who was laughing. Nigel ran into his room and slammed the door behind him, catching the other little boy\u2019s fingers in the door. I knew he didn\u2019t mean to, but the little boy was hurt, and I wanted Nigel to apologize. While the other mother was soaking her son\u2019s fingers in a bowl of ice water, I kept telling Nigel that he needed to say that he was sorry. He kept saying \u201cNo sorry, no sorry\u201d over and over again. So I took him in his room and tried again to explain it to him, and again he said \u201cNo sorry, no sorry.\u201d I spanked him. It pains me to admit that I\u2019ve done and said things to my son that I regret, that I hate myself for doing, in the days before I understood how the autism was affecting him. I told him again, in a horrible voice, \u201cYou need to say sorry!\u201d and again he persisted with his \u201cno sorry\u201d mantra. I just didn\u2019t get it. To this day I feel terrible for not understanding him. His verbal skills were so limited then that perhaps he was actually trying to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d but it came out \u201cno sorry.\u201d And I wish that I\u2019d had the insight to know that then, and to react differently, instead of punishing him for his inability to say something properly.\nJust one year later, Nigel and I were out in the backyard playing. He tickled me or something, and I came after him with a playful, \u201cI\u2019m gonna get ya!\u201d I chased him through the side yard, and Nigel, laughing, ran through the wooden gateway, slamming the gate behind him. He slammed it just as I ran into it, and the force of the impact split the skin on my forehead. I saw stars and almost collapsed. I slowly opened the gate and stood there, trying to regain my composure. Nigel came back, took one look at me, and said, \u201cSorry! Sorry! Sorry, Mom!\u201d I hugged him and told him that I was okay.\n\u201cSorry\u201d is now a regular part of Nigel\u2019s vocabulary, although he rarely puts \u201cI\u2019m\u201d in front of it. Usually he will say, \u201cSorry about that\u201d or \u201cSorry I did that\u201d or \u201cSorry I forgot to do that.\u201d If he didn\u2019t understand its meaning before, he does now, and he readily apologizes for his mistakes. But maybe that\u2019s also because he\u2019s frequently heard it from me.\nYou see, sorry is a regular part of my vocabulary, too. Even though I accepted the autism diagnosis from the beginning, I didn\u2019t understand all the ways it affected Nigel \u2013 the pervasive nature of it \u2013 for many years. I\u2019m still learning. I still get frustrated with him. I understand so much more now, but I\u2019m ashamed of my reactions before I understood, when I expected him to do or say things that he wasn\u2019t able to. And so I\u2019ve been saying sorry quite a bit over the years. Fortunately, Nigel\u2019s not the only one who learns things. His mom does too.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/05/14/the-first-sorry/", "title": "The First Sorry"},
{"date": "April 1, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nI\u2019ve had several inquiries about how Aidan is doing, and the short answer is this: He is not in pain, but we still don\u2019t have any answers.\nIn the past four weeks, Aidan has given about nine vials of blood and at least as many stool samples, which is not fun for either of us. He\u2019s had his stomach x-rayed and endured two rectal exams. And today, we went through a lengthy radiological\u00a0scan.\nI\u2019m sure many of you know what it\u2019s like to sit next to your child in a hospital bed, or on a gurney, holding his hand and stroking his head as you tell him to relax and try to hold still while this thing scans him for an hour and that you\u2019re right here and it\u2019s going to be okay. And you read to him and talk to him and periodically reach over to apply pressure to the injection site because he said that makes it feel better. And there\u2019s a huge machine hovering over his little, fragile\u00a0body, and just as you think, God, I hope that thing is secure, your son says, \u201cMom?\u00a0 What if this thing falls on me?\u201d And you tell him, \u201cHoney, if that happened, it would make a creaking noise and start to bend first, and in that instant I would grab you, \u2018cause I\u2019m right here, and I would pull you out of the way before it fell on you. I promise you.\u201d Because I am your mom. And it kills me to not know what\u2019s wrong. As I watched on the screen while the diagnostic chemical moved its way through his digestive system, I hoped that it wasn\u2019t doing more harm as we tried to rule out yet another potential cause of his internal bleeding, which has lessened considerably but is still present. A slow bleed, the doctors called it.\nThey have ruled out E. coli and salmonella and internal hemorrhoids and ulcers. Next month is a visit to the gastroenterologist for a sigmoidoscopy. So not fun. And part of me thinks that Aidan\u2019s limited eating is at least a contributing factor, so I have also set up an appointment with a counselor to address that issue. One way or another, we will figure this out.\nAnd the other part of Double Duty? The Nigel-back-at-regular-school variable? Aside from the initial unsupervised-lunch-time spectacle, things seem to be going well. So far so good, I\u2019m happy to report. At this point, the less damage control needed, the better.

I encouraged Nigel to participate in a Habitat for Humanity walk last year, he does Scouting for Food with Boy Scouts, and he and Aidan often go with me to donate to local charities. In that vein, promoting autism awareness comes naturally to me.\nMy good friend and fellow blogger, Jenn at Devin\u2019s Journey, wrote a few days ago about today being World Autism Awareness Day. I love the thought of that, seeing as autism knows no political borders. Not only did Jenn remind us of the day, she asked what we were doing for it. Aside from my ongoing campaign to eradicate the r-word from my workplace, I thought of more that I could do.\nFirst of all, I\u2019m doing something close to home, because there is still so much that needs to be accomplished right in our own backyard. So today I\u2019m going to email the principal at Nigel\u2019s school and restart my wheel-squeaking about implementing a Circle of Friends program there. I had sent the principal a link to the ABC News autism page, which features a video that discusses ASD and bullying, and how beneficial the Circle of Friends-type of program has been for the school in the video. I sent the link in an email almost three weeks ago and haven\u2019t heard back yet, so it\u2019s time for some serious squeaking.\nI also think that today is the perfect occasion to announce my plans for this summer. I have posted previously about Knowledge for People, a non-profit dedicated to autism education and outreach for developing countries. In July, they are going to Nepal, and I am thrilled to be joining them (!) as a parent liaison and sensory issues presenter.

I am so excited to be doing this! Not only to have the opportunity to go to Nepal, but to have the opportunity to help others understand autism and learn how they can help their children in a place where knowledge and resources are so limited. With all the hurdles we face here in the US with getting services for our children, at least the services exist, at least people have heard of autism. At least we can do something for our kids. All parents \u2013 everywhere \u2013 should be so fortunate.\nIt\u2019s a done deal, folks. I\u2019ve got my tickets, my backpack, and my spirit of adventure.

{"date": "May 19, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tYou would think that your constantly-eating teenage son would come running when he hears the words, \u201cDinner\u2019s ready!\u201d Especially since you have resigned yourself to only prepare the foods that he will eat because he is thin and needs all the food he can get. So he doesn\u2019t have to worry about coming to the table and seeing something he might not like. Why then, when you say, \u201cDinner\u2019s ready!\u201d does he growl in response, \u201cThat fast?!\u201d This is after the five-or-ten-minute transitional warning that you have learned to always give him. You always say, \u201cDinner\u2019s in five [or ten] minutes!\u201d and make sure that he hears you, so that he can prepare himself mentally for the transition and finish up what he\u2019s doing. Yet every day, without fail, he will sneer, \u201cThat fast?!\u201d when you tell him that dinner is ready, even though he has had his advance notice.\nAnd every day, you model a more appropriate response for him. \u201cOkay, Mom\u201d or \u201cBe right there!\u201d You tell him that he should respond more politely to someone who prepares a meal for him. But somehow the appropriate responses don\u2019t seem to register. He doesn\u2019t get it. For years now, he has said, \u201cThat fast?!\u201d in a negative tone, and it just seems to be a habit for him. And you worry about him doing that at any friend\u2019s house where he might actually be invited to have dinner. You worry that in the \u201cpoliteness vs. difficulty with transitions\u201d fight, politeness will always lose.\nBut, much to your surprise, the day will come when you will say, \u201cDinner\u2019s ready!\u201d at his bedroom door, and he, seated at his computer desk, will politely say, \u201cOne moment, please.\u201d And you will just about fall over dead from the shock. And when you recover, you will think that he really must be up to something in there to be that polite. So you poke your head in and check, and he\u2019s not doing anything out of the ordinary. So you praise him for being polite, but you don\u2019t want to overdo it or that will exasperate him and then he will never be polite again. And you can\u2019t help but wonder if this is just a one-time deal, if he had by chance recently watched a movie that featured that line when a character announced that a meal was being served and the scene was still fresh in his mind.\nAnd the next day when you tell him that dinner\u2019s ready, he says nicely, \u201cOkay, Mom.\u201d And you thank him and then just stand there in the hallway and think, Wow! He\u2019s getting it! And the next day when you tell him he says, \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d And you start to hyperventilate because he\u2019s been polite three days in a row. And the fourth day, you tell him when dinner\u2019s ready, and he growls at you, and you realize that you had forgotten the 5-10 minute \u201cwarning.\u201d So at least now you know that your transitional cue really helped, even though all this time it appeared to not make a difference. The next day, you remember the \u201cwarning,\u201d and you tell him that dinner will be ready in five minutes. And he helps.To set. The table.

{"date": "May 17, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nEleven and a half years ago, I attended my first special education meeting for my son, when he was three years old. It was called an IFSP \u2013 Individualized Family Service Plan \u2013 the precursor to his IEPs. Unfortunately, back then I didn\u2019t think to bring snacks, but I did bring a tape recorder, thinking, for whatever reason, that I should.\nI found the old tape and listened to it recently. It was cathartic, of course, knowing how far Nigel has come since then, but it was also very strange to hear my voice from that long ago \u2013 expressing my concerns, etc. \u2013 when I was so new to the realm of special needs parenting. I sounded so calm and sure of myself, even though I felt completely overwhelmed, had so many questions, and didn\u2019t know the jargon. It was good to hear the confidence in my voice back then, not realizing that it had been there. I surprise myself sometimes.\nAnd Nigel, of course, surprises me too. Last week, he attended his first special education meeting for himself. It was not an official IEP \u2013 just a placement meeting for next year \u2013 so we did not go over goals or anything like that. Nigel was reluctant to go at first, and for a while I thought that I\u2019d have to go without him. I wanted him to go because this short meeting would prepare him for future meetings, the more intensive ones where we would discuss his goals and his progress toward them. I want him to be an active part of these meetings, to usher him into the realm of self-advocacy. To teach him how to diplomatically make his needs known to others. I tried to convey this to him in terms that he could understand, but in the end, what motivated him to go was the fact that we would need to use a map of his new high school to find the room where the meeting was being held. He has always liked maps, and immediately plotted our route.\nDue to an inaccuracy in the drawing of the map, we ended up in a hallway right outside what was probably the band room, just as a loud burst of instruments blared. Nigel, eyes wide, covered his ears and yelled, \u201cBack! We must go back!\u201d As soon as we re-entered the previous hallway we\u2019d been in, I said, \u201cWell, now you know to avoid that hallway.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, breathless but okay.\nWe tried a different route and found our way to the library, where the meeting was being held. Nigel saw the Regional Autism Consultant, who has worked with him since the IFSP days, and he seemed to relax. We sat at a table and waited for the rest of the attendees. I was emotional to have Nigel there with me for the first time, and tried not to dwell on the magnitude of it lest I lose my composure. Soon the others arrived \u2013 Nigel\u2019s speech and social skills therapist, the high school\u2019s special education coordinator, and one of his teachers for next year (the rest of his teachers will meet the week before school starts for the official IEP).\nI no longer record the meetings; in fact, I think that first one was the only one I did. But I\u2019m glad I did so that I could listen to it years later. It was in the forefront of my mind as I watched Nigel sit in his first meeting. And I am quite proud to say that it went very well. The sped coordinator talked with him as an equal, asking him what classroom accommodations he felt he would need, assured him that all sped students get first choice for electives, and told him that he would be checking in with her every day to make sure that things are going okay and that she would\u00a0help him if he needs any help. His first week, he will have someone help him get to class, and he will never, she said, have to eat lunch alone. Trying not to cry, I thanked her. Nigel, although making no eye contact and constantly scratching his head because he had neglected to take a shower when he was supposed to, answered everyone\u2019s questions, talked about his interests appropriately, and even made a joke. At the end of the meeting, when asked what he thought of\u00a0attending that high school, he responded, \u201cIf this library is well-stocked with H.G. Wells and Jules Verne books, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Everyone laughed a genuine laugh, and I stole a glance at Nigel. I could have sworn I saw a little self-satisfied smirk on his face.

And I want to give a big hug to the person who typed it in.\n\nhow to get to know an autistic teen\n\nWow! Doesn\u2019t that renew your faith in humanity? Whoever you are, can we clone you? If more people wanted to get to know autistic teens, if more people realized that they have feelings and interests and personalities worth knowing and cared enough to find out how to achieve that, our kids would be a lot happier and so would we. And more people\u2019s lives would be enhanced by knowing them. Because, verbal or not, they have a lot to offer.\nSo, how do you get to know an autistic teen? Your approach should depend somewhat on the teen\u2019s communication ability. If you\u2019re wanting to get to know a non-verbal autistic teen, your best bet is to contact the parents or caregiver first to find out what you can about the teen: likes, dislikes, things that might upset them. They might communicate with PECS or writing, or some other method. The important thing to remember is that, regardless of how they communicate, their receptive communication is usually much greater than their expressive, and autistic teens understand a lot more than people realize.\nThe following is a list of guidelines for getting to know an autistic teen:\n\nFind out their interests, which may or may not include computers, Lego, science, history, movies, superheroes, movies about superheroes, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, etc. (Fellow parents, feel free to add to this list of interests in the comments!)\nDon\u2019t expect eye contact, handshakes, or hugs. At least not for a long time, in most cases.\nDon\u2019t use figures of speech, which tend to be confusing for literal-minded autistic teens.\nDo expect many verbal autistic teens to speak in a monotone voice \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t interested or are being rude. This type of voice is just a common trait of autistic teens.\nDon\u2019t expect terms of politeness. Autistic teens often forget to say thank you when you give them something, whether it\u2019s a compliment or a gift or a piece of gum. If you ask \u201cHow are you?\u201d they might say \u201cFine\u201d but not reciprocate by asking the same of you. Conversational niceties are difficult for autistic teens to remember because most do not understand the purpose. Many try to remember to say them anyway.\nDo be patient. Sometimes it takes a moment for the autistic teen to formulate a response.\nDon\u2019t expect them to talk for long periods of time in a conversational manner. You know how when someone trips a little, a friend might jokingly say, \u201cBeen walking long?\u201d Well, some autistic teens haven\u2019t been \u201ctalking long.\u201d Mastering the art of conversation is something that many of them are still working on, and will continue to. They might likely end the conversation by bluntly saying, \u201cI\u2019m done talking now. Bye.\u201d Again, they don\u2019t mean to be rude. Don\u2019t take it personally.\nDo be aware, especially if talking outside, that autistic teens may react wildly to an insect that flies near them or to a sound that startles them or a sudden bright light in their eyes. Just accept that it\u2019s part of who they are, and know that they can\u2019t help it and they deal with it as best as they can.\nDon\u2019t feel slighted if you say hi to them in passing and they don\u2019t respond. They\u2019re so busy filtering all the sensory input of wherever they are and trying to organize their brain that a passing hello often won\u2019t register until after you\u2019ve passed them. Again, don\u2019t take it personally. Really \u2013 they cannot help it. Many autistic teens also contend with face-blindness.\nDo realize that even though an autistic teen may not show many facial expressions while interacting, most of them still want friends, and all of them have feelings. They probably really appreciate that you\u2019re taking the time to get to know them and understand them, but they don\u2019t know how to tell you that. Be persistent but respectful. They are worth it! And so are you. Take it from a parent of an autistic teen \u2013 we appreciate you more than words can say.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-blindness"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/04/05/getting-to-know-an-autistic-teen/", "title": "Getting to Know an Autistic Teen"},

Some of them can be quite involved, restrictive, and difficult to follow on a daily basis, while some aren\u2019t quite so limiting. All of them serve a purpose for the autistic person: to establish order, a little predictability in an unpredictable world. They don\u2019t know what kids at school will say to them from one minute to the next, or if an insect will fly near them at any given time, or if a sudden loud sound will torment them in the grocery store, or if they have to go somewhere unfamiliar. But they do know that when they get home, they can somersault down the hallway, they can eat their snacks in the exact order that they choose, and they can watch a movie they\u2019ve seen dozens of times and repeat all the lines while they watch it. And the stress of the day will be lifted.\nSo, as we can see, routines are also calming. That\u2019s why one of the most important routines of all is the bedtime routine. For many, it involves bathing, a snack, reading a book, setting out clothes and preparing a sack lunch for the next day, brushing teeth, etc. Nigel does most of those things, but his favorite part of the evening ritual is listening to Music to Relax. \nEvery night we play it while he is getting ready for bed in his room. We turn on a softer light, we turn off the computer and TV, and the soothing classical music of this wonderful CD helps Nigel to slow his mind down and prepare for a restful night\u2019s sleep. I tell you, it\u2019s amazing. Nigel has listened to other CDs designed to be listened to while going to sleep, and they were quite helpful for a time. But the important difference is listening to Music to Relax for a half an hour before he even climbs into bed. Then he listens to the rest of the CD after I come and say goodnight to him and indulge him in his quick sunglasses ritual. And then he falls asleep quicker than he ever has before.\nThis is the second Advanced Brain Technologies CD that I\u2019ve tried and reviewed, and I am once again thoroughly impressed with the results.

{"date": "April 13, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tPlease note, this originally appeared as a guest post on a blog that is no longer available.\n\nRemember what was said when we were kids and a friend gave us something? \u201cYou can have it for keeps.\u201d And it meant that we didn\u2019t have to give it back. \u201cKeep\u201d is a word with many different meanings. We hear various phrases: \u201cKeep up the good work!\u201d or \u201cKeep in touch!\u201d or \u201cEarn your keep!\u201d and \u201cFinders keepers!\u201d It means \u201cto maintain possession of,\u201d \u201cto continue, perform, observe, fulfill,\u201d \u201cto preserve and care for,\u201d \u201cboard and lodging,\u201d \u201cto hold,\u201d and \u201cto endure.\u201d \nBut a keep is also the stronghold of a castle, a fortress. The keep is the most resilient part. It\u2019s what holds everything together during an attack. And in each of us, it\u2019s what helps us to endure the rough patches of our lives. Whether we have special needs children or are recovering from an addiction or have lost a loved one, we need to find our inner keep to see us through. For many, it\u2019s God, for others, it\u2019s their health, their goals, their home, or their family. It can be all of the above, or something entirely different.\u00a0 \nAs the single parent of two sons, one with autism, I discovered my inner keep a few years ago. It is my energy. I\u2019m not really referring to physical energy, although that certainly helps. I\u2019m talking about mental energy, emotional energy, and spiritual energy. I learned that if I didn\u2019t nourish my mind, my heart, and my spirit as well as my body, there would be no way that I could nourish my children. I learned this because I used to have co-workers and acquaintances say to me, \u201cYou\u2019re so strong.\u201d And I knew that they meant well, of course, but little did they know that those words \u2013 meant to encourage \u2013 would only succeed in making me want to break down and cry. I was going through the motions, doing what I had to do to get through my stressful life. \u201cStrong\u201d was the last thing I felt like. I felt like a piece of burned paper that would crumble to ashes at the slightest touch. I felt entirely the opposite of how I appeared to be. A hug from a friend would make me fall apart. I hadn\u2019t found my keep. I didn\u2019t know I needed to.\nSlowly it became clear to me what I needed to feel stronger, to make the fa\u00e7ade a reality. I started by taking care of my physical self \u2013 getting more sleep as the boys got older, eating healthier food and taking vitamins, and doing a little yoga at home. Soon, not only did my body feel better, my spirit did, too. The yoga helped to quiet my mind, which led to trying different types of meditation. The meditation led to the realization that I had isolated myself and needed to correct that in order to nourish my emotional energy. It was a wonderful domino effect. And all of it combined to help me feel whole \u2013 and stronger. Now when people tell me that I\u2019m strong, I don\u2019t feel like crying. My life certainly still feels stressful on any given day, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m barely hanging on. \nNo matter what you\u2019re going through, I encourage you to find your keep. Find what strengthens you and nourish it, whether it\u2019s your faith, your family, or your frame of mind. Whatever it is, it\u2019s for keeps.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/04/13/finding-my-keep/", "title": "Finding My Keep"},

Last week\u2019s hour-long scan, the \u201cit\u2019s-probably-not-this-but-let\u2019s-just-rule-it-out\u201d actually turned out positive: a condition called Meckel\u2019s diverticulosis. It occurs in about 2% of the population. Of that 2%, only 5% have symptoms requiring surgery. Of the 5% with symptoms, the vast majority show symptoms by age 2. It is extremely rare for symptoms to be apparent after age 10, which is why they didn\u2019t think it was what Aidan had. In all cases, the diverticulum forms in utero, so Aidan\u2019s has been affecting him for close to thirteen years.\nSo yes \u2013 that part about surgery. Aidan will need to have surgery to remove the diverticulum from his intestines. They also want to schedule a sigmoidoscopy before the surgery to check for polyps or any other problems since we have a family history of colon cancer. So my little guy will go through two invasive procedures in the space of two weeks. I am still trying to wrap my mind around all of this, and Aidan is scared. So scared that he actually told me that he\u2019s scared. He was scared before we found out about the Meckel\u2019s, wondering what was happening with him, and now he\u2019s scared about the surgery. I tried to assuage his fear by mentioning several family members who\u2019ve come through surgery just fine, but the fact is that I\u2019m scared too. I don\u2019t like this one bit. I just keep telling myself that at least it\u2019s fixable. The \u201cgood\u201d news is that once the diverticulum is\u00a0removed and the intestines repaired properly, there are usually no long-term problems. There is some remote risk of post-op complications involving infection, but that\u2019s not going to happen, I tell myself. He will be fine.

Apparently a scene from Walking With Dinosaurs had been filmed there, so Nigel had to act out the part with the sauropodlet (as Nigel calls\u00a0baby sauropods) eating fern fronds.\n\nAt any rate, the boys and I loved roaming among the quiet, steadfast giants, and Nigel had fun climbing on the trunks of the fallen. Not wanting to violate any park rules, I checked for signs forbidding climbing. I didn\u2019t see any, and Nigel was being careful, so we went on our way.

{"date": "May 24, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tFor several of Nigel\u2019s early years, both before and after his autism diagnosis, his dad and I thought that he was afraid of the vacuum cleaner. It wasn\u2019t until we learned about sensory issues \u2013 and noticed that Nigel had the same \u201cfear\u201d of leaf blowers, blenders, food processors, and air hand driers in public restrooms \u2013 that we began to realize that he didn\u2019t fear these objects. He could not filter the loud, invasive sounds they made. The sounds were so painful to him that he learned to run to a different room if he saw the things that produced them. And when he couldn\u2019t run to a different room, he would scream. He wouldn\u2019t even cover his ears because he didn\u2019t know how. It actually took him a couple of years to learn that he could do that when he heard a loud sound.\nAs the years went by, covering his ears became second nature to him. And slowly he\u00a0learned how to filter the sounds that were previously so agonizing for him. But\u00a0as his sensory issues became more manageable, he developed real fears to take their place. I\u2019ve mentioned before that he is afraid of bees and other flying insects, and a close second, also in the flying category, are bats. Yes, my son, the zombie movie aficionado, is afraid of bats. And this, in addition to Aidan\u2019s mild claustrophobia, has prevented us for years from going as a family to nearby Oregon Caves National Monument, which I enjoyed as a child. But I am nothing if not determined. Every year for the past five years I\u2019ve tried to chip away a little at the bat fear. One year I bought Stellaluna. Last year for homeschooling we studied bats on Wikipedia, something that Nigel likes to refer to. This year I found my old Oregon Caves pamphlet which distinctly says that the bat population \u201cpeaks in the fall when bats swarm to breed,\u201d and told him that both times I had been to Oregon Caves, I had not seen a single bat. So this year, in the spring, he was finally ready. And Aidan decided that since Nigel was going to stare down a fear, he was game to do the same.\nWe arrived early so that we wouldn\u2019t have to wait long for our tour, and started off with our Ranger tour guide and a group of fifteen other people. We spent over an hour inside the cave of amazing calcite formations, and both boys did really well. At one point, Nigel got a little nervous because the Ranger mentioned that there might be a bat in one of the rooms up ahead, and Nigel growled at another visitor to shut off his camera so that the flash would not upset the bat, causing it to fly into his face. But Nigel quickly regained his composure and proceeded into the room, and I was so proud of him that he went ahead in spite of his fear. Much to our relief, there were no visible bats, and Aidan was fine until the very end, when the cave started to get to him. But he stayed calm, and they both completed the tour. Yes, you read that correctly \u2013 they both completed the tour! No panic attacks! No screaming, yelling, or bolting! No whining even! I guess it was like teaching Nigel to cover his ears when he was little \u2013 it just took a few years of teaching and preparation. When he was ready, he was fine.\nAs a treat, I took them to get burgers for dinner at a restaurant. Right after our food arrived and we started digging in, the opening lyrics of a Queen song began. Nigel stopped and listened. \u201cHey \u2013 what\u2019s this song?\u201d he asked.\n\u201c\u2018Bohemian Rhapsody,'\u201d Aidan answered.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nigel said, still listening. Then he remembered. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018We Are the Champions.'\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Aidan agreed. (I just discovered while writing this post that last week this song was performed on the season finale of American Idol. The boys and I do not watch this show, so they were trying to remember from hearing one of my old CDs years ago.)\nThen Nigel looked at me, making full eye contact. \u201cThis is the perfect song for us to hear tonight. You know \u2013 because we are the champions of the cave.\u201d\nI just gazed into his gorgeous medium brown eyes that I seldom see directly and tried to choke down my burger. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cYou guys are the champions of that cave.\u201d\nThen Nigel quietly sang, \u201cWe are the champions . . . of the cave.\u201d And my heart swelled with pride.\n\n\u00a0\u201cParadise Lost\u201d \u2013 the room where the bat was supposed to be.\n\nNigel and a new friend!\n\nEnd of the tour \u2013 jacket and hood completely off!\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nps.gov/orca/", "http://www.amazon.com/Stellaluna-Janell-Cannon/dp/3551515212/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1243229970&sr=1-2", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/05/24/autism-and-fears/", "title": "Autism and Fears"},
{"date": "June 1, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tClenched teeth and narrow eyes? Angry. Tears streaming down face? Sad. Smile? Happy. Open mouth and wide eyes? Scared. Furrowed brow and tight lips? Not sure.\nOver the years, Nigel has learned to read the cues of basic emotions and identify them, but he has yet to do the same for emotions that are less easily recognized, such as worry, relief, disinterest, embarrassment, confusion, and disappointment. They talk about these in his social skills class, and we talk about them at home, of course, but it\u2019s hard for him to catch on. And it\u2019s always difficult to apply the situations of Social Skills Class to the real world, although it\u2019s certainly worth trying. Today, however, I stumbled across a more effective method.\nIt\u2019s Disaster Movie Weekend here at Chez Nigel, during which he watches everything but the 2008 parody/spoof called Disaster Movie, which, he says,\u00a0is not a real disaster movie. After cleaning his room more thoroughly than ever before, he was rewarded with a full movie weekend while Mom works (mostly) unhindered in her office, appearing only to make dinner (that was the plan, anyway). Nigel began with various Godzilla flicks, moved on to Deep Impact, Core, Volcano, and finished with his favorites, Twister and The Day After Tomorrow.\nI\u2019ve never been able to figure out why he enjoys these types of movies so much, but he has for a long time. He first saw Twister at the age of five, and has loved it ever since. He\u2019ll rarely go more than a few weeks without watching it. Then a few years ago came The Day After Tomorrow, and all I can say is at least we now have an alternative to Twister. DAT has everything he loves about disaster movies \u2013 imminent destruction and earnest people trying to either stop it from happening or survive it. He doesn\u2019t care about the writing or the acting. He doesn\u2019t care if the movie got bad reviews. He\u2019s just concerned with the main idea and the special effects (although he lets that slide for the old Godzilla movies he holds so dear).\nSo he\u2019s watching The Day After Tomorrow out in the living room, and I venture out of my office in the early afternoon to facilitate lunch. I come and stand beside the couch, watching a scene near the end in which the father is reunited with his teenage son, for whom he had been searching. I\u2019ve unwillingly\u00a0watched this scene (and the whole movie) several times before, but something \u2013 my frame of mind, the loving energy that filled our home this weekend, something \u2013 makes it affect me differently this time. I stand there watching the scene, feeling emotional and trying to fight it. I think that I\u2019m keeping it low-key and don\u2019t think my appearance is that noticeable.\nNigel looks at me and says, \u201cYour face. It\u2019s making some sort of expression.\u201d\nAnd then I about lose it. My breath catches in my throat, and I have to turn away as tears pool in my eyes. He noticed! He didn\u2019t know what the expression was for, but he noticed a subtle facial cue! I dab my eyes and compose myself, then turn back to my son.\n\u201cYes, Nigel, it\u2019s an expression of emotion. I was just feeling how the father felt in the movie when he found his son and hugged him. He was happy, but all the anxiety that he felt while looking for him just built up in that moment and made him emotional. Does that make sense to you?\u201d\n\u201cI think so.\u201d\nI tell him how great it is that he\u2019s starting to notice the subtle expressions of emotion that people show, not just the more obvious ones of anger, sadness, happiness, or fear. Like talking, like writing, like learning to be polite, this is probably something that will take him a long time to develop.

{"date": "June 2, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tRemember Alex Barton? Let me jog your memory \u2013 he\u2019s the boy whose Kindergarten teacher saw fit to have his fellow students vote him out of the class, as if it were a Survivor episode. After reading about it, I was beside myself with strong emotions: sadness, disbelief, and fury. How DARE (yes, I\u2019m yelling) that teacher disregard the self-esteem of one of her students? How DARE she teach her other students to insult him and cast him aside, instead of helping them to show compassion because of his differences?\nWell, friends, fortunately the story didn\u2019t end there. It was the beginning of another story \u2013 one of love, acceptance, and connectedness. A way to show Alex that people do care, that people are supportive. And we can all be a part of it.\nMelissa Barton, Alex\u2019s mom, with a little inspiration from Kyra of ThisMom, came up with The Tie-Dye Project. It began with Alex and his mom making five tie-dyed shirts and sending them out to five ASD kids. Each of those kids (and their parents) received\u00a0a note\u00a0on how to continue the project \u2013 just make five more tie-dyed shirts and send them out to five ASD kids. When was the last time a fun project had so much meaning behind it? Love, support, and understanding among kids on the spectrum. It\u2019s a wonderful thing.\nYesterday Nigel received his shirt from Kendall. \u201cThis is really nice,\u201d he said, checking it out. I told him about Alex, and Nigel is very excited to be a part of the shirt-making chain for ASD kids. He\u2019s raring to go, so all we need now are five participants who would like to receive a tie-dye shirt from Nigel! Just leave a comment if you\u2019d like one, even if you\u2019ve not left a comment before, and I\u2019ll email you to get your address.\nJoin in! As Nigel said to me in his flat but beautiful voice, \u201cWe need to get the word out.\u201d And we will.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2008/may/24/30gtteacher-lets-students-vote-out-classmate-5/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(TV_series)", "http://www.justiceforalexbarton.com/", "http://thismom.com/", "http://blog.justiceforalexbarton.com/2009/03/15/the-tie-dye-project.aspx", "http://jesswilson.wordpress.com/2009/04/07/the-tie-dye-project/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/06/02/the-tie-dye-project/", "title": "The Tie-Dye Project"},
{"date": "June 4, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tBetcha didn\u2019t know! June is National Adopt-A-Cat Month!\nDid I hear a \u2018so what?\u2019 I know. Many people are allergic to cats. Many people prefer dogs. Many people prefer fish, rodents, or reptiles. And that\u2019s okay. Because any pet will teach a child responsibility, compassion, how to handle death, and more. Pets also bring comfort, amusement, and can present a calming influence. I know. Every day I see the benefits of having pets \u2013 with both of my boys.\nOver the years, we\u2019ve been the proud humans of five cats, a dog, a rat, a mouse, and several fish. Currently, we share our abode with three wonderful cats, two adopted from local shelters and one from a neighbor. There\u2019s Midnight, our sleek black male shorthair, Sheba, our pretty black-and-tan tabby (see her here!), and our medium-haired little gray girl, which Nigel named Winter (see below). The boys love all of the cats, but Winter\u2019s the newest, so she gets the most attention. Nigel will hold her and walk through the house, saying to anyone in earshot, \u201cLook at her! Just look at her! Look at how cute she is! It\u2019s like she jumped straight out of a painting.\u201d Then he snuggles his face into hers and says, \u201cIf your parents could meet you now, they\u2019d be so proud of you!\u201d Aidan loves her\u00a0just as much. He bursts through the front door when he gets home from school every day and says, \u201cWhere\u2019s Winter? Where\u2019s that little princess? I have to pet her!\u201d And then he squeals when he finds her. They are in love with this cat.\nAnd since she\u2019s not their first cat, they\u2019ve learned about death from the ones that came before her. We had one hit by a car a few years ago, and as sad as it was for the boys (and me), our cat\u2019s death helped prepare them\u00a0emotionally for their great-grandfather\u2019s death\u00a0several months later. And when Nigel\u2019s very own pet mouse, that he kept in his room and was responsible for entirely, died last year, he handled it with more maturity than I would ever have expected.\nOh, yes, they grumble and complain about having to empty the litter box. They \u201cforget\u201d to do it. But then they see what happens when they \u201cforget,\u201d and they realize that their pets are dependent upon them for their care. And they learn about treating their pets with kindness and respect. Sometimes, this carries over into their dealings with people. At least, that\u2019s the idea.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that people on the spectrum can often relate to animals easier than they can to people, such as Temple Grandin with cows or John Elder Robison and dogs. I definitely see this with Nigel. He was playing with Winter a few days ago, pulling a string through the house and laughing as she chased it. After some time, he put the string away and went to the kitchen to get a snack. Then he went to his bedroom to get something, and after that he went to the bathroom. Winter followed him closely the entire time, running right alongside him like a little gray shadow. After a minute of this I heard Nigel say to her, \u201cThere\u2019s no way of escaping you, Winter, but I\u2019m glad of it!\u201d He said it in such a sweet, loving tone, with more inflection than he\u2019s ever used when talking to people.\n*sigh* \u00a0A boy and his cat.

{"date": "May 28, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\u201cYou\u2019re lucky he\u2019s so high-functioning.\u201d \u2013 people who mean well\n*\nI\u2019ve heard it a few times over the years. And I\u2019ve never been\u00a0sure how to respond. I mean, the first time it was said was by someone in a park when my son was running and laughing. He was four and non-verbal. \u00a0So . . . not sure how non-verbal equaled high-functioning. Not sure how a complete stranger could make an assessment like that after observing my son for one minute.\u00a0 Perhaps, since it was 1998, the person didn\u2019t really know much about autism and thought it was a predominantly physical disability. Perhaps if someone had turned on a leaf blower and my son had started screaming, the person would not have said that. Perhaps if she had asked him his name and not received an answer from him, she might have thought differently about his functioning level. Not sure. I really didn\u2019t have time to get into it with her. A second later, Nigel darted for the street, and I ran after him. High-functioning.\nHigh-functioning can be misleading. Now, people see him as a high-functioning verbal teen. And that\u2019s what he is. But what they don\u2019t see are the years and years behind that high-functioning teen. The years of language acquisition through echolalia, over a decade of speech therapy, and daily life. The years of learning to filter sensory issues so that he can function semi-comfortably in various environments, even those as basic as classrooms, restaurants, grocery stores, and public restrooms. The years of learning appropriate and inappropriate behavior, with which he still struggles.\nWhen people see a high-functioning verbal teen, they don\u2019t see the daily medications he must take to manage his behavior and his anxiety. They don\u2019t see the daily doses of\u00a0risperidone and sertraline. They don\u2019t see the subdued quality in his eyes that his mother has had to get used to seeing, because she knows it helps her son to achieve his goal of being mainstreamed in his local public school. Without the medication, he would not be able to manage his behavior. That is one way that high-functioning autism affects him. Being able to communicate is huge, but it is not the only issue.\nWhen people see a high-functioning verbal teen, they don\u2019t see how he\u2019s been bullied and harassed and taken advantage of. They don\u2019t see his trusting nature, they don\u2019t see his lower emotional age, they don\u2019t see his vulnerability. They don\u2019t see how because he has to spend his days working so hard \u00a0\u2013 to filter the sensory issues of daily life, focus on trying to be appropriately social, and try to concentrate on school work \u2013 that he is exhausted. That sometimes it\u2019s all too much for him, being autistic in this world.\nYet he continues to try, he continues to want to. He has a certain joie de vivre that I envy. Because of his autism, he doesn\u2019t understand certain social obligations that will affect him very soon, as he enters adulthood. He wants to be an inventor when he grows up \u2013 an inventor of time machines. And while the finished product would most likely be quite lucrative, he doesn\u2019t understand that he needs to have some type of income while he\u2019s inventing his time machine, so that he can buy food for himself and pay for his shelter. When I try to explain this to him, he suggests that we should all live like our early human ancestors, in a very primordial sense. He says this with conviction, the same conviction with which he discusses his time machine. I don\u2019t see that going over well in a job interview. High-functioning.\nThere are still so many things that others don\u2019t see. Because they see a high-functioning teen, their expectations are higher, and while we should never sell our ASD kids short in what they can accomplish, we as parents know where the difficulties lie. We know how their delays in emotional and social development still affect them. We worry about how they will interact with people who don\u2019t know them when we\u2019re not with them to facilitate. We know that there are things about living in our society that they cannot understand, such as having a job and paying the bills. Yes, my son is now high-functioning, but he has fought tooth and nail (literally, sometimes) to get there. If there was any luck involved, it was because every time he\u2019s wandered away or bolted into the street or lit something on fire, he\u2019s never been harmed. So yes, to everyone who\u2019s ever said that I\u2019m lucky, I am. \u00a0High-functioning or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/05/28/lucky/", "title": "Lucky"},

{"date": "March 17, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tA short conversation with Nigel last night \u2013\nMe: Nigel, you really need to clean up your room. I can\u2019t even see the floor in there.\nNigel: The floor is purposeless.\nMe: No, it is not \u2018purposeless.\u2019 The floor is for walking on to get across the room.\nNigel: Walking is purposeless.\nMe: You\u2019re not making sense. Of course walking has a purpose.\nNigel: Well, it\u2019s too hard to clean my room.\nAnd so, the room-cleaning saga continues. Some of you may recall the ideas I came up with in the past to address this issue, such as listing specific steps to clean the room, making chore charts, using positive and negative reinforcement, and trying to inject humor into the situation. All of those things worked a few times; none of them work now. With five full inches of trash, clothing, books, DVDs, papers, and Lego strewn across his entire floor, I had to dig deeper to come up with a solution.\nI remembered Mama Mara\u2019s post from a few months ago discussing the concept of executive control and her son\u2019s room, and I used that to fuel my search. I searched for more about executive control/function, and specifically, cleaning up rooms. I found a video on Autism Children Now\u00a0that was quite helpful. The subject, a woman with Asperger\u2019s, discusses the fact that ASD individuals have a different perception of what is organized. It reminded me of the following exchange I overheard between Nigel and Aidan a few years ago:\nAidan: You\u2019re using my toothbrush, Nigel! Mine\u2019s the one with the stickers on it.\nNigel: Sorry, my brain is not good with memorizing things like that.\nAidan: That\u2019s because you\u2019re not organized!\nThe Aspergian woman in the video maintained that when it appears that autistic people\u2019s living areas are disorganized, the spaces\u00a0aren\u2019t disorganized to them. They know where everything is. And while I am sure that this is true in many cases, unfortunately it\u2019s not with Nigel. He doesn\u2019t know where everything is. Things get lost in his room, swallowed up. Last weekend he had an overnight Scout camping trip, and while packing he could not find his flashlight, compass, Swiss Army knife, or even any socks, all of which were buried. We had to go out and buy these things at the last minute, which did not make me happy. I could dock his allowance for these items, but that really doesn\u2019t help him to learn how to be more organized.\nWhat to do? The woman in the video made an important point: compromise is the key word. Compromise on organization, and do not be abstract in your instructions. I can\u2019t just say, \u201cNigel, you need to organize your room better.\u201d What I can do is compromise on the things that I want him to have organized. For example, I can have him agree to the following:\n\nDaily trash pick-up, every evening at the same time\nSocks go directly in laundry bin when taken off\nScout items or other easily lost items put in a designated spot\n\nI would love to have him clean his room thoroughly every week, but I know this is not possible for him. I would love to have all of his clothes in his dresser,\u00a0closet,\u00a0or in the laundry instead of on the floor, the books and DVDs on the actual shelves that are set up for them, the papers in stacks or files, and everything organized the way the rest of my house is. But there\u2019s no compromise in that. With the 3-step list, he won\u2019t feel overwhelmed, and I don\u2019t have to hear \u201cI don\u2019t have any socks\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t find my flashlight/compass/scissors/wallet\u201d anymore. And, if I\u2019m really lucky, I won\u2019t have to wade through five inches of trash to tuck him in bed every night.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mamamara.blogspot.com/2008/12/tornadic-brain-and-executive.html", "http://www.childdevelopmentpartners.com/blog/category/executive-functioning", "http://www.autismchildrennow.info/?p=444", "http://www.autismchildrennow.info/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/03/17/executive-compromise/", "title": "Executive Compromise"},

{"date": "March 12, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tAfter a fifteen-month hiatus while homeschooling, Nigel started back part-time at the local public school this week. How has it gone for him? Today was Day 3, and I had to write the following email, which was sent to the school\u2019s special education coordinator, the district\u2019s special education director, the regional autism consultant, and his social skills class facilitator:\nEveryone,\nI wanted to bring a concern of mine to your attention. Today when I picked Nigel up after lunch, he came out to the car twirling around in the parking lot with a sheepish look on his face. Apparently a group of girls had been hanging around him at lunch, and they told him that another boy had \u201cstolen\u201d someone\u2019s cookie, and that he \u2013 Nigel \u2013 needed to \u201cdo something about it,\u201d even though Nigel had nothing to do with the situation (which I think was contrived). So Nigel said that he chased the boy around to impress the girls, because they encouraged him to. This is just the sort of social problem that causes concerns. Nigel is usually fine in class where it\u2019s structured and supervised, but these problems come up at lunch. The kids are not overtly being mean, but they take advantage of both Nigel\u2019s trusting nature and his yearning to be accepted, and they get him to do things that either make a fool out of him or get him in trouble. After Nigel had chased the kid around, one of the girls linked arms with Nigel and walked somewhere and kissed him, in front of others. These kids are having fun at Nigel\u2019s expense, even though he doesn\u2019t realize it because of his autism.\nSo I talked with him about a) not chasing anyone around for any reason, and b) not doing things kids tell him to do when he\u2019s at lunch. If this continues, not only will he wind up getting in trouble, when it was not his idea in the first place, but it\u2019s continuing a vicious cycle of using him for entertainment \u2013 he told me that the girls actually told him that he was \u201centertaining.\u201d I do not want my son used in this manner! This has happened before at this school, and I\u2019m upset about it happening again. Is it possible for situations like this to be roll-played in the social skills class? Nigel needs to be able to recognize when his peers are using him for entertainment, since the school doesn\u2019t seem to think it\u2019s important to teach the non-autistic kids not to take advantage of those with social difficulties.\nThe risperidone is helping Nigel, and he is making such an effort, is so motivated to get back, and he has to deal with kids who try to make a fool of him and get him in trouble. This is why I mentioned the Circle of Friends program at the meeting last week, and why I think it\u2019s so important to implement something like that. The school needs to foster awareness and compassion for students with social difficulties. No one would dare treat someone that way who\u2019s in a wheelchair, so why does the administration say things like \u201cthis is a hard age\u201d when someone who does not have a visible disability is targeted? This issue needs to be addressed. I realize that Nigel will be moving on from\u00a0this school\u00a0soon [because he is in 8th grade], but he has four more years in this district with the same peers, and there are others coming after him who would also benefit from a program like Circle of Friends. How can we go about setting this up?\nThank you,\nTanya Savko\nThe good news is that within a half an hour, the district special education director sent me a very supportive response thanking me for notifying her, telling me that she would meet with the school principal tomorrow, and, most importantly, assuring me that she is \u201ccommitted to making this work for Nigel.\u201d\nIt sometimes takes awhile \u2013 we were having these school issues two years ago \u2013\u00a0but the squeaky wheel\u00a0eventually gets the grease.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/03/12/an-open-letter-to-my-sons-school-administrators/", "title": "An Open Letter to My Son\u2019s School Administrators"},
{"date": "March 18, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nSometimes, when I\u2019m writing, I just don\u2019t know where to begin. A quote is nice as a hook, and so is a well-crafted topic sentence. Once I figure out the beginning, I can usually organize my thoughts well enough to write a fairly decent piece. But sometimes the ending gives me trouble. Or my transitions are choppy. It doesn\u2019t always flow.\nNigel has trouble with all of these things, every time he writes. He usually has plenty to say (these days), but organizing all of his thoughts is difficult for him. He is back in regular school, but because it\u2019s part-time, some of his subjects still fall under the homeschooling umbrella. Language Arts is one of them. Fortunately, I used to be a writing tutor, so I\u2019ve got some experience in figuring out how to teach someone to write. I\u2019ve worked with ESL (English as a Second Language) students, dyslexic students, and other students with special needs. But Nigel is my first autistic student.\nLast year, I started off teaching him to type, which went very well, and then he wrote a few small paragraphs as reviews of educational videos he had watched. The trouble started this year when I had to explain to him that cutting and pasting paragraphs from Wikipedia articles was not an acceptable way to write an essay. But if I stop to think about it, that way of learning to write is exactly the way he learned to talk \u2013 by using words he had heard somewhere else. Yes, with writing it\u2019s plagiarism, but I like to\u00a0think of\u00a0it as\u00a0\u201cecholalic writing.\u201d So, just as he learned to talk when his speech was predominantly echolalic, I slowly guided him to use his own words in his writing. We began with a narrative essay, then an imaginative one, both three paragraphs long. Once he realized that he could write a full essay with his own words, I then upped the ante to a five-paragraph persuasive essay. He chose the topic \u2013 Stricter Rules Against Bullies. I helped him draft an outline, and then he typed the first draft.\nOne of the necessities of a persuasive essay, of course, is addressing the opposing viewpoint. Nigel, with his theory-of-mind challenges, declared, \u201cI can\u2019t mind read! How should I know what the opposing viewpoint is?!\u201d And of course, that made all kinds of sense, coming from an autistic mind. I should have realized that the concept would have been difficult for him. After explaining that he should try to think of how he would feel if he were the other person, I realized that I was getting nowhere, and Nigel was only getting more frustrated. I finally had a brainstorm, albeit an obvious one. \u201cNigel,\u201d I said, \u201cread one of your reasons that you listed for why there needs to be stricter rules against bullies, and think of what you would say to someone who disagreed with you.\u201d He took that and ran with it.\nIt\u2019s Spring Break now, so he\u2019s not writing, but when we get back to it in a week and a half, he\u2019ll be working on his first essay involving research and citing sources. It\u2019ll be a challenge for him, and will probably take him a few weeks to do it, but I think he can. I remember when he was not functionally verbal, and how glad I was that he could read, even though it was hyperlexia. I thought how wonderful it would be if he could learn to write, since he could not speak much, and he then could communicate by writing. I remember thinking that if he could write, it would liberate him to no end. And even though he can talk now, I still feel that way about him writing. He may have some difficulty with conventions, transitions, and thinking of good topic sentences. It hurts his hand to write with a utensil, which is why I knew I had to teach him to type. But now he\u2019s writing, and that will take him everywhere.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/03/18/autism-and-writing/", "title": "Autism and Writing"},

Lassen, but Aidan was enamored with the orchards. \u201cI would love to live here,\u201d he said in a dreamy voice.\nSo now they are away this week, and my home is quiet. And I have tons of things to do to fill that time, but I feel like I\u2019m missing an arm and a leg with the boys gone, and it\u2019s hard to get anything done that way. I don\u2019t feel like myself when they\u2019re not here. I\u2019m living in a suspended reality.\nI sometimes wonder if that\u2019s what life is like for Nigel \u2013 he has his way of viewing the world, and a lot of it is very different from how others view it. And I especially wonder how it is for him being on Risperidone. He is calmer, yes, and can regulate his behavior a bit better, but he is not himself. It is a subdued version of him, a suspended reality. \u00a0His eyes \u2013 and his demeanor \u2013 are different. I know \u2013 this was what we wanted. He wanted it, too. We wanted the change in behavior. But I didn\u2019t know there would be a change in him, in his countenance. \u00a0\nAgain I remind myself that he doesn\u2019t need to be on it forever \u2013 just a couple of years, I hope, until he learns to regulate his behavior himself. And eventually he will, of that I am sure. He says he can feel the difference in himself, and he is satisfied with the results, which is most important. But I\u2019m looking forward to the day when he no longer needs to take it, and I can have the real Nigel back. For now, though, I know that I\u2019ll still enjoy the company of the modified Nigel. He may not appear to be himself right now, but he\u2019s still unequivocally Nigel. \u00a0And I\u2019ll smile as I think of him at the sunny beach this week, while I watch the snow fall.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/03/22/suspended-reality/", "title": "Suspended Reality"},

It feels like no one\u2019s paying attention, like the only people who care are the ones who are in the same shoes. It doesn\u2019t seem like anyone who could really make a difference is taking notice. Well, someone finally did.\nI got home from work yesterday and showered, getting ready to go see a movie with a friend. As I was preparing a quick dinner for myself, the phone rang. I answered, and it was someone from our local news station requesting to come and interview me (!) about \u201cthe new Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder that was created by the Governor today\u201d (!) \u201cWow,\u201d I said, grasping for a semi-intelligent response since a) I hadn\u2019t managed to catch any news yet and had not heard about the Commission, b) they\u2019d probably gotten my contact info from the Autism Society of Oregon since I\u2019m a Chapter Rep, and I didn\u2019t want to sound completely ignorant, and c) I\u2019d never been interviewed by the news before. (!) To be on TV. (!) At least I had already showered.\nAfter we set up a time to do the interview, I ran around cleaning the living room, of course. Then I did a quick search to get some info on the Commission and our illustrious Governor here in the beautiful state of Oregon, which yielded the following:\nGovernor Creates Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder\n(Salem)\u00a0\u2013 Today Governor Ted Kulongoski signed Executive Order 09-07, creating the Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The commission is charged with creating greater coordination and planning to better engage and provide services for individuals experiencing ASD and their families.\n\u201cOregon, like other states, has seen a dramatic increase in the number of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder,\u201d Governor Kulongoski said. \u201cThis commission is an important first step in ensuring that individuals experiencing ASD and their families receive the services they need to face the challenges that come with the disorder.\u201d\nAcross Oregon, services to people experiencing ASD have been fragmented and inconsistent, resulting in poor coordination with the various agencies and entities that provide services. The commission will make recommendations to increase coordination and collaboration through the identification of policies and strategies that will improve interagency agreements and address funding issues . . .\u00a0\u201cThis commission will help make sure Oregon is incorporating all of the best information available on autism in treating and supporting those experiencing ASD,\u201d Governor Kulongoski said. \u201cThe commission will also ensure we are getting the maximum benefit from local, state and federal resources.\u201d\nAnd then came my 15 Minutes!

{"date": "March 25, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tI\u2019ve never been called a social butterfly. Not even close. I am a happy introvert. My Facebook \u201cAbout Me\u201d section says:\u00a0 I have two sons, one autistic, one not. Both are more social than I am. So I started blogging.\nBut long before I started blogging, I noticed something happening that I wasn\u2019t too comfortable with. Nigel\u2019s diagnosis threw me into frequent meetings with various therapists, teachers, doctors, and other people. Then Aidan\u2019s special needs became apparent, and I had to deal with even more therapists, more people. As my sons learned to talk, I noticed that they were not introverts. One got interested in Scouting (actually both did, at first), and the other one went to a lot of friends\u2019 houses. I met the friends\u2019 parents. I met the Scouting parents. Some of them even became my friends. \u00a0As the years went by, I met more teachers and therapists and other parents. The fact is that both of my kids, especially my autistic one, have gotten me out of my comfort zone. And I discovered wonderful people \u2013 and a side of myself \u2013 that I might never have known.\nEven so, when I have to go to a meeting or call someone I don\u2019t know, I still step outside my comfort zone on a weekly basis. But people with autism, whether introverted or extroverted, have to get outside of their comfort zones every day. Nigel, with his fear of bees and other flying insects, gets outside of his comfort zone every time he steps outside. He gets outside of his comfort zone every time he enters a public restroom and wonders if there\u2019s an air hand dryer on the wall, and if someone will use it while he\u2019s in there. He is outside of his comfort zone whenever a baby begins to cry or an alarm goes off or a light is too bright. How many times a day does he step outside of his comfort zone?\nI attended a dinner party tonight, and I only knew one person there, someone I hadn\u2019t seen for almost four years. I was definitely outside of my comfort zone. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m shy, it\u2019s just that it takes a lot of energy for me to pull that off, to push myself to be social. But I\u2019ve been doing a lot more of that in recent years, and you know what? I laughed and broke bread with these lovely people, and I talked about autism and homeschooling and my job and places I\u2019ve traveled, and I really enjoyed myself. In fact, at some point during the evening it dawned on me that I couldn\u2019t be out of my comfort zone because, well, I was comfortable. I really was.\nIt\u2019s hard to get out of our comfort zones, whether we\u2019re autistic or just introverted (or in some cases, both). But I think if we do it enough times, our comfort zones evolve. Nigel is now comfortable in grocery stores and restaurants, places that used to cause him such agony. He likes these places and asks to go to them. The last time we went to a movie theater, he didn\u2019t even need to use ear plugs. Some comfort zones may always be difficult to step out of, regardless of how much we try. But others, with time and patient attempts, can change. It\u2019s good to stretch ourselves, whether we\u2019re conscious of it or not. We stretch a little bit, and our spirits are encouraged to keep going, keep stretching. The rewards are too great to miss out on.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/profile.php?id=1269241536&ref=profile"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/03/25/comfort-zones/", "title": "Comfort Zones"},

{"date": "March 29, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tYesterday, on my way home after picking up the boys from the 700-Mile Kid Swap, I thought about what it was like when we first started doing it seven years ago. I thought about how Aidan used to throw up in the car at least every hour and how Nigel, newly verbal and still figuring out syntax and pronouns, would ask, \u201cWhy you throw up?\u201d So I thought I\u2019d do a follow up to my previous post on this topic.\nIf I blogged five years ago, Nigel would have been nine and Aidan would have been seven. I would have written about how hectic it was to have two children having IEPs with one parent to attend them (and trying to find childcare beforehand). I would write about how Nigel, who had taught himself to read at age three, before he could talk, was now reading at a middle school level and could comprehend 90% of it. Conversely, I would write about how Aidan still couldn\u2019t read, even though I\u2019d read to him every single night of his life and had tried to teach him for years, and so I had him in a special reading program at his school in addition to his speech therapy.\nFive years ago, I would have blogged about emerging Nigelisms like this:\nThe Scene: Interior suburban family home. Two young brothers are seated at the dinner table while their mother serves them their plates of food. For the first time, the children are having full-size turkey burgers, as opposed to their usual half-size, so their mother placed them on buns instead of regular bread, as she had previously done. Due to their limited acceptance of foods, she wonders if they will refuse the buns.\nYounger brother, about age 5: Mom, what is this fred?\nMother: It\u2019s a bun.\nYounger brother: There are bun freds?\nOlder brother, about age 7: Not \u2018freds.\u2019 BREADS. Not an F, a B.\nNigel, as soon as he learned to talk, loved to correct Aidan, who had pronunciation issues. But one thing that surprised me a little was that Nigel seemed to want me to correct him (Nigel). If he misused a pronoun, I would gently correct him, and then he would repeat what he\u2019d said and insert the correction, as if memorizing it. It took about four years for him to learn to use pronouns, articles, prepositions, word order, and verb tenses correctly. He put so much effort into learning to talk. It always touched me how receptive he was to my gentle corrections. It was always the same \u2013 he would quietly repeat what he\u2019d said and insert the correction, then move on. This happened several times a day for a period of about four years. Having studied French for several years while in school, I recognized the process of learning a foreign language. And that was how Nigel learned to speak English \u2013 like it was a foreign language.\nIf I blogged five years ago, I would write about how I ventured back into the realm of grocery stores and the occasional restaurant with Nigel. Salon haircuts were possible for the first time with ear plugs. He was finally starting to filter out all the sounds that had been unbearable to him before. It was liberating for both of us. I would also write about my first published magazine article, \u201cAutism on the Rise,\u201d which was featured in a regional parenting magazine. I would sadly and angrily blog about the first time I heard Nigel being called a retard, and how I ran outside and yelled at the boy who said it.\nFive years ago, I would write about Nigel\u2019s incredible third grade teacher, the man who happily volunteered to take on a newly mainstreamed autistic boy, one who had struggled notably the previous school year, even with a full-time aide. Mr. Incredible welcomed Nigel, provided the structure he needed, patiently included him and encouraged his other students to do the same. He made Nigel feel so comfortable that, for the first time ever (away from home), Nigel removed the snug-fitting hood of his jacket when Mr. Incredible suggested it to him in the classroom one afternoon, after six months in his class. And Mr. Incredible was just as excited about it as I was. He still, five years later, inquires about how Nigel is doing.\nIncidentally, Mr. Incredible was also Aidan\u2019s third grade teacher. By the end of that year, Aidan was reading. And now, just three years later, he\u2019s reading at a high school level. Five years ago, I would have never thought that would be possible. That and so many other amazing things. New issues have certainly come up in the past five years \u2013 bullying, homeschooling, behavioral problems, medication, etc. \u2013 but the fact is that both of my boys continue to improve. Hope abounds.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/03/29/if-i-blogged-5-years-ago/", "title": "If I Blogged 5 Years Ago"},

{"date": "February 13, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nThere are times when we wonder why we waited so long to do something. Why we fretted, why we were hesitant. This is one of those times.\nMy family\u2019s sensitive genetic makeup is such that we respond almost immediately to anything in our systems, whether it\u2019s ibuprofen, caffeine, cold medicine, or stronger stuff. With prescriptions, doctors warn us that it may take two to three weeks to see any differences. With us, it\u2019s often by the end of the second day. For instance, eleven years ago when I was on Zoloft for OCD and anxiety, I felt noticeably better on the second day after starting it. I felt so much better that I wished I had started sooner, that I hadn\u2019t kept putting it off.\nLast weekend, Nigel began his experience with Risperidone. His doctor started him on a very low dosage, and the literature included with the prescription mentioned that we probably wouldn\u2019t see any behavioral changes for about two weeks. At the end of the second day, I could already see a difference. He was not argumentative. He was more complacent, relaxed. He was agreeable. His behavioral therapist also noticed it at his social skills class the next day. This is the kind of improvement we need for him to be able to go back to regular school. Of course, now that his body has adjusted to the very low dosage, he is no longer as agreeable as he was for the first few days, which I expected. We see the doctor in two weeks whereupon the dosage will be increased. But the process has begun. And it\u2019s working.\nAnd so, since I can already see how much this medication will help Nigel with his socialization goals, I can\u2019t help but wonder why I was so reluctant to get him started. Why didn\u2019t we do this before? Why did we constantly bang our heads into the wall (literally) in frustration, when we had options? Why was I so fearful of going this route? I don\u2019t really know, but it\u2019s not worth it to me to obsess about it any longer. Life is about learning. We learn and then we continue on. We make adjustments and we move forward.\nPart of moving forward for me is recognizing when I need to take a break and then actually doing it. We tell our kids to let us know when they need a break, but we tend to ignore our own needs. When you have a lot of plates up in the air, it\u2019s hard to justify walking away from them to take a break. But I know I need one, and I know my boys do too. So we\u2019re packing up and heading out. This little clan is going to the coast for the weekend. We\u2019ve rented a\u00a0small cabin right on the beach, and my sister and brother-in-law are joining us. It\u2019s a place we\u2019ve been to before, one we all love, but we haven\u2019t been there for three years. And that\u2019s just too long. Nigel came to me last night at midnight, red-eyed, asking, \u201cMom, are you sure you remember how to get there?\u201d He is so excited; he\u2019s beside himself. This morning he actually said, \u201cI am overzealous about going to White Rock.\u201d He and Aidan have been counting down the days. So that\u2019s how I know \u2013 we all need this. And I shouldn\u2019t have waited so long to do it. So whether it\u2019s trying new medication or taking a break when we need to, I\u2019ve learned not to put it off. I\u2019ve learned not to be afraid. I\u2019m letting the plates fall where they may, and we\u2019re taking off for a few days.

{"date": "February 18, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nIt was back-to-the-grind today, after a 3-day-weekend suspension of reality. Back to school (for Aidan), work (for me), and homeschool (for Nigel and me). And back to Nigel\u2019s hourly teenage lament: Why me?\nIt\u2019s not, as I initially thought, concerning his disdain of having autism/being autistic. At least not yet \u2013 I\u2019m sure that will come up in another year or so. His \u201cwhy me?\u201d does not extend to big-picture malaise at this point. Right now he\u2019s more put out by two things: getting a problem wrong on his schoolwork and having to pick up after himself. And I\u2019ve heard \u201cwhy me\u201d enough times to wonder if it\u2019s\u00a0simply echolalia. He heard it somewhere and he keeps repeating it.\nIn a sense, why me? is typical \u2013 a declaration of universal teenage angst. I distinctly recall moaning it as a teenager when I had to switch high schools in the middle of junior year. Or when I felt a big zit forming (which was far too often). But I wouldn\u2019t question why me? if I missed a homework problem, and especially not about picking up after myself. What is\u00a0up with that? The schoolwork I can understand. It\u2019s not a self-esteem issue with him. He\u2019s not saying \u201cWhy me?\u201d because he thinks he\u2019s not smart enough. He\u2019s saying \u201cWhy me?\u201d because he doesn\u2019t want to do the work over again. He already did it. He hated it the first time. His hand still hurts, and he doesn\u2019t want to do it again.\nWe get the why-me?s in adulthood too, of course. When we get in a car accident or get a speeding ticket. When we lose our job. When a spouse leaves, can\u2019t deal, or dies and we have to raise children alone. When we get cancer. When our child is diagnosed with autism. When we think we\u2019ve accepted the autism but our child\u2019s school has called us at work three times in one week to tell us that our child needs to be picked up because of behavioral issues and so we ask, why me? Why me?\nI\u2019m sure\u00a0that in the mind of\u00a0an autistic fourteen-year-old, his why-me?s are just as valid as an adult\u2019s. Picking up after himself on a daily basis is just like having to do schoolwork over again. He just did it, and now he has to do it again. Why me becomes a refrain, a battle cry even. His autistic mind cannot accept the fact that picking up after ourselves is part of daily life. It is a life in which he craves social interaction, but not society. Not with its standards and expectations. He doesn\u2019t understand why these things must be so, nor does he care. When I maintain that we pick up after ourselves because we are not animals, he retorts, \u201cBut we descended from apes!\u201d I don\u2019t see a way out of this one, even after I point out that not everyone agrees with that theory.\n\u201cThen we should have robots do the picking up,\u201d he says with certainty, convinced that this straightforward idea solves everything and should be implemented immediately. As if it were feasible. \u00a0As if we had a robot just taking up space in the hall closet, and it was a simple matter of just taking it out and turning it on, and it would be programmed to pick things up and put them where they belong. Who are we, the Jetsons? Are we living on the Sci-Fi Channel? Is it 2409?\nI just have one more question.

{"date": "February 19, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tI loved tigers when I was a child. I collected tiger stickers and books about tigers; I lived for Wild Kingdom episodes about tigers. In fact, I still love tigers. In adulthood I\u2019ve acquired two four-foot-long stuffed tigers, various tiger photographs and wall art, and even a tiger tattoo. It\u2019s really the only obsession that\u2019s stayed with me into adulthood. During childhood, I went through various flash-in-the-pan obsessions. I had my rainbow phase, my unicorn phase, my I-must-be-adopted-and-I\u2019m-really-a-long-lost-princess phase. When I was interested in those things, I lived, ate, slept, and breathed them until they ran their course. \u00a0\nBecause of this, I completely understand my son\u2019s Obsessions of the Week. Unlike his lifelong Lego obsession, the Obsessions of the Week\u00a0don\u2019t last too long\u00a0and then fade into the background. They are often revived, and never completely abandoned, but they also never exist with the same intensity as their initial flare. Some are all-but abandoned, meaning that even though Nigel is no longer obsessed with them, he refuses to part with their physical manifestations. Take, for example, his popsicle stick obsession. I always thought that he was keeping them for one of his projects, and when he never made anything, I asked him if we could get rid of them. Noooo! He was saving them because he likes the riddles printed on them. Then there was his acorn obsession. Living in a suburban area and taking many camping and hiking trips on top of that, he accumulated an entire dresser drawer full of acorns over the course of about a year, thanks to a love of Scrat from Ice Age.\nHis other old Obsessions of the Week fall into various categories. He became obsessed with making things that (fortunately in most cases) never materialized: his own Rube Goldberg maze, his own Jurassic Park, a homemade spacecraft, a bomb shelter, and a covered wagon. Many of his obsessions are movie-related: The Goonies, The Terminator, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Dare Devil, Spiderman and Superman, King Kong, Back to the Future. And many others are history-related: World War I and II, the Civil and Revolutionary Wars, the Cold War, Vietnam, Titanic, the Oregon Trail, Clovis people, Ancient Greece, and various natural disasters, especially involving tornados and volcanoes.\nBut, like me with the tigers, Nigel also has obsessions \u2013 besides Lego \u2013 that have stayed with him a remarkably long time. He is a rock collector. We have baskets of rocks of diverse sizes and types all over the house. And sticks. Nigel has a fascination for sticks that I\u2019ve never understood. That and the trash hoarding. He has drawer-fulls of trash in his room. Food wrappers, papers, pieces of plastic, bottles, lids, cans, packaging \u2013 the list goes on. I\u2019m not sure how to deal with this situation. I think that it\u2019s part of his OCD symptoms, but I\u2019ll need to look into it further and discuss it with his doctor. In any case it falls outside of the cute and manageable Obsession of the Week criteria. He also exhibits other compulsions and rituals, like having to do some things in a certain order and needing to somersault down the hallways of the house to get from room to room. Those things don\u2019t concern me too much, but the trash does.\nAnd so I love the easy Obsessions of the Week. Aside from having to put up with a few one-sided, rapid-fire monologues and talk down some unrealistic notions, they are cute and manageable. This week\u2019s obsession can easily be identified by walking through the house and noting things that Nigel has left out in various rooms \u2013 pincushion, scissors, thread. He has been sewing again. He had some leftover pelts from his Chimera project and turned one of them into a furry wallet. He also made a hat for Mrs. Brisby. I always thought she looked cold in that movie. Maybe Nigel thought that too, animal lover that he is. I just thank my lucky stars he\u2019s not one of those kids that brings home all the strays!\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Secret-NIMH-Elizabeth-Hartman/dp/6305161887/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1235024211&sr=1-2"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/02/19/obsessions-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/", "title": "Obsessions: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"},
{"date": "May 5, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\n\u201cBut it itches!\u201d\nThis is often Nigel\u2019s refrain (spoken between clenched teeth) when I discreetly remind him to stop scratching his head. And no, he doesn\u2019t have dandruff. Nor does he have lice, scabies, or any other type of external cause of itching.\nThe head itching started about a year and a half ago, before he began taking either of his two daily medications. Interestingly, it also started right around the same time that the \u201cadjustments\u201d started. By that I mean the \u201csituating\u201d of certain appendages that seem to become jostled throughout the day. Not having the same certain appendages myself, I\u2019m unable to identify with the need for their frequent \u201cadjustments.\u201d Fortunately, my son\u2019s hand remains outside of his clothing when he makes these \u201cadjustments,\u201d but I often have to remind him to go to a bathroom to do it, especially when we\u2019re out in public. Same with the head-scratching.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like to see other people scratching their heads for long periods of time,\u201d I tell my son. \u201cIt\u2019s not socially acceptable. When people see someone scratching endlessly, they think they have lice or some type of skin disease. A quick, occasional scratch is okay,\u201d \u2013 and here, I demonstrate a discreet scratch \u2013 \u00a0\u201cbut not a lengthy, \u2018Bare-Necessities\u2019-type of scratch-fest.\u201d\n\u201cBut it won\u2019t stop itching!\u201d\nInitially I thought that he might have been allergic to the shampoo he had been using, so we switched to a chemical-free, organic shampoo. Then a different one. Then T-Gel. Then we tried various ointments and creams. Heck, we even tried saturating his scalp with organic olive oil for 20 minutes prior to washing his hair, since I had read somewhere that it was a good remedy for itchy scalps. Nothing has worked. Nothing.\nI considered the possibility of a food allergy causing his scalp to itch, but his diet hasn\u2019t changed that much in the past year and a half since the itching started. We already tried the GF/CF diet, but Nigel has never exhibited the gut and digestive issues present with GF/CF allergies, nor did he show any signs of improvement when we tried the diet. It could be something not GF/CF-related, but since his daily diet has not changed much, I have no idea what it could be.\nOne thing\u2019s certain \u2013 the itching started right about the time I realized that he was into puberty. So it could be a result of the hormonal changes he\u2019s experiencing. If that\u2019s the case, how long before his body adjusts? How long before his scalp normalizes and the itching goes away? I had learned last year at the Autism and Puberty seminar that I attended that people with autism are prone to Candida, a type of fungus, which can cause itching. However, that is usually accompanied by gastrointestinal issues and other symptoms. Yet again, I am at a loss for the cause of the itching of Nigel\u2019s scalp.\nSo I\u2019ll just blame puberty. It\u2019s responsible for many other problems we experience around here. And since the average time span of puberty for boys is six years, we\u2019ve got a few more years of rampant scalp-itching to contend with. Any ideas out there other than Baloo\u2019s tree method?

{"date": "May 7, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tThis week Nigel received his mid-term progress report for his first term back at regular school after over a year of homeschooling. He is receiving an F in math, and I am not surprised. What\u2019s that you say? How am I not surprised? Because a few weeks ago we discovered that the entire time I was homeschooling him, I was teaching him out of the wrong book.\nIt all started at his IEP last September, when I requested the school-issued math book so that I could teach him exactly what his peers were learning so that he would be up-to-date when he transitioned back into regular school. I also knew that at the end of eighth grade, this year, this month, actually, there would be benchmark testing for his entire grade, including him, whether he was still homeschooled or not. I wanted him to know what he needed to know. The school\u2019s sped coordinator spoke to Nigel\u2019s previous math teacher at the school, and then he, the sped coordinator, went to pick up the math book and brought it back to the meeting to give to me. I thanked him and was very appreciative that the school complied with my request for the book, since they are not obligated to do so.\nAnd since last September, Nigel and I diligently worked through that book every single day, along with working on the other school subjects. I felt certain that we kept up very well, since we made it two-thirds of the way through the book by March, two-thirds of the way through the school year. When he started back at the middle school that month, initially I was more concerned with how he was doing socially and behaviorally than academically. Things seemed to be going well for the most part, and then it was time for Spring Break. After that, I started asking him how things were going in class, and how he was doing in math. I asked him where they were in the math book, if it was near where we had left off with homeschooling. That\u2019s when he told me. \u201cMom, I found out that was a seventh grade math book we did homeschool with.\u201d\nI wanted to scream. \u201cAre you serious?! Are you sure? It didn\u2019t say seventh grade on it!\u201d\nHe confirmed that was indeed the case. And had I not been so busy with Aidan\u2019s health issues at the time, I would have marched straight into the sped coordinator\u2019s office and let him have it. Or the math teacher who recommended the book. I was angry. I felt like I had wasted Nigel\u2019s and my time and effort and had put him at a great disadvantage for returning to regular school and taking the required benchmark testing. My heart raced and I clenched my fists. I took a deep breath and vowed I would deal with it when I had time. I went home and trundled Aidan off to whatever doctor\u2019s appointment he had.\nA few days later, maybe that weekend, I remembered what I had read around the blogosphere about there being no accidents. Carrie mentioned it, and Jess and Pixie expanded on it. I started to calm down when I thought about that. And then Nigel wanted to rent Kung Fu Panda that weekend, which we hadn\u2019t seen yet, and guess what the theme of that movie is? That\u2019s right \u2013 there are no accidents. The wise old tortoise master says it several times. And I started thinking that maybe I was meant to receive the wrong math book. Maybe I received it because that was what Nigel needed me to teach him, and what he needed to learn. I realized that no one had intentionally given me the wrong book, it was just a mistake, and I was glad I hadn\u2019t stormed into someone\u2019s office threatening to bestow one of Mama Mara\u2019s Ieppie Awards in the Worst Great Idea category.\nAnd so the benchmark tests are in two weeks. It is what is and what will be, will be. I\u2019m not going to get stressed out over it, and I certainly don\u2019t want Nigel to be. His transitional IEP will be coming up soon, and I\u2019ll be sure to diplomatically let everyone know the reason behind his (very) low math grade, without pointing fingers. And if anyone apologizes for giving me the wrong math book, I\u2019ll surprise them by thanking them. Because I learned a lot from this experience. And not just how to divide fractions again.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://fully-caffeinated.blogspot.com/", "http://jesswilson.wordpress.com/2009/03/23/no-accidents-part-two-alternatively-titled-a-really-really-long-post-that-i-cant-seem-to-make-any-shorter-no-matter-how-hard-i-try/", "http://imapixiemama.blogspot.com/2009/03/no-accidents-or-put-your-money-where.html", "http://www.kungfupanda.com/", "http://mamamara.blogspot.com/2009/05/presenting-ieppies.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/05/07/theres-no-f-in-iep/", "title": "There\u2019s No F in IEP"},
{"date": "February 20, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tI confess. When it comes to blogging, I do a lot of lurking, especially when I first discover someone\u2019s blog. I feel like I need to get a sense of the person before I reach out. But I also lurk because sometimes, like when I\u2019m reading about someone who\u2019s just beginning their journey with their autistic child, I become lost in my memories. It\u2019s been nearly twelve years since I began my journey, when\u00a0Nigel was two and a half and I thought, Hmm. He\u2019s not talking. He often doesn\u2019t react when people talk to him. He can\u2019t seem to interact with peers. Autism was the farthest thing from my mind. The child development books I owned barely mentioned the A word. \u201cAutistic children do not show emotion or affection,\u201d they said. \u201cThey live in their own world.\u201d That told me nothing.\nThus began a process of referrals and testing and ultimately a diagnosis that, at the time (1997), confounded me. I went back to Barnes & Noble and found a copy of the DSM IV (first edition), looked up autism, and realized that it was quite different than what I had thought it to be. And I knew then that my son had it. No question. He fit all of the criteria. Every single one. I put the book back on the shelf and went full throttle into his intensive ABA-based therapy. It was certainly gentler than full-on Lovaas (Nigel\u2019s program did not use aversives), but the frequency at the center combined with the home visits proved to be effective and beneficial. Nigel improved, but he did not \u201crecover.\u201d I slowly realized that was not going to happen.\nAnd so, if I had blogged ten years ago, when Nigel was four and a half, I would have written on a daily basis about things very different than what I write now. There would be no Boy Scouts, no Nigelisms. No posts about how well he now does in grocery stores. Ten years ago I would have written about the veritable riots he had in grocery stores, malls, restaurants, while having his hair cut (even at home), and going to the doctor\u2019s office. I would write about how he shrieked and writhed on the floor when I had to take him into public restrooms. How he wailed if anyone even walked past the door where the vacuum cleaner was kept. I would write about how fearful he was of hearing tests, even though I held him on my lap the entire time he screamed, and his traumatic lead testing experience. I would write about my frustration explaining to friends and relatives why he did the things he did. I would write about my joy\u00a0if I found\u00a0a helpful autism book, because there were so few then. I would write about Nigel\u2019s rampant echolalia at age four and a half, how he often tried to use memorized lines from movies and fit them within the context of the real situation. I would write about his hyperlexia, teaching himself to read at age three and a half, before he could talk. I would write about how he greeted\u00a0visiting relatives\u00a0by reciting their license plate numbers instead of saying hello. I would write about PECS cards, visual schedules, home visits, and the dedicated therapists who tirelessly worked with him. There would be talk of the precursor to IEPs, the IFSP (Individualized Family Service Plan) meetings, which we attended every few months. \u00a0\nIf I blogged ten years ago, I would mention my fears that two-and-a-half-year-old Aidan also had autism. He exhibited the same extreme sensory issues as Nigel, and also had a significant language delay. But Aidan made eye contact. He didn\u2019t line up the Hot Wheels cars along the back of the couch and tilt his head while staring at them, as Nigel did. I figured maybe Aidan had a\u00a0touch of\u00a0PDD, but I could see the difference between my boys. Even so, some of Aidan\u2019s sensory issues turned out to be worse than Nigel\u2019s, particularly his oral defensiveness and proprioception. I enrolled him in the same center where Nigel received his therapy, and Aidan received some OT and speech. (He was in speech until he was almost ten, and also had an IEP until then.)\nTen years ago, I would write about just trying to get through the day. At that point, I couldn\u2019t even think about the future. I couldn\u2019t imagine what my boys would be like at twelve and fourteen. I was just so preoccupied with helping them to be as comfortable as possible in this world. And trying to keep my sanity because I was so isolated.\nAnd so, when I read those blogs written by parents of children much younger than mine, I don\u2019t want to come off as a know-it-all when I say this, but I say it with true empathy and understanding: I know what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m there with you. I remember it all. You will get through it and your child will improve. He or she may not be able to do what Nigel or others can do now, but in many ways he or she will progress. Your child will not be the same ten years from now. And neither will you.

{"date": "February 25, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tEvery once in a while I think about the fact that, living in a developed country, we have so many autism resources available to us that are not available in developing countries. And not only resources, but the knowledge itself. The knowledge about autism. We know that it is not the mother\u2019s fault. We know that the child is not possessed by demons. We know it is a neurological disorder and have the resources to obtain necessary therapy, treatment, and education. But others less fortunate do not.\nAnd so I would like to highlight a very special organization, one that I am excited to have found out about, and one that I already feel so passionate about. Knowledge for People is a new non-profit whose focus is to provide \u00a0autism education to families and teachers in developing countries. This is their mission statement:\n\nIn many parts of the world, there is an extremely limited understanding of autism. Many communities and rural villages in developing countries lack adequate resources and are often unaware the disorder exists, even though it is occurring in children and adults around them. People see the symptoms and effects of autism, but often don\u2019t know what is wrong or how to help.\nOur goal is to provide these communities with a greater understanding of autism, its effects, and ways to manage its effects. Through outreach, education, and support, individuals with autism in developing countries around the world will be better understood, accepted, and integrated into their respective communities. Understanding of autism can positively affect families, schools, and the societies as a whole.\nKnowledge for People\u2019s first project is to do an outreach educational program in Nepal this summer. They will be working with parents and teachers to provide basic autism education and also to provide behavioral strategies, sensory ideas, etc. They will also be giving presentations, conducting individual case studies, and possibly doing a radio/TV broadcast. They are looking for volunteers who are knowledgeable about autism to go to Nepal with them, specifically speech and behavioral therapists. If you fall into this category and have the last two weeks of July open, please email: info\u00a0@ knowledgeforpeople.org. They need your help!\nImagine having a child with autism but not knowing what autism is or how to help your child . . . Imagine not having services at school for your child . . . Imagine your child not being accepted into the community because people are unaware of autism . . . These are just a few reasons why Knowledge for People is so important. I hope you\u2019ll join me in supporting them.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://knowledgeforpeople.org/", "http://knowledgeforpeople.org/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/02/25/knowledge-for-people/", "title": "Knowledge for People"},
{"date": "May 3, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tThis week, the greatest number of page views for this site as a result of an internet search was for my recent post centered around Tigger. He\u2019s one\u00a0popular cat, apparently. But the second most\u00a0common search that yielded this website was \u201csigns of teen autism.\u201d I figured that subject warranted a post of its own.\nI thought about it and realized that there would be primarily two groups of people who could be typing in that search:\na) either a parent, relative, or teacher trying to figure out a possible explanation for the different characteristics of their teen\nb) anyone wanting to know how to recognize autism in the teen years, perhaps because they think they\u2019ve come in contact with an ASD teen in their community\nFirst of all, in the teen years, the signs of Asperger\u2019s and high functioning autism are so similar that many people think that there is no difference between the two. Both have much difficulty with social skills (e.g. random, little, or no eye contact while conversing; random, little or no voice inflection; compromised ability to read facial cues and body language), often exhibit reactions to sensory issues (e.g. being easily startled by noises, covering ears; running away from bees and other flying insects), have a great need for routines and rituals, and exhibit obsessions with particular \u201cspecialty interests.\u201d How, then, does one tell the difference between Asperger\u2019s and high functioning autism in teens? The difference lies primarily in the child\u2019s early development of language, although there are other differences as well. In cases of classic \u2013 or Kanner\u2019s \u2013 autism, language development was very late, labored (took many years), or did not occur at all. My son Nigel falls into this category because his language acquisition was quite late and labored. Asperger\u2019s, by comparison, was nicknamed \u201clittle professor syndrome\u201d because the young children observed by Hans Asperger were quite verbal, but they often fixated on certain topics and exhibited some differences in social interaction. Because they can talk, many children with Asperger\u2019s are not diagnosed until later, so the searchers listed above in group a) are most likely trying to identify a teen with Asperger\u2019s.\nFor the group b) people, THANK YOU for wanting to find out. Thank you for caring enough to take the time to do so. We parents of ASD teens truly appreciate you. \u00a0You\u2019ll find some characteristic signs of teen autism listed in bold green in this post (which you probably already figured out, because you\u2019re a smart person for seeking out the information in the first place). You\u2019ll also find some tips for interacting with an ASD teen in my post Getting to Know an Autistic Teen. If you\u2019re looking for signs of autism in teens who are more profoundly autistic, in most cases they will not be mainstreamed in regular school classes, and when they are in the community they will be with a parent or someone else accompanying them. They exhibit little to no speech or echolalic speech. They may also exhibit more reactions to sensory stimuli especially in noisy, crowded places and may make repetitive body movements (spinning, flapping, rocking). Autism manifests itself differently in every person affected by it, so these traits, in addition to those listed in the previous paragraph, may or may not occur and in varying degrees. One thing\u2019s for sure \u2013 you\u2019ll find that people with autism at all functioning levels are wonderful, fascinating individuals worthy of your time, interest, and respect.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer?pagename=life_aspergers", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echolalia"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/05/03/signs-of-teen-autism/", "title": "Signs of Teen Autism"},

That\u2019s the best way I can describe it.\nThis past weekend I attended a gathering of people, mostly autism bloggers, who had participated in helping to raise funds for a service dog for Riley, Michelle O\u2019Neil\u2018s daughter. How powerful it was for me, someone who, less than a year ago, did not personally know anyone who had a child on the autism spectrum.

I could literally feel the strength and solidarity of purpose. We are connected, and not just the people at that table.

{"date": "February 27, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tI\u2019ve done a bit of traveling \u2013 certainly not as much as I\u2019d like, but enough to know not to try to shove a huge carry-on into the overhead compartments of a smaller plane. For that matter, my trip last weekend was a mere overnighter, and my stuff wouldn\u2019t even fill one of the smaller rollers with the telescoping handles. I had three planes to board on the way there, and two on the way back. Five planes in the space of 36 hours. As I boarded plane number three at 5:30 AM, having been on planes or in airports since 6:30 PM the previous evening, I was tired and not in the mood for unsolicited comments.\nI stepped into the plane and began making my way down the aisle, looking for my row, which was near the front that time. It was one of the smaller planes, but I figured I should still be able to fit my pliable bag with a change of clothes and a couple of paperbacks up in the bin. I lifted it up and was surprised to find that I could not wedge it in. I turned it to the side and it still wouldn\u2019t fit. What kind of carry-ons were they expecting people to put up there \u2013 fanny packs?\nI heard a woman\u2019s voice behind me say, \u201cIt seems to be oversized.\u201d\nBefore I even turned around I knew what I wanted to say. My bag was well within the size limits for carry-on luggage. In fact, it was considerably smaller than any other carry-ons I had seen. It didn\u2019t even have wheels! I wanted to say, \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018oversized;\u2019 this compartment is too small! My bag is definitely smaller than anyone else\u2019s carry-on!\u201d\nI turned around and saw a woman who appeared to be in her fifties sitting in her seat across the small aisle from me. And then the non-confrontational tone of her observation hit me, and I somehow knew. It came to me in an instant. She was one of ours. There was nothing else about her that would have \u201cgiven it away.\u201d It was just her tone. My radar kicked in, and I realized that she was merely making an observation. She was not suggesting that I had ignored the size regulations for carry-on luggage. She was not passing any judgments. She was simply commenting on the situation as it appeared to her.\n\u201cI\u2019ll just put it under the seat,\u201d I said as I turned around and sat down. If she responded, I didn\u2019t hear her.\nI watched her a little bit during the flight. She read a book, got up and went to the lavatory once. (\u2018Lavatory\u2019 always sounds funny to me.) Whenever I caught her profile, I didn\u2019t see much emotion on her face, but that tends to be the norm with people traveling alone. There was nothing else about her that could confirm my theory about her neurological status. But her voice, her tone, her choice of words \u2013 that was enough.\nSo as I\u2019m making dinner tonight, I call Nigel in the kitchen to do one of the chores that he alternates with Aidan \u2013 unloading the dishwasher. Usually he balks at it, but he\u2019s compliant this time, probably because I had allowed him to buy a small cat figurine at the store this afternoon. He comes in, begins putting the dishes away, asks me where a strainer goes, and he remembers on his own before I can answer him. Then he holds up the serving spoon that matches the silverware set and turns to me.\n\u201cIt seems to be oversized.\u201d\nYes. He does. He says the same exact words in the same exact tone as the woman on the plane. I feel the hair stand up at the base of my neck. I quickly regain my composure and tell him what it is and where it goes. And then for the second time I am really glad that I hadn\u2019t been argumentative with the woman on the plane. I am glad that I waited that split second for the recognition to dawn on me before I spoke. I am glad that I had just let her make her observation and left it at that. She\u2019d probably had many negative experiences with people yelling at her and correcting her. I know because of my son. I have learned so much from him. Patience, for one. Open-mindedness. \u00a0Compassion. And I\u2019ve learned that I don\u2019t always have to be right. After all, if you look at it logically, my bag was oversized for that compartment.

At least this year, anyway. That\u2019s when he will be starting back at the middle school for the last three months of eighth grade. The details will be hammered out at his IEP meeting early next week, and I am already preparing my arsenal of points and questions for the team. Nigel had initially indicated some interest in attending his IEP meeting for the first time, but when I brought it up with him earlier this week, he had reconsidered. This got me wondering if he is indeed ready, even\u00a0with the new medication.\nWhen I picked him up from his social skills class on Monday, his behavioral therapist told me that he\u2019s been doing really well. He walks around the school with her to pick up the other kids who attend the class, and he is comfortable doing that. Wait. This is Big News. Let me reiterate that. He is now comfortable walking around the school. He has come a long way from how he felt just a few months ago, when I wrote this post in October, which describes his fears and anxieties about being back on campus when his weekly social skills class first started.\nSo as we drove home after class this week, I asked him, \u201cDo you think you\u2019re ready to go back there for two classes a day?\u201d\nAnd this is what he said, in his steady, beautiful voice: \u201cI think I\u2019m ready to go back for a full day.\u201d\nHad I not actually been driving the car, I would have had a much harder time regaining my composure. My son is so brave. And my heart leapt just thinking about his indomitable spirit, after all he has endured. But we\u2019re going to start him off with two classes, just to see how it goes. I\u2019m still so concerned about the bullying. He\u2019ll be thrown in with the same kids, and while I\u2019d like to think that in his fifteen-month absence they might have gained some maturity, I\u2019m not betting on it. But I\u2019m hopeful.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/02/26/new-year-new-behavior-part-5/", "title": "New Year, New Behavior, Part 5"},
{"date": "March 2, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nI realized recently that I hadn\u2019t done a book review in a long time, and since last week I had the privilege of meeting and talking with John Elder Robison, I decided to write a review of Look Me in the Eye.\nThe quote across the top of the cover (actually, the boy\u2019s forehead) says it all: \u201cEndearing . . . Robison is a natural storyteller.\u201d And that is exactly what\u2019s so enjoyable about this book \u2013 his stories are captivating and entertaining. I loved reading about stories ranging from tricks he had played on a teacher who was mean to him and how he raised the money to do so, to how he got started restoring cars and taking radios apart, to how he got interested in guitars and amps and began working on them, which eventually led to his work with KISS. He tells stories about how he met his first girlfriend, how he interacted with his brother while growing up, and dealing with unstable parents. Reflected in all of his stories is a sense of empathy and his longing to connect with others and relate to them.\nMy favorite parts of the book include the chapter describing what it was like for him to be at a huge KISS concert, observing the magic of the lighting system that he designed and built. It\u2019s an incredible passage written with details that made me feel like I was there, experiencing it. Definitely a must-read, along with the empowering chapter in which he figures out the cause of a major problem in one of the electronic toys manufactured by Milton Bradley. I also enjoyed the chapter which features Robison\u2019s analysis of his process to develop socially and emotionally. His insight is remarkable, and anyone \u2013 parents of ASD children or not \u2013 reading his book has much to gain from it. I especially appreciate how he pointed out that child psychologists who observed \u201cJohn prefers to play by himself\u201d were completely wrong. The fact was that he did not know how to play and connect with others, not that he didn\u2019t want to. It\u2019s something that my son also struggled with, and continues to.\nI loved reading about how Robison interacts with and teaches his son, the bond they share, and how he made peace with his parents later in life. The myth that people on the autism spectrum are not emotional is completely blown out of the water with this book. In the Postscript included in the paperback edition, Robison concludes with a plea: \u201cI may look and act pretty strange at times, but deep down I just want to be loved and understood for who and what I am. I want to be accepted as part of society, not an outcast or outsider . . . I wish for empathy and compassion from those around me . . . I hope you\u2019ll keep these thoughts in mind the next time you meet someone who looks or acts a little strange.\u201d I will indeed. In fact, I already have. Look Me in the Eye is a fascinating story of life with Asperger\u2019s \u2013 and being human. I highly recommend it.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://jerobison.blogspot.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Look-Me-Eye-Life-Aspergers/dp/0307396185/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235970841&sr=1-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Look-Me-Eye-Life-Aspergers/dp/0307396185/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235970841&sr=1-1"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/03/02/look-me-in-the-eye-a-review/", "title": "Look Me in the Eye: A Review"},
{"date": "January 18, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve purchased any new furniture. But our old couch, a fourth-generation hand-me-down, was down to threads. The middle sagged like my, um \u2013 well, it just sagged. And even the slipcover that I\u2019d had on it for the past five years was worn and faded. It was time for a new couch.\nSo, after much searching in stores and trying to budget for a brand new one, I found on Craig\u2019s List a beautiful, gently used leather sectional that I love. It\u2019s the same shape as our old one, just a few inches longer on each side. And the price couldn\u2019t be beat. I was so excited about it!\nThen I remembered \u2013 I had better prepare Nigel. Even little transitions like a new piece of furniture are sometimes difficult for him to assimilate. I announced that we would be getting a new couch soon and showed him the photos of it that had been posted on Craig\u2019s List. I pointed out that it was similar in size and shape to the old couch, just different material. I mentioned that I wouldn\u2019t constantly be nagging about the slipcover getting messed up because we wouldn\u2019t need a slipcover. Nigel, not caring in the least about the slipcover, started in with the questioning. Why do we need a new couch? Why can\u2019t we just keep the old one in the game room? Why do we have to get rid of it?\nI couldn\u2019t expect him to understand that because the old couch had belonged to an ex-boyfriend, I really didn\u2019t want to keep it any longer. So I tried to come up with other compelling reasons, but Nigel held his ground. He didn\u2019t want to get rid of the old couch because he had fond memories of watching movies with the ex-boyfriend. I knew then that the only way out of this conundrum would be gradual. He needed time \u2013 time to bond with the new couch and time to let go of the old one.\nSince Nigel is a kinesthetic learner, I figured that one way of helping him to process the new couch would be to have him help with moving it. I brought him with me to go pick it up from the seller\u2019s house, and he enjoyed helping to carry it out and load it on the truck. When we got to our house, he helped to unload it and bring it in. And then he would have nothing to do with it.\nI had pushed the old couch to the back of the room, and that is the one that he sat on. \u201cI have to say goodbye to it,\u201d he told me. And I knew that he would need time to do that, so I scheduled the pick-up for the old couch the following week. \u00a0He sat on it for about an hour, and he insisted on eating his dinner while seated on it. \u201cI have a lot of memories with this couch,\u201d he said wistfully. \u201cYes, honey. We all do,\u201d I confirmed. Then I had an idea.\n\u201cI think tonight we should have our first memory with the new couch. And the old couch will still be here, so it can be the last memory with the old couch, okay? Let\u2019s all watch a movie together tonight. Nigel, you can choose what we watch.\u201d\nSo that night we watched Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Nigel split his viewing time between the old couch and the new couch, doing in-home couch surfing. At the end of the movie, I asked him what he thought of the new couch. He\u00a0mulled it over before answering, and then he said, \u201cWell, I would like it better if it had a fabric cover.\u201d Ah! A sensory issue! I should have thought of that! I suggested that he could cover his side of the couch with a sheet until he gets used to the leather. \u201cBut it\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he conceded. \u201cI don\u2019t mind it.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s how we\u00a0roll \u2013 one couch-surfing transition at a time.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/01/18/couch-surfing/", "title": "Couch Surfing"},
{"date": "January 20, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nI remember the public library near my home where I grew up \u2013 in a suburb twenty miles east of Los Angeles. I felt\u00a0comfortable there, surrounded by books and like-minded people. I loved to go there, whether it was to find a cozy novel or to do research for a report or essay (definitely pre-Internet). When I was fourteen, my parents would drop me off with instructions to be standing out front for pick-up in an hour, which always went by too fast.\nI still love libraries, especially small ones like the one I grew up with and the one in the small southern Oregon town in which I currently reside. Once every two weeks, Nigel and I walk the third-of-a-mile distance from our home to the library. I read magazines while he peruses the juvenile shelves for his favorite book series, Eyewitness, covering topics as varied as the Civil War, Ancient Greece, pirates, knights, and everything in between. After a half an hour, he has made his selections, and we check them out via the self-checkout (which he loves), and then we walk home. Often, since it is a small library, we need to request certain books through the inter-library loan service, and that is what Nigel did last week for the book The Neverending Story. And they called today to let us know that it had arrived.\nI was busy working, trying to meet a deadline, and of course Nigel had to get his book right then. I thought for a second. He is fourteen, he can communicate, and he wants to be independent. He can do this, I thought. I took a deep breath and the words came out as I exhaled: \u201cWould you like to walk to the library to get it yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI can go,\u201d he said, some excitement in his voice. \u201cI know how to get there. I can get the book myself.\u201d He quickly went to put on his shoes and jacket, as if worried that I would change my mind. \u201cI\u2019ll watch for cars,\u201d he added.\nI opened the front door for him as he left. \u201cBe careful,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd come right back after you get the book.\u201d I checked the clock and allotted enough time for him to walk there and back, added a few extra minutes for distraction, and noted what time I should start to worry if he wasn\u2019t back yet. Ha! Start to worry. Like I wasn\u2019t going to worry the entire time he was gone.\nA minute after he left, some idiot on a scooter sped down our 25-mile-per-hour residential street, and I worried about Nigel reacting to the sound, or worse, not getting out of the way fast enough. I worried about him crossing the busier street that the library is on, I worried about someone luring him into their house. I worried about him darting away from bees and other flying insects, I worried about him leaving his library card at the library and having to go back for it (which has happened before, even when I was with him).\nBut these are the baby steps we must take. I would love for my son to at least have a semi-independent life, and I must start fostering that. I must let go a little. I have to trust. I\u2019ve laid the groundwork, and now it\u2019s time for him to test his wings a little. And it\u2019s time for me to let him. I just hope that the idiot on the scooter is long gone when Nigel makes his way back to the nest.\nIt was silly of me to think that I could focus on my work while Nigel was gone. He has gone out on his own before, for bike rides around the neighborhood or to go to a friend\u2019s house, and I worried those times, too. I don\u2019t suppose it will get any easier, especially as he gets older and wants to do even more things independently. And I know that this is something all parents go through to a degree, especially since I have a younger, non-autistic child and go through it with him. But it is different \u2013 they are different. \u00a0They have coping tools and social skills to see them through many situations that Nigel does not, making him far more vulnerable. But I can\u2019t deprive him of the satisfaction of walking to the library himself to check out a book if he is able to. And I believe that he is.\nRight on time, actually early, he walks through the door, book in hand and library card in pocket. \u201cEverything go okay?\u201d I ask. \u201cFine,\u201d he says, and shows me the book. It\u2019s probably the same exchange that took place with my parents when they picked me up at the library all those years ago. And it feels just as good, all these years later.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://us.dk.com/static/cs/us/11/features/eyewitness/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/01/20/wing-check/", "title": "Wing Check"},
{"date": "March 3, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tI like to be prepared and calm when I go into an IEP meeting. So last night after dinner, I sat down with my notepad and jumbled head, full of points to bring up at the meeting, and tried to make sense of them. I planned to spend some time researching topics online, and then I figured I better call Nigel\u2019s dad to go over a few things with him, since he lives 700 miles away and does not attend the IEP meetings. I got up from my desk to go get the phone.\nIt was then that Aidan came and breathlessly informed me that he had pooped blood. Not that there was merely some blood in his poop, but that when he sat on the toilet, almost all that came out was blood. I checked and became alarmed. I grabbed my HealthWise Family Medical Care Handbook and looked up his symptoms. The book said to call a doctor. Then Aidan vomited. I got on the phone and, since it was after office hours, I was told that a nurse would get back to me within the hour. During that time he pooped more blood and vomited again. The nurse called and told me to take him to the hospital. While I was getting things ready to go and giving instructions to Nigel, Aidan pooped more blood and crashed into a wall. We quickly went to the ER, where they hooked him up to an IV, took blood samples, and exclaimed over his high heart rate. They asked about Aidan\u2019s eating habits, so I explained about his oral defensiveness, and the ER doc told me that he didn\u2019t know what that was. He looked at me like I was making it up. They x-rayed Aidan\u2019s stomach. They did a rectal exam (poor kid). I called Nigel every 45 minutes to check up on him, and he said, \u201cI hope Aidan\u2019s okay, because I don\u2019t want to be an only child.\u201d\nFour and a half hours later, we made it home with a bunch of materials with which to collect stool samples. Aidan\u2019s heart rate had normalized and he was no longer pooping blood or vomiting, but his stomach x-ray and blood tests showed nothing, and we had no answers as to what had caused the bleeding. It was one in the morning. I put the boys and myself to bed, now worried about Aidan and unprepared for Nigel\u2019s IEP.\nI awoke realizing that we had all slept through the rest of the night. I checked on Aidan and he was fine; he had also slept through the night with no further episodes. I called his regular doctor to schedule a morning follow-up, as instructed. I called their father, as I had meant to do thirteen hours earlier, and told him about Aidan. No time to go over the IEP. I got Nigel started on homeschooling, then Aidan and I went to see his doctor, sans stool sample. I brought my notepad, and while in the waiting room jotted down some ideas for Nigel\u2019s IEP. Aidan\u2019s doctor didn\u2019t have any news for us, except that it is rare for a twelve-year-old to experience the passage of so much blood in that manner. Thought so. In any case, still no answers until they\u2019re able to do a stool sample, so we\u2019ll work on that. Good times.\nCame home, called their dad back to try to discuss Nigel\u2019s IEP. Got in\u00a0ten minutes of sounding board time. Supportive, but too far away to help. Ran out the door to the meeting, armed with my mantra and my print-out of Mama Mara\u2019s helpful post. Dismayed to discover that the meeting was only scheduled for 45 minutes; it was only to cover scheduling and placement. No time to go over anti-bullying suggestions, nor potential academic concerns. \u00a0Way rushed. Tried to wedge in a mention of Circle of Friends at the end of the meeting, which was met with nods about what a good idea it would be. Like, in the future, when the 1-in-150 crop of ASD kids enters that school. Thanks.\nSo, the IEP was not as successful as I\u2019d hoped. One person can only push so much. Especially when that person has another child with unknown health issues. In all honesty, my mind really wasn\u2019t on the IEP. For now I\u2019ll just have to trust that Nigel\u2019s therapists and teachers, and his new medication, will get him off to a good start next week. In the meantime, I\u2019ve got a few stool samples to collect.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://mamamara.blogspot.com/2009/02/great-expectations.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/03/03/double-duty/", "title": "Double Duty"},
{"date": "January 16, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tI\u2019ve unfortunately been having some dental work done this week \u2013 on myself. And as much as I would rather not be doing it, I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m the one, and not Nigel. As I sat there in the chair this morning, getting my mouth shot up with novocaine and then having my teeth drilled, I wondered how he would handle it.\nI brushed Nigel\u2019s teeth for him until he was six or seven years old. I just didn\u2019t want to risk having him brush his own teeth poorly and getting cavities, which would mean having to take him to the dentist. \u00a0He used to get upset by lawn mowers and leaf blowers that he could hear from three blocks away, so how on earth could he stand a dentist\u2019s drill in his mouth? He shrieked whenever I would try to trim his hair with scissors (because clippers were out of the question), so naturally I dreaded having to take him to the dentist. I figured that if I brushed his teeth for him, he wouldn\u2019t get cavities.\nSo, when he was seven, I had him start brushing his own teeth, because it was time. After about two years of him doing it himself, I noticed that his sound sensitivities seemed to be waning, and I thought that it was probably high time that he saw a dentist and had his teeth checked. I prepared him with social stories, played dentist with him, and promised a reward after the appointment. He seemed ready. I stayed with him the entire time, of course, and notified the dental office ahead of time that he had autism. They were very accommodating, letting Nigel touch the instruments before they placed them in his mouth. I felt like I was holding my breath the entire time, hoping that nothing would upset him. Drills were going in other rooms, and he reacted to them and seemed a little nervous, but I assured him that they wouldn\u2019t be using those on him that day. I was so glad that he was able to filter out the sounds and remain seated in the chair.\nAnd, in fact, he\u2019s never had to have his teeth drilled. Not that day, not ever. Nigel has never had a single cavity, thank God. He\u2019s never had to be restrained to receive shots in his mouth, and he\u2019s never had to try to sit calmly while someone drilled his teeth. I suspect that many autistic kids have had to be sedated to have dental work done on them, and I wonder if Nigel will need that at some point. But we\u2019ll keep our digits crossed \u2013 he\u2019s been to the dentist every year for the past five years, and no cavities. I find that fact astounding considering that he barely has the toothbrush in his mouth for thirty seconds and won\u2019t do it at all unless I remind him.\nI go in next week for my last bit of work, and then I\u2019m done \u2013 with any luck, for good. Maybe I should just start brushing my teeth for thirty seconds \u2013 it seems to work for some people in this house. And anyway,\u00a0as Nigel says, \u201cWho cares about hygiene?\u201d\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/01/16/autism-and-the-dentist/", "title": "Autism and the Dentist"},

{"date": "March 6, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tFor my recent trip involving air travel, Nigel accompanied me to the airport before I left. He flew for the first time three years ago, and he loved it. I had brought ear plugs for him, and he didn\u2019t even use them. He was far too excited and motivated to have mechanical noises bother him that time. He loves to learn about other countries, reads National Geographic every month, and longs for the day when I \u201csell lots of books\u201d so that I can take him to see Stonehenge and the Acropolis, among other places.\nAnd so, he loves to be in airports, which he doesn\u2019t get to do very often. Being an extrovert, he wants to interact with people. I could not have guessed however, that upon entering the airport he would have made a beeline for the guard at the entrance to the security check area. I had my bags and was giving instructions to my mother, who watched the boys that weekend, and I didn\u2019t notice that Nigel had taken off until I scanned the area and saw him leaning in to the guard and saying something. Like a rabbit caught in the headlights, I froze. The guard had an odd look on her face.\nNigel walked back over to me. \u201cI told her to keep up the good work because we don\u2019t want another 9/11,\u201d he said, satisfied with himself.\nHow could he have known? How could he have possibly known that what he\u2019d said was unacceptable talk in an airport? How could I have thought ahead to tell him not to say things like that? I spend at least half my time anticipating inappropriate things that Nigel could say and then explaining to him that it\u2019s not okay to say them. Saying inappropriate things can be a huge problem for\u00a0the verbal autist, even a liability. It can hurt people\u2019s feelings and actually get him in trouble, especially since he rarely makes eye contact and often speaks in monotone. I try to circumvent these potential problems by thinking ahead and coaching him, really trying to understand his way of thinking, anticipating what he might say, and helping him to avoid saying the wrong thing. \u00a0\nI mentally wrung my hands, hoping that we wouldn\u2019t have a security squad swooping down on us at any second. And my heart ached for my poor son who was just trying to make conversation, who absolutely did not mean any harm.\n\u201cOh, honey,\u201d I began, \u201cI know you thought you were trying to encourage the guard, but it\u2019s not okay to talk about 9/11 in airports. It alarms the security guards because they think of it as a threat or a joke, even though I know you didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d\nA dejected look washed over his face. \u201cI thought I was doing something good. I was telling her she was doing a good job.\u201d\n\u201cI know, sweetheart. But they might not see it that way, and it could get you in trouble to talk about 9/11 in airports. So try not to do it anymore.\u201d I looked around, wondering if the guards had their eyes on him. I had to keep him close to me, this boy who is taller than I am. Maybe somehow, if they saw a mother sticking close to her teenage son, they would know. They would see his \u201cdifference,\u201d as he calls it.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said, looking down.\n\u201cI know. I wish I had thought to tell you, but I\u2019m telling you now. I know it\u2019s hard to understand, but you just can\u2019t talk about 9/11 in airports, even for good reasons.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said quietly, seeming to understand, or maybe just accepting it without understanding.\nOh, my son.

{"date": "January 26, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tLet\u2019s be honest: This is hard, this autism business. It\u2019s hard on us. It\u2019s hard on our kids. Those of us who blog have an outlet, a source for venting, and a type of therapy. But we don\u2019t just talk about the hard stuff \u2013 trying to get through the day while worrying about the future. We\u2019ve also been known to mention how rewarding it is to have a child with autism, how fulfilling. There is no doubt that our autistic children have enriched our lives.\nAnd so, with that in mind, I give you my 7 Positive Things about Autism:\n\n1) As special needs parents, we are the most attentive parents around. And that\u2019s a very positive thing. I do believe that if my son were not autistic, I would still be an attentive parent. Of course I would. But the fact is that because he is autistic, I go above and beyond the norm of parenting. It\u2019s harder, and it takes a lot out of us, which would seem like a negative thing. But I\u2019m proud of what we do, the example that we set. I think it\u2019s very positive.\n2) We learn not to take anything for granted. Whether it\u2019s talking, showing empathy, or being able to eat at a restaurant without screaming or writhing on the floor in sensory overload, we notice and appreciate every small step. Because it\u2019s not so small for our kids.\n3) Our ASD kids are unique. They view the world differently, and if we can just be privy to a small part of that, we are indeed blessed.\n4) Nigel\u2019s need for routine helps to keep me more organized. If I already know that we have pizza on Mondays and Fridays, then I don\u2019t have to think about it. Dinner\u2019s already planned two days out of the week. One less thing to deal with.\n5) Autism teaches siblings, relatives, and anyone in contact with our kids \u2013 even ourselves! \u2013 to be more understanding, patient, and more accepting of people who are different. And that\u2019s a very good way to be in this world.\n6) As a writer,\u00a0I get\u00a0some great material because of autism! Whether funny or emotional, I always have entertaining or intriguing topics to discuss.\n7) There is so much to enjoy about our children\u2019s personalities, whether they are verbal or not. My son has a very direct nature, makes interesting echolalic associations and non-verbal mannerisms (even though he is verbal), and is very opinionated. He\u2019s also got some great ideas forming in that ND brain of his. Some ideas are serious, some funny. And for all the difficulties he experiences (and I with him), I can\u2019t imagine him any other way. Believe me, I\u2019ve tried \u2013 it\u2019s a natural thing for parents to do, especially on the hard days. But I think what gets us through are all the little quirky wonderful things that further endear us to the children we love.\n\nPlease add to the list \u2013 what, in your experience, is positive about autism?\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/01/26/7-positive-things-about-autism/", "title": "7 Positive Things about Autism"},
{"date": "March 8, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tSometimes it feels like I\u2019m playing musical chairs with my sons\u2019 sensory issues. I never know which\u00a0issue is not going to be accommodated. When the boys\u00a0were younger, it was like playing musical chairs with ten people and three chairs. Hence, I did not leave the house much.\nAs the years have gone by, both of my sons have learned to filter their sensory input, and most of the issues are no longer as extreme for them. Nigel can go into grocery stores, public restrooms, and restaurants now. Aidan rarely throws up in the car and no longer cries 80% of his waking life. Aidan\u2019s oral defensiveness and tactile sensitivity still affect him, as does Nigel\u2019s sensitive hearing. And so I still tend to write a bit about sensory issues, especially if I\u2019m describing how far they\u2019ve come.\nSince both of my boys have tactile sensitivity, I felt it was quite fitting to be interviewed recently by Soft Clothing. As the mother of two sons who hate socks and wear certain clothes for days on end because they\u2019re the only clothes that \u201cfeel comfortable,\u201d I look forward to trying out their line of seamless socks and tagless shirts, coming later this year. And if you\u2019re interested, click here to check out my interview/blog profile on their site.\nAs for my game of sensory issues musical chairs, we seem to have a new player to add to the mix: light. Nigel\u2019s latest addition to his bedtime routine involves putting on a pair of sunglasses and hiding under his covers before I turn off his bedroom light. He says that the sunglasses \u201cspeed up the darkness level in the eyes,\u201d which I assume refers to his adjustment from light to dark, just as his eyes need to adjust in the morning from dark to light. Of course, I think most of us fall into the latter category. But the adjusting from light to dark is a bit different. Perhaps it\u2019s a transitional thing, and transitions of any kind have always been hard for him. Either that or he\u2019s been listening to that old \u201cSunglasses at Night\u201d song.

{"date": "March 10, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tLately I find myself vacillating between extremes of emotion \u2013 either blissfully happy or sobbing without reason. Infinitely patient or agitated beyond control. Supremely confident or a bundle of nerves. They\u2019re not so much mood swings as what I call \u201coutlook swings.\u201d\nTwo weeks ago, I was on top of the world, and not because of any tangible thing. I was filled with a sense of gratitude for every aspect of my life \u2013 giddy, almost. It was like I was high on gratitude, just for living. It was nice, but it was also unnatural. It was an extreme positive outlook \u2013 so extreme that it had to swing back the other way. My sadness last week came on me like a truck. Granted, I had a lot on my plate with being nervous about Nigel going back to regular school and Aidan\u2019s mystery ailment. But I allowed that anxiety to infect other areas of my life that I needn\u2019t have, like my self-esteem. I suddenly found myself way more negative than I am ever comfortable being. It was the other extreme. Fortunately it subsided with a phone call to a friend.\nSo how else do we\u00a0deal with\u00a0the unavoidable weepy bug? How can we regain our positive outlook when we feel like we have to take on the world (or that the world is taking us on)? My outlook swings have finally normalized (for the time being), and I think it\u2019s because I did all of these things:\n\nI realized that the kids are all right. Yes, one is adjusting to an environment that used to be very difficult for him, but at this moment he is happily watching Winnie the Pooh in his room. And yes, the other one has some unknown health issues that I\u2019m very worried about, but at this moment he is not in pain and he is listening to Bob Marley in his room. These boys are my world. And as long as they\u2019re okay, I can handle whatever is thrown at me.\nI\u2019ve got a job and a home and good health. Yes, this smacks of being told to be thankful for your dinner because there are kids starving in other parts of the world, but sometimes I have to remind myself that my life could be worse.\nI let myself be sad for awhile. There IS a reason for it, even if I can\u2019t see it. And even though my life \u201ccould be worse,\u201d sometimes it\u2019s tough enough to warrant a few frustrated tears. \u00a0And everyone always has a right to feel the way they do. So if you\u2019re sad, own it. You do have a reason, and it is valid.\nI called a friend. Let me say that again, because it\u2019s not something I normally do. I called a friend. Usually I\u2019m a go-it-alone person. I often have to force myself to ask for help. I don\u2019t know why; it\u2019s just the way I am. Maybe because I\u2019ve been on my own for so long, I\u2019ve had to be that way, even when the chips were down. But not this time. I felt the need to talk it out, and it helped immensely.\nI recited affirmations. Nigel is calm and comfortable at school. Aidan\u2019s body is healing. I am working toward my goals. My life is right on schedule. I enjoy life. I am where I am supposed to be.* I recite these in my mind throughout my day, and before I go to sleep. It\u2019s also helpful to write them on Post-It notes and stick them around the house where you will see them periodically (bathroom mirror, refrigerator, wine rack).\n\n*Note: Affirmations are generally not as effective when you\u2019re in the middle of a crying jag.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://kyraanderson.wordpress.com/2009/03/10/when-in-doubt-itemize/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/03/10/5-ways-to-feel-positive/", "title": "5 Ways to Feel Positive"},

Dishes were washed, showers were taken, lunches were made (we shower and pack lunches the night before), and homework was checked. I walked back through the house, ready to\u00a0return to working in my office, and I did my nightly perimeter check, shutting off lights and checking doors. A bunch of Lego and string cheese wrappers greeted me in the living room.\n\u201cNigel,\u201d I said as I walked\u00a0by his room, \u201cwhy haven\u2019t you picked up your stuff in the living room yet?\u201d\nHis response: \u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m making a Chimera?\u201d\nSome of you may recall about two months ago when Nigel removed the stuffing of several of his stuffed animals and collected the stuffing in a bag with the\u00a0plan of making something else at a later date. I figured that this bag of stuffing, like many of his well-intentioned projects, would sit around forever and nothing would actually ever come of it. Over Winter Break, while he was at his dad\u2019s house, I considered getting rid of it before he spread it all over the floor. His room is messy enough already. But for some reason I didn\u2019t throw out the bag of stuffing.\nAnd as I entered his room that night to try to ascertain what the hell he was doing, I saw the bag of stuffing on the floor, and the stuffing was profusely billowing out of it. Nigel was on his bed with one of his stuffed animal carcasses in one hand and a threaded needle in the other. He was sewing.\nNigel has done some sewing before, since a few years ago I taught him how to sew his Boy Scout patches onto his uniform. He has also sewn \u201cbear hands\u201d (gloves made from a previously stuffed bear) of his own design, and a few other minor projects. But his Chimera was quite an undertaking. He combined the body of a lion with a wolf\u2019s head coming out of the back and an eagle\u2019s head coming out of the chest, sewed them together, and then restuffed the body.

Turn and face the strange changes . . .\u201d\nNigel and I have some big changes ahead of us. It\u2019s been a year since I began homeschooling him, and just when I started to feel like I was doing okay with it, Nigel announced that he wants to go back to regular school. I\u2019m not too surprised, actually. He is a social, extroverted person, autism notwithstanding, and even though he\u2019s been involved in Scouts and has other social outlets, he\u2019s reaching his limit of being home with Mom. And it\u2019s showing in his lack of compliance with doing his schoolwork. It\u2019s been increasingly difficult to get him to focus, to gauge if he\u2019s learning anything,\u00a0and if he is, whether it\u2019s going to stay with him. His thoughts are always elsewhere.\nI never expected to homeschool him for very long. Hell, I never expected to homeschool him at all until it became necessary! I had never even entertained the thought. I never thought I was the homeschooling \u201ctype,\u201d whatever I thought that meant. I guess I thought it meant people who really wanted to homeschool their children for religious reasons \u2013 or any reason, for that matter. But once I realized that he needed it, a) because things were so bad at school that he asked me to, and b) because bussing him to a contained classroom in a different city was not acceptable to me, then I wanted to do it. Then I began to wrap my mind around it and come up with ways to make it happen. It was probably one of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve faced as a single parent \u2013 making drastic work changes, schedule changes, and financial changes. I put so much mental energy into just getting used to the idea of homeschooling. Then I had to research what I was supposed to teach him, how to do it, and plan. It required a lot of focus to convince myself that I could do it.\nIt\u2019s not over yet, of course, not for a while. The first step will be to see his doctor again, since we have decided to try some new medication to help with his behavior and need to get started with that. Then we need to attend his IEP (Nigel has requested, for the first time, to attend his IEP meeting, which is huge) to discuss what his options are. Most likely he will attend two classes in the morning and then come home, so he will be half-homeschooled. We\u2019ll do this for spring term, and if all goes well, in the fall when he starts high school (gulp), he may be able to attend full-time with some support.\nSo, we\u2019re making adjustments. It reminds me of when he was younger and he attended three different elementary schools before we found the right fit \u2013 we constantly made adjustments. We are no strangers to change. Part of me is feeling defeated \u2013 I had to work myself up to doing this in the first place (homeschooling), and now it is winding down. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m throwing in the towel. We\u2019re just making adjustments. Trying to find the right fit again. I have to believe that we will.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/01/29/changes/", "title": "Changes"},
{"date": "February 1, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nWe all know that music soothes the so-called savage beast, but it can do much more than that.\u00a0 I have written before about how beneficial music has been for Nigel, including helping him to sleep better. So in December, for Autism Twitter Day (organized by Bonnie of Autism Family Adventures), I was excited to win a new therapeutic music CD. And the results of listening to it have been pretty wonderful.\nAdvanced Brain Technologies has created The Listening Program as a type of Auditory Integration Training/therapy. The program, first available in 1999, consists of audio CDs containing psychoacoustically modified classical music designed to stimulate the different functions of the auditory processing system. This is accomplished by carefully selecting compositions which include varied orchestration, tempo, octave, meter, etc. Post-production techniques involve filtration, audio bursting, blending, spatial dynamics, audio morphing, and more. Case studies demonstrating the positive outcomes with ASD kids using this program are available here.\nOr, you can just read this case study: In the past two weeks since Nigel began listening to Music for Thinking before going to bed, not only has he slept better, I have seen noticeable improvement in two other areas. According to Advanced Brain, researchers have made a link between the middle ear and social engagement that provides insight into why some ASD individuals may demonstrate behaviors and communication difficulties in certain situations and environments. I hadn\u2019t yet made that connection when I wrote about Nigel recently wanting to go back to regular school to be with his peers and the fact that he did so well at a Boy Scout function last week. But it makes sense now, after reading the detailed literature included with the CD.\nThe other area in which I notice improvement is in his schoolwork. He is frustrated because he wants to go back to regular school, and his attitude reflects that. However, the quality of his work has improved, as well as\u00a0his ability to organize his thoughts. Just last week he wrote a three-paragraph essay about one of his Scout camping trips. It was well-organized, full of wonderful details, and included a conclusion listing all the things he learned on the trip. We had worked so long and painstakingly on his writing skills, starting less than a year ago with his first fledgling paragraph. To see him go from a labored few sentences to a beautiful, well-planned and well-written three-paragraph essay, well, I\u2019m filled with such pride and emotion that I can\u2019t even describe it. \u00a0I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that he was able to do this after listening to Music for Thinking for two weeks. I\u2019m a firm believer, and we\u2019ll definitely be trying more CDs!\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismfamiily.blogspot.com/", "http://advancedbrain.com/", "http://www.thelisteningprogram.com/", "http://www.thelisteningprogram.com/results.asp", "http://www.abtmedia.com/products_shs_thinking.asp", "http://advancedbrain.com/", "http://www.abtmedia.com/products_shs_thinking.asp"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/02/01/music-for-thinking/", "title": "Music for Thinking"},
{"date": "December 16, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tNigel recently accompanied me to a large, busy grocery store, a smorgasbord of sensory issue hell. In recent years, I haven\u2019t thought about it much \u2013 we just go and do our thing. We come home, Nigel helps bring in the bags from the car, I unpack. Seeing us now, one would never guess that, years ago, going to the grocery store with my son was not such an easy task. In fact, it was a nightmare.\nHe was about a month old when I first took him to the grocery store with me. \u201cWow,\u201d I thought as he slept on my chest. \u201cHe\u2019s loving this.\u201d Within eighteen months, that was not the case. The baby who slept on my chest became the toddler who screamed and writhed on the floor. After a few of those incidents, I decided to leave him home with his dad when I went grocery shopping. Of course, that was not always possible. Once I had to run out for a few essentials and had Aidan on my hip and Nigel pulling on my arm. Nigel was about three years old. The sounds and the lights tortured him. I quickly grabbed the few things I needed and went up to the check stand, thankful that there was only one person ahead of us. Suddenly, someone in the customer service booth right next to us turned on an electric coffee grinder. Nigel began shrieking and sobbing and trying to bolt. It was horrible. Of course, Aidan joined in. Somehow I managed to keep Nigel from running away. Shaking, with both kids still crying, I paid for our items, and we emotionally limped back to the car.\nI did not take him in any more stores for several years after that. His dad and I were divorced, but for a while he still lived in our area, and he would have the boys two nights a week, so I did grocery shopping then. When Nigel was seven, his dad moved 700 miles away, but fortunately I had a boyfriend then who would stay with the boys while I ran my errands. That lasted until five years ago, when Nigel was nine. At that point, he could actually sit for a while in a restaurant, so I figured I could try taking him to the store again. I had to, because there was no one to stay home with him.\nI was nervous, remembering all the screaming and writhing on the floor. And I was nervous because I didn\u2019t know what my options were if it was still going to happen. We prepared using a homemade social story about going to the grocery store. I made rules, such as \u201chold onto the cart and stay with Mom.\u201d And I promised rewards. If you are quiet in the store and stay with Mom, you can pick out a treat. And you know what? The planets aligned and Nigel did okay. He covered his ears a lot, but at least he knew to do that. It took him a few years to learn how.\nAbout a year ago I decided that if I put on a movie for him that I could leave Nigel and Aidan home alone for an hour while I ran errands. My cell number was posted by the phone, and we practiced them calling me or a neighbor if anything happened. And I got used to them not going to grocery stores with me most of the time.\nLast week, Nigel came with me because he had a gift card to use at a different store that was nearby. First we went to the grocery store. As Nigel calmly walked beside me through the entrance, I was suddenly thrown back to the days of sensory issue hell. It struck me how vastly different it is for him now. I have read about autistic adults who have vivid memories of their childhood and how agonizing their sensory issues were, and I wondered if Nigel remembered those old grocery store experiences. I described for him how he had been, reminded him of the time with the coffee grinder, and gently asked him if he remembered any of that.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d He even sounded a little surprised.\nPart of me wonders if it\u2019s a case of him subconsciously blocking those memories because they were so traumatic, which is something that members of our family are known to do. Or maybe he just cannot access memories from before he was verbal. I know that I can\u2019t remember anything before I started talking. In a way, I wish Nigel could remember his early years because I would love to hear his perspective on them now. That would be simply amazing. But it\u2019s probably good that he can\u2019t remember those painful times, for his sake. It\u2019s enough that I remember them and can feel so fortunate that somehow he learned to filter the bombardment of sensory input, and now he can participate in so much more of our life. Even if it\u2019s just a trip to the grocery store.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/12/16/nigel-vs-grocery-store/", "title": "Nigel Vs. Grocery Store"},

I have been fortunate to get to know many families who live with autism. And I appreciate this connection so much.

{"date": "December 17, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tI\u2019ve never seen The Seven Year Itch (although at some point, I\u2019d like to). The phrase, according to Wikipedia, \u201crefers to a disinterest in a monogamous relationship after seven years of marriage, has entered the popular culture, and has even been used by psychologists.\u201d And now it will be used by the mother of an autistic teen, with an entirely different meaning.\nAs my son entered his second year of teenhood, which was just a couple of months ago, I began noticing something. Over the course of a few weeks\u2019 worth of seemingly isolated incidents, I realized that Nigel, who had always been notorious for the eternally flat tone in his voice (except when angry), was suddenly speaking with inflection. And not just random variations \u2013 he actually put appropriate emphasis on the right words. His tone was starting to sound conversational! It took another week or two of me pointedly observing him talk and noting the increase of his inflection before I allowed myself to believe it. This is truly a developmental coup. It\u2019s a milestone for the five-year-old boy who, when a child psychiatrist asked, could not say his own name. It\u2019s a milestone for the boy who, for so many years, could only parrot lines from Disney movies or Scooby-Doo cartoons when he wanted to interact with people. He has worked so hard to achieve this.\nI know that much of the increase in voice inflection has to do with the weekly social skills class that he is enrolled in at the local middle school this year. It\u2019s a very small class, with only two other students, but I know that the two instructors have been specifically working with Nigel on his conversational skills. Whatever they\u2019re doing \u2013 it\u2019s effective. And he\u2019s responding to it, which tells me that he\u2019s ready. It\u2019s time.\nWhat do I mean by that? That\u2019s where my seven-year-itch theory comes into play. Over the years, I have noticed that every seven years Nigel seems to make a huge leap in various areas of his development. It\u2019s like he has this really significant itch every seven years, and when he scratches it, he hits a milestone. For example, when he was two, his sensory issues were so severe that he had to wear a fitted hooded jacket whenever we left the house to muffle sounds and help him feel secure. When he was nine, he had a wonderful regular ed teacher (he was mainstreamed that year with an aide) who not only taught him a lot academically, he patiently encouraged Nigel to remove his hood for the first time. That was also the year that I could take Nigel into grocery stores and the occasional restaurant. Another example of his seven-year-itch is in the cognitive area. When he was three, he taught himself to read,\u00a0but I was told that it was common for young children with hyperlexia\u00a0to not\u00a0comprehend most of what they read. Seven years later, when Nigel was ten and reading at a high school level, his comprehension was tested. It was estimated that he understood about 95% of what he was reading.\nWhen Nigel was seven, seven years ago, he really started talking. He had some speech prior to that year, but it was mostly echolalia and scripting (a term which wasn\u2019t used much then). He would occasionally string up to four words together to communicate, but he had trouble with syntax and pronouns, verb tenses, etc. When he was seven, something clicked. He got an itch. He started stringing together more than four words spontaneously, his syntax and verb tenses began improving, and his echolalia decreased. It was remarkable. Of course, his tone was characteristically flat and downright stoic, but that was okay. It was definitely okay with me. \u00a0I figured he would always talk that way, and that was fine.\nAnd now, seven years later, the inflection surfaces. On appropriate words, even. I am so loving this \u2013 this unexpected gift. Some seven-year-itches can be good.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_year_itch"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/12/17/the-seven-year-itch/", "title": "The Seven Year Itch"},
{"date": "December 18, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tI\u2019ve written before about Nigel\u2019s quest for friendship and his need to be social. He has been fortunate to meet some patient and friendly NT kids through his involvement in Scouting. Continuing with the What It\u2019s Like series, I wanted to highlight a couple of\u00a0his friends\u00a0and ask them a few questions. They are brothers; the older one is Nigel\u2019s age, and the younger one is Aidan\u2019s age. Here are their combined responses:\n1) How long have you known Nigel? \u00a03 years; 7 years\n2) What have you heard or been told about autism?\u00a0 That just because they have autism doesn\u2019t mean they are stupid. In fact, in some ways they can be smarter than normal.\n3) What\u2019s it like hanging out with Nigel?\u00a0 It\u2019s always fun; awesome \u2013 he\u2019s super smart.\n4) What ways have you noticed Nigel acting differently?\u00a0 He gets up close to your face (not all the time).\n5) When you\u2019ve witnessed Nigel have what\u2019s called a \u201cmeltdown\u201d \u2013 become upset about something \u2013 how does that make you feel?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It makes me feel sad; sad and guilty.\n6) Have you ever witnessed other kids giving him a hard time or bothering him?\u00a0\u00a0 Yes; yes, many times.\n7) What\u2019s the most difficult part about having an autistic friend?\u00a0\u00a0 Getting him to understand; not to get frustrated with him when you want to say something and he keeps cutting you off.\n8)\u00a0What do you like about having an autistic friend?\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019s super smart and has a great imagination \u2013 super fun to play with; it\u2019s never boring!\n9) Any advice you would like to mention for other kids who might meet someone with autism, or anything else you\u2019d like to add?\u00a0\u00a0 Be patient!\nA big thank you to Nicholas and Tyler! I appreciate your time in answering my questions, but I appreciate you so much more for being such good friends to Nigel (and Aidan). Our family is very fortunate to know yours.

{"date": "December 21, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tMy younger son Aidan, who is twelve, has recently discovered Bob Marley. He found one of my CDs from my college days (when I first discovered Bob) and it was love at first listen. Aidan plays it day and night. He tells me that he likes the music, but also the lyrics. And I\u2019ve noticed that, too. Aidan seems even calmer and more introspective than usual. What I hadn\u2019t noticed was that Nigel had also started listening.\nLast weekend the boys were very excited because The Day the Earth Stood Still was opening. They had recently seen the original and looked forward to comparing the new one to it. I told them that we\u2019d wait until the following weekend so it wouldn\u2019t be so crowded. Then I made the fatal mistake of writing on the calendar the day and time I hoped that I could take them to see it. \u00a0If it\u2019s on the calendar, it\u2019s in stone as far as Nigel is concerned. It\u2019s going to happen. And usually, it does. But that morning the schools had scheduled an emergency 2-hour late start due to bad road conditions, and that threw everything off for the day. Because Aidan started school two hours later, I couldn\u2019t go into work until two hours later. Consequently, I didn\u2019t finish my work until two hours later than I normally do. By the time I got home, I could not do all I needed to do in time to go to the movies that evening, and we would go the following day, I announced.\nNigel got upset. \u201cBut it\u2019s on the calendar!\u201d he yelled and began breathing heavily through clenched teeth, eyes wild as he quickly went into meltdown mode. This was not good. I had plans with a friend later that evening (something I had planned to do after the movie), and if Nigel didn\u2019t calm down, I wouldn\u2019t be able to leave him. I tried reminding him about \u201cOld Plan, New Plan.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThat doesn\u2019t work!\u201d he yelled. He then took a wooden ruler and mutilated a piece of pizza with it. I could tell he was escalating. He went to the living room and broke one of my hand-painted pysanky eggs from relatives in Slovakia. I knew that my response was crucial \u2013 he wanted a reaction out of me, so I did not react. I calmly said, \u201cNigel, pick up those broken pieces and put them in the trash.\u201d And I think he was a little surprised that I didn\u2019t yell at him about the egg, so he actually cleaned it up. He resumed his verbal tirade, but at least he stopped being destructive. Then I had an idea. An alternative for him. It was a \u201cNew Plan,\u201d but I didn\u2019t want to call it that.\nIt was risky, because I didn\u2019t want him to think that I was rewarding him for his behavior. But what I hoped to accomplish was to help motivate him to regulate his behavior himself. Some would call it a bribe. But God knows that when you have to change plans on an autistic teen, you better have an acceptable back-up plan.\nI sat him down and tried to look into his wild eyes. \u201cNigel, here are your choices. You can be mad about not going to see the movie tonight, but that\u2019s not going to make it happen. Or, you can calm down and come with me to the store to pick out a video rental and get some ice cream, and we\u2019ll see The Day the Earth Stood Still tomorrow.\u201d Then I got up and went to my room to get my boots and coat.\nAidan followed me into my room. He looked at me. \u201cWhy does he act that way?\u201d he asked with concern and sadness in his voice. \u201cHoney, it\u2019s because the autism makes it hard for him to regulate his emotions and his behavior.\u201d\n\u201cThen how is he going to take care of himself when he\u2019s an adult?\u201d Aidan asked in a sincere voice.\nA chill ran through my body. I looked at him. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he will. But he\u2019s learning; he\u2019s trying. I think he\u2019ll figure it out. And he can live with me as long as he needs to. So can you.\u201d\nI put my arm around him and we walked out into the hallway. Nigel was standing by the front door, with his shoes and coat on. I looked at his face, and the wildness was gone, replaced by a look that I couldn\u2019t determine. Remorse? Gratitude? Maybe both. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get my purse and keys,\u201d I said. As I walked off, I heard Aidan quietly say to him, \u201cI\u2019m glad you were able to calm down.\u201d And my heart filled with far too many emotions to identify.\nA moment later, as I started the car, Nigel asked from the back seat, \u201cCan we listen to \u2018Don\u2019t Worry About a Thing\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018Three Little Birds,'\u201d Aidan said.\n\u201cSure,\u201d I said, inserting the CD. And then we all sang, even Nigel:\nDon\u2019t worry . . . about a thing . . . \u2018cause every little thing . . . gonna be all right . . .\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/12/21/thinking-ahead/", "title": "Thinking Ahead"},
{"date": "February 4, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tThis is a hard post to write. I\u2019m even struggling with how to begin. But it\u2019s something that\u2019s been on my mind for a long time, and I want to address it.\nMonths ago, I had a little free time (ha!), and I was surfing around looking at T-shirts on Caf\u00e9 Press. I found one that I really loved, that I thought I just had to get for Nigel. It said \u201cAutistic and Proud.\u201d I got a lump in my throat just looking at it online, just thinking about how proud I am of my son\u00a0and how hard he works to \u201cbe like everybody else,\u201d as he puts it. I\u2019m proud of how far he\u2019s come, from his days of screaming due to sensory issues and not being able to talk. I think he\u2019s wonderful, and so is every other person on the spectrum. Because all of them are trying so hard just to function in this noisy, bright, busy, often intolerant world of ours.\nMy moment of pride only lasted a few seconds \u2013 and then I remembered that the pride is mine. Nigel \u2013 and this is hard to write \u2013 is not proud of being autistic. No matter how I applaud his efforts, no matter how often I tell him that he\u2019s got a really great brain, no matter how many times I tell him it\u2019s okay to have autism. Here\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s not okay with him. Nigel has a non-acceptance of his autism. Certainly not denial \u2013 he knows it, he accepts that it\u2019s part of him. He doesn\u2019t refute it. But he hates it; he even says, \u201cThis stupid autism! I want to rip it out of my head\u201d because of his negative social experiences in the past few years. I try to encourage him, tell him the autism is part of what makes him the fascinating person that he is. That I\u2019ll help him as much as I can with the difficult parts. I know that having the diagnosis is good because it helps him to know the \u2018why\u2019 of his behavior and the challenges he faces. Maybe later the self-acceptance will come. I hope it does. Because I hate to see him berate himself and blame the autism and have him wish that it wasn\u2019t a part of him.\nBut I don\u2019t know how to help him get to that point of self-acceptance, other than to just keep doing what I\u2019m doing. It just makes me so very sad. This is one of those hard things. When they respond well to therapy and learn to talk and adapt to their severe sensory issues so that you can actually take them out in public \u2013 when and if they can do all of that, autism is still there, making things hard. I think I wrote my recent \u201cpositive\u201d post because I just needed a break from the negative. Because I know I\u2019m not the only one in the house experiencing the negative. It changes over the years \u2013 but it never goes away.\nAnd maybe that\u2019s why Nigel feels the way he does about autism. He lives with it; he knows some of what it means for him, and most of it has been negative. I try to point out positive things for him \u2013 he learned to read at age three (before he could talk, even), he\u2019s very good with maps, he remembers historical facts easily. And that\u2019s all well and good. But at the end of the day, when you\u2019re fourteen and you just want to be like everybody else, I guess it\u2019s hard to be \u2018autistic and proud.\u2019 I just hope, with all of my motherly heart, that he\u2019ll get there someday.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/02/04/pride-and-self-prejudice/", "title": "Pride and Self-Prejudice"},
{"date": "February 3, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tI am thirty-eight today. And rather than discussing anything else with that number (revolver cartridges or bands), I\u2019ll write about something more important to me.\nWhen I turned twenty-two, I was in college, scrambling to finish in one more year, working full time and taking eighteen credits a term. It was nuts. I don\u2019t know how I stayed on top of it. I realize now, of course, the if-I-knew-then-what-I-know-now, that it was nothing\u00a0like the issues that came with having special needs kids, the single parenting, the working, the just-trying-to-get-through-the-day. But I certainly wouldn\u2019t say that working my way through college was a cakewalk compared to parenting. At the time, it was a lot. It would be a lot at any age. And I\u2019m sure glad it\u2019s behind me.\nSo on my twenty-second birthday, I got up early, went to class, came home, worked on a paper, then went to my job as a clerk at a large chain drugstore. I walked into the back to clock in, and my boss called me into her office. \u201cI see it\u2019s your birthday today,\u201d she said. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d When I told her, she waved me off and said, \u201cAw, you\u2019re a baby!\u201d I walked out of there thinking, Hmm. How old do you have to be to get some respect? 25? 30? 40? I thought at that stage of the game, working my way through college, I\u2019d earned at least a little of it. \u00a0\nAnd now, sixteen years and a degree, a divorce, two kids, and a house later, I think I know what she meant. I feel like calling up that old boss, or walking into her office, and saying, \u201cI\u2019m 38 today. Am I there yet?\u201d I\u2019d like to think so. Because I finally realized that she was right. I didn\u2019t get it at the time. I didn\u2019t understand that it isn\u2019t how busy we are or how old we are that earns us respect. It\u2019s who we are. \u201cThirty-eight\u201d might precede \u201cSpecial\u201d if you\u2019re a band or a gun, but me? I\u2019m singing with Aretha.

{"date": "February 10, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tThe day starts off as such a beautiful, clear day \u2013 sunny and almost warm. I decide to ask Nigel to accompany me to the grocery store to pick out a different cereal in addition to what he usually has every morning. He agrees. We walk in the store, side by side, and head over to the organic produce section. \u201cWhere are the coconuts?\u201d he asks. I tell him that they are probably in the regular fruit section and point him in the general direction.\nHe walks over by himself, and I watch. Not because I think I need to, but because, once again, I marvel at his ability to filter all the sensory input that used to be agonizing for him. The luxury of this \u2013 to me \u2013 never wears off. The sheer joy of it. It is comforting to see that he is happy, not distressed in the least. His gait is confident, purposeful. I look down and pick out some broccoli. In a moment I look up and see Nigel, fifty feet away from me, across produce stands and people and carts, and he is standing there looking at me, a big smile on his face \u2013 eye contact, even. He has found the coconuts. I smile at him, too, for so many reasons. He comes back over to me and asks if he can have a coconut so that he can make a replacement for one of his shell-cloppers from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. He likes to clip-clop his way through the house, acting out scenes from the movie. He made a pair of cloppers about a year ago, and one broke. Of course I will let him get a new coconut, but I ask how much they cost because I want him to be aware of things like that. He briskly walks back over to check. \u201cTwo dollars,\u201d he says. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d\u00a0 Sometimes he is so cute. I assure him that it\u2019s fine, then suggest he go pick out his cereal. He returns a moment later with his completely appropriate, healthy choice (no, I\u2019m not being sarcastic \u2013 he has learned not to bother asking for anything with refined sugar, after years of being turned down). He then asks if he can look at toys \u2013 not to buy, he assures me, just look. I tell him okay, but be back in five minutes.\nHe returns as I am unloading my cart at the check stand, exactly five minutes later, brandishing a small Lego kit that he has somehow not yet acquired. He tries to bargain. \u201cI\u2019ll have this instead of the coconut,\u201d he says as he picks up the coconut to return it. I gently remind him that he promised he was only going to look at the toys and not buy any. A blank look crosses his face as he remembers. \u201cBut it has a crystal wand,\u201d he says in a small voice. \u201cMaybe some other time,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting toys today.\u201d He reluctantly says okay and goes to put the Lego back. And as I finish unloading my groceries, I marvel yet again at this child who has come so far, who, as a teen, is doing little things on his own. \u201cLook, Ma \u2013 no hands\u201d for us translates to \u201cLook, Ma \u2013 no sensory issues.\u201d \u00a0Or, \u201cLook, Ma \u2013 no meltdown.\u201d Of course, he doesn\u2019t say that, but I\u2019m thinking it. And his sensory issues are far from gone; he has just learned to filter them and cope with them. He still needs earplugs in movie theaters and often covers his ears, is a very picky eater, and exhibits some sensitivity to light and touch, but overall he does quite well now. He also knows when he needs to diplomatically settle for a coconut over Lego, and maybe, deep down he appreciates the subtle reminder that that was what he wanted in the first place.\nWe walk out to the car and the weather has drastically changed in the half hour that we had been in the store. The sky is dark gray and the snow is blowing at us horizontally. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s snowing!\u201d Nigel exclaims with perfect inflection. We hurry out to the car and he stands by his door, waiting to be let in. I ask him to help me load the groceries and he complies. As I put in the last bag, I hope for a second that he has thought to put the empty cart in the stall without me asking him to, but he is back waiting to get in his door, and the cart is still next to me. There will be other teachable moments, when the sun is shining.\nI put the cart away and run back to the car. We get in and Nigel pulls the coconut out from underneath his jacket. \u201cAt least I protected the coconut from this climate,\u201d he says. I tell him that it looks like a perfect one for his project. I look at the windshield wipers flicking away the snowflakes as I drive home. I breathe in sharply and feel overwhelmed with gratitude for so many things. That smile, for one thing,\u00a0when he found the coconuts \u2013 it was just for me, and I will treasure it always.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_python_holy_grail"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/02/10/look-ma-no-hands/", "title": "Look, Ma \u2013 No Hands"},

{"date": "February 6, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tI\u2019ve seen this floating around Facebook lately and have decided to post\u00a0mine here:\n1. WHERE DO YOU CURRENTLY LIVE?\nOregon, USA\n2. WHAT IS YOUR CHILD\u2019S NAME, AGE AND DX?\nNigel, age 14, Autism\n3. WAS YOUR CHILD PROPERLY DIAGNOSED?\nYes, twice. First time right when he turned 3, and again at age 5, for insurance purposes.\n4. WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU FIRST LEARNED YOUR CHILD HAD AUTISM?\nI was confused. Back in 97, when he was first diagnosed, all the information I had on autism was archaic. It said that autistic children sat in a corner and rocked themselves all day long. Nigel did not do that. But I quickly came to understand that autism manifests itself in many ways.\n5. WHAT IS THE HARDEST THING ABOUT HAVING A CHILD WITH ASD?\nThe ignorance of the general public, and the bullying my son has endured. When he was younger, Nigel would have screaming meltdowns in grocery stores, public restrooms, etc. because he was in agony due to his sensory issues. People usually glared at us or made comments about \u201ccontrolling\u201d him. Also see #18 below. This is one reason why I blog about autism.\nThe hardest thing for my son has been the bullying. He has endured so much from mean, uncaring kids. And when he tries to defend himself, he ends up getting in trouble. I ended up homeschooling him because of the bullying and his anxiety that resulted from it.\n6. WHAT IS THE BEST THING?\nMy son has an amazing mind and an engaging personality. Anyone who takes the time to get to know him \u2013 and to be patient with him \u2013 likes and appreciates him.\n7. HAVE YOU TRIED THE DIET AND DID IT WORK?\nAssuming this refers to GF/CF, yes, we tried it. Nigel does not seem to have the gut issues that others with autism have, so it didn\u2019t work for him.\n8. WHAT ABOUT OTHER BIOMED TREATMENTS- HBOT, CHELATION, ETC.?\nThe thought of chelation scares me, and I\u2019m not familiar with HBOT.\n9. WHAT METHOD OF ABA/Behavior Therapy DO YOU LIKE BEST?\nNigel had modified ABA-based therapy (and OT and speech) from the ages of 3 to 6, 4-5 days a week with two weekly home visits. We were fortunate that he had a positive response. I believe that is a key factor in how he is able to function today. After that, he continued with speech and some behavioral therapy over the years.\n10. IF YOU COULD MAKE EVERY PARENT TRY ONE THING- WHAT WOULD IT BE?\nTry not to be bitter. Sometimes, like when they smear blood from a bloody nose all over a room, or when you just have to pick up some milk at the grocery store and they\u2019re screaming and bolting, or when they\u00a0burn\u00a0holes\u00a0in the couch using a magnifying glass, or when the school has called you for the third time this week because of behavioral issues, or when you\u2019re worried about their future, it\u2019s really hard not to be bitter. We didn\u2019t ask for this. No one does. But being bitter won\u2019t help you; it just builds up and makes you feel worse. It took me a while to figure that out.\n11. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE RATE OF AUTISM REALLY IS?\nNo idea \u2013 I try not to dwell on statistics too much.\n12. HOW MANY KIDS WITH AUTISM LIVE ON YOUR BLOCK?\nJust mine.\n13. HAVE YOU EVER MET A RECOVERED CHILD?\nNo. It\u2019s not a mental illness. It\u2019s a different neurology, a different way of processing.\n14. WHAT KIND OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM DOES YOUR CHILD GET?\nNigel is currently homeschooled for the past year, but we are in the process of having him go back to mainstreaming part-time.\n15. DO YOU GET SERVICES/TREATMENTS THROUGH YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE?\nsome\n16. DO YOU THINK THE DIVORCE RATE IS REALLY 80% FOR ASD FAMILIES?\nPossibly. I\u2019m divorced, but\u00a0not because of the autism.\n17. DO YOU HAVE A GOOD POOP STORY?\nWith his sensitive olfactory glands, Nigel never sought to do much with his poop except flush it. Prior to toilet training, he touched it once, and apparently that was enough. Blood, on the other hand, is a different story.\n18. WHAT IS THE STUPIDEST THING ANYONE HAS EVER SAID ABOUT YOUR CHILD?\nA co-worker of mine once said to me, \u201cHaving an autistic child must be easy.\u201d I thought she was being sarcastic, maybe, but I asked, \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d She answered, \u201cBecause they\u2019re so quiet.\u201d I tried very hard to be calm as I said, \u201cJust because some of them can\u2019t talk does not mean they\u2019re quiet!\u201d\n19. WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN SOMEONE ASKS \u201cWHAT IS AUTISM?\u201d\nI talk about the spectrum, that it\u2019s neurological, that the jury\u2019s still out on the causes, and I talk about how it affects Nigel.\n20. WHO IS YOUR \u201cAUTISM COMMUNITY HERO\u201d?\nI have said before that siblings are the unsung heroes of autism. I am so proud of my younger son Aidan and what he has experienced with having an autistic older brother. Please read about him here. And here\u2019s another\u00a0wonderful sibling. I\u2019m sure there are many more. All of them have my love and admiration.\n21. WHAT GROUP/ORGANIZATION DO YOU THINK HAS DONE THE MOST FOR THE COMMUNITY?\nNot sure if this question refers to my own community or the autism community at large, but I am glad to be a Chapter Rep for the Autism Society of Oregon. They host many helpful seminars and awareness events, and I\u2019m proud to be a part of it.\n22. DID YOU VACCINATE YOUR CHILD AND DO YOU CONTINUE TO DO SO?\nYes, I did. Fourteen years ago\u00a0most people didn\u2019t question vaccination. But I continued to vaccinate him, because God forbid he contracts meningitis.\n23. DOES YOUR FAMILY ACCEPT YOUR CHILD HAVING AUTISM?\nYes, they have been very supportive and loving. I am blessed.\n24. WHAT LESSON HAVE YOU LEARNED AFTER ALL OF THIS?\nI\u2019ve learned that there\u2019s still so much more to learn, and to do. Certain challenges can change with time and therapy, but other challenges take their place. And we\u2019ll face them.\nI\u2019ve learned that even though sustained bitterness is detrimental, it\u2019s okay to be sad sometimes. We\u2019re human, after all. All of us. And we\u2019re just doing the best that we can.\nI\u2019ve also learned that patience and a sense of humor and an occasional glass of wine will help immensely.\n25. IF YOU COULD GO BACK IN TIME. WOULD YOU CHOOSE FOR YOUR CHILD TO BE NEURO-TYPICAL?\nIf I had answered this questionnaire years ago, when it was so hard just to get through the day, I might have said Yes. Now, I say No. I can\u2019t imagine\u00a0Nigel any other way. But I think, after all\u00a0these years,\u00a0that\u00a0even if\u00a0he had not learned to filter his sensory issues and started talking, at this point I still wouldn\u2019t want to change him. People with neurological differences are amazing regardless of their functioning level.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://jesswilson.wordpress.com/2008/12/18/magic-wand/", "http://oregonautism.com/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/02/06/25-things-about-autism/", "title": "25 Things about Autism"},

A week from today I have to do it again to go and pick them up.\nIn my lifetime, especially in adulthood, I have spent probably hundreds of hours and logged in thousands of miles on Interstate-5, \u201cI-5,\u201d the West Coast artery that connects the three states between Canada and Mexico. It passes through Los Angeles, Sacramento, Portland, and Seattle, among many other cities, for a total of 1375 miles. The landscape transforms from stretches of coastline into the urban sprawl of major cities, from flat agricultural areas into the higher altitudes of the Cascade and Siskiyou mountain ranges and the lush green of Washington. It connects millions of families spread out along its reach. Many of them were headed back home yesterday after Christmas gatherings. It was a bit crowded.\nI was struck by the universal experience of it all \u2013 the traveling to see loved ones, the returning home afterward. I envisioned other families parting with hugs and well-wishes of safe driving, just as I hugged my kids there in the parking lot of the Carl\u2019s Jr. before we got back in our cars and drove off in separate directions. We all experience these partings in varying degrees.\nBefore Nigel got in his dad\u2019s car to leave, I hugged him and reminded him to watch for cars backing out of driveways when he goes for walks in his dad\u2019s neighborhood. \u00a0\u201cI know,\u201d he said, but without his usual exasperated tone. Then he briefly made eye contact and said, \u201cI love you, Mom.\u201d\nShakespeare said it best \u2013 parting is such sweet sorrow.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/12/27/the-drive/", "title": "The Drive"},
{"date": "December 30, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tRemember when it was called Christmas Vacation? It amuses me that even what we call our seasonal time off must conform to political correctness. But that\u2019s okay. I actually prefer the name change, especially since I\u2019ve been teaching this year, and I realize how essential a break really is.\nOne of the most common internet searches that points people to this website is \u201chomeschooling autistic teenager.\u201d I know this not just because my blog software tells me, but because I\u2019ve typed that search myself. And I still do. I keep hoping that someone out there will have figured out the ins and outs of homeschooling autistic teens. And if they already have, I haven\u2019t yet discovered their words of wisdom.\nWinter Break gives me a chance to do a lot of things in addition to taking a break from teaching. I catch up on other work, like the work I do that actually generates some income (can\u2019t let that slide!), I clean the house a bit, I try to visit with friends and family members who may be wondering if I\u2019ve dropped off the face of the earth, and I make plans for the next school term. I have been homeschooling my autistic teenager for nearly a year now, and this is what I\u2019ve learned.\n\nHomeschooled autistic teens function best with a written schedule. We went without a written schedule for one term, and we won\u2019t be doing that again. Not having a written schedule opens the door for numerous motivation and focusing issues.\nVerbal autistic teens will debate with you the merit of any subject that they are not interested in learning. In fact, they will debate the necessity of formal education in general. They will demand to live how they want to live. This does not just happen occasionally. It happens every day. Yes \u2013 every single day without fail. You know that saying about the patience of a saint? It ain\u2019t me. So I have learned to leave the room for a moment to get my bearings and remember that even though he is verbal, it doesn\u2019t mean that I can reason with him. It doesn\u2019t mean that even if we\u2019ve already discussed the importance of education three days in a row that he won\u2019t ask the same question tomorrow.\nAutistic teens are individuals and have their own particular learning styles. My son is a visual-kinesthetic learner. I have taught him division by taking a pile of almonds and grouping\u00a0it into sets of three to show how a number goes into another number. For years while he was mainstreamed he never understood this concept because math is not typically taught that way. I have also taught him how to\u00a0multiply fractions by writing out the steps for him to visually refer to.\nAutistic teens may need \u201ccrutches\u201d to help with some concepts. I have used question marks in place of letter variables when teaching algebra to my son. After he learned how to solve the equations, he no longer needed to substitute the question marks in place of the letters.\nWhat works one week may not work the next. Not only do you have to \u201cthink outside the box,\u201d you have to reinvent the proverbial wheel on a regular basis. Inspired moments like teaching division with almonds won\u2019t always produce the same \u201ca-ha!\u201d results when applied to other concepts. The almonds, however, do come in handy if you get hungry.\nHomeschooling an autistic teen will stretch you \u2013 your mind, in coming up with innovative ways to reach someone who thinks differently and often simply does not want to learn; your patience, in dealing with the daily debates and the frustration of going over the same concept for weeks; and of course, your heart. Nothing else I\u2019ve ever done is more of a labor of love than this. \u00a0\n\nSo take Winter Break, Spring Break, and Summer Break. In fact, take Friday Break also. Keep up your strength and safeguard your sanity. Take whatever breaks you can, when you can. Take Christmas Vacation, Halloween Rest, Easter Time-Out. Relax, regroup, rediscover. And then restart.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/12/30/winter-break/", "title": "Winter Break"},

Not at all. We\u2019d like it just fine if you can keep things mellow.\nI suppose I should define \u2018mellow.\u2019 You see, in a house where autism resides, we already have a lot happening on a day-to-day basis. We have a 14-year-old autistic boy who learned to talk but has trouble regulating emotions and behavior, navigating social interactions, dealing with sensory integration, and understanding the purpose of education and how it relates to him. We have his mother who is trying to homeschool him and work two jobs and manages to write something, cook something, and clean the house every now and then. We also have his sensitive 12-year-old brother who is figuring out his place in all of this.\nSo by \u2018mellow,\u2019 I mean that we don\u2019t need people getting lost or hurt, trees catching on fire, pets getting hit by cars, computers and \u2013 heaven forbid, the Xbox 360 \u2013 crashing, furnaces going out, or bouts of food poisoning. We don\u2019t need any more loved ones dealing with cancer or getting in car accidents. You might be thinking that I\u2019m being negative or critical of 2008, but I don\u2019t mean to be. 2008 was in many ways a positive year, with some big forward strides, and we learned a lot. We are more resilient and capable. All things considered, we are happy.\nAnd we\u2019re looking forward to a great next year of life \u2013 a year full of goal achievement (including a graduation), enriching experiences (including a problem-free trip to the Grand Canyon), and even a new nephew/cousin!

{"date": "January 4, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tOften at the start of a new year, we note things that we would like to change about ourselves or our lives. We make resolutions and take steps to lose weight, be healthier, save money, or achieve a goal. \u00a0We are determined to improve.\nYesterday, I began preparing Nigel for his doctor appointment at the end of this week. He tends to detest these medication-management appointments, being asked to rate his mood, and answer other questions that he would rather not. So I thought that I\u2019d prepare him a few days ahead of time, asking him some of the questions that I recall the doctor asking previously, so that Nigel can start thinking about his answers. \u201cHow would you rate your mood?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cFine,\u201d he answered as usual. Then he added, \u201cBut I don\u2019t see any changes.\u201d\nSurprised and intrigued at this part about \u201cchanges,\u201d I pressed further. \u201cWhat changes are you hoping to see?\u201d\n\u201cMy behavior. I want to not get angry so much so that I can go back to regular school.\u201d\nAnd my heart thumped as I understood what I had always wondered. Even though Nigel is much calmer with homeschooling than with mainstreaming, he is an extroverted autist, and he misses being in a more social environment. Even though he is regularly involved in Boy Scouts and attends a weekly social skills class, it\u2019s not enough for him. He craves more. The sad part in all of this is that, because of his autism, he usually can\u2019t handle more. It is very difficult for him to regulate his behavior and emotions. He is learning, but I\u2019m hoping there is some medication that can help him with this. He has been on Zoloft to help with his OCD symptoms and anxiety, and that has been beneficial. I explained to him that the medication that he\u2019s been on is not designed to help with behavior modification, but that there might be medication available that can help with that. One of his problems is that when kids do or say something to purposely agitate or upset him, he blows up, and he\u2019s not able to regulate himself. Then he ends up getting in trouble, and it becomes a vicious cycle, because it\u2019s fun for the bullies to upset him. Suggesting to him that he \u201cignore\u201d them does not work for him. He is not able to ignore them (in my opinion, they should not be doing it in the first place, but that is another issue).\nI don\u2019t know if there is a type of medication that can help him with his behavior. We\u2019ll be discussing it with his doctor, but if any readers have any suggestions, please let me know. I\u2019d love to have Nigel be able to attend the local public school, at least part-time, because it would mean so much to him. His new year\u2019s resolution is to go back, and I want to help him achieve that goal.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/01/04/new-year-new-behavior/", "title": "New Year, New Behavior"},
{"date": "January 5, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tWhen Nigel was first diagnosed at age three, and for some time after, he didn\u2019t know how to play with toys. I bought him a kids\u2019 train set; he laid his head to one side and stared at the tracks. He had no interest in pushing the train along, even if I showed him how. I bought him Hot Wheels cars and tried to teach him to \u201cvroom\u201d them around on the floor; he lined them up end-to-end along the back of the couch and cocked his head to one side to stare at them. I feared that his imagination would never develop; eleven years ago my only knowledge of autistic adults was, unfortunately, limited to Rain Man. I didn\u2019t know what to expect for my son\u2019s development.\nBut, thanks to a successful response to a modified ABA-based program for early intervention, and perhaps his own desire, Nigel learned to play with toys. He skipped over \u201cvrooming\u201d on the floor and went right to faster-paced, battery-operated Hot Wheels tracks. His imagination began developing with his desire to feed his stuffed animals. And then he discovered Lego.\nI cannot say enough wonderful things about this toy that I loved in my own childhood. Yes, we\u2019ve all gouged our feet on errant pieces and cursed its existence, but the fact is that no other toy has encouraged Nigel\u2019s imagination to develop as much as Lego has. And for that, I love it.\nAnd we have tubs of it. Literally. We progressed from a medium-sized tub to two of them, and then I just up and bought a huge industrial-sized tub with a hinged lid, which is now full. And still Nigel begs for more, especially since they\u2019ve come out with the Indiana Jones series. Oh, my son. Be still, his heart. Lego and Indiana Jones \u2013 two of his favorite things. That\u2019s all he wanted for Christmas. It\u2019s like the Lego people somehow knew that this combination would make an autistic teen very, very happy.\nSo I bought him the sets that he wanted, as well as this book that he has not let out of his sight. Of course he has re-watched all four of the movies several more times since Christmas, just to make sure that he has all the nuances of every line down pat. And so, when he decided to watch the Troy DVD this afternoon, I was pleasantly surprised. \u201cI\u2019m studying the layout of the outer walls of Troy so that I can take apart the Temple of the Crystal Skull set and build Troy,\u201d he told me.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is what he did. He constructed the ancient city of Troy out of Lego, completely off the top of his head and of his own design. He built a wall with a ratcheted gate and levers to open it. Yes, he even built a Trojan Horse out of Lego. That is either one hell of a toy or one hell of an imagination. He\u2019s come a long way from lining up Hot Wheels cars along the back of the couch and staring at them. And Rain Man? No offense, but you can keep your cards and toothpicks. Nigel\u2019s got an imagination \u2013 and he\u2019s not afraid to use it.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Indiana-Jones-Ultimate-DK-Publishing/dp/0756635004/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1231216515&sr=1-2", "http://www.amazon.com/Troy-Two-Disc-Widescreen-Brad-Pitt/dp/B0002Z0EYK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1231216603&sr=1-2", "http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Product.aspx?p=7627&cn=536&d=519"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/01/05/ode-to-lego/", "title": "Ode to Lego"},
{"date": "January 6, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tThat nasty stomach-bug thing that\u2019s been going around has made its way to our house. Right before bed last night, Nigel ran to the bathroom to throw up. I thought at first that it was because (I\u2019d discovered) he drank way too much soda that afternoon and evening while I was working in my office. But typically if\u00a0his stomach\u2019s upset for that reason, it\u2019s a one-time elimination deal. And, unfortunately, Nigel\u2019s trips to the bathroom occurred several more times throughout the night.\nUsually, he makes it on time, but at one point in the wee hours, I heard him (the sound at which all parents groan) and went to check on him. It wasn\u2019t pretty. I cleaned him up, got him back in bed and reminded him about using the old pot that I\u2019d put by his side for the next episode, and then cleaned up the carpeted hallway, the bathroom door, sink, mirror, and floor. I didn\u2019t even want to know what time it was.\nNigel has always been a trooper when it comes to being sick. Even as a young child it didn\u2019t seem to faze him. He never whined about being sick \u2013 he just took it. He\u2019s still the same way. And he loves saltine crackers, which I only buy when the kids are sick. I think it\u2019s like a consolation prize in his mind \u2013 he requested the saltine crackers moments after he vomited his entire dinner. Not yet, I told him. Your stomach needs to rest. I\u2019ll get you some tomorrow. And he accepted that. His stomach probably made him sense that it was best to wait.\nFortunately, though,\u00a0our family\u00a0doesn\u2019t get sick much, especially in recent years. Two and a half years ago, we started eating organic food. Not everything \u2013 in fact, probably about half of the food we consume is organic \u2013 the stuff that we eat every day. But it really makes a difference in our health. In two and a half years, both boys have only been sick twice, and it was mild \u2013 over in two days. I\u2019ve only been sick once, also mildly.\nBut still, even in my children\u2019s teen years, I\u2019m cleaning up puke. At some ungodly hour, no less. Afterward, I manage to get a little sleep. In the morning I get up and get Aidan off to school, check on Nigel, empty and clean out his used pot, wash my hands, and come in the office to work. Suddenly I hear retching sounds in the hallway right outside my office door. It\u2019s one of the cats, about to yak on the carpet. I leap up from my desk and grab the poor thing, herding him into the bathroom and holding him over the linoleum. Then I clean that up, laughing at the fact that I have cleaned more puke in the last nine hours than I have in the past four years. I wash my hands for about the thirtieth time, put on my shoes and coat, and go out to buy non-organic saltine crackers. And maybe a new mop.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/01/06/sick-bay/", "title": "Sick Bay"},
{"date": "January 9, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\tThe term \u201cself-medicate\u201d has a negative connotation. \u00a0It makes me think of alcoholics or drug addicts, both prescription and illegal. Yet, taken literally, the two words simply mean to administer medicine to oneself. Or to want to.\nNigel and I saw his doctor \u2013 his psychiatrist \u2013 today. He goes in every couple of months for his \u201cmed-management\u201d appointment. He doesn\u2019t like these appointments because he doesn\u2019t like answering questions about himself (really, he only likes answering questions about Indiana Jones, or Lego, or the JFK assassination, or either of the World Wars). And even though I prepared him ahead of time, reminding him that the doctor is required to ask these questions and that he could write the answers down if he didn\u2019t want to say them (\u201cWhy would I want to write anything, which would cause pain to my hand?!!\u201d), he still got impatient with the questions and often sneered his answers. Or instead of actual answers, he would sneer \u2013 in reply to \u201cHow would you rate your mood today?\u201d \u2013 \u201cSame as it was last time!!\u201d\nThis level of verbal hostility probably encouraged the doctor to nod in agreement when I indicated to her Nigel\u2019s desire for some medication that would help him to not blow up at certain peers of his who think that it\u2019s fun to antagonize him. He wants something to control his tendency to respond in anger because he wants to go back to being mainstreamed. And he knows that that is his most difficult hurdle. Not because anyone told him, but because he actually has the self-awareness to see it. Yet, he does not have the ability to control his reactions to people when they upset him. So, he wants medication. He knows that medication helped him to stop habitually pulling out his hair and eating it, so he figures that medication can help with his behavioral issues. He wants to self-medicate.\nAnd I had done my research and knew what the doctor would suggest: antipsychotics. There\u2019s another negative connotation. Is that really what he needs? Are the occasional times that he blows up worth putting him on a daily medication with significant side effects? I asked him, there in the doctor\u2019s office, gently, \u201cI know that some of the kids bothered you every day, but did you respond with anger every day?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Every day.\u201d\nI took a deep breath and tried to let what he\u2019d said sink in. It was too difficult to imagine, again, what he went through at school, day after day, and to think that in spite of that, he still wants to go back. He wants to be like everybody else. \u00a0It means that much to him. But I still wasn\u2019t ready to say yes to antipsychotics. So I suggested that he try behavioral therapy to learn different responses when his peers anger him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see more psychiatrists,\u201d he said, right there in the doctor\u2019s office. \u201cThey\u2019ll do the same kind of treatment!\u201d\nHis psychiatrist smirked as she wrote that down. I asked, \u201cWhat kind of treatment are you expecting from the psychiatrists?\u201d\n\u201cAsking me questions!\u201d And, of course, the psychiatrist politely laughed.\nBut the issue was still hanging over my head. He wants to change his behavior but he can\u2019t handle therapy sessions. So, the doctor went and got several pages\u2019 worth of printed material for me on the two medications she suggested as possibilities (Risperdal and Abilify). She gave me her cell number if I wanted to discuss anything with her. And I left feeling just as unsure and melancholic as when I\u2019d arrived.\nRight now Nigel is sitting on the couch in the living room, watching The Never-Ending Story III, which he was excited to rent tonight. Most of the time, I hear the faint sounds of the TV, which he keeps at a low volume, but once in a while he makes stim-type sounds or repeats one of the lines of the movie. He is happy; he is doing his thing. And he is not on antipsychotics. I wish it could always be that way.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2009/01/09/to-med-or-not-to-med/", "title": "To Med or Not to Med"},

One point in particular that I keep thinking about was from Maddy\u2019s post, in which she mentioned that someone had found her blog by searching \u201cmethods to stop echolalia.\u201d Yes, it can be annoying sometimes, and maybe completely random, but hey! Your child is talking. Do you get it? Why would you want to stop that?\nI have written about Nigel\u2019s language development through various stages of echolalia. Yes, there have been times in recent years when I have prompted him to use his own words instead of a memorized phrase to communicate, but that\u2019s because I know that he now has the ability to do that, to use his own words. Echolalia is comforting to him, however, and he reverts to that in high-stress situations. And in those situations, it\u2019s more important to help him to calm down than to stop the echolalia. I don\u2019t tell him \u201cYou can use your own words\u201d when he\u2019s on the verge of a meltdown. But sometimes, when he\u2019s calm and comfortable, I encourage him to rephrase whatever he\u2019s saying. I\u2019ll gently suggest, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to say things from videos right now. Try to tell me in your own words.\u201d And he does now, because he\u2019s able to. But I\u00a0would never want to take that part of him away completely. He\u2019s said some really funny things because of his delayed echolalia (scripting)! It\u2019s how he learned to talk, and for that reason, I\u2019m sentimental about it.\nWhy on earth, when a brave child is venturing into the speaking realm, would someone want to stop echolalia? Let them do it! Let them practice! When someone is learning to play the piano, there is a lot of bothersome plinking and plunking going on, usually on a daily basis.

{"date": "December 1, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tThere\u2019s a saying in the autism community that you\u2019re probably familiar with. \u201cIf you\u2019ve met one child with autism, you\u2019ve met one child with autism.\u201d This loosely translates to \u201cWhen an autistic teen doesn\u2019t like math, he really doesn\u2019t like math.\u201d And neither do I, making it an arduous task to teach it to him. After trying to teach him long division and triple-digit multiplication late last year, I finally said, \u201cOh, look! A calculator!\u201d and the two of us were much happier. That is until this year, when we got to algebra.\nI tried to explain to my son as he gently banged his head on the kitchen table that if he wanted to attend the local public high school at some point (which he has indicated that he does), he would need to learn algebra. A simple equation like 2c + 1 = 7 would send him into a tirade: This is an outrage! Letters do not belong in math!\nAfter explaining to him that the letters are called variables and they symbolize numbers that we need to figure out by solving the equation, an idea came to me. As we sat on the couch together with the dreaded math book in front of us, I suggested to Nigel that we substitute a question mark for the variables. In other words, 2c + 1 = 7 would become 2? + 1 = 7. I could actually feel Nigel calming down as soon as I rewrote the equations. And it worked. He listened to my instructions and he could solve the equations.\nThe drawback to this, of course, would be when we got to two variables within the same equation: 2x + y = 7. I started to think that we could use other symbols besides question marks, like an asterisk. Then I thought, okay, maybe the question mark is just a crutch, just something that will help him to understand the concept of variables so that he can learn how to solve the equations, and after a while he won\u2019t need to substitute ? for c or x.\nFollowing our local public school calendar, which\u00a0gave all of last week off for conferences and Thanksgiving, we homeschoolers also\u00a0took last week off. Today we got out the math book, Nigel groaned, and I turned to a new chapter, one that started working with two variables in the equations. We started working one together, and I wrote it out just as it was in the book: y = 2x + 8. Nigel did not ask about the question mark. He did not yell about letters not belonging in math. The question mark had been just a crutch, one that he quickly could do without. But he still reminds me every day that he doesn\u2019t like math at all. \u201cJust humor me,\u201d I tell him, and then I explain what that means.\nOn a side note, I just discovered this article, Reaching an Autistic Teen, that I loved and wanted to share. It\u2019s about a special school in\u00a0Decatur, Georgia for autistic teenage boys. Be sure to check out the last page \u2013 there\u2019s a bit about one of the boys wanting to build a \u201cmagic cabinet,\u201d and it reminded me so much of something Nigel would want to do. I absolutely loved it.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/magazine/19Autism-t.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=education"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/12/01/when-autism-does-not-equal-liking-math/", "title": "When Autism Does Not Equal Liking Math"},
{"date": "December 7, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tM at Incipient Turvy, one of the blogs I love and read regularly, recently commented on my stuffed animal post. The thought of him searching strange word combinations to try to find Teen Autism gave me an idea for a new series of posts: \u00a0Sunday Searches. Each week I\u2019ll write a post about a search that was used to find this website. I\u2019ve already got a list going from months ago. Some are funny, some are serious. And some of them are really worth discussing.\nHere\u2019s this week\u2019s search: \u201cautistic teen does not want to drive a car\u201d\nFirst off, that\u2019s probably a good thing. I wish Nigel hadn\u2019t started talking about wanting to drive. I\u2019m fine with him driving go-karts, but about a year ago, he started talking about when he turns sixteen and gets his driver\u2019s license. Like he\u2019s assuming it\u2019s going to happen. Two years from now? I don\u2019t think so. He gets distracted enough while just walking down the street, let alone operating a moving vehicle down the street. He has this idea in his head that if he can physically drive the car and knows the mechanics of it that he should be able to have his license. About six months ago, he reached in the glove box and pulled out the car manual and said, \u201cI need to start studying this so that I can get my driver\u2019s license when I\u2019m sixteen.\u201d Fortunately we were still in the driveway or I might have driven off the road in sheer panic.\nOf course, there are autistic adults who drive. Temple Grandin, who drives, has said this about the subject: \u201cI think it\u2019s difficult for many people on the autism spectrum to drive because there is so much going on at the same time and so much to pay attention to at once.\u00a0 For people on the spectrum who want to drive, I recommend a full year of driving on easy roads with no traffic before venturing out on freeways and busy intersections.\u00a0 Once you don\u2019t have to think about steering, braking or pushing on the gas, it\u2019s much easier to multitask on busy roads.\u201d\nI suppose that when\u00a0Nigel\u2019s emotional age catches up, I might consider letting him learn to drive. His current emotional age is about eight, even though cognitively he is at or above his actual grade level. So since he\u2019s about six years behind emotionally, I figure that in about seven or eight years he will reach the emotional age of 16 (when he\u2019s in his early twenties). Then we\u2019ll look at his sensory processing, his maturity, and we\u2019ll entertain the idea of him possibly getting his driver\u2019s license. Until then, go-karting will have to do. And I\u2019ll just keep wishing that our local Family Fun Center offered frequent driver rates.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://http://incipientturvy.blogspot.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Grandin"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/12/07/to-drive-or-not-to-drive/", "title": "To Drive or Not to Drive"},
{"date": "December 3, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tSomeone found this website yesterday by searching \u201cautism + stuffed animals,\u201d and I am not surprised. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve previously made several references to Nigel having stuffed animals (yes, I just checked \u2013 mentioned in general on three posts), but I\u2019ve never written about how attached he really is to them. And, I would venture to guess, he\u2019s not alone in that.\nI bought him his first stuffed animal when he was in utero. It was a 15-inchTigger, and he still has it, fourteen years later. A good portion of the stuffed animals he has amassed over the years are specific characters, including Kermit, Simba, ET, Gizmo, Mrs. Brisby from The Secret of Nimh (made with love by Grandma), Otis from Milo & Otis, Harry Potter (yes, a stuffed Harry Potter), and Kuzco in llama form (from The Emperor\u2019s New Groove). Nigel also has a\u00a0plethora of non-specific stuffed wild animals, including two bald eagles (one 18 inches, one 6), a fox, a wolf, a squirrel, an otter, a capuchin monkey, a mountain lion, a coyote, a bison, a tiger, a mammoth, and at least a dozen bears. The boy loves bears. In fact, he loves all of his stuffed animals. He loves them so much that every year when we attempt to purge his room of things that he has \u201coutgrown,\u201d he refuses to give up any of them.\nAnd so we keep adding to the collection. After all, the Tigger prompted him to do the first imaginative thing he\u2019d ever done. I still remember the shock and joy I felt as he held Tigger at the kitchen table with him and put Tigger\u2019s face in his bowl of frozen corn niblets, pretending to feed him. He even said, \u201cEat,\u201d in his little voice. He was four years old. I\u2019ll never get rid of Tigger. He has earned a place of honor in our home.\nNigel\u2019s stuffed animals have also been his friends. He has acted out stories with them, talked about emotions with them, and generally been comforted by them. They have helped him to sleep and helped him to feel less lonely. So imagine my surprise when I walked into his room a few weeks ago and discovered that several of the non-specific stuffed wild animals had been gutted. He had removed their stuffing and left all the carcasses\u00a0strewn across\u00a0the floor of his room. I noticed that he had put all the stuffing in a soft, knit bag and pulled the drawstring closed. Curious, I asked, \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d\n\u201cSo I could make something bigger, and it would have the\u00a0good stuffing of animals I already loved.\u201d\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, he hasn\u2019t made anything yet. But he keeps the knit bag of stuffing on his bed, waiting.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/12/03/the-good-stuffing/", "title": "The Good Stuffing"},
{"date": "December 2, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tI spend a lot of my time wondering how Nigel\u2019s autism affects my younger son, Aidan, who is twelve. He was about six years old when he first asked, \u201cWhy is my brother like that?\u201d as he witnessed Nigel screaming because of a transition. Since then, Aidan has said to me on numerous occasions, \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m the older one.\u201d And through the plaintive quality of his voice, I can hear what he doesn\u2019t say: Why does it have to be that way?\nI know that sometimes he feels embarrassed by his brother, even though he is reluctant to talk with me about it. I know that he is frustrated by him, how he \u201cnever listens.\u201d I try to talk to him, try to cultivate some compassion for his brother by being compassionate towards Aidan. I know it\u2019s hard for him. And I\u2019ve always hoped that with all the difficult aspects of having an autistic brother, he\u2019ll someday be able to see some value in him.\nApparently, that day has arrived. Aidan, my sensitive SPD kid, has a theory. He gets pretty philosophical on me sometimes, and we\u2019ve had some great discussions about existentialism. He thinks that, in spite of the technological advances we\u2019ve made with computers and such, humanity on the whole is not as intelligent as we were generations ago. His reasoning? Not the typical, too-much-TV, too-little-reading response. He believes that humanity is not evolving because autists have less of a chance of procreating. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked him, intrigued.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cPeople like Nigel are really smart. But because they\u2019re different, there\u2019s less of a chance that they\u2019ll get in a relationship and have kids. And some of the other really smart autistic people who can\u2019t talk, there\u2019s even less of a chance for them because they wouldn\u2019t be able to take care of kids if they did have them. But they\u2019re still really smart, inside. And so humanity\u2019s gene pool is less smart because not so many autistic people are able to contribute to it.\u201d\nI told him, \u201cIf more people were as smart as you are in realizing that, I\u2019m sure it would make a difference.\u201d\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/12/02/to-hell-in-a-handbasket/", "title": "To Hell in a Handbasket"},

I mean, I don\u2019t need an online test to tell me that I\u2019m feeling a lot of stress, but I just wanted to see how I would score. It was high. It actually said, \u201cYou have high stress. Take action now to reduce and manage your stress. Stabilize the amount of changes in your life and avoid unnecessary stress. Evaluate how you communicate, manage your commitments, and prioritize your time. Make stress-reducing lifestyle choices a priority: seek therapy or exercise.\u201d\nI scored high even without the following questions:\n\nDo you have a special needs child?\nIs your children\u2019s other parent involved less than 50% of the time? Less than 30%? Less than 20%?\n\nAnd that\u2019s probably good that the test didn\u2019t ask those questions, otherwise my results might have said, \u201cYou have immeasurably high stress. We\u2019re amazed you haven\u2019t had a stroke yet. Check yourself in\u00a0at your local mental health facility before you completely lose it. Don\u2019t bother seeking therapy or exercising. Those things can\u2019t help you now.\u201d\nI feel like I\u2019m teetering on a cliff and, at the same time, being pulled in several different directions. Homeschool, work, work projects, household stuff, autism stuff, SPD stuff, appointments, errands, meetings, trying to write. There are not enough hours in the day.\nI try to schedule downtime. This past weekend, I visited a friend at her house one night, and the other night I watched a movie at home with my boys. And those things are important, so I do them. But they don\u2019t eliminate any of the other dozens of things I have to do. Giving myself downtime doesn\u2019t seem to solve the issue of not having enough time to do all that I have to do.\nSo I go back to what the little online test advised: Evaluate how you communicate, manage your commitments, and prioritize your time. I think this is the crux of the matter. Autistic kids aren\u2019t the only ones who benefit from schedules \u2013 their parents do, too. I\u2019ll make myself a schedule so I\u2019ll be better organized.

{"date": "December 4, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tI have put off writing this post, but it is time. Holly at Fearless Females, one of the blogs I read on a daily basis, wrote about this subject, and it encouraged me to write a post about when (and how) I told Nigel about his autism. On that day, Nigel had experienced something that I\u2019ve referred to as a \u201clucid moment\u201d or a \u201cmoment of clarity\u201d (which Holly also recently wrote about). It was a rare moment when he might ask me a question, or I\u2019d ask him a question and he\u2019d answer me, not in the rote tone of autism, but in his own sweet voice, with complete comprehension and perfect enunciation. The words he used were his own, not echolalic, not a phrase he had memorized from a video that would fit within the context of the situation. And during these fleeting moments of clarity, I could see in his eyes that it was really him, not the autism, the usual vacant quality, that was communicating. At least, that\u2019s what it felt like to me.\nOn the day in question, I had received a call at work (up until I began homeschooling him a year ago, not a day went by that I didn\u2019t fear receiving the dreaded calls that my son\u2019s behavior was too disruptive, and I needed to leave work to come and pick him up). I\u2019m not sure what he did that day. It was a blur of many days, many issues. Once a boy who had somehow antagonized him came up to him, and Nigel grabbed him by the shoulders and swung him around and threw him on the ground. Another time he threw a pinecone in a friendly girl\u2019s face, because someone else had riled him up. He had chased kids with sticks in his hand. He had knocked desks over and screamed in class. He had refused to do class work, complaining, \u201cI\u2019m too hard,\u201d back when he was still learning pronouns.\nSo I picked him up from school, and his full-time education assistant explained to me what had happened that day. Nigel, age eight, stood with us for a moment, then walked off a little ways until we had finished talking. He hates being talked about, always has, and he\u2019s never been oblivious to it. And he knew that other kids\u2019 parents didn\u2019t talk to any teachers about what kind of day they had, every day. But that day, he was able to verbalize it.\nI will never, ever forget the feeling in my body as we walked to the car, side by side, and he looked up at me and said, so lucidly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me, Mom?\u201d Those words gripped me, set off a knot in my stomach, chilled me, stunned me (since most of his speech at that point was still echolalic or with incorrect syntax). I knew the day would come, because Nigel had always been social, and he was developing verbal skills. I knew one day he would wonder, and he would ask. I was not prepared for it that day, in the middle of second grade. So soon, so harsh. I stopped for a second and put my arm around him. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it when we get home, honey,\u201d was what I said.\nI berated myself later, wondering, Why, when he asked me what was wrong with him, didn\u2019t I say, \u2018There\u2019s nothing wrong with you, honey\u2019\u00a0?\u00a0 To this day, I wish I had said that instead. But\u00a0his words\u00a0had caught me off guard, and I wasn\u2019t prepared.\nHow do you explain autism to your eight-year-old autistic son? I don\u2019t even remember how I began. I\u2019m sure I tried to keep it as simple as possible. I think I started off by saying, \u201cSome people have a disability in their eyes and they can\u2019t see. And some people have a disability in their legs and can\u2019t walk. A disability is something that makes it hard for people to do things. There is a brain disability called autism. Autism makes it hard to learn to talk, and it makes your ears sensitive so they hurt when you hear air dryers in public bathrooms or leaf blowers outside or the vacuum cleaner.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure if he comprehended what I said, or if he was even listening. He didn\u2019t appear to be. I continued by telling him that his teachers and family will help him with understanding autism, and there are some good things about his autism too, like learning to read early and knowing how to read maps. I told him it\u2019s okay to have autism. He seemed fidgety at this point, and so I told him he could go watch a video. I hugged him, and after he left, I cried.\nBut not for long. I\u2019ve always acknowledged my emotions concerning having an autistic child, but I\u2019ve also come to realize that vigilance and advocacy are two things that I need to focus on, and they take up a lot of time and energy. So I let myself cry when I need to, but my mind soon jumps to begin composing an email to the Special Education Consultant (advocacy) about whatever issue caused me to cry, and then a split second later I\u2019m dashing out of the room (vigilance) to find out why Nigel\u2019s yelling or what just crashed.\nSo that day that I told my young son, with a huge lump in my throat, about autism, I did cry for a minute. Then I got up, went to my computer, and wrote \u201cNigel\u2019s Autism Book.\u201d I wrote it in the first person, starting with, \u201cMy name is Nigel. I like to run, read, laugh and play like other kids. But there is something different about me. I have autism.\u201d The rest of the book talked about how autism affects him. Things like, \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t know what to say and I say something from a video. I like to watch videos. But other people do not know words from my videos. First I will tell them what video I am talking about when I say something from a video.\u201d I ended with \u201cOther people have autism too \u2013 other kids and adults. Someday I can meet them.\u201d\nUnfortunately I didn\u2019t finish the book until after he had gone to bed, so we didn\u2019t have the opportunity to read it. The next day was traumatic for him. He was beside himself, physically and verbally acting out with anxiety and mentioning autism to all the teachers (I guess he was listening when I had talked to him). And, of course, I got a call at work that I had to come and pick him up. We came home and I read him the book I had written for him, and we read it with Aidan, who was six at the time. Nigel spent the rest of the day carrying his book around and later stated that he wanted to bring it to school the next day. He had such a relieved look on his face that I reprimanded myself for not preparing the book before telling him that he had autism. Of course! He needed something visual in order to gain some understanding of this bomb I had dropped in his lap. Now he had an explanation. Something he could show to other people because he couldn\u2019t explain it in his own words. He took it to school and showed his teachers and the kids in his class. And some of those kids still care, still look out for him, six years later.\nI consider \u201cNigel\u2019s Autism Book\u201d to be the most important thing I\u2019ve ever written. If I publish nothing as long as I live, I have helped my son with my writing, and that is worth so much. Nigel still keeps the book on his bookshelf, and every now and then I see him reading it, as if to remind himself how far he\u2019s come.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://fearlessfemales.blogspot.com/", "http://fearlessfemales.blogspot.com/2008/12/special-needs-or-a-word-discussion.html", "http://fearlessfemales.blogspot.com/2008/11/beauty-of-communication-even-without.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/12/04/when-i-told-him/", "title": "When I Told Him"},

I start thinking Wow, he\u2019s been doing really well lately, functioning, talking, responding well to the medication, being more independent. This is great! And then Blam! The phone rings, or I go to pick him up from somewhere, and someone starts to tell me that it\u2019s really not great, that there have been problems. And then I get that brick in my gut and go into apology mode and why me? mode and I just wonder how much more I can take of this.\nI went to pick Nigel up yesterday afternoon after the Scout camping trip he had been on. It was Friday night, Saturday all day, Saturday night, and they came home Sunday morning. He\u2019s done so much with his troop that I figured he\u2019d be fine for two nights and one full day. It had been hot there, and he didn\u2019t just withdraw, he got mean. He complained endlessly, he told his patient Scoutmaster that he wouldn\u2019t help clean or do any of his duties unless he would be taken home. He made everyone miserable and acted inappropriately.\nI think the problem is that he just doesn\u2019t realize\u00a0when his behavior is inappropriate. He can\u2019t regulate himself very well. The autism makes him think of himself and so he doesn\u2019t sensor his reaction to things. He doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks of his whining and complaining,\u00a0or care\u00a0that a 13-year-old shouldn\u2019t act that way.\nAnd so I try to tell him. Again. And again. But I think what will do me the most good is to realize that this is how it is. Just because he\u2019s doing well for\u00a0a few weeks unfortunately does not mean that we\u2019re in the clear. I need to accept that there will always be setbacks. I try not to think\u00a0of my apprehension about his behavior as he gets older.

It is proving to be difficult, needless to say. In his mind, an essay is a pasted-together document of sections of text written about a subject (usually found on Wikipedia). He cuts and pastes a paragraph at a time, until he has cut and pasted six paragraphs, clicks save, and triumphantly\u00a0announces that\u00a0he is finished with his essay.\nAfter I explained to him the concept of plagiarism, and he got mad because his easy essay-writing method had been thwarted, I decided that we should back up a bit and focus first on paragraph writing. I had him watch an educational video about horses and had him write a one-paragraph summary. I had told him that the paragraph needed to have 5-7 sentences, but he claimed that if he combined two sentences that they should still count as two sentences. So his paragraph consisted of two compound sentences and one concluding sentence. Below is\u00a0his paragraph, written in his own words, titled \u201cThe Horse.\u201d\nThe first horse came to be 5.5 million years ago, but had 3 toes on each hind leg and 4 toes on each front leg. As time passed, the forests turned into grasslands and the horse lost all but one toe on each leg and those turned into hooves. The reason why a horse wins the Kentucky Derby is because it\u00a0is just following it\u2019s gut instinct.\nAside from that apostrophe,\u00a0the paragraph\u00a0is\u00a0grammatically correct. But what impresses me the most is the complex idea that he takes as a given: a horse\u2019s \u201cgut instinct.\u201d What is a horse\u2019s gut instinct?\u00a0Running? Feeling its hooves\u00a0hit the ground? Trying to find its toes? I like the fact that his writing makes me contemplate different ideas.

And he loves it.\nThat probably has something to do with the fact that the CD-Rom is by Disney \u2013 Adventures in Typing with Timon and Pumbaa. The Lion King was the first Disney movie he saw that motivated him to try to quote single words, his first attempts at echolalia. And I had seen it\u00a0on the big screen\u00a0when I was pregnant with him, so it\u2019s always been a special movie for me as well. But now I love it because it has motivated Nigel to learn to type, and he\u2019s enjoying it. He typed the horse video summary by himself, as well as several others. He says he\u2019s going to type up a list of all his invention ideas.\nSo, typing, paragraphs . . . maybe next a mini-essay? A blog post? Not quite yet, but someday, quite possibly soon.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Disneys-Adventures-Typing-Timon-Pumbaa/dp/B000023VVH"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/05/21/before-paragraphs-typing/", "title": "Before Paragraphs: Typing"},

{"date": "June 19, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tThis time of year, when my sons are visiting their father for several weeks and I am alone, I spend a lot more time listening to music. I also try to spend some time meditating, and if I have music that helps me to get into a meditative state of mind, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be playing.\nSteven Halpern\u2019s Inner Peace Music offers many titles in that category, as well as other categories such as healing, relaxation, and learning. Steven Halpern has been in the New Age music industry for decades and has produced dozens of beneficial titles to aid in these areas and more. Our family listens to several of his albums.\nI am a long-time fan of Chakra Suite, a bestselling CD that never fails to put me in a meditative, relaxed mood. New Age Voice Magazine calls CHAKRA SUITE \u201c\u2026The most influential New Age / Healing Album of all time.\u201d The music on this CD is tonal in composition, without distracting chords and melodies, and is designed to balance the chakras. This creates an ideal atmosphere for meditation, relaxation, and healing. It helps immensely with the reduction of the stress that accompanies being an autism parent.\nI also love Music for Sound Healing, a CD that I play for relaxing background music. The album features grand piano, electric piano, flute, and harp, and includes Halpern\u2019s arrangement of Pachelbel\u2019s Canon in D Major. All thirteen of the soothing compositions provide a beneficial, healing environment.\nNigel loves the relaxing sounds of Peace of Mind. He says that it works the best to help him sleep, and he listens to it on a regular basis. The richness of Halpern\u2019s solo grand piano is exquisitely graceful. Aidan receives the most benefit from Sleep Soundly, with subliminal messages to instruct the listener to clear his or her mind and drift into peaceful slumber. Our household has been sleeping much better since we started listening to this wonderful music!\nIn addition to the titles for healing, meditation, and relaxation, Steven Halpern offers a line of subliminal self-help CDs, rhythmic world beat selections, music for yoga, music for learning, and several spoken-word meditations. Steven Halpern\u2019s music rounds out a holistic approach to in-home therapy for stress relief, sleep problems, and other areas affecting many families today, especially those with autism. I highly recommend this beneficial music.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.innerpeacemusic.com/index.asp", "http://www.innerpeacemusic.com/albumdetail.asp?pid=2", "http://www.innerpeacemusic.com/albumdetail.asp?pid=22", "http://www.innerpeacemusic.com/albumdetail.asp?pid=66", "http://www.innerpeacemusic.com/albumdetail.asp?pid=47", "http://www.innerpeacemusic.com/index.asp", "http://www.innerpeacemusic.com/index.asp"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/06/19/music-for-healing-meditation/", "title": "Music for Healing & Meditation"},

{"date": "September 18, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tThis astounding book was written by Tito Rajarshi Mukhopadhyay, a non-verbal autistic boy whose mother taught him to write at the age of five. He wrote The Mind Tree between the ages of eight and eleven, and it is nothing short of amazing.\nThe first half of the book is a detailed autobiographical account from age two to eleven. Tito writes in the first person point of view, but uses the third person when referring to his younger self (for instance, \u201cIt was a worse show when he was three and a half years old.\u201d) He also describes the thoughts and feelings of his parents in many situations, exhibiting a surprisingly advanced theory of mind. One of the delights of this book is Tito\u2019s insight and his ability to explain some of his autistic behavior, such as analyzing why he spins. He says that his body felt \u201cscattered and it was difficult to collect it together. He saw himself as a hand or as a leg and would turn himself around to assemble his parts to a whole.\u201d And \u201cHe got the idea of spinning from the fan as he saw that its blades were otherwise separate joined together to a complete circle, when they turned in speed.\u201d Tito also describes the \u201cdistorted . . . meaningless babblings\u201d that he made, and suggests to \u201cguardians\u201d of other autistics that they discourage those sounds, claiming, \u201cBeing mute is better than distortion.\u201d Later, he tells about how his mother helped him to \u201cfind\u201d his voice by physically forcing it out of him via pushing on his back as he attempted to verbalize sounds. I found all of Tito\u2019s detailed descriptions of his childhood to be intensely fascinating.\nEqually wonderful are the remaining parts of the book, including a section of essays written about his interpretations of color and how they manifest themselves\u00a0in his autistic mind. Tito also writes beautifully crafted, evocative poetry, such as \u201cAll the world was a busy place, And I was an idle kind, Disqualified in the human race, A different form of mind.\u201d We readers are also treated to the lovely imagery of his short story called \u201cThe Mind Tree,\u201d which is a touching tale told from the point of view of a tree. \u00a0Tito is truly a gifted writer.\nThis book is quite a find. I stumbled upon it in a bookstore a few years ago, and I am drawn in each time I read it. Tito\u2019s message of hope is evident in every word he writes, but especially in the ending to his first biographical section, which he wrote at age eight: \u201cOne day I dream that we can grow in a matured society where nobody would be \u2018normal or abnormal\u2019 but just human beings, accepting any other human being \u2013 ready to grow together.\u201d His words certainly prove the maxim that not being able to talk does not mean the same as not having anything to say.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Tree-Miraculous-Breaks-Silence/dp/1559706996/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1221806165&sr=1-3", "http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Tree-Miraculous-Breaks-Silence/dp/1559706996/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1221806165&sr=1-3", "http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Tree-Miraculous-Breaks-Silence/dp/1559706996/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1221806165&sr=1-3"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/09/18/the-mind-tree-a-review/", "title": "The Mind Tree: A Review"},

We apologize to the cat who was accidentally stepped on. I also try to get Nigel thinking in big-picture terms of empathy, such as donating stuffed animals, toys, and school supplies to a Hurricane Katrina project three years ago and having discussions about the impact of natural disasters and acts of terrorism on people and families, not just buildings.\nAnd so when my sister had the wonderful idea of Nigel joining her for a Habitat for Humanity walk in her area yesterday, I wholeheartedly encouraged Nigel to do it.

{"date": "April 4, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nI tend to notice a lot of things in early spring. By the middle of spring, I am usually plagued by spring fever and am unable to focus on much of anything. But in early spring, I\u2019m alert, I\u2019m happy that winter has come to an end, and I\u2019m much more observant. I notice, of course, that the grass and weeds in my yard grew while my back was turned and that the tree in the front has lost all of its pre-leaf blossoms overnight. I notice that my cats are shedding like we\u2019re in the middle of a heat wave. And I notice that my sons seem much taller than when I dropped them off at the airport nine days ago.\nThis time, at least, driving to the terminal to pick them up, I don\u2019t cry. I take it in stride now, their new ability to take a direct flight on their own. I will never take it for granted, but it is the new norm, the status quo. Of course, it is still a novelty, and I wait with excitement on the receiving side of the revolving security doors, watching. I see Aidan first, notice the sun across his nose, his hair, the color of milk chocolate, casually falling across his eyes. He wears cargo pants and flip-flops and sports a new shirt. Nigel towers behind him, also in a new shirt, and jeans, carrying a tote bag. I smile and wave as I approach them. I embrace Aidan, inhaling the scent at the top of his head, realizing that I won\u2019t be able to do that much longer. Nigel stiffly accepts a hug. Usually I don\u2019t think about it; this is how he hugs. But sometimes I wonder if it will always be this way. No matter. It is what is, and I love him for it.\nI notice a wide ring of chapped, irritated skin surrounding Nigel\u2019s mouth, and then I notice that he has shaved. Shaved! The last time he had gone to L.A. to visit his father (at Christmas), I had mentioned to him that Nigel might need to start shaving soon, but we hadn\u2019t discussed it since, and now, it\u2019s done. My little boy! Shaving!\n\u201cWow! You shaved!\u201d I exclaim.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he replies in his deep, steady voice.\nWe step out of the way of the other passengers filing through the security doors and start making our way to the luggage carousel. \u201cIt looks like the shaving caused some irritation to your skin,\u201d I say, which he denies. He claims that it had been windy and dry on a day that they were outside all day long, and that had caused it. But Nigel has always had extremely sensitive skin, so I am not convinced. He seems to believe that I might tell him not to shave any more if he admits that it irritated his skin, and no way would he give up a rite of passage that he\u2019d long awaited.\n\u201cWell, I think your skin just needs a little time to heal before you shave again,\u201d I suggest. \u201cIt needs to get used to the sensation of shaving, and then it won\u2019t get irritated when you do it. We\u2019ll put some lotion on it, and it should be fine in a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he says.\nLater, at home, I bring him some facial lotion. The lower half of his face is red and dry, the skin tight. He has been opening his mouth in an exaggerated manner, trying to \u201cstretch the skin so that it won\u2019t crack.\u201d I\u00a0suggest that doing so might make it worse, but he is adamant, even though he complains that it hurts. I cut to the chase.\n\u201cSo how do you feel about shaving? Do you feel like you\u2019re growing up?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with it,\u201d he states. \u201cIt\u2019s just another step to adulthood.\u201d\nApparently the rite of passage wasn\u2019t as big of a deal as I had thought. He takes it in stride, my not-so-little boy. I think I\u2019d do well to follow his lead. But for the moment, I can\u2019t get over the fact that my firstborn is shaving! Even though I knew it was coming, it snuck up on me faster than the grass and the weeds, faster than any sign of spring. Yes, spring is here, and my boys are growing up.

{"date": "May 2, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tAbout a year and a half ago, a fairly new friend of the family came over for a visit on a day that Nigel had forgotten to take his medication. Behaviorally, he was difficult \u2013 highly agitated and unfocused. \u00a0At one point, when he was prevented from doing something that he wasn\u2019t supposed to do, he went into full meltdown mode, growling and writhing on the floor, grabbing my legs and biting them.\nOur friend tried to put a humorous spin on things. \u201cOh, he\u2019s freestylin\u2019!\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, yanking a leg out of my son\u2019s grip. At the time, it was painfully obvious that Nigel very much needed his two types of medication to manage his behavior, both at home and at school. And it made a huge difference for him, enabling him to be mainstreamed with assistance and \u2013 unless a dose was forgotten \u2013 eliminating or subduing his meltdowns. I think both of us were relieved by it.\nBut Risperidone, like most medications, has its drawbacks. In addition to Nigel\u2019s excessively itchy scalp, it also caused noticeable joint stiffness for which he needed to see an orthopedist. And then there was something noticeable only to me \u2013 his eyes. I didn\u2019t get to see much of them anyway, but I saw them enough to know them. Now when I looked in his eyes, there was a listlessness \u2013 a vacancy \u2013 caused by the Risperidone. I wanted his behavior to change, not his countenance. Of course I welcomed the behavioral management, but his eyes were different. He didn\u2019t look like himself, even when he smiled. I looked forward to the day when I could look into his eyes and see him again.\nThat day came last week.\nThis past November, we discontinued the Zoloft, and he did fine with that. Every week afterward, Nigel kept asking me when he could stop taking Risperidone, and as much as I also wanted him to stop taking it, I wanted to be sure that he was ready. If not, we could have him go back on it, but that would have been difficult after the six-week weaning process (cessation of Risperidone can cause withdrawal symptoms if not done gradually). In March, I felt that he was ready, and we began the process. There were a few times when I wondered if it was too soon, but we pulled through. In fact, Nigel\u2019s overall adjustment has been phenomenal. During that six-week period, we had two weeks of considerable upheaval while all of the flooring in our home was being replaced. Every room of the house, including Nigel\u2019s, had to be completely emptied and furniture had to be relocated, including pieces of our sectional couch being kept in the kitchen for three days. Nigel was a bit on-edge during that time, and his medication was down to half-dose, but I am thrilled to report that he did not have a single meltdown. Not even close.\nHe became a little agitated at school during the weaning process, but he worked through it. This is huge progress for him! In the past, his agitation would lead to outbursts because he could not regulate his emotions or behavior. And now he can. The real test came last week when he was completely unmedicated and we attended his Court of Honor to receive a Scout rank advancement that he\u2019d worked toward for two years. He had a new merit badge sash that he spent quite a bit of time applying his merit badges to, and he looked forward to wearing it. That night, we ate dinner and then got ready to go to the Court of Honor. After he dressed in his uniform, Nigel built some Lego while I washed the dishes. When it was time to go, I grabbed my camera and my dessert contribution, and then we left. The meeting room, before the presentation started, was unstructured and loud with parents chatting and kids playing, and I looked to see how Nigel was handling it. I could tell he was getting a little amped up, and then I noticed that he had forgotten to wear his new merit badge sash. I had to tell him before he discovered it during the presentation, which could have been disastrous.\nI approached him quietly and broke the news. Angrily, he sucked in his breath and clenched his fists by his side. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I told him. \u201cLook \u2013 several of the other Scouts forgot their sashes too.\u201d I could see him processing, regulating. Within ten seconds he had unclenched his jaw and fists and merely sighed in disappointment. \u201cI was distracted by the Lego,\u201d he muttered.\nSighing and muttering. This is freestyle now, and it\u2019s a far cry from growling and writhing on the floor. In addition to that, he reported last week when he got home from school that for the first time ever he did not feel drowsy during second period, and he feels like he\u2019s able to focus better. His scalp no longer itches. To top it all off, the next night at dinner he looked at me as he described a new movie idea, and he held eye contact for the longest I\u2019ve ever experienced.

And so, we still dream.\nMy dreams for Nigel have certainly changed over the years, but I still have them. And so does he. Some of those dreams have come to include the possibility of a post-secondary education, which seems out of reach given his academic challenges and the lack of local resources to address those challenges. So, we found a resource \u2013 a special school \u2013 that can teach him the skills he needs to be able to work independently, and I foolishly believed that all I needed to do was fill out a bunch of paperwork and enroll him.\nI had no idea that the administration at his current school might not agree that this is something that he needs. I had no idea that they would be reluctant to change his IEP to reflect that his academic needs would be better met in a non-public school setting. I had no idea that the minor hoops I envisioned jumping through would turn into major hurdles.\nThe special school we would like Nigel to attend costs more per year than my entire college education did. Even when I sell my house I will not be able to pay the tuition out of pocket. However, we can receive funding if the change is made to his IEP, if it designates that his needs would be better met in a non-public school. I approached the special education coordinator at Nigel\u2019s current school, and she discussed it with the district sped coordinator. They declined\u00a0our request, stating that Nigel has made progress and \u201cis capable with supports to maintain grades.\u201d We have an IEP meeting scheduled next week to discuss this further. Nigel\u2019s father, who lives 700 miles away, will attend via conference call.\nYes, Nigel has grown. He has come so far. But the fact is that the progress he has made has been behavioral and social. And while this is indeed wonderful, his academic needs are not being addressed. The grades that he \u201cmaintains\u201d are heavily modified. The teachers do not even assign him homework! He can barely complete the class assignments, even with constant assistance. I know that they like him and care about him, but it appears that they are just pushing him through. If he cannot work independently, he will not be able to attend college. It\u2019s wonderful that he receives so much academic support; the special education coordinator helps him every day to do his work. But he needs to learn the necessary executive function skills to be able to do it on his own, and I don\u2019t expect him to learn that in a public school setting.\nI know that some of the professionals who have worked with my son have read this blog before and might be reading this post. I really hope that they do. Because I want to say this to them:\u00a0 Please. Please think of Nigel\u2019s academic needs. Please think of the dreams that he has. Please give him the opportunity to utilize the best academic resource that is available. He needs more specialized instruction than what you are able to provide. I do not fault you for this, especially since he is only the fourth ASD student to attend your school. I truly appreciate all that you have done for my son. Please just do this one last thing for him. Please.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/05/11/please/", "title": "Please"},
{"date": "May 19, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tLike most people, when I was in school (mostly college), I dreaded exams. I much preferred those classes in which the final exam was a paper or a project. Because as much as I could prepare for exams \u2013 researching, studying, memorizing \u2013 it gave me such anxiety knowing that I would have to retrieve all of that information in a limited amount of time and use it to prove that I knew what I was talking about. So much was riding on it, and I usually doubted how well I would do.\nYesterday, we had a very important IEP meeting for my son who has autism and is now in high school. He requires constant assistance to start, work on, and complete assignments at the public school where he is mainstreamed with extensive support. While we are very fortunate to have that support, I do not want his potential limited by a modified diploma. He needs to be taught to work independently, and I don\u2019t see how that could happen in his current placement. We found a school that specializes in teaching ASD students, and he has attended summer camp programs there. I asked his current school to change his IEP to reflect that his academic needs would be better met in the special program. \u00a0\u00a0\nI prepared for this meeting for two weeks. I researched online, I consulted other special-needs parents, and I printed out e-mails from my son\u2019s special education teacher that I had saved over the course of the school year, mentioning various times that she\u2019d had trouble getting him to do the work, and in which she was asking me for advice. I built a case showing that although I appreciate the support that my son receives, his academic needs were clearly not being met. I practiced my main arguments in my head for days. I threw all of my energy \u2013 mental, emotional, and physical \u2013 into my preparation. I meditated. I prayed. I tried not to lose sleep. I did everything I could.\nBut this was one exam that I could not pass. From the moment I sat down at that huge, intimidating table, the district special education coordinator controlled the meeting. She knew how it was going to go. She was diplomatic and acted sincere, but she did her job for the school district. No matter how convincing my arguments, no matter how irrefutable my evidence, no matter how much I stuck to the facts and did not let my emotions surface, she did not waver. It didn\u2019t matter what I\u2019d said or how many e-mails I produced. I felt railroaded. We never had a chance.\nI left the building and the tears immediately streamed down my face. I couldn\u2019t even make it out to my car first. I was not completely surprised at the outcome of the meeting, but still, I had hoped. And it was quite a blow. I know that I could hire a special education attorney and take the district to court. I know that we have a good case. But I also know that there\u2019s only so much I can take. I\u2019m supposedly so \u201cstrong;\u201d I\u2019ve been told that many times over the years. But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m vulnerable. And I\u2019m not going to fight that fight. \nBut I will continue to work for what\u2019s best for my son, even if it turns out to be something different than what I\u2019d thought would be best. When I tell Nigel, after I\u2019d come home, that the district would not approve transferring him to the special school that he wanted to attend, at first he\u2019s angry. \u201cWe need to call the authorities!\u201d he proclaims. But after a few minutes, after he feels my calmness and acceptance, and after we talk about our alternatives, he sighs and goes back to the cartoon he had been watching. I walk out to the kitchen to begin making dinner. \nI think about the huge changes that my son \u2013 that all of us \u2013 will be facing very soon as we move seven hundred miles away to be near the special school in Los Angeles. His father lives there, and my two sons have spent the past eight summers there. They\u2019ll go to the local public school, and we\u2019ll just keep working to get Nigel in the one we want him to attend. But I\u2019m open to the possibility that maybe something else will come up in L.A., some other opportunity that will turn out to be even better for him. Something we hadn\u2019t even thought of. After the meeting, walking out to the car, I felt so disappointed in myself because I knew that I wasn\u2019t going to fight the school district. I felt like I was surrendering, giving up. But now I see it differently. It\u2019s not surrender; it\u2019s hope. Hope for something better.\nA few minutes later, as if he picked up on my thoughts, Nigel walks through the doorway of the kitchen, stands there for a moment, and says, \u201cMaybe some good will come of it.\u201d It was most likely a line from a movie. But it couldn\u2019t have been better said. I put my arm around his waist and pat his back and tell him Yes, honey. I\u2019m sure of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/05/19/some-good/", "title": "Some Good"},

{"date": "April 8, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nAre you ready for the irony of Autism Awareness Month ironies?\nAs many of you know, I am the southern Oregon chapter rep for the Autism Society of Oregon, and I facilitate the monthly support group meetings. Since, as all of you know, this is Autism Awareness Month, I planned to show an informative DVD of a presentation given by an adult with Asperger\u2019s, loan out many of the books I\u2019ve reviewed here, share some Easter candy, and give out various autism-related \u201cgoodies\u201d \u2013 magnets, bumper stickers, symptom cards, etc. I got there a few minutes early, set up the TV/DVD player, put out all the books and paraphernalia, and thought about what I wanted to say during the meeting.\nBut no one came.\nNow I know that many of the support group members also read this blog, and I want to assure you that I am not writing this to complain or to indicate any sort of disapproval. It\u2019s totally okay! Some of you e-mailed to let me know that you would be out of town or otherwise engaged or might not have childcare. And while kids are always welcome to attend the meetings, I completely understand if you, the parent, would rather not have your child there, for whatever reason. Believe me, as a long-time single parent, I understand! I know how it is when you just want to get out of the house by yourself, but can\u2019t. And I definitely know Busy. Busy and I have been hanging out too much together lately, I\u2019m afraid. I know how it is when you just can\u2019t add one more thing. When you\u2019re so busy that it wouldn\u2019t be a break to attend the meeting, and a break is the thing you need most.\nAnd I know how it is to need a break from autism. Not necessarily from your child who has it (although that is often the case!), but from the barrage of all things autism \u2013 books, DVDs, news stories, events, meetings. I\u2019ll be the first to raise my hand and say that I\u2019ve often felt this way! Coming up on thirteen years post diagnosis, I sometimes feel over-aware. Saturated. Not to mention tired. All of us feel this way more often than not; it comes with the territory. And so, we need a break from autism. And it\u2019s understandable to feel a bit \u201cover\u201d the idea of Autism Awareness Month.\nTonight, I waited in the meeting room for twenty minutes, metaphorically shrugged my shoulders, packed up all of the autism stuff, and ate some Easter candy as I drove home. And I thought about the fact that the people who most need a break from autism don\u2019t get one. Every day our kids must contend with painful sensory issues, communication difficulties, social misunderstandings, vulnerability, and many other issues described so well by my friend, Jess, who wrote this post that I highly recommend you read. And I highly recommend that you pass it along to your friends and relatives. Because so often we talk about what autism is, but we don\u2019t always talk in specific terms about how it really is for our children. And once people can grasp that, wrap their minds around the reality of it, I think it will make a tremendous difference in how they view our kids and this thing called autism. That\u2019s what I think Autism Awareness Month is for. I\u2019m aware. You\u2019re aware. But there\u2019s a world of people out there who aren\u2019t.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://oregonautism.com/", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2010/04/02/world-autism-awareness-day-2010/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/04/08/aware/", "title": "Aware"},
{"date": "April 19, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tYou know how it is. When you have a child with special needs and you dare to venture out in public, you often get stared at, sometimes judged. You know what people are thinking because occasionally they say it out loud. \u201cSomebody needs a spanking!\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t you control your child?\u201d \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have him out in public, disturbing others.\u201d I\u2019ve heard it all. And believe me, it got to a point where I just stayed home, other than the mad dash to the grocery store, when I needed something and there was no one to watch my boys, so I took them with me. And why bother with restaurants? My older son\u2019s sensory issues were so extreme that he would writhe on the floor in agony, wailing \u201cgo\u201d every few minutes. It was one of the only words he could say at age five. \nTime passed, and we dared to venture out a little more. After years of intensive therapy, my son\u2019s sensory issues had become more manageable. But only for a limited time, of course. After ten or fifteen minutes in a restaurant, he needed to crawl under the table for relief. This does not look good at any age, but it\u2019s really frowned upon by age twelve. And although my son had eventually learned to talk, he still didn\u2019t understand the social expectation of thanking the wait staff when they bring you something in a restaurant. I would always model the appropriate response, and at some point, my son started saying \u201cthank you\u201d when prompted. Almost every day, in various situations, I would need to prompt him. After a while, after the thousandth time, I thought it would always be that way.\nThen one day not too long ago, at the age of fifteen, my son said his first unprompted thank you when someone had waited on him. I was happy, of course, but I figured it was an isolated incident. I figured that we\u2019d go right back to the prompting routine that had been in place for so many years, that it was a crutch for him. You see, even when my parenting is not being openly criticized by others, I criticize it myself. You know how it is.\nSoon after that day, we went to a restaurant. I sat in awe as my sons conversed. There was no wailing, no writhing on the floor. No crawling under the table. No going up to other tables and repeating a line from whatever movie had been watched earlier in the day. And when a plate of food was placed in front of my older son, he said Thank you. Completely unprompted. And I allowed myself to entertain the notion that maybe all the years of prompting had not been a crutch. It had been what he needed in order to learn what was socially acceptable, what was expected of him. It just took him a really long time to get it down.\nAnd now, he\u2019s got it down. Last week, we went out to dinner at a restaurant that we\u2019d gone to periodically over the years, once my son had gotten to a point where he no longer wailed and writhed on the floor. In the past, he\u2019d crawled under the table many times, he\u2019d gotten up and walked all around, he\u2019d had to go outside for sensory breaks. He\u2019d never acknowledged the waiters. But this time was different. This time it was like autism took the evening off. \u00a0\nI know that\u2019s not how it is for my son. Even on the infrequent occasions when things seem effortless, when things flow seamlessly, he is hard at work \u2013 processing, filtering, anticipating, regulating. Autism is always with him. But that evening, at dinner, he was flawless. He placed his order like a pro, he conversed, he joked with the waiter, he thanked him \u2013 unprompted \u2013 three separate times (!), he politely and discreetly asked where the restroom was and returned to the table afterward without wandering. It was nothing short of amazing, and perfect for the occasion \u2013 celebrating the publication of my book. For the first time ever in a restaurant, we were able to stay for dessert, and I savored every moment.\nBut the real treat, the best moment of all, was when the waiter brought us the check at the end. \u201cI just wanted to tell you how well-mannered your sons are,\u201d he said to me. Of course, all parents love to hear that. They smile and say thank you; they\u2019ve probably heard it before. But I never had. And my face probably looked strange to him as I said, \u201cThank you very much,\u201d while trying not to cry. All those years and years of stares and judgment, writhing and wailing and crawling under tables are finally behind us. Not to mention the years of incessant prompting, wondering why I bothered. Now I have my answer. \nAnd I don\u2019t think that waiter will ever know how much his words meant to me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Slip-Tanya-Savko/dp/0981786804/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1271734324&sr=8-1"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/04/19/taking-the-evening-off/", "title": "Taking the Evening Off"},
{"date": "May 26, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nI just finished reading an amazing book called Fearless Nest: Our Children As Our Greatest Teachers. So many of the beautiful stories in the collection resonated with me. And one thing the book really has going for it is that my friend Carrie is one of the contributors! In addition to that, it got me thinking about what I have learned from my children. What I\u2019ve learned from Aidan deserves a post of its own, but for today, I\u2019ll write about what I\u2019ve learned from Nigel.\nIt\u2019s the power of belief.\nBut\u00a0I\u2019m not just talking about the belief I have in his potential, or that he would learn to talk, that he could be mainstreamed in school, that he would learn to regulate his behavior. All of that involved a tremendous amount of belief, and, for that matter, it still does. Because I truly believe, in spite of all his challenges both past and present, that he will be able to navigate adulthood with some degree of independence. Most of all, I believe he will find people who will appreciate him, and he will have friends and be happy. Even if his connections aren\u2019t typical, I believe this with all my heart.\nAnd I believe that he will follow his dreams in adulthood, because he already does. Since his early years he has been a huge Disney fan. He loves the characters so much that he thinks of them as friends. In fact, his stuffed Tigger prompted him to speak one of his first words and start showing some imaginative play. These days, he owns almost all of the Disney movies, animated and live-action, the older ones as well as the newer ones with Pixar, and he rotates watching them. These movies have taught him how to talk, how to interact with people, and how to tell a story, among many other skills. But mostly, they comfort and entertain him. They are a big part of his life and he loves them.\nFor a few years now, he has talked about a movie idea he has that combines all of his favorite animated Disney characters. I\u2019m not clear on the plot details, but it involves him becoming an animated character and going into their world (a la Roger Rabbit, I suppose) to help save them from a new Disney villain, worse than all the Disney villains combined. A few weeks ago, he wrote a letter to the Disney Corporation outlining the plot and asking if they would be interested in his story idea for a future film. He typed it on his computer, printed it out, folded it up, put it in a #10 envelope, and addressed it by hand, which is no small feat with his dysgraphia. He sealed the envelope and came to ask me for a stamp. I mailed it the next day, not knowing what he had written, but hoping that it was coherent enough for them to at least send him a form letter thanking him for his interest. I told him that the Disney Corporation probably receives hundreds of pieces of mail daily and that it might take several weeks before he received a reply, if any. I tried to let him down easy, gently prepare him for disappointment.\nBut he believed.\nMy boy believed so strongly that he would receive a reply within two weeks. After the first week, he said to me, \u201cIt\u2019s been a week now. My response from Disney should be arriving soon. Let me know when it comes in the mail, okay?\u201d And I again reminded him that Disney may not be able to answer every letter they receive, etc. Still he believed. And I suppose I should not have been at all surprised when, on day eleven, a letter arrived from the Disney Corporation addressed to my son. He was shaking as he opened it, saying, \u201cI knew they would reply!\u201d And they did, within the timeframe that he believed they would. It was such a generous response \u2013 not a form letter at all. The kind soul who had opened my son\u2019s letter had taken the time to write a personal response. She told him that they would probably be interested in his idea (he loved that part!), but diplomatically \u2013 gently \u2013 explained that due to legal restrictions, they could not pursue it. And Nigel handled it very well. He said that he understood and was okay with it. He got his response, addressed to him on Disney letterhead, and that was enough for now. His belief came to fruition.\nAnd what do I believe? As we go forward with our out-of-state moving plans, I find myself faced with several huge unknowns, especially now that Nigel won\u2019t be attending the special school we\u2019d hoped for, at least not for a while. I don\u2019t know where the boys will go to school. I don\u2019t know when my house will sell. I don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll be living. I don\u2019t know what job I\u2019ll have. There is so much I don\u2019t know. But Nigel has taught me to believe. And I believe that everything will work out as it should. I believe that all of our needs will be met. I believe that all that I seek is seeking me. I believe that all will be well. And that is enough for now.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.lulu.com/product/item/fearless-nestour-children-as-our-greatest-teachers/11046264#reviewSection", "http://fully-caffeinated.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/05/26/believe/", "title": "Believe"},

We hadn\u2019t even heard of ABA. But we were steered in that direction by the therapists, teachers, and autism consultants who had identified him, and we went with it. We were surprised to learn of the intensive nature of the program \u2013 thirty hours a week with two weekly home visits. At that time we were living at poverty level, so the state paid the staggering costs of the therapy our nonverbal son so desperately needed, and we were grateful.\nBut had we been faced with footing the bill ourselves, we would have moved heaven and earth to do so. As it was, I went back to work shortly after the diagnosis. My then-husband worked evenings and weekends while I worked weekdays. Even with our nearly opposite work schedules, we still had some crossover time when we both needed to be at work. Nigel could not be put in daycare due to the severity of his autism at the time. We tried a few places and were turned down. There was also Aidan, who was eighteen months old then. My father had recently retired and offered to babysit a few afternoons a week to fill in the gaps, and I am forever grateful for that. My boss allowed me to leave work early when needed, and I am equally grateful to her. We made a lot of sacrifices and relied on the assistance and understanding of those close to us to get through those early years.\nAt some point, we noticed with dread that Aidan had strong sensory issues and a delay in language development and enrolled him in a therapy program similar to Nigel\u2019s, minus the ABA component. Having two special-needs children with all of their therapies, doctor appointments, teacher and specialist meetings, and juggling work and, ultimately, single parenting was painful, especially when their father moved 700 miles away. But I did what I had to. \u00a0And I would do it all again. There is nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for my boys.\nAnd I still do. When Nigel was terribly bullied at his middle school two years ago and the administration would not, as I requested, talk to the student body about developmental disabilities, I pulled him out and made sacrifices to be able to homeschool him. When Aidan developed an unknown health issue last year, we racked up innumerable hours scheduling and attending all of the various medical tests he endured and then the surgery, once his condition was identified. But that\u2019s what you do. You do whatever your kids need. And it has become painfully obvious that my boys, now teens, need two things: more time with their father and specialized instruction for Nigel.\nNothing I wouldn\u2019t do.\nSo I take a deep breath as I write this, as I commit the concept to print: We are moving to Los Angeles. Not next week or next month, but soon. In mid-June, for the past eight years, the boys have gone to visit their father for several weeks. This June, they\u2019ll move. I\u2019m putting my house on the market in about three weeks, and I will join them in L.A. as soon as it sells.\nIt\u2019s a huge change for all of us, but one that I believe will yield many positive results. Nigel will attend a specialized school for autistic students that will target his lack of executive function. And with his recent announcement of wanting to go to film school for college, we\u2019ll be in the right area for that to happen down the road. Aidan, who has had the hardest time living far from his father, will be near him year-round. And I plan to finally find a job that fits a little better with my English degree, as well as spend time with other family members whom I have missed for many years (I was born in L.A. and moved to Oregon for college).\nBut I can\u2019t begin to describe how much I\u2019ll miss beautiful Oregon and our family members and friends who live here. I have no doubts that this move is the right thing to do, and that this is the right time, but I have spent half of my life in Oregon, and there is much to be missed. It\u2019s not called \u201cGod\u2019s Country\u201d for nothing! Then again, the other half of my life has been spent in the \u201cCity of Angels,\u201d and, truth be told, my feelings aren\u2019t too mixed about returning to it. But for now, I\u2019ve got a yard to spruce up and lots of paperwork to fill out.\nIt\u2019s time.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1357154/oregon_turns_150_why_its_worth_celebrating.html?cat=16"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/04/13/nothing-i-wouldnt-do/", "title": "Nothing I Wouldn\u2019t Do"},

I could not yet read independently, but I so loved the books that were read to me that I wanted to write my own. I wanted to contribute to the universe of stories that enveloped me, entertained me, influenced me, and later, sustained me. I wanted to create worlds with words. And although I could not verbalize this at age four, I wanted to tap in. I wanted to be a part of the magic.\nAnd so, at age five, I wrote my first book, illustrated it, and \u201cpublished\u201d it. I took a piece of cardboard from one of my father\u2019s shirt packages and designed and bound my book with a cover. I even gave it a spine (although I didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what it was called). My accomplishment spurred me on, and I wrote more stories, \u201cpublished\u201d more books. I started a series about a mouse with a puffy hat and her animal friends. In sixth grade I wrote a novella about a mystery in my classroom. One of my friends illustrated it, my mother typed it, and my\u00a0father took it to his work and had several copies printed and spiral bound. I just loved creating books. I continued to write more stories throughout high school and college, and then I had children and set my fiction writing aside. And although my boys are wonderful beings who completely enhanced my life, there was a hole where my writing had been.\nSo, five years ago I decided to follow the old adage \u201cwrite what you know\u201d and wrote a novel about a single parent raising two children, one with autism. It went through many drafts, was edited by a complete stranger who knew nothing about autism, or me, or being a single parent, and went through several more drafts. At no point had I attempted to solicit an agent. It\u2019s not that I have anything against agents or the publishing industry! Definitely not. It\u2019s just that that avenue was not this book\u2019s destiny. This book was to be the culmination of what I dearly loved to do in childhood \u2013 write and publish my own books.\nI still love to create worlds with words. And now, I\u2019m thrilled to announce that my first novel, Slip, has been published! It\u2019s available to order on Amazon, although they seem to be having trouble keeping it in stock (!) It\u2019s also available directly from my publishing company: http://kovapublishing.com/books/\nThere\u2019s a quote by James Allen that I read on the back of a Celestial Seasonings tea box years ago: You will always gravitate towards that which you secretly most love.

There are four Scout meetings scheduled per month, but he can only handle two, so that\u2019s what we do. He has been around most of these boys for a few years now, and they do the best they can to accept Nigel\u2019s idiosyncrasies, or at least tolerate them. Most of the time, he gets through a meeting with minimal disturbances, and so I develop a sort of complacency.\nNigel had a bit of a hard time at the meeting last week, and I couldn\u2019t figure out why. I sat on the sidelines, with a few other parents who attended, and kept an eye on him, hoping he wouldn\u2019t get out of hand. He kept talking out of turn, interrupting leaders who were speaking, getting in kids\u2019 faces to spout movie echolalia, making noises, and generally not participating. Generally not functioning very well. I was convinced that he had forgotten to take his medication that morning. That has to be it, I thought. Usually, if we forget his medication in the morning, by evening he is disruptive and exhibits the behaviors I described. I kept looking at the clock, hoping he would not\u00a0become unmanageable, and finally the meeting ended and we went home without any major catastrophes.\nWhen we got home I immediately checked his pill container for the day. It was empty. He had taken the medication in the morning, so it wasn\u2019t that. What then? What had caused him to become so disruptive in a familiar environment with familiar people? And then the alarm went off in my head. My wake-up call.\nThis is what autism does. This is what it has always done, since he was a toddler. There are some things you can predict, some behaviors you can prevent, but some you can\u2019t. And there will be some things, plenty of things, you can\u2019t understand. I know this. I\u2019ve lived this. This is autism, and it\u2019s the reason why he acts the way he does. And medication helps, dietary changes help, and therapy helps.\u00a0 Advocacy helps. Awareness helps. But it\u2019s still there. It\u2019s still autism. \nSo I dig my heels in a little deeper. Eleven years post diagnosis, I choke up on the bat, I go deep, I open my eyes a little wider.

First-time novelist Elizabeth Burns displays her talent as an award-winning poet, creating simply stunning metaphors and lyrical prose with intricately woven images. Writing in the present tense, Burns imparts a sense of urgency that is central to the movement of the story. And what a story it is.\nWe readers are initially jostled between a background of Bridget, the main character, and her new home in Minnesota (where she moved from New York), a description of her parents, scenes from her first marriage, and finding out that her beloved cousin has breast cancer. We then briefly learn of Bridget\u2019s father\u2019s death and meet her two daughters, one of whom is autistic. The stage is set.\nBurns then deftly takes us back to when Bridget met her second husband, a successful sculptor, who is the father of her children. We glimpse evocative earlier scenes of Bridget\u2019s cousin and her father. Burns\u2019 bouncing back-and-forth between past and present may be off-putting to some readers, but her technique only serves to build towards the upcoming chaos that will surround Bridget\u2019s life. \u00a0Burns describes the whirlpool of anxiety as Bridget comes to terms with her daughter\u2019s diagnosis at the time that her younger daughter is born. Her cousin dies. Bridget\u2019s husband\u2019s bipolar disorder becomes unmanageable and he must be hospitalized. Upon his release, she receives the news that her father has stage four cancer.\nBut the best part about Bridget\u2019s character is that she\u2019s not perfect. She may be strong, but she\u2019s human. Her cool wit is juxtaposed with her vulnerable soul, and even with all the humor she injects into her life, she breaks. We see her naked fears and her feel her pain. But through it all runs the current of her dreams, and her determination. She learns that reaching out for help \u2013 from her support group, her therapist, and even her emotionally distant mother \u2013 is the only way to cope. Her endurance, her outlook, and her spirit are uplifting and inspiring.

If I ask him a question and he doesn\u2019t feel like talking, he silently mouths the words of his answer. This only works, of course, if I\u2019m near him and looking closely at his face, and even then, sometimes I can\u2019t figure it out, not being a lip-reader. I suggest that he might like to write the answer down. \u201cNo,\u201d he mouths, not using any vocal chords, not even whispering. He shuns writing with a writing utensil, preferring to type if possible, if the computer is on and accessible. He\u2019ll offer a thumbs-up or thumbs-down if my question requires a yes or no answer. He\u2019ll point if the question involves indicating a direction or the location of a missing item. Then, after exhausting all options for answering the question non-verbally, he\u2019ll sneer the answer in a low voice between clenched teeth.\nIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s losing his hard-earned, long-awaited speech. It\u2019s that he\u2019s being selective about when he uses it. It\u2019s as if his voice is a precious commodity and he doesn\u2019t want to expend it uselessly, unnecessarily. There is effort involved in speaking, both in choosing words carefully and in vocalizing and making oneself heard. But many times, when he is in his social mode, like at a party, he does not use this discretion, he is not concerned with conserving his voice, and he blurts out unfiltered comments. Of course, inconsistency is one of the more dependable traits of autism.\n\u201cSilence, exile, and cunning\u201d could also be considered traits of autism. I find myself faced with the choice of enabling Nigel by asking him questions that do not require a voiced answer or forcing him to answer verbally. Is it a need of his to be selective about when he chooses to talk? Don\u2019t I owe it to him to respect his choices, to meet his needs? Or is it more of a want and less of a need? At this point, I\u2019m looking at the big picture. Nigel turns fourteen in a few days. I think this may be his way of asserting his developing autonomy, and as such, it is a need. It\u2019s a need for any teen, but especially an autistic one. He knows when he can silently mouth words, and he knows when that won\u2019t work. He\u2019ll do it selectively.

{"date": "October 28, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tWhen my boys were little, one of my favorite things to do was inhale their scent at the backs of their necks and on the tops of their heads. And in doing this on a regular basis, I came to know their scents quite well. Consequently, I knew without a doubt when puberty had hit.\nThus we come to the next topic in the puberty series: Teaching self-care and hygiene. We increase the frequency of showers, introduce deodorant, teach about menstruation and body changes, etc., but we do it keeping in mind that repetition is essential to ASD kids absorbing any type of social learning like this. My fourteen-year-old son needs constant reminders when it comes to hygiene! But the difference between him and a typically developing fourteen-year-old is that my son will need reminders for much longer than the other.\nAs mentioned in the previous post, continue to teach sex education at your child\u2019s level of comprehension. Once your child reaches puberty, it\u2019s important to teach appropriate levels of affection with different circles of people in your child\u2019s life. Convey the difference between hugging family and close friends and shaking hands with people in the community. It\u2019s also important to remind your child about ways to recognize inappropriate touching by others and what to do about it if it happens. Teaching this to your child can help them if they are targeted for sexual abuse, which is unfortunately high among those with developmental disabilities. Many are trusting and have been taught to be over-compliant, which also puts them at risk. It\u2019s also recommended to teach the basics of reproduction at this age, whether it be written into your son or daughter\u2019s IEP as an educational goal or something that we parents teach at home.\nGiven the choice, we\u2019d also rather not teach our kids about masturbation, but with ASD kids, it\u2019s really important to discuss issues of privacy. Again, this is an area that will probably require some repetition about when and where it is appropriate to masturbate. Safety issues can also be a concern; they might insert things that could be harmful. If too much masturbation seems to be a problem, the presenters at the seminar I attended suggested increasing other physical activity during the day and decreasing downtime. Part of the reason for frequent masturbation is a need for sensory input, and often ASD kids don\u2019t have the ability to realize that themselves. \u00a0\u00a0\nTune in tomorrow for a discussion about emotional immaturity during puberty \u2013 understanding it and what to do about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/10/28/adventures-in-puberty-part-2/", "title": "Adventures in Puberty, Part 2"},
{"date": "October 26, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tThe Autism Society of Oregon recently hosted a seminar on puberty and sexuality, and even though I had to drive 352 miles round-trip to attend, I made it a point to do so. I could not pass up an opportunity to obtain valuable information regarding this challenging stage of development.\nThe seminar covered strategies in dealing with puberty, teaching our ASD children about sex education, how sexuality develops over the span of childhood and teenage years, and why this information is important for kids with developmental disabilities to learn. Because such a wealth of material was presented, I intend to break up what I learned into several posts over the coming week or so.\n\u201cNothing is delayed about puberty!\u201d This was probably the most important point of the seminar. \u00a0The second most important point was the distinction between puberty and adolescence. Puberty refers to the physical changes happening with the body, whereas adolescence pertains to the emotional and social changes in development. The two do not usually occur simultaneously with ASD kids. This important fact hit home with me. I thought about my son and how I had just assumed that because he was indicating an interest in girls that he had hit adolescence, and that is not necessarily so. I learned that he is probably indicating an interest in girls because he is reacting to his typically developing peers, whom he wishes to emulate. It doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s emotionally ready for it, even though his body is keeping up with the typically developing peers. In fact, I also learned that in some cases, puberty in ASD kids can occur earlier than in non-ASD kids. But adolescence usually occurs later. As one of the presenters aptly put it, \u201cAdolescence is fractured from puberty.\u201d\nSome parents don\u2019t want to think of their ASD children as sexual beings due to believing that they will be childlike forever. This is a common stereotype about people with developmental disabilities. Other stereotypes include assumptions\u00a0that they are \u201casexual,\u201d that they are unable to understand sexual desires, or that they have uncontrollable sex drives. Belief in these stereotypes\u00a0discourages\u00a0a perceived need for sex education. But without it, ASD kids are at risk for sexual abuse, inappropriate behavior in public, and possible diseases or pregnancy. It is imperative that our ASD kids are taught sex education at a level that they can comprehend, which can be accomplished by writing an IEP goal around Health/Human Sexuality Education. Of course, it\u00a0can also be taught at home.\u00a0\nHow do we do that? The short answer: Start young. The seminar presenters recommended starting off at an early age by teaching self-acceptance and an awareness of all body parts, including gender-specific parts. This also should include a talk about privacy and which parts should not be touched by others, etc. It is just as important to provide this information for ASD children as it is for typically developing children. They need to have this awareness. Even non-verbal children can absorb some of the information, and it may help to protect them. For their sake, we need to try.\nUp next: \u00a0What to teach during puberty \u2013 self-care and hygiene, personal space, masturbation, and appropriate levels of affection with others.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://oregonautism.com/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/10/26/adventures-in-puberty-part-1/", "title": "Adventures in Puberty, Part 1"},
{"date": "October 29, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tAnd now, the part that you\u2019ve all been waiting for (I know, because I was, too) \u2013 dealing with emotional immaturity during puberty. This is the crux of the matter, I think. This is what makes us wonder what is going on with our ASD kids, why they fly off the handle, why they indicate an interest in dating even though they\u2019re nowhere near ready for it. I went to the Autism and Puberty seminar seeking advice about these points, and I understand a lot more now than I did before.\nSo far I\u2019ve been able to determine two main issues contributing to problem behaviors during puberty:\n1) Learning to deal with hormones. It\u2019s hard enough for NT kids to handle their surging hormones, and for ASD kids, it\u2019s even more difficult. And ASD children who had severe sensory issues when they were younger are going to have a harder time. It took my son, who is now 14, years to learn how to filter out all the sounds and other sensory issues that were agonizing to him as a younger child. Similarly, it took him about a year to learn to filter or \u201cdeal with\u201d all the new hormones surging through his body once puberty hit. He seems to have reached a (probably temporary) plateau at the moment, but prior to a few months ago, he was frequently agitated, short-tempered, and volatile. \u00a0He seems to have adjusted to the hormones, although I\u2019m bracing myself for future \u201csurges\u201d as we get through the rest of puberty. Hormonal changes are also said to possibly trigger seizures in kids who had not previously had them, up to 1 in 4. (The presenter at the seminar explained that seizures in young ASD kids are caused by a different type of brain activity.)\n2) Emotional immaturity. What exactly does this mean? As we know, autism is categorized as a developmental disability, a pervasive one that affects many different areas of development. As ASD kids get older, many of them do develop language and communication abilities, cognitive development improves, and sensory integration can as well. But social and emotional development usually lags behind, even in the presence of high cognitive ability. How behind? It varies, and it depends on something called emotional age. Emotional age is the level on which your child relates to others, and it is usually determined at your child\u2019s school. For example, when Nigel was in fourth grade, his teacher explained to me that his emotional age was four. Yes, four, when he was ten years old. What do they base that on? Usually they do observational testing, but parents can figure it out themselves simply by looking at what age group of children your child seems to relate to the best. At the time, Nigel was relating to preschoolers, and he often acted like one. Over the past four years, he has progressed. He has friends that are his own age, but he does not fully relate to them and they do not relate to him. They like him, they spend time with him, but they have a hard time understanding him. However, there is an 8-to-9-year-old boy in the neighborhood Nigel plays with, and they seem to be on the same level emotionally. This makes me believe that Nigel\u2019s current emotional age is about eight.\nI think about what it would be like to be eight years old and going through bodily changes and dealing with hormones, starting to have sexual feelings and not having the maturity to handle them. My son sees his peers interested in girls, he sees his age group being portrayed a certain way in the media, and so he thinks he should be that way because he wants to fit in. Of course, all teens want to fit in. But a 14-year-old with an emotional age of 8 is going to have a much tougher time. And he isn\u2019t ready because he hasn\u2019t even hit adolescence yet.\nIn the next post: emotional age and adolescence, and what to teach older teens.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/10/29/adventures-in-puberty-part-3/", "title": "Adventures in Puberty, Part 3"},

It\u2019s what makes adolescence come later for ASD teens. And if their social-emotional gap is large, they don\u2019t reach adolescence until well into adulthood; in some cases, not at all. For ASD parents, puberty and adolescence is a long ride that can last into their child\u2019s twenties or later; it\u2019s not over after twelfth grade! Parents are constantly teaching, and ASD teens are constantly learning. It\u2019s a time for reaching out to peers and being more aware of the media. They get information from many sources, and it needs to be filtered. Even though at the onset of adolescence ASD teens tend to want more peer interaction, they are still not connected to what their behaviors look like to others. They will need constant communication about what\u2019s appropriate and inappropriate, and it\u2019s up to parents to provide it. ASD teens don\u2019t ask the questions that NTs ask. It\u2019s up to parents to anticipate what they need to know and guide them.\nTypically, adolescence \u2013 the time of emotional and social maturation \u2013 begins at around age 11 for girls and 12 for boys. In the previous post, I estimated my son\u2019s emotional age to be around 8 or 9. Therefore, I can guess that he should begin adolescence in 3-4 years. He will be 17 or 18. Before I attended this seminar, I thought that because he recently started indicating a budding interest in dating that he was entering adolescence. This is not the case. He is merely reacting to what he sees with his typically developing peers and the teens he sees in the media. About a month ago he asked me what \u201cflirting\u201d meant. I explained it to him in simple terms, and then he printed out a Wikipedia definition and proceeded to notify me whenever he witnessed what he thought was flirting, based on the Wikipedia description. Even 8- and 9-year-olds have crushes and can indicate an interest in the opposite sex. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re entering adolescence yet, and neither is my son.\nWhen he does get there, the presenters at the seminar recommended teaching the following:\n\nHow relationships grow\nHow sexual feelings happen and how they can be handled\nDifferences between love and sex\nLaws and consequences of inappropriate sexual touching of self and others; importance of impulse control\nHow pregnancy can be prevented \u2013 abstinence and birth control\nSexually transmitted diseases\nHomosexuality\nResponsibilities of marriage and parenting\n\nThat\u2019s quite a list! I know I\u2019ll need help with that, and I\u2019m sure other parents will, too. Stay tuned for a list of resources, which will be posted in the next installment.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flirting"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/10/30/adventures-in-puberty-part-4/", "title": "Adventures in Puberty, Part 4"},

I\u2019m doing NaNoWriMo!\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar, NaNoWriMo stands for National Novel Writing Month, and it happens every year in November. This is my first go at it, and I\u2019m both excited and exhausted. The object is to write a 50,000-word novel in 30 days. Just for a little perspective, the typical word count in a whole month of my blog posts is approximately 8,500.\nAs of yesterday, I passed the half-way point and am right on track with my word count! As I focus on the second half of the novel and the home stretch of completing it, I\u2019ll be scaling back on my usual posting schedule here at Teen Autism (just for the next two weeks).

I intend to interview friends and relatives to get the viewpoints of everyone who is affected by having someone with autism in their lives \u2013 past, present, and future.\nI wanted to start off with one of the more recent people to become involved with Nigel \u2013 my boyfriend, Rick. We have been dating for several months, and I recently talked with him about his views on dating someone who has an ASD child. Additionally, for some insight into what it\u2019s like to date and be married to someone on the spectrum, check out Jeffrey Deutsch\u2019s informative posts on relationships. Another interesting post was written by Sam, who dated someone with Asperger\u2019s. We can all learn so much from each other.\n1. Did you have any experience and/or preconceived ideas about autism prior to knowing that I have an autistic son? What did you think at first?\nI didn\u2019t have any thoughts \u2013 I had heard stuff on the radio about autism, but really had no idea what it was about.\n2. From what you know now about Nigel\u2019s autism being more severe when he was younger, do you think if you had met and dated me then that things would have been more difficult?\nProbably, but I wouldn\u2019t have left.\n3. What, in your experience now, is the most challenging thing about dating someone who has an autistic child?\nWhen he was younger, I\u2019m sure that getting a babysitter would have been a big challenge, but right now it\u2019s not really much of a challenge to me, and I don\u2019t mind it. I\u2019m accepting this for what it is.\n4. What are the things you enjoy about dating someone with an autistic child?\nHe makes me laugh sometimes \u2013 stuff he says. I do have fun with him and the way he laughs.\n5. Do you have concerns about the future regarding Nigel living with me into adulthood?\nNo, I\u2019m a very family-oriented person.\n6. Why do you feel comfortable dating someone with an autistic child?\nMy brother has paranoid schizophrenia, so I\u2019m used to different behaviors and ways of communicating.\n7. Would you feel differently if Nigel were still non-verbal?\u00a0 No.\n8. Any advice for someone entering a relationship with a person whose child has autism?\nBe patient, and let the kids get to know you at their own pace.\n9. What about for the parent whose (teenage) child has autism?\nDon\u2019t worry about him being out in public and disturbing people; let him spread his wings a little more.\nMany thanks to Rick!

I was especially interested to see if it would help with his difficulty in falling asleep, as it used to take him hours before he could calm his mind down enough to drift off to sleep, and he would be chronically groggy and irritable because of it.\nEnter Brain Sync\u2019s Sound Sleep. This CD has made a profound difference in Nigel\u2019s ability to fall asleep quickly. Its deep Delta brain wave frequencies and soothing music help him to slow his active mind and ultimately lull him into restorative sleep. As a result, he gets up quicker in the morning, is more alert, and generally functions far better than without listening to the CD. And he loves it. Every night, he gets it set up in his CD player (Brain Sync recommends the use of headphones for optimal benefit, but due to Nigel\u2019s sensitive hearing, he does better without them \u2013 otherwise the Delta frequencies are too much for him to process), and eagerly turns it on as soon as I say good night to him. \u00a0I feel so much better knowing that he\u2019s getting good sleep, and then, of course,\u00a0so do I.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.brainsync.com/product.asp?specific=156&affiliate=286530"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/11/11/brain-wave-therapy-update/", "title": "Brain Wave Therapy: Update"},
{"date": "November 20, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tThe title of this post is one of the more common search phrases people use to find this website. And since it\u2019s a topic that I deal with on a daily basis, I decided to\u00a0describe my approach.\nMotivation is either extrinsic (\u201ccoming from without\u201d) or intrinsic (\u201ccoming from within\u201d).\u00a0 Both involve what the person in question perceives as rewards, either tangible (extrinsic motivation) or intangible (intrinsic motivation). Depending on your child\u2019s emotional age, they will start off with extrinsic motivation and, as they mature, they will start responding to intrinsic motivation. It\u2019s just been in the past year or two that I\u2019ve been able to cultivate Nigel\u2019s intrinsic motivation, but he still relies heavily on extrinsic.\n*Extrinsic Motivation (Tangible Rewards): \nA. Time doing what they love:\n\nWatching movies/videos\nPlaying video games\nComputer time\nGoing to a favorite museum or other place of interest\nBike-riding, hiking, or other physical activity they enjoy\nGo-karting, bowling, or other activity\n\u00a0Going to the library\nInviting a friend for a sleepover\n\nB. Things they can earn:\n\nAllowance\nBuying a new book, toy, or model to put together\nRenting a video game or DVD\n\nC. Consequences (the other side of the reward coin):\nIf they don\u2019t do what they need to be motivated to do, **they lose time allotted for doing what they enjoy, and/or they lose the privilege of earning things that they want.\nIntrinsic Motivation (Intangible Rewards):\nA. Personal Achievement:\n\nFinding things that were lost (e.g. during room cleaning \u2013 this is also an extrinsic reward)\nContributing to the family/household\n\nB. Helping People:\n\nHabitat for Humanity Walk\nScouting for Food\n\nNigel is learning the\u00a0rewards of intrinsic motivation by being involved in the aforementioned causes. I also use one of his regular chores, cleaning out the cat litter, as an intrinsic motivator: he is helping someone who can\u2019t do something themselves and in doing so, gains their love and loyalty. He is also contributing to the family and household by helping out, and he is learning that a sense of community is its own reward.\n**Example of losing time allotted for doing what they enjoy:\nNigel has a hard time getting up in the morning. I offer him the extrinsic motivation of warmth, either through a warm blanket (fresh out of the dryer) to wrap himself in, or a warm breakfast or drink. If that is not motivating enough, for every 5 minutes that he continues to stay in bed, I deduct 10 minutes off of his computer time for the day. As far as intrinsic motivation, I could tell him that getting out of bed on time would yield the satisfaction of a productive day. But he\u2019s definitely not there yet on that one.\n*Remember: The only way that extrinsic motivation will work is to follow through with both rewards and consequences. Consistency is key!\nNote: When Nigel was younger and non-verbal,\u00a0I used a system of visual cues to help schedule and motivate him. Holly at Fearless Females has written a post outlining the visual system she uses with her non-verbal autistic daughter that helps to motivate her to do things.

{"date": "November 26, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tThanksgiving always poses a problem for those who are orally defensive. And although sensory processing disorder occurs simultaneously with many ASD individuals, it also occurs in those who do not have autism. My non-autistic younger son, Aidan, is highly orally defensive, and has been since infancy. It was so bad that sometimes while breastfeeding, if the milk tasted differently to him, he would scream and act as if I were trying to feed him motor oil. It was not fun for either of us.\nThe term \u201cpicky eater\u201d does not seem to be the most fitting for Aidan, now twelve years old. Nigel, my autistic son, I would describe as a \u201cvery picky eater.\u201d Aidan I would describe as a \u201climited eater.\u201d Whereas Nigel will choose from an array of five acceptable breakfast items, Aidan will eat one (cold cereal and milk, alternating between two types of cereal, and that has only been a very recent development). Nigel will eat any of 12 choices for lunch and dinner, and Aidan is limited to five, and there are limitations even within those five.\nHe does not eat sandwiches. No macaroni and cheese. In fact, no cheese at all. He\u2019ll eat pizza, but only after he peels off the cheese. No waffles, no oatmeal, no eggs, no CAKE even. For his birthday, he has cinnamon rolls.\nI used to fight him on this. I recall when he was four years old that I gave him a tiny piece of lettuce and he refused to eat it, of course. So I sat on the kitchen floor with him and held him and put the piece of lettuce in his mouth and forced him to eat it. And I swore I would never force him to eat anything again. \u00a0I tried making bargains with him, I tried letting him go hungry until he would eat what was on the table. I tried reward charts. I tried grounding. Nothing worked.\nIn fact, the only thing that has worked is respecting his oral defensiveness. Respecting the fact that he has a hard time eating in the first place, and he only weighs 78 pounds, and \u201cletting him go hungry\u201d is the worst possible thing I could do because then his stomach would shrink further, making it even more difficult for him to eat the next time he tries. There are compelling reasons why he won\u2019t or can\u2019t eat many foods, and the best thing I can do is accept it and work with it.\nAnd so, tomorrow, when we go to my mom\u2019s for Thanksgiving as we do every year, we will bring Aidan\u2019s certain brand of turkey hot dogs that he eats. And the raw baby carrots, the only vegetable he will eat. And he\u2019ll sit at the table with the rest of us, and everyone understands (after some years of fruitless cajoling) that he will only eat what he eats. And we\u2019re all a lot happier for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sensory-processing-disorder.com/index.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/11/26/when-eating-is-difficult/", "title": "When Eating is Difficult"},

{"date": "November 30, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tWhen Nigel was younger, most of his meltdowns occurred due to sensory overload, usually from noise. I couldn\u2019t take him into grocery stores, restaurants, pumpkin festivals. We stayed home a lot as a way to avoid potential meltdowns. Then there were the meltdowns that occurred as a result of his frustration with not being able to communicate, which happened anywhere, especially at home. So we used PECS and visual schedules to try to avoid those meltdowns. I never succeeded in eliminating them, of course, but it was a desperate game that I played, trying to anticipate a meltdown and evading it any way I could.\nNow that he is older, and can successfully use ear plugs, I rarely worry about meltdowns due to noise. We frequent grocery stores, restaurants, and a festival now and then. We don\u2019t need to stay home as much, and that is liberating. Nigel is also now verbal, has been for several years, so we no longer use PECS to communicate, and he doesn\u2019t have meltdowns due to communication problems (except when he was mainstreamed in public school). But there\u2019s another type of meltdown.\nSometimes, having the emotional\u00a0age of an eight-year-old, Nigel has a meltdown when he can\u2019t have something he wants. And there is usually a build-up, either by someone (often his younger brother) antagonizing him, or by me letting him have other things that he wants and then cutting him off. Last week he kept upping the ante, first asking for restaurant pizza, then ice cream for dessert, then buying a movie that he had to have. Feeling like a neglectful parent due to NaNoWriMo, I let him have those things. Then the next day, he went for a walk in the neighborhood, wearing his watch so that he would come home at the stated time. Ten minutes later, he came bursting through the front door, panting, saying that some people down the street were giving away free kittens. And he wanted to go back and get one.\nYes, yes, I know \u2013 you can never have too many cats. I love them, I do. We have two wonderful cats. But with two kids, two cats, two jobs, and a house on my plate, I do not need another pet right now. And I want Nigel to learn that getting a pet is not something about which to be impulsive. So I gently told him no and explained my reasoning. I felt a switch turn on.\nNigel went into meltdown mode. He was in my office and that would not do. I tried to guide him out but he would not budge. I shut off the lights and said, \u201cLet\u2019s discuss this while I make dinner,\u201d and he followed me to the kitchen. When he realized that I was not going to back down, he began shouting, \u201cCommunist! I\u2019m going to report you to PETA!\u201d and grabbed a knife out of the drawer. I took it from him before he even started to do anything with it, then he ran to his room and grabbed a screwdriver and held it to his jugular. This was quickly turning scary,\u00a0in spite of\u00a0the PETA remark.\nI grabbed the screwdriver out of his hand and walked through the living room. Aidan, who had spent the night at a friend\u2019s house the night before, was napping on the couch. And there was something playing on the TV. Something Nigel hadn\u2019t seen in a long time: Walking with Dinosaurs. Nigel stopped following me and fixed his attention on the TV. I rounded the corner and slowly peered back around it, realizing that Nigel had been distracted. I hid the screwdriver and snuck back to my office, knowing that if I made dinner and tried to serve him now, he would refuse to eat and would probably resume his tirade.\nI waited half an hour while Nigel watched Walking with Dinosaurs, feeling triumphant that I had escaped a worse meltdown. Saved by a DVD. Sometimes he has persevered in his self-injury, sometimes he has run out the front door and I\u2019ve had to wrestle with him to get him to come back in, sometimes he has threatened me, often he has broken things. Meltdowns get scarier as our kids get older and bigger. \u00a0We have all learned ways of attempting to avoid them, or to cut them off at the pass once they begin. When they do, here is what (sometimes) works in our house (when I\u2019m lucky):\n\nRemoval from the room in which the meltdown originated\nParent remaining calm but in control\nDistraction: Turn on music or the TV\nSufficient time for a calming period\n\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Walking-Dinosaurs/dp/B000GTJSFS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1228080548&sr=1-1"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/11/30/escaping-a-meltdown/", "title": "Escaping a Meltdown"},

It helps him to organize the vague concept of time, helps him to mentally prepare for upcoming events, and it even helps him to decide what to wear. He takes the concept of seasons very seriously and dresses according to the calendar, not the weather. Spring means short-sleeved shirts, even if it\u2019s still snowing. If we\u2019re having a really hot day in May and I suggest to him to wear shorts, he maintains, \u201cIt\u2019s not summer yet.\u201d Summer means shorts, no matter what the forecast. But no shorts before it\u2019s officially summer. And by God, no pants before fall.\nThis morning as we were beginning homeschool, it was a bit chilly in the house, so I put on jeans and a sweatshirt.

His reply was automatic. \u201cIt\u2019s not fall yet.\u201d I jumped up and ran to the calendar.\n\u201cBut it IS fall!\u201d I said, gesturing wildly to the calendar. \u201cToday is the first day of fall!

I admit I had a little fun with that. But I\u2019m glad that his effort to rebel against my suggestion has made him less rigid about adhering to his self-imposed seasonal dress code. This is definitely a step in the right direction, an openness to change. Never mind the emerging need for rebellion! We\u2019ll just ignore that issue for now.

But I have more gray hairs that were caused by\u00a0my son\u00a0getting lost than by everything else combined.\nNigel is a wanderer. Up until he was about seven I had to have a lock high up on the front door or he would just run out and take off down the street. I wondered how I would handle it when he got older and could reach the lock. Implant one of those tracking devices? He was a runner, and it worried me. But something happened when he started to talk. He seemed to have less of an inclination to want to escape, and saying, \u201cStay in the house\u201d was something he could understand. I felt like I could breathe a little bit more.\nBut the wandering nature is inherent. Whenever we are away from home, his exploratory urge kicks in, and he takes off if I\u2019m not constantly watching him. Sometimes, in recent years, he tells me where he is going, but the odds are that he will not still be there when I come to collect him. Something else will have caught his attention, and he will have moved on. And I will spend the next half an hour running around looking for him, wringing my hands, imagining someone taking him, considering notifying the police, and basically driving myself into near-hysteria. \u00a0And it just happened yesterday. Again.\nWe had gone to a large park in a nearby city where an international fair was being held with lots of booths, exhibits, musicians, dancers, and food and craft purveyors. Nigel informed me that he wanted to go to the playground. I said okay, later wishing I had added, \u201cand wait there for me.\u201d After about ten minutes, we made our way toward the playground, and as we neared it, I glanced around for Nigel. I saw him scaling a mini climbing wall and started walking in that direction, briefly looking at some traditional Mexican dancers off to the side.\u00a0 A moment later I reached the climbing wall, and there was no sign of Nigel. I went around the back of it. Not there. I looked at every playground feature. No Nigel.\u00a0 Not again! I wanted to yell. How does he continue to do this to me?! He was just here!\nI looked at the surrounding area, up in trees, around bushes (in case he had followed a bird or squirrel), all around. No sign of him. I informed the rest of our party (Aidan and my boyfriend) that Nigel had taken off, and they joined in the search. We walked through all the booths, went beyond the playground where there was an inflatable jumping/ball-pit thing attracting lots of kids, and even checked the belly dancing show going on. No Nigel. Then I retraced our steps back to the band we watched when we first arrived. Then I went back to the playground. I ran into my boyfriend and he suggested notifying the police. I said I wanted to make one more sweep first. I went beyond the playground, past the inflatable jumping/ball pit thing, past the belly dancing, and there, there, around the other side of all of that, was a fire engine. I saw Nigel\u2019s head in the side window of the fire engine. He was seated with a bunch of little kids less than half his age, smiling and excited to be sitting in a fire engine. Oh, my son.\nSo many times have I felt this emotion without a name. It is a combination of intense relief, but also frustration, a little anger, and exasperation. The relief, of course, overpowers everything else. But how many times must we go through this? How many times must Aidan help look for his older brother? How many times must our plans be disrupted? How many times must I fear that he\u2019s been taken? It is still so hard to bear, that sense of dread. The hysterical fear that he has been taken.\nAnd yet, somehow I bear it. I must and I do. I say to myself when I find him, He\u2019s okay, and that\u2019s all that matters. And I admonish him for not staying where he said he\u2019d be, and he apologizes, and we go on our not-as-merry way. And I think some more about implanting a tracking device in him. Or getting walkie-talkies. That is, if his could be strapped on to him somehow. Otherwise, I\u2019d have a lost son and a lost walkie-talkie. Not to mention more gray hair.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/09/21/lost-and-found/", "title": "Lost and Found"},

{"date": "September 25, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tLike many families with autism, we start planning for Halloween early. When Nigel was younger, it was to prepare him for the sensory issues that would come up. Eight years ago, the Halloween that he was six, while we carved pumpkins I played a cassette tape of \u201cspooky\u201d sounds: wind blowing, doors creaking, chains dragging, and an occasional howl or scream. Nigel was very disturbed by the tape, so I shut it off so that he could join us with the pumpkin carving. For the next hour, even though the music had remained off, Nigel would say every few minutes, \u201cMusic is off. Music is finished. No more music.\u201d We didn\u2019t hear much spontaneous speech from him in those days, but he was really motivated to tell me how he felt about that tape. Every time he said it, I assured him in a calm voice, \u201cThat\u2019s right, no more music,\u201d but he continued to make his statements until we were completely finished carving the pumpkins. (I realized that maybe because I left the tape player in the kitchen with us that he was afraid that the music would start again; I should have put it away, out of sight.) The following year, when Nigel was seven, I mentioned getting pumpkins to carve for Halloween, and the first thing out of his mouth was \u201cAnd we will not play the Halloween music.\u201d (His sentence structure improved greatly that year.) Then he said it a few more times that afternoon, and we hadn\u2019t even bought the pumpkins yet.\nBut in recent years, the reason we start planning for Halloween early is because we love it so much,\u00a0especially Nigel. We have many decorations to put up \u2013 both inside and outside, costumes to piece together, a party to plan (Nigel\u2019s birthday is October 27), and movies to watch. Our all-time favorite is Disney\u2019s The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, and we try to watch it only in October. Nigel couldn\u2019t wait any longer and had it on the other day. I walked past him as he watched it in the living room, and he commented, \u201cBrom Bones is a bully. He is an angry DNA strand.\u201d\n\u00a0I\u00a0told him that was a good way to put it.\nThen a few minutes later, after the scene in which Brom Bones sings his spooky song at the end of the party, Nigel said, \u201cI remember when those kinds of sounds scared me. They really gave me the heebie-jeebies \u2013 when I was a little kid. But I\u2019m not afraid anymore. You know that music you played while we used to carve pumpkins? I don\u2019t mind it now.

{"date": "October 5, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tLife as a single parent is challenging enough. Throw autism into the picture and every limitation is magnified. Try to date and you may decide to just NOT for a while. When your kids are younger, you have to deal with finding someone to watch them so you can GO on a date, and then when your date arrives to pick you up, your echolalic five-year-old son greets him at the door with a shout of \u201cBalto!\u201d because he had just watched that movie. Then when you can\u2019t find someone to watch the kids and your date gallantly albeit naively suggests taking them to the Chinese restaurant with you, you try to sound spontaneous by saying \u201cSure!\u201d inwardly cringing because you know it\u2019s a bad idea. And then within five minutes of being seated at the restaurant, your five-year-old goes into a sensory overload meltdown as you feared he would and is writhing on the floor screaming and so you leave, and a week later the date tells you he can\u2019t deal with the \u201cextended family.\u201d And since this is not the first time a love interest has ended a fledgling romance in this manner, you think to hell with it, why should I bother?\nAnd then your kids get older, and by some miracle and a good response to therapy, they begin talking more and have learned to filter some of their sensory issues and can actually sit in a restaurant for a bit, so you think maybe you\u2019ll give it another shot. And you get someone to watch the kids, and when the date comes over to pick you up, your now-verbal eleven-year-old son decides to suggest to the date that he should marry you. But the date decides to stick around for a few months anyway (after lecturing you about the inappropriateness of your son\u2019s suggestion, just in case you hadn\u2019t sensed it, even though he himself does not have any autistic children, nor any children whatsoever). And on one outing with your kids that you were apprehensive about doing (but did anyway to seem spontaneous), your autistic eleven-year-old gets lost and you spend half an hour looking for him, and then your SPD nine-year-old vomits all over the back seat of the fledgling boyfriend\u2019s new car that everybody was excited to ride in, and then he tells you that he\u2019s really not sure he can \u201ctake on\u201d the \u201cresponsibility\u201d of your children. And you think, Really? This again? Still? \u00a0\nAnd now your kids are adolescents and can actually stay home by themselves for a limited time so getting someone to watch them is no longer an issue. And you take an objective look at the situation and realize that getting someone to watch the kids was actually the smallest issue of all. It was getting someone to understand the kids, to accept them, that was the issue. It was getting someone who not only acknowledged the \u201cpackage deal\u201d nature of your situation, but who actually wanted to take it on. Those have always been the real issues, you realize, not getting someone to watch the kids or seeming spontaneous enough. And so you go on a lot of lunch dates until you meet someone who you think can understand your life and accept your kids and not be bothered by one son who warns against being seated too close together and still gets lost and the other son who only eats four things and occasionally\u00a0still vomits in the car.\nAnd you realize that as much as you worry about your autistic teen finding someone kind enough and understanding enough to date him and appreciate him and possibly have a relationship with him, you realize that deep down, you\u2019ve also been just as concerned about finding someone like that for yourself. And when you do find someone willing to fill that role, after over a decade of looking, you realize that only now are you able to truly appreciate that person.

{"date": "October 9, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tAutism and anger \u2013 two A-words that don\u2019t go together well. The combination ain\u2019t pretty.\nLast night, Nigel was angry. I had given him an ultimatum: You must clean your room or you can\u2019t have your friend spend the night this weekend as planned. This last resort came after a series of interventions on my part to make the room cleaning as easy as possible. I wrote instructions, broken down into steps, for him to refer to while cleaning. I offered the positive reinforcement of having his friend spend the night this weekend. He called the friend on Monday to invite him to spend Friday night, and as of Wednesday night, he had not lifted a finger to pick up his room. Urging him to get started was met with indifference. I mentioned that he would not receive his allowance until the room was clean. Not motivating enough. I removed the DVD player from his room. No worries. So, faced with letting it slide or hitting him where it hurts, I gave him the ultimatum. And I think the real reason he became angry is because he knows that I\u2019ll follow through with it.\nNigel has two ways of expressing anger \u2013 he destroys things in his room or becomes a mad dog. The fact that he chose not to destroy anything in his room last night told me that he didn\u2019t want to make the situation worse because, deep down, he knew that at some point he would have to actually clean his room. So, on some level, he still had control of himself. He just wanted to act like he didn\u2019t.\nThe first time Mad Dog entered our home, I was quite scared. Nigel, heading into adolescence, was having a lot of trouble filtering the sensations caused by his new hormones. I didn\u2019t know what to expect from him. He was hissing, growling, biting, and making death threats. I don\u2019t even remember how I got him to calm down \u2013 I think I just waited it out, holding my breath. Mad Dog has reared his head a few other times in the last couple of years. The death threats have subsided, but the rest of it is no picnic.\nAfter I told Nigel that he would have to cancel his sleepover unless he cleaned his room, Mad Dog came bounding out. He leaped around the living room, growling and hissing, jumping on the back of the couch where my boyfriend Rick and I were trying to watch a movie. I was not pleased. I tried herding him back to his room, at which point he threw himself on the floor and began biting my legs. My patience wearing thin, I left him there in the hallway and went to the bathroom to regroup.\nI came out a moment later to the sound of laughter. Apparently, Mad Dog had gone back out to the living room to jump on the back of the couch, and Rick deftly infused some humor into the situation. He grabbed Nigel and gave him a wedgie. That startled Mad Dog right out of him! Nigel went back to his room for a few minutes, and then he came out with a plan. He knew that shoving everything into the closet wouldn\u2019t fly, so he offered to bundle it in an old sheet and drag it into the storage room. I came up with a plan of my own. I told him that first he should put away all the clothing that was on the floor, and then we\u2019d consider using his sheet method. He said okay. After he\u2019d put away all the clothing, I went in and surveyed his room and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just put all the stuffed animals back on your bed?\u201d By the time he had done that, the piles on the floor looked much more manageable. I suggested he pick up all the DVDs. \u201cJust the DVDs,\u201d I said. Then, since it was bedtime, I suggested that he could do his sheet plan tomorrow, after he had picked up the books. He said okay.\nAnd so we managed to learn a few important things here at Teen Autism:\n1. Humor is a significant tool for diffusing anger.\n2. Allowing Nigel to come up with his own plan is an effective motivator.\n3. Compromise might actually\u00a0be possible.\n4. Bargaining is very productive.\n5. Mad Dog is vulnerable to surprise wedgie attacks.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/10/09/dealing-with-anger/", "title": "Dealing with Anger"},

How could he understand the subtlety and ambiguity of metaphor? I decided that simile would be an easier place to start, with its concrete formula for identification: a comparison of two things using \u201clike\u201d or \u201cas.\u201d His early attempts, tall as a tree and sticky like glue, lacked flair, but we kept at it.\nAfter a long day of homeschool, social skills class at the middle school, and chores, Nigel (who was probably up late last night) claimed he needed a rest before dinner.

So imagine my shock when it was discovered a few years ago that Nigel could actually handle game arcades. Not just the sounds of video games bleeping, but also louder shooting sounds, rolling skee-balls, flashing lights, and being jostled and bumped by strange people. Of course, this sensory processing ability occurred right around the time that he also became able to sit in restaurants. Something clicked and he was able to filter out the sensory issues that had previously been so agonizing for him. It was a relief for all of us. And it opened a lot of doors for activities in which he could participate.\nGoing to the local Family Fun Center turned out to be one of them. I was a bit nervous the first time I took him there, since the entrance takes you right through a noisy, bustling arcade, but I think my son\u2019s excitement cancelled out any sensory issues he might have experienced. He also had his form-fitting fleece hooded jacket on, and that helped to muffle the sounds. It amazed me to see him handle all the stimulation. After some time in the arcade, I took him outside to the go-karts. He had previously been a passenger on other amusement-park driving rides, but he was tall enough at age eleven to drive his own car, and very excited to do it. As we approached the go-kart area, I coached him about not crashing into the other cars, and to keep going in the same direction. I had purposely arrived first thing in the morning, hoping that there would be fewer people driving at the same time, and I was glad to see that my plan worked. The attendant let us through the gate and told us to take two cars in the front. As soon as Nigel climbed into his car, he took off! He just pushed the accelerator pedal and off he went! The attendant started yelling after him to stop, but Nigel didn\u2019t respond \u2013 he just kept going! I quickly informed the guy about Nigel\u2019s autism and told him that this was Nigel\u2019s first time driving and he didn\u2019t know to wait. The guy seemed to understand. He waited for Nigel to finish the lap and then flagged him over so that he could put on his harness. Then he continued for the remainder of the allotted time with me following in my car. Nigel smiled and laughed the entire time. Not only that, he drove just fine.\nThat was three years ago. Nigel is practically a pro go-kart driver now. He knows to put on his harness and wait for the attendant to say when to start. He doesn\u2019t crash into anyone. Furthermore, he even knows how to block other cars from passing him! We just went go-kart racing yesterday, and he beat me again! But the best part of all is how much he enjoys driving those go-karts. I loved being right behind him, seeing his huge smile every time we rounded a curve.\n\nFour people to take one 6-minute go-kart ride: $24\nEveryone, including Nigel, enjoying it: priceless.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rvfamilyfuncenter.com/index.php"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/10/13/driving-force/", "title": "Driving Force"},

That was disappointing. The year that I was twenty-six, I didn\u2019t get a big job I applied for, my son was diagnosed with autism, and my then-husband announced that he wanted to be separated. All rather disappointing (at least at the time).\nWe all have our own ways of dealing with disappointment. Some indulge in retail therapy, some take a hot bath, some tell themselves that something wasn\u2019t meant to be. Some get angry and frustrated, or sad. Some take it out on themselves. Disappointment is another emotion that autistic teens are faced with learning how to manage. Of course, all people must, but for someone who has trouble identifying and dealing with difficult emotions, it\u2019s that much harder.\nNigel\u2019s NT friend Riley was supposed to spend the night last night as a positive reinforcement for Nigel cleaning his room. He earned it, and he was really looking forward to it. Then Riley called to say that he hadn\u2019t fully recovered from an illness yet and couldn\u2019t make it. Nigel seemed okay at first and retained his composure on the phone, which impressed me, but afterward I could tell that he was definitely upset. He yanked his hair in his fists and shut himself in his room, where he proceeded to knock a bunch of stuff on the floor he had worked so hard to clean. \u201cI cleaned my room for nothing,\u201d he sneered.\nAfter a few minutes, I went in and sat with him on his bed. I acknowledged his disappointment. Then I gently reminded him of the exercise he had recently done in his social skills workbook called When Plans Change. In it, he learned to create a visual image of changing the plan in his head by removing the old plan, represented by a Post-It note with \u201cOld Plan\u201d written on it and stuck to his forehead, and applying a new plan (a Post-It note with \u201cNew Plan\u201d written on it). The new plan consisted of dinner out at his favorite Mexican restaurant, going out to get ice cream, and renting a movie of his choice. And the assurance that Riley would spend the night on a future weekend.\n\u201cNew Plan\u201d seemed to be an acceptable consolation prize, even though I could tell he was still having a tough time, still wishing his friend could be here. Last night he kept coming out of his room spouting random movie echolalia, which he usually does when stressed. Later, he started coming out of his room talking about bully revenge plans. I think he was displacing his disappointment about his friend not coming over onto a scapegoat of sorts, which seemed to help him. I was glad he found something that worked. Whatever way it rains on our proverbial parades, we all learn to deal with disappointment, whether it\u2019s by doing something to make ourselves feel better or by visualizing Post-It notes on our foreheads. And sometimes a little note helps more than we realize. It might even help us get what we want for Christmas.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Social-Success-Workbook-Instant-Homework/dp/1931704120/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1223759856&sr=1-2"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/10/11/when-disappointment-looms/", "title": "When Disappointment Looms"},

Live independently\n8 Percent\n\n\n2. Live independently but require minimal support\n42 Percent\n\n\n3. Live in a group home\n14 Percent\n\n\n4.

I know that my answer would vary depending on the age Nigel had been at the time I was asked. Between the ages of three and seven, I would have chosen #4, My child will probably never leave home. Between the ages of eight and thirteen, I would have chosen #3, Live in a group home. But now, as he nears fourteen, I might possibly choose #2, Live independently but require minimal support. Or, it might be #4 until his late twenties-mid thirties, and then #2.\u00a0 And then, as I look back at how far he\u2019s come and dare to dream about how far he might be able to go, I wonder if the possibility exists that in a few years I could actually answer #1, Live independently. As the years have gone by, his functioning has gone from fairly low to moderate to fairly high. What if he continues to improve? What is his true potential?\nAnd this brings me to my second question: At what point do we say that someone is high functioning? The definition is rather subjective. I have acquaintances who\u2019ve said to me, \u201cHow wonderful that Nigel\u2019s so high functioning!\u201d But I think, if he were so high functioning, wouldn\u2019t he be able to be mainstreamed? Wouldn\u2019t he be able to make it through a typical school day? At this point, he talks HFA (high functioning autistic). His sensory issues, so severe in the past, are now at a manageable level. So how do we quantify our child\u2019s level of functioning? Where is the high functioning threshold anyway? At what point do we know that our children have crossed it? And what does that mean for them and their future? Trying to make their way in this world that could easily take advantage of them? What does it mean for us, their parents?\nOf course, if Nigel were still non-verbal or still had severe sensory issues, I would not be asking these questions. I would choose answer #3 or #4, as I would have when he was younger. I would still think about his future, of course, and mine. I would obsess about finding a good facility for him. I know that it would not be easier, because I had been in those shoes for several years. But it would be different. My concerns about my son\u2019s future are different now than they were before he began reaching for the high functioning threshold, but no less worrisome, no less consuming.\nAnd so, regardless of our children\u2019s age, regardless of their functioning level, we all face the question posed by Natural Learning Concepts regarding our children\u2019s future. We all wonder and worry. Some parents\u2019 worries evolve and change, and some are unique to their own circumstances. But we all face the prospect of how autism will affect our children\u2019s futures. We all have our own suitcases to carry. And whether we cross that threshold or whether we\u2019re at the opposite end of the spectrum or somewhere in between, we still face this challenge. And that is no small feat.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nlconcepts.com?a_aid=6868cef2", "http://www.nlconcepts.com?a_aid=6868cef2"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/10/14/the-high-functioning-threshold/", "title": "The High Functioning Threshold"},

What I neglected to say was this: Even if Nigel doesn\u2019t progress any further, even if he hadn\u2019t progressed to the point where he is now, I would be fine with that. I hope for his progress, but not because I want him to change. I am so happy with him the way that he is, the way that he\u2019s always been. I hope for his continued progress because it would open more doors for him. It would enable him to experience more of life, and that is what he wants, and I want that for him. We all dream for our children. Autism doesn\u2019t put an end to that.\nAnd so this morning, having been up late thinking about what I had written, obsessing about the future, I came and sat down at my desk, my big L-shaped desk with all my projects spread out all over it, and my framed family photos of my loved ones smiling at me, and my soothing candles and bamboo, and my eyes fell on that little quote I had taped to the bottom of my monitor.

{"date": "September 28, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tParties are a bit of a conundrum for the extroverted autistic individual. Of course, I am not extroverted and I am not autistic, so this analysis is based on my (slightly biased) observations as the mother of such. Being extroverted, Nigel craves the fun social interaction of a party, especially when the party-goers include family and friends who know him and love him. But being autistic, he often needs relief from the very social interaction he so craves. And as a verbal autistic, he often finds that the topics he chooses to discuss can cause confusion or amusement (at his expense). Sometimes he unwittingly says something downright inappropriate or resorts to movie echolalia. It\u2019s tough needing to work so hard at something that\u2019s supposed to be fun.\nI watch him at a party at our house. Nigel\u2019s working the room, showing each person one by one his self-designed Lego mini-figure of JFK, discussing his theories on the assassination, and even thinking to ask those over the age of 45 if they remembered the day that it happened. He is trying to make connections with people the only way he knows how \u2013 talking about his interests and asking for others\u2019 opinions. He would do this all night if he could. But after a while, the din of a party will get to him, and he removes himself for a moment to take a break. If he doesn\u2019t, he will become over-stimulated and could have a meltdown. It\u2019s happened before. He knows this about himself, but sometimes I need to remind him. This time, he does it on his own. And then he\u2019s right back out in the thick of things. Back for more.\nI, meanwhile, hang back as much as possible at a party. This is especially difficult to do when it is being held at my house. So, I have devised a method of getting as much ready as possible before the guests arrive, making sure all the refreshments are accessible, and then I sit at the far end of my kitchen counter, visible if anyone needs me for anything and near enough to throw out a comment or two should the spirit move me, but removed a bit from the action. Unlike my son, who is making the rounds with his homemade spear from 10,000 BC and a Peruvian Chullo hat on his head that my father brought back for him as a souvenir from a recent trip. Later, guests will be wowed by his Terminator sunglasses, floating pumice rock, and knowledge of space exploration history. He is in his element, and I am impressed and proud.\nAnd then Nigel gets a little carried away, a little cocky, perhaps. Maybe he\u2019s thinking, \u201cI\u2019m working this party good. Who says I need a social skills class? I\u2019ve got it under control.\u201d He notices Mom sitting a little close to her boyfriend (who was just introduced to all the relatives tonight). Close enough to tease her about it. And then something flies out of his mouth in his loud voice. Something that brings the party to a grinding halt.\nNigel: \u00a0Mom, you\u2019re sitting too close to his crotch.\nMe: Nigel!\nNigel: That\u2019s okay, because I want to have a baby brother. I want you to have another baby.\nMe (about ready to pass out, not sure if I have the strength or wit to manage damage control): Shh!

{"date": "September 25, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tWhen Nigel was about six and seven and using some spontaneous speech, he would tell me when he wasn\u2019t comfortable with a situation. \u201cAll done rafting,\u201d he said when I took him rafting on a mild part of a local river. \u201cAll done doctor,\u201d \u201cAll done wash face,\u201d and \u201cAll done vacuum\u201d were heard frequently, or just \u201cAll done\u201d between hiccupping sobs when something really upset him. It is in this spirit that I attended his IEP meeting today.\nI know they mean well, the IEP team. Of course they do. One of them has known and worked with Nigel for ten years. But when I tell them the poignant story about Nigel doing art therapy in his yearbook, drawing ape faces on all the faces of the kids who had bullied him at that school, and the IEP team tells me that \u201ca lot\u201d of it was Nigel\u2019s \u201cperception\u201d that the kids were bullying him, it makes me want to scream. It makes me want to knock a few skulls, okay? And then they suggest that maybe in a couple of months Nigel might be able to come back part-time (since I am currently homeschooling him). So I try to diplomatically reply, \u201cNigel really does not want to set foot in this school again. It\u2019ll be all I can do to get him to agree to come to the once-a-week social skills class.\u201d\nIEP meetings tend to be the bane of every special needs parent\u2019s existence. Until just a few years ago, I had two kids on IEPs. I thought I was tough. I thought I could do an IEP in my sleep. Seven years ago, my children\u2019s father moved 700 miles away, and so I have attended these IEP meetings alone. And no matter what, no matter how many of these I have attended in the last eleven years, I still feel just as vulnerable. I still feel myself on the verge of tears, trying to hold it together, trying to convey to them No, it WASN\u2019T just Nigel\u2019s PERCEPTION that he was being bullied. How could they say that to me? After all that my child has been through? After all the calls they made to me at work, telling me I had to pick him up because of some behavioral issue they couldn\u2019t handle. Because the constant bullying had driven him to such an agitated state that he could not even function. He could not make it through the day. It was not just his \u201cperception.\u201d That much I knew, as I breathed in sharply and felt my heart rate increase and my blood race through my veins at 8:15 this morning. I just looked at the person who said it. And then I looked away.\nAfter that, we discussed his IEP goals, we talked about the social skills class, they asked how he was doing (much better now that he doesn\u2019t perceive himself to be bullied anymore, thank you!), and they provided some math and writing materials that will be helpful for homeschooling. We discussed the benchmark testing he will need to do in the spring. We touched on options for high school next year.\u00a0 We signed the papers. Said Thank you for coming. Went through the motions.\nBut at the end of the hour, as I walked out to my car, I realized that even though I had been upset by someone\u2019s insensitive remark, my mantra pulled me through. \u201cIn an hour this will be over, and Nigel\u2019s needs will be met.\u201d This is what I say to myself before every IEP meeting. And somehow, no matter what happens, it works. All done IEP.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/09/25/all-done-iep/", "title": "All Done IEP"},
{"date": "September 29, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tAt some point in the last couple of years, Nigel, like another skillful boy his age, learned to make toast. He has this routine of pre-slicing the butter so that it has softened by the time the toast pops up, placing the thin pats on the toast, waiting 30 seconds and then spreading them. \u00a0Then he actually wraps up the bread and butter and puts them away. It\u2019s one of the things he does perfectly. And until last week, it was the only thing he could cook. Not anymore!\nLast week I came home from work (I usually work from home so that I can homeschool him, but I go into the office on Fridays), and I could tell by the smell that something had been cooked. And not just toast.

And because I could not pinpoint what had caused his step backward, I worried that he might continue down that road.\nBut as I have come to learn, autism is nothing if not unpredictable. Inconsistent. And so I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when Nigel did really well at the meeting last night. He didn\u2019t interrupt anyone, he only got in someone\u2019s face once, and it was brief, he participated and paid attention. He even requested, appropriately, to show the other Scouts something he had brought with him. He needed to bring it in from the car, and the Scoutmaster said that he could do that near the end of the meeting.\nAnd that\u2019s when I got a little nervous. He wanted to show them a little stuffed animal toy that he had received for his recent fourteenth birthday. It was Gizmo, from the movie Gremlins, and he had barely let it out of his sight since he received it Friday night. He had been sleeping with it every night; he brought it with him to his social skills class on Monday. I knew that someone with an emotional age of eight or nine couldn\u2019t realize that typical twelve- to fifteen-year-olds would not find his little stuffed animal to be nearly as intriguing as he did. I wondered what sort of a response to expect from them.\nWhen the time came, Nigel went out to the car and retrieved Gizmo. He reentered the room with it hidden under his jacket and made a big deal out of keeping it a secret until he was ready to reveal it. Of course the boys were wondering what he had under his jacket. A fascinating geode? A live animal? They kept prompting him to show them, and finally he did. I held my breath.\n\nI needn\u2019t have worried. Once he identified what it was, they all said, \u201cThat\u2019s cool, Nigel,\u201d and he took it around the room so all of them could look at it, which they politely did. They did not speak to him in a patronizing manner. They did not roll their eyes or make disparaging remarks. They got it. They realized that this was something important to Nigel, and they were supportive. And I wanted to hug all of them.\nSo here\u2019s a big shout-out to the Scouts of Troop 535 and their parents: You guys are so great. You make Nigel feel accepted, and he appreciates it, and so do I.

After all, reading was what prompted us to want to be writers \u2013 we had read something we enjoyed so much that we decided to try our hand at it. Reading can evoke deep emotion and provide a wonderful escape. One of my favorite quotes (by Virginia Woolf) concerns the love of reading:\n\u201cI have sometimes dreamt that when the day of judgment dawns . . . the Almighty will turn to Peter and will say . . . when He sees us coming with our books under our arms, \u2018Look, these need no reward. We have nothing to give them. They have loved reading.'\u201d\nAnd so I was understandably ecstatic when my son, diagnosed with autism at age three, began reading six months later. I soon learned that it was called hyperlexia and that supposedly he did not comprehend what he read. But a lot of it he did comprehend. He started off by putting his wooden letter blocks together to form words (\u201cw-o-l-f\u201d when he wanted to watch Disney\u2019s Peter and the Wolf) and \u201cw-a-l-m-a-r-t\u201d when a trip to Wal-Mart was mentioned). He would read the words printed on his PECS cue cards and respond accordingly. Then he progressed to reading words that his teachers, therapists, and I would write for him when PECS was not enough (\u201cFirst finish work. Then play outside,\u201d and \u201cFirst dinner. Then more Lion King.\u201d) Soon I noticed him reading Dr. Seuss and Disney books on the couch, and he was reading in his mind because I saw his eyes move across the pages. He was four. By the time he was six years old he was tested to be reading at fifth grade level, yet his speech was still largely echolalic.\nI was just glad he was reading. Now, Nigel reads National Geographic issues cover to cover. (I walked into my office one night to find him with several issues spread out all over the floor and asked what he was doing. His response: \u201cI\u2019m just hanging out reading Nat Geos.\u201d I love how he came up with the abbreviation himself.) He reads truckloads of books on science, history, wars, different cultures, natural disasters \u2013 many types of non-fiction. Alas, very little fiction, which is my favorite.\nThe only fiction Nigel will read is a book that\u2019s been turned into a movie (like Jumanji or The Secret of NIMH). He did read The Cricket in Times Square (if there\u2019s a movie of that, he hasn\u2019t seen it), but it had animals in it, and he loves animals. He wishes they could talk. (And clean out their own litter boxes.)\nI wrote this post because I had noticed several incoming searches for \u201creading and autistic teens.\u201d \u00a0What do they like to read? The bottom line is that it depends on the teen\u2019s cognitive level and their individual interests. Some still like to read the books they read as young children for the comfort and familiarity they offer. Many autistic teens like books about animals, fiction or non-fiction. Some, like Nigel, love history, geography, and movies. Some might be more inclined towards math and computers. Some might even like to read instruction manuals or the backs of cereal boxes. If they\u2019re reading, it\u2019s all good.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperlexia"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/07/23/reading/", "title": "Reading"},

But stay with me . . .\nMy mother said that when I was a baby I would get on my hands and knees and bang my head into the headboard of my crib in a rhythmic, repetitive way. And I rocked. As a child I rocked myself on couches if there were no rocking chairs available. To this day I love to rock, I love the soothing element of the motion. Isn\u2019t that a form of stimming? Rocking and banging my head repetitively?\nApparently I was also resistant to touch, to contact. I am told that I didn\u2019t like to be held. Where have we heard this before?\nThis is why I believe that some people are genetically predisposed to autism. Even though I was not autistic (I talked very early and exhibited a high level of social awareness), I can see some faint characteristics in my infant and childhood self. The writing was on the wall. All it took was the combined genes of someone else who had been a bit like me, a dose of terbutaline in utero, and a whopping bombardment of thimerosol within the first few months of life and\u00a0 . . . voila! Autism.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/07/18/genes/", "title": "Genes"},

As we were en route, the sky clouded up quickly, and it started raining before we even got there. When we pulled up, I looked over at the go-kart area and could tell that they were not running. \u201cWell, guys, the go-karts are closed,\u201d I announced. \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Nigel said. \u201cWe can go in the arcade.\u201d Adaptability score: 1\nI don\u2019t know how Nigel filters out all the sounds, lights, and people in a busy arcade, but he does. I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s something that he really wants to do, so he\u2019s motivated. Or, it could be because there\u2019s so much going on that even his brain can\u2019t isolate all the sights and sounds, and so it\u2019s just one big bombardment to tune out. But somehow he\u2019s learned to deal with it. Adaptability score: 2\nNigel, having a lower emotional age than other 14-year-olds, has always enjoyed climbing and sliding on play structures. You know, the indoor ones that usually have a height limit of 48 inches, which Nigel surpassed a few years ago. He sometimes rationalizes: \u201cI can go on it because it\u2019s not crowded.\u201d But he is now at an age and size which makes it inappropriate for him to continue playing on the indoor play structures, and doing so could even get him in trouble with people who don\u2019t realize that he\u2019s an 8- or 9-year-old in a 14-year-old\u2019s body. He could be seen as a threat. So, I figured it was time to break him of this habit. He asked, as he usually does at the Family Fun Center, if he could go in Cactus Jack\u2019s Playhouse. I non-confrontationally posed that he might be too big for it, and I suggested that he ask if there was a height or age limit. He came back a moment later and said, \u201cTwelve and up. And since I\u2019m fourteen, I can go in.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s twelve and under,\u201d I said gently. \u00a0\u201cBut I really like it,\u201d he said in a quiet, forlorn voice. \u201cI know, honey, but you have to realize it\u2019s not built for kids your age.\u201d He looked down and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d Then he looked up and asked, \u201cWill you play\u00a0air hockey with me?\u201d Adaptability score: Bonus 10 points!\nSuch a \u201creasonable man\u201d my son is becoming.

{"date": "July 22, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tA friend of mine recently suggested that I identify and write about the three biggest areas of concern for parents of autistic children. I quickly determined my three, and they are probably universal.\n1) Safety\nOur children\u2019s safety is a huge life-long concern. We worry because they can have extreme responses to sensory issues, like darting into the street because a bug flew in their face or screaming and writhing on the floor in a public restroom because someone started the air hand-dryer. Our children are also vulnerable to being coerced into doing things that are dangerous or illegal because they are trusting and many of them want to have friends. We worry that they might be abused at some point in their lives, and worse, not be able to tell us. Some of our children have seizures, which can be deadly. We worry if our child leaves the house when unsupervised; some are runners who like to \u201cescape.\u201d We worry about our children injuring themselves or others when they lash out due to frustration or fear. We worry about how people out in the community will respond to them. Safety is definitely a primary concern, and parents must be vigilant.\n2) Education\nWe parents are equally concerned about our autistic children\u2019s ongoing education. We want to make sure that they are in cognitive-appropriate programs and that they have access to the various types of therapy that they need so that they can progress to their optimal level of development and functioning. If our children are mainstreamed, we constantly have to check in to make sure that their needs are being met, that they are not being bullied, and that they aren\u2019t just being sent to the library to watch videos. Our children\u2019s academic and social development greatly affects their potential, and we always want them to be happy, learning, and valued. This involves a great deal of parent advocacy.\n3) Future\nIt may only be an occasional thought for parents of younger autistic children (mostly because we were too busy trying to deal with the present), but once our children hit adolescence, it becomes a major concern. What does the future hold for my child? How will he be in adulthood? What happens when I\u2019m not around to care for him? These are all questions that entered my mind upon Nigel\u2019s initial diagnosis, and infrequently in the ensuing years. About a year or so ago I started to really wonder about his future, to think about it on a regular basis. I have concerns about how independent he will be, how he will navigate the community without my intervention, how he will interact with people. Most importantly, I want him to feel fulfilled with his life, to have a job that he enjoys and people around him who appreciate him. I want him to be happy. Of course, that is what all parents want for their children. But with autism in the picture, parents so often have to orchestrate the outcome, since in many cases we are heavily involved for the rest of our lives. Our concerns about our child\u2019s future become our champion cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/07/22/3-greatest-concerns/", "title": "3 Greatest Concerns"},

But #2, far more than the other three items, helps our children to feel valued. To feel like they matter. And, in a roundabout way, feeling that way will help them to succeed, and to feel comfortable and capable. Having real friends boosts self-esteem like nothing else. I have seen how happy my son feels when he is accepted and appreciated for who he is, and if I had to choose one thing out of that list for him to have all of his life, that is it.

{"date": "July 21, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tFor years I had a secret that I was reluctant to tell, and rarely did. After Nigel\u2019s diagnosis, I thought that people wouldn\u2019t believe it. But people here might, and so I divulge: I have always been fascinated by autism. I first read about it when I was eight years old and I used to read the twenty-five volume hardcover Encyclopaedia Britannica volume by volume. I would sit in the brown upholstered rocking chair in our living room, open up the large, heavy book in my lap, turn the crackly new pages, and smell the fresh paper-and-ink scent of a previously unread book. I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t read all of them cover to cover, but I read enough to learn all sorts of things. Autism was one of them.\nI became intrigued right away. I studied it throughout childhood and adolescence (although the only printed information I found was archaic), and in college I received my minor in psychology, stemming from my long-time interest in autism. Even at a young age, I wondered what caused it. In adolescence I wrote a story about a teenage girl who had autism, and she could talk, but her speech was echolalic. I didn\u2019t know about echolalia at the time; I hadn\u2019t even heard of the word. I just somehow knew that autistic people communicated that way. It was as if I had this innate understanding of autism. When Nigel was diagnosed at age three, however, at first the idea seemed impossible to me because he was so affectionate. The old stereotypes (and the archaic descriptions I read) really got in the way of recognizing it.\nMany parents whose child is diagnosed with autism will feel a need to grieve. The future of their family will be vastly different from that of most, if not all, people they know. They are fearful, not knowing what to expect, and their\u00a0response is only natural. Oddly, emotional as I am, I did not cry when Nigel was diagnosed. I have on many occasions since; for example, out of frustration and sadness for not being able to do things with my child that other people take for granted (going to the grocery store or a restaurant), and, in recent years, I\u2019ve cried because it pains me to see Nigel try so hard to fit in with his peers only to be laughed at and bullied. But I didn\u2019t cry when he was first diagnosed, and I\u2019ve often wondered if, in addition to it being a shock, maybe I subconsciously knew that I was destined to have an autistic child. Maybe all those years I spent reading about and studying autism, due to a childhood interest, was my subconscious mind prepping me, saying, \u201cStart wrapping your mind around this.\u201d\nIs that farfetched? I\u2019m fascinated by autism for most of my life and wind up having an autistic child? I don\u2019t know. I remember a chill came over me when Nigel\u2019s diagnosis was uttered. I was scared, it didn\u2019t seem logical, based on what I had read, but deep down I knew it was true. Some words etched themselves on my soul: This is my path. Somehow I have always known it.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/07/21/a-secret/", "title": "A Secret"},
{"date": "July 29, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tWriting about Nigel\u2019s experience in the barrel reminded me of a great organization called Surfers Healing. Those I know who surf say that surfing is therapy, and at Surfers Healing, it\u2019s therapy for autistic kids. This wonderful organization goes to both coasts to offer free surf camps for autistic kids, and the response is so positive. A recent testimonial on their site, posted by a parent, says \u201c[Her son\u2019s] comment on the ride home was that he wished the whole world was as comfortable as Surfers Healing events.\u201d Since Nigel loves boogie-boarding and body surfing so much, next summer I\u2019d love to have him participate in a Surfers Healing camp.\nI think it\u2019s the repetitive nature of the waves that makes the experience so soothing. That\u2019s one of the things I love about going to the beach, hearing the waves breaking. But I also love being out in the water, feeling the rhythmic sensation of the tide. The ocean is dynamic, full\u00a0of life and energy, and to tap into that is highly therapeutic. No wonder Nigel liked being in the barrel, the epitome of power and grace.

We\u2019ve camped a lot over the years, as a family and with Nigel\u2019s Scout troop, and Nigel\u2019s favorite part of camping, like most kids\u2019, is eating s\u2019mores.\nA few years ago we camped at Yosemite, and a month or so before the trip, I started to show Nigel pictures of Yosemite and told him that we\u2019d be camping there that summer. At the mention of camping, he asked, \u201cCan we have s\u2019mores?\u201d And I said, \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea! You\u2019ll have to remind me before we go to Yosemite.\u201d Nigel, after a few seconds, got a blank look on his face and said, \u201cBut I just did.\u201d\nI forgot that his mind interprets things so literally.

It was the next step on his quest to connect with people. He just didn\u2019t know how to\u00a0structure the questions.

We can type in anything and in mere seconds, dozens, even hundreds and thousands, of listings pop up in some configuration of what we typed. We could spend days reading all of them. And so, when someone finds this web site by typing \u201cteen homeschooled and doesn\u2019t want to learn\u201d into a search engine (as my blog tracking software indicated a few days ago), it amazes me.\nThe reason it amazes me is because, even though I have not yet written about it, that is what I have been experiencing recently with Nigel. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t want to learn anything, it\u2019s just that he only wants to learn what he wants to learn. He loves science, especially earth science and weather, but he is also interested in biology, chemistry, and even introductory physics. His favorite subject, of course, is history. His concept of the ideal learning approach is to sit on the couch and read National Geographics all day or, better yet, watch a DVD about whatever historical topic he\u2019s studying. \u201cThat\u2019s how I learn things,\u201d he says. He feels that there\u2019s no need for him to write an essay about it because it\u2019s all in his head. And on some level, I\u2019m sure it is all there. But I\u2019ve got to prepare him for high school. I\u2019ve got to teach him to write an organized essay, site sources, etc. For the time being, I\u2019ll say that he\u2019s resistant and leave it at that.\nHe is also highly resistant to learning math. Nigel, in an un-stereotypically autistic way, hates math. Numbers are good for historical dates, calendars, times of movie listings, how much a Lego set costs, phone numbers and addresses, but other than that he has no use for them. Why learn multiplication tables when we have calculators? \u201cLong division is for losers,\u201d he loves to say. \u201cI\u2019m going to destroy it.\u201d\nHe says he\u2019s going to \u201cdestroy education,\u201d too. And Charlemagne, since Nigel thinks that\u2019s who \u201cinvented\u201d it. He\u2019s going to go back in time and assassinate Charlemagne because he apparently had something to do with promoting education.\u00a0 This plan came about when I pointed out today that he is required by law to be educated. \u201cYou can be educated at Blank Middle School or here at home. Which do you prefer?\u201d \u201cNeither. I\u2019ll destroy education,\u201d he says, and purposefully presses down too hard on his pencil so the lead breaks.\nIt isn\u2019t supposed to go this way, I tell myself. He should appreciate that I\u2019m homeschooling him so he doesn\u2019t have to go to the school he hates. Doesn\u2019t he realize all the sacrifices I\u2019ve made as a single parent to be able to homeschool him? Of course not, and I can\u2019t expect him to. He\u2019s a kid, an autistic kid at that. But there\u2019s only so much I can take. Only so much talk of \u201cdestroying\u201d things, non-tangible things that can\u2019t be destroyed anyway. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d I tell him when I am at my wit\u2019s end, unable to try to reason with him any longer.\nAnd so, to the person who Googled \u201cteen homeschooled and doesn\u2019t want to learn,\u201d I say the following: \u00a0\nYou\u2019re in good company. Despair not. Take it one day at a time. I don\u2019t know if your teen is autistic or not, but mine is and that\u2019s how I manage things.

And yeah, some days we want to throw the math book across the room too. Some days we want to yell, \u201cThis isn\u2019t fun for me, either!\u201d But we just keep at it. Yes, it is hard.

Drops of blood splattered up to the ceiling, blood was smeared all over the mirror, sink, and floor, blood-soaked tissues filled the trashcan and spilled onto the floor, and wadded up towels encrusted with blood were wedged into the space between the towel bar and the wall. How on earth is this level of carnage caused by a simple bloody nose?\nI know I need to teach him to clean it up, but it is late, I am sick with the flu, and I decide to deal with it tomorrow. I go to bed wondering why he does this with his blood. I\u2019ve read articles written by parents whose autistic children handle their feces this way, and so I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s blood, and I\u2019m glad it\u2019s usually confined to the bathroom (the living room couch was stained once or twice). But why does he do it?\nI think blood fascinates him. During one of his bloody noses last year, Nigel stuck a small test tube up his nostril in an effort to collect his blood (and he was successful, apart from the mess). He said he wanted to test his DNA. For what, I have no clue. He was going through a Hulk movie-watching phase, watching the DVD every day for a week, so the test tube incident might have been motivated by that. Maybe he figures if he has such a profuse amount of blood on hand, he might as well do something with it.\nI need to buy stock in Spray \u2018n Wash, considering the amount of Stain Sticks that I go through, what with the bloody towels, clothes, and couch. Such is my life. With that sense of resignation, I took some Nyquil and crawled into bed. I slept well, random dreams of blood splatters notwithstanding. I got up late this morning and, noting the empty house, remembered that the boys\u2019 dad was taking them river rafting today. I still felt weak with flu as I trudged passed the bathroom and peeked in. It was clean.\nMost likely, their father had cleaned it, even though he doesn\u2019t live here. But he knew I was sick, so that was thoughtful of him. I still need to teach Nigel how to clean up his own bloody-nose carnage, but there will be plenty of other opportunities for that, I\u2019m sure. For now, I better get out the Stain Stick. The towels got it pretty bad this time.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.spraynwash.com/product.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/08/14/blood-and-noses/", "title": "Blood and Noses"},

I do that every day, of course, but today I was reminded of the unfortunate truth that all humanity shares: we never know how much time we have.\nThe son-in-law of one of my friends had a massive stroke and died today. He was thirty-three years old. Thirty-three! He leaves behind his wife (my friend\u2019s daughter), their five-year-old daughter, three-year-old son, and unborn third child.

All I can do is remember, as I do when I hear about a sudden death or drive by the scene of a horrible accident, that our time with those we love could end at any moment. Morbid, yes, but also motivating. It\u2019s the kind of thing that makes you want to hold your kids (if they\u2019ll let you), call up your parents and siblings, and tell everyone who matters in your life how much you appreciate them.\nI think of all the bad days I\u2019ve had in the past year alone, the frustrated helplessness of dealing with meltdowns, school districts, doctor appointments, insurance, finances, and everything else about life that\u2019s stressful, everything that makes me loathe my day.

I don\u2019t ever want to take that for granted.\nThe time that we have is the only time that we have.

{"date": "August 19, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tWe have been waist-deep in Birthday-Induced Toy Envy and Younger Brother Control Issues. Far be it for me to think that this problem might have abated by now, but apparently twelve- and thirteen-year-olds are just as susceptible. Only now they are bigger and hormonal. And they\u2019re not embarrassed bickering in front of their friends.\nFor his birthday this past weekend, Aidan received a toy that has flown off the local toy store shelves: Transforming Wall-E. His father had purchased it a month earlier in LA and brought it up to Oregon for the party. Nigel fell in love with it, and Aidan exploited that by not letting Nigel hold it. This is difficult territory for me for several reasons.\n\n\nI want Aidan to share, but I don\u2019t want it to be forced.\nHe already accuses me of favoring Nigel.\nAidan himself has SPD and I can\u2019t expect commendable behavior from him in a sensory-overloaded situation (like a party).\nNigel can learn patience about getting to hold his brother\u2019s new things, but I certainly can\u2019t expect commendable behavior from him in the same sensory-overloaded situation.\n\n\nSo Nigel kept nagging and Aidan kept refusing and Nigel\u2019s behavior was escalating, but I was distracted getting dinner ready for a bunch of adolescent boys and couldn\u2019t intervene. Finally, I had them all sit at the kitchen table, hoping the pizza and root beer would be enough to distract Nigel, but it was too late. He was in meltdown mode, clenching his fists, gritting his teeth, and growling. \u201cNigel, relax and eat your pizza,\u201d I calmly suggested. \u201cRRRRRRAAAOORRRR!!!\u201d he growled in the face of the boy seated next to him. Fortunately, I was nearby and was able to grab Nigel as he lunged at the poor boy (a wonderful NT friend who has witnessed Nigel\u2019s meltdowns before and still agrees to come to our home). I managed to walk Nigel to his room as he growled, hissed, and clawed at me, his eyes wide with a combination of rage and fear. I reminded him that he needed to calm himself before he could finish eating and\u00a0hang with his friends, and then I went back to the kitchen to apologize.\nThe friend whom Nigel had roared and lunged at asked if Nigel was okay, bless his compassionate heart. I thanked him for being so understanding. When I went to check on Nigel about fifteen minutes later, he had shredded a file folder, but he was de-escalating. I could tell he wanted to rejoin his friends because he was lying on the floor on his back, with most of his body outside of his bedroom door, and he was quietly talking to himself. Five minutes later, he was running around with his friends, laughing.\nThe next day, he came to me and asked if I would buy him his own Wall-E toy. I told him that he could use his allowance to buy it, but that all the local stores were sold out, so we would need to order it online. He flopped down on the chair in my office and said, \u201cThey\u2019re like a flying pack of locusts, taking everything they can get! If only they could let me have a chance!\u201d This was said with much more emotion than his usual flat tone. \u201cWho?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe store customers?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d said my son, victim of consumerism.\nAnd Aidan, I\u2019m happy to say, finally relented. Last night, the three of us were relaxing on the couch watching a movie. Nigel diplomatically requested to hold Wall-E for \u201conly a minute.\u201d Aidan gave him three.

Now that he is nearing fourteen, Nigel has adjusted to the hormones that began coursing through his body last year. He no longer growls at me (unless he\u2019s having a meltdown). Now he has discovered that these hormones can be channeled into something more productive: obsessing about girls. In fact, perhaps I should re-categorize this post under Obsessions.\nBut no, this is no ordinary Obsession of the Week. This is Nature Running Its Course. And I am glad I had already\u00a0registered\u00a0to attend\u00a0this upcoming seminar.\nWe have some friends visiting from out of state this week who are staying at a local motel with a pool, which was good planning on their part since it got up to 108 degrees. I took the boys over to visit them at the pool, where they had fun with their friend who is Aidan\u2019s age. At one point, two girls about Nigel\u2019s age entered the pool, and that was it. While Aidan and friend blithely continued their goggle-clad shenanigans, Nigel made it a point to remove himself from their presence and began showing off diving near the two girls. He would come up for air near them, and I, Mama Bear, became incensed when the girls rolled their eyes and turned away. Be nice! I wanted to yell. Give him a chance!\nThen Nigel got smart. He enlisted the help of someone who had once been a girl. That\u2019s when he came over to me in my corner of the pool and said, pointing, \u201cThose two look attractive.\u201d He continued with, \u201cI feel a little anxious. Is it common for males to feel anxious about mating?\u201d Oh, my son. \u201cTry not to point, honey. Yes, it\u2019s common for boys to feel anxious about meeting girls. But the term \u2018mating\u2019 usually refers to animals.\u201d\nNigel: Oh. [makes a swimming motion] Maybe I should show them my moves.\nMe: Usually girls just like it better if you talk to them. You can tell them your name, and then say, \u2018I just wanted to say hi.\u2019\nAnd then, oh, this was so sweet, he went over to them and said, \u201cHi. Name\u2019s Nigel.\u201d (That\u2019s exactly how he said it!) The girls said hi and introduced themselves, and then Nigel said, \u201cThat\u2019s my mom over there,\u201d and pointed at me! The girls waved to me and I waved back. Part of me wonders if Nigel has learned that if he lets kids know that his mom is nearby, they will be nicer to him. And that is usually what happens. But maybe he couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say to them right then. Maybe he did it for some other reason. I\u2019ll probably never know, but that\u2019s okay.\nWhat matters is that for the remainder of the afternoon, whenever I saw Nigel near the girls, it appeared that they were being nice to him. Thanks, girls! Whether my presence motivated them or not, at least they learned that if at first someone seems a little different, they might not be so bad. A little patience goes a long way, especially in the beginning stages of dating (or \u201cmating,\u201d as Nigel would say).\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.oregonautism.com/register.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/08/18/assisted-wooing/", "title": "Assisted Wooing"},

{"date": "September 2, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tFirst days of school are nerve-wracking for lots of people, but especially for those with Sensory Processing Disorder. Most ASD people have some type of SPD (or several), but there are also many people with SPD who do not have autism. Aidan is one of them.\nIn the beginning, of course, I did not know this, but early on I thought he might have something I read about called \u201clow sensory threshold.\u201d He cried when I held him, he cried when I put him down, he cried in the baby swing, he cried in the car, he cried in stores, and he cried at home. He cried about 80% of his waking life. I did not know what to do for this child. The crying was so extreme that it prompted his two-year-old autistic brother to speak one of his first words: \u201ccying.\u201d He was trying to say \u201ccrying\u201d but couldn\u2019t get the \u201cr\u201d sound. \u201cYes, Aidan is crying,\u201d I would tell Nigel.\nAidan was about one and a half when Nigel was diagnosed with autism. At the time, I thought about the fact that Aidan was also not making any attempts to talk and had very sensitive hearing, like Nigel. I wondered if Aidan also had autism. There were many who suggested that Aidan was simply mimicking his older brother, but the signs were there even when Nigel was elsewhere. Nigel\u2019s autism was more on the severe side as a young child, fairly obvious once diagnosed, so if Aidan did have some level of autism, I thought it might have been PDD-NOS. Trying to be objective, I looked at the differences in my sons\u2019 behavior. Aidan made eye contact. He knew how to play with toys. He did not stim. He was just always crabby about something. So PDD-NOS did not seem correct. But what, then?\nWhen Aidan was three years old I was able to enroll him in the same early intervention program that had been so beneficial for Nigel. The therapists evaluated Aidan and informed me that he had problems with sensory integration (SPD hadn\u2019t been coined at the time) and a developmental delay in language. They provided OT and speech therapy, which seemed to\u00a0help him. But it wasn\u2019t until he was five that Aidan seemed to tolerate his body and his surroundings better. He finally seemed happy.\nAidan continued to receive speech therapy until he was almost ten, and I could tell he was glad when that was behind him. He is now IEP-free (yes, I did the happy dance when I left the last meeting, because now I only have one child with an IEP) and does quite well in spite of the fact that he is the pickiest eater in all of southern Oregon (at least) and hates wearing shoes because \u201cthey smash my feet.\u201d He constantly complains about smells that no one else smells, he wears the same clothes for days on end because they\u2019re the only ones he feels comfortable in, can\u2019t stand having his hair brushed, gets carsick, and won\u2019t tie shoelaces or ride a bike. But at least he no longer cries 80% of the day!\nAnd so I was a bit concerned about Aidan\u2019s first day at a new school. School in general can be a pain for SPD kids due to the potential for sensory overload. I drove Aidan this morning so he wouldn\u2019t have to \u201cprocess\u201d the bus yet, and I think that helped to ease him into the first day. He said the lockers aren\u2019t so bad, and he assured me that he didn\u2019t buy anything at the vending machines. He didn\u2019t get lost, and he got on the right bus to come home. Best of all, he didn\u2019t get carsick!\n\u00a0\nAdded 9/13/08: an informative\u00a0SPD site \u2013 click here\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sensory-processing-disorder.com/index.html", "http://www.squidoo.com/spd"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/09/02/first-days-and-sensory-processing-disorder/", "title": "First Days and Sensory Processing Disorder"},
{"date": "August 21, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nThe subtitle of this insightful yet practical book is \u201cAutism as a Source of Wisdom,\u201d and author Olga Holland offers that and more. Many autism-parent memoirs are beautifully thought-provoking, and enjoyable to read, but don\u2019t present much in the hands-on, getting-through-the-day department. The Dragons of Autism eloquently and effectively addresses both of these areas.\nHolland possesses an analytical mind which enables her to invent and apply various approaches to managing her son\u2019s behavior and helping him adapt to situations that aggravate his sensory issues. She is no stranger to meltdowns (called tantrums in the book), having dealt with her son\u2019s episodes that occurred several times a day. A large portion of the book is devoted to damage control strategies as well as possible prevention techniques. She discusses the technique of Buying Time as a long-term method of re-training problematic behavior or enforcing house rules (such as bedtime). Holland goes on to describe the importance of schedules and having rituals to enforce them. She empathizes that yes, it is time-consuming for parents of autistic children to organize and maintain a schedule in written form, but she advises, \u201cLook at it as a craft \u2013 a part of the craft of raising an autistic child.\u201d I think that\u2019s the perfect way to describe it \u2013 a craft that we become better at as the years go by.\nHolland includes plenty of descriptions of her son\u2019s characteristics and behavior, and I found it both engaging and affirming to recognize so many of them in my own son, as I\u2019m sure many parents would. This book is helpful not only for parents of younger autistic children looking for ways to manage meltdowns/tantrums, but also for parents of older autistic children. Most of us still have to deal with meltdowns, even though now they may occur for different reasons than when our children were younger. Holland provides effective strategies using empathy and creativity that are both helpful and humane. I\u2019ve referred back to this book many times in the five years that I\u2019ve owned it, and will continue to.

It\u2019s like I\u2019ve got this radar, and I\u2019m sure other long-time autism parents sense that as well. There\u2019s a difference between a \u201cterrible twos\u201d tantrum and a sensory-overload meltdown. There\u2019s the unmistakable taking an adult\u2019s hand over to the refrigerator to open the door to get something rather than asking or pointing. The lining up of toys, the not responding to questions or comments. And yes, these are rather stereotypical signs. But it\u2019s the child\u2019s presence, and face, that I recognize more than anything.\nA while ago I attended a child\u2019s birthday party with a friend. It was for his co-worker\u2019s three-year-old son, with many friends and family members present. Within minutes of observing this little boy, I knew that he had autism, not just by his mannerisms and the signs, but by his face. It was so familiar, and my blood turned to ice because I knew that his parents didn\u2019t know. A few moments later, I turned to look at my friend, someone who had spent much time around my son over the years, and my friend\u2019s eyes were wide. He knew, too. \u201cI think he has autism,\u201d my friend said quietly to me.\nI felt strange. I was not close to these people. How could I go up to them and say, \u201cI think your son has autism\u201d? Or even the less-shocking, \u201cHave you looked into speech therapy?\u201d I was torn because I felt like I should do something to steer them toward early intervention, and to somehow convey to them that I understood. But it was not my place. I was an outsider.\nI continued to observe the little boy and his family. There was so much love and acceptance, and so much accommodation of the autism that they didn\u2019t know about. Was I obligated, as a seasoned autism parent, to say something? Part of me thought so. What if they knew something was different about their son? What if they were searching for answers? But a larger part of me just realized that, as a stranger, it wasn\u2019t my place. It was a birthday party. I told my friend to give them my number if, in the future, his co-worker approached him to say that his son was diagnosed with autism.\nThe radar will always be with me, and I\u2019m sure that other situations will occur throughout my life in which I find myself faced with the \u201cshould-I-say-something\u201d dilemma. It comes with the territory. But so does a lot of support, knowledge, and understanding that I can offer down the line, when they\u2019re ready.

Jonathan didn\u2019t respond, his parents didn\u2019t respond; I think everyone was waiting for me to jump in. It had never before occurred to me to talk to Nigel about autistic savants. I had never thought that his hyperlexia qualified as a savant skill. Sure, it was astounding at the time, but the sources I checked do not include it as a sign of Savant Syndrome.\nMe: A few autistic people have skills like computing difficult math problems in their heads, playing music very well, painting or drawing something in great detail, and memorizing lots of information. They\u2019re called autistic savants. But not every autistic person is a savant. In fact, most are not.\nNigel: Good.

Being an extrovert, Nigel loves the friendship theme of the movie, and being autistic, he appreciates the befriending of the misunderstood, cognitively challenged character, Sloth. According to Urban Dictionary, \u201cgoonie\u201d means \u201coutcast\u201d or \u201cgeek,\u201d but also \u201cgood friend or homie.\u201d Nigel considers himself a goonie.\nAfter school today, he invited his NT friend Riley over to watch the movie with him. Nigel and Riley have been friends for six years, and I\u2019m sure he has seen The Goonies with Nigel on several different occasions. Yet Riley comes over and hangs out, accepts the fact that Nigel talks and narrates throughout the movie, and just lets him be who he is. And of course, that is what good friends do. We all have our quirks, and some require a little more patience than others.

I didn\u2019t like it, of course, but I did what was expected of me. I had read stories about kids growing up in the country having many more chores than I, so I figured my lot wasn\u2019t so bad.\nNigel sees it differently. He balks at the few chores I have him do, complaining about slave labor and communism. \u201cCleaning rooms is for nerds,\u201d he says. Cajoling, begging, and trying to reason with him (\u201cEveryone has responsibilities,\u201d I say) is usually unsuccessful. So I came up with a plan:\n1) Create a chart \u2013 a visible reference, like the schedules used in his early intervention classes. It lists what he does when, each day. It has spaces for star stickers or checkmarks to indicate when chores are completed.\n2) Offer rewards \u2013 positive reinforcement for completing chores. He\u2019s a teen, so it has to be something that will really motivate him. Two things he loves the most: renting movies and having friends spend the night. So when he receives a certain number of star stickers, he can rent a movie or have a sleepover.\n3) Withdraw privileges \u2013 negative consequences for not completing chores. Two things he would miss: watching movies in his room every day and having computer time. For each day a chore is not completed, he will lose time doing what he enjoys.\nThis is an experiment \u2013 I\u2019ll report back with how it goes!

{"date": "July 8, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tDevelopment sometimes seems so elusive and immeasurable. When you\u2019re with your child every day, it is often difficult to see any development. For me, it becomes more apparent when Nigel returns after visiting his father for seven weeks every summer. It is then that I notice changes in development. Some are subtle, such as a slight increase in speech, and some are more obvious, such as being two inches taller. Every year Nigel progresses, whether it is obvious or not.\nI keep a file (several, actually) of his school records, IEP reports, and my own writing describing his development over the years. I have been looking through the files this week and am enjoying reading about his development, marveling at how far he has come. This is an excerpt from \u2018Nigel at Six:\u2019\nI had intended to start writing this sooner. Pictures are not enough to remember these early years. Videos help immensely, but they do not capture thoughts and dreams, concerns and hopes.\nAll people change and grow, but I think I will spend my entire life learning about Nigel. Who is this little boy? Part genius, part tough, all loving. He has been with Child Development Center for two years now, and I can communicate with him levels above how I did when he started. He is a wondrous person, a gentle soul. Trusting, yet fearful of new situations. I can\u2019t explain to him why he needs to sit at the table in restaurants and stay near me in the grocery store. Of course, I must remind myself that it has gotten better. He understands more of what I tell him, but too often I don\u2019t \u00a0think of what to tell him until it is too late. Last time we tried to eat in a restaurant, he went up to some other patrons at their table, got right in their faces and proclaimed, \u201cBalto!\u201d because he had watched that video earlier in the day.\nHe is starting to use pronouns now, usually at home where he is comfortable, although he confuses which one to use when, \u201cI\u201d for \u201cyou\u201d and vice versa. We are still hearing nonsensical words, words he uses when he\u2019s trying to imitate a line from a video and he doesn\u2019t know what was actually said. For example, in The Lion King when Simba tells Zazu \u201cHurry!\u201d in an urgent voice, because he needed help. Nigel thought it was said in an angry voice, so whenever he\u2019s angry, he yells, \u201cUrr-reee!\u201d and has for about two years now. Or he would say, also in anger, \u201cIt\u2019s my gun, you\u2019ve got no right to take it!\u201d from the Swiss Family Robinson. Fortunately that was short-lived. Another good one was from the Scooby-Doo video. When Aidan split his chin open, we had to go to the doctor for stitches, and the regular doctor had just moved to a new location. So we got to the new office and were just about to walk in the front door when Nigel stopped and said, \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d as Shaggy had said when they were about to go into a haunted house. Nigel had used the phrase in perfect context as a way to indicate his fear about a new situation.\nHe\u2019s even come up with some phrases on his own, emerging spontaneous, non-echolalic speech, which is wonderful. When I got back from a three-day trip to Paris, he emptied my backpack and filled it with his own shoes and clothes, put it on and walked around the room saying, \u201cNigel go to Paris. Nigel is tripping [meaning, going on a trip].\u201d He has learned in school to comment whenever someone participates by saying, \u201cGood catching,\u201d \u201cGood throwing,\u201d \u201cGood drawing,\u201d \u201cGood sitting down,\u201d and when he can\u2019t describe something specifically, he says, \u201cGood job in doing,\u201d which I love.\nAnd the boy who taught himself to read at three and a half is sounding out words he doesn\u2019t even know. Yes, it\u2019s hyperlexia, but at least he shows cognitive strength in that. Unfortunately, he seems to have difficulty with holding pens \u2013 even fat ones \u2013 and trying to write. He is very resistant. He loves to watch other people write, but he freaks out if I try to put my hand over his to get him to do it. It\u2019s a shame, because I think that once he learns to write, that will liberate him to no end. \u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/07/08/assessing-development/", "title": "Assessing Development"},
{"date": "July 6, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tEven though recent reports put the divorce rate down to its lowest since 1970, I had read various quotes that the divorce rate when autism is involved is as high as 80%. I took a look around online and found a source which puts the rate at 85-90%! Scary and sad. Personally, I don\u2019t believe that having an autistic child led my ex-husband and me to seek a divorce; there were plenty of other factors involved. But the fact remains that ten months out of the year, I am a sole parent (by that I mean that the other parent is only available by phone). And judging by the statistics, there are many other single autism parents out there as well. How do we do it? \nThe quick answer to that question is support. But there are several other elements that contribute to the successful single parenting of an autistic child. This is what I have learned:\n1) You must have emotional support. Look first to your child\u2019s other parent. A half-and-half joint custody arrangement may be too difficult for your autistic child to process, so be creative in your approach. But do try to plan for your child(ren) to spend some time with both parents each week so that the custodial parent can get a break and the non-custodial parent can spend some time with the child(ren). Do whatever you can to quickly get past any negativity with your ex-spouse. Not only will this be better for your child(ren), it will make things so much easier for you. \u00a0In the event that your ex-spouse lives far away or for other reasons cannot or will not be involved, you need other sources of support. Look to relatives and friends, and if you are truly isolated, you may want to consider relocating closer to those who can help you. If that\u2019s not possible, look up respite care in your area.\n2) You need time for yourself. This is why respite care is important if you do not have an ex-spouse or family and friends nearby. Giving yourself a break will help you to recharge and ultimately be a better parent. My time to rest and recharge is during the summer, when my sons are visiting their father in Los Angeles for seven weeks. Of course, I would rather have that broken up into smaller increments at more frequent times throughout the year, but it\u2019s not possible. So, during the other ten months of the year, once in a while I have a family member or a friend from Nigel\u2019s Scout troop watch him, Aidan goes to a friend\u2019s house, and I take a much-needed break.\n3) Try to organize your life. It really helps to get through the day, and the week, if your therapy appointments and errands are noted in one place, your keys and wallet/purse are always kept in the same place, and you schedule certain household tasks on certain days of the week. I plan out meals a week in advance and do my grocery shopping once a week. I started doing this about a year ago, and it makes that element of running a household so much easier, plus it\u2019s healthier and it saves money. Two great sources for helping you to organize your life are The Simple Dollar and Real Simple Magazine.\n4) Exercise when you can. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to go to the gym, unless that\u2019s the only thing that works for you and you have the means to do so. If your child can handle a walk around the block, get out and do that. If not, try doing yoga at home, and try getting your child(ren) to do it with you. Exercise is important not just for the physical health reasons, but also for emotional and mental health. It\u2019s essential for stress release, something all autism parents need.\n5) Cultivate (or develop) creative interests. Writing saves my sanity and helps me retain my sense of self. Anyone can benefit from having a creative pursuit, but for single parents, that outlet can become a lifeline of sorts. The best thing to do is to come up with something you can do at home, either with your child(ren) or while they are otherwise occupied (watching a video, for example). If you love to cook or bake, throw yourself into it: research recipes, try out new ones, or develop your own. Try getting into painting or drawing, photography, needlework or other craftwork, sewing, woodwork, designing, music, poetry, plants, gardening, computer programming, or anything you might be passionate about. It\u2019s good for the soul, and it reminds you that there is more to your life than day-to-day life.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.disaboom.com/Living/parentingandfamily/for-better-or-worse-and-kids-with-disabilities.aspx", "http://www.thesimpledollar.com/", "http://www.realsimple.com/realsimple/homepage/flash/0,23022,,00.shtml"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/07/06/single-parenting-with-autism/", "title": "Single Parenting with Autism"},

Today marks the half-way point of my sons\u2019 summer visit with their father for seven weeks.\u00a0 They return on August 1, and I am longing to hear their voices and footsteps fill the house again.\nI remember when I was growing up in the seventies I would read books and see movies from the fifties and sixties about kids going away to camp for the summer. It was for much longer than one or two weeks; it was like, two months. Remember the original Parent Trap? They were gone for so long they were able to fool their parents when they got back! It just seems like that was the thing to do then \u2013 go to camp for the summer. I never did as a child. And although I wondered about it, I was glad that I didn\u2019t have to go. I like the outdoors, but I would miss home. And what about the parents? Did they want to send their kids to camp, or did they do it because it was the socially acceptable thing to do? I try to imagine what that was like.\nSo I pretend that my boys are away at camp. They\u2019re at Beach Camp. I just talked to them last night, and it sounds like that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing the most, what they enjoy \u2013 going to the beach. They both like to boogie-board, which is amazing to watch. I saw them do it when I visited them in LA three and four summers ago. \u00a0It is wonderful to watch your autistic child excel at something. It\u2019s wonderful to watch any child excel at something, autistic or not, but there\u2019s more gratitude concerning the autistic child. Because not too many years ago I wondered if mine would enjoy doing things like that, would enjoy anything other than watching Disney videos and lining up Hot Wheels cars end to end along the back of the couch and leaning his head to one side to stare at them. Yes, I am grateful that my autistic child has learned to boogie-board, and he likes it.\nI have much to be grateful for. I think that is the key to getting through the next three and a half weeks of missing my sons. I\u2019ll keep in mind all the things I appreciate about them, what makes them special as individuals.

Just a month before, he refused to hold any writing utensil, as he had been doing since age three when we first tried to get him to scribble; he seemed to have an aversion to holding pens, pencils, crayons, and markers. But now, at six, he has begun. Being a bit of a perfectionist, he gets very frustrated with himself because he has trouble making the letter G, both big and small. But he perseveres, and now, just three months later, he writes full sentences, short \u201cletters,\u201d even. (\u201cDear mom, Mom get string cheese, Love mom\u201d \u2013 I\u2019ve tried to tell him that he needs to say \u201cLove, Nigel\u201d on his letters so that the people know they\u2019re from him, but I guess he thinks, Why wouldn\u2019t\u00a0you know who it was from? I just handed this to you, so you must know it\u2019s from ME.)\nHe has also started drawing for the first time, which is fabulous. The first things he drew were little cars with smiley faces. I will always remember how happy I was when he started writing and drawing. The first night he did, he came to me and asked me to \u201cwrite a letter to Tigger.\u201d I told him I was washing dishes and I would do it as soon as I was finished. A few minutes later, I turned around and there he was at the kitchen table, hunched over a piece of paper, writing diligently, struggling with the Gs in Tigger. I looked over his shoulder just as he was finishing, and saw that he had written, \u201cDear Tigger, jumps note, Piglet and Pooh.\u201d He put it in an envelope because he wanted to mail it to him.\nSince then, Nigel has been writing and drawing every day. He went through a sign-making phase. He put up signs all over the house saying things like, \u201cWarning: Do not let mom out of the house\u201d on the back door, \u201cNo children allowed\u201d inside the front door of Aaron\u2019s [his father\u2019s] house, \u201cNo smoking,\u201d on Aaron\u2019s closet door, \u201cReward: Do not let dogs out of the cage\u201d on his and Aidan\u2019s bedroom door, and several \u201cMissing: Stuart Little\u201d signs all over the living room when he couldn\u2019t find his Stuart Little video. Currently, he has been drawing traffic lights and houses. He also recently drew an adult male lion and a lion cub, and when I asked him who it was, he said, \u201cSimba and his dad.\u201d I initially thought that Nigel\u2019s writing and drawing would be a way to communicate his needs, but it has revealed more about his emotions and priorities than I ever would have imagined.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/07/13/learning-to-write/", "title": "Learning to Write"},
{"date": "July 10, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tMore from \u201cNigel At Six:\u201d\nWe moved into a new house a few months ago. It\u2019s on almost half an acre, with lots of trees and even a playhouse in the backyard. The boys really seem to like it; for the most part they\u2019ve adjusted well to the change. The only difficulty Nigel\u2019s had since we moved in happened about two months after we moved in when the landlord, without notifying us, had bark chips put in areas of the front yard as a landscaping element. I knew Nigel would initially have a problem with it, because it was new. I had just gotten home with the boys on a Saturday afternoon after they had spent the night at their father\u2019s house. Nigel got out of the car and immediately began trampling the bark, shuffling and dragging his feet through it, sending it flying. Brian [my then-boyfriend] immediately started lecturing Nigel, not realizing that it was Nigel\u2019s way of adjusting to something new. I tried to tell Brian that this was Nigel\u2019s way of learning about something foreign (What is it? What is it doing there, when it wasn\u2019t there the last time he was in the front yard?). I explained to Brian that Nigel\u2019s anxiety level goes up when he doesn\u2019t recognize something, especially in his own home. \u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t make it right for him to destroy something that somebody worked on all day,\u201d Brian said, totally missing my point. Nigel could not understand that someone had spent time arranging the bark. He was just trying to assimilate it into his world the only way he knew how. I told Brian that probably tomorrow Nigel wouldn\u2019t even touch the bark; it would no longer be foreign to him. (I was right.) The one thing Nigel could understand was that in dragging his feet through the bark, he had made a mess, and when I pointed that out to him, we got a broom and he helped sweep it up.\n[Next I wrote about our experience with trying the GF/CF diet.]\u00a0 . . . There may be supplements he can take to alleviate some of the symptoms (of autism), which of course I intend to look into as soon as I can. Sometimes I berate myself, thinking, why wait? Why not now, instead of writing this? Why not do everything I can to fight this? I don\u2019t think I have an acceptable answer. There are many components of my answer. One part is because I\u2019m so tired; I don\u2019t want autism to run our lives (but if I just let it be, then it is running our lives, isn\u2019t it? It might seem that way to some. But to me, when we\u2019re at home, we function as a family at a near-normal level. Or at least, it feels nearly normal, and that\u2019s good. It\u2019s only in public that problems arise. So it\u2019s almost easy to be comfortable with it in our daily lives). But mostly I don\u2019t fight it because I seem to innately know that Nigel\u2019s autism cannot be \u201ccured,\u201d at least not by current methods which seem to cure some types of autism. I know that Nigel will learn academically, and he will eventually learn about autism and how it affects him. In his daily life, he\u2019ll work with it, and he will succeed on his own terms.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/07/10/adjusting/", "title": "Adjusting"},

There are moments, yes, that I can just enjoy the life we do have, the accomplishments he has made, and for a moment convince myself that our lives are not defined by autism. I can usually find some time at home each day when I realize that we have all been functioning at our own version of normal, and everything is good. Even just for ten minutes.\nBut Nigel is learning and growing as I thought and hoped he would. I hope one day to converse with him on a level higher than \u201cWould you like a sandwich or scrambled eggs for dinner?\u201d But for now, the fact that he can answer me is wonderful. He rarely screams at home anymore.\nThis year Brian [my then-boyfriend] and I took the boys on their first camping trip. We went to the coast and got rained out, so we just drove until it stopped raining and ended up at a park/campground in Grants Pass. As we were unpacking the car, every minute or less we would hear the roar of some type of vehicle pass nearby. First I thought it might be low-flying planes, then I thought the campground was next to a freeway and that the noise was caused by trucks roaring by. But it was louder than that. The sound was invasive, jolting.\u00a0Each time one would pass, Nigel would nearly go into convulsions of fear and sensory overload. This went on for about ten minutes, and I knew we would have to leave if it didn\u2019t stop soon. I ran down a path through some thick bushes and came out on the banks of the Rogue River. About ten seconds later a speedboat roared by, followed by another. I went back and told Brian what was making the noise, and we figured it would be over soon. Apparently there was a race going on, called Boatnik. Brian thought the boys would like to go down to the river to see the boats, but I thought that would make it worse for them to be so close. I was wrong. As soon as Nigel saw what was making the noise, his fear was gone and he enjoyed watching the boats while covering his ears. He even joined Brian in cheering them on! His capacity to adjust to his disability truly amazes me.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/07/09/seeing-sound/", "title": "Seeing Sound"},

Through his father, he met Nicolas Cage (Raising Arizona and National Treasure get played a lot in our house) and watched him do an impromptu puppet show.\u00a0 Nigel said he was very funny and nice.\nNigel has also been a long-time fan of Robin Williams. In fact, it was Mr. Williams\u2019 performance as Genie in Aladdin that encouraged Nigel\u2019s beginning communication through echolalia. Nigel went on to enjoy other Robin Williams movies, such as Popeye, Flubber, Hook, Toys, Mrs. Doubtfire, Robots, and Night at the Museum, which he has a poster of in his room. His all-time favorite, however, is Jumanji. So when his stepmother came home from work last week and announced that she was working on a film starring Robin Williams, Nigel, eyes wide, said, \u201cTell him I\u2019m his biggest fan.\u201d She did, and Mr. Williams, who has probably heard that a few times before, quipped, \u201cOh, did he take a poll?\u201d and proceeded to personally autograph Nigel\u2019s Jumanji DVD. When his stepmother brought it home for him, his dad said that Nigel\u2019s eyes actually watered, and when I spoke to him about it on the phone today and asked Nigel how he felt to receive the autograph, he immediately said, \u201cEcstatic!\u201d To me, that\u2019s the best part about movies: helping autistic kids to try to communicate, and later, to identify their emotions.

Unless the sequence of events is tied together as a routine, some autistic people can have trouble recalling the steps of an event in the same order. This affects their ability to learn cause/effect and means/end relationships. It also makes it difficult to predict and prepare themselves for coming events. They need a visual reference.\nNigel loves lists and calendars to make sense of the vague concept of time, and he has the cognitive ability to use them. For instance, Nigel is the first one in the household to change the calendar on the morning of the first day of a new month, without fail. He has done this since he was about seven years old. I remember back in December 2001, I had noticed that in the two weeks since December began, Nigel seemed anxious whenever I showed him something on the calendar, even though he was very excited about Christmas coming. I couldn\u2019t figure out what was bothering him about the calendar. The following week I brought home a 2002 calendar and showed it to Nigel. Instantly his face lit up and he said, \u201cNow we have a calendar for January and February 2002!\u201d I realized that he had been anxious because there was nothing for him to visually refer to after December for upcoming events.\nNigel then proceeded to flip through the calendar and write in his shaky but determined hand: \u201cNO SCHOOL\u201d on all the days that there was no school scheduled. I smiled, amused and relieved. Sometimes autism takes a back seat for a minute, and then he\u2019s just a regular kid.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/07/16/time/", "title": "Time"},

But he so enjoyed the rest of each of the movies that he put up with a little ugliness. And now, being a long-time gamer, he\u2019s grown used to the Orcs. He loves the quest storyline and the main characters, especially Gollum, whom he tries to emulate in voice and action (only at home, much to my relief).

{"date": "September 16, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tThose of us who have ever had some type of counseling or psychotherapy know how beneficial it is to be able to talk with a professional about what\u2019s going on in our lives and how we\u2019re handling it (or not). Therapy is also helpful for discussing past events, especially traumatic ones, how they affected us, and how we can work through them. But what if talking is difficult for you? Or impossible? What if you don\u2019t process events and emotions verbally? ASD people encounter just as much, if not more, stress and difficulty while trying to function in an NT world, and many of them have past issues they need to work through as well.\nEnter art therapy for autism. When thoughts and feelings cannot be discussed verbally, art therapy works wonders. It helps to stimulate imagination, regulate sensory issues, encourage hand-eye coordination, and express emotions (including stress). Other long-term benefits include developmental growth, recreation, and self-expression. But there can even be profound benefits from just a single session of art therapy. I witnessed this last night with my autistic son.\nTen months ago, I removed Nigel from the middle school where he had been mainstreamed. He had endured daily bullying, both physical and verbal (and, of course, emotional). This put him in a constant state of anxiety and agitation, making him unable to focus and learn, unable even to function. Soon after removing him from that environment, he became much calmer and was able to focus while being homeschooled. On a weekly basis, even though months have gone by since he attended that school, he mentions how much bullying angers him or mentions something in general about bullies. I\u2019ve always assured him that he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with that anymore. But what I didn\u2019t realize was that Nigel had not yet worked through the trauma of his ordeal. He couldn\u2019t really talk about it, other than his occasional comments, and that wasn\u2019t enough. The memories were still painful for him.\nThen last night Nigel brought out his yearbook. He showed my boyfriend a picture of a girl he liked, and my boyfriend joked about how he used to draw moustaches on yearbook photos. Nigel laughed and went back to his room. He came out an hour or so later with a Calvin and Hobbes book and showed us a series of cartoons about Calvin\u2019s bully, Moe. In one cartoon, Calvin mimics an ape as he quietly walks behind Moe. Nigel couldn\u2019t stop laughing at the cartoon. He went back to his room and came out a few minutes later with his yearbook, showing us how he had used a ballpoint pen to make the face of his worst bully into an ape face. He laughed some more and went back to his room, where he proceeded to laugh non-stop for over an hour. Finally, his laughter subsided, and I went to him to suggest that he get some sleep. He proudly showed me his yearbook. Each page of every grade level had several ape faces drawn over the bullies, both boys and girls, who had tormented him. I fought back tears and didn\u2019t want to count how many faces he had drawn on; there were many. I couldn\u2019t bear to think of how horrible it really had been for my son, day after day. I\u2019ve always known that the decision to homeschool him was the right one, but now I had validation. And it sickened and angered me.\nBut Nigel had found a way to work through his anger. He devised his own art therapy. He scribbled out his anger while eliminating the bullies\u2019 facial features, and then he laughed while adding humiliating details like hairy necks and stupid grins. And he felt better. As I said good night to him, he told me, \u201cNow I can sleep without thinking about the bullies.\u201d\nI\u2019ll try to do the same. \n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.arttherapyandautism.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Its-Magical-World-Calvin-Collection/dp/0836221362/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1221629192&sr=1-2"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/09/16/yearbooks-as-art-therapy/", "title": "Yearbooks As Art Therapy"},

Shasta earlier this summer, was impressed and proud.\nHe was often ahead of me on the 5-mile round-trip trail, which isn\u2019t long compared to the 14 miles for Mt.

But my handy desk dictionary lists another definition for summit: \u201ca meeting among heads of state.\u201d These meetings are often referred to as summit talks, and I just had one a few days ago. Except in our family they\u2019re now called \u201csleeping bag talks.\u201d\nI think of my sons as heads of states. They are the heads of themselves, and so I need to check in with them every now and then, to regroup, and to just talk. I used to have lofty ideas of holding monthly \u201cfamily meetings\u201d about what was going on in our lives, what we need to work on, what we\u2019d like to do, etc. Of course, nothing that structured could actually materialize. If I were to walk into their rooms on a Sunday afternoon (which my delusional self always thought would be a good time for a talk) and say, \u201cHey, guys, let\u2019s have a family meeting!\u201d they would be all, Are you serious? That\u2019s so Brady Bunch, Mom. No, they\u2019d be much too busy building Lego/playing Halo/Googling Everything. And so, I have to sneak in my family summit talks. I\u2019ve learned to strategize.\nTake our recent camping trip, for example. What else do you do in an 8 x 9 tent with your sons on either side of you\u00a0and one of them\u00a0can\u2019t sleep because you forgot to give him his medication until late in the afternoon and it\u2019s keeping him up? That\u2019s right, you talk. When autistic/ND kids want to talk, you go with it. Carpe diem.\nI can\u2019t remember when I\u2019ve had more fun talking with my boys! Nigel started off with a discussion about time travel, influenced by having watched Back to the Future for probably the fifty-eighth time. But, unlike his usual one-sided talk about how he was going to make his own time machine and what he would do with it, he wanted to converse. He asked both Aidan and me what we would do if we had a time machine. After talking about famous people we wanted to meet (Abraham Lincoln and Charles Dickens), and then talking about all the presidents who were assassinated and possible reasons why, I came up with the suggestion of going back a hundred years and buying stock in Coca Cola.\u00a0 The boys yelled \u201cGenius!\u201d and high-fived me in the dark. Then we talked about what we would do with the money. I must admit that, aside from saying we\u2019d use some of the money to help out friends and family, we\u2019re not the most altruistic bunch. Aidan wanted to start his own company (now it was my turn to high-five him), Nigel wanted a room full of Lego (which, in my opinion, he already has), and I wanted to travel more and be able to take the boys with me.\nAnd after a while, Aidan fell asleep, and then Nigel turned to me, as if he had been waiting, and asked, \u201cWhen did you first see signs that I had autism?\u201d And I told him that when he was about two and a half I realized that he wasn\u2019t trying to talk or interact, and that by the time he was three, after some evaluations by doctors and therapists, it was determined that he had autism. I couldn\u2019t discuss \u2013 yet \u2013 the complexities of his sensory issues, the way he screamed and writhed on the floor of grocery stores and restaurants, not because he was having a tantrum, but because someone had turned on an electric coffee grinder. I couldn\u2019t tell him \u2013 yet \u2013 about how he lined up his toy cars along the back of the couch and laid his head to one side and stared at them while he sucked his fingers instead of driving them around on the floor making engine noises. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ready to hear about all that yet. But I knew that he could understand the not-talking part. As soon as I mentioned it, he said, \u201cProbably I was just taking my time.\u201d\nAnd since it was dark, I did not wipe away the tears streaming down the sides of my head. I said, \u201cYes, Nigel, I\u2019m sure you were. And I\u2019m glad that you learned to talk. But if you didn\u2019t, that would be okay, too.\u201d\nAnd then he said, \u201cMom? With that money we get from time traveling, how about if we give some of it to other kids who have autism so they can have speech therapy to learn to talk?\u201d\nI hugged him and told him we could certainly do that.\nNext time we go camping, I better bring a whole box of tissues.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Thielsen", "http://www.nps.gov/crla/index.htm"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/08/29/sleeping-bag-talks/", "title": "Sleeping Bag Talks"},

I ran into an acquaintance of mine from a couple of years ago, and we started talking about our sons, since we remembered that we both have sons of approximately the same age. It turns out that his son and Nigel were born on the exact same day, same year, same hospital, within two hours and fifty minutes of each other. Bizarre. I thought, aside from the autism, they must be a lot alike.\nAnd that got me thinking. Out of the seven or so babies born in that place at that time, we were visited by the Autism Fairy. The luck of the draw. But I don\u2019t think that in a Why us? sort of way. There are times, like when I was at work and the school would call me about a behavioral problem, and when I was at the movie theater and the manager and Nigel came to me in the middle of the movie, that I think Why me? at that moment, because I am stressed.

{"date": "June 26, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tIt can be extremely difficult to regulate your autistic child\u2019s diet. I know that song and dance all too well. But it is something we parents must attempt. Diet \u2013 what we put into our bodies \u2013 affects our health even more than most of us realize, and this is certainly true for autistic individuals, as evidenced by the success of the GF/CF diet. But since we did not have a successful experience with that, I have modified Nigel\u2019s diet over the years to one that seems to work the best for him. Following are seven suggestions for diet modification:\n1) Try the GF/CF diet. It might benefit your child. Be sure to maintain consistency with it for several weeks to accurately gauge its effectiveness.\n2) Limit sweeteners, especially artificial ones. Nigel is okay with the occasional bit of natural sugar that crosses his path, even a little corn syrup now and then, but he absolutely cannot have any artificial sweeteners. He becomes completely agitated and unmanageable, reverts to echolalia, and general chaos ensues. That means mainstream sodas (Coke, Pepsi, etc.) are out, but once in a while I allow him to have some even though I regret it later. He is particularly sensitive to Aspartame, which I\u2019ve read many bad things about on the internet.\n3) Limit other chemicals: artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. I\u2019ve read that the Red No.-whatever colors are the worst, but the rest can\u2019t be far behind. We frequent the natural foods section of various grocery stores and buy all of our cereals and snacks there. No Trix or rainbow-colored goldfish crackers!\n4) Try organic food. Yes, there\u2019s been a lot of debate about if it\u2019s worth the extra cost or if the money\u2019s all in the organic labeling. That may be true in some cases, but know this: In the past two years since I started buying organic food, and not everything \u2013 just about one-third of the food we consume is organic \u2013 I have only been sick once and it was extremely mild. Both of my sons have only been sick twice. Twice, in two whole years! And those were also mild illnesses. For kids, that\u2019s pretty amazing. I am sold on organic foods no matter what I read or what anyone says. They are so much better for your health. They automatically exclude artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives. And pesticides! And they taste far better, too.\u00a0 I think I\u2019ll write a whole post about organic food.\n5) Push fruit. Fruit aids the digestive system and is full of vitamins. Of course, consuming vegetables is just as important, but if your child balks at most vegetables (like mine), you may have better luck with fruit since it is sweeter.\n6) Encourage water consumption. This will be very difficult if your child acts like water is poison. My younger son used to fall into that category. I was able to get him to drink more water by bargaining with him with what he wanted: If you drink half a glass of water, then you can have a glass of lemonade. \n7) Limit meat consumption. Meat is more difficult to digest, so I cook with smaller amounts and on fewer days of the week. You don\u2019t have to cut something out completely to see the benefits of scaling back.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/06/26/7-dietary-changes-to-try/", "title": "7 Dietary Changes to Try"},

He could never be accused of \u201cB.S-ing\u201d about something he did not know, and I doubt that will ever change.\nBut when I haven\u2019t seen him for weeks, I want to hear more about how he\u2019s been, what he\u2019s been doing. And those are often difficult topics for him to discuss, especially if a TV is distracting him. I know this, it has always been this way, and so I am patient.\nMe: So what did you do over the weekend?\nNigel: [silence]\nMe: Did you go to the beach?\nNigel: [silence]\nMe: Nigel? Did you go to the beach over the weekend?\nNigel: Yes.\nMe: Which beach did you go to?\nNigel: I don\u2019t know.\nMe: Did you visit anyone?\nNigel: [silence]\nMe: Nigel?\nNigel: [silence]\nMe: Nigel, is the TV on?\nNigel: Yes.\nMe: What are you watching?\nNigel: [silence]\nMe: What are you watching on TV?\nNigel: The Lost Pyramid.\nMe: Is it on the History Channel or Discovery?\nNigel: [silence]\nMe: Is it on the History Channel or Discovery?\nNigel: History.\nMe: Okay, well, I love you.\nNigel: I love you, too, bye.\nRelieved, I\u2019m sure, he hangs up. He knows I love you is the last thing we say on the phone. And I am always so glad I can hear him say it.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/06/25/conversations-with-nigel/", "title": "Conversations With Nigel"},
{"date": "June 29, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tOver the weekend, I did some looking around online at autism sites written by \u201cauties.\u201d (I\u2019m still getting used to that word, which is why I put it in quotations. It took me eight years to come to terms with using the word \u201cautistic,\u201d so \u201cautie\u201d will sound different to me for a while.) I was sad to see that many of them are quite bitter. I can\u2019t say that I blame them, because with the harassment and ignorance that Nigel has dealt with, I\u2019m sure there are plenty of other auties who have experienced the same treatment. And as they head into adulthood, that\u2019s a lot of accumulated years of negative exchanges. \u00a0\u00a0\nI found a bumper sticker that says: \u201cCure Neurotypicals now!\u201d And in smaller print below: \u201cOffended? Good. Now you know how we feel.\u201d Meant to be funny, I presume, with an ounce (at least) of seriousness. But some of the web sites I viewed over the weekend seemed just plain angry. I want to tell the authors something, with all my heart.\n\u00a0I\u2019m sorry for how you\u2019ve been treated. You have every right to be angry. But holding on to that anger will only make you feel worse. Remaining angry will not alleviate the anger. Remaining angry will not punish the people who hurt you. Remaining angry will only hurt you. Please, for your emotional well-being, channel your anger into something positive, like creating an online support group for others who have experienced the same thing. You will know you are not alone, and you\u2019ll feel at least a little better.\nNigel gets angry about bullies. Most likely, as he gets older he will experience more bullying and more ignorance. I don\u2019t like thinking about what he has gone through, what he will continue to face, how things will be for him in high school, possibly college, a future workplace, and the general community. I hope that I\u2019ve given him a strong enough base of love and self-worth that he can successfully let go of his anger and not allow it to consume him.\nI don\u2019t want Nigel to feel bitter when he\u2019s an adult. I want him to feel cherished, appreciated for who he is, and important. I want him to feel loved.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://bumperstickers.cafepress.com/item/cure-neurotypicals/90215370"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/06/29/bitterness/", "title": "Bitterness"},
{"date": "July 2, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tI mentioned in a recent post how eating organic food has made a big difference in our family\u2019s health, and I wanted to go into more detail about that. In the past two years, I have had only one mild illness, over in two days, and the boys have each had only two mild illnesses. I used to have spring allergies so bad that I would need to be on Claritin-D for two months straight. Not since I started eating organic food. \u00a0My nose still gets a little itchy and I sneeze a bit, but at least I can breathe at night. \u00a0I have not experienced any major congestion in two years.\nThe great thing about organic food is that you don\u2019t have to buy everything organic to notice the benefits. All you have to do to get started is to look at what you consume every day and choose one of those items and buy it organic. For me, I almost always have cold cereal and milk for breakfast. So do my sons. We started drinking organic milk and noticed the difference right away. For one thing, it tastes so much better than non-organic, somehow fresher and more flavorful. I switched my cereal to an organic brand, and Nigel\u2019s also. (Aidan is addicted to his Crispix. He\u2019s an even pickier eater than Nigel.)\nNext I looked at what else we eat a lot of in our house: fruit. Both boys eat apples every day, so I started buying organic apples. Yes, they are more expensive, but our health is worth it. And neither of the boys got sick at all until almost a year later, when the next school year started. A nasty flu was going around, but they were only down for two days. And I didn\u2019t get sick at all.\nI started buying more organic fruit, yogurt, eggs, and tried some organic meat. Words can\u2019t accurately describe how much better it all tastes. I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019ll never go back to non-organic. On the contrary \u2013 I would say that at this point the percentage of my diet that is organic is probably only half, or less than half. I\u2019m not the type of guest at a potluck who passes up a great-looking dish because it\u2019s non-organic. And on the rare occasions I eat out, I don\u2019t ask if anything\u2019s organic. Eating organic isn\u2019t like being a vegetarian or vegan \u2013 it\u2019s not all or nothing, unless you want it to be. Another great thing about organic food is that it cuts out all the chemicals \u2013 the artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives present in most non-organic food that can be so detrimental to the functioning of an autistic person, as I mentioned in my previous post.\nTry switching to organic even for just one or two items that you eat on a regular basis. It\u2019s definitely worth the effort. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/07/02/the-organic-difference/", "title": "The Organic Difference"},
{"date": "July 1, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tLast week a friend of mine found a lost dog, a little Yorkie, running around in a street in our town, and she picked him up so he wouldn\u2019t get hit. There was no owner information on his tag, so she called the animal shelter, but no one had reported him yet. \u00a0She then proceeded to go door-to-door in that neighborhood trying to find the owner and finally did. The Yorkie, Sam, belonged to two older ladies, sisters living together. They were ecstatic to have him back and invited my friend in for tea.\nThe younger-looking sister was tall and thin and began telling my friend all sorts of wonderful stories about Sam, going off on tangents about their family members, places they\u2019d traveled, and other dogs they\u2019d owned. The older-looking sister, who was shorter and appeared to have osteoporosis, would periodically roll her eyes and say with urgency, \u201cFocus, Martha, focus!\u201d\nI laughed as my friend told the story, envisioning the exchange. It reminded me of all the times, especially in the past few months of homeschooling, when I had to redirect Nigel by telling him to focus on what we were doing. I often have to remind myself to focus with all the different projects and distractions I have going on. Focusing is how we achieve our goals in the face of daily life. It\u2019s also how to keep things short and sweet when a stranger returns a lost pet. \u201cFocus, Martha, focus!\u201d I had to write that on a Post-it note and stick it on my monitor.

But ultimately, I want my son to be proud of himself and all that he has accomplished: wanting to communicate, learning to talk, which was so difficult for him, figuring out how to filter his sensory issues (equally difficult), learning about all the social expectations of this NT world and dealing with its ignorance. But even if he hadn\u2019t done all of that, I would still want him to be proud of his unique, amazing self.

{"date": "July 3, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nI couldn\u2019t wait to reread this book to write the review. That\u2019s how much I love it.\nAuthor Mark Haddon has created, in my view, a realistic fictional autistic teen with an amazing way of describing the life and people that surround him. But what I love most about the book is how much the main character, 15-year-old Christopher, reminds me of my son Nigel (aside from the fact that Christopher is incredibly good at math, and Nigel is at the opposite end of that spectrum). I love experiencing Christopher\u2019s usually detached observation, his mannerisms that are so close to home for me. I could identify with the intense love coupled with the equally intense frustration that his father feels raising him alone. When I read Christopher\u2019s thought processes (portrayed so well by Haddon), I recognize what Nigel has been able to convey to me about his own.\nI love reading about Christopher\u2019s determination to do things himself, which reminds me so much of my son. Christopher\u2019s love of animals is touching and also familiar, as are his attempts to understand the complexities of emotions and his need to always give the exact minute when telling time. He tries hard to manage his sensory issues and asks people for help when he needs it. He is persistent about the things that are important to him, like taking a high-level math test, and being a detective.\nI won\u2019t say anything about the plot of the book because it is so captivating; the only way to appreciate it is to read it and experience it yourself. And besides, it is a mystery. I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil it. Christopher points out at the beginning, \u201cThis is a murder mystery novel,\u201d and in trying to solve it, he discovers another one that changes everything. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is tender, moving, and beautifully written.

{"date": "May 22, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tRecently I wrote about experiencing setbacks with Nigel\u2019s development and how it gets me down. It seems like I\u2019ll never get a break. But what I didn\u2019t remember is that usually when setbacks occur, soon afterward something happens that\u2019s positive, a step in the right direction. And that\u2019s exactly what happened today.\nThe school subject that Nigel has the most trouble with is math. Yes, math. Is that \u201canti-autistic?\u201d I seem to read so much about how math appeals to autistic\u00a0people because of the formulas, the predictability of working with numbers, and I don\u2019t know why else because I\u2019ve never liked math, so trying to come up with reasons to like it is a stretch for me. But I\u2019ve always done okay with it, learned the basics, use them regularly, and identify the importance of mathematical knowledge as I\u2019m trying to teach Nigel. But he has so much trouble with it (and no interest \u2013 must be genetic), that even when we go over the same problems and I walk him through so many and do them with him, he still doesn\u2019t get it. After working on multiplying fractions for close to two weeks with no hope of him retaining any of it, I wasn\u2019t sure what to do.\nThen I remembered: break it down into written steps. That\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve been\u00a0able to get him to\u00a0pick up\u00a0his room. That\u2019s how some of his classroom teachers got him to work on activities and follow directions. And that\u2019s how he was able to just get through the day when he was younger: having a schedule broken down into steps. I decided to break down the steps of what he was having the most trouble with \u2013 changing improper fractions into mixed numbers. Here is what I wrote for him:\nSteps to convert improper fractions to mixed numbers:\n1) Divide the numerator (# on top) by the denominator (# on bottom)\n2) Write down the whole #\n3) Multiply the whole # by the denominator\n4) Subtract that # from the numerator\n5) Answer is the new numerator for mixed #, placed over same denominator\nHe did the next problem completely unassisted in less than two minutes. I have to remember to break things down into written steps more often. Why do I forget? It should be common sense to me by now! Maybe I\u2019ll remember better now, since I\u2019ve written about it here. I think that\u2019s something that works for both of us.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/05/22/comes-the-dawn/", "title": "Comes the Dawn"},
{"date": "May 24, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tThose who live or work with autistic individuals know that transitions can be difficult. There are the big transitions, like starting a different school, moving to a new house, dealing with major schedule changes due to divorce, etc., or some other big change. They are the mountains that we sometimes have to climb. And they often feel insurmountable.\nBut what about the little transitions? The daily hurdles that for some autistic people cause such an upheaval? The minor changes that sometimes come up due to a cancellation? Even the regular transitions between daily activities can be difficult to navigate. A small part of me understands because of the way I feel about bathing and swimming. I love to be in the water, but I\u2019d rather not experience the transitions involved in getting in and getting out. I\u2019m cold when I first get in the shower, cold when I get out, and then I have to deal with wet hair and skin. My own little sensory issue? Probably.\u00a0Of course\u00a0after I\u2019ve dried off and gotten dressed, I always love feeling clean and relaxed. But I take that feeling of not liking the transition and I apply that to how I deal with Nigel when he\u2019s having trouble with a small transition.\u00a0A little empathy goes a long way.\nWhen he attended the middle school, he had trouble with transitioning from class to class. It wasn\u2019t because he would forget where to go. It was because the halls were noisy and kids would come up to him and harass him and he\u2019d get to his next class angry and the teacher would tell him to sit down and that only added to his negative frame of mind. It wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t want to change classes. He just had trouble with the transition. And the school wasn\u2019t willing to let him leave class three minutes early to avoid that. Yet another reason why I decided to homeschool him.\nNow that he\u2019s home, he no longer has difficulty transitioning to different school subjects. But we still experience some trouble with transitioning between activities, especially if the new activity takes him away from Lego building, YouTube surfing, or movie watching. You would think that a teenage boy who eats non-stop would be happy to hear the phrase \u201cDinner\u2019s ready!\u201d and come running. Not so. His typical response is \u201cThat fast?!\u201d in a disappointed tone. I have tried modeling more appropriate responses for him, such as \u201cThanks, Mom\u201d or even \u201cIn a minute,\u201d but it has become such a habit for him to say \u201cThat fast?!\u201d that I can\u2019t seem to break him of it.\nBut I often forget the all-important warnings. \u201cDinner is in 15 minutes,\u201d and then \u201cDinner is in 5 minutes\u201d to ease him into it. It\u2019s hard to remember all the enabling things you have to do as a parent of a child with a disability, just so that things run smoothly. Even when you do them for so many years, you can sometimes forget. And I\u00a0try\u00a0not\u00a0to think about\u00a0the fact that he probably says \u201cThat fast?!\u201d when he\u2019s visiting a friend\u2019s house and the friend\u2019s parent says \u201cDinner\u2019s\u00a0ready!\u201d Maybe next time he goes to a friend\u2019s house, I\u2019ll email the\u00a0parent the link to this post. And they can read about how to manage their child\u2019s high-maintenance, sometimes inappropriate friend! Or I\u2019ll just apologize in advance for his apparent rudeness.\u00a0\nI used to try to enforce a rule at the dinner table: no toys allowed after age 6. \u201cOnly little kids need toys at the table,\u201d I\u2019d say. But Nigel always had to bring a piece of whatever occupied him before dinner to the table: an action figure, a Lego creation, a stuffed animal, a magazine. It seemed to be the only way he could transition. And whenever we left the house, he did the same thing. He would keep\u00a0a little something from home in his pocket and hold it periodically. Like his own way of saying, You can take it with you. So I finally realized, okay, this is what he needs. And I changed the no-toys-at-the-dinner-table rule to \u201cNo toys bigger than an apple at the dinner table,\u201d and everyone\u2019s a lot happier.\nI think the bottom line is figuring out how to work with the little transitions. The big ones are a different story, but the little ones can be more manageable provided that you\u2019re willing to act like an enabler. Let them bring something in the car or to the dinner table. Give notice when it\u2019s nearing time for a change of activity, even dinner. Yeah, I wish I didn\u2019t have to do that with a teenager. But when the goal is to make a transition smoother, and\u00a0I find a way to do that, I\u2019m just going to go with it and not worry about how much of an enabler that makes me.\u00a0\u00a0The day will come when we\u2019ll have to transition out of that mode, and I\u2019ll deal with it then. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll\u00a0come up with\u00a0something that works.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/05/24/little-transitions/", "title": "Little Transitions"},
{"date": "September 1, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tI\u2019ve been seeing this meme going around the blogosphere for a bit, and every time I see it I think about what I might list as my quirks. And now I\u2019ve been tagged with it (by Bonnie at Autism Family Adventures), so I\u2019ve got to censor narrow down my quirks to six. Herewith, I admit to the following as unsheepishly as possible:\n\nI am obsessed with peeling sunburns. You take your life in your hands if you walk past me and I happen to notice skin flaking off your shoulders. My sons run from me. And I don\u2019t just peel skin off of other people; I enjoy peeling my own sunburns even more. But since I do wear sunscreen daily, my opportunities for self-peeling are limited.\nI love the different textures of my hair. I love when I run my fingers through it and discover one that\u2019s coarse and wiry hidden among the rest of the straight hair. I love how it feels on my fingers.\nEveryone has their own scent (and not the sprayed-on kind). When I am in close proximity to people I know well, I discreetly inhale their scent. With my kids I am more direct; I walk right up behind them and smell the tops of their heads. (If this is starting to sound like I\u2019m a little \u201catypical,\u201d I would wholeheartedly agree with that assessment.)\nI am freakishly good at word searches. I can find them diagonally/backwards and any other way. If a word is in a word search, I will find it, and usually quickly. When Aidan brings one home from school, I have to restrain myself not to do it for him.\nI only sleep on my left side, although this is more of a forced quirk, since it\u2019s because of a snowboarding injury to my right shoulder a couple of years ago. No more jumps for me!\nI have not worn a watch in twenty years. Instead, every day for twenty years I have worn a silver bracelet that my grandmother gave to me. If that bracelet could talk, this list of quirks would have no end.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s time to pass the fun. The rules of this meme are as follows:\n1. Link the person who tagged you.\n2. Mention the rules on your blog.\n3. Tell about 6 unspectacular quirks you possess.\n4. Tag 6 following bloggers by linking them.\n5. Leave a comment on each of the tagged blogger\u2019s blogs letting them know they\u2019ve been tagged.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: when you play tag, you only have to tag one person. So I am going to bend the rules and only tag one other blogger whose quirks I\u2019m dying to know . . . Osh at The House That Osh Built!

Mrs. Lu, who in my memory did not appear to have any teacher aids or assistants, taught this class of approximately twelve children with various disabilities. That was \u201cmainstreaming\u201d in the 1970s. The kids in her class (ages 6 to 12 or so) had their own lunch table in the cafeteria; no one from another class dared to sit there for fear of being ridiculed by the rest of the school. The Room 2 kids all played together at recess.

It was taboo to even talk to \u201cthem.\u201d\nThe rest of us were told that they were \u201cmentally retarded.\u201d That was all. Autism was not mentioned, nor Down\u2019s Syndrome. No one explained what \u201cretarded\u201d really meant, and that not all of those children were retarded. No one tried to teach the rest of us to integrate them, to accept them, to think of them as kids. No\u00a0teacher suggested that they had feelings like the rest of us. So we recoiled from them. I\u00a0didn\u2019t feel right about it, but at age\u00a0eight I didn\u2019t have the strength to stand up to other kids and say, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with them! They want to have friends too!\u201d I certainly couldn\u2019t bring myself to taunt them with shouts of \u201cRetard!\u201d like many of my classmates did, but neither could I bring myself to stop the taunting. I just walked on by, pretending it didn\u2019t concern me.\nAnd now I have a child with autism. I remember when he was seven, hearing someone shout \u201cRetard!\u201d at him in my own front yard. I dashed out the front door and yelled at the boy who said it, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare call my son that! You need to leave now!\u201d I wish I could have slapped that boy across the face. He must have come over because he wanted to use Nigel\u2019s wagon. Or else he was just bored. I didn\u2019t know what to make of it. Too many thoughts rushed through my mind. I wondered how many times Nigel had been called \u201cretard\u201d that I hadn\u2019t heard, like at school.\nRoom 2 still stands out in my memory. I wonder about the school district\u2019s protocol back then. Why the segregation? Was it fear? Laziness? I am glad that their ideas about students with disabilities have changed, but they have much farther to go for mainstreaming to be successful. Teach acceptance. Teach empathy. Is that so hard? Kids these days are taught about internet safety, recycling, birth control,\u00a0and plenty of other non-academic subjects. Surely teaching them how to have respect for others, especially those who have disabilities, is at least as important. If we\u2019re going to have more and more autistic kids mainstreamed into the public school system, they need to have the \u201cfree and appropriate education\u201d that has been promised to them. Being excluded and called a retard is in no way appropriate. It\u2019s time to retire the Room 2 mentality and make some real progress.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/05/27/room-2/", "title": "Room 2"},

Yes, early on that boy was probably skeptical about Santa.\nI had been on the couch breast-feeding four-month-old Aidan, and out of the corner of my eye I saw Nigel coming out of my room with an odd look on his face. I somehow knew that he had found the toys in the closet. I stood up with Aidan still on my breast (I got very good at that) and walked down the hall to where Nigel was standing. He walked back into my room and stood in front of the now-open closet and said in a flat but certain voice, \u201cToys.\u201d Much to my surprise, not only had he had spoken (which he rarely did then), but he had also not taken any of the toys out. They were still neatly stacked in the closet where I had put them.\n\u201cYes, those are toys,\u201d I said. \u201cBut those toys are for Christmas, and if you open them now, then you won\u2019t have any toys for Christmas.\u201d It was a shot in the dark. I was expecting a full-blown tantrum, mostly because I figured of course the two-year-old wants the toys! But also because I figured there would be no way that he could comprehend what I had said to him.\nAfter I explained about the toys, I closed the closet door, and much to my shock, he just quietly followed me out of the room. I asked him if he would like to watch a Disney video, and he got on the couch with the utmost compliance. It was as if he understood what I had told him about the toys and accepted it! I was floored!\nToys are rather magical things. They can prompt an autistic two-year-old to talk, and they can motivate his behavior in anticipation of receiving them. For years, they also served as therapy objects, teaching him how to play, how to engage in social behavior, and eventually encouraging spontaneous speech.\nI wrote this post today because I had noticed several incoming searches for toys for autistic teens. I think the rule of thumb with what would be appropriate is along the same lines as my advice for books for autistic teens: it depends on their cognitive level and individual interests. The difference with selecting toys is that it also depends on their level of emotional maturity. Nigel, for instance, is fairly high cognitively, however, his emotional maturity is a few years behind his peers. I think this is why, going into eighth grade, he still loves his stuffed animals and toys from his favorite movies (Jurassic Park dinosaurs and Thomas the Tank Engine). \u00a0He is really not into video games, but he\u2019s always had an interest in science, so he has a microscope, telescope, chemistry set, and volcano model. He is also entertained by robots and remote controlled cars. And Lego. That has to be his all-time favorite toy. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever outgrow it! He hasn\u2019t outgrown looking in closets for toys, either.

The longest time of not seeing one another (seven weeks, two days) is over! \u00a0And now, Nigel and I stand eye to eye, nose to nose. Aidan, with his short hair and deep tan, I hardly recognize. But I know their scents, and their embraces. \u00a0It\u2019s so good to have them home.\nThis was their seventh summer in LA with their dad. In previous years, they have also visited him for one- or two-week increments at Christmas or Spring Break. Usually I drive five and a half hours to a junction just north of Stockton, California, which is near the half-way point between my house and their dad\u2019s house. Their dad meets us there for lunch, and then we transfer suitcases and bags, sometimes bikes and skates, into the other car. And then we transfer kids. I call it the 700-Mile Kid Swap. Then I turn around and drive five and a half hours back home. It\u2019s a hell of a thing to do six times a year.\nSo my son\u2019s young lives have been filled with many good-byes and as many reunions. It is a different way to grow up from what I experienced; my parents remained married throughout my childhood. I had friends whose parents were divorced, but in southern California, the other parent was never more than an hour\u2019s drive away, not eleven hours. I often wonder about the emotional long-term effects of this arrangement on my kids. I know it\u2019s hard on me, and I\u2019m an adult. Aidan once said to me, when he was seven, \u201cI feel like I have two lives.\u201d Kids shouldn\u2019t have to feel that way.\nBut it\u2019s important that they maintain a good relationship with their father, and I think in the long run they\u2019ll realize that we did the best we could to achieve that, given the circumstances. The 700-Mile Kid Swap has taught them flexibility and patience, two skills that are invaluable for autistic kids, and difficult to learn. They\u2019ve had many great experiences in LA that have enriched their lives, and they\u2019ve learned to appreciate and adapt to a different environment. It\u2019s not the typical joint custody arrangement, but for the most part, it\u2019s working.\nAs for me, I\u2019m just glad they\u2019re back.

I\u2019m glad that his father was able to do it again with him. It allows them to have some one-on-one time, and now Aidan can have some one-on-one time with me.\nOne-on-one can be an elusive (my euphemism for nearly impossible) concept for single parents, especially any whose other parent lives seven hundred miles away. But one-on-one time with parents is so important for kids. It makes them feel like a priority when their parents have carved out time for them, and it teaches them to do the same for people in their lives as they get older. In special needs families, the typically-developing children often feel like they are fending for themselves because their parents need to spend so much time tending to the needs of their sibling, going to therapy appointments, doing damage control. Often, the NT siblings take on some of the damage control themselves, or they take on more responsibility around the house. Aidan has on several occasions told me that he feels like the older brother, even though he\u2019s younger. He\u2019s had to explain his brother\u2019s behavior many times to peers, and has done so with patience and respect. I have extolled his virtues and those of other siblings in a previous post, and I will continue to.\nSo this week is Aidan\u2019s week. We are watching all six of the Star Wars movies, one each night, and today I rented a video game for him that he had a lot of fun with (Lego Indiana Jones). We bought a pint of raspberry sorbet for dessert, and we made plans to go river rafting on Saturday. As we sat on the couch tonight watching our movie (we\u2019re on Episode 2), he leaned up against me and began gently, methodically scrunching handfuls of my hair in his palm. He has done this for years, I think as a bonding ritual that appeals to his tactile sensitivity. After a minute of doing so, he said, \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be able to squeeze your hair again, Mom.\u201d I told him I\u2019m glad he can do it again too.

We learn to anticipate, listen to our intuition, and be aware. But we also have to go deep within ourselves to summon our strength and find our courage.

The first few years I was fighting the autism itself, grasping at therapies and\u00a0treatments when there wasn\u2019t much out there, as far as resources and current information. And, in my state of shock, I was referred to an excellent agency called Child Development Services. They had current information. They helped my son, those speech therapists, occupational therapists, behavior consultants, and autism specialists. \u00a0In my mind we were fighting the autism. I wanted things to get back to normal.\nThen I realized I had to find a new normal. I realized that my son wasn\u2019t going to \u201cgrow out of it.\u201d He would progress, he would slowly, painstakingly learn to talk, he would gradually learn to filter the sensory input that often caused him to scream and writhe in public. And my fight changed a bit. I tried to mainstream my son, and I came to feel like I was fighting the school district. He had an educational assistant (two, sometimes); we had weekly meetings during which his teacher actually rolled her eyes when discussing my son; I came to the school and found him running around the halls aimlessly. This was not a new normal that I could live with, so we switched schools. Again.\nNow I\u2019ve accepted that\u00a0the fight\u00a0will continue indefinitely, but it continues to change. Now that I\u2019m homeschooling, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m fighting the school district, although I should have. In the space of his last six weeks there, they suspended my autistic son twice, for behavior that he could not control. Part of me wishes I had taken them to court, but I didn\u2019t have the time or the energy, really. And my younger son had to still be enrolled in that district, to stay with his friends. I had to consider his needs as well.\nWe are all still fighting. We all have our own crosses to bear. I once read or heard an analogy that if all the people in the world were lined up next to each other, and we could put all our problems in a suitcase and\u00a0set it in front of us and then trade suitcases with someone else, in the end we would pick up our own suitcase and carry on with that. Some of us are fighting the autism, some of us are fighting the school district, and some of us are fighting the ignorant public, trying to find a place in it for our kids. A place of acceptance and a place of dignity.\nSo here\u2019s to all of us who pick up our own damn suitcase every day and continue on. We may not have enlisted in this army, but we believe in the cause, and we\u2019ll keep fighting.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/08/09/army-of-advocates/", "title": "Army of Advocates"},

I suppose I should consider myself lucky that he wasn\u2019t coerced into doing anything illegal, but after what happened last year, I could see that things could easily get to that point.\nAs I\u00a0described in yesterday\u2019s post, the hallway torment resumed, and now it included more kids, even girls. They knew better than to try anything in class, since the teachers were now aware of what had been going on, but it was open season in the hallways. Nigel became so anxious in class just anticipating being harassed after class that he couldn\u2019t focus and would become disruptive and get in trouble. I didn\u2019t know what to do for him, so I thought I\u2019d discuss options with his teachers and the special education coordinator at his upcoming IEP.\nIt was there that I learned of something else that made my blood boil, something I had been completely in the dark about. Apparently Nigel\u2019s teachers in the classes he had after lunch had been wondering why he would come in the classroom hot, sweaty, and complaining of being tired. It was spring, but not yet hot. He would lay his head on his desk and not be able to get any work done, or refused to do any, claiming that he was \u201ctoo tired.\u201d Not one teacher had contacted me to discuss this. Finally, after a few weeks, one of the aids witnessed him running laps around the field at lunch. When asked why, he said, \u201cMy friends told me to do it. I have to prove to them that I\u2019m strong enough.\u201d These \u201cfriends\u201d turned out to be a group of kids who would tell Nigel to run laps or perform various tricks and then laugh at his expense. But what was even worse was that when the adults at the meeting told me about it, they were laughing. They were jovial, as if my son was there for everyone\u2019s amusement. As if it was funny that Nigel wanted to do these things. When they saw my face and realized that I did not find it to be the least bit humorous, they immediately became serious and assured me that they explained to Nigel that he doesn\u2019t have to run laps and do tricks just because the kids told him to. That\u2019s when I lowered my voice and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what is upsetting to me. Those kids need to be told that it\u2019s NOT okay to get the autistic kid to do something and then laugh about it. They\u2019re taking advantage of someone with a disability.\u201d Why do educators only focus on \u201cfixing\u201d the autistic kids? Yes, the autistic kids need to work on inappropriate behavior. But so do a lot of the NT kids. What they were doing to Nigel was highly inappropriate, to say the least.\nThat\u2019s when I remembered stories about autistic kids who\u2019d had drugs or weapons planted on them by \u201cfriends\u201d just to get them in trouble. I talked to Nigel that night, tried to gently explain to him that real friends don\u2019t tell you to do anything. \u201cBut I wanted to do it. It\u2019s okay because I\u2019m strong enough.\u201d \u201cI know you\u2019re strong enough. You\u2019re stronger than anyone realizes. But if someone wants to be your friend, it will be because they like you for who you are, not because you can run laps or do tricks.\u201d I saw the realization dawn on his trusting face. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said quietly.

And so he was nearly obsessed with the birds\u2019 nest that was at the Scout camp. There were baby birds in it, up in a tree, and all of the Scout groups took turns going to observe the nest. Scouts and adult leaders alike enjoyed watching the baby birds and their parents.\u00a0 Nigel, more excited than most, decided that he wanted to hold one of the babies.\nWell, I\u2019m sure you can see where this is going. In his attempt to retrieve the nest, it fell to the ground. Afraid that he would get in trouble, he left the scene. Everyone at camp soon discovered that the nest had been knocked down and the babies had died, and they all wondered who was responsible. Nigel\u2019s dad had a feeling, so he privately asked Nigel if he had done it. Nigel, visibly upset, admitted his terrible mistake.\nIt pains me to think of my poor son in such turmoil, berating himself for not thinking about the consequences of his actions, feeling such guilt and remorse that he caused himself to projectile vomit because of his nerves. He has made mistakes of this magnitude before, and after dealing with the consequences, I\u2019ve always assured him that making mistakes is part of growing up, that we all do it, autistic or not. He often blames his neurological difference, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s because of the A word. I have a defective brain.\u201d Telling him that different does not mean defective doesn\u2019t seem to help much.\u00a0 I hate that \u201cthe A word\u201d causes him to devalue himself.\nAnd so we get through the day \u2013 the week \u2013 with another \u201clearning experience\u201d under our collective belts. \u00a0Some weeks there\u2019s just more to learn, I guess.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/08/11/calamity-at-scout-camp/", "title": "Calamity at Scout Camp"},
{"date": "June 5, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tIt was seventh grade that really kicked our collective butts. The proverbial straw that broke my camel\u2019s back. It started off with Nigel getting punched in the face on the third day of school and only got worse from there.\nIt was during lunch when three boys verbally ganged up on him, riling him up, probably trying to make him lash out so that he would get in trouble. He was getting very agitated, verbally defending himself, and stepped in really close to the lead boy to try to make his point. Apparently Nigel \u201ctouched\u201d the other boy on the arm. That made it okay for the boy to sock Nigel\u2019s cheekbone, because Nigel had \u201ctouched\u201d him. The other boy was exempt from reproof. The school\u2019s dean called to tell me what had happened, adding in a condescending voice that he explained to Nigel that he shouldn\u2019t \u201ctouch\u201d anyone. He might as well have said that Nigel asked for it. I was livid. Let\u2019s blame the autistic kid! Yeah! He started it! I wanted to wring all of their necks, especially the dean\u2019s.\nDuring the second week I noticed that Nigel was having problems at the bus stop, just two houses over from our house. The bus would pick them up just before I left for work in the morning, and often I would be walking out to my car and hear what was going on. Usually it was an argument: Nigel wanted to talk about Leonardo da Vinci and some girl would tell him to shut up because she didn\u2019t want to hear about it. I didn\u2019t intervene in those situations; I thought it best that Nigel learn that he can\u2019t expect everyone to be interested in what he\u2019s interested in. But one morning as I walked out to the car, I heard laughter. I heard Nigel\u2019s angry tone. I looked and saw seven kids (one from his Boy Scout troop!) standing in a\u00a0semi-circle with their arms crossed, laughing at Nigel. That was unacceptable to me. As I walked over there, one of the kids started walking behind Nigel, mimicking prancing movements, to the other kids\u2019 laughter. I told them how disrespectful and wrong it is to laugh at someone who has autism and communicates differently. I told them I was disappointed in them, especially the Scout. I wondered how many times this had happened before.\nFrom that day on I drove Nigel to school in the mornings. He didn\u2019t want me to (\u201cMom, I want to be just like everybody else\u201d), but I could not subject him to that treatment. The bus company, when they\u2019d heard of what happened, called me to suggest that they send a sped (special education) bus to pick him up in the mornings. I almost guffawed at that! Did they actually think that picking Nigel up in a sped bus, in front of his peers, would help his situation? That would make everything worse! I told them No, thank you. On top of the bus stop issue, the hallway jeers still occurred on a regular basis, and during lunch Nigel was \u201caccidentally\u201d hit in the forehead by a rock.\nIt was at that point that I seriously began to consider homeschooling my son, as I have written before. When I had discovered some options to make that happen, it was late October, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to make the change until January, so I planned on pulling Nigel out of the middle school at Christmas break. He didn\u2019t make it that far. By the end of November, he had been suspended for being disrespectful to a teacher after having a girl verbally bully him in the hallway before class. When he walked in, he was so agitated that he couldn\u2019t sit down, so the teacher ordered him to, and he just couldn\u2019t take any more. \u201cYou need to sit down!\u201d he said, and was suspended for it. The suspension was just a day, but it angered me that an autistic student was being targeted for behavior that was out of his control, after he\u2019d been verbally assaulted by another student, who went unreprimanded because no one had witnessed it.\nThe first week of December I got a call from another dean at the school. Nigel had made an inappropriate, sexually explicit comment to a girl. I almost had a panic attack. This was one of the things I had feared. I\u2019d read stories about parents being taken to court over things their autistic children had said or done, and I begged the dean to explain to the girl\u2019s parents, who were understandably upset, that Nigel is autistic and did not understand what he was saying. I knew before I even talked to Nigel what had happened. A group of boys had encouraged him to do it. They were all standing around laughing, talking about \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be funny if you walked up to a girl and said such-and-such,\u201d and got Nigel to think it was funny. Nigel, at 13, has the emotional maturity of a nine year old, if that, and probably didn\u2019t even understand it to be a sexual comment. I tried explaining this to the dean, but they still suspended Nigel again. I told him that Nigel wouldn\u2019t be back.\nAnd that was the end of the bullying.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/06/05/how-it-ended/", "title": "How It Ended"},
{"date": "June 7, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tWriting this week about my son\u2019s experiences being bullied has been evocative for me, and a bit difficult. I relived a lot of the feelings of anger and desperation I felt, wanting to make it stop, wanting to shout out to the world that this shouldn\u2019t be happening. It shouldn\u2019t happen to anyone. But it does. And it probably will continue to, even with widespread awareness.\nWhy is this so? What causes kids to bully other kids? I struggled to understand it as a young child, when I witnessed developmentally disabled kids at my elementary school being verbally bullied. I knew that I would never do that to anyone. And as I got older, when I was Nigel\u2019s current age, I suffered emotional bullying at the hands of some girls at my junior high. The scars are still with me. Maybe that\u2019s why I became so angry about what was happening to my son. But wouldn\u2019t any parent feel that way?\nI still wonder why some kids are bullies. Perhaps there will never be a definitive answer. Most likely the reasons are different in different situations. I wonder if the kids do it because they themselves have low self-esteem, or are bullied at home in a vicious cycle that perpetuates itself. Or maybe it\u2019s hormones. My mother used to tell me that the girls were mean to me because they were jealous of me. Of what, I could never fathom. I was quiet, introverted, and sensitive. I was a good target, a sure thing. And they got to me every time.\nAutistic kids are good targets. They have odd ways, and some of them get frustrated easily. They are trusting. And some of them will do anything for acceptance, even if they are laughed at. And unfortunately there are NT kids who will exploit all of that. They don\u2019t care about making someone feel bad. Maybe they weren\u2019t taught to care. Who knows?\nThe National Middle School Association Journal provides some\u00a0additional findings from studies: bullies need to feel in control over someone else, bullies tend to have lower academic achievements, bullies tend to be depressed, and bullying is most common in seventh grade. Most disturbing of all is the overwhelming belief that victims of bullying actually brought on the bullying. This was from a school-wide survey taken at several different schools! \u00a0How can we even hope to work against widespread beliefs like that?\nWe will probably never really know the individualized, complex reasons why bullies do what they do. But one slightly reassuring fact (per my internet research) is that bullying is much more common in middle school than in high school. That means that things might be better for Nigel\u00a0when (and if) he\u00a0attends\u00a0the local high school in a little over a year. I\u2019m holding out for that.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nmsa.org/Publications/MiddleSchoolJournal/Articles/January2006/Article2/tabid/693/Default.aspx"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/06/07/wondering-why/", "title": "Wondering Why"},
{"date": "June 10, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nLuke Jackson, the thirteen-year-old author of this book, says he wrote it because \u201cso many books are written about us, but none are written directly to adolescents with Asperger Syndrome. I thought I would write one in the hope that we could all learn together.\u201d And he does an amazing job of appealing to his peers in a colloquial manner.\nI bought this book because I thought that Nigel, as a mid- to high-functioning autistic teen, would understand it and benefit from it. We read it together, so that we could discuss it as we went along. Jackson is English, so I occasionally had to \u201ctranslate\u201d a few words and phrases for Nigel, such as \u201cfancy\u201d for liking something. As we read, many times Nigel\u2019s attention wandered, I think because he found Jackson\u2019s writing style a little hard to follow. But then, Nigel does not have Asperger\u2019s. I have often read that many people view Asperger\u2019s as high-functioning autism, but there are many differences, which I will discuss in a future post.\nBack to the well-written and enlightening book. Jackson\u2019s style is almost precocious at times, but effective. He begins by introducing his close-knit family of seven children and their mother. (There is no mention of his father, that I recall, and I felt dizzy at the thought of parenting seven children alone.) It was interesting to read about their background and personalities. Jackson moves on to a description of Asperger\u2019s and discusses the pros and cons of telling others about it. He relates that when people don\u2019t know he has AS, they refer to him as a freak, but when they know about it, they are tolerant.\nNext is a discussion of obsessions, which he calls \u201cspecialist subjects,\u201d and compulsions. (Nigel was only vaguely interested in this section, which tells me that he does not think of himself as having obsessions.) For the compulsions, Jackson speaks to any parent readers by suggesting that they try to control their child\u2019s compulsions with rewards.\nThe following three chapters concern sensory perception, physiology, and sleep, and Nigel managed to extract some helpful tips for himself. In the area of sensory perception, he agreed that looking at someone while they are talking is often difficult, and he liked Jackson\u2019s suggestion to look at people\u2019s mouths when they\u2019re talking, which is close enough to making eye contact. Of the many suggestions that Jackson made in the sleep chapter, Nigel liked the following metaphor: \u201cMy room and my things are familiar, my security. The dark creeps in and steals that familiarity and security away.\u201d Nigel also agreed that listening to relaxing CDs and music, something that Jackson mentioned, helps him to sleep. The section on physiology discussed, among other things, the GF/CF diet, which was not helpful to us, but certainly has been for others.\nNext Jackson writes about language difficulties, dealing with slang and idioms, and suggests to parents that they\u00a0write out steps to complete a task (which I also find immensely helpful) and give clear and specific instructions. The next chapters deal with school problems and bullying. In the school problems chapter, Nigel identified with the fact that writing with a utensil actually hurts his hand, and this was the first time that the problem registered in my mind. The bullying chapter had some tips for dealing with bullies and stressed that it was important to tell someone. Jackson then mentions Taekwondo for self-defense, as well as the many other benefits it provides.\nThe next three chapters dealt with friendships, dating, and morals and principles. Nigel is just getting interested in the topic of dating and has been asking questions, so this book helped a lot in that area. The \u201cmorals and principles\u201d chapter also was beneficial in that it stressed not to let people entice you to do something that is wrong, that you don\u2019t need friends like that. It reinforced what I tried to teach Nigel at the end of the last school year.\nThe end of the book has a nice positive note about AS people being amazing in their own ways, even if not savants (after a discussion about the movie Rainman). It is certainly amazing for a thirteen-year-old to write such an organized, insightful book. We found it very helpful, including the appendices on idioms (with definitions of being \u201con cloud nine\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t cry over spilled milk\u201d) and references for further information (books, websites, and organizations). All in all, a worthwhile book for parents and kids alike.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Freaks-Geeks-Asperger-Syndrome-Adolescence/dp/1843100983/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1213120622&sr=1-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Freaks-Geeks-Asperger-Syndrome-Adolescence/dp/1843100983/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1213120622&sr=1-1"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/06/10/freaks-geeks-and-aspergers-syndrome-a-user-guide-to-adolescence/", "title": "Freaks, Geeks, and Asperger\u2019s Syndrome: A User Guide to Adolescence"},

I\u2019ll try making lists like these of various topics on a regular basis to contribute to that category.\n1. Communicate with your child. Often kids will not elect to tell parents about bullying, for whatever reason. Nigel said he didn\u2019t want me to worry, so he didn\u2019t tell me until I started noticing his classic stress symptoms: bald spots from pulling out his own hair and badly chapped lips and mouth area. Pick up on any non-verbal cues your child has to indicate stress and then ask them if someone has been bothering them. Sometimes you have to drag it out of them, as I did with Nigel.\n2. Remind your child how smart he/she is and how much you love him/her. Bolster his/her self-esteem as much as you can. Assure your child that you\u2019ll do everything you can to get the bullying to stop.\n3. Contact your child\u2019s teacher(s). Diplomatically state what is happening and offer any suggestions you may have for stopping it.\n4. Within a week check in with your child to see if there are any changes in the situation. Check in with the teacher(s) to see what has been done and report to them what your child has indicated about the situation now.\n5. If the situation has not improved within two weeks, contact the dean or principal. It is a good idea to be familiar with them anyway, because they need to know all of their special needs kids, and they like to be aware of how involved you are as a parent.\n6. Keep tabs on the situation. Keep checking in with your child. I made the mistake of assuming that things were okay and not asking. We must be vigilant advocates. If we don\u2019t advocate for our children, who will?\n7. Be the squeaky wheel. If necessary, have the dean or principal schedule a meeting with the bully\u2019s parents (with the dean or principal in attendance). Do not accept bullying. Unfortunately we can\u2019t all homeschool our children. But what we can do is send a very strong message to the schools that we parents of autistic kids will not tolerate bullying or any form of harassment. Don\u2019t accept \u201cKids will be kids\u201d or \u201cThis is a difficult age group\u201d as excuses for bullying. It\u2019s discrimination against someone with a disability.

{"date": "June 12, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tMost of us have a part of our life that we detest. For some it is a job, or traffic, or a person. What I detest about my life started almost seven years ago, when my children\u2019s father moved seven hundred miles away. I don\u2019t detest him. Or even being a full-time single parent, especially with autism in the picture. What I detest is having my boys gone for several weeks every summer when they visit him. And they just left this morning. I cried in my empty house, missing them already.\nI can tell myself, I need this break, I can enjoy the seven weeks of not stepping on Legos or Nigel\u2019s rocks or sticks or tools left out in the middle of the floor, seven weeks of having a clean house and only myself to cook for, and seven weeks of coming and going as I please. I can remind myself that they need to spend some time with their dad, who loves them and cares for them, whom they miss so much.\nAnd I can distract myself with my household projects that pile up during the year, adventurous activities that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do with my sons (one summer I went skydiving, this year I plan to climb a 14,179-foot mountain), spontaneous weekend trips with only myself to pack up and feed, lengthier trips that I can only afford to do on my own (China three summers ago, Slovakia and Greece last summer). I have also been asked to come back to my job part-time this summer, which will get me out of the empty house and help out my bank account as well.\nAnd so I will make it through these seven weeks, as I do every summer. In earlier years, I couldn\u2019t make it that long without seeing the boys, embracing them, smelling the tops of their heads. About half-way through the summer I would go down to visit them, which I think they needed as much as I did. Now that they are adolescents, I force myself to trust and take a step back. Last summer I did not visit them and will not this summer either (mostly for financial reasons, truth be told). This is hard on us, but it\u2019s making us stronger as individuals, and stronger as a family. It enriches our lives with new experiences (they get to do a lot of fun stuff in LA that they can\u2019t do in southern Oregon) and learning how to work through difficult emotions. But even with the positive aspects I can find in this situation, I miss my sons more than anything.\nAfter they drove off this morning, I walked through the house and saw a pair of Nigel\u2019s socks left out on the living room couch. Two nights ago he had taken them off and lay down on the floor with his feet hanging over the arm of the couch, facing me where I was sitting. He waved at me with his feet, which are now bigger than mine. And I thought of Aidan\u2019s feet, and how he borrowed my water sandals the other day because he\u2019d grown out of his. I wonder how tall they will both be when they return. But mostly I just think of how good it will be to have them home. And even though I love not stepping on errant Lego pieces, I love to see them strategically littered throughout the house, reminding me of my sons, that they will be back before too long, and I will hear their laughter (and occasional bickering) and embrace them and smell the tops of their heads again.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/06/12/its-that-time-of-year/", "title": "It\u2019s That Time of Year"},
{"date": "June 13, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tNow that it\u2019s summer, our first term of homeschooling is over, and I thought I\u2019d write about how it went. Overall, it was wonderful, and so good to know that Nigel was actually learning something instead of being sent to watch a video in the library as he had at the middle school. Considering the fact that I had to pull him out at the beginning of December and wasn\u2019t able to start homeschooling him until mid-February, he learned a lot. We went quickly through all the science and social science subjects but didn\u2019t get as far as I would have hoped in math and language arts. Next year that is what we will focus on.\nI learned a lot about my son\u2019s learning style and how to teach him. He has a semi-photographic memory which helps immensely in fact-memorizing subjects like science and social science, so that\u2019s why we breezed through those. Language arts is challenging because it is difficult for him to organize his mind enough to write an essay, which is what we will spend much of our time on next year. And then there\u2019s math. Nigel, I discovered, is a kinesthetic learner. He learns by doing things, physically taking things apart and putting them back together, climbing, mowing, cooking, sewing, even typing. So I had to figure out a way to teach math kinesthetically.\nI realized as we went along that if anyone had tried to teach him division in the past, they did not succeed. I had to start from the beginning. And what I did was this: I got a bag of raw almonds and pulled out 12 of them. Then I said, \u201cNigel, how many groups of 3 are in 12?\u201d And he looked at the almonds on the kitchen table and he started separating them into groups of 3, and then I saw the light bulb go on in his head. He got it! There was a hint of a smile on his face as he quickly finished separating and then said, \u201cFour!\u201d And then I showed him how that translated on paper with the long division sign, because when we first started going over it, he acted like he had never seen it before. My boy must have just felt so lost at school.\nThe other thing I did in teaching math which helped tremendously was to write out a list of steps for working with fractions, like changing improper fractions into mixed numbers, which I had written about previously. I was smacking my forehead because I didn\u2019t figure this out until near the end of the school year, but at least I did figure it out, and I will certainly be implementing\u00a0the \u201cwritten list of steps\u201d\u00a0technique next year.\nThe last two days of homeschool, I had Nigel take a CD-Rom test, State Standards Middle School Edition. The tests were great, but I\u00a0experienced some aggravating compatibility issues. The tech support guy I spoke to for over half an hour was not sure if it was a Vista issue or my dual-core processor. After uninstalling and reinstalling both Quicktime and the test program, it still takes about\u00a0fifteen minutes to load the program, but once we get the test up and running, the test itself works fine. It\u2019s easy for Nigel to navigate, and at the end it shows his scores in different categories of each subject so that we know which skills he needs to work on next year and in which areas he\u2019s doing well. I\u2019m very satisfied with how homeschooling went for the past four months, and I\u2019m looking forward to next year. I think we\u2019ll both really hit our stride.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.topics-ent.com/details/state_standards.php"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/06/13/homeschool-review/", "title": "Homeschool Review"},
{"date": "June 16, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tHere\u2019s a riddle:\nWhat\u2019s both beautiful and exhausting at the same time?\nAnswer: autism and climbing mountains\nI suppose that giving birth could also be a fitting answer to the riddle, running a marathon and stuff like that. But autism is a part of my daily life, and I just climbed a mountain yesterday, so that is what I\u2019m going to write about.\nEarly Saturday morning, my sister Macrina and I met up with my friend and excellent guide, Tom Prescott (a big shout-out to Tom, without whom we couldn\u2019t have done this), and drove an hour and a half to the trailhead for Mt. Shasta in northern California. We then strapped on our 50-pound frame packs and proceeded to hike five miles to base camp at 10,400 feet. It was brutal! I can hike forever, but I hadn\u2019t thought to train with a heavy pack on, and I wish I had! We got up at 3 AM on Sunday and put on lots of warm layers, crampons, helmets, and smaller day packs with water, our camera,\u00a0and Power Bars. Then we started up the remaining two miles to the summit. Parts were very scary, like when we were climbing up a\u00a0crazy-steep (about 60-degree) slope of snow and ice, literally clinging to the mountain with crampons and ice axes. For someone with a fear of falling (me), it required an intense amount of focus and trust. In what do you trust? Your equipment, your technique (I did some mountaineering research last week, but it was my first time trying it out!), and whatever higher power works for you.\nAt 11:11 AM we reached the summit! Most sources list the elevation as 14,162 feet, but according to Wikipedia, the most current and accurate height per the National Geodetic Survey is 14,179. Here I am with my slightly shorter (but hardier) sister:\n\nAs I marveled at our accomplishment, I thought about how often the difficulties we face in life are likened to climbing a mountain (\u201cClimb every mountain . . .\u201d from the Sound of Music, \u201cI have climbed highest mountains . . .\u201d from \u201cI Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For\u201d by U2). Raising an autistic child has often been like climbing a mountain for me. I don\u2019t know if a summit even exists, but I will keep climbing, I will focus, and I will trust. Life with autism, though sometimes daunting,\u00a0is not insurmountable.\nUpon returning home, I went to Climbingmtshasta.org to read the Summit Log (unfortunately it had to be disabled due to spam, so I was not able to contribute). I was moved by the number of entries from people who said that climbing it changed their lives, and that the spirit of Mt. Shasta will always be with them. I find myself in that category as well. It is a mystical mountain, majestically standing alone, one that I have loved since first seeing it at age seven. Now, exactly thirty years later, I faced my fear and made it to the top.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Shasta", "http://www.climbingmtshasta.org/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/06/16/reflections-at-a-higher-elevation/", "title": "Reflections at a Higher Elevation"},

That is the end of sorrow.\u201d \u2013Buddha\nAs an adolescent I became attracted to Buddhism, but it was nothing that I pursued. Enlightenment sounded peaceful, desirable, but I had other things to do. I thought that someday, if I ever wanted to be affiliated with an organized religion again, it would be Buddhism.\nRecently I came across the above quote and have pondered it for several days. \u201cThe end of sorrow\u201d? The only way to not experience sorrow is to not be attached to anyone. I can isolate what I see, hear, sense, and think. But no matter how enlightened I am, I will certainly feel sorrow when a loved one dies. I will certainly feel sorrow when a loved one is in pain. I will certainly feel sorrow when my children are 700 miles away for seven weeks.\nAnd so I thought, Buddha must not have had children if he devised this method to not experience sorrow. And when I did some research, I discovered that he did indeed have a wife and a son, whom he left at birth when he went off to do his Enlightenment search. And he was gone for seven years. As a sole parent ten months out of the year, this made me not think too highly of Buddha. All my life I had erroneously thought that Buddha had been some solitary prophet, wandering around learning and teaching. Granted, his wife and son lived in a palace, but the fact remains that he abandoned them for his search for Enlightenment. Okay, it was for the greater good, but I still don\u2019t like it. Seven years is a long time.\nBut enough of the Buddha-bashing. I\u2019m still attracted to the peaceful, meditative ways of Buddhism. And, if I think about it, I can even rationalize and accept the fact that Buddha left his family to gain some clarity. I feel that way now, with my children away for seven weeks. I climbed a mountain. I\u2019m writing more, talking less. Meditating, reading. But I miss my boys. Enlightened or not, for me the \u201cend of sorrow\u201d will be when they come home.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahula"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/06/17/buddhas-child/", "title": "Buddha\u2019s Child"},

And you can usually reason with them along the lines of \u201cYou need to graduate from high school so that you can go to college. Or if you don\u2019t go to college, you still need to graduate from high school so you can at least get an entry-level job somewhere. And in order to graduate from high school, you need to take some classes that you don\u2019t like.\u201d And they won\u2019t like this reasoning, but they will eventually see the logic.\nThe autistic teen? Not so much. \u201cYou don\u2019t think like I do.\u201d This is what Nigel tells me after I have tried the above-mentioned reasoning tactic.

That was when survival was more needed than mathematics.\u201d And he is serious.\nThis is what I deal with when I try to teach him algebra and essay writing.

{"date": "May 31, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tSomething . . . strange, but amazing, happened today. I am still in a sort of daze about it.\nI took the boys to see a movie this afternoon, as promised for cleaning their rooms. They wanted to see Ironman, and I wanted to see Prince Caspian, so I decided to try letting them be by themselves. Another exercise for me in trusting and letting go. There have been previous times when we\u2019ve gone to see a movie together and the boys have sat on the opposite side of the theater from me, and there had been no problems, so I thought they would be okay this time with me in a different movie. I bought them a few snacks, walked them into their theater, instructed them not to leave the theater unless they had to go to the bathroom, told them to wait for me in the arcade if their movie finished first, gave them a few dollars for the arcade, and told them I\u2019d be in theater 2 if there was an emergency.\nAbout half-way through Prince Caspian, I became aware of two people standing at the foot of the theater stairs, looking up into the audience for someone. One of them, I realized as my heart jumped into my throat, was Nigel. The other appeared to be a theater manager. Adrenaline coursed through me and I began to shake, thinking that either something had happened to Aidan, or Nigel had done something to cause a problem. Why me? Why now? Why? I dreaded whatever that manager had to tell me.\nI don\u2019t know what my face must have looked like as we stepped into the foyer and I tried to ascertain the mood of the manager. I was full of fear. The manager introduced himself as Mr. Bitteck (I believe) and told me that Nigel had requested a tour of the theater, and that it was fine, but that he needed a parent to come with him. I was in shock. I had braced myself for either horrible news about Aidan or a confrontation about something Nigel had done. I felt a bizarre combination of relief that no one was hurt or causing problems and exasperation that Nigel had not followed my instructions about staying in the theater with Aidan. I asked the manager if we could do the tour after the movies were over, and he said of course. So I thanked him, told Nigel to go back to Ironman and to stay with Aidan, and I wobbled on rubbery legs back to my seat.\nI am glad that I had the remainder of a movie to sit through to be able to sort out my thoughts and feelings. If I didn\u2019t, I might have chastised Nigel for not following my instructions, and I can see now that it would not have been the right time to make an issue out of it. I realized, as tears formed in my eyes during a battle scene of Prince Caspian, that Nigel had actually done something amazing. He went after a dream. He thought of something that he really wanted to do, and on his own he asked around to find someone who could help him. He has always loved movies. I just didn\u2019t realize how much.\nAfter the movie ended, I came out to the lobby and found the boys waiting for me. We asked the ticket taker to page the manager, and he came out and led us on an incredible tour of the projection rooms of the 15-screen movie theater (Cinemark Tinseltown). It was phenomenal. Apparently they only do this when certain individuals request it, and it had been a while since the last time anyone had. I was so impressed by Mr. Bitteck\u2019s professionalism and his acceptance of Nigel as Nigel interjected the tour with trivia about film history involving Thomas Edison and the kinetoscope, the Lumiere brothers, and even the role of Nichola Tesla\u2018s work. Occasionally I would gently remind him, discreetly near his ear, \u201cLet\u2019s listen to Mr. Bitteck,\u201d and he did. Nigel commented that he was excited to see a \u201cpiece of history,\u201d and Mr. Bitteck confirmed that it was indeed just that. Within two years, the theater would be going completely digital. He also took us to an area where they splice the film and, at Nigel\u2019s request, demonstrated how the machine worked. Nigel asked for a sample of the film and Mr. Bitteck offered to give him the spool of film for an entire trailer!! Nigel said, \u201cI feel like I won the Kentucky Derby!\u201d I tried not to cry.\nWe came out of the theater to a gorgeous sunset of purple, orange, and pink. Like the heavens were smiling with us. I drove home almost in a trance. I reveled in the wonder of what my son had accomplished, and what I had experienced because of him. I wished I could remember all the things I learned and all the things Mr. Bitteck had told us. Later, after dinner, I told Nigel that I was proud of him for doing something that was important to him. But then I quietly described to him how afraid I was in the middle of the movie when I saw him with the manager and I didn\u2019t know what it was about. I think Nigel understood. He looked at me, and in the most sincere voice said, \u201cSorry.\u201d And I hugged him and thanked him. Then he gave me a\u00a0five-inch length\u00a0of the film from his trailer. I will keep it forever, probably even frame it.\nLast weekend I saw a really good local R & B band called Annie Mac, and in one of their songs, the vocalist sings, \u201cIf you want something, you gotta ask.\u201d Nigel asked for something that he wanted. At one point during the tour, he turned to Mr. Bitteck and said, \u201cThis is the greatest moment of my life!\u201d I hadn\u2019t told Mr. Bitteck that Nigel had autism because I didn\u2019t think it needed to be mentioned. But I believe he knew that he was in the presence of an exceptional kid.

It\u2019s possible that there may have been some of that going on at school as well,\u00a0but to the best of my knowledge, and from what I was able to extract from him at the time,\u00a0most of the bullying\u00a0started in fourth grade. I don\u2019t remember how it came up, but we were sitting around the dinner table, that hallowed place of family meetings, and he mentioned something about a kid spitting on his jacket. He didn\u2019t want to tell me about it, he said, because he didn\u2019t want me to worry. But I was able to drag out of him that two kids in his class had been cornering him at lunch and spitting on him. And Mama Bear was pissed.\nI called his teacher and told her about it, and she assured me that she would have an aid watch them at lunch. Six weeks later, I noticed that Nigel had been pulling out his hair, so I asked him if the kids were still bothering him. He said yes. I immediately contacted the teacher, this time mentioning that I would call the boys\u2019 parents if this wasn\u2019t resolved quickly. The teacher told me that she would personally make sure it wouldn\u2019t happen again. About two months went by, with me blithely assuming that surely now everything would be okay. Then I noticed another one of Nigel\u2019s old stress indicators: severely chapped lips and mouth. He confirmed that he was still being bullied.\nAt that point I was so angry I was ready to take the school to court.\u00a0This is\u00a0discrimination against someone with a disability. My blood was boiling. I asked the teacher to set up a meeting with the principal and both of those boys\u2019 parents. This ends now, I said. The teacher convinced me that she should have a meeting with the boys\u2019 parents first, since they had not yet been notified, and after I calmed down, I conceded. I must have finally gotten my point across, because two weeks later when I asked Nigel if the boys were still bullying him, he said no. He said that the boys had apologized to him and that they were now \u201cfriends.\u201d\nWell, I guess a state of forced \u201cfriends\u201d is better than ritual bullying. It just burned me to know that I had to throw my \u201cMama Bear\u201d weight around to have them take me seriously. I shouldn\u2019t have had to resort to threatening with litigation. Aside from the bullying issue, both of my kids did really well at that elementary school, and most of the teachers really cared about them. But I would have done whatever was necessary to get that situation resolved. I think they realized that, and that\u2019s why, as far as I know, there were no more bullying issues the remainder of the time (one year) that Nigel attended that school.\nUnfortunately, middle school was\u00a0much worse.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/06/03/because-of-bullies/", "title": "Because of Bullies"},

{"date": "May 8, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tAs I contemplate making old-fashioned macaroni and cheese for dinner tonight, it reminds me that I have been meaning to write a post about the whole GF/CF (gluten-free/casein-free) topic. Over the years, and especially lately with the hey-day surrounding Jennifer McCarthy\u2019s book, my family and friends have forwarded various articles about the GF/CF diet to me, asked if I\u2019ve read the book, or asked me if I might like to try the diet with Nigel. Here\u2019s the short answer: Been there, done that.\nBack in 2000, when Nigel was five and a half, I was on one of my every-three-month trips to Barnes & Noble in search of new autism books. Facing Autism by Lynn M. Hamilton had just come out, and that\u2019s when I first heard of the GF/CF diet. I thought, This is it! This has to work! It made sense. And I was so motivated after reading about the positive results: the increase in language, the decrease of problem behavior, the ability to focus and improve cognitive skills. I so wanted this to work, believed that it would. I immediately went to our local natural foods store and purchased GF/CF bread, cereal, cheese, soy milk, yogurt \u2013 everything Nigel would eat. And he ate it. I could tell he didn\u2019t really like it and wasn\u2019t too enthusiastic\u00a0about it. But I had him stick to it because I knew consistency was key to having the diet work. I told his teachers and therapists so that they wouldn\u2019t give him regular milk and bread or crackers at school. I was so optimistic. Thought I had all the bases covered, that my years of research would finally pay off.\nAnd so I watched my son, hoping to see some improvement after the first week or two. And then going into the third week I began to realize that, not only was he not improving, not talking more, he was actually regressing. I thought, Okay, maybe it will take a little longer. We\u2019ll stick it out. And then going into the fourth week I began to notice that he was looking sickly, he had dark circles under his eyes, was lethargic and had very little appetite. By the fifth week he was even worse, and I had to admit that it was not helping at all. So I scrapped the GF/CF diet, let him start eating the foods he had eaten previously, and within a week he was back to his normal, healthy, neuro-diverse self.\nI\u2019m really glad that I tried the diet. If I hadn\u2019t, I would have always wondered, every day. And I\u2019m truly happy for Jenny McCarthy and all the many parents who have experienced such wonderful success with the GF/CF diet. I wish I could be in that group. I would be a huge advocate of GF/CF, shouting it to the world. And I\u2019m glad that Jenny McCarthy wrote her book, so that more awareness could be raised about the diet and its effectiveness. But the fact is that it doesn\u2019t work for everyone, like every other type of autism intervention therapy out there. In\u00a0a way, though,\u00a0I am an advocate for GF/CF, because I highly recommend to every parent of an autistic child: Try it. It might work for your child.

{"date": "June 3, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tEven before fifth grade had ended, when we had Nigel\u2019s IEP meeting prior to the start of middle school, I had serious doubts. He would go from having had a full-time educational assistant in one classroom to navigating six classes without an assistant. How could he possibly have any hope of success?\nI actually had very few concerns about Nigel being able to make it to his classes \u2013 he loved schedules and could easily follow maps. Getting used to a locker would be no problem \u2013 he loved mechanical stuff like that. What I worried about was how all the kids who didn\u2019t know him would respond to him. I worried about how there would be no assistant to model positive interaction with peers, and to intervene when things went negative.\nNigel was never late to class, which astounds me considering what he had to endure, day after day. With no educational assistant around, the bullies had a field day. The worst of it was in math class, which was difficult enough for him without having kids make faces at him and hiss his name, which they discovered produced the response they obviously wanted. The hissing was hard on Nigel\u2019s ears, distracting, and demoralizing. The faces enraged him, and he could not control his reactions. Of course, the kids only did this when the teacher\u2019s back was turned, so there was no evidence against them. Only against Nigel, who was trying to get them to stop. But they would continue their attack as he walked to his next class, walking close behind him, hissing in his ear, calling him a \u201cfreak,\u201d and I don\u2019t know what else, since that\u2019s all Nigel would tell me. Some of the boys were also in his Language Arts class, and they tormented him there, too. How much fun they must have had riling up the autistic kid, making him lash out so that he would then get in trouble.\nAgain, as in elementary school, I contacted the teacher (this time two). They said that they were unaware that it was going on, so they would have to bring in an aid or student teacher to watch the kids who were doing it and catch them. Wasn\u2019t Nigel\u2019s word enough? Wasn\u2019t my word as a parent enough? Nigel\u2019s rights as a student and a person were being violated, but it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cfair\u201d to confront his attackers without an adult witness?

{"date": "May 7, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nTen years since its initial publication (1998),\u00a0Targeting Autism\u00a0is in its third edition, a testament to\u00a0the book\u2019s\u00a0importance and\u00a0author Shirley Cohen\u2019s\u00a0excellent writing. I about cried with relief when I saw this book on the store\u2019s shelf back in 1998. I needed something to help my extended family understand autism and what we were dealing with. I also needed something for myself that would give me a better picture of what to expect for my son\u2019s future. Targeting Autism addressed both of those needs and more.\nMy first-edition copy is dog-eared and filled with underlined passages. It certainly made the rounds among my family and friends during the early years of my son\u2019s diagnosis! I took a look online to see what changes had been made to the later edition, and it appears that Cohen provides specifics about new developments in the world of autism (including an appendix listing diagnostic criteria for Asperger\u2019s, which\u00a0was not widely\u00a0known\u00a0when the book was first published). Aside from those additions, the book still follows its original outline, starting off with a general description of autism and how the manifestations of it are so varied. It mentions hyperlexia (which my son exhibited) and other unusual abilities, and also compares autism to disorders such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Fragile X, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The next chapter features insightful quotes from autistic individuals who describe what it is like to be autistic and how they felt growing up, fearful and unable to communicate, and later learning about emotions and social expectations. Following that is a chapter about how development progresses at various stages of life: infants and toddlers, preschool, middle childhood, adolescence and young adulthood. It discusses behavior patterns, sensory issues, echolalia, and language development, among other subjects. Here, Cohen inserts many quotes from parents about their autistic children at various ages and levels of severity, which\u00a0is quite helpful. The next chapter specifically addresses family issues: the stress on parents and siblings and the importance of a support network.\u00a0\nPart Two discusses treatment. The first chapter highlights the Lovaas treatment: intensive, 40-to-60-hours-a-week behavioral therapy once thought to be the road to recovery. However, as Cohen ends the chapter, \u201cA distinguished psychiatrist . . . replies that in his contact with over eight hundred individuals with autism he has never seen a person\u00a0who has recovered. What he has seen is symptom remission with near-normal functioning.\u201d The next chapter mentions other types of less extreme behavioral and nonbehavioral treatments, such as mirroring and reciprocal play. It gets a bit technical while discussing the various intervention therapies and educational programs, including TEACHH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication-Handicapped Children) and how it compares to the Lovaas method, but it is essential for parents wanting to know what is out there, so that they can continue to do their own research. The following chapter addresses the issue of treatment availability and funding, and the general topic of advocacy, and the last chapter of this section discusses various alternative therapies, such as supplements like B6 and magnesium and GF/CF diets, auditory integration training (AIT), sensory integration, and facilitated communication.\nPart three begins with an interesting commentary on recovery and the different ways it can be interpreted and defined, including a discussion about the Son-Rise program. The final chapter of the book, Moving Toward Better Answers,\u00a0discusses the future of autism research, treatment (including medication), and public resources. Overall,\u00a0Targeting Autism is an impressive\u00a0proponent of advocacy. Cohen ends by stressing educational planning on an individual basis, especially to meet the needs of adolescents and adults\u00a0so that\u00a0they may\u00a0lead\u00a0productive and satisfying lives.\nI highly recommend this book. Even ten years after I first read it, I still pick up something new and valuable each time I reread it. \u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Targeting-Autism-Children-Spectrum-Disorders/dp/0520248384/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1210110991&sr=1-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Targeting-Autism-Children-Spectrum-Disorders/dp/0520248384/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1210110991&sr=1-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Targeting-Autism-Children-Spectrum-Disorders/dp/0520248384/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1210110991&sr=1-1"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/05/07/targeting-autism-a-review/", "title": "Targeting Autism: A Review"},
{"date": "May 11, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tFourteen years ago I celebrated my first Mother\u2019s Day as a mother-to-be. My then-husband gave me a card saying what a wonderful mom he knew I\u2019d be, and my own mom gave me a card with the same sentiment. I think back to the person I was then, not having any idea of the depth of emotion I would experience because of the little person in my belly and the one who would come after him.\nBeing a mother, autism or no autism, has taught me more about life than anything else I\u2019ve experienced. Just the knowledge that it\u2019s my job, my responsibility, to give these guys all the tools they need to lead a successful, happy life is enough to blow my mind. There are plenty of articles and books out there about how to raise good kids, how to be a better parent, but nothing can really prepare you. You have to jump in with both feet and just trust that you\u2019ll be okay. That you\u2019re going to make a few mistakes, and you\u2019ll run into a few rough spots, but you\u2019ll handle\u00a0them. You\u2019ll get through it\u00a0and keep going.\nAs we moms know, being a mother isn\u2019t always easy but it\u2019s always worth it. We live for the days when we take our kids\u00a0somewhere that they thought would be boring, and then not only can we tell that they really like it (as we knew they would), but they come up to us and hug us and say, \u201cI really like this place, Mom. Thanks for taking me.\u201d (That was Aidan at a museum last weekend.) And we live for the days when our children receive special awards or when, for the first time, they apologize for their behavior on their own instead of us having to do it (that was Nigel recently). We savor the triumphs, be they large or small, and think We\u2019re getting there. I must be doing something right.\nAnd the day will come when they are on their own. Even those of us with differently-abled kids will go through this change, on some level. I often wonder how I will feel when that time comes. How hard will it be to let go? It\u2019s hard enough for me to let them ride their bikes to the grocery store! But I take comfort in the idea that it will happen little by little, just like how Nigel learned to talk, how he\u2019s learning to be responsible for himself. I also take comfort in knowing that I will always be their mom. Nothing will change that.\nSo, here\u2019s to all the good moms, like my own (love you, Mom!), and my friends who keep me sane. We need all the support we can get, in all the mothering stages of our lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/05/11/reflections-on-mothers-day/", "title": "Reflections on Mother\u2019s Day"},

The story intrigued me, and I found the characters both touching and funny. When we got the LP record, I listened to it so much that I memorized many of the lines (um\u2026I guess it runs in the family). Nigel always seemed to forget after I told him that it was my favorite, but I didn\u2019t think too much of it. It could be that it was just a comforting script for him, and\u00a0the repeated asking\u00a0(fortunately not daily!) didn\u2019t bother me too much.\n*\nSeveral years ago, on one of my occasional trips to the bookstore to hunt for autism books (this was back in the days when Barnes & Noble did not have an autism section; the entire special needs category, in a large bookstore, encompassed a single shelf with maybe only one or two books on autism, if I was lucky), I happily discovered Exiting Nirvana by Clara Claiborne Park (who also wrote The Siege). Nigel was seven or eight at the time, and this was the first book I\u2019d read on autism that not only gave me hope, it was actually helpful. I highlighted many passages throughout the book (on almost every page!) because so much of what I read of the author\u2019s daughter reminded me of my son.\nOne of the sections that really stood out to me was about\u00a0her daughter\u2019s development in thinking of others and doing thoughtful things for other people, keeping in mind their needs or preferences. The most memorable part of the book for me was an anecdote that illustrated how, in adulthood, she had finally mastered this. While walking on the beach with her father on a cold and windy day, she decided to go back to the house for a sweatshirt. When she returned, not only did she have her sweatshirt, she had also brought her father\u2019s jacket, unasked. My heart soared just reading about it, thinking that someday my son might do the same.\n*\nMy sons are 700 miles away, visiting their father as they do every summer, and I haven\u2019t seen them for six weeks. We talk on the phone and occasionally exchange little emails, a new development since last year. A month ago, after they had been gone two weeks, Nigel asked me to email him pictures of our cats, so I took some new ones and sent them. The next time we talked on the phone, I asked him if he\u00a0received them, and he said yes and thanked me for them (!), and I thought that was the end of it. I was just happy about the unprompted thank you (a recent\u00a0milestone for him)! \u00a0\nA few days ago, I received the following email from Nigel. It might have taken four weeks for a response, but it was worth it. Imagine my complete delight.\nHi mom, thanks for the photos. So I thought of a photo to send to you in return.

{"date": "October 6, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tI started this blog two and a half years ago, and in that time I\u2019ve had several requests from readers who had an interest in hearing Nigel\u2019s voice, wanting to see (or hear) him in action. I\u2019m guessing that most of them had read some of the earlier posts I\u2019d written about Nigel\u2019s characteristically stoic, flat voice, and either wanted to compare it to their children\u2019s voices or were just curious. Since that time, Nigel\u2019s voice has continued to evolve.

{"date": "November 2, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nNigel, in recent years, has developed a liking for scary movies. Like, horror movies. Granted, they\u2019re not his favorite, and he likes many other types of movies. In fact, he likes most movies, so perhaps he just doesn\u2019t discriminate when it comes to movies. But seriously, how can a kid who loves Winnie the Pooh and Tigger also enjoy horror movies? I\u2019ve tried asking him why he likes them, but of course answering any \u201cwhy\u201d questions is always difficult for him. He said, \u201cWith scary movies, I just think to myself that it\u2019s not really real, so I\u2019m not really scared.\u201d Well, okay then. Let\u2019s move on.\nSo he stepped things up from last year\u2019s zombie theme (he was the zombie killer from The Evil Dead, not a zombie), and this Halloween he decided to be Jason from the Friday the 13th movies. Pretty simple, as far as costumes go \u2013 just buy the hockey mask and put on old clothes. But there was one small problem \u2013 I had told him last year that that was his last year trick-or-treating. At sixteen and 5\u201910\u201d, he\u2019s just too big. But with his five-year emotional delay, that\u2019s like telling an eleven-year-old that he can\u2019t go trick-or-treating anymore. And on Halloween this year, Nigel begged me to let him go \u201cone last time.\u201d\nI gently reminded him that last year was his last time, and in the split second before he could protest, I had a flash of genius. \u201cAnd Nigel!\u201d I proclaimed, \u201cNow you are old enough to open the door for the trick-or-treaters! And you can wear your costume while you give out the candy!\u201d\nHe smiled a little, processing. \u201cBecause I\u2019m almost an adult.\u201d\nWanting to save that conversation for another time, I quickly moved on to describing the duties and \u201cpolicies,\u201d as Nigel put it, of being the candy giver-outer, feeling triumphant that my idea had successfully diverted a tirade. Nigel was delighted about his new role, and I was just as happy about his not-usually-this-easy acceptance of change as I was about being relieved of my annual post for the past nine years. It was time to train the new guy. I told Nigel not to scare the little ones, to say \u201cHappy Halloween!\u201d in a cheerful voice, even though he was being Jason. I instructed him to give out one candy bar (Snickers, of course, and KitKat) per kid. We set up the candy bowl, and he diligently watched out the window.\n\u201cHey, Mom,\u201d he called to me from his spot near the front door, \u201cI thought up a good catch-phrase for myself.\u201d\n\u201cA catch-phrase?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018I left my machete in the shed.'\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but not to the little kids.\u201d\nThe doorbell rang, and I hovered around the corner, out of sight, ready to assist if necessary. I heard some little voices yelling Trick or Treat! One said, \u201cI like your mask.\u201d Nigel, confused for a second, dutifully said Thanks, and then Happy Halloween! before closing the door. \u201cMom!\u201d he called out in an amused tone,\u00a0\u201cThere were three little Dorothys!\u201d I laughed to myself then, realizing that the ones I thought would be scared of his costume actually had no idea who he was supposed to be and weren\u2019t scared at all. He was just a guy wearing a hockey mask.\nSure enough, as time went by and the older kids started coming, I heard Whoa, that\u2019s kinda scary as he opened the door. His tone of voice changed from being cheerful and friendly (to the littler kids) to sounding a little more foreboding as the evening went on. He employed his \u201ccatch-phrase\u201d a few times, and when someone asked for a second piece of candy, he answered in his typically flat, deep voice, \u201cThe policy is one piece of candy.\u201d At my spot around the corner, I stifled a guffaw.\nEven with Nigel\u2019s strict adherence to policy, we ran out of candy by 8:30 and had to shut off all the lights in the front rooms of the house. Then we went back to the family room with the few pieces I\u2019d fortunately squirreled away, and Nigel humored me while we watched one of my all-time faves, Disney\u2019s animated The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Not very scary, of course, but it was the perfect ending to my favorite Halloween ever.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/11/02/the-new-guy/", "title": "The New Guy"},
{"date": "August 10, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nSometimes I think that the last sixteen years of my life have all been one big Plan B. One long divergent path. Sixteen years ago I graduated from college and, through no fault of my own, started having children long before Plan A had stipulated. Having two children with special needs was not in Plan A. Autism (although it starts with A!) was not in Plan A. Divorce \u2013 no. Single parenting? No way in hell was that part of Plan A.\nAnd so I learned that I didn\u2019t just need to have a Plan B, I was constantly living it. We all do to some extent \u2013 life takes different twists and turns, and we all must adapt to change, some of it completely unexpected. Plan B has to happen whether you planned for it or not, whether it was an actual plan or a split-second decision. You go into the grocery store, race around throwing a few things into your cart, hoping that your distressed autistic child can hold it together for just a few more minutes, and then someone turns on an electric coffee grinder and it all goes out the window. Your child shrieks and tries to bolt, and it\u2019s time for Plan B. You leave the blasted cart in the blasted store and carry your hysterical child out to the blasted car, dragging your other reluctant child by the arm because you can\u2019t leave him in the store because he\u2019s a toddler for God\u2019s sake and you\u2019re a blasted single parent. Everybody\u2019s either shrieking or crying or kicking you or pulling on you or staring or shaking their heads at you. And you still didn\u2019t get the few groceries you needed. Plan B sucks. Sometimes, even, it\u2019s the loss of a job, a home, or a loved one \u2013 and then Plan B takes on a whole different persona, a whole different significance. It\u2019s no longer just a new plan. It\u2019s a safety net. Those, of course, are the most life-altering Plan Bs of all.\nBut I\u2019ve also learned that Plan B, whether big or small, doesn\u2019t always have to suck. Sometimes Plan B can even offer some comfort in disguise. And even though it\u2019s not what you wanted or hoped for, you can make it work. It\u2019s not Plan A, but in most cases, you can live with it, sometimes because you have no other choice. Slowly you get used to it. And you might even warm up to some aspects of it.\u00a0\nMy latest Plan B, in a long string of Plan Bs (sixteen years\u2019 worth), involved what to do after I\u2019d moved my two teenage boys seven hundred miles away to live with their father in Los Angeles while I stayed in Oregon to sell the house. First, Nigel\u2019s IEP wasn\u2019t amended so that he could go to a special school for students with autism. So we came up with the Plan B of their father moving to a better school district in the L.A. area, one that had a good special education department. Meanwhile, I felt so confident with the timing of this major change in our lives that I was certain my house would sell before August. Surely one of those two things would work out. But neither one did.\nSo technically, we\u2019ve moved onto Plan C at this point, or perhaps Plan Q by now. The boys are coming back to Oregon and will attend the same schools that they did last year. I have taken my house off the market. I\u2019ll have to work extra hard to get Nigel\u2019s team to meet his academic needs, which is the whole reason why I wanted him to go to the special school in the first place. But here\u2019s the wait-a-minute moment, the half-the-battle factor \u2013 Nigel loves his school here in Oregon. He has friends here, he\u2019s comfortable here, he\u2019s safe, and he\u2019s happy. Why would I want to mess with that?! Well, there are two reasons why \u2013 one, his father\u2019s not here. Two, the school hasn\u2019t yet figured out how to teach him to work independently. And those are pretty significant reasons.\nIn spite of that, every day I\u2019m feeling better about this particular Plan B. The boys will be back at familiar schools in which they are comfortable. And I don\u2019t have to find a new job (even the thought of that was a huge stress for me \u2013 those of you going through it, you have my deepest empathy). Those are pretty significant reasons too. And so, although Plan B isn\u2019t what I\u2019d hoped for (is it ever?), I can live with it. It might turn out just fine after all.\n\nThese photos are of\u00a0our much-loved and oft-climbed tree, which split in half a few years ago during a storm.

{"date": "October 13, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tThat\u2019s my friend Carrie\u2018s acronym, NEHBM. It stands for not enough has been made, usually in reference to some little or not-so-little thing that a person in our life says or does that is worthy of appreciation, such as a teacher or aide who shares in our children\u2019s small developmental coups, something that other people might not notice. Such as a friend\u2019s relative who doesn\u2019t mind when our children take off their clothes at a family barbeque. Such as the woman in the public restroom who says \u201cI understand\u201d when our children start screaming because someone flushed a toilet or started the air hand dryer. These are the compassionate people who get it, and NEHBM of the fact that they do.\nOur family has been blessed with many people like that over the years (including all three of the ones mentioned above). We\u2019ve also been blessed with some truly wonderful friends. Several years ago, in his quest for friendship, Nigel discovered The Goonies and picked a few boys from his Scout troop to be his group of friends, like he saw in the movie. A few times a year, they would come over to our house to hang out, and Nigel would have them sit on the couch and watch The Goonies while he recited the lines and assigned them roles to play. And they would be compassionate good sports and watch the movie with him, attempting to act out the parts as he directed. But, of course, things change. In recent years, one of the three boys opted not to come around anymore, and another one moved out of state, leaving only one to be Nigel\u2019s remaining \u201cGoonie\u201d friend.\n\nNEHBM of that one friend. A couple of weekends ago, Nigel decided that he wanted to ride his bike over to N\u2018s house (about a mile and a half away) to see if he wanted to hang out. I suggested that he call N first to make sure he was home before he rode all the way over there, so he did. N wasn\u2019t home and Nigel left a message on their answering machine. He had done this before with the other two friends and not heard back either for several days or not at all. Nigel\u2019s disappointment was always palpable. But that night, N called Nigel back. Not only did he say he was sorry he wasn\u2019t home earlier, he invited Nigel to come over after school one day the following week. Wait \u2013 did you catch that italicized part? That sort of thing just doesn\u2019t happen for Nigel, and he was elated. So was I. A few days later, Nigel went over to N\u2018s house, had a fun visit, and rode his bike home at the agreed-upon time. Like any regular teenager might do. Like autism didn\u2019t matter that day. After a lifetime of always being different, that afternoon was such a gift \u2013 both for Nigel and for me.\nN\u2018s mom and I have also become friends over the years, and I can\u2019t thank her enough for being the kind of parent we all wish there were more of, and for raising the kids that we all wish there were more of. Cheryl, my friend, thank you so much for all that you are and all that you do.

{"date": "October 27, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nHello, it\u2019s me, Nigel.\nMy plans for my 16th birthday, which actually is today,\u00a0are of going to the Family Fun Center with my friends to have the party there on Friday. The Family Fun Center is where you can play video games or do some stuff outside like the batting cage, mini golf, or my favorite thing to do, in my opinion, is the go-karts. I\u2019m really wanting to get my learner\u2019s permit in driving, because I feel free, when I have my own ride.\n\nThings at school are going fine for me, I have Algebra I, Video I, Theater Arts II/III, English 10, Life Science, and two study periods. As for my favorite class, I have two favorites, Video I and Theater Arts II/III. Speaking of which, for my theater class, I wrote a script for a musical play that I suggested to them. The homecoming dance was fun and exciting. But not as\u00a0much as my uncle\u2019s power washer. This is what I call empowering.\n\nAs for how I feel about my autism, I feel just fine about it. Earlier in the month, I saw the Temple Grandin film and it showed me someone else\u2019s life that was sort of similar to mine. For when I grow up, I\u2019m just wanting to be a filmmaker. Here\u2019s one of my first short films, \u201cAllosaurus Attack\u201d:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/10/27/sixteen/", "title": "Sixteen"},
{"date": "October 19, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tI know of several teenagers and several adults, both on and not-on the autism spectrum, who don\u2019t drive or don\u2019t want to. It could be because they realize that they\u2019re too easily distracted, or that they know it\u2019s a huge responsibility and don\u2019t feel ready or comfortable, or even that they simply aren\u2019t interested. I\u2019m sure there are many reasons why people who don\u2019t drive do not. Unfortunately, my son, who was diagnosed with autism at age three and didn\u2019t start talking until age five, does not feel that any of those reasons apply to him. He wants to drive. And he turns sixteen next week.\nNigel has always wanted to be like everybody else. I know this because even before he could talk, he would try to interact with other children by going up to them and laughing in their faces or bumping into them in the hopes that they would play with him. Without words, he tried to engage them. When he started learning to talk, he would go up to kids at a playground, repeat lines from his favorite movies, mixing up words he didn\u2019t know, and the other kids would ask, \u201cWhat language is he speaking?\u201d Years later, when he was being bullied at the bus stop, I told him that I would drive him to school instead. His response: \u201cBut I just want to take the bus so I can be like everybody else.\u201d He is nothing if not determined.\nI know that there are people on the autism spectrum who can and do drive. But Nigel is just not there yet, and it may be a while. It has nothing to do with his ability to operate a vehicle. If anything, that will be his strength. The problem is his high distractibility. And his five-year emotional delay. Those are the main things standing in the way of him getting his driver\u2019s license. I wouldn\u2019t feel confident with an eleven-year-old driving, even if he is 5\u201910\u201d. \nI\u2019ve written about this subject before and received all sorts of well-meaning comments ranging from letting him practice so that he gets familiar with the feel of the car (definitely not the issue), to letting him race go-karts (he has for years), to the patronizing all-parents-are-nervous-about-their-kids-driving (not the same thing). Of course all parents are nervous about their kids driving. When my younger son, fourteen and not autistic, starts driving, I will be worried. But nowhere near as worried as I am about Nigel driving, that\u2019s for certain. It\u2019s a far different level of nervousness. They\u2019re both my sons, and on that level I worry equally, but one son has major challenges with judgment and awareness. And on that level I\u2019m far more nervous.\nWhen Nigel started talking about wanting to drive around five years ago, I almost had a panic attack. He knew then that he would have to wait, but I knew that he would have to wait longer than he anticipated. Last year when he turned fifteen, I talked with him about that, but he still wanted to know when. He wanted to know just how long he would have to wait. I told him that we\u2019d revisit the idea in a year, and he has repeatedly reminded me in the past month that the time has come. Ugh.\nWhy, oh why, did I have to have the kid with autism who wants to drive and progressed to the point where maybe he can, but maybe he can\u2019t?? How will he handle the disappointment if it\u2019s determined that he can\u2019t drive? He\u2019s not content to just maneuver the car around an empty parking lot or down a dirt road. Driving go-karts, though still fun, is not nearly enough. He wants his learner\u2019s permit, and he wants it badly. \nAnd there\u2019s my answer, if I\u2019m aware enough to realize it. He\u2019ll pass the written test (I\u2019m sure with flying colors, due to his near-photographic memory), and he\u2019ll get his permit. And maybe, for now, that\u2019s all he wants. He wants to have his learner\u2019s permit like \u201ceverybody else.\u201d He just wants to have it. And I\u2019m hoping that having it will satisfy him for a while. I know that eventually he\u2019ll want to get out on the street, but we don\u2019t have to hit the road anytime soon. And when he starts asking to do that, I\u2019ll sign him up with a professional driving instructor. I\u2019ll still worry, of course. But at least I don\u2019t have to yet.\nAnyway, I\u2019m hoping.\n**UPDATE** Two month after this post was written, Nigel had two more seizures and, after a 24-hour EEG and MRI, was diagnosed with epilepsy. He never obtained his permit and, at 18, still does not drive.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/10/19/license-to-worry/", "title": "License to Worry"},

{"date": "December 1, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tAnd\u2026we\u2019re back!\nIt was the kind of trip that made a day feel like a week because it was so full, everything in it so new. It was the kind of trip that left even the kids with no desire to watch TV in the hotel room at the end of the day. We tried to read and all three of us dozed off within ten minutes. \u00a0At 8:00 PM. Of course, that was probably the jetlag, but still. A full trip, indeed.\nThe boys did great on the planes, all 21 hours\u2019 worth (just to get there). The three of us met my dad in Bangkok. He had been staying in the northern part of Thailand for a week and flew down the day before we arrived. Nigel\u2019s only issue on the plane was not wanting to sit next to any \u201cstrangers,\u201d and when it was his turn to do so, he started to have an anxiety attack. This was somewhat unexpected \u2013 he is usually so social (yeah, I know \u2013 autism and social sounds like an odd co-description, but it happens) that I didn\u2019t think it would be a problem for him, or else I would have prepared him better. \u00a0I just didn\u2019t think of it at all. Seeing the writing on the wall as Nigel started to escalate there on the plane, I quickly switched seats with him, much to Aidan\u2019s chagrin. \u201cDon\u2019t give in to him, Mom;\u201d I\u2019ve heard it before. \u00a0I tried to explain to Aidan that it was not a good time for a teachable moment. \u00a0I always feel that I lose respect in his eyes when I have to do things like that. It comes with the territory, unfortunately.\nLots of things come with the territory when you travel with someone who has special needs, of course. The two that affected us the most were food preferences and wandering. I took a risk embarking on an international trip with a child who wanders, but it was a calculated risk. Nigel has a history of wandering in public places, even fairly recently. I would never have attempted a trip like this in his younger years, or even two years ago. But I felt confident that at this point the risk was manageable. And he did wander once \u2013 at the Ayutthaya ruins, the highlight of the trip for him \u2013 but I quickly noticed and found him within five minutes. Of course, I was beating myself up the entire five minutes (which felt like twenty), but it was really just my PTSD kicking in. My rational mind knows that he can pretty much hold his own these days.\nEnough of the negative stuff! We had clear skies the whole week, and all of our tours went off without a hitch. My dad treated me to no less than three (!) Thai massages, including one on the beach! Aidan\u2019s stomach bothered him a little one night, but other than that, no one got sick. And other than a few mosquito bites, no one was injured. A successful trip on all counts! And without further ado, I give you\u2026the pictures:\n\nAidan on the plane, right before I switched seats with Nigel.\n\nNigel on the balcony of our tenth-floor hotel room.\n\nOn a khlong boat on the Chao Phraya river, which flows through the middle of Bangkok and most of Thailand.\n\nAlong the river sits Buddhist temple Wat Arun, which means \u201cTemple of the Dawn,\u201d with its Khmer-style tower, approximately 80 feet high.\n\nWith Dad at the base of Wat Arun, photography by Aidan.\n\nGuardians at Wat Arun\n\nClimbing Wat Arun\u2019s scary-steep stairs!\n\nAidan (in red shirt) at the bottom stair landing of Wat Arun.\n\u00a0\nAlong one of the canals of the Chao Phraya river. Bangkok is nicknamed \u201cVenice of the East.\u201d\n\nThe famed Floating Market, where Aidan bought a cool wooden crossbow as a souvenir. Even with my suggestions, Nigel had great difficulty choosing a souvenir, saying, \u201cEverything is so unfamiliar to me.\u201d Finally he settled on a giant, one-inch-diameter pencil, stating that he could use it as a prop in his films. I guess it was the only thing that looked familiar to him! But still, his souvenir from Thailand is a pencil.\n\nDad purchased a coconut from a floating vendor who cut it right then and there and stuck in the straws for us (that\u2019s the top of the coconut, not a drink umbrella). It doesn\u2019t get\u00a0much fresher than that!\n\nEven Nigel drank it!\n\nAh, coconut palms\u2026they were everywhere, and I loved seeing them.\n\nAt the Bridge on the River Kwai (about an hour from Bangkok). Nigel did some filming here. Not only did I have to keep my eye on him, I also had to make sure he didn\u2019t set his video camera down anywhere. Can you imagine the meltdown if he\u2019d lost it?\n\nAt the Tiger Temple (two hours north of Bangkok).\n\nNigel with a \u201creal Tigger\u201d!\n\nSome of the many buddhas in Thailand.\n\nWalking around Wat Po, aka Temple of the Reclining Buddha.\n\nNigel standing guard.\n\nAidan\u2019s favorite (because of the top hat!)\n\nMealtimes were interesting! Nigel subsisted on fruit, rice, and the doughnuts served with the hotel\u2019s continental breakfast. Aidan, the pickier eater, dove in and tried pad thai, among other things!\n\nChakri Mahaprasat Hall at the Grand Palace.\n\nThe boys at the Grand Palace.\n\nAt the beach at Pattaya \u2013 Nigel did not enjoy himself and remained in the beach chair the entire time \u2013 two whole hours! Both boys discovered on this trip that they were not fond of humidity.\n\nExhausted at the end of another full day.\n\nAt the ruins of Ayutthaya, the ancient capital of Siam. The boys said it was too hot to smile.\n\n\n\nWe declined taking the elephant tour around Ayutthaya. If it was too hot for us, we thought it would be too hot for them as well.\n\n\nMore ruins.\n\nAidan taking a breather.\n\u00a0\nDad/Grandpa filming the ruins.\n\n\n\nThanksgiving dinner at our favorite restaurant in Bangkok \u2013 The Waterfront. Incredible food and ambiance \u2013 alfresco, and literally right over the river.\n\nOn our way home, we had an eleven-hour layover at LAX \u2013 perfect! Nigel and Aidan\u2019s dad came and picked them up\u00a0and spent the day with them, and one of my sisters came to get me. I freshened up at her apartment and then we went winetasting with our brother! It was such a treat to see both of them, and a wonderful end to the trip. Massages in Thailand and winetasting fresh off the plane \u2013 yep, that\u2019s how we roll.

But there are, of course, times when our intuition kicks in, we get a hunch, and it\u2019s not a good one. We hope like hell that we\u2019re wrong.\nI wrote recently that I\u2019d been noticing what appeared to be postictal signs from Nigel, that I thought he might have some seizure activity going on even though I hadn\u2019t witnessed it. Unfortunately I was right. He had a seizure on New Year\u2019s Eve while visiting his father. What timing, right? Way for 2010 to get in one last jab on its way out. \u00a0Anyway, Nigel\u2019s okay; apparently it was milder than the first one. But still \u2013 I so wish I had been wrong. A new year began just a few minutes after I received the call from my ex-husband, and I paced the hallways of my home, crying and swearing at autism for providing yet another issue to continue worrying about. Sobbing about how it never ends. Wishing, again, that I had been wrong.\nBut the next day, somehow, I felt better. It was a beautiful, clear New Year\u2019s Day (a clean slate!), and I felt determined not to let the event of the previous night get me down. That evening I picked up my boys from the airport (they flew alone again!) and we drove home. It was so good to have them with me, to hug them (even though one can\u2019t really hug back), and to feel the peace that their presence brings me.\nI also felt better because I know that I\u2019m not alone in my experiences. I have been blogging for almost three years now, and it has been my lifeline. I cannot put into words how much I have benefited from all the encouragement and advice I have received from readers and fellow bloggers out there. That\u2019s right, from you. You reading this right now, my friends. You have offered much-needed recommendations when I was searching and deciding about medication. You have celebrated Nigel\u2019s accomplishments with me and lauded his progress. And you have empathized; you have supported me when I worried. There are so many more posts I could link to. Through your beautiful comments and your generous emails you have buoyed me up and helped me along this leg of the journey. My gratitude is boundless.\nAnd so, I\u2019m very sorry to say that I\u2019m at a point where I need to stop blogging. This post is my swan song for TeenAutism.com. Basically, as much as I\u2019ve loved blogging, my energy \u2013 what little there is \u2013 is needed elsewhere in my life. Aidan will soon be doing something that will change his life, and Nigel\u2019s, and mine. But he is fourteen, and that is his story to tell, should he choose to. He deserves so much more of my energy than I have been able to give him over the years, so I want to focus on him now as much as I can. Nigel, of course, will continue to consume a lot of my energy, and whatever\u2019s leftover I hope to channel into some more fiction writing.\nI wish I had more time and energy so that I could continue to blog \u2013 to do this thing I have enjoyed immensely. I feel like I\u2019m leaving so much unfinished! For example, I\u2019d wanted to post a book review of Late, Lost, and Unprepared: A Parents\u2019 Guide to Helping Children with Executive Functioning. I\u2019m not even half way through it, but I can already tell that it\u2019s a fantastic resource, and I highly recommend it. Another thing I wanted to do was get back to the \u201cWhat It\u2019s Like\u201d series that I started a while ago. I wanted to hit up my wonderful extended family members for interviews about what it\u2019s like to have a nephew and grandchild with autism. I wanted to talk more with Aidan about what it\u2019s like to have a brother with autism, and write about it. I wanted to do posts called \u201cWhat It\u2019s Like to Have a Child with Autism\u201d and even \u201cWhat It\u2019s Like to Have Autism,\u201d from Nigel\u2019s viewpoint. Then I thought about it, and I realized that it\u2019s all here, contained in the existing posts of this website. The social challenges, the sensory issues, the bullying, the obsessive thoughts, the medication and therapy, and much more.\nIt\u2019s all here.\nBut there are so many unanswered questions about Nigel as he\u00a0closes in on\u00a0adulthood \u2013 will he drive, will he continue to have seizures, will he be able to have a job, live independently? How will he be as an adult? Some of that I might mention on Facebook periodically, if you\u2019d like to find me there. I\u2019ll also keep this site up with a home page that I\u2019ll update from time to time with information about how Nigel\u2019s doing. This website has become the resource that I was looking for over three years ago as Nigel entered his teens and I searched desperately for information. Not finding much, I decided to create TeenAutism.com. I figure there will be many more parents Googling \u201cautism in the teen years,\u201d and I\u2019d be honored if they might consider any of my 436 posts to be a resource for them. I\u2019m also touched by the fact that many parents find this site by searching the phrase \u201cso proud of my son blog.\u201d Because I am \u2013 of both of them.\nMy friends, I want to thank you once again for being there, for being part of our lives, for joining us on the journey. I appreciate you more than I can say. I leave you now with one last Nigelism:\nThe Scene: Interior of suburban family home. A mother enters the bedroom of her teenage son who has autism. She is coming to say goodnight to him, and he is in his bed, expecting her. As is their nightly ritual, she shuts off the bedroom light and comes over to the side of his bed to kiss his forehead and tell him she loves him. As she leans over and kisses him, he holds out his arm and reaches over to turn on the small light on the headboard of his bed.\nTeen son (softly): I can\u2019t see you. Let\u2019s do it again so I can feel like I\u2019m not alone.\nMother (with lump in throat): Oh, honey. You\u2019re not alone.

Hope is the thing that gets us from one day to the next. And those days turn into weeks and months and years, until finally we look back, exhausted but still hopeful, and see where those hopes have taken us.\nMy hopes have certainly changed over the years, evolving and developing as my son has. I remember hoping when he was six years old and learning to talk that someday we could have a conversation. I remember hoping that someday he would stop screaming and bolting away from me in parking lots or other public areas when a noise startled him. And I remember hoping, as he started talking more and bolting less, that someday I could take him on an international trip with me. That he would be safe, and that he might even enjoy it. Because I love to travel \u2013 my whole family does \u2013 and someday I wanted to share that with him. It\u2019s a frivolous hope, I know \u2013 unimportant, and certainly nowhere near a matter of life or death. And in the grand scheme of things, in all of the hopes that I\u2019ve had and still have for my son, I can assure you that international travel was low on the totem pole. But still, it was there.\nLast month, after a year of planning, both of my sons (one with autism, one without) accompanied me to Thailand, where we met up with my father on his annual Thanksgiving in Thailand trip. We had purchased our plane tickets back in February, timing our departure with the school district\u2019s break for the US holiday. What we didn\u2019t know was that our arrival date coincided with the festival of Loi Krathong (pronounced loy krah-tong), a Thai holiday that takes place on the evening of the full moon of the twelfth month in the traditional Thai lunar calendar. In the western calendar this usually falls in November. And this year, it just happened to be on the day that we arrived.\nIt was night when we flew into Bangkok and checked into our hotel. We slept well and had continental breakfast before heading out for a stroll that morning. Everywhere we walked, people sat outside making and selling krathongs \u2013 handle-less baskets traditionally crafted from intricately folded banana leaves and loaded with flowers, incense sticks, candles, and other offerings. They are beautiful in and of themselves, but it\u2019s what they symbolize that really hit home with me. The krathongs are released into waterways across Thailand as offerings of hope \u2013 an opportunity to wash away the past year\u2019s misfortunes and let go of resentment or fear, so that one can start fresh, with hope for good fortune in the future. A festival about hope! How wonderful is that?\nThat night, after a lovely outdoor international banquet at our riverfront hotel, we watched as the locals picked up their krathongs and walked down to the dock when it was dark. There they stood, holding their krathongs in front of them, eyes closed and heads bowed for a moment as they meditated. Then they placed their krathongs in the river and watched them float away. Parents held their children by the hand as they walked to the dock, bent down, and, it appeared, instructed them about what to think of before they released their krathongs into the river. I watched in wonder; I was so moved by this beautiful tradition. \nThen it was our turn. The hotel had provided pretty krathongs for its guests, and we each picked one out, lit our candles, and slowly walked to the dock. I thought about all the things I needed to let go of in my life \u2013 fear, resentment, stress, sadness. I thought about all the hopes and dreams I have for my children and myself and the fact that at that moment, where we stood there on the dock of a river in Thailand, one of my hopes had come to fruition. We were there; we had made it. I released my krathong, and then I looked out across the river and saw dozens of tiny candle flames floating down it, bobbing along in the water. And I watched as my family\u2019s krathongs floated away together and bobbed along with the rest of them. \nThe remainder of our trip was just as magical. We had our challenges, of course, as my son (now 16) still has a tendency to wander and has a very limited palate. But overall we were blessed with safe travels and wonderful memories. And hope that continues to evolve.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/12/19/hope-on-a-river/", "title": "Hope on a River"},
{"date": "December 9, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tIt\u2019s that weird time of year \u2013 too busy to make sure my head is on straight, but enjoying fun family traditions at the same time. For about four years when the boys were younger we used to go up into the mountains surrounding our valley and cut down our own Christmas tree. I LOVED doing that, like Little House on the Prairie. We would obtain a tree-cutting permit, pack a picnic lunch, and drive up into the mountains, hike around in the snow, pick out our tree, saw it down and tie it to the roof of the car. Then we\u2019d drive back home, bring it inside, and decorate it while listening to Christmas music. About eight years ago, on our way back down from the mountains, we slid on some hard-packed snow and nearly collided with another car as we headed toward the edge of the road. I don\u2019t even want to think about what would have happened if our car hadn\u2019t stopped \u2013 inches from the other car, and inches from the edge of a scary ravine. That did it for me. No more getting the Christmas tree in the mountains.\nSo the next year, oddly enough, I started seeing signs for a local U-Cut Christmas Tree Farm, and it turned out to be in a lovely rural area just seven minutes from our house! I was so excited \u2013 all the fun of choosing and cutting down your own Christmas tree without the danger of driving off the edge of a snow-packed mountain road! (I was also excited that I didn\u2019t have to plan and make a picnic lunch, but that\u2019s not really worth mentioning.)\n\nThus began our current tradition of going to the charming U-Cut farm mere minutes from our home, in the foothills of southern Oregon. We sleep in on Saturday morning, have brunch, and then off we go to pick out our tree. Last year Nigel did the cutting, so this year Aidan wants to. He picks out a gorgeous specimen, and Nigel gets the sawing started for him, about an inch into the trunk. I pull out my camera and Nigel retorts, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to document the strain of sawing the tree,\u201d (!) at which point I suggest that Aidan take over.\n\nAfter ten minutes of valiant effort, Aidan successfully cuts down the tree and poses for one of my favorite shots of him, ever:\n\nWe get home and Nigel elects to put his tired, grouchy self in bed for a nap (more on that in a minute). Aidan helps me get the tree in the stand, and we notice that it is the largest we\u2019ve ever had \u2013 the tallest and the fullest. We cut a little off the bottom and the top, get it upright, sweep the surrounding area (at which point we discover that Aidan had stepped in dog crap at the U-Cut Farm), and clean everything up. Finally, we put on the Christmas music, and I string the lights while Aidan plays with the ornaments.\n\n\nSince the boys were toddlers we\u2019ve had the same star on top of our Christmas tree \u2013 an impressive 16-point tin star with holes punched in it for the light to shine through. I think it had been made in Mexico, and it was so pretty. But last year it just fell apart and could no longer be used. So this year I had to get something really special to replace it. Something I knew that the boys would love. See there? That green glow at the top of the tree?\n\nYeah, that\u2019s right. I got the Yoda Tree Topper.\n\nWe save some ornaments for Nigel to hang, and I get him out of bed after two hours, not wanting him to nap too long. Here\u2019s the thing: I think something\u2019s going on with him lately, like, possible seizure activity. At first I thought it was jetlag, but we\u2019ve been back for two weeks, and there have been other signs, some that appear to be postictal. Ironically, the week before I noticed anything, we had already gone to the neurologist\u2019s office at the request of Nigel\u2019s regular doctor as a follow-up to his major seizure in June. And so when the neurologist suggested doing both an MRI and an EEG, at first I thought Fine, we\u2019ll just do it, even though I didn\u2019t think it was necessary. But now I do. Something\u2019s going on, and it\u2019s not just residual jetlag. And it just so happens that his tests are scheduled for next week.\nThe staying up with him next Thursday night for the EEG? Not fun. The worrying about what\u2019s going on in his brain? So not fun. But I do feel fortunate that the appointments had already been made before I started noticing stuff \u2013 an example of things coming together just when they need to. I\u2019m anxious, but hopeful, as always. It\u2019ll be good to get the tests out of the way so that we can enjoy the holidays \u2013 and all the rest of our traditions, old and new.\n***UPDATE: 12/17*** Both tests are now out of the way, and Nigel did really well with them! We just got back from the EEG a little while ago, and he is now napping  Of course, we have to wait a few weeks for the results, but at least we can catch up on sleep this weekend! Thank you all for your prayers and well-wishes.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/12/09/the-fun-and-the-not-fun/", "title": "The Fun and the Not Fun"},

{"date": "January 4, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nWhen I started this blog almost three years ago, I had this vision of the post I would write when Nigel graduated from high school. Obviously, I would write about how incredibly proud I was of him, how much he had taught me through the years, how consuming my love was for him, and how hopeful I was for his future. And I would post a short video of him receiving his diploma. I imagined that one of my relatives would be filming so that I could watch my son, who had always tried so hard, harder than anyone I know, and struggled so fiercely. I envisioned that the person filming would film me for a few seconds standing there, crying as I watched him, and when I noticed that they were filming me I would hide my face and wave them away, saying, \u201cFilm him, not me!\u201d And the person would zoom in and film Nigel, focusing on his beautiful, serious face, self-aware of his accomplishments and determined about his future.\n*\nAll his life Nigel has told me, whether through behavior or words and often both, what he needed. And I have learned to listen (and\u00a0be attentive). He would tell me, by screaming and bolting, that a sound or an environment was too loud, too overwhelming, and he had to get out of there. He would tell me by rubbing his lips until all the skin around his mouth was red and cracked that his anxiety level was too high. And later, when he had the words to do so, he would beg me to homeschool him because mainstreaming was too torturous with the bullying he endured. After a year and a half of homeschooling, he\u00a0would tell\u00a0me that he wanted to try some medication that would help him to regulate his behavior so that he could go back to regular school, because he never stopped trying. A year later, he would tell me that he felt he had learned to regulate his behavior himself and that he no longer needed the medication. And he was right.\nTwo weeks ago, after a discussion about the dismal state of his grades and the fact that he is not aware of any executive function skills class that he is supposed to be in, he told me that he thinks he needs to get a modified diploma. His anxiety level has been so high that he has been pulling out his hair incessantly for weeks. He feels completely overwhelmed. And he is becoming aware of his emotional delay. Just a few weeks ago, at the grocery store, out of the blue he said, \u201cI think the reason that I still like stuffed animals and Lego is because in my heart I\u2019m like someone younger than myself.\u201d I tried not to cry at his brave, self-aware statement and told him that I think he\u2019s right, that his teachers and therapists have documented it over the years. I gently explained to him that at first they assessed him to have a six-year emotional delay, but somewhere along the way he gained a year, and so at age sixteen, he is like an eleven-year-old. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. I could see the wheels turning as he processed this.\n\nHere\u2019s Nigel at age eleven. How could I possibly expect this little boy to function as a high school sophomore? How could I think that the workload wouldn\u2019t overwhelm him? That even though he was intelligent enough to understand it, he couldn\u2019t handle the amount of it? Along with all of the social challenges and sensory issues he still battles on a constant basis? How could I think that the extensive support and assistance he receives both in and out of school would be enough? It\u2019s not just about his lack of executive functioning. It\u2019s about emotional maturity. How could I expect him to receive a regular diploma? That he would somehow figure it all out and navigate everything when he\u2019s emotionally an eleven-year-old? How?\nI\u2019ll tell you how: Dreams. My son taught himself to read at age 3 \u00bd, before he could even talk, and so I dared to dream. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 I\u2019m not throwing my dreams out the proverbial window just because he\u2019ll be getting a modified diploma, because I now accept that that\u2019s what he needs. I\u2019ll still have dreams for my son, but those dreams are now realistically calibrated. What\u2019s the problem with getting a modified diploma? It limits post-secondary educational opportunities, but with time and support perhaps in a few years we will be looking up online college degrees. And while I know that extended high school is a possibility for some students in similar situations, it\u2019s not a good option for Nigel. He\u2019s comfortable at his high school, but he doesn\u2019t want to be there any longer than necessary. He knows that option won\u2019t work for him, and I agree.\nNo sooner had I indicated my support for his need to get on the modified diploma plan than he stopped pulling out his hair. I told him that it wouldn\u2019t go into effect until everything had been written into his IEP at the upcoming meeting, and he understood. His relief, and his appreciation, was palpable. I had given him the autonomy to make a decision about his life and the respect and esteem that goes along with doing so. He knows himself. He knows what he needs. He always has.\n*\nFor every bit of Nigel\u2019s progress over the years, I am truly grateful, and I am so proud of my son. But in all honesty it was painful for me to write this post. To know that after everything we\u2019ve been through and all he\u2019s accomplished, this is the best we can do. Mostly, it was painful for me to let go of a dream. Oh, I can say that I\u2019ve \u201ccalibrated\u201d my dream, but in reality, I had to let it go. And that\u2019s okay. Because I\u2019ve learned that my dreams for him are not necessarily his dreams for himself. And the fact is, when I look ahead to his graduation two and a half years from now, the particulars of his diploma will be different, but nothing else will. Someone will still be videoing it, I\u2019ll still be crying, and I\u2019ll still feel all the things that I would have felt had he received a regular diploma. I\u2019m certain of that. And I\u2019m certain that Nigel\u2019s beautiful, serious face will still reflect the awareness of his accomplishments, and his determination for the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.accredited-online-college-degrees.com/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2011/01/04/commencement/", "title": "Commencement"},
{"date": "December 27, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t*\nThis particular week is my favorite time of year \u2013 the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day. I call it The \u2018Re\u2019 Week because I spend a lot of time doing things that start with \u2018re\u2019: review, reflect, and re-evaluate. (Those of us in the retail industry also know this week as the week of returns, but that\u2019s not what this post is about.)\nIf you\u2019re a friend or family member, or if you\u2019ve been reading this blog a while, you know that I\u2019m a very introverted person. I value time with the people in my life, of course, but I also value time alone, and as an introvert, I need it to recharge. Three times a week I take a fitness walk on a bike and pedestrian path that runs close to our little town, and true to my nature, I usually go alone. It\u2019s my processing time \u2013 45 minutes of pounding the pavement, pondering questions or issues about my life, all the while getting fresh air and a light endorphin rush. I need this time.\nOften while I\u2019m walking, cyclists or other pedestrians will pass by me on this\u00a0well-loved rural\u00a0path, and I smile and say hello. But one day about a month ago, I had gotten to my half-way turnaround point and realized that I hadn\u2019t seen anyone else out there. It seemed eerie to be the only one on that stretch of the path, even though I enjoyed the solitude. I turned around to head back, and about twenty minutes later I neared my starting point, still having seen no one. But then, about five yards from the end of my walk, I saw her. It was a large female wild turkey, walking on the dirt beside the asphalt path, headed in my direction. She was about three feet tall (or long) and stunningly beautiful. I literally gasped. I\u2019ve heard over the years that the turkey was close to being chosen as our national bird, and that we should be \u201cglad\u201d that the more majestic eagle won out. But let me tell you, as I slowed down in the presence of that amazing creature, all I could think was that the turkey is every bit as impressive as the eagle. I hear people call someone a \u201cturkey\u201d as a deprecating word, something a little gentler than \u201cfool\u201d or \u201cjerk.\u201d And now, having seen one and looked into her eyes, I\u2019ll never think of the word that way again.\nI slowed down, in awe, and watched her as she watched me. She kept slowly walking toward me, showing no fear. At first I thought perhaps she was injured, but she seemed to be walking fine, just slowly and purposefully. I swear she looked right into my eyes for a moment as we passed by each other. Then I turned my head and watched as she walked off into the brush.\nIntrigued by this encounter, when I got home I tried to find out the symbolism of turkeys, especially hens. I just couldn\u2019t get past the fact that there was no one else on the path that afternoon, and I truly believed that the turkey was some sort of sign for me. I found this great website and discovered that although the turkey (not surprisingly) is a symbol of abundance, it also symbolizes awareness, generosity, and sacrifice. The turkey is a sign of cycles, preparation, and new beginnings. To quote the site: \u201cWhen a turkey visits us it is a sign that we must be mindful of our blessings [and] a message to express our strength and brilliance\u2026and reveal our true selves.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s the perfect message for my annual \u201cre\u201d time. I\u2019ll be thinking of the turkey this week as I reflect and review, looking forward to a New Year of greater awareness and a few other things on that list (perhaps even abundance).\nHappy New Year, my friends! May it be filled with many blessings and special memories.\n*photo courtesy of Wikipedia\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.whats-your-sign.com/animal-symbolism-turkey.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/12/27/the-re-week/", "title": "The Re Week"},

{"date": "November 15, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tI was recently contacted by two different parties conducting surveys regarding our experiences\u00a0as the parents of children with autism, and I am happy to post the information about them. Why? Not just because those conducting the surveys would benefit from our experience, but because, in the long run,\u00a0other parents would benefit as well. Our experience matters to them. Letting our voices be heard matters. If you can, please join me in participating in the following surveys:\nMischelle Miller-Raftery, a doctoral student in psychology at California Southern University, is conducting a study on potential prenatal environmental triggers of autism.\u00a0 Ms. Raftery is looking to survey at least 50 mothers raising children who have been diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder (Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, autism, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified); and 20 mothers whose children have not been diagnosed.\u00a0This survey asks general questions about the mother\u2019s environment and lifestyle choices during pregnancy. The participant will be asked to fill in each question for the time period during their pregnancy with the child who was diagnosed with autism. The premise of this study is to look for trends between environmental exposures and autism. Specifically, this study explores multiple exposure combinations which might have occurred during your pregnancy. The goal of this study is to explore the possible environmental influences on autism.\nTo qualify for the study, the participant must meet the following criteria:\n\u2022 Their child must have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder including Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, autism, and pervasive developmental disorder- not otherwise specified.\n\u2022 Their baby must have been considered full-term (born after 37 weeks).\n\u2022 Their child must have no other developmental diagnosis.\n\u2022 Or, for the control group \u2013 Have a child over the age of three with no known diagnosis.\nParticipation in this study should take about 25 minutes to fill out the questionnaire. The link to the survey is: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/3YBPGBT, which is\u00a0open until January 15.\nThe other survey opportunity is being conducted by researchers at Columbia University\u2019s Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy.\u00a0They are currently collecting life stories from parents about our experiences in recognizing our child\u2019s autism, seeking professional help and navigating the available service systems. The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the road to diagnosis. We parents have different experiences and observations of our child\u2019s development, and\u00a0we have different personal resources with which\u00a0we access care and services.\u00a0We also differ in the type and extent of our support networks and social relations. And finally,\u00a0we make different decisions in our quest for obtaining the right diagnosis and care for our child.\u00a0\u00a0The researchers\u00a0would like to give parents the chance to tell our stories. Participation in the survey may help\u00a0them understand the heterogeneity of autism as well as how children develop over time.\nThe\u00a0life stories of parents of children who have autism are being collected through an online semi-structured survey at http://www.understandingautism.columbia.edu.\nThank you for your time and for\u00a0sharing your experiences.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/3YBPGBT", "http://www.understandingautism.columbia.edu"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/11/15/experience-matters/", "title": "Experience Matters"},

Each chapter includes \u201cSisterhood Tips\u201d pertaining to the topic and creative ways to approach every issue.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a practical, enjoyable book (for yourself or a friend) about starting the journey of having a child on the autism spectrum, be sure to check out The Autism Sisterhood.

{"date": "November 10, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nNigel, age sixteen, calmly noticing that there is only enough milk for one bowl of cereal: \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll just have toast this morning.\u201d\n*\nAt the age of six, after he had spent three years in an intensive ABA-based program, Nigel started Kindergarten in a contained (non-mainstreamed) classroom through STEPS, Specialized Training in Education Program Service. It was a two-year program, and he did so well after the first year that I made a huge mistake, one I still regret: I tried mainstreaming him before he was ready. The results were disastrous, and fortunately we were able to have him go back into the STEPS classroom after several agonizing weeks of the regular. He seamlessly returned to STEPS and finished out his second year, making even more developmental strides.\nAlmost ten years have passed, and I\u2019ve never forgotten the STEPS classroom and how beneficial it was for Nigel. But to be honest, usually it\u2019s the acronym that I think of on a regular basis. It\u2019s a reminder of the nature of development where autism is concerned \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s one step forward, two steps back. Sometimes it just seems to be a whole series of steps back. And sometimes there are those blessed days when it\u2019s one forward step after another.\nAside from some grouchiness due to Daylight Savings Time and some minor growling about having to do household chores, Nigel has, behaviorally and socially, been doing incredibly well. He still attends his social skills class every other week, and that helps a lot. But the fact is \u2013 he\u2019s self-regulating just as well as he did when he was on medication. It took some adjustment time, but these days, he continues to out-do himself.\nFor instance, when we were planning his recent birthday sleepover with two friends, he thought that it would be fun to carve pumpkins with them, and I thought it best to prepare him by mentioning that no one should be obligated to carve the pumpkins if they didn\u2019t want to. Nigel\u2019s calm response (in his typical flat voice): \u201cI most certainly recognize that.\u201d (!) Additionally, at this point he has nearly mastered the art of the Unprompted Thank You, less than a year after his first one. And one morning last week, as he was going out to the shed to get his bike to ride to school (a feat that, even after a year, I never take for granted), on his own he remembered his helmet when I kissed him goodbye and said, \u201cI love you. Ride safely.\u201d Usually I notice when he occasionally forgets his helmet. I don\u2019t know which shocked me more \u2013 that I didn\u2019t notice, or that when I said ride safely, he realized that he had forgotten his helmet and went to put it on. But that \u2013 amazing as it was \u2013 was nothing compared to the thing with the toast.\n*\nAidan, my creature of extreme habit, my fourteen-year-old limited eater, always has cereal and milk for breakfast. It\u2019s the only dairy he will consume. If we\u2019ve run out of milk on grocery day, he refuses to have anything else for breakfast, and I can\u2019t stand the thought of him going hungry. In the mornings, Nigel usually gets to the kitchen first to pour his own bowl of cereal and milk. Then Aidan staggers in and does the same thing. Once in a while, Nigel, on autopilot, uses up the last of the milk before Aidan gets out there. I\u2019m sure it was never a conscious decision on Nigel\u2019s part not to save any for Aidan. So, knowing that Nigel also likes toast for breakfast, I made a suggestion one morning when there had only been one serving of milk in the carton and Nigel had consumed it. \u00a0\u201cSince Aidan doesn\u2019t like toast, maybe in the future if you notice that there\u2019s only enough milk for one person, you could save it for him, and you could have toast.\u201d Nigel negligibly nodded; morning tends to be his least verbal time. I figured that, at best, he might remember to save the milk after I had reminded him at least twenty more times (and no, I\u2019m not exaggerating). I certainly didn\u2019t in my wildest dreams think that two weeks later, after my mentioning it only once to him, that on his own he would pour his bowl of cereal, go get the milk, notice by the carton\u2019s weight that it only had one serving left in it, and calmly, empathetically announce, \u201cI\u2019ll just have toast this morning,\u201d saving the milk for his brother.\nBut that\u2019s just what he did. He took another (big) step forward. And my heart swelled with emotion for my son, this wonderful soul who has never stopped trying.\nEd. note: Veterans Day has always been an important day to our family, and Nigel and I will be continuing his tradition again this year. If you hadn\u2019t read it last year (or would like to again), I\u2019d be honored if you would read my post about Nigel\u2019s tribute to veterans. It\u2019s one of my favorite stories about my son \u2013\u00a0and the veterans he looks up to.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/11/10/steps/", "title": "Steps"},

Good days, like what I wrote about in\u00a0a\u00a0recent\u00a0post, and bad days, like what I don\u2019t write about. I allude to Nigel\u2019s \u201cgrumpiness,\u201d which is blog-speak for blatant disrespectfulness; I say that he is doing well emotionally and behaviorally, and days later he is raging and crying about being irresponsible and worthless; I write about him being comfortable at his current school, yet his academic/executive functioning\u00a0skills are still lacking (putting it mildly), and I have no strength to deal with it now, after years of dealing with it alone. I need a vacation. We need a vacation.\nFortunately, several months ago we started planning a vacation for the week of Thanksgiving. My father, whom I have written about before, is an avid world traveler and wanted to take his two older grandsons on an international trip as their high school graduation gift from him. Not sure what direction his cancer battle would take (he is currently undergoing his third round of treatment), earlier this year Dad suggested that we accompany him on his annual Thanksgiving-in-Thailand trip now rather than wait for their graduations. And so, I am very excited to announce that early Friday morning we leave for a week in Thailand!\nThe boys are ecstatic about their first international trip \u2013 they have read and enjoyed National Geographic since Kindergarten and can\u2019t wait to get out and explore and experience (albeit briefly) another country. Grandpa has planned some amazing activities! And it will be so great to spend some time together. We can\u2019t wait!\nIn other news, I was recently honored with the Versatile Blogger Award \u2013 twice! I\u2019d like to thank both Stacey at The Four Cannons and Jazzy at Jazzygal for thinking of me! Jazzy noted that it would be perfect to post in my sidebar (the green!), and as soon as I have time to do some size\u00a0tweaking, I certainly will:\n\nInstructions for this award state that I should list seven interesting things about myself, but since I had done that for a previous award (and I can\u2019t come up with seven more at the moment!), I\u2019ve decided to do a variation \u2013\u00a0Seven of My Favorite Things:\n\nBook: The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon\nMovie: Best in Show\nColor: green\nFood: sushi\nAnimal: tiger\nCountry: Greece (so far!)\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m going to have to humbly bow out of tagging since\u00a0I have a huge list of things to do to get ready for the trip, including packing!

{"date": "September 8, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nOkay. I think we\u2019re ready now. The supplies have been purchased, the backpacks have been packed, the fees have been paid, the papers filled out. The anxiety has set in.\nYes, there\u2019s nothing like the start of a new school year to ramp up my stress level. I know \u2013\u00a0everybody\u2019s busy running around, getting the ducks in a row, the usual for those of us with kids in school. For me, it\u2019s not really about that. It\u2019s that year after year my PTSD kicks in every time the phone rings. And I\u2019m referring, of course, to the years and years of teachers and school administrators calling me at work to tell me that my son is having behavioral issues and I must leave work and come to get him. The phone rings and I instantly tense up. In recent years, with caller ID, the tensing doubles when I see \u201cschool district\u201d on the screen. God help me, it\u2019s a horrible feeling. It\u2019s an alarm, a pre-panic, a dread. And it used to happen on a regular basis, but especially at the beginning of the school year.\nToday, the first day of tenth grade (!), there were no calls. That doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be any later, I know better than that. But it\u2019s a good start, and I\u2019m grateful for it. Here\u2019s what else I\u2019m grateful for: a very positive IEP meeting last week. Some of you might recall how the last IEP meeting went, and how much I had prepared for it. I prepared for this one just as much because it was just as important. In fact, in some ways, this one was more important. The meeting in May was about getting the school district to agree that Nigel\u2019s academic needs, since he could not work independently, would be better met in a specialized setting. They didn\u2019t agree, but they didn\u2019t offer any alternatives.\nSo I came up with an alternative on my own. Over the summer, I researched various programs in public high schools with good special education departments. I thought, what are they doing that we could emulate? I printed out course descriptions from some of those schools that included specialized classes designed for students with autism to teach them the executive function skills they need to be able to work independently, which is exactly what Nigel needs. I also researched various books written for educators on how to teach executive function skills to students like Nigel, and I printed out descriptions of the books off of Amazon. I went to the IEP meeting, print-outs in hand, and proposed that the school create a weekly class on executive function skills for Nigel and any other students who would benefit from it (and of course there are other students who would, even if they do not have an ASD).\nAnd they said yes. They said yes not only to meeting my son\u2019s needs, but to setting the precedent for future ASD kids at that school (and, as we know, there will be more). They said yes to being an even better school. \u00a0They said yes to the other kids who really need some extra help with learning how to be a good student, autistic or not, but whose parents may not lobby as hard as I do. They said yes.\nAnd this mom is feeling a lot less anxiety, a lot less dread. In fact, I\u2019m feeling pretty excited about this school year.

Because the very next day, the second day of school, I had been sitting there at work for merely an hour when the phone rang, and when I saw \u201cschool\u201d pop up on the caller ID, I really couldn\u2019t believe it. Already? Aw, hell.\nUpon closer, split-second inspection, I discovered that it was coming from Aidan\u2019s school, and I relaxed a little. But only a little. Because when Aidan\u2019s school calls, it\u2019s usually because he\u2019s sick, and I still wind up having to leave work to go pick up a child from school. He seemed fine when he left the house an hour ago! I sighed and picked up the phone, resigned to my fate.\nBut the call wasn\u2019t about Aidan. It was the school district\u2019s main nurse, who happened to be at Aidan\u2019s school that day. And she was calling about Nigel and his seizure protocol. My heart started thudding as soon as she said it.\nSome of you may recall back in June when Nigel had his first major seizure. It was horrible and scary, as they all are, but when the smoke cleared and I had done some research, I was able to identify what might have triggered it, and thus learned how he could possibly avoid future episodes. Nigel stayed with his father for several weeks over the summer, and he made sure to refrain from watching movies in the dark, especially those with flashing lights. He is also learning to employ some stress-reduction techniques, since he was under a lot of cumulative stress at the time that the seizure occurred, and that most likely made him susceptible to it. And (as I make sure to knock on my wooden desk), the great news is that he has not experienced any more seizure activity at this point (that we know of).\nBut because he had that seizure, the school district requires there to be a seizure protocol on file in case he has a seizure at school. And I\u2019m glad that they require it, of course. It\u2019s a signed document that his teachers must be aware of in the event that he has a seizure in their classroom, so that they know what to do. It\u2019s necessary, it\u2019s important, but it\u2019s unwelcome. Of course, I\u2019m glad that there is a seizure protocol in place, and I approve it, but I wish it didn\u2019t have to exist. I wish my son hadn\u2019t had a seizure. I wish I didn\u2019t have to worry every day about him riding his bike to and from school and having a seizure on his bike. It\u2019s hard enough already. Everything he deals with is hard enough. And now this.\nLike it or not, this is our reality. This is the \u201cwhat now?\u201d mentioned in the heading of this website. This is the latest thorn that has found its way to my side. One more worry in a long chain of fears. And I will just have to face it, like I do everything else. The seizure protocol came home today for me to sign, and we have an appointment next week with his doctor to see if she wants to schedule any more tests. If she does, we\u2019ll do\u00a0them, of course. But part of me wishes I could just bury my head in the sand. And all of me wishes that knocking on wood would be enough to keep the electrical activity at bay forever.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/09/15/protocol/", "title": "Protocol"},
{"date": "September 2, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tI\u2019ve been getting a lot of \u201cHow are you?\u201ds lately from friends and family. It\u2019s sort of like when I was going through my separation twelve years ago \u2013 the same concern is there, the wishing they could help, the commiserating over things not going according to plan. I had hoped to share some of the school year custody with Nigel and Aidan\u2019s dad by moving to where he lives, and that, as most of you know, didn\u2019t happen. At this point, the bottom line is nothing new. I\u2019ve been doing this (full-time single parenting) for nine years, and I guess I can just keep doing it. But I will tell you this \u2013 it doesn\u2019t get easier. The boys don\u2019t get up much during the night now of course, but the days. Oh, man, the too-full days just about kill me. The strain just builds and builds. By now I feel like I\u2019ve got a piano on my back.\nFor most of this year (and some of last), I had been searching for a life coach, just wanting help in figuring out how to approach my life so that I would feel less overwhelmed. I\u2019d read about various life coaches on friends\u2019 blogs and would come across a few online, but none of them felt right for me. One day a few months ago, Eithne left a comment on one of my posts. She linked to her website, and as soon as I clicked over, I knew that she was the one.\u00a0 Through her excellent coaching I am learning to prioritize my life according to what I value, and I definitely feel that I now have the tools to enable myself to feel less overwhelmed. To anyone looking for a life coach, I highly recommend her!\nLast, but certainly not least, I recently received a lovely new (or new to me) blog award:\n\nIsn\u2019t it cool? I love the design. And I also love the cool blog from whence it came: Big Daddy Autism. Thanks, Big Daddy! If you haven\u2019t checked him out yet, head on over there for some much-needed humor and some thought-provoking posts.\nApparently in accepting this award, I must reveal seven things about myself. So I\u2019ll follow Big Daddy\u2019s example and mention the following:\n1) I have two tattoos, a tiger and a Celtic knot. The tiger has been on my arm for ten years, and it\u2019s really beautiful. During the summer I receive many compliments on both of them.\n2) I have written and published a novel, and I\u2019m (slowly) working on my next one.\n3) My eyes are green with gold flecks in them. \u00a0Sometimes they appear to be hazel.\n4) I have driven the same car for over ten years, and it feels like an extension of myself. I love it like I would a horse.\n5) My favorite hobby is winetasting. So much so that I wanted to put a bocce court in my backyard because it\u2019s the only sport you can play and not have to put down your wine glass.\n6) I have sustained three major injuries from one of my other hobbies \u2013 snowboarding. I can assure you that no wine was involved, although it certainly was afterward.\n7) I drink green smoothies every morning for breakfast. A green smoothie in the morning and a glass of wine at night \u2013 it\u2019s all about balance!\nThere you have it. I\u2019d do the tagging thing, but I have a big IEP meeting tomorrow morning (more on that next week), and must use the rest of my evening to prepare. You know how it is.\nCheers, everyone!\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.trueessencecoaching.net/", "http://bigdaddyautism.com/", "http://bigdaddyautism.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Slip-Tanya-Savko/dp/0981786804/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1283493467&sr=1-1", "http://www.rawfamily.com/green-smoothie"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/09/02/the-lowdown-vol-5/", "title": "The Lowdown, Vol. 5"},
{"date": "September 19, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t[This post was originally published at Hopeful Parents]\nOnce upon a time there was a little boy who had autism. He did not start talking until he was five years old, and he often screamed and butted his head into people and walls to indicate his frustration. He also had agonizing sensory issues that made it impossible for him to filter loud noises, and he would scream and bolt whenever someone turned on a mechanical device in his presence. He would be disturbed by leaf blowers more than a block away, and the vacuum cleaner in the house was such an assault on his hearing that he would fly into a panic if anyone so much as walked in front of the closet in which it was kept. His parents would try to \u201csweep\u201d the carpet as often as possible to avoid using the vacuum cleaner. When they absolutely needed to use it, one parent would take the little boy outside and comfort him while the other parent vacuumed.\nAfter some time, the little boy\u2019s parents divorced, and the mother would vacuum whenever he was visiting his father\u2019s house. This went on for a few years, and then the father moved farther away, and the little boy could not visit him weekly. By this time the little boy had started learning to talk, and when it was time to vacuum, the mother would take him to his bedroom, show him how to cover his ears with a pillow, and shut his door while she quickly vacuumed. \nIt went on like that for several years. The mother would always notify her son before she would turn on the vacuum cleaner (as well as the blender, the food processor, and any other mechanical device in their home). The boy\u2019s sensitive hearing still kept him most anxious about the vacuuming, and as his verbal skills increased, he would head to his room and admonish his mother, \u201cDon\u2019t start until my door is shut!\u201d and call out \u201cIs it over?\u201d when the vacuum cleaner had stopped. By the time he was a teenager, the boy told his mother, \u201cThat vacuum is like shrieking banshees in my ear.\u201d She thought it would always be that way, and sadly she wondered what other sounds in the world still tormented her son. He had gotten to a point where he could go to a movie theater if he wore ear plugs, but the vacuum cleaner still plagued him. \nThen one day, after being in a series of situations involving loud noises and noting that her son was affected by them far less than he used to be, the mother decided to try something. She approached her son and mentioned that it seemed that his hearing wasn\u2019t as sensitive as it used to be, and he said, matter-of-factly, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve just learned to deal with it.\u201d She pointed out that he could now mow the lawn while wearing ear plugs, and she asked if he would be willing to try that with vacuuming. \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d he said in his typically flat voice. \nThe mother gave him a brief tutorial on the vacuum cleaner, and, armed with his trusty ear plugs, the boy began to vacuum his bedroom while the mother went to work on something in another room. Amazed that he agreed to do it in the first place, she figured that he would do a quick job and shut the vacuum cleaner off as soon as possible. So when four minutes had gone by and the vacuum cleaner was still running in his room, she went back to check on things. She discovered that her son had put an attachment on the vacuum nozzle and was methodically detailing the corners of his room. She stood there, marveling at this unexpected turn of events. And then, with the ear plugs still firmly planted in his ears, her son looked up at her and smiled. The shrieking banshees no longer consumed him.\nAfter the mother picked herself up off the floor, she praised him for taking the initiative and doing the extra work in the corners. She asked him how it went for him \u2013 vacuuming! \u2013 and he said in his flat but beautiful voice, \u201cIt was fine.\u201d And even though it was a small thing, inconsequential in the grand scheme of things, the mother crossed \u201cvacuum\u201d off her mental list of things that her son, now almost sixteen, would \u201cnever\u201d do and reminded herself that anything is possible. Anything.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/09/19/the-boy-and-the-vacuum-cleaner/", "title": "The Boy and the Vacuum Cleaner"},

I am periodically contacted by various companies or organizations for product reviews or links to sites or requests to post videos, and I am happy to accommodate whenever I can. I try to post them on a quarterly basis, and since I haven\u2019t since spring, I\u2019ve got a few I\u2019d like to mention.\nUnfortunately I\u2019m not able to do every product review that I\u2019m contacted about, but I really wanted to do this one because I love pears, and I feel strongly about the importance of organic foods in our diet. GoGo Juice is ripe, peeled, organic pear juice, pure and simple. I received my sample with instructions to dilute it with 40% water, which I did. Since Nigel does not drink much juice, Aidan and I tasted it. I found it to be light and lovely, but Aidan felt it was a little too light. He preferred a 25-30% dilution. At any rate, it\u2019s a really healthy, tasty juice that I feel good about having in our home. And not only that, GoGo Juice supports autism awareness! They will donate $1 to the Autism Society of America for every new Facebook fan until the end of September! Click here to go to their Facebook page.\n\nUp next, I received a notice about a program by CVS Caremark called All Kids Can, a five-year, $25 million commitment aimed at making life easier for children with disabilities. They have launched a Facebook page that serves as a community for families, teachers, and experts alike to share stories, pictures, or articles and have conversations related to helping children of all abilities to learn, play, and succeed in life. They\u2019ll also be posting articles from experts, news, and videos on the latest innovations benefiting kids of all shapes, sizes and abilities. See the website for more information about the program: http://www.cvscaremarkallkidscan.com/\nLastly, I would like to draw your attention to the Teen Autism Social Groups page. I started it two years ago, and since that time there have been several postings, including one in Australia! Take a look and see if there are any near you. If not, many of them can be contacted by email, and you can connect that way. As we bloggers know, there is great support to be had across the Internet ether.

{"date": "August 19, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tWhen you have a special-needs child, there are plenty of things that you wonder if your child will ever be able to do. So when they actually happen \u2013 when you hear your five-year-old say I love you, even though it\u2019s echolalic, or when your child sleeps in their own bed, or doesn\u2019t wet it, or when he holds a pencil for the first time, or pets a dog \u2013 we note the occasion with much fanfare, and rightfully so. We know the effort involved in making those things happen, how long we waited, how much we hoped. They are nothing less than miracles.\nBut milestones don\u2019t happen every day, of course. If they start happening every day, they\u2019re no longer milestones. They become part of our daily life, the status quo. They are the everyday. And sometimes I find\u00a0as much\u00a0hope in the everyday\u00a0as I do\u00a0in the milestones. Why? Because we can\u2019t live from milestone to milestone. We live from day to day. \nMy son was diagnosed with autism at the age of three and did not start talking until he was five. In 1997, we didn\u2019t know for sure if he could learn to talk. And so when he slowly got started \u2013 first with various stages of echolalia, then, when he was using more spontaneous speech, learning pronouns, articles, tenses, and syntax \u2013 I was overjoyed. It didn\u2019t matter to me that his voice was always flat, usually expressionless. I figured it would always be that way, and I loved it. I never even hoped that he would develop voice inflection because I was just glad to hear his voice in the first place. \nTwo years ago, our regional autism consultant created a weekly social skills class for my son to attend at his school, so that he could learn to communicate more appropriately with his peers. The object of the class was to instill conversation skills and teach socially appropriate behavior as well as how to interpret gestures and non-verbal communication. But something unexpected happened, and I can only attribute it to the social skills class. About three months after he started the class, I began noticing that he was using voice inflection. And he was doing it appropriately, not just random variations. He was putting emphasis on the right words and his tone was no longer as flat. And he\u2019s been doing that for almost two years now. The boy who, for so many years, could only parrot lines from Disney movies or Scooby-Doo cartoons when he wanted to interact with people is now regularly conversing with voice inflection. \u00a0That is my everyday. And that is what gives me hope.\nIt\u2019s true, the milestones sustain us. They are remarkable, miraculous, and worth every bit of celebrating. But when you sit down and stop to think about it, when you realize, hey, we\u2019ve been using the PECS cards for three months now and my child rarely shrieks at home anymore, thank God, that is your everyday. That is where hope lives. \nI\u2019ve had many different everyday realizations over the years. In fact, that one about the PECS cards was one of them, over twelve years ago. Then I had another one a few years later when I realized that we were no longer using the PECS cards. There have been many other everyday realizations, equally hopeful. But now, my son is speaking with voice inflection, an unexpected gift, and that is my everyday.

I remember a few summers ago when I was lamenting to an acquaintance of mine (who did not have children) about how much I missed them. He said, \u201cIf you miss them so much now, how are you going to manage when they go to college?!\u201d I bristled and tried to be diplomatic when I pointed out that they\u2019re supposed to go to college when they finish high school, not preschool, as Aidan had the first summer he spent away from me. Leaving home is \u201csupposed\u201d to happen when they\u2019re eighteen or nineteen, not when they\u2019re five. It\u2019s not supposed to be like this, I would moan every summer. They\u2019re so little! They\u2019re supposed to be with me now. But that\u2019s not how it happened for us. I\u2019ve had to get used to not seeing my children for several weeks at a time, since they were very young. Sometimes it\u2019s been outright surreal, year after year. I would liken it to how it might be if I were in the military, but I have no experience in that area, so that\u2019s merely speculation. I do know that these last nine summers have been yet another lesson for me in letting go, in trusting, and in being open to something outside the typical parenting experience.\nIn any case, we are now in the midst of the end-of-summer shuffle: the filling out of registration papers and standing in line to turn them in and pay fees, the scheduling of IEP meetings, the inventorying of past school supplies and the shopping for what\u2019s needed, the getting back in touch with friends, therapists, and teachers to let them know what happened, or rather what didn\u2019t. But it\u2019s good to have them home. It\u2019s good to know that they\u2019ll be comfortable when they start school in less than two weeks. It\u2019s good to have things settled. It\u2019s all good.\nAnd for the record, I\u2019m still going to miss them when they go away to college. But oh, when and if that day comes, I will be one proud mom.\nOf course, I already am.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/08/26/home-again-2/", "title": "Home Again\u2026"},
{"date": "September 29, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tNigel (in the car on the way to the video store): \u00a0What does \u2018mainstream\u2019 mean?\nI should have known it was coming at some point. But I didn\u2019t. And I felt like a deer in the headlights.\nIt\u2019s a simple enough word, perplexingly defined by Webster as \u201cthe predominant current or tendency of a movement, discipline, etc.\u201d But it\u2019s the secondary definition that we special-needs parents know all too well: \u201cv.t. put (handicapped students) in regular classes.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s printed in my desk dictionary, complete with the parenthesis. And I cringed when I checked it later, wondering if Nigel had heard or read something similar, causing him to ask. Wanting to hear it from me. Wanting to see what it meant to me, perhaps. Wanting to know what it meant for him. It\u2019s something that we special-needs parents mention at IEP meetings and in blog posts and annual Christmas letters (well I do, anyway): Our hopes of mainstreaming. Our relief and pride when it happens successfully. Our sadness and frustration when it does not. I am unfortunately too familiar with the highs and lows of mainstreaming. Sometimes I think we give that word too much power.\nBack to the car. Back to me wondering what to say in the second after he posed his question. I figured I\u2019d keep it general, didn\u2019t want to get too heavy. After all, we were going to the video store. The possibility hit me that perhaps he had read the word in the context of movies. So I tentatively forged ahead and said, \u201cUm\u2026mostly it means \u2018typical.\u2019 Like with movies and books \u2013 what most people are watching and reading. It\u2019s the usual stuff.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, his way of indicating that he understands something. A few minutes later we arrived at the store, and the conversation didn\u2019t continue.\nBut the box had been opened, and I couldn\u2019t just close it back up. We needed to discuss what was inside. He\u2019s a sophomore in high school (!), he has started attending his own IEP meetings, and he should know. He should hear it from me. So a few days later (processing time for both of us), I went to talk to him in his room one evening, when I knew he would be relaxed, and I broached the subject. I asked him if he remembered asking me what \u2018mainstream\u2019 meant, and where he had heard or read it mentioned before. He confirmed that his question was in regard to movies, and then I told him that there was another meaning of the word that I wanted him to be aware of because he might hear it at his IEP meetings or read about it somewhere. I told him that when students have autism or other differences that affect their learning, \u201cmainsteaming\u201d them means that they are taught in the same classroom with other students, but that they often have aides for assistance. I briefly told him of his own mainstreaming history. I told him that some students have difficulty being mainstreamed and are taught in smaller classrooms or homeschooled, and that they are just as important, just as intelligent. They just have different educational needs. I told him that mainstreaming isn\u2019t best for everyone. That sometimes it wasn\u2019t working for him either, and that was okay. We just had to find something that worked for him. And we did, whether it was full-time homeschooling or part-time mainstreaming. It was all okay.\nAnd gradually, over the years, that powerful word lost its influential quality.\nMainstreaming is not about the right way or the wrong way, superior if you are or inferior if you aren\u2019t. It\u2019s not the Holy Grail of education, as I mistakenly believed in years past. I remember the Christmas letter I wrote ten years ago, how I unwittingly glorified mainstreaming by crowing about how Nigel, age five, was finally starting to talk, and I wrote, \u201cWe hope to have Nigel mainstreamed for Kindergarten next year.\u201d In fact, he wasn\u2019t mainstreamed until second grade, and that was difficult at best, even with a full-time one-on-one aide. He wasn\u2019t mainstreamed for most of middle school either. And here\u2019s the thing \u2013 he\u2019s a better person for it. He has not had a typical education, but he has had a well-rounded one. He has learned just as much, if not more,\u00a0and he is happy. And I am just as proud of that.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/09/29/mainstream/", "title": "Mainstream"},
{"date": "June 6, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve moved out of state. And it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve had to downsize either. But something about this time is so daunting that I haven\u2019t even begun to pack. The boys are leaving in less than two weeks to\u00a0be with their dad in Los Angeles, and I\u2019m leaving in less than two months to move to Not-Sure-Yet. Now that Nigel won\u2019t be able to go to the special school we wanted him to attend (at least not in the foreseeable future), I have to get to L.A. sooner than originally planned so that I can get him set up at his new school, which is called Not-Sure-Yet High. At least we have it narrowed down to a couple, and the one we choose will of course determine where I get an apartment. Yes, that\u2019s right \u2013 apartment. I haven\u2019t lived in an apartment for ten years. The boys were much smaller then and had fewer things! And I\u2019m downsizing a four-bedroom house into a two-bedroom apartment. That should be fun. Time for creative packing! Ever played the \u201cI don\u2019t know, honey, it must have gotten lost in the move\u201d game? And no, the house hasn\u2019t sold yet. This \u2013 this planning and packing and changing our lives \u2013 is truly an exercise in belief. \u00a0\nSo, due to our impending move, for the past few weeks the boys and I have been the\u00a0honored recipients of various invitations for get-togethers, barbeques, and goodbye parties. Last month, we had lunch with my 92-year-old grandmother, the boys\u2019 only living great-grandparent. Last weekend, we went with my mom, sister and brother-in-law, and my little nephew to our spot on the coast where we\u2019ve been going every year for nine years. It\u2019s been bittersweet, of course. On the one hand, I am excited to get going, to get a move on (ha! So that\u2019s where he gets it!) and finish the process I\u2019d begun six months ago, when we were fogged in all day at our local airport and I said, That\u2019s it! I\u2019m done! This was also after an extremely cold December, complete with daytime temperatures in single digits, which I\u2019d never experienced in my twenty years of living in southern Oregon. But it wasn\u2019t just the weather, of course. It was a combination of factors, all of which carried far more weight than the weather. And it\u2019s time for those factors to change. On the other hand, it\u2019s so hard to leave our life here behind, and the people in it.\nLast night, the boys had their long-time friends over for one last sleepover. I bought two huge pizzas, soda, ice cream, chips, and stuff for homemade waffles in the morning. The boys walked through my front door, all of them now much taller than I am, greeted me in their deep voices, and loped out to our game room, where we\u2019ve had sleepovers for the past seven years. I have watched these little boys become young men!! \u00a0(Okay, must not cry on the keyboard now.) And such wonderful young men they are. These friends of Nigel\u2019s have stuck by him through unnerving meltdowns and endless movie echolalia. They were there for him when I had to homeschool him and they were there for him when he returned to regular school. They have given him the gift that every person needs and deserves \u2013 friendship. Words cannot express my gratitude. I love these boys.\nThere are more goodbye parties to come \u2013 Tuesday at Boy Scouts and next week at Nigel\u2019s special education classroom. Nigel\u2019s Scoutmaster, who\u2019s known him for over six years, has more patience than anyone I\u2019ve ever met, and Nigel\u2019s special education teacher has put forth every effort to meet his needs, just in the nine months that she\u2019s known him. The facilitator of his social skills class, who has known him since his non-verbal days, actually created the class two years ago just for him. Just for my son, because that\u2019s what he needed. And there are so many others. I sit here tallying up all the people who have touched our lives, who have shown so much kindness to us, even those online whom we have not yet met. It overwhelms me, this downpour of love. We have been truly blessed.\nThe best part is that, in thinking of all the wonderful friends and family members we will miss, I have been reminded of what\u2019s really important. It\u2019s the people in our lives. It\u2019s not where I\u2019ll live, where I\u2019ll work, where my kids will go to school, and making sure that everything is planned, that we know where every step takes us.\u00a0 The Not-Sure-Yets will become certainties soon enough. The packing will get done when needed. Somehow it all works out. What really matters is how we love, and how we are loved. We will go forward into our new environment surrounded by the warmth of those who have cared for us, and will continue to from across the miles. And I\u2019m certain that their warmth \u2013 their love \u2013 will see us through.\n\nChristmas \u201908: my sister (and nephew on-the-way!), brother-in-law, Nigel, me, my grandmother, my two aunts, and my mom.

{"date": "June 9, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nWell, I finally read it \u2013 Cowboy & Wills. I\u2019d put it off long enough. Not because I didn\u2019t want to read it, but because I knew it would hit close to home. And some of that stuff is hard to relive. By \u201cstuff,\u201d I mean the younger years \u2013 when you can\u2019t leave the house because your child\u2019s sensory issues are so severe. The overwhelming years of constantly going to therapy and doctor appointments and special education team meetings. The difficulty of dealing with ignorant people. It was all there. But there was more \u201cstuff\u201d there that I hadn\u2019t even realized.\nCowboy & Wills, by Monica Holloway, is the touching memoir of a boy with autism and his dog. When Holloway\u2019s son, Wills, is diagnosed with autism, she finds comfort by acquiring various pets \u2013 fish, hamsters, hermit crabs, a turtle, a rabbit. I laughed aloud reading her descriptions of their antics! Before long, Wills indicates his desire for a dog, and Holloway starts researching. Cowboy makes her appearance, and the miracles start happening. Wills begins sleeping in his own bed (with Cowboy), becomes more comfortable and sociable at school and with new people, starts swimming in the backyard pool, and even says his first \u201cI love you.\u201d All because of Cowboy. It\u2019s a book that\u2019s both sweet and funny, sad and happy, and all about love and hope.\nBut for me, it was more than just a good read. It struck a chord with me in a way that I never expected. In a scene when Holloway is taking her son to his first OT appointment, out of the blue he asks her, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d He asks it in the same way and at the same age that my son asked me the exact same question. It threw me back to that heartbreaking moment, back to being shocked that he could formulate the words to ask and trying in a split second to figure out how to answer him. But it was also the moment of my calling \u2013 when I first decided that I would write about autism. It was good to be reminded of that.\nI cried at the ending, of course, but at some point I realized that I was also crying about something else. It finally dawned on me that I never acknowledged my feelings and my fears all those years ago when my own son was diagnosed. I just accepted it and got down to the business and busyness of pursuing his therapies and just getting through the day. I suppose it was mainly because I also had a\u00a0second child with special needs and didn\u2019t have the time or energy to pay attention to my own emotions. It\u2019s amazing how you can shove those things down for so long and then they just surface at unexpected times, sometimes years later. \u00a0It was definitely something I needed, without even realizing it. A lovely story and on-the-fly therapy \u2013 together in one good book!\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Cowboy-Wills-Story-Monica-Holloway/dp/1416595031/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1254765846&sr=1-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Cowboy-Wills-Story-Monica-Holloway/dp/1416595031/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1254765846&sr=1-1"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/06/09/cowboy-wills-a-review/", "title": "Cowboy & Wills: A Review"},

{"date": "June 20, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tI feel honored to have my monthly post here [at Hopeful Parents]\u00a0fall on Father\u2019s Day! I would love to take this opportunity to share a little bit about my dad, and why he inspires such hope in me.\nMy father\u2019s parents emigrated from Czechoslovakia in the 1920s and settled in New York. A few decades later, the desire for new surroundings struck again and they drove across the continent to live in Los Angeles. My father was twelve years old at the time, and the experience must have ignited in him a passion for travel. So strong is it at this point that I don\u2019t even know how many countries he has visited, but I think it\u2019s over forty. And he has set foot on every continent except Antarctica. \nIt\u2019s quite likely that he might have had time to travel to even more countries, but on many trips he likes to return to places that he\u2019s already been, and loves. He\u2019s been to Greece at least a dozen times. Same with Thailand. And there are several other countries he\u2019s returned to more than once, just because he liked it there and wanted to go back \u2013 or maybe he missed something the first time around. Or he wanted to return to certain countries to share the experience with any of his four children. Whatever the reason, he is a seasoned world traveler who enjoys planning his trips as much as he enjoys taking them. It\u2019s what he lives for.\nJust over two years ago, my dad was diagnosed with colon cancer. Surgery was rapidly scheduled to remove the large tumor that had been growing for several years. Dad pulled through and started chemotherapy. The oncologist said that it looked like he got it all, and Dad felt tired but good. He flew to Peru and climbed Macchu Pichu, and then visited some out-of-state family members. We all felt confident that the cancer was gone. But about a year later, it returned, and this time it had spread to a lymph node outside the colon, so Dad\u2019s doctor placed him between stages III and IV. It was worse than the first time, and we were scared. He had surgery again, and this time, the surgeon accidentally cut his ureter. A stent had to be placed on the ureter for several weeks, causing considerable pain, in addition to the usual post-op discomfort. All the while, Dad kept a very positive and hopeful outlook and continued to plan his trips. \nBut he worried us, saying things like he wanted to take his teenage grandsons to Thailand now rather than when they graduated, since he wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he\u2019d be around. I told him he couldn\u2019t think like that. Dad soon started his second round of chemotherapy, more aggressive this time (twice monthly IV treatments plus daily pills), which caused significant fatigue and cold sensitivity. Finally, when the treatments were over, Dad\u2019s bloodwork showed that the cancer indicators had dropped. Feeling relieved and optimistic but not wanting another repeat, Dad decided to become proactive. He researched types of alternative cancer treatment and prevention and dramatically changed his diet to bolster his immune system post-chemo. He started drinking daily green smoothies and taking various supplements, determined to retain his health, to do everything possible to keep the cancer at bay. \nAnd so far, so good. His latest tests taken just one month ago look promising. He continues to make his health a priority and maintain his positive outlook. I can\u2019t put into words how inspired I am by his hopefulness throughout this whole experience. And I am hopeful too. I\u2019m hopeful that this time he\u2019s beat it, that he\u2019s going to be around for much longer than he\u2019d thought last year. No, Dad\u2019s not going anywhere soon. \nExcept Thailand, of course. And Greece. Or maybe Peru again . . .\nWishing everyone a very Happy Father\u2019s Day!\n**UPDATE** It is with deepest sorrow that I must write that my father did indeed lose his battle with cancer, less than a year after this post was written. He was\u00a067. I wrote a post at my author site about caring for him in his last days: What My Father Taught Me.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://tanyasavko.com/2011/06/19/what-my-father-taught-me/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/06/20/the-second-time-around/", "title": "The Second Time Around"},
{"date": "June 13, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tIt seemed like it came from out of nowhere, and in some ways, it did. But lately I\u2019d been noticing ambulances around town, even those without\u00a0their sirens and lights on. And three weeks ago I commented on my friend Elizabeth\u2019s beautiful post that the only child I\u2019d witnessed having a seizure was not my own.\nA few days ago, Nigel had his first tonic-clonic (formerly grand mal) seizure. He had been on the couch in the living room watching a movie, and I was reading in my office. I started to hear a repetitive banging noise coming from the living room, and I yelled out, \u201cStop the banging!\u201d When it did not stop, I marched out to the living room. \u201cI said to stop the banging! What are you doing?!\u201d I yelled again, looking at Nigel, whose body was half-off the couch with his legs stuck under the heavy coffee table, banging it. I thought perhaps he was acting out a scene from the movie or laughing in an exaggerated way, but that was before I saw his face. I pulled back the blanket that had been covering him, and then all at once it hit me. The violent convulsing, the profuse frothing at the mouth, the eyes rolling back in his head: He was having a seizure.\nI was terrified. My legs started shaking as hard as Nigel\u2019s. I pulled them out from under the coffee table and placed them on the couch and shoved the blanket out of the way. With dread I realized that he was having great difficulty breathing and yelled out to Aidan to call 911 and bring me the phone. The dispatcher kept me calm while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Nigel\u2019s breathing alarmed me, but after the convulsions stopped, it seemed to come a little easier, although it was still ragged and rapid. The EMTs arrived, checked him out, and tried to insert an IV (which he fought off, even in his semi-conscious state). \u00a0Then they placed him on a gurney and wheeled him out to the ambulance.\nI rode in the back with Nigel and Aidan rode up front. The EMT in the back asked Nigel questions and he answered them.\u00a0 Later he would tell me that he had no memory of the ambulance ride or the first two hours in the hospital, even though he was conscious and speaking. I sat there behind my son as he spelled his name in the ambulance, berating myself for yelling about the banging when he was having a seizure. Of course, there would have to be some element of the experience for which I would feel guilt. How long had the seizure gone on before his legs got stuck under the table? Why was my first inclination to yell about it?\nThree hours later, everything checked out clean at the hospital (the brilliant ER doctor said that because the CT scan was clear, he might not have had a seizure. Um, yeah, he really did. Guess you had to be there, eh, doc?), and after waiting almost an hour post-discharge for a cab, we arrived home past 2:00 AM. I put the boys to bed and tried for at least an hour to fall asleep, but each time I heard a noise (usually because of the cats), I jumped out of bed and went to check on Nigel. \u00a0My mind kept fixating on questions I had about seizures and how they would affect Nigel\u2019s life. What does this mean for his future? What if he has one while riding his bike? Or in the shower? Where do we go from here?\nI woke up exhausted and called the doctor\u2019s office. His regular doctor was not in, so we saw another doctor in the practice who recommended a referral for an EEG and MRI. But, with Nigel moving to L.A. next week, there\u2019s no point in receiving a referral here. We\u2019re on our own to find one there as quickly as possible.\nExcept we\u2019re not on our own. We\u2019re part of this amazing and wonderful online community of families with special needs. So I contacted Elizabeth. And not only did she answer my questions and recommend her daughter\u2019s specialist, she calmed my fears and provided empathy. And I am so grateful. I couldn\u2019t help but remember a post I had written over two years ago about my fear that Nigel might develop seizures in his teens. It was only the third post I had written, so it didn\u2019t receive any comments, but in it, I had asked for other parents\u2019 experience and advice about seizures. And now, right when I need it most, I have it. We are truly blessed to be a part of this community. \u00a0\nI still have many questions, most of which we won\u2019t know the answers to until the testing is done, and even then, the results may be inconclusive. I still have a lot of anxiety. My legs are still sore from being so tense during the whole experience that night. I still have fears, but I\u2019m trying not to focus on them. I\u2019m trying to focus on the good and move forward, knowing that we\u2019re not on our own.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2010/5/21/winging-it.html", "http://elizabethaquino.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/06/13/out-of-nowhere/", "title": "Out of Nowhere"},
{"date": "June 30, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tSometimes you\u2019ve just got to get outta Dodge. And with the boys happily in L.A. for some time with their dad, that\u2019s just what I did. I took a drive up to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, jogged over to Rainier National Park (well, not literally), and then visited some friends in Portland on my way there and back. It was a great trip \u2013 a little retreat for myself. But when you take a trip alone, you often end up with some pictures that look like this:\n\nAnd if you\u2019re used to going to National Parks with your kids, you\u2019re going to really miss them when you drive around one all day, and then again that night when you\u2019re in the motel room by yourself. And since you were really looking forward to some time to yourself, it takes you by surprise that you\u2019d rather have them with you instead. But then when you stop to think about it, you\u2019re not that surprised at all. And you\u2019re wishing that they were in this picture, standing on the bridge:\n\nThe rainforests are beautiful \u2013 lots of moss and ferns and old trees with pretty creeks gurgling by. Lush greenery and gorgeous wildflowers line every road, even the highways. This is what the Pacific Northwest is known for.\n\u00a0\n\n\nNext I headed over to the coast. Not being a reader of the books, I unwittingly found myself in Twilight territory. There is a rather large store in Forks, Washington, called Dazzled by Twilight, which I happened to drive by. I glanced at the life-size cardboard cut-outs of the characters lining the sidewalk, smiling as I thought of my sons and their disinterest. (Well, Nigel has disinterest. Aidan has disdain.) Closer to the coast, I saw \u201cWelcome, Twilight Fans!\u201d signs posted on little motels I passed and another souvenir shop devoted to the series. In fact, the photo below was taken a few yards away from the official \u201cTwilight Tours\u201d bus, which a young couple was waiting to board.\n\nThe next day, I drove to Mt. Rainier National Park, and at first I had no idea how lucky I was that it was a clear day. I later learned that the majestic mountain is often cloaked in clouds. As I rounded nearly every bend in the road I had to pull over to take a photo, gasping at this fourteener\u2018s beauty. This picture really doesn\u2019t do it justice.\n\nAfter my cozy night\u2019s stay at the lodge, I decided to stop at one last waterfall on my way out. Fortunately, there were others there at the same time, and I asked someone to take a photo:\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more for this Lowdown post! Months ago, my friend Jazzygal bestowed the Happy 101 award on me, and I\u2019m finally listing the 10 Things that Make Me Happy. It\u2019s something I always need to be reminded of, but I\u2019m really needing it now, so thanks again, Jazzy!\n\n\nspending time with Nigel and Aidan \u2013 watching movies together at home, reading, playing games\nwriting novels\nenjoying meals with friends\nreading an amazing novel\nsleeping in\nblogging\nwinetasting\ntraveling\nsavoring a piece of chocolate\nbeing home when the boys are, but doing my own thing and just hearing their voices, happy doing their own things \u2013 Aidan on his X-Box Live and Nigel scripting the movie he\u2019s watching \u2013 makes me so happy.\n\nThere you have it. I\u2019m going to opt-out on the tagging this time, but if anyone feels like leaving a comment listing the things that make them happy, all the better!

{"date": "July 6, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tI had this great idea many years ago. At the end of every school year, I would write a review of how that year was for my two sons, a separate entry for each, describing not only their progress but also their personality, their likes and dislikes, and things they said or did. As a writer, I figured that was the least I could do.\nSo, that idea lasted about two years. Life sort of got in the way, along with other writing endeavors. I had always meant to pick it back up again but never did. Then I started blogging, mostly about my children\u2019s development, and I feel better about all those years that I didn\u2019t write about the kids (although most of those years were documented in IEP paperwork). Their development is described in detail in over four hundred blog posts. I no longer feel like I should write about them individually once a year, because I write about them all year long.\nBut this year was a milestone year with Nigel starting high school and making some incredible social gains, and now that we\u2019ve reached the end of the first year, I thought I\u2019d recap the highlights:\nSeptember: Nigel advocated for himself for the first time at an IEP meeting and learned to safely and responsibly ride his bike to and from school independently.\nOctober: Nigel turned 15 and wrote a guest post. Also, he and I had a difficult discussion about not learning to drive yet, he successfully used his cell phone for the first time when he had a problem with his bike, and he revealed that, after many years of self-loathing, he is learning to accept his autism.\nNovember: Nigel, for the first time ever, joined a sports team, and my heart soared at his achievement. In other news, he prepared and drank a pizza smoothie.\nDecember: Nigel\u2019s language skills took a step back (or sideways) with some lengthy delayed echolalia, and then dramatically forward with the most amazing conversation I\u2019ve ever had with him.\nJanuary: Nigel (with Aidan) took his first solo flight! A mere week later, I overheard his first unprompted thank you! However, the month ended on a sad note due to his needing to quit the wrestling team for unfair reasons, but he handled it with the utmost maturity.\nFebruary: Nigel attended his first high school dance, but he still exhibited some heartbreaking social vulnerability.\nMarch: Nigel and I watched the movie Adam together and had a great discussion about it, and Nigel found his niche in his theater class, where he made some truly wonderful new friends. I got to meet some of them when Nigel attended his first play and I accompanied him, where I witnessed a beautiful spontaneous hug.\nApril: Nigel started shaving! And I experienced the wonderful novelty of enjoying myself in a restaurant with my sons and having a stranger compliment me on their behavior for the first time ever.\nMay: Nigel went off of his medication and has been doing an amazing job overall of self-regulating difficult emotions and managing his behavior. He also achieved the rank of Star Scout after six years of Scouting.\nJune: Nigel had a major seizure, his first. Then he had to say goodbye to extended family members and his long-time Scout friends before moving to Los Angeles to be with his dad.\nAs you can probably gather, Nigel\u2019s growth this year has been tremendous. When I look back to his earlier years, still not functionally verbal at age five with extreme sensory and behavioral issues, I can\u2019t believe all that he has accomplished. This year alone blows me away. It\u2019s been a lot of work, with a great deal of assistance in various forms, but he has continued to learn and to succeed on his own terms, as I knew he would. I know there will be future struggles; he still requires constant assistance academically and will continue to need help with social issues. But we\u2019ll take it on. My son gives me so much hope that I can\u2019t wait to see what the next school year will bring. I know it won\u2019t be easy (none of it has been), but ultimately, it will be good.\n\nNigel, age 11, being a tiki at Pu\u2019uhonua National Historical Park, Hawaii, 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2009/10/20/a-drop-in-the-bucket.html", "http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2009/11/20/a-little-boys-dream.html", "http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2010/3/20/the-plays-the-thing.html", "http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2010/4/19/taking-the-evening-off.html"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/07/06/ninth-grade-a-review/", "title": "Ninth Grade: A Review"},
{"date": "June 22, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tThese goodbyes are just about killing me. Since school is out, I did what I usually do at the end of every school year \u2013 I write a thank you note to those who had worked with my son, telling them how much I appreciate all they\u2019ve done. Only this time, it wasn\u2019t a thank-you-for-the-great-year. It was an I-can\u2019t-thank-you-enough-for-the-difference-you-have-made-in-my-son\u2019s-life.\nA few days ago I sent an e-mail to the Regional Autism Consultant for southern Oregon, who has known Nigel since his non-verbal days and worked one-on-one with him years before she took her current position. I think she has worked with my son for twelve years. So I began with, \u201cYou\u2019ve been in the picture so long that it\u2019s hard to come up with an adequate way to thank you\u201d and proceeded to express my gratitude for all that she has done, including designing Nigel\u2019s weekly social skills class (and recruiting other students to be in it) specifically for him. Her gracious response made me cry, of course, especially when I read \u201cNigel\u00a0brought such wonderful perspective to the social skills group, he was so very open and honest and a very active participant which really made the group successful \u2013 I will miss him so very much.\u201d\n*\nLast week, I took Nigel to his last Scout meeting, where they had a goodbye party for him. Being in this particular Scout troop has been so beneficial for Nigel, for many reasons. As can well be expected (due to terrible news stories about\u00a0abuse in some\u00a0Scout troops), a Scout troop is only as successful \u2013 and as good \u2013 as its leader. And I don\u2019t see how there could possibly be a better Scoutmaster out there. We are so blessed with the troop that Nigel\u2019s been part of for almost six years. Our Scoutmaster is by far the most patient person I\u2019ve ever known. He also truly cares for Nigel. When the party was over and it was time to leave, the Scoutmaster said some generous parting words about Nigel and his progress as a Scout, and then he asked Nigel to stand at the door so that every Scout could shake his hand on their way out. I was so touched, so emotional, that I couldn\u2019t even watch.\nOur main consolation, which I keep reminding myself, is that we have close family that we will be able to see much more often in L.A. The boys can spend unlimited time with their father, who has lived there for over eight years. They have an uncle and two aunts there who adore them. And then there is their grandfather, who plans to take them to Thailand later this year. I have missed all of them tremendously over the years that we\u2019ve been apart, and I\u2019m so looking forward to sharing more of our lives with them. But as important as family is, kids \u2013 especially teenagers \u2013 need their friends.\nAs we drove home from the Scout party that night, Nigel said to me, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to find such good friends ever again.\u201d And of course that really did me in. I croaked, \u201cOh, honey. I know that your friends here mean a lot to you, and you\u2019ll miss them so much. But you\u2019ll be able to find new good friends in L.A. And they will find you. Because you are a very friendly, caring person, and good people will always want to be friends with you. I really believe that, Nigel.\u201d\nHe simply said, \u201cYeah.\u201d But there was hope in his voice.\n*\nThe boys have gone now. They are in L.A., barbequing and bodysurfing with their dad, while I remain in Oregon (for now) to sell the house. I have started sorting through things and packing, slowly but purposefully. Over the weekend I came across an assignment that Nigel had done in middle school, during a time when he was being bullied relentlessly. It was from around the time that he had taken his yearbook and scribbled on all the faces of the kids who had bullied him, and when I looked at it later I cried because there had been so many scribbled faces.

{"date": "July 14, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nIt would be\u00a0almost impossible to enumerate the many things we learn from our children, particularly those who have special needs. Infinite patience, for one. Hope. Perspective. Appreciation. Acceptance. Love. And maybe a thing or two about dinosaurs or natural disasters.\nBut with each of our children, special needs or not, if we really stop to think about it, we might find that one thing stands out above all else. The one thing that we really needed to learn from them, and from them alone. I wrote recently that what I have learned from Nigel is the power of belief. \u00a0More than anything else, every day of his life, Nigel has taught me to believe. But what I have learned from Aidan is just as valuable.\nIn a word \u2013 surrender.\nWe\u2019re not conditioned to view surrender as a good thing. To most of us, it means giving up. But to me, surrender means letting go. It means letting go of that which I cannot control. It means letting go of expectations placed upon a near-typical child. It means accepting What Is. And it\u2019s something that Aidan, even more than Nigel, has taught me every day.\n*\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t write as much about Aidan. This website is called Teen Autism, and Aidan was never officially diagnosed on the spectrum. He did, however, experience a significant delay in language development, necessitating speech therapy until almost age ten. But what really affected him \u2013 and still does \u2013 is his sensory processing disorder. He must have been miserable as an infant, toddler, and even a preschooler. It wasn\u2019t until age five that he seemed to be somewhat at home in his body; he was finally talking and smiling more often than crying and yelling.\nBut his eating issues continued to get worse. Whereas I would call Nigel a picky eater, Aidan is a limited eater. A year ago, as he was nearing 13, I started to realize that it seemed to be a control issue with him \u2013 not to control me, but to have some control in his life. He couldn\u2019t control that his dad, whom he idolized, lived 700 miles away. He couldn\u2019t control that he had an autistic brother. But he could control the food that he decided to eat. So what started off as a sensory issue developed into something even more involved.\nAnd it bothered me greatly, not just because I worried about his health and his growth. It bothered me that I couldn\u2019t just cook dinner for my child and he would eat it. Even at age 13! It bothered me that he was a teenager and, like his brother, should have been eating me out of house and home (even though Nigel is picky, he still manages to eat a variety of foods, and in mass quantities). And it bothered me that Aidan would eat more food when he was with his father. I took him to see a counselor, and he fought me, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re making me do something against my will!\u201d I compromised, telling him that if he increased his dinner choices to seven things, one to rotate each day of the week, that we would stop going to the counselor. He reached that point within three weekly sessions, and although I followed through, he has since lapsed to five or six items on the rotating dinner menu.\nSo I surrendered.\nI let go of my expectations about Aidan\u2019s eating habits. I let go of my expectations about how he responds to having an autistic brother (hint: it\u2019s not always noble or gracious). I had to surrender. I had to. And I thought that if he could spend more time year-round with his dad that he might start eating better when he\u2019s with me, too.\n*\nHe has been with his dad for over three weeks now. I\u2019ve talked to him several times, and the last time I did he told me, with excitement and pride in his voice, \u201cI\u2019ve been trying lots of new foods, Mom! I\u2019ve been eating a lot.\u201d And I told him, choking back tears, that I was so glad to hear it.\nAnd someday soon I will tell him that there is nothing I wouldn\u2019t have done to help him to be as happy and healthy as possible. I will tell him that it\u2019s okay that he\u2019s not always glad to have an autistic brother, that I honor his feelings. I will tell him that I accept the fact that he eats differently. And I will tell him that I have become a more balanced person because of it, because of learning to surrender.\n\nAidan, age 9, being a tiki at Pu\u2019uhonua National Historical Park, Hawaii, 2006\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/07/14/surrender/", "title": "Surrender"},
{"date": "July 20, 2010", "body": "\n\t\t\tAs is common in many autism homes, we had PECS cards all over the place. We started using them when my son was three years old and sort of phased them out of use by the time he was ten or so. And they were a godsend. We could tell him when we were going somewhere, he could tell us what he wanted, or we could tell him what needed to be done instead. We could use them to make visual schedules so that he could anticipate what would happen when, to ease his anxiety. And one card that we used quite often was the Different Card. If the day\u2019s plan deviated from the norm or what he was used to, we would show him the Different Card with the two arrows pointing in opposite directions (one up, one down), and he could process the change. Even in his non-verbal days, we\u2019d show him the Different Card and sometimes he would just nod slightly in acknowledgement and then keep moving, seemingly unfazed. He knew something would be different, and he mentally prepared himself the best he could.\nWe\u2019re three weeks into July. I thought by now I\u2019d be writing about how crazy-busy I am with packing my home, downsizing a four-bedroom house into a two-bedroom apartment. I thought by now my house would be sold. I thought by now I\u2019d know where my children, especially my teenage son with autism, would be going to school in September. I thought by now at least some of the unknowns would have revealed themselves. \nBut really, I had only hoped. After all, how realistic were any of my thoughts? And hope, though fervent, is still wishing. Sometimes I feel foolish, sometimes resigned, often dejected. When things aren\u2019t going the way you\u2019d hoped, how else should you feel? \nIt\u2019s hard to keep at it, to remain hopeful. But I\u2019m a long-time special-needs parent. My son has taught me to believe, and I am a champion of hope. It\u2019s what I do, what I\u2019ve done all along. My major moving plans are not going the way I\u2019d hoped, but regardless, I know that life will work out the way it should. It always does, whether I worried or not. Whether I planned or not. \nAnd that\u2019s when the other thing that we do best comes into play \u2013 when things don\u2019t turn out as we hoped they would, we adapt. We go with Plan B (or come up with one on the fly) and keep moving, because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve always had to do. That\u2019s our life. And whether it feels that way or not, I think that\u2019s actually pretty hopeful. \nAs for my situation, what will be, will be. It will be different than how I\u2019d thought, but that\u2019s okay. I know different; I can handle different. My son has trouble handling different, but we\u2019ll get through it. I\u2019m not sure if the Different Card will work as well this time (or if I even still have it), but he\u2019s come a long way since his non-verbal days, and maybe he\u2019ll just nod his head and keep moving, like he did all those years ago. \nI\u2019m hoping.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2010/07/20/the-different-card/", "title": "The Different Card"},

I\u2019m a heat-seeker. I thrive on the warmth, crave it all year. So I love the weather. But I hate missing my kids.\nThis is their ninth summer in Los Angeles with their dad, 700 miles away from me. For nine summers I have sat at my desk and stared at their pictures and talked to them on the phone. My \u201cconversations\u201d with Nigel haven\u2019t always been on track, but he\u2019s gotten better as the years have gone by. And I\u2019m just glad that he has the ability to talk on the phone in the first place. Because that wasn\u2019t always the case. These nine years have brought so many changes.\nSo I sit here, looking at my desk photos, clicking through summer posts from 2008 and 2009, wondering what the heck I wrote about when my kids weren\u2019t even here. I wrote about several phone conversations, and I did a series on Nigel\u2019s early development. I wrote book reviews and posted about miscellaneous autism and special needs topics. Last summer I wrote about my incredible trip to Nepal for autism education.\nBut this summer I find myself at a loss for material. My main sources of inspiration are not in my presence to say funny or profound things. Our phone conversations consist of what-did-you-do-today and I-miss-you and the occasional movie idea/obsession monologue.\nBut the real reason is that I\u2019m not at my emotional best right now. I\u2019m disjointed without my boys, I\u2019m disappointed that my moving plans aren\u2019t coming together, and I\u2019m disheartened in general. Plan B will go into effect soon, and it\u2019s a letdown. I can dress it up and say that I\u2019m hopeful, but it\u2019s not at all what I had hoped for. It just doesn\u2019t seem right \u2013 or fair \u2013 to have the blues in the summer.

{"date": "May 14, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tLanguage acquisition is, of course, not just about learning to talk. Non-verbal communication is another confusing realm that autistic people must enter if they wish to\u00a0interact appropriately.\nInitially, Nigel\u2019s non-verbal communication skills were limited to how he could make his needs known non-verbally, since he was not functionally verbal until about age 7. He could talk prior to that age, but most of the words that he spoke were echolalic. If he wanted me to get him something out of the refrigerator, he would take hold of my hand and lead me to the refrigerator and put my hand on the door handle. I would have to guess what he wanted, and a wrong guess would be met with a scream. This was the extent of his non-verbal communication at the time.\nHe progressed to using PECS, both for his expressive and receptive communication, which was a blessing for both of us, reducing the screaming at least while at home (in public, with his extreme sensory issues, the screaming continued). Once he started uttering one-word need-based requests, his use of PECS at home decreased, and then he moved on to two- and three-word combinations. At that point, the concept of non-verbal communication changed from expressive to receptive.\nHe started making eye contact. It was fleeting, of course, at first, and only reserved for family members and the most familiar of therapists, but it was there. He started to notice and interpret facial expressions, mostly limited to smiles, but gradually he could interpret the more obvious\u00a0manifestations of sadness and anger. His favorite one to interpret, still to this day, is tiredness with its unmistakable yawn. \u201cGo sleep?\u201d he would say at age 6. Now, at 13, we hear\u00a0the beautifully correct and appropriate, \u201cAre you tired?\u201d and even \u201cWhy are you putting your head on the desk?\u201d\nNigel\u2019s greatest accomplishment with interpreting non-verbal communication still astounds me, and always will. It happened about six months ago, when his NT friend Riley was at our house for a sleepover.\u00a0Earlier that week, Nigel had seen me taking my daily birth control pill and asked what it was. I told him in simple terms that it prevented babies from forming in my uterus. Riley\u2019s mother had had a baby a year and a half ago, and now Riley was telling us that his mother was going to have another baby. My sixth sense kicked in, or mother\u2019s intuition, and I knew that the wheels were quickly turning in Nigel\u2019s head. I was seated at the other end of the dinner table from him, and I looked at him fiercely, willing him to look at my wide eyes telling him Don\u2019t say it! Don\u2019t say what you\u2019re going to say! And he started to say, \u201cShe should\u2019ve \u2013\u201d and abruptly stopped as soon as he saw my face. It was the first time he caught himself before making an inappropriate comment because he had successfully interpreted non-verbal communication! I was so relieved, and equally amazed. Later I talked with him about the fact that I was glad he stopped himself from saying, \u201cShe should\u2019ve taken birth control pills!\u201d I told him that would not have been a polite thing to say. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like \u2018polite,'\u201d he said, which is what he says when he doesn\u2019t understand something\u2019s purpose. At least if he can continue to interpret non-verbal communication (and not just his mother\u2019s), he stands a chance\u00a0of learning what\u2019s not polite, and avoiding it.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/05/14/words-best-left-unspoken/", "title": "Words Best Left Unspoken"},
{"date": "May 15, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tYesterday I wrote about non-verbal communication and Nigel\u2019s development in that area. I ended that post with an anecdote about his emerging ability to read others\u2019 non-verbal communication so that he would not say inappropriate things. On the flip-side of that, I also want to discuss the appropriate things that need to be said, because he often has just as much trouble with those.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Nigel has just recently begun to comprehend the importance of this phrase. I\u2019m sure there were many times that I tried to get him to say it, to parrot it, when he was younger, but the time that I remember the most was when he was 6 and we had some friends\u2019 children visiting at our home for a barbeque, and he was running around chasing them. In retrospect, I should have known that he was too \u2018escalated,\u2019 too wound-up to register anything that I said to him. But I was still learning about autism and how it affected him. So he was being chased by a 3-year-old, laughing, probably enjoying the interaction because he always craved it, and Nigel ran into his bedroom and shut the door quickly, not realizing that the 3-year-old\u2019s fingers were already in the door frame. I immediately took the little boy into the kitchen to have someone soak his hand in cold water, and then I went to tell Nigel that he needed to say he was sorry. Again, I was still learning about how autism affected him and I didn\u2019t realize that he couldn\u2019t say sorry because he could not comprehend the word. So when I told him to say it, he just said, \u201cNo sorry, no sorry.\u201d I demanded that he say it or he would have to stay in his room the rest of the day. He repeated his \u201cNo sorry\u201d mantra\u00a0and then began screaming.\nTwo years later, a neighborhood girl verbally provoked him beyong his level of coping, and he allegedly \u201cpunched\u201d her. The girl ran to tell me what Nigel had supposedly done, so I took him inside and told him that if someone is bothering him or making him mad, he should come and tell me instead of doing something to them that would get him in trouble. Later, he said he wanted to say he was sorry to her, so I walked him to the driveway and he went up to her and did it on his own. Then, while walking back home, he asked me, \u201cWhy do we say \u2018sorry\u2019?\u201d He knew what he was supposed to do socially, but he still didn\u2019t understand why. I think that now, at 13, he understands why, because he\u00a0says it readily and remembers to do it on his own.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d however, he often forgets to say. Often, as in on a daily basis. I know that he understands the reason\u00a0for saying it, but he just doesn\u2019t do it unless prompted, much to my dismay. I could understand\u00a0having to prompt him when he was younger, but he\u2019s now a highly verbal 13-year-old! I guess I have to just keep doing what I\u2019m doing, keep up with the repetition, and hope that one of these years he\u2019ll get it.\nGreetings are another gray area for him, and always have been. He often greets a household guest by walking up to them and showing them his latest Lego creation. I have to remind him, \u201cSay \u2018Hi, Grandma\u2019 and give her a hug!\u201d and then he does. He has to be coached on the phone as well.\nI think the reason why these words and phrases are hard for him is because they are vague. They\u2019re not nouns or adjectives or verbs (with the exception of thanking). There\u2019s nothing to visualize. And for someone who is a visual learner, that makes it difficult. For someone who\u2019s also trying to learn, at the same time, how to be socially appropriate, it\u2019s a lot to absorb and apply. He\u2019s mastered sorry, finally. I still have hope for thank you and hello.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/05/15/words-that-must-be-said/", "title": "Words That Must Be Said"},

I have written previously about his use of echolalia to communicate and how it progressed through different stages over the years (stages that I identified and labeled on my own: please note that they are not \u201cofficial\u201d). The teachers and therapists who have worked with him at various times, especially in the early years, but even now, have often commented on his ability to take lines from videos and use them within the context of\u00a0a situation.\nNigel has always loved the Disney movies, especially the animated ones, but at the age of five he began watching some of the live-action films. He loved The Swiss Family Robinson, and still does. One day, his behavioral therapist, unaware that he had been watching that movie at home, told me that when Nigel got angry at her he had said, \u201cIt\u2019s my gun, you\u2019ve got no right to take it!\u201d Imagine the awkwardness as I tried to explain to her that he had taken that line from\u00a0a movie. I wonder if she was thinking that I routinely left guns laying around the house and reprimanded my children when they picked one up. The movie scene in question was when the older brother took the younger brother\u2019s gun away from him, and the younger brother was angry about it. Nigel said the line as a way to indicate that he was angry about being told to do something he didn\u2019t want to do. When I explained the movie scene to Nigel\u2019s therapist, I could see the relief wash over her face. Then she said,\u00a0\u201cI understand now!

He also likes to take words or phrases that he\u00a0remembers from movies, TV shows, or something he picks up online, and try to use them appropriately. Sometimes he is successful with this, other times not. Today during homeschool, while working on subtracting mixed numbers, he did it seamlessly.\nNigel: I don\u2019t want to do subtraction.

A\u00a0scream would usually be forthcoming.\u00a0These days, the wild look is more often because something has ignited him, and he goes into obsession mode. A part of me is glad to see it, because that means he is happy and engaged, but a part of me is wary because he has been known to tie strings across the entire backyard\u00a0or the living room and post signs all over the house regarding his obsessions (he put up\u00a0six \u201cFallout shelter in basement\u201d signs during a nuclear war obsession of the week and we don\u2019t have a basement).\nAnd with this particular obsession, Rube Goldberg machines, there would certainly be lots of string involved.

{"date": "May 5, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tNigel had a pet mouse for six months. It was the cutest little beige-colored furry thing. It was his own responsibility to feed him and change his bedding and water, which he faithfully did. Nigel named him Jonathan after Jonathan Brisby in The Secret of NIMH, one of his favorite movies and books. He told me that he held\u00a0Jonathan every night for five minutes before going to sleep. One morning last week I noticed that Jonathan was curled up in a ball on the floor of his cage and not visibly breathing.\nIt has been interesting to me over the years to see the progression of Nigel\u2019s acceptance of death. His first experience was at the age of nine, when our first cat, whom we all loved, was hit by a car a mere 50 feet from our house and instantly killed. Our neighbors called to let me know, and I brought the cat into our backyard. I went inside to tell Nigel and Aidan, who had very different reactions. Aidan began sobbing, and as I consoled him, Nigel became very angry and stormed out to the backyard. I hated to leave Aidan as he was, but I had an even worse feeling about Nigel\u2019s state. I found him pulling his bike out of the shed, buckling his helmet (odd that he had remembered), and about ready to ride off, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to find whoever killed Max and kill them for revenge!\u201d After my initial shock over the length and complexity of his sentence, rare at that age, I somehow was able to\u00a0diffuse his anger and help him let go of his need for revenge.\nSeveral months\u00a0later, Nigel and Aidan\u2019s great-grandfather died. He lived a few hundred miles away, and they had only seen him twice, but they sure loved that man. I think Nigel internalized his sadness because he\u00a0didn\u2019t know\u00a0how to deal with it. Sometimes now, three years later, he\u2019ll come up to me an hour after his bedtime to say, \u201cI keep thinking about my great-grandfather.\u201d That\u2019s good, I tell him. That way you\u2019ll always remember him. But I\u2019m sure that right now he would want you to get some sleep.\nAbout two months ago, we had another cat die. He was a day-time roamer, but he always came home every evening. I think someone in the neighborhood got tired of him coming in their yard, trapped him, and dumped him on the other side of the highway that runs through town. I found him three weeks later, but he appeared to have been dead for just a week or so. He had been hit on the highway on his way back home to us, loyal cat that he was. So I brought him home to bury him, and Nigel calmly helped me.\u00a0\nHe\u00a0tells me all the time that he misses that cat, but he has never indicated a desire for revenge, which I am glad to see. And even though I haven\u2019t seen him cry about the death, I know he is dealing with the emotions surrounding it. Last month my father had surgery to remove a tumor, and when I told Nigel about it, he said, \u201cWell, if he dies, just\u00a0don\u2019t tell me.\u201d At first it sounded like he was being calloused, but I knew what he meant. He didn\u2019t want to know about it because he didn\u2019t want to feel the sadness again. And he knew it would be worse this time.\nI am happy to report that my father came through surgery and is recovering very well. Jonathan the mouse, however, didn\u2019t make it. And so, I tried to think of the best way to tell Nigel. I thought of saying, \u201cHave you checked on Jonathan today?\u201d\u00a0or \u201cI think something\u2019s wrong with Jonathan,\u201d but I settled on the more direct, \u201cNigel, I\u2019m sorry to tell you this, but Jonathan died in his cage.\u201d When I said it, Nigel stiffened; I could tell that it shocked him. But then he said, \u201cWell, rodents have a short life span.\u201d He went to go look at the mouse, and I asked him if he wanted to help bury him. \u201cNo. That would cause too much sadness.\u201d So I did it myself, reflecting on his ability to identify his emotions and knowing what his limits are with how much he can handle. I think that\u2019s pretty amazing. I wish I could have that outlook on my whole life.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/05/05/autism-and-death/", "title": "Autism and Death"},
{"date": "May 1, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\tIn his quest for friendship, Nigel regularly requests sleep-overs. It took a while for him to accept the fact that he could only invite friends to spend the night at our house, as opposed to inviting himself to spend the night at friends\u2019 houses. I think he now understands the way that works, after about\u00a0three dozen\u00a0reminders. So last weekend, he invited two\u00a0brothers from one of the Scout families we know to spend the night, and I made some mental notes as I watched Nigel\u2019s social development in action.\nHe spent most of the evening in echolalic mode, which worried me. He used echolalia as a tool to be social before he was functionally verbal, but we don\u2019t usually see much of it these days. The exception to that is when he is stressed, which sometimes happens when he\u2019s trying to make peers think that he\u2019s just like them. What he was doing Friday night was not what I call stage 1 echolalia, which is parroting (repeating back what is said to him). He started off with that between the ages of 3 and 6, and moved on to what I call stage 2 echolalia, which is repeating random lines from videos he has watched. Stage 3 echolalia is repeating certain lines from videos and trying to fit them within the context of the situation. Stage 4 is taking those strategically used lines from videos and customizing them by inserting correct names and other details relevant to the situation. Nigel now mixes stage 4 with his own spontaneous speech on a daily basis. But occasionally, when stressed or unsure of himself socially, he reverts to stage 3 and even stage 2.\nDuring dinner Friday night, he was so worked up that he was quoting random lines from the live-action Scooby-Doo movie. I think he was trying to make the kids laugh, because he could hear the movie in his head and it was making him laugh, and he was trying to share that with them. But by merely spouting the lines randomly, he only caused confusion for the boys. They were polite and accepting, but they didn\u2019t know how to respond, and I could tell they were uncomfortable. So I had to poke my head in the room and try to steer the conversation to a different topic.\nI aurally checked in a few minutes later, and Nigel was doing a little better. He had moved on to stage 3, and\u00a0I overheard him say a line from Jurassic Park: \u201cIn 48 hours I\u2019ll be accepting your apologies,\u201d when\u00a0his friend\u00a0accidentally bumped him. By the time dinner was over, he was back to mostly employing his own speech, which I think occurred because the boys started talking about James Bond movies, which is Nigel\u2019s Obsession of the Week. Aidan and the two guests were discussing the\u00a0story about the painted girl in Goldfinger dying because her skin couldn\u2019t breathe, and the fact that Mythbusters disproved it. (I smirked back in the kitchen and refrained from telling them about my college days, when\u00a0a friend of mine did a photography project using models painted in all one color, and I was yellow. Suffocation was not a concern at that point.)\nBut the good part was that Nigel had calmed down enough to interact appropriately with his peers. How he was acting earlier made me think that he was probably like that at the middle school, and there was no adult around to moderate the conversation, so things just escalated to the point where an intolerant NT kid punched him in the face or told him to run laps around the field and laughed at him.\u00a0It\u2019s easy to see how he reverts to the stages of echolalia when he is over-socialized because it\u2019s comfort behavior. It\u2019s something that he knows. When some random kid at school is talking to him, he doesn\u2019t know what to expect. So he starts playing a movie in his mind and starts verbalizing the lines that he\u2019s hearing because he knows what comes next. And that is one of the reasons why mainstreaming won\u2019t work right now. He still has a lot to figure out in the social realm. I certainly prompt him when I can, when I\u2019m there, but most of it he\u2019ll have to do on his own.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfinger_%28film%29", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters"], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/05/01/the-social-realm/", "title": "The Social Realm"},
{"date": "May 3, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\nAidan: Why the heck, Nigel, is your stick in my room?\nI overheard Aidan say this last night as I was walking down the hall, and I empathized. I, too, have found Nigel\u2019s sticks in many places throughout the house, including the kitchen, the living room, the car, my desk, and my bed. Nigel\u2019s stick obsession has probably been lifelong, and to the best of my knowledge, neither he nor anyone around him has ever lost an eye, thank God. I\u2019m not sure where this obsession stemmed from, but it\u2019s most assuredly not abating any time soon. And I bet one of the things he loves about Scouts is\u00a0being able to handle sticks on a regular basis.\nBut the real reason I\u2019m writing this post tonight is to highlight Aidan. He\u2019s been feeling a little like second fiddle lately, aware of all the writing I\u2019ve been doing about Nigel on this site, even though I\u2019m careful to\u00a0minimize the screen when\u00a0he (Aidan) comes in the room. He\u2019s been pretty verbal about his feelings, too, accusing me of going easy on Nigel and not being fair, playing favorites. I try to spend as much alone-time with Aidan as possible, let him know how loved and important he is, but I can imagine it must be so hard for him. What\u2019s not fair is that he\u2019s the younger brother and he always feels like the older brother. What\u2019s not fair is that as much as I try to\u00a0ease the burden of him having an autistic brother, it\u2019s still there. And it always will be.\nSiblings are the unsung heroes of autism. Parents, therapists, caregivers, and teachers are openly praised \u2013 and deservedly so \u2013 for all their efforts with the autistic people they work with and care for. But the siblings are\u00a0not often highlighted, and they should be. Some siblings have had to share a room for years and learned to tolerate the noises and habits of someone who doesn\u2019t talk, or whose speech is echolalic. Some siblings have gone to the same school and had kids come up to them, many times, to say, \u201cDid you hear what your brother did today?\u201d And in spite of all that and so much more, they take it in stride and learn to love this person who seems so different and strange and often annoying. The siblings know that even if they\u2019d like to poke their autistic brothers in the eye with the very sticks they leave in their rooms, it\u2019s just another thing they\u2019ll have to live with, and they do. Maybe not without exasperation, but with acceptance nonetheless.\nAidan, I\u2019m so proud of you.\n\t\t\t\t\t", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://teenautism.com/2008/05/03/sibling-angst/", "title": "Sibling Angst"}
