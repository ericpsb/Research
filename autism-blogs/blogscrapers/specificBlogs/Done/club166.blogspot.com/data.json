Two of those Yakuza later donated $100,000 each to the medical center.\u00a0 I'm sure HUP realizes that Paul Corby doesn't have that kind of scratch laying around ready to donate to them.\u00a0 Which is perhaps why they wish he'd JUST GO AWAY.\u00a0 Again, from the letter  \n \n \n. ..if you want to pursue transplant consideration for him, you of course have the option of a second opinion at another center. \n \n\u00a0Autism is not a death sentence.\u00a0 Unless, of course, it's combined with a failing heart, in which case it's enough to get you disqualified for a chance at a cure. \n \nOther stories on this subject can be found in  The Washington Post ,  New York Daily News ,  Strollerderby blog , and  Wesley Smith's blog . \n \nA change.org petition on this is located\u00a0 here.   \n \nHUP accepts comments  here. \n \nIf you'd like to contact Dr. Brozena and let her know your opinion, her published email address is: \n \nbrozenas@uphs.upenn.edu \n \nHer other published contact info is as follows: \n \n \nUniversity of Pennsylvania Health System \nHeart Failure/Transplant Program \n6 Penn Tower \n3400 Spruce Street Philadelphia, PA 19104 \nOffice: (215) 615-0812 \n                          Fax: (215) 615-0828 \n \nI think that Dr. Brozena needs to know that it's OK to change her mind. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XZhP6q1htZc/UC79cbv1r6I/AAAAAAAAAzY/GmTHZi7jYOY/s1600/TinMan.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/54164255/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/deed.en", "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2009/11/30/the-seattle-god-committee-a-cautionary-tale/", "http://www.aei.org/article/health/the-god-committee/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/after-adult-autistic-son-denied-heart-transplant-pennsylvania-woman-seeks-to-reverse-decision/2012/08/17/db4778aa-e834-11e1-9739-eef99c5fb285_story.html", "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/23-year-old-pennsylvania-man-autism-denied-heart-transplant-hospital-article-1.1137708", "http://blogs.babble.com/strollerderby/2012/08/07/family-young-man-denied-heart-transplant-because-hes-autistic/", "http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/secondhandsmoke/2012/08/17/should-the-autistic-be-denied-organ-transplants/", "http://www.change.org/petitions/help-my-autistic-son-get-a-life-saving-heart-transplant", "https://www.pennmedicine.org/submit-question/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2012/08/if-they-she-only-had-heart.html", "title": "\nIf They (She?)

It. On.\" \n \nI wouldn't bet against Stu in that matchup. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2012/04/hero-in-new-jersey.html", "title": "\nA Hero in New Jersey\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 6, 2011", "body": "\n photo credit- SeaDave Creative Commons license Liz related that these were the words that Buddy Boy said when he entered the meeting at the school this afternoon.  Was this a disciplinary meeting, an IEP meeting, something worse?  No.  Buddy Boy's principal (who has a special education background) asked Buddy Boy if he would mind talking to a group of teachers and staff about autism.  Dr. D. is a fair person who has high expectations from all of her students, and has also gone out of her way to give Buddy Boy the benefit of the doubt in multiple instances when he has gotten into \"situations\" at school.  We will miss her next year when he goes to middle school (for those that are not regular followers of this blog, Buddy Boy is currently mainstreamed in a regular 5th grade class). Dr. D. had a few lunchtime meetings with Buddy Boy to discuss what questions she was going to ask him in front of the group (things like how he felt about being autistic, what he liked about it, what difficulties it presented, etc.).  I'm not sure what the purpose of the gathering was, but it included teachers from all of the district schools, including the middle and high schools.  In short, it was a pretty full room. Now you would think that most people would be a little nervous talking to such a big group.  I myself get nervous talking in front of groups, and I teach!  For his part, Buddy Boy gets extremely anxious when he does anything with his peers.  He WANTS to be involved with them and do things (singing, band), but at the last minute his anxiety is so high that he has a lot of difficulty partaking in performances, even when he is only one of a group of many that is performing.  Thank heaven for occasional  guardian angels. But this afternoon, in front of a room full of teachers, he was in his element.  Not a trace of anxiety.  He stood in front of them, talked for about 10 minutes, then fielded questions for another 10 minutes or so.  I suspect he helped their understanding of how autistics think both directly and indirectly (at one point he did one of his 270 degree segues, saying \"...speaking of which, if we could harness the space inside of atoms, we could probably come up with a new energy source to help people out\"). The audience was friendly and respectful.  One art teacher, who had had him briefly as a student 5 1/2 years ago for a couple of months (when we had a  really bad experience  in Kindergarten) said that she remembered Buddy Boy.  Buddy Boy turned to look at her, addressed her by name, and told her he remembered making a \"pinch pot\" with her.  It's amazing the things he remembers sometimes.  Another teacher related how when they were covering a unit on caves, that she learned new things from Buddy Boy that she had not known about caves before. Liz and I both agree that many there were probably surprised that Buddy Boy considers his autism a \"gift\".  He admits that it causes difficulties sometimes, but he definitely sees the upside of being autistic.  He came to this all on his own, without us trying to push him in any particular direction.  I think it's great that they see such a perspective, so that perhaps some of them will also see the upside of being autistic, and not pigeonhole students with negative assumptions.  I also think it's great that Dr. D. sets such a great example to her teachers and staff.  She really gets the message out that she wants ALL of her kids to succeed. I just think it's great that I can write a post regarding school and a meeting, and feel good about it.

{"date": "Thursday, May 12, 2011", "body": "\n photo credit- Eric the Fish Creative Commons license A medical license is a precious thing.  Most people that have one have worked darn hard to get it.  They've put in decades of education, paid a lot of money, and sat for numerous exams.  They usually feel proud to have earned their diploma, and often don't think much about their medical license, once they've passed the appropriate exams (that is, they don't think about it until they get close to their mandatory re-certification exams every 10 years).  The license is often viewed as just \"one more hoop\" that they have to jump through before they can practice. But perhaps they should think about their license a bit more.  While their diploma from their university and certificates from post-graduate training are (mostly) their own, their license represents the social contract that society has with members of the professions.  A medical license granted by the government gives one broad authority-you get to set up shop in your field, admit patients to the hospital, charge fees that are often paid (at least in part) by insurance companies and the government, and have people allow you to cause them all sorts of pain and embarrassment, all in the pursuit of curing or alleviating whatever ails the patient that walks through your door.  The state allows members of the profession (collectively) to have great say in educational standards, and grants them at least some exclusivity (keeping competition from untrained persons suppressed, which also protects the public).  In return, members of the profession have obligations towards the state/community in which they are licensed.  They are to be honest, have a positive obligation to keep current in medical knowledge in their field, not practice in areas in which they are not trained, put the patients' welfare before their own, and always strive not to harm patients. While it is upsetting when people in the community are hoodwinked by, say, a dishonest roofing contractor, people get more upset when a doctor acts unethically.  Even in today's busy world, where people see multiple different doctors, the medical encounter between patient and physician remains an intensely personal one, \"protected\" by this social contract.  It is because of this that people get more upset. Fortunately, the profession, and the pubic, have a way of \"righting the ship\" when things go wrong.  State medical boards are usually mainly staffed by physicians, with a few members of the general public.  All of these members are usually appointed by the governor of the state, in a (fairly) non-political manner.   The only compensation usually received typically is a small per diem to cover travel expenses to the capital city (which is usually where meetings are held). In any profession there will be frauds and crackpots.  That being said, my experience is that the vast majority of physicians have worked very hard to get where they are, and really seem to be motivated to do the best for their patients.  But in order to retain the trust of the public it is necessary that those who practice fraudulently are weeded out.   It is a big deal to take someone's license away.  As I mentioned, they have spent decades of their life preparing to sit for their exams, and invested hundred's of thousands of dollars, before ever seeing their first paying patient.  Thus investigations of impropriety usually take time.  A medical board is not in the business of stifling innovative practice, and must guard against disciplining doctors whose only crime is being smarter than the norm.  But the board IS charged with protecting the public, and thus has to identify and discipline those who ignore their responsibility to practice in accord with scientifically sound practices, and who would view their license as merely a cash generating vehicle. The Maryland State Board of Physicians has suspended the medical license of Mark Geier, M.D., in an emergency measure to protect the public while he has a hearing before final disposition.  In  their 48 page report , the Board details how Geier practiced bad medicine (making mis-diagnoses of precocious puberty without standard physical exam or laboratory findings being documented), performed fraudulent research (no consent forms, totally improper in-house IRB committee, poor research design and execution), and allowed his untrained and unlicensed son to practice medicine in his office in his absence.   Kathleen (Neurodiversity Weblog)  and  Prometheus (A Photon in the Darkness)  both have very good posts detailing a lot of the bad things he's done, and why he richly deserves to have his license yanked. Reading through this report, one thing is eminently clear.  Mark Geier will never practice medicine in Maryland again.  Boards don't get this much damning evidence documented, and then let someone off with a slap on the wrist.  While his final discipline may read something like \"License revoked with no re-application for at least 5 years\", there is no way that any future board will let him get his license back.  Not after this. In regards the other states that Geier has licenses to practice medicine, his license remains active at this time.  That (in most cases) will automatically change once his permanent suspension or revocation action takes effect.  Most state boards automatically put the same restriction on your license as other states do, unless you can prove to them that you don't deserve it.  I am not aware of anyone ever overturning one of these automatic revocations.  So while he technically can still practice somewhere else, one can take solace that that option will soon close for him. While this SHOULD put an end to those spinning wild theories and foisting wholly unproven treatments on autistic patients, it won't.  But perhaps it might give a few of those unethical practitioners that have medical licenses just a bit of pause now, as they realize that perhaps their own hucksterism might have the light of truth shined on it next.

{"date": "Monday, May 23, 2011", "body": "\n Photo credit- topgold Creative Commons License One of the hallmarks of autism that is often cited is that autistics tend to miss important social clues.  I must admit that this is something that we see often with our son, Buddy Boy (though he has made great strides in carving out \"his own way\" of initiating interactions). Most people think that if they see someone that \"doesn't get\" typical social clues, that that must mean that that person is autistic.  Well, not necessarily. Take David Geier, for instance. As the whole world now knows, David's dad, Mark Geier, had an  emergency suspension of his right to practice medicine  recently, due to the medical board catching up with his totally off the wall (and dangerous) antics in \"treating\" autistic patients.   As was patently clear from complaint against his father, David was up to his eyeballs in this, examining patients in his dad's office.  David also had an appointment to the State of Maryland's Commission on Autism, which listed him as a \"diagnostician\".  His one and only degree, an undergrad B.A. in Biology, in no way qualifies him for such a title. Now, as anyone that follows politics in any part of the world knows, there are a certain portion of politicians and appointees that get caught up in scandals.  And there is a certain way of conducting oneself that is expected in such situations.  When one is caught up in a scandal, it may be OK to sit tight for a couple of days, to see if things blow over.  But once you're actually charged with something, and if someone from the governor's office asks you to resign, you're toast.  Your only acceptable course of action is to resign, as quickly and quietly as possible.  Not to do so makes you look terrible, as well as causing needless embarrassment to the one who appointed you in the first place.  Even  really rich and important people  know when to throw in the towel when they get caught.   Unfortunately, David Geier is the type of person my grandma would have said \"...doesn't have the sense he was born with.\"   Once the whole scandal blew up, and the lengthy and detailed complaint made it obvious to all that this would not end well for the Geier's, one would think that David would have quit the autism commission.  Well, he didn't. Once he himself was charged with  practicing medicine without a license , you would think that he would immediately recuse himself from any public position.  Well, he didn't. When David wouldn't/couldn't see the handwriting on the wall, he was asked to resign.  As reported  here , he refused.  So  finally  the governor of the state of Maryland had to come out and  publicly fire him .    I'm thinking that the governor will not be so quick to appoint charlatans with transparently false credentials in the future.  And much as I'd like to feel sorry for David Geier, I just can't.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/topgold/4549334122/", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/topgold/4549334122/in/photostream/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2011/pr11187.htm", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/Geier_David_charges.pdf", "http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-autism-doctor-20110504,0,7987287.story", "http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-geier-autism-commission-20110520,0,7952945.story"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2011/05/missing-important-social-clues.html", "title": "\nMissing Important Social Clues\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 27, 2010", "body": "\nThere's been a story going around that I just heard about a couple of weeks ago.  Abbie Dorn, a young mother of triplets who suffered severe brain damage due to complications during delivery, is in a legal battle to see her children.  Her ex-husband, who divorced her just a year after the event, saying he needed to \"move on\", has prohibited their three (now four year old) children from visiting her, and even prohibits anyone mentioning her at all to them.  Oh, and after she received a malpractice financial settlement, he's reportedly suing her for child support. Good Morning America  covered this story on April 14th of this year, and played up the \"tragedy\" of the whole situation.  It wasn't terrible coverage, but it wasn't too great, either.  It didn't really scratch the surface, so was more exploitative than anything else, as far as I was concerned. On July 10th I happened to catch this story for the first time on  CNN .  The Dorn story starts about 3/4 of the way down the transcript that is linked here.  After going over the basic facts, the CNN anchor went to Dr. Wendy Walsh, a clinical psychologist who specializes in relationships for commentary.  I must admit that I am usually biased against talking head TV psychologists.  They either seem to a) say something that is so \"common sense\" that you just go \"Duhh\", b) try to wedge whatever topic it is into pushing some agenda of their own, or c) come up with some off the wall thing that they couldn't possibly infer from never ever meeting or talking with the principle people involved. Dr. Walsh's comments both surprised and pleased me.  She was both thoughtful and insightful.  After the story focused (much like GMA) on whether Abbie could actually communicate or not thru blinking, Walsh immediately cut thru that to comment And, you know, the question is, who cares if she can communicate or not? There's a living, breathing mother there...Who deserves to see her children. And the children, you know, Don, kids - everything is new and normal in the world of small children. I don't think that they'll be overly traumatized. Would people prefer that they're given a cold teddy bear to comfort them? Walsh quickly followed with And, you know, the biggest question this raises for me, Don, is what's going on in our culture that we institutionalize people with disabilities to the point that now we think it's just so wrong to even look at them or be exposed to them? What does it say that we're sweeping away the ugliness and not allowing families to have an integrated experience with people with disabilities? I think it's making us lose our compassion for people with disabilities.   Walsh also blogged on the story on her own blog  here , where she also wrote I\u2019m concerned that the more we insulate people, young and old, from seeing the full range of human possibilities the more we limit our capacity for compassion. My hat's off to Dr. Walsh.  Rather than settle for a superficial recounting of a \"tragedy\", she cared enough to dig a bit deeper, and provide some thoughtful analysis.  Like a good documentary film maker, she challenges us to think deeper not just about this particular situation, but about ourselves and the wider world. Maybe I should pay more attention to TV psychologists.  Or at least this one.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/brain-injury-mothers-family-fights-children/story?id=10367832", "http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1007/10/cnr.08.html", "http://www.drwendywalsh.com/blog/2010/07/is-it-okay-to-deprive-four-year-olds-of-their-mother/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2010/07/tv-psychologist-gets-it-right.html", "title": "\nTV Psychologist Gets It Right\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, January 1, 2011", "body": "\n for some reason Blogger's not letting me post pictures tonight, so no pictures for you This year the kids are 8 and 10.  Sometime soon after last Christmas, Buddy Boy stopped believing in Santa, and ever since then when talking to us about him would make some \"air quotes\" with his fingers when saying his name.  Letting us know that he was big now, and he  knew  that it was a scam.  He  promised  not to tell Sweet Pea, but of course such promises are hard to keep, and he spent the run-up to the holiday this year in telling her repeatedly that it was just parents. Sweet Pea has asked several questions, to which we usually just reflected back at her, \"Well, what do you think?\"  With all the logical power that an 8 year old that wants to believe could muster, Sweet Pea came up with reason after reason that Santa had to be real.  \"I saw it on TV (how he gets down the chimney), he's very fast, and the presents are there with our names on them, so who would have left them?\"  Buddy Boy has been arguing logic back at her \"Why aren't there any sooty foot prints?  Parents can eat the cookies we left, how does he get all around the world in one night?\", etc. Coming down to the finish line, I thought she was faltering.  \"Some kid said that Santa died a long time ago.  No one's that fast, and Santa's not G_d.  A lot of the kids (even Christian kids) are saying he doesn't exist.\" But in the end, wishful thinking won out.  She decided that Santa \"...must be a ghost.  That's how he does it.\"  Of course that  would  explain everything, I guess.  There's no corporal time limit on how long you can do the job, no limit on how fast you can get around the world, etc.  I guess I never considered that the \"Spirit of Christmas\" might actually refer to old Santa himself! As for Buddy Boy, he came downstairs yesterday and announced to Liz that he \"...was going to make a New Year's Revolution\".  \"I think the word you want is 'resolution', dear.\"  \"Oh, yeah. A New Year's Resolution.  I'm going to be nicer to Sweet Pea this year (he's actually overall nicer to her than she is to him). [he paused] I've got another resolution.  I'm going to help Sweet Pea be nicer to me, too.\" If only the world worked that way. Happy New Year to one and all!  This last one has been a bit tough (lots going on behind the scenes and all), but I'm hopeful that the coming one will be better.  At least we all made it through 2010 in one piece, and neither kid got kicked out of school!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2011/01/christmas-spirit-and-new-years.html", "title": "\nChristmas Spirit, and New Year's Resolution\n"},

That if you run hot water in the sink and put enough toothpaste in it, it makes the bathroom \"smell good\"? That if you put half of a (large) bottle of hair conditioner into the bathtub and stir it up enough, it makes a decent amount of bubbles (the residue is also VERY slippery during dad's shower the next morning)? -------------------------------------- Buddy Boy has discovered that inserting scatological silly references into conversation and using them in a loaded question is very funny-to him-but perhaps not so funny to his teachers. Last week he asked his teacher something to the effect of \"Did you poop in your diaper this morning?\", which earned him a trip to the principal's office, and an assignment for him to present something to the class this week on \"Respect\". While bringing in the poster that he was going to use in the presentation this week, the principal said good morning to him.  He responded \"You know, Dr. P, I think I may have discovered that there are some negative things about being autistic.  Do you want me to tell you about them?\" -------------------------------------- I was driving Sweet Pea to her speech therapist this morning (her \"R's\" might pass in Boston, but not here, and her inability to properly pronounce \"L's\" or to differentiate \"S's\" from \"SH's\" earns her a weekly Saturday morning at speech (after both she and Buddy Boy have ice skating classes), and her and I doing speech exercises about 3-4 nights/week. The nice thing about this is we have a little father daughter time to ourselves in the car.  Today we were driving along and out of the blue she says \"You know, dad, times are hard.\"  First I thought that perhaps my 8 year old had just had an economic revelation.  Then I wondered whether she had a twinge of social consciousness, and that perhaps I could be really proud of my little girl.  Just to be sure, I asked her \"What do you mean?\"  \"You know, dad, doing times.  5 times 3, 5 times 4.\" ---------------------------------------- Buddy Boy goes to a social skills class every week.  Perhaps it's starting to pay dividends.  Today he asked Liz, \"So, we should have a discussion (I think this was a \"homework\" assignment).  But I don't know how to start.\"  \"Well, what do you want to talk about, sweety?\" \"How about machinery?\" --------------------------------------- Angels exist, and sometimes show up at the best times. This last week we had the first 5th grade band concert.  As you  may recall , although Buddy Boy loves band, the teacher doesn't necessarily feel the same way about him.  So although we're very happy that Buddy Boy loves band, we were also both very anxious going to this concert, and hoped to escape the night without Buddy Boy doing something that would give the band leader an excuse to discharge him.  We dropped him off in the designated classroom, and went to the gymnasium to wait and fret. As soon as the band started walking in, we saw his angel.  Walking with him was his 3rd grade teacher (who we loved), Mrs. C.  Mrs. C always went \"above and beyond\" when working with him that year.  Both Liz and I dared to exhale, and palpably felt 1000 pounds (454 kg) of anxiety fall away from us.  The band took their seats, and Mrs. C sat next to (and a little behind) him.  Mr. C (Mrs. C's husband) works with the band (the brass players, not the woodwinds).  He was there that night, and though Mrs. C had called in sick that day, she showed up that evening to be with Buddy Boy (evidently she had become aware of Buddy Boy's \"troubles\" in band thru her husband).  We didn't know that anyone was going to be with him on stage, much less Mrs. C. The long and short of it, Buddy Boy did fine (even if he did talk a bit more than appropriate to Mrs. C during the concert).  Buddy Boy even had a brief solo (about 2/3 of the band volunteered to do solos, including Buddy Boy).  He played his solo about 3 times slower then we practiced at home, and it was so soft as to be barely audible, but he got thru it without any major mistakes, and did fine. G-d bless Mrs. C.

{"date": "Sunday, October 31, 2010", "body": "\n Good News!  Buddy Boy has decided that he likes the clarinet, and wants to play in the school band.  For 5th grade music, students have a choice of either taking a \"normal\" music class, or participating in the band.  Buddy Boy chose the band.  He wanted to do this when school started, and he wants to do this now. Bad News!  We came home to find this letter: \"Buddy Boy\" is not finding much success in band.  He is able to play alone when we do solos, but when the whole group plays, he is not able to focus on what we are doing and participate.  He is often taking apart and putting together his clarinet.  When he does play with the group, he is overblowing and squeaking quite often.  He is probably trying to play louder so he can hear himself, but this causes him to have a poor tone and squeak.  \"Buddy Boy's\" behavior during class has improved and having \"Mr. Jones\" with him has been helpful. Our interactions with Buddy Boy's present school have been pretty straightforward, with only a few bumps in the road.  Most of the time, his teachers have liked him (the most important thing you can look for, IMO), and have approached any problems with an attitude of wanting to find a successful solution for him. I suspected band was going to be a problem.  The band teacher is a district wide teacher.  Not only is she the teacher for the grammar school (up through 5th grade), but also for the middle school and high school.  So we're stuck with her for the duration.  5th grade band is (as I stated above) offered as an alternative class for music, not as an elective after school activity.  Students attend during regular class hours.  When he expressed his wish to join the band, Liz took him to the band leader, to see what she recommended as an instrument.  She looked dubiously at him, and stated something to the effect of \"I think he'll be able to possibly play the clarinet, if that\".  We were hoping that Buddy Boy's determination and charm would slowly win her over, but that appears not to be happening. About four weeks in we got a call that Buddy Boy's behavior was unacceptable.  Liz asked if the leader had discussed this with his regular or special ed teacher (she had not).  I think she expected us to say \"Oh, well, we'll just withdraw him from band.\"  As he really likes it, we're not going to do that.  Like most kids on the spectrum, he takes a while to \"get\" new situations.  With a little guidance (and yes, some forbearance on the part of others) he eventually settles in, and does reasonably well.  After that conversation, \"Mr. Jones\" was added as an aide during the class, to help him not be disruptive.  No mention ever has been made regarding Buddy Boy's ability to play. For our part, we took him for some private lessons over the summer, knowing he wanted to play.  He didn't learn much music, but started to get a grip on some of the basics (how to put it together, where to put his fingers, how to play scales).  We thought he was doing OK.  I'm sure he's not the star of the band.  But he practices 3-4 times a week, and seems to do reasonably well (he can play several of the songs sent home with him).  When I work with him, in addition to having him play at his own pace, I either count or hum, to simulate the rest of the group playing, and get him accustomed to playing on a group rhythm.  Most of the other kids have not played before, so it's not like the rest of the group is filled with virtuosos.  We can't take him for private lessons during the year.  He has about an hour after school where he will pay attention, and that time is used every day by Liz keeping him current with homework and stuff he didn't finish in school.  Saturday mornings he takes part in the only regular physical activity that he'll still do, ice skating lessons.  We don't want to discontinue that. In the US, we have laws like the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) and IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) which theoretically ensure that each individual will be treated fairly, and not discriminated against.  But the law is one thing, and attitudes another.  And when individuals decide that they don't like your kid, and don't want to \"deal\" with him, then it's an uphill battle.  Many studies have shown that teacher's preconceived notions of a child's intelligence determine whether that child will be successful in their classroom.  And it just appears to me that this particular teacher decided up front that our kid just wasn't going to be successful. I'm not sure how we're going to proceed on this.  I don't think they have to keep him in band (they could say he's not working out, he has to take the \"regular\" music class).  So calling an IEP and making demands for them to make it work might indeed backfire.  So I suspect we'll talk to his other teachers, and possibly the principal (who has mostly been supportive and understanding), and see what we can do.  Somehow I doubt that we'll change the band teacher's attitude, but I'd at least like to see Buddy Boy be able to stay in band this year. ------------------------ Apologies for not posting more often.

{"date": "Tuesday, June 8, 2010", "body": "\n photo credit- newagecrap creative commons license Unfortunately, one of the things that has become obvious to me over the years is that the general public doesn't have a clue what it's like to raise a special needs kid, has no real desire to know what it takes, and when times are the least bit tough the public is especially willing to throw our kids under the bus if it will help their own situation in any way.  This is true, whether it's a smaller, relatively well off district like  the one we live in , or a large one such as  Los Angeles . One might expect that the Superintendent for one of the largest districts in the country would be a little savvy when it came to talking about how resources were allocated during an economic downturn, and would refrain from saying things that were just REALLY STUPID.  When L.A. schools Supt. Ramon C. Cortines was talking about a school for the blind in the LA Unified School district he recently said, \"Some of those are very, very severe cases, but you have to look at it in perspective. When you fund some of the special ed things, you're taking from regular kids.\" Aside from it being blatantly against the law for economic considerations to be driving who gets what services, there is the whole \"attitude\" thing.  The attitude that says that special needs kids are not \"regular\" children.  The subtext that assumes that they won't become productive members of society, so why invest any money in them.  When such attitudes result in self fulfilling prophecies, they are felt to be proof positive that they were right all along.  The attitude that while \"regular\" education is a right in this country, that special education is a privilege that can be easily revoked at the first sign of money trouble.  The attitude that my kid (and millions like him) just aren't worth it. I have found, as I stated, that such attitudes are not limited to uneducated or poor people.  Indeed, my personal feeling is that such attitudes get worse, the higher up the socioeconomic scale one is on.  It doesn't matter what overall political viewpoint you hold.  Platitudes regarding equality rapidly fall apart when it comes to spending a dime on special needs education instead of the football team. I don't know what the solution is.  I'd like to think that the only solution is success.  Being out there, in the public eye, as much as possible.  Expose the public to successful former special ed. kids as much as possible, and eventually they'll change their mind.  And holding them to the letter of the law until then.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/TA26Z36U2GI/AAAAAAAAAx4/dN9Z56unlOo/s1600/schoolhouse.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/billgarrett-newagecrap/2983441266/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-disabled-20100602,0,7041114,full.story"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2010/06/inconvenient-truth.html", "title": "\nAn Inconvenient Truth\n"},

The  Wrightslaw.com website  (run by two people named \"Wright\"-who would have figured), which is a great source for getting/keeping yourself informed with all things having to do with special education law.  They also publish a  few books , which I have found helpful. The use of restraints and seclusion in U.S. schools has been a fairly hot topic over the last few years in the U.S.  There are at least 3 different (general) views on this.  One, that all people deserve basic human rights, and tying them down and putting them into locked closets at school are not the type of thing that should be done to anyone.  A second view (we'll refer to it as \"the ignorant view\", for lack of a better term), thinks that special ed kids shouldn't be mainstreamed with the general population in schools.  And if they are, then if they are at all \"disruptive\" then it is perfectly OK to do \"whatever it takes\" to preserve peace and quiet in the schools, including tying kids down, putting them in locked closets, or having them arrested.  And wouldn't things just be much better if they all just went back to \"some other place\" to be  educated  warehoused.  A third view is (roughly) that any proposed laws will never do what we think they will do.  The bills will just be used to normalize abnormal treatment of the disabled, including instituting/requiring ABA treatment as the \"gold standard\" of  education  cruel and unusual punishment. Federal laws (referred to as \"bills\" before they are passed) are passed in the U.S. by being voted on by two houses of Congress, the House of Representatives (or just \"House\") and the Senate.  After being signed by the President (or in some cases, even after them not being signed) the bill becomes law. The U.S. House passed H.R. 4247 (the House version of the bill), and passed it on to the Senate.  The Senate version is referred to as S. 2860.  Evidently the Senate version would change how student's Individual Education Plans, or IEP's, are administered.   Wrightslaw sent out an e-mail alert today, stating:   The Senate would let school staff put restraint and seclusion in a child\u2019s IEP or 504 plan. Call your Senators now and ask them to reject this proposal. The Proposed Amendment to S. 2860 Will Take Away IDEA Rights.  Unlike IDEA, 504, and ADA, the Restraint/Seclusion bill has been written to prevent parents from seeking to enforce it in with lawsuits.  The new law (S. 2860) would take precedence over the old law (IDEA).   The Wrightslaw alert also included these helpful instructions for taking action: How to Call Your Senator    1. Always use the bill number, S. 2860, Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act.  Please call; Senators pay more attention to calls.  Email may get lost.  Use Email only if you must.    2. Dial 202-224-3121 (TTY 202-225-1904) or go to www.senate.gov, click on Senators for contact information (including local numbers).  You will have 2 Senators.  When you call, ask for their Education or Disability Aide.  Leave a detailed voicemail message if they are not available.  Be sure to identify the bill by name, Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act and use the number, S. 2860.    3. Please call your Senators - but especially if you live in these states on the Senate HELP Committee: AK, AZ,  CO,  CT,  GA,  IA,  KS ,  MD,  MN,  NC,  NH,  NM,  OH,  OK,  OR,  PA,  RI,  TN,  UT,  VT,  WA,  WY.  If you are in these states, check the HELP Committee website so you call the Senator on the Committee, http://help.senate.gov/.  If you have friends or family in the Committee states, please get them to call.  And even if you are not in a Committee state, please call.  Senators from all over the country are impacting this bill.    4. Call Senator Tom Harkin and ask for his disability counsel (phone 202-224-3254, fax 202-224-9369).  Senator Harkin chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, http://help.senate.gov/ and has much power over this bill.  He needs to hear from parents and advocates from around the country; he certainly is hearing from the other side. Here is a link to  http://www.senate.gov/ , which has a nice little \"drop down\" box on the top right to find your own state's senators, and to the committee page for the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee,  http://help.senate.gov/ . Senator Tom Harkin, from Iowa, has always been a pretty good advocate for disability issues.  He is also the Chair of this committee.  Even if you don't live in his state, I urge you to contact him, and not let this portion of the bill be included.

{"date": "Friday, July 2, 2010", "body": "\n photo credit- navets creative commons license I'm not the kind of person that immediately shouts for someone to lose their job when they do something wrong.  We all make mistakes, and jobs are hard to come by nowadays. But I'm also the kind of person that gets their dander up when organizations try to sweep problems under the rug, and whitewash a situation to cover their own backside. I  recently wrote  about how two police officers in Tybee Island, Georgia tased a young autistic man who was sitting outside a restaurant waiting for his brother, who was inside.  They not only tased him, but wrestled him to the ground, bruising him and breaking his tooth in the process.  Originally, the police chief did what might be expected.  He defended the actions of his men, and even went so far as to \"blame the victim\" and his family somewhat by saying that he was sorry that he had been left \"unattended\".  That last statement, which implies that no one with any kind of disability that impairs communication should ever be left alone, even for a few minutes, got me (and a lot of other people, I'm sure) very upset.  I don't realistically expect that the whole world will change overnight, and that the world and everyone in it will totally understand my autistic son as he grows up.  I also don't think it unreasonable that he should not have to fear being beat up and tased for sitting on the curb outside a restaurant on a hot day. Evidently there are some reasonable people living in Tybee, and some of them are actually in a position to do something.  According to this article: Tybee drops charges against autistic teen WTOC11 reports that, Tybee Island Mayor Jason Buelterman and Schleicher asked Police Chief Price James W. Price to have the GBI investigate the incident and make sure no laws were broken by police. Many politicians, both local and national, would have followed on what the police chief originally said, and would have tried to cover up the situation and hope it would go away.  I applaud the mayor and city manager, who asked a neutral party (the Georgia Bureau of Investigation-the state counterpart to the FBI) to look into the matter.  As police officers themselves, the GBI would have an excellent understanding of what proper police procedure in such cases should be, as well as having practical experience in similar types of situations.  Yet as a neutral party, they also understand that the public needs to have confidence in its law enforcement officers.  Law abiding public citizens should not have to fear their own police force.  When law enforcement officers \"go too far\", it impairs the ability of all other officers on the force in their ability to do their job.  When you are in a job that serves the public, you need to be accountable to that public.  You may not like it, but that's part of the job. According to another recent article in the Savannah Morning News,  \"Tybee Police Learn About Autism\" , the two police officers that arrested Clifford, as well as a jailer, have both resigned their posts.  The police chief has been suspended, and officers are now being sent for training on dealing with people with autism. My hat is off to the city of Tybee, for stepping up and doing the right thing.  Nothing will undo the damage that has been done.  Clifford will forever more be afraid of the police, and it will be that much harder for him to react calmly the next time he interacts with them.  But it looks as if the city is stepping up, doing what it can to prevent future similar occurrences, and weeding out a few bad apples (while sending an important message to the rest of the department). I don't know if the police chief will keep his job, or if he should.  I am not in a position to know what he knew, when he knew it, and what he has done in the interim.  But I trust now that the people of Tybee will do the right thing, because of what they've done thus far.  And if he does keep his job, I sincerely hope that he issues a much more heartfelt and all encompassing apology to Clifford and his family, for them having to have endured this.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/TDFcKsMeQNI/AAAAAAAAAyM/95r6hUvxVT8/s1600/blind-justice2.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevan/149560943/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://www.wtoc.com/global/story.asp?s=12711844", "http://savannahnow.com/crime/2010-06-15/tybee-police-learn-about-autism"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2010/07/honesty-justice-and-trust.html", "title": "\nHonesty, Justice, and Trust\n"},

At least not by yourself.  Because if you do, you're fair game for being tased by the police.  At least, that's what the police chief of Tybee Island, Georgia seems to think. A little over a week ago, it was a 14 year old boy being  arrested on felony terrorism charges  for drawing threatening one inch stick figure drawings on his homework.  Now it's an 18 year old autistic young man tasered after being confronted by police while he was sitting on the curb waiting for his brother and a friend to come out of a restaurant. WMBF news  reported yesterday  on how 18 year old Clifford Grevemberg was waiting on the curb outside the Rock House Bar and Grill for his brother and a friend to come out, when he was approached by two policemen.  According to  the police report , Clifford was staggering while walking back and forth in front of the establishment, and when questioned, responded that he was waiting for his brother to come out with some food. The police report said that one officer asked Clifford if he had been drinking, and he responded yes.  Of course, they didn't ask him  what  he had been drinking.  Unless he was asked if he had been drinking alcohol, my 10 year old son might have also responded in the affirmative, having drunken water, soda, or some other perfectly legal beverage.  The officers then asked for identification (twice), and when Clifford turned and began to walk away, they grabbed his arm.  Clifford, as might be expected, tried to retract his arm away from them, which gave these two police officers all the justification they thought they needed to taser him.  Which they did while forcing Clifford to the ground, causing a bruised face and a broken tooth. The Tybee police chief, in a  statement  given today, tried to explain away the incident by saying that Clifford gave the appearance of being intoxicated, and tasing him prevented further damage to both Clifford as well as the officers.  He gave a backhanded apology, saying   \"We are sincerely apologetic for the injuries suffered to Mr. Grevemberg. We are also sorry he was left unattended under the circumstances...\" In other words, if you are so brazen as to think that you have the right to walk or sit in a public place while being autistic (and you don't have an attendant immediately at your side), then you shouldn't complain when the police tase you and arrest you.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/S_sFomtcz1I/AAAAAAAAAxo/k56yKRhhGYA/s1600/taser-2.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/centralasian/4627311692/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://www.wmbfnews.com/Global/story.asp?S=12529625", "http://files.wtoc.com/web/Document.pdf", "http://files.wtoc.com/web/Document.pdf"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2010/05/geogia-zero-tolerance-for-differences.html", "title": "\nGeogia-Zero Tolerance for Differences\n"},

I watched the movie this last week with my family.  Overall, I would say that it was pretty good.  I don't expect Hollywood to get many things right, but I'd say they did a pretty fair job with this treatment.  Claire Danes did a much better job than I expected.  I feared before seeing it that she was much too \"glamorous\" for the role, but she did a good job of capturing the general tone, and playing things pretty straight. Here's the trailer from the HBO movie: Trailer Buddy Boy told me several years ago that his mind was like \"a video camera.  I can just hit rewind, and see things over again.\"  He had never heard of Temple Grandin at the time.  After seeing the movie, he asked if I thought Temple could teach him to think in pictures.  The HBO movie presented it as Temple thinking in black and white still pictures.  I guess he saw this as fundamentally different from his thinking like there's a video recorder running in his head.  I told him she probably couldn't teach him to think in pictures, as everyone pretty much thought the way they thought. For those who have access to HBO in the states, I think it's definitely worth a watch if you have time.  For those without HBO access, I'm sure it will be out on DVD soon.

A 14 year old Georgia boy has been charged with a felony (making terrorist threats) for a small (about 1 inch high) set of stick figures he drew on a paper in class.  The stick figures depict one figure (labeled \"me\") shooting another stick figure (labeled with his teacher's name).   There is no question that his drawing the picture was both inappropriate and wrong.  There is also no question in my mind that the school's response is so wildly disproportionate as to make me question why they would do such a thing.  There has been no allegation of the boy attacking his teacher, bringing a weapon to class, or even of having formed a definite plan as to how he would accomplish the task in his drawing.  There has been no mention of the school consulting with anyone else (the boy's doctor, their own psychologists, the police) to evaluate the situation as to how likely it was for the boy to be able to carry out his threat, much less evaluate the seriousness of the situation. Many people threaten to kill their spouses every day.  They very seldom get arrested, much less charged with making \"terrorist threats\".   So why would a school do such a thing? My guess (and it is a guess, as there's been no statement I've seen from the school) is that this charter school where the boy is enrolled wants to dump this \"problem student\" from their school, and that they are using this as a convenient excuse. Many charter schools don't want to spend the time and money it takes to properly educate children with special needs.  This could end up as a case of \"zero tolerance\" gone wild, but I suspect that, in the end, the school will come up with some \"compromise\" that will entail dropping or lessening the charge, as long as the boy withdraws from the school (or accepts another placement they have suggested).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2010/05/terrorism-really-or-get-out-of-our.html", "title": "\nTerrorism?

{"date": "Saturday, January 16, 2010", "body": "\n Will Be Hammered Down. So goes an old Japanese saying, meant to illustrate (as well as inculcate) a sense of conformity among the Japanese people.  Westerners (especially Americans) are supposed to place much more value on non-conformity and individuality.   But that idea only goes so far, and is noticably absent in the American public school system.  When it comes to school kids, conformity is king.  And if you step out of line, you  will  be hammered down, sometimes quite forcefully. Nowhere is this more evident then when it comes to kids with disabilities, especially those on the autism spectrum.  Often, kids on the spectrum have various sensory processing difficulties, and may also persevorate on certain things.  When they run into difficulty, they can get emotionally \"wound up\" fairly quickly, and appear to be \"acting out\" and being volitionally bad.  When given a little extra time and understanding, their behavior is most often a slight inconvenience to those around them, and at worst a slight nuisance.  But when those around them insist on total conformity, and react by touching the person and physically restraining them, then the autistic person (like most people physically restrained for reasons they don't understand at the time would) react with a \"fight or flight\" type of syndrome and lash out at those restraining them. Google the words \"child autism arrested\", and you quickly are faced with several stories over several years that seem to follow the same script: A child on the autism spectrum is placed in a regular classroom (often with a history of the family fighting for more support than what is being provided), said child \"acts up\" a bit (involving no or minor physical interaction with staff or other children), teacher reacts by physically restraining child, child \"lashes out\" (by kicking, pinching, biting), police are called, and child is arrested.  There is often no behavioral plan in place to deal with the child's behavioral difficulties, and if there is a plan, it is often not followed.  Children as young as 5 years old have been placed in handcuffs and arrested.  Others who are slightly older are not only arrested, but sometimes thrown in psychiatric institutions or jail. Such is the case with  Zakh Price , age 11 (his picture's at the top), who was arrested and charged with a felony.  Click  Zakh's name  to read Emily's excellent investigative piece into this latest travesty of justice. Another article detailing the facts can be found  here .  And Emily's follow up piece detailing some of the personal attacks made against Zakh and his grandmother can be found  here . This story rings all too true to me.  My son is in fourth grade, and while the police have not been called on him (yet), the school district had threatened to do that in the past, when he was 5 years old.  That  period of time resulted in a short detour to a class for emotionally disturbed children, LOTS of meetings (with their lawyers, our advocates, and our lawyer), and a bunch of money payed out in legal and consulting fees.  I was fortunate to be blessed with coworkers that allowed me flexible time off to go to all the meetings, as well as a job that pays well enough for us to afford the bills that came with this. Zakh is lucky to have his grandmother, Carole Reynolds, who is a staunch advocate for him.  Unfortunately, Carole is tapped out of the kind of money that legal representation requires, and she needs some help. The Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) has issued an  action alert , which lists e-mail addresses and phone numbers you can call to register your concerns.  A  website set up to take donations  for Zakh's legal bills has also been set up for him. I admit that I don't usually donate to online causes.  Not only are there so many of them, but it's often difficult to discern which are legitimate, and which are scams.  ASAN is a legitimate organization (Its president, Ari Ne'eman, has been nominated to be on an advisory council to the President of the United States), and Emily is a top notch, ethical person who's truthfulness and judgement I totally trust. So I'm asking you to do what I did.  Go to the  website , click on the \"Chip In\" button, and give what you can.  Even if it's 1,5, 10, or 20 dollars, everything will help.  And keep this family in your prayers. Unfortunately this story is not unique.  But it does seem to be much more common for school districts to try to get out of paying for proper supports for children with disabilities by dumping them into the legal system.  Perhaps there is also an attempt to silence those who would have the temerity to ask for support that the system is not willing to provide.  Perhaps such prosecutions are meant to silence those voices before they even speak up. Let the people in Fort Smith, Arkansas know that treating an 11 year old with a disability this way is unacceptable.  Support Carole Reynolds as she supports Zakh.  Go to  the website .  Make that donation. Now, before it's too late.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/S1E1I7OpjCI/AAAAAAAAAxI/kcfMaLpsbMU/s1600-h/Zakh.jpg", "http://daisymayfattypants.blogspot.com/2010/01/zakhquery-zakh-price-and-system.html", "http://daisymayfattypants.blogspot.com/2010/01/zakhquery-zakh-price-and-system.html", "http://www.examiner.com/x-4959-Special-Education-Examiner~y2009m12d30-Autism-is-considered-a-felony-in-fifth-grade?cid=edition-rss-National", "http://daisymayfattypants.blogspot.com/2010/01/and-zakh-case-gets-even-uglier.html", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=103", "http://zakhs.blogspot.com/", "http://zakhs.blogspot.com/", "http://zakhs.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2010/01/nail-that-sticks-up.html", "title": "\nThe Nail That Sticks Up...\n"},

{"date": "Friday, December 11, 2009", "body": "\n photo credit- Jun's World Creative Commons license Sleep. One of the most common, natural things there is.  Most of us never think about it much at all, until we (or someone close to us) has problems related to it.  There are a multitude of disorders that can affect our sleep.  Insomnia, sleep apnea (central or obstructive), narcolepsy, sleep paralysis, sleep walking, night terrors, etc.  You get the idea.  Sleep disorders of one sort or the other seem to be a lot more common in those on the autism spectrum. Buddy Boy has never seemed to require (or want) the same amount of sleep that most kids his age get.  We've tried regular routines, music, melatonin, night lights, and various other meds to try to get him to sleep thru the night.  We've gotten to the point where he'll go to bed at a predictable time (8:30-9:00 pm-not bad for an almost 10 year old), and  usually  sleeps until 6:00 am, though sometimes he's up at 2:00 or 4:00, and stays up for the day after that.  We're fairly accustomed to his routine.  That's not the problem. Sweet Pea, his 7 1/2 year old sister, has been having sleep related problems since August.  At first it was her getting up every night screaming.  When we'd come into the room, she'd complain that her stomach was hurting.  Mostly it was an epigastric centered pain, and only occurred at night.  When she woke in the morning, she still complained of stomach pain, and her diet (which Liz had pretty full of good things-protein, vegetables, fruit), devolved to milk, cheerios, and cheese.  Everything else hurt to eat (according to her). At first I felt it was most likely related to anxiety regarding school starting up (Sweet Pea is a fairly high anxiety kind of kid) and hoped that by not paying too much attention to it it would go away.  Well, Sweet Pea got into the swing of school, liked school, and it didn't go away.  I took her to a pediatric GI doctor near the end of September, after starting her on some Prilosec (Sweet Pea had reflux pretty bad as an infant, and I thought it reasonable that perhaps it had recurred).  The GI doctor agreed, and she is now on daily Prilosec.  The stomach aches have \"mostly\" gone away (though not completely-when she was an infant putting her on Prilosec changed her in 48 hours from a miserable baby who cried every night for three months straight to a happy, smiling kid).  Her diet, now that she's on the Prilosec, has once again normalized. Sweet Pea continued to wake up most nights, sometimes screaming, sometimes coming in to wake us up.  Most nights it's sometime between 1:00 and 3:00 am.  Although it's somewhat disruptive to me, it's majorly disruptive to Liz, who often can't get back to sleep (internship was good training for me).  For the last several weeks Liz has been sleeping downstairs in the family room, so as to try to get some sleep.  She also has not been very happy.  :( Sweet Pea's pediatrician has prescribed a mild anti-anxiety agent, which has helped some, but not completely.  Instead of 5-6 nights out of 7, we're down to 2-3 nights out of 7.  Not even paying her 25 cents to not wake us has helped (Sweet Pea will make lots of money when she grows up-she is very focused on making money-to the point that I constantly remind her of all the other  really  important things out there that are more important).   We, being experts in sleep as much as anyone out there, have tried as many different things as we could think of.  I'm not really looking for any new ideas, just venting a bit, I guess.

{"date": "Thursday, October 29, 2009", "body": "\n I recently had occasion to visit China (I was invited to give a couple of lectures there), and took the opportunity to arrange a visit to a school for autistic children,  Stars and Rain .  Strictly speaking, Stars and Rain isn't so much a school for autistics as much as it is a school for their parents, who come (with their children) for 12 week courses in how to educate their child.  There are very few resources for either diagnosis or treatment of autism in China, and Stars and Rain may have been the first school in China for autistics and their parents. The first person I met when I got there was the Development Officer, Sun Zhong Kai (Scott), who was the person I had corresponded with via e-mail.  I had asked a couple of times via e-mail if my visit would be too disruptive, and Scott said that it would be OK.  This gave me my first positive impression of the school, as it was more open to visitors than my kids' own school.  The second positive impression I got was when I asked if I could take pictures, and he indicated that it would be fine, as long as I didn't take any that showed the children's faces (as the school liked to respect their privacy).  A school that was open, and respectful.  Not bad, for the first 5 minutes.   Scott's background is that he was one of the first social workers trained in his university in Beijing.  He seemed very knowledgeable regarding autism, and had a very upbeat and friendly attitude.  He immediately put me at ease.  His English skills far surpassed my limited Mandarin, and we communicated just fine, despite the fact that due to a mixup I was without a translator for this trip. Scott took me on a tour of the facilities, which consisted of about 10 different rooms in a basic but clean building.  The teachers (I saw about a dozen of them) were very friendly and energetic.  There were also a number of college age volunteers that assisted during the day.  The students range in age from 3-12 years of age, though most in this group seemed to be from the younger part of that age range.   Although the school says on its website that they teach using ABA, they only use positive reinforcement, and from walking around and observing, it seemed a fairly loose mish-mosh of ABA, TEACCH, and good old-fashioned one on one instruction.  Scott stressed to me that part of Stars and Rain's goal is to change attitudes in China towards autistics.  He related that for the first time, the government recently recognized autism as a disability, and provides individuals a (very small) monthly stipend.   Stars and Rain was started in 1993 by the mother of an autistic child, Tian Huiping, with a couple of other parent volunteers and pre-school teachers who had never heard of autism before.  Initially it was a residential school for six children, who stayed at the school from Monday-Saturday, then went home for the weekend.  As demand was very high (and they lost space where they could stay overnight) the school decided to leverage what expertise it had, and transformed itself into a school where they taught the parents (accompanied by their children) how to educate their children themselves at home.  Terms run for three  months, with 50 families attending each session. The school has had visits from some US special ed teachers, and they have associated loosely with the  Heartspring  organization out of Kansas, USA. Besides the parent/child instruction, Stars and Rain also runs what Scott described as a \"demonstration project\", a residential home for six adolescent-adult autistics.  This facility is located a couple of blocks from the school.  There are about 8 staff that work in that facility, including 3 long term university volunteers (who were from Germany and Indonesia).  Education there is focused on daily living skills.  The residents go out and about in the community with the staff, and Scott reports that finally, in this location, they have built up a good rapport with the community which supports their presence (this is the school's third location).  All in all, I was mostly pleased with my visit.  Although they call themselves ABA based, what I saw was not the strict ABA that makes my skin crawl, but rather a much looser version that seemed to go with the flow of where the individual children were at.  The staff is friendly, dedicated, and seems to work very hard.  The facilities, although basic by Western standards, were quite adequate, and kept very clean. Whenever I feel disappointed about services that Buddy Boy isn't getting, or about problems we have, I will always now know that things could be a lot worse.  Stars and Rain is doing good work, but because of their limited resources they are limited in how many people they are able to help.  They have a waiting list of about two years for their courses at the present time.  I encourage anyone who wants to donate to them to send them a little cash via  this page .  You have to do a bank transfer, but it's not that hard.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SukM1_ITy-I/AAAAAAAAAwo/AhHdK4EHldM/s1600-h/IMG_2451.JPG", "http://www.autismchina.org/Default.aspx?alias=www.autismchina.org/English", "http://www.heartspring.org/worldreach/index.php", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SukOF4Z8BZI/AAAAAAAAAww/uoHh_dQpomE/s1600-h/IMG_2448.JPG", "http://www.autismchina.org/tabid/163/Default.aspx"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/10/stars-and.html", "title": "\nStars and Rain\n"},

In that campaign the NYU Child Study Center put out an ad campaign that implied that autistic individuals (as well as those with a number of other conditions) had been kidnapped.  This imagery was (not surprisingly) extremely offensive to many in the greater disability community.  After an intense counter campaign by disability advocacy groups, including  ASAN , the Ransom Notes Campaign was stopped. The above video takes up where the Ransom Campaign ended, and goes on from there.  Not content just to dehumanize autistic individuals, the Autism Speaks video goes on to paint a picture of horror using the most vivid imagery it can find-your marriage will fail, you will go broke, you will never be able to function in society at all, etc. And as pointed out over at  \"Cat in a Dog's World\" , perhaps the worst part about it was that they used video sent in by autistic families while they had their doom and gloom voiceover. Two years ago the NYU CSC claimed ignorance of the way that autistic (and other disabled individuals) felt.  The response at that time was heard throughout the country, even in major national media. I wonder what excuse Autism Speaks can possibly come up with this time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/", "http://autisticcats.blogspot.com/2009/09/autism-speaks-alfonso-cuaron-full-of.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/09/when-will-they-listen.html", "title": "\nWhen Will They Listen?\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 18, 2009", "body": "\n Some people may remember  the story  of the 5 year old Columbia, Il boy who had a service dog prescribed for him by his doctor, and had to fight a court battle in order to have the right to take the dog to his school.  The Kalbfleisch family won a court order to have the dog allowed to accompany their son to school, after spending about $50,000 on attorney's fees fighting the school district, and another $10,000 for training the dog, which was trained by  Wilderwood Service Dogs  of Tennessee.  The school district, which originally was willing to let Carter Kalbfleisch attend his home school, suddenly decided that the dog was not welcome.  So the school quickly called an IEP meeting, passed an IEP without the dog being necessary mentioned in it, and insisted that placement be in a special autism specific school, rather than Carter's home school.  The Carter's are going along with this placement for now, in order to get their son into school.  But they are continuing to fight to get him placed back in their home school. \"I think it\u2019s important for him to be in his own community with his local peers for him to look up to,\" said Kalbfleisch. \"It\u2019s very important for autistic kids for their communication skills and, later on in life, to get them interacting with people and into the real world.\" It never ceases to amaze me the lengths (and expense!) that a school district will go to in order to fight a parent.  When someone in the school district decides that they don't want someone in their school, they seem to have no qualms about spending obscene amounts of the taxpayer's money to fight individuals.  In this case, the Kalbfleisch's have spent $50,000 so far.  Further appeals will certainly take at least $10-$20K more.  If the family has spent that much, the school district has spent at least the same (and probably more, as they often put multiple lawyers against the single one that the family provides).  The special school that they are sending Carter to costs about $24K more than his usual school/year.  So figuring conservatively, the school district has been willing to spend $85,000-$95,000 this year alone just to keep one service dog out of a classroom, with an additional $24,000 every year to keep him out. It looks like a friend is going to be facing a similar fight against a school district, which has decided that it'll keep making the environment worse in order to force a child out of the family's preferred placement (their home school), in order to place him where he can be warehoused.  Please drop by  Kristina's temporary digs  and lend a little moral support. I've never met anyone quite so doggedly persistent as Kristina, and I know that she'll give this district a run for their money.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SrLvE4JnN0I/AAAAAAAAAwQ/UuPikuKe4ts/s1600-h/autism300aug202009.jpg", "http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/09/illinois-boy-with-autism-and-his.html", "http://www.wilderwood.org/", "http://autism.typepad.com/autism/2009/09/52-round-and-round-we-go-the-ideaiep-follies.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/09/dogged-perseverence.html", "title": "\nDogged Perseverence\n"},

Usually these are easily countered, and she is (temporarily) reassured.  It's gotten that many of the same things come up over and over again, so I've developed almost automatic responses: \"What if I don't like the job I get when I grow up?\" \"Then you'll get another.  I had a lot of different jobs before the one I have now\". \"What if a bad person breaks in our house and kidnaps me?\" \"The doors and windows are all locked.

{"date": "Wednesday, September 9, 2009", "body": "\n photo credit- jcesar creative commons license As most fans of the  \"Fab Four\"  know, today a digitally remastered collection of  Beatles songs  was released.   As most are surely aware, the group got their start playing in pubs in Liverpool.  But what I really want to talk about today is something else that Liverpool may become famous for- The Liverpool Care Pathway .  I bring this up to illustrate what I believe is one of the major ways that government directed/socialized medicine is potentially life threatening to those with disabilities. Basically, the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) is a standardized method of dealing with people that are expected to die soon in the UK.  It is a standardized treatment method that has been vetted by a panel of \"experts\" to improve how one dies in the UK.  On its surface, there is much to recommend it.  Rather than be hooked up to machines one doesn't want and subjected to procedures that have little probability of success, it is much preferable to die in relative peace.  I have often advocated for patients to have the right to say what they want, and have had many \"difficult conversations\" with patients regarding what kinds of interventions they wanted if they became unable to communicate.  But it appears that the LCP goes way beyond advocating for and implementing patients' wishes.  Combined with the  Mental Capacity Act of 2005 , which gives doctors the ultimate decision making authority when they judge patients unable to make their own decisions, the LCP allows patients to have fluids withheld and deep sedation given IV until they die.  Once doctors decide that you fulfill entry into the LCP, one's death becomes a  self-fulfilling prophecy , as the deep sedation masks any indication that you are improving.   The LCP was initially used for people with terminal cancer, but its use has expanded to patients with other conditions, such as after a stroke.  As  this presentation  shows, all you need to be entered into the pathway is to be hospitalized for 48 hours, and two of the following conditions present: \"- bed bound  - semi-comatose  - only able to take sips of fluids  - no longer able to take tablets\" It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that many people with disabilities might enter the hospital with at least one strike against them.  And combined with the  general attitudes towards the elderly and disabled  in healthcare settings, it isn't hard to see how some people feel that they need to  rescue their loved ones  from the LCP.  As noted in some of the articles I linked, it doesn't matter if your friends and family disagree.  Family members have been threatened with arrest for feeding their family member once they were put on the LCP fast track to death pathway. But why bring this up now?  Why don't I, living across the pond, just MYOB (mind my own business)?  Because of course tonight is the night that President Obama makes his pitch to push the current health care bill that is before Congress.  While I freely admit that there are many things that need to be fixed (including access and cost issues), I heartily disagree with the Utilitarian approach that government provided healthcare provides.  If there is going to be rationing (and basically all forms of healthcare provision involve some rationing at some point), I want to have the decision making capacity of what is provided, not have it be the decision of some anonymous government committee. As others have noted, the healthcare bill under consideration creates 52 new government organizations, including an independent advisory council on what are best medical practices.   Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel  (Presidential adviser and brother to Whitehouse Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel) has written: \"Substantively, it suggests services that promote the continuation of the polity\u2014those that ensure healthy future generations, ensure development of practical reasoning skills, and ensure full and active participation by citizens in public deliberations\u2014are to be socially guaranteed as basic. Covering services provided to individuals who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens are not basic, and should not be guaranteed. An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia.\" Emanuel sees a world where \"the community\" comes first, and individuals are only judged worthy of expenditure if they have value to the community (with not even a nod to the intrinsic value of all human life). So as you listen to the speech tonight, know what the President's adviser on healthcare is telling him, and what this bill before Congress will result in.  Don't think that you'll get healthcare reform passed now, and worry about the details later.  If you happen to get sick, there just might not be any later for you.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SqgsuEwOPhI/AAAAAAAAAwA/4a5S_cpo6_8/s1600-h/Simpson-Beatles.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcesar/405905728/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://www.bopped.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/entity/store/B000APTK6K?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=auto-sparkle&pf_rd_r=1GBSRPKAG5EYVCJVFG47&pf_rd_t=301&pf_rd_p=484404071&pf_rd_i=the%20beatles", "http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:t7x38N1lyX0J:www.nncc.nhs.uk/heartfailuretk/presentation_files/about_the_liverpool_care_pathway.pdf+liverpool+care+pathway+documentation&cd=15&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a", "http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2005/ukpga_20050009_en_1", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/6127514/Sentenced-to-death-on-the-NHS.html", "http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:t7x38N1lyX0J:www.nncc.nhs.uk/heartfailuretk/presentation_files/about_the_liverpool_care_pathway.pdf+liverpool+care+pathway+documentation&cd=15&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/mar/24/learning-disability-neglect-nhs", "http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/jul/08070205.html", "http://www.lifenews.com/bio2941.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/09/liverpool-more-than-beatles.html", "title": "\nLiverpool-More than the Beatles\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 26, 2009", "body": "\n Sullivan , over on  LBRB , recently blogged about a  new program  targeting autistic adults at Boston's MGH hospital.  This program has been made possible by a generous endowment from the  Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation .  According to the article,  Her (Nancy Lurie Marks) gift to Mass. General will pay for a range of new specialists and programs, including an electronic patient data repository for research, adult neurologists, social workers to help adults find work and housing, and a communication program to evaluate children and adults for devices such as computers that produce speech when a patient types on a keyboard. Bauman, who founded the hospital\u2019s multidisciplinary LADDERS program for children with autism, will become the MGH Distinguished Scholar in Autism, an endowed position, as part of the gift. I had never heard of this foundation before, so I went to their website.  There I found that the organization had been around since 1977, and according to the \"About NLMF\" section, The primary mission of the Nancy Lurie Marks (NLM) Family Foundation is to help people with autism lead fulfilling and rewarding lives. The Foundation is committed to understanding autism from a scientific perspective, increasing opportunities and services available to the autism community and educating the public about autism. When they're not supporting research and services to autistic individuals, the foundation has also sponsored documentaries such as  \"Autism is a World\"  and \"Voices of Vision: Quality of Life for People with Disabilities: Equity, Opportunity and Inclusion\". Now, this organization probably isn't perfect.  Not everyone would be in favor of everything they do.  Some of their research money supports genetic investigations, and some of their money has gone to support investigations using ABA type therapy.  But in going through their website, what is notable is what is NOT there.  No movies moaning how horrible living with someone with autism is.  And no hedging regarding vaccines, mercury, or whatever other voodoo people want to ascribe autism to.   In fact, the overall impression I get from reading through the Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation website is that we've regressed as a society since 1977.  Because evidently back then people set up foundations that respected individuals and wanted to work to help them succeed, as opposed to more recent times when people set up organizations to create \"awareness\" of how miserable autistics' lives are, and to support all of the non-scientific voodoo out there to \"cure\" autism.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SpR9QP-j_kI/AAAAAAAAAv4/qP4x5O0sfoc/s1600-h/NLM+foundation.jpg", "http://", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://www.boston.com/business/healthcare/articles/2009/08/23/mgh_to_target_adult_autism/?page=2", "http://www.nlmfoundation.org/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1wsiVYCqn0"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/08/what-autism-organization-should-be.html", "title": "\nWhat an Autism Organization Should Be?\n"},

I encourage others to also write him and express your opinions. ------------------------------------------ Dear Mr. Springsteen, I am writing you regarding your upcoming concert that you are doing in conjunction with Autism Speaks. I have been a great fan of yours for years, and must admit that I got a little teary eyed when I read a story of how your music helped an autistic child learn to talk.  My own son (who is autistic) also went through a stage where he sang a lot of songs (and bits from songs) instead of talking in the usual fashion.  I would have much preferred that he used \u201cBorn to Run\u201d instead of songs he heard on \u201cBarney\u201d. I am sure that by now you are aware of the controversy regarding the organization Autism Speaks within the autism community.  Not only do many parents of autistic children object to the way that Autism Speaks portrays those with autism, but more importantly those who are actually on the autism spectrum object to how they are portrayed. Although I don\u2019t know you, I sense from your music that you understand the underdog and the downtrodden in life.  Unfortunately, many autistics in society are bullied and abused, sometimes by the very people that are supposed to be helping them. The objections to the way Autism Speaks treats autistic individuals most recently revolve around a video that they released, but go deeper than that.  Autism Speaks, in attempting to \u201craise awareness\u201d, as well as funds for research on autism, has been consistent in using language that is not only disrespectful towards autistic individuals, but also absolutely false in many instances.  Those with autism have not been kidnapped or stolen, and are not monsters.  Autism is not a fatal disease, and thus should not be compared to cancer or AIDS.  Finally, Autism Speaks is perhaps the only major organization that purports to represent disabled individuals that refuses to include those with the disability on their board. This is not to say that those with autism don\u2019t have challenges, or that parenting those on the autism spectrum is a piece of cake.  But much of the challenge comes from living in a society that discriminates against those with disabilities, and lacks a true understanding of what those individuals actually require in regards to accommodations. I ask that you reconsider your association with Autism Speaks, as that organization neither represents either autistic individuals themselves nor contributes to their welfare.  Instead, this organization denigrates those on the spectrum.  I just don\u2019t see you as the type of person that would want to be associated with such an organization.

This should serve as a reminder of the importance of a strong, united Autistic community with a clear moral vision of a better future for Autistic people. Small victories like this remind us of what we can accomplish by working as one community on issues of every kind and size. Thank you to everyone who took action and in particular to the members of the blogosphere who first rallied the community around this.

But that still doesn't mean that I can't attempt to change what I consider to be an insult to my son, as well as other autistic people. So here is the text of the letter that I sent today: -------------------------------------------------------- Dear Sirs/Madams: As the father of a child on the autism spectrum, I am writing to express concern about the York, PA ASA chapter\u2019s billboard campaign that associates autism with being kidnapped.  I happened to notice one of your billboards while taking a vacation in Pennsylvania.  This campaign is reminiscent of the 2007 Ransom Notes campaign that was undertaken (and subsequently removed) by the NYU Child Study Center in New York City.   Comparing people with autism to those who are kidnapped is not only factually wrong (my son hasn\u2019t been kidnapped, he\u2019s right here in front of me), but is demeaning and offensive to those who are autistic.  Rather than \u201ccreating awareness\u201d, I can only see the logical end result of such an ad campaign be one of creating fear, misunderstanding, and disrespect towards those who are autistic. In Medieval folklore the image of a changeling was used to describe children with then misunderstood medical disorders or developmental disabilities.  Fairies or trolls were thought to have kidnapped the \u201cnormal child\u201d and left the changeling in its place.  One would think that in the 21st century we could get past such folklore, and deal with reality. Putting up ads that show such disrespect towards autistics will certainly not result in greater acceptance and integration in either the school environment or the community.  As an organization that ostensibly has been set up to serve the needs of the autistic community, I urge you to immediately remove the ads.  Furthermore, I strongly encourage you to consult with autistic self advocates before formulating future ad campaigns. Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon.

Many others will comment on the plan in general, but I want to point out what I think are some possible implications for care of the disabled. First of all, FULL DISCLOSURE-***I am a DOCTOR***.  Now I know in a lot of people's minds that immediately may make them tune out anything that I will say, assuming that whatever I say will be self serving.  I happen to think that since I have worked continuously in health care in one job or another continuously for decades (yikes!) that I may just have some insights into a couple of things.  Your mileage may vary. Basically, on the surface, today's talk by the President promised that nearly everyone will be covered, you won't lose your present doctor or insurance choice, you'll get all the health care you need, and it won't cost you or the country any more money.  Sounds great, right?   Well, anyone with a lick of sense knows that all of that can't be true.  So let's look at one of the things that WAS said, and think about it's implications. One of the things that has been advocated (and that the President heartily endorses) is some sort of a national group of \"health care experts\" that would determine what treatments should be covered.  This group would be a \"non-partisan\" group in Washington, D.C.  This is being sold as \"We'll eliminate unnecessary treatment\", but there have been no parameters floated saying exactly what kind of treatments they will eliminate in order to save money. I suspect that some of them may be reasonable, such as requiring prescription of generic drugs when available (though there are several times when patients react badly to a generic, and not to a brand name).  Also, undoubtedly, many services for senior citizens will be either delayed or denied.  Such things as hip replacements and knee replacements, as well as cataract surgery.  Criteria will be imposed, and if someone is judged either to be not debilitated enough, or not to have enough useful years left, then they will be left without service.  No one in the administration will admit this, but all healthcare economists pretty much agree on this.  This is certainly what happens in other countries that have nationalized their healthcare system. Now the reason I bring this anonymous, faceless committee up is the effect they may have on the disabled.  The whole concept of  futility  and  futile care  has been big in ethical circles of late, and this concept is sure to enter into any decisions made by such a committee. The problem becomes when this central committee decides on what constitutes futile care for a particular person.  Instead of a decision being made with the person themself, their doctor, and their family (if the patient cannot communicate), this central committee will make decisions as to whether a particular person's life is worth investing more health care dollars into.   I don't know about you, but I don't have much trust that such a committee won't have an inbred bias against the disabled.  Society as a whole is biased against the disabled, but society as a whole up to now hasn't been able to out and out condemn individuals to die from lack of treatment.  Such a committee will. For those of you that will disagree with me, ask your legislator if he/she can guarantee you that no disabled person will be denied care based on their disability.  They can't. Also one last thought for tonight.  The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office predicts that millions of Americans will be forced out of their present insurance plans by the institution of Obamacare, and force into the \"public option\".  The most telling thing (IMO) regarding the public option is that both the House of Representatives, as well as the President himself tonight, refuse to include themselves in the public option.  The President waffled tonight when asked whether he would submit himself to the same requirements as the public option.  The House last week voted down an amendment to the health care bill which would have required House members to take the public option. If they don't want that option for themselves, why is it good enough for millions of other Americans?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SmfUjDI9s4I/AAAAAAAAAuI/XgO8SzI3WFI/s1600-h/stethoscope2", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/irinaslutsky/2188999389/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://www.notdeadyet.org/docs/TXfutilecarelawPR0506.html", "http://www.nrlc.org/news/2001/NRL08/wes.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/07/obamacare-and-disability.html", "title": "\nObamacare and Disability\n"},

Liz made up this amazing booklet for each of the kids on this trip.  She got clip art from various places, pictures of things we were going to visit, and little blurbs that she put together so that the kids could read a bit about what we were going to do before we got there.  She made sure that the stuff she wrote was age appropriate, as well as short enough to be interesting.  Liz also left some blank pages for the kids to draw or paste souvenirs in.  I was pretty impressed. Liz also read a lot of stories with the kids before we left that dealt with where we were going.  As well as rounded out her \"priming\" of them with a few multi-media presentations (songs and videos). One of her songs that she was playing for them before we left was \"The Erie Canal\".  Rather than just reciting to them when it was built, how long it was, who was Governor when it was built, etc., she really did a pretty good job of making this stuff interesting.  We talked about locks, how they worked, the importance to river traffic to trade in the 1800's, etc. When we got close to the canal, we were singing the song, and we realized that Buddy Boy had gotten one of the words wrong.  We've all done this at one time or another (some of us more often than not), so it was no big thing.  But he insisted for the longest time that his version was right, and he didn't want to change it. The original chorus goes: Low bridge, everybody down Low bridge for we're coming to a town And you'll always know your neighbor,  you'll always know your pal If you've ever navigated on the Erie Canal. Well, Buddy Boy insisted the third line was: And you'll always know your neighbor,  you'll always know your  pal   cow Given that he still talks about wanting to be a farmer, I guess it's good to \"always know your cow\".

{"date": "Sunday, July 26, 2009", "body": "\n photo credit- atomicshark creative commons license Well, we're off, on what promises to be a great vacation (holiday).  We had a mostly good day, with but a small (but typical) interchange at the motel pool after we checked in. The pool was packed, and noisy.  There were kids everywhere.  Buddy Boy and Sweet Pea jumped right in, swam around some, and seemed to be having fun. As I was watching Buddy Boy, he approached a group of kids at one end of the pool.  It was apparent that they all knew each other, and were goofing around with each other a bit.  Buddy Boy pretty much just inserted himself in the middle of the group and tried to start interacting with them.  I couldn't hear what was being said, but then it appeared that (perhaps) they were engaging him and including him in their goofing around.  Then I noticed a bit of shoving going on, and the next thing I know Buddy Boy's being shoved a bit forcefully by one of the kids.  It turns out that after getting pushed lightly a bit, Buddy Boy kicked him in the groin below the surface of the water.  I guess I'd be upset, too.  By this time I could tell that something was definitely wrong, and Liz started towards that end of the pool to see what was up (I asked Liz to go, because there were a group of mothers down there, and I thought that perhaps a female touch would go over better than me going down there).  Before she gets there the mom of the other boy is pointing at Buddy Boy and shouting that Buddy Boy kicked her son in his private parts (and of course the pool gets pretty quiet, and everyone turns to pay attention). Buddy Boy, having been shoved a bit hard, comes out of the pool crying loudly.  So now the other mother is starting to shout, and Buddy Boy is getting louder.  Liz pulled the \"A\" card (you know, sometimes my son overreacts a little, he's autistic).   Amazingly, it worked.  The other mother abruptly stopped, said she understood, and sat back down.  We quieted Buddy Boy down, and the kids got back to playing in the water. Liz says that this incident was pretty typical for Buddy Boy, when he doesn't have someone right by his side facilitating his interactions and intervening.  I must admit that I haven't seen things escalate so quickly in the past (okay, maybe I have  selective memory ), but she sees him more at school, and interacts with his teachers more.  Evidently stuff like this happens during recess at school on a fairly regular basis. Liz and I talked, and we think it's because he just can't read the situation.  He doesn't understand how groups of kids that already know each other don't necessarily want someone else to insert themselves into their group.  He doesn't get their signals when they tell him to nicely get lost.  He doesn't know the difference between gentle playfulness between close friends, and him being a stranger pushing just \"that\" much harder than they are (which then sets them off, to his surprise and dismay, which escalates his response). We've tried explanations (which he doesn't want to listen to-\"I KNOW\"), we've tried a little role playing, which he also doesn't want to partake of.  We coach ahead of time, and I always struggle with how far to let him go on his own.  I don't want him to have bad experiences, but I also know that eventually he needs to learn to navigate on his own (and it  does work , sometimes). I blame myself for tonight.  I should have recognized that the pool was much too crowded, the kids perhaps too tired, and me too lazy to change into a swimsuit and instead sat on the side.  I wish I was a bit more like  Emily .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SmvSSoroHAI/AAAAAAAAAuY/zRwFlUr-hK0/s1600-h/traffic+signal.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/atomicshark/1288380740/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/deed.en", "http://daisymayfattypants.blogspot.com/2009/07/theyre-lucky-to-have-us.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/07/missed-signals.html", "title": "\nMissed Signals\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, August 1, 2009", "body": "\n So, our first stop on our family vacation extravaganza this year was Niagara Falls.  I have been there 2 or 3 times in the past, but not for at least a decade.  And I don't think I've been on the Canada side of the falls for at least 30 years. I was surprised both by how expensive everything was on the Canadian side of the falls, as well as how tacky.  Now don't get me wrong.  The falls themselves are beautiful (breathtaking, really), and the view from the Canadian side is better than from the US side.  But I'm still left wondering whether if it was worth it to go, as the place left somewhat of a bad taste in our mouths. This is what we expected (and got!): The falls are a natural wonder, and the \"Maid of the Mist\" boat ride is worth it, as they get you right up close to the falls. But the town is tacky to the nth degree with Ripley's right next to Frankenstein, next to a horror show, next to a Rock and Roll Wax museum, tacky souvenir shop, etc.  People smoking everywhere (not just the tourists, but a much greater percentage of the locals then I would have expected-I thought Canadians were supposed to be much more progressive.  I guess they're just more \"European\" in this respect). The hotel we stayed at was expensive, and looked like it had been built in the 1970's, with furniture updated once in the 1980's.  The cleanliness was barely passable, the wi-fi didn't work in the room (only in the lobby, though they expressed surprise that it didn't work in the room-a night clerk said it never worked in our room).  One of the mattresses creaked and was lumpier than our 25 year old sleeper sofa at home. Food cost about 80% more, even after adjusting for the exchange rate (ham, mushroom, and cheese omelette at a Perkins restaurant- $8.49 in the states, $14.98 in Canada.  Other stuff even more outrageous).  You would think that the town would look really good, with the prices being charged.  But other than some nice buildings right near the river, the rest of the town is rather shabby looking.   It took us almost 3 hours to clear Canadian customs, and we weren't even singled out for special inspection.  The lines were just that long.  Buddy Boy was waxing poetic in the back seat about what the customs agents might be looking for while we were waiting (bombs, explosives, and terrorists).  Luckily, we persuaded him to clam up while we passed thru the line. Even though the streets were packed, we were told that tourism is off this year due to the economy.  The Canadian people were nicer than most tourist dependent townsfolk.  I think I would be surly if I lived in a town where people tramped thru my front yard every day and asked stupid questions.  One store clerk thanked me for being polite (and I wasn't even trying to be-I can't imagine what she has to put up with on a daily basis). After a couple days of seeing the falls and the surrounding area, we were off to mid-southern Pennsylvania, where we spent the next few days.  Fortunately, we got thru customs going back in about a half hour. All in all, I still would go back to Niagara Falls and the Canadian side.  It's just a shame that such a naturally beautiful place has been degraded by such a tacky town.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SnO-mieDceI/AAAAAAAAAug/2ryFpdtPp3Q/s1600-h/IMG_1957.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SnO_robBGFI/AAAAAAAAAuo/EEtlk6q1zBg/s1600-h/IMG_1995-b.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SnPA4dDaRqI/AAAAAAAAAuw/Hd9SfbaE1mA/s1600-h/IMG_1965-b.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SnPBgQ79u7I/AAAAAAAAAu4/bPSMMEWIH4w/s1600-h/IMG_1962.JPG"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/08/when-did-niagra-falls-get-so-tacky.html", "title": "\nWhen Did Niagra Falls Get So Tacky?\n"},

{"date": "Friday, July 10, 2009", "body": "\n photo credit- mdkiteman creative commons license I saw this story yesterday,  \"Mother Accused of Withholding Cancer Medication from Autistic Son\" , in which a mother of an eight year old autistic son with lymphoma has been charged with neglect for failing to give him his chemotherapy at home. Basically, the child had lymphoma, got his initial chemotherapy, then was supposed to follow up with home chemotherapy and additional follow up appointments, many of which were supposedly missed. Now the tumor has recurred, and is more aggressive, and the child's chance of survival has gone from 90% to 10%. To complicate the situation, in addition to the child being autistic, the parents are going thru what has been described as a \"bitter divorce\", where the father hasn't had recent contact with his son, but has now assumed custody. Orac has a  good post  up on this, but I thought I'd add my take. In ethics, one way of approaching problems where there is conflict is termed the \"4 Principles\" approach. The authors Beuchamp and Childress wrote a  groundbreaking book  on medical ethics in 1979, which is now in its fifth edition. In this book, the authors describe four principles that could be used to assist in deciding questions of medical ethics. The four principles are usually listed as \"autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice\". A fairly good concise overview of these principles can be found  here . Although Beuchamp and Childress never argued that any one principle should be more important than any of the others, in American medicine and ethics circles autonomy has generally been held to be \"first among equals\". What this means is that, generally speaking, a competent adult has the right to refuse any treatment, even if doing so would kill them. As children generally can't decide for themselves what is best for them (especially 8 year olds), their parents are usually given broad leeway in making decisions for them. Historically speaking, however, there are definite limits to this authority. For instance, if a child needs a life saving blood transfusion but the parent's religion doesn't allow for any blood products, then it is routine in children's hospitals for emergency custody to be granted to someone appointed by the state, who will approve the transfusion. This case appears to be similar, but not totally identical, to the case of a blood transfusion. In this case, a relatively simple (but still with arguably potential serious side effects) was withheld from the child by the mother (according to the charges). The question is whether the mother should be able to act on her son's behalf and refuse treatment. Before going further into this, let's go back to the other three principles. Beneficence means doing the best thing for the patient. It would seem obvious that giving the child the chemotherapy would be the best thing. But each adult has the right to refuse treatment, even chemotherapy. And even with the chemotherapy, there would be a 10% chance of dying. A competent person might say that they would rather have a 10% chance of living, and not have to undergo the pain of needlesticks, the constant nausea, hair loss, weight loss, fatigue, etc. But certainly most people would choose to undergo all of these things in order to improve their chances of survival from 10% to 90%. And most of the time, although chemo is still chemo, outpatient follow up treatments generally have a lot less severe side effects than the initial inpatient treatment. Although I often think of  this Disney character  when I hear the word, non-maleficence, what it actually refers to is not harming the patient. The second thing I think of (after the Disney character) is the medical aphorism \"First, do no harm.\" Again, what we balance here is a large potential future harm (recurrence of the tumor, which is what in fact happened) against the immediate harm of undergoing treatment. Perhaps undergoing treatment for this autistic child was particularly difficult. Treatment  may  have included injections of chemotherapy into the spinal canal, and depending on whether they were willing to anesthetize the child for these, it might have been fairly traumatic (even undergoing anesthesia to have it done might be fairly traumatic). So it's not necessarily a total slam dunk when it comes to considering non-maleficence. Finally there's justice, which basically means doing what's fair, as well as what's best for society as a whole. Society benefits from having healthy citizens. And most people would agree that all people deserve to get chemotherapy for a tumor. So I think that most would agree that justice would fall on the side of the child getting chemotherapy. So what we are left with is questions of the mom's ability to speak for the child against the state's interest in having healthy citizens, and beneficence weighing heavily on treating the disease process, as the treatment is mostly safe, though it has some potential bad side effects. I think that most people would treat their child in a situation such as this, which is why people are up in arms, and why charges have been filed. The mother may have a certain degree of ignorance regarding the risks involved, and may also not have a lot of support in her life at the moment (though I know that's no excuse). The father may or not be a \"victim\" in all this. He may share some of the blame for not picking up some of the slack, or may have been actively excluded by his wife. It's hard to tell from outside. In the end it doesn't look forward for the child, but we can all hope for miracles. And I hope that the child's autism did not enter into the mom's equation of whether to withhold treatment or not.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SlaZqHUT0HI/AAAAAAAAAuA/O4yqETFnKAo/s1600-h/IV+pump.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdkiteman/421506697/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,374464,00.html?sPage=fnc/health/neurology", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/why_would_a_woman_withhold_chemotherapy.php", "http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Biomedical-Ethics-Tom-Beauchamp/dp/019508537X", "http://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/tools/princpl.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleficent"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/07/sad-case.html", "title": "\nA Sad Case\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 2, 2009", "body": "\n photo credit- multiplication.com Multiplication tables (as well as most other math facts) have been a hard go for Buddy Boy.  His third grade class started on the \"8's\" and \"9's\" back in March, and he still hadn't gotten them down by the end of the school year.  Liz worked with him, his teachers tried various strategies, but nothing seemed to work.  Every time Buddy Boy had a problem, he had to stop and sequentially add things, or if he was able to remember a rule, he would take minutes to painstakingly work through it step by step. So near the end of school Liz went searching for a new approach, and as soon as school was out, she was ready with some workbooks.  Two of the books were variations on regular math workbooks, but one of them was decidedly different.  This one,  \"Memorize in Minutes: The Times Tables\"  looked rather silly, and I didn't hold out much hope for it. The book has silly pictures (complete with silly stories for each one) to teach the times tables.  The times table above is \"8 x 8 = 64\", and down below it says \"skate x skate = sticky floor\".  The accompanying story describes how two skaters went skating and got stuck to a sticky floor, which was covered with a gooey, sticky, substance.  Huh?  How was a series of stories going to get Buddy Boy to remember his multiplication tables?  Even if he did, I figured it wouldn't save him any time over what he was already doing. It worked. What couldn't be accomplished in months was virtually all memorized in a week.  Buddy Boy and Liz worked their way through the \"8's\" and \"9's\" in a week, and are going back to some of the other numbers.  Buddy Boy demonstrated his now fairly rapid firing off of various multiplication facts.  It was truly amazing.  What had before taken minutes now took about 2 seconds each.  I was impressed. So if you're having similar issues, this might be something you want to look at.  The website's  here .  We paid for our book, and have no financial interest in this product.

There's no waiting for dreaded phone calls, no worrying about academics being shunted aside in favor of watered down \"make work\" or \"compliance\", and little worry about increased stress levels (for all of us). Summer is a time of tending the garden, kids going to camp, taking a vacation (holiday), and neighborhood festivals.  Academics aren't totally left behind, but they're done on our schedule and in light of our kids' needs, not on the school system's.  Liz does a yeoman's job of making sure the kids read (and get read to) each day, and filling the gaps of things they didn't quite get during the school year.  She's even found kids versions of classic books for them to read. Buddy Boy struggles somewhat with math, and Liz has systematically investigated how he processes math problems, and come up with some novel strategies to assist him.  After months of failing to be able to memorize basic multiplication facts (e.g., 6 x 6 = 36), Liz found some workbooks that use stories and rhymes to assist in memorizing math facts.  They seem to be working. But studying is pretty low key, and the kids don't seem to mind a couple of short sessions each day. So what did we do today, when temperatures topped out at 98 degrees Fahrenheit (36.7 Celcius)?  Stay inside, crank up the air conditioning?  No way.  There was a local carnival in a nearby park, and the kids kept asking to go. We didn't stay all that long (it was pretty hot, after all), but the kids had a good time.  Afterwards, we went to a local ice cream parlor for another time honored rite of summer. Sweet Pea had a little trepidation about tackling the ride pictured above (you sit in a seat that goes around and around in a big 50 feet vertical circle), but eventually said that she wanted to do it.  Although she looked a bit scared when it started up, by the end of the ride she loved it.  Buddy Boy went with her, and provided moral support.   Buddy Boy's also been working on jokes lately (everything from \"knock knock\" jokes to puns).  Sometimes they're funny, sometimes they're not, but he's getting much better overall.  When he got off the ride, he walked up to us and said very seriously, \"Call me Ishmael\".

He teaches music, but not Buddy Boy's class.  But Buddy Boy knows him because at the end of the day he comes to Buddy Boy's class to wait for his wife.  While he waits, he usually uses the computer, and trys not to get in the way. Evidently Buddy Boy has decided that Mr. L is autistic.  He told his teacher, Mrs. L, this last week.  \"Why do you say that, Buddy Boy?\" she asked.  \"Well, he spends a lot of time on the computer, doesn't answer my questions when I talk to him, and sometimes is a little grumpy.\"  Mrs. L just replied \"Those are interesting observations.\"  Now Mr. L is a quiet guy, but I hardly think he's on the spectrum.  But since Mrs. L didn't out and out deny that her husband was autistic, Buddy Boy took this as affirmation. So this week Mrs. L is appropriately laying down the rules for Buddy Boy when he wasn't doing something he should, and he comes out with \"Mrs. L, since you are married to someone who is autistic, I would think that you would be a litte more understanding of me!\" Two more weeks until school is out for the kids!  We're counting the days.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Sgy0OEXUrDI/AAAAAAAAAtY/oYEFutXyPio/s1600-h/new+glasses.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/pagedooley/950702935/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Sgy2OsECiPI/AAAAAAAAAtg/s5yi30SKAX0/s1600-h/color+blind+test.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/azdodsons/3216527988/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/deed.en"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/05/i-can-see-clearly-now.html", "title": "\nI Can See Clearly Now\n"},

For those of you who aren't familiar with ADAPT, it is an organization that advocates for the civil and human rights of the disabled. This protest was in support of the CCA, or the Community Choice Act.  If passed, this act would provide much more support for the disabled to live in their own homes, instead of being shunted into institutions (both large and small). The current administration has talked a lot about support for the disabled.  It's time to see if they're willing to support their words with action.  It will take spending some political capital to get lawmakers to sign onto this bill (the disabled, being mostly invisible to lawmakers, are not seen as a significant part of anyone's voting base).  Today's action raises the visibility of the disabled, and may be the nudge that lawmakers need to actually act in their constituents best interest. Instead of having the money flow to people through big agencies and big institutions, the CCA would allow more of the money to follow the individual, such that they could procure assistance in their own home, and remain independent and integrated into their own community. If you're in the US, contact your own legislator and urge them to pass this bill.  For your Senators, the bill number is S. 683.  For your House members, the bill number is H.R. 1670.

The sky was blue and clear, there was a soft breeze, and no humidity.  In short, it was a perfect day.  I happened to get out of work early, and treated myself to a late lunch on an outdoor patio of a nearby restaurant. Today I noticed all sorts of flowering plants, bushes, and trees springing up all over the place.  Lillies, redbud, dogwoods, and one of my favorites, the forsythia shown above.  The forsythia always seems to just start to peak around Sweet Pea's birthday, which is coming up shortly (she'll be 7). I'll always associate forsythia with Sweet Pea, as this riotous yellow flowering bush was in full bloom when we went to attend her birth in the city she was born in, and fully in bloom a few weeks later when we brought her back home. Somehow the explosive, in your face color that screams \"Notice Me!!\" and \"I'm So Cute!\" seems thoroughly appropot of our daughter.  Sweet Pea is always full of energy, and she is always noticed when she enters a room (whether you'd like her to be or not).  Although Sweet Pea is often a bit too loud, a tad too competitive, and a bit too demanding at times, I love her spunk.  She has the drive and determination that, when harnessed a bit with maturity, will serve her well in life.   Although a lot of my blogging has to do with Buddy Boy, I just wanted to take a minute and give my second child (the one who I tell every night \"You're my favorite girl in the whole wide world\") a little bit of ink, too.

{"date": "Monday, March 2, 2009", "body": "\n photo credit- Shutr creative commons license There are two old sayings that come to mind when I think of seclusion rooms.  One's an old Japanese saying-\"The nail that sticks up get's hammered down.\"  The other one's a saying that's commonly used in surgery-\"When all you've got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\"   I think that both of these principles have come to govern the use of seclusion and restraints in special education.  For too many years, in too many places, children who have occasional outbursts in schools have been seen as disruptions, nuisances, drains on resources, undisciplined, bad, and generally problems to be controlled.  And the tools that have been most often resorted to to remedy the situation have been the ones seen to be most expedient-the use of restraints and seclusion rooms. It was recognized  over 50 years ago  in psychiatric hospitals that use of seclusion rooms and restraints increased, rather than decreased, the incidence of behaviors.  Why, then, does the use of these rooms persist into modern times in schools? People must use them because they believe it's the best alternative.  But what leads them to believe this, and what are the real facts? In  a monograph  written for the Council for Children with Behavioral Disorders written in 2000, Michael P. George, the author and a special educator, refers to potentially damaging assumptions that he believes are present amongst special educators are the following: Children with emotional and behavioral disorders (E/BD) come from bad homes, and since we cannot change the homes, we cannot succeed with the children in our schools. Children with E/BD are incapable of controlling their behavior or regulating their emotions, and it is up to us, the professionals, to control them. Most children and youth with E/BD are so aggressive and violent they can be educated only in very restrictive settings. The more serious the misbehavior of the children and youths under our care, the more intrusive and severe our methods must be in treating them. Seclusion time-out and physical restraint are necessary interventions for the most serious and intractable of these youths. He then asks the obvious question of how those beliefs guide practices and methods, and concludes that many in the field accept the use of seclusion and restraints because they are believed to be effective.  Meanwhile, the obvious side effects of using violence to treat violence (anger, resentment, fear, resistance, feelings of hate, and even death) were being ignored. George then describes how the culture of the school was changed, which resulted in a year to year difference of a decrease in the use of physical restraints by 69%, and a decrease in the number of minutes spent in seclusion by 77%. Ryan et al., in an study entitled  \"Reducing the Use of Seclusion and Restraint in a Day School Program\" , describes how  The majority of students placed in seclusion during both school years came from elementary and middle school. High school students were rarely placed in time-out during either year (10.7% and 12.4% respectively). Restraints were also performed much more frequently among younger students during both years. During the 2002\u20132003 school year, the preponderance of all restraints (80.9%) were performed on elementary students. Students in middle school were much less likely to be restrained (14.7%), while high school students rarely (4.4%) experienced this procedure. During the second year, the elementary grades still represented the majority (67.9%) of all restraints performed, while no restraints were performed on high school students.   The median age of those placed in seclusion was 13, while the median age of those restrained was 8, even though the study group included children up through high school (approximately 18 years of age).  He attempts to explain these findings thru positing the following possibilities:   1. their possessing fewer mechanisms for coping with frustration,  2. staff may believe intrusive procedures may be more developmentally appropriate for younger children, or  3. that staff may be apprehensive to perform these procedures on larger and stronger individuals.  Whatever the reason, it seems apparent that it's generally considered OK to restrain and abuse kids in special education, especially when they're young.   Dr. Stuart Ablon, Associate Clinical Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts (yes, the same state that houses the  Judge Rotenberg Center ) is the Director of a program called  \"Think:Kids\"  in the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital.  This program espouses collaborative problem solving (CPS) with kids who have behavior problems, instead of the use of restraints and seclusion rooms.  As one might expect from the name, CPS helps kids and adult caretakers work together to resolve problems in a mutually satisfactory manner.  They try to identify specific cognitive skills that individuals lack (executive skills, emotional regulation skills, social skills, etc.) and find ways to teach them. Unlike the assumptions cited above that special educators often have, they teach a different approach based on respect and collaboration.  This approach was first laid out by Dr. Ross Greene in the book  \"The Explosive Child\" .  Dr.'s Ablon and Greene collaborated on another book on the subject,  \"Treating Explosive Kids\" .  While I'm not too wild about the use of the term \"explosive\" in the titles of these books to describe kids (are they about to literally blow up?) I am all for the philosophy and recommendations they make in their books. I've referred before to how Ange is working hard at a  grassroots campaign  in Missouri against the use of seclusion and restraint rooms.

{"date": "Thursday, May 7, 2009", "body": "\n photo credit- hrtmnstrfr creative commons license In a story on the wire yesterday, a man in Salem, Oregon was arrested and jailed after  shocking his four children with a shock collar  meant to train dogs.  According to the story \"Todd Marcum, 41, said he did it \"because he thought it was funny,\" Salem Police Lt. Dave Okada said. ... Marcum was taken into custody on four charges of first-degree criminal mistreatment. He is in the Marion County jail.\" Now if Marcum had had a lick of sense, he would have just told the police that he thought his children were autistic, and needed some training.  Because he had been on the internet, and he knew that the  Judge Rotenberg Center uses shocks  to control autistic kids.  And it's perfectly legal.   Other states even send their autistic kids to Massachusetts  to the JRC so they can be shocked, too. Marcum could have stated that his children were  swearing, nagging, or flapping their hands , and thus qualified to receive shocks. Now the only problem is that the dog collar that Marcum used was probably a lot less powerful than the one that is routinely used at the JRC.  The dog collar is a small, self contained unit, while the JRC devices need a backpack to haul around.  The dog collar will stimulate for up to a half second, while the \"GED\" devices used by the JRC will shock you for up to 2 seconds. I found out while poking around that dog collars are subject to  legal regulations , which state (amongst other things) that they can be applied for no more than 12 hours in any 24 hour period, and they can't put out more than 15 milliamps root mean square.  The JRC uses devices that put out an  average  (not maximum) of 15 milliamps RMS, and a  maximum of 45 milliamps RMS  (fully three times as powerful as the maximum allowed for a dog collar). So Marcum, if you or your lawyer are reading this, just claim you were using a tried and tested method of disciplining your kids, who you suspect are autistic (don't forget the autistic part-people might not approve of your behavior otherwise). Perhaps the Massachusetts and New York legislatures would be interested in the torture by electric shocks that is occurring if there were dogs that were being shocked.  Because they haven't been interested when it was only autistic individuals involved.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SgMV8uYIp3I/AAAAAAAAAtQ/9b-e77Je6nA/s1600-h/dog+shock+collar.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/hrtmnstrfr/465647140/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/deed.en", "http://www.statesmanjournal.com/article/20090506/NEWS/905060441/1001", "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2007/08/school-shock", "http://www.aspiesforfreedom.com/showthread.php?tid=4033", "http://74.125.113.132/search?q=cache:KdeXHTQogr4J:www.dpi.vic.gov.au/DPI/nrenfa.nsf/LinkView/13FD529000AA3517CA2575200070203F18CDE14E012AB3A0CA2573FA000E0AC8/%24file/Factsheet%25201%2520-%2520Electronic%2520collars%2520-%2520remote%2520training%2520and%2520anti-bark.pdf+dog+collar+milliamperes&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a", "http://www.aspiesforfreedom.com/showthread.php?tid=4033"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/05/just-claim-they-were-autistic.html", "title": "\nJust Claim They Were Autistic\n"},

It's a great way of connecting with people in your community and across the globe.  It's big enough that there is space enough for every niche interest imaginable.  I also believe that besides connecting with other people, the internet can assist minority groups in advocating for themselves, as happened with protesting the  Ransom Notes campaign . But I also think that the internet has its limitations in effecting change in socieatal attitudes and laws.  My personal feeling is that the internet is one tool in a big handbag of ways that can be utilized to change opinions.  Should we utilize the internet?  You betcha.  But I also think that we should also pursue other avenues whenever they present themselves, as well as combine the internet with other methods to gain greater influence than either method might obtain by itself. The other day I blogged how  Ange Hemmer  is  working to change practices  in Missouri schools.  She has used the internet to gather parent testimony, but she has also spent countless hours on the phone and in person talking to legislators, state advocates, and reporters, generating  several stories  in the  media  that have probably gotten at least some people to reconsider their inner feelings regarding those who are different in society.  She's even starting to get some  results . Today I'd like to highlight a young autistic filmmaker named Drew, who's film, \"Treasure Diversity\" is being screened at the Beloit International Film Festival. Though the film is only 10 minutes long, the film festivals executive director, Rob Beaudoin said \"There is a magic to this film that caused me to think differently about people and about life.\"  After viewing the trailer, I am sure that his reaction is not unique.  In addition to being screened at BIFF, Drew's film has been screened not only at other US film festivals, but also festivals as far away as Australia.  Not too shabby for a 12 year old kid.  His 10 minute movie has the potential to reach thousands, if not tens of thousands of people.    I think we all need to look for opportunities to make a difference in other people's attitudes.  We might not be filmmakers, or be able to make the time to travel to our state capitals to lobby legislators, but we all can take the time to write our lawmakers and let them know how we feel, as well as educate people we come into contact with every day.

Perhaps it's because the weather's been warmer the last couple of days.  Perhaps there is absolutely no reason at all, but today Buddy Boy had a major meltdown at school (actually two incidents). In the morning he got upset about something relatively minor, went to his spot in the class to calm down, then got more upset and was sent to the principal's office, where he calmed down after an hour or so.  After lunch and recess, he got upset in math class, jumped on a chair and then a desk, bit himself really hard (he says he didn't want to be agressive against anyone else), then when he was being taken for a walk in the hall started head butting the brick wall.  When another teacher started to intervene to try and prevent him from hurting himself, he head butted her.  Liz was called and picked him up. He seemed fairly normal for the rest of the afternoon, completing much of the work he missed by being taken out of school, and expressing remorse over his actions. Last year Buddy Boy had a  bad Spring , which started getting really bad in April, and continued thru May.  Like last year, we got lulled into a false sense of security, as everything has been going fairly well for all of us.  Now Liz has catapulted herself to Defcon 2, and seemed to be having a flashback from last year when I got home.  She was poring over last year's calendar (where she wrote all of last year's problems, observations, med changes, etc.) looking for some inspiration or answer to get us thru this.  She found nothing.  We wonder out loud if the fact that his class size has gone from 18 at the start of the year to 23 now has changed the dynamic sufficiently to cause such a change.  We've had people come in to observe before when Buddy Boy's had problems (the school will let outside \"professionals\" in to observe, but not parents), but it's hard for someone that doesn't know Buddy Boy's baseline to get a handle on what's happening in a few short hours.

While I don't know a whole lot about the intricacies of the game, I knew it was animated and that there really wasn't any violence to it.  I quickly convinced her that it was basically harmless, and might lead to some spontaneous social interaction. Well, we got him the cartridge for his 9th birthday last month, and he's been playing it ever since. This afternoon, as I was getting ready to go pick up Sweet Pea from her third birthday party in as many weeks, Liz informed me that a boy from Buddy Boy's class was coming over to play.  She also told me that  THE OTHER BOY HAD ASKED BUDDY BOY IF HE COULD COME OVER!!! You could have knocked me over with a feather. Evidently this other boy has always been interested in, and nice to, Buddy Boy since he transferred to this school two years ago, and inserting Pikachu and his friends into the mix provided enough commonality that this other boy wanted to spend more time with Buddy Boy.  While Buddy Boy has had a few parent instigated play dates in the past (none in the last 3 years or so), he's never had a \"kid instigated\" play date.  This was HUGE. The kids seemed to get along relatively well.  They played together for a while, then I took them to the park, where Buddy Boy tended to want to dig holes with a stick rather than playing tag, but once they got back home they got back to playing together again.  I think both of them had a good time, which counts as a raving success in my book.

{"date": "Friday, January 2, 2009", "body": "\nMy wife tells me not to jump to conclusions, but I'm very suspicious right now. John Travolta's 16 year old son, Jett,  has died  while on vacation with his family in the  Bahamas.  According to TMZcom: ... Jett was last seen going into the bathroom at their private suite at the Old Bahama Bay Resort sometime yesterday. The body was discovered by the caretaker, Jeff Michael Kathrein (pictured bottom right with Travolta in 2006), at 10:00 AM today. The report says Jett suffered from seizures. ... Jett was widely rumored to be autistic, though the Travolta's denied this, and said instead that he had Kawasaki syndrome (an autoimmune disease that can lead to heart disease).  Being autistic is something that is seen as a defect by Scientologists, which is the \"religion\" that the Travoltas belong to. My immediate questions are: 1) Why was a 16 year old unaccounted for from yesterday evening to 10:00 am this morning?  What adult was responsible for him? 2) Did Jett have a documented seizure disorder? 3) What medicine was he on, and who gave it to him (i.e., did he have proper blood levels of the drug)? 4) Was Jett undergoing any \"detoxifying\" treatments while he was in the Bahamas?  Could chelation leading to a chemical inbalance have caused the seizure? I'm not jumping to conclusions.  But I hope that this unfortunate death is  fully  investigated, and the truth is made public.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tmz.com/2009/01/02/john-travoltas-son-dies/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/01/what-happened-jett-travolta-dies.html", "title": "\nWhat Happened??!!

{"date": "Monday, December 29, 2008", "body": "\n photo credit- Matthew Oliphant creative commons license The traditional New Year's song, Auld Lang Syne begins, Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  and never brought to mind? One might think, from the scarcity of my posts these last few months, that I had forgotten all of my blogging friends and acquaintances. You have all remained in my thoughts (and sometimes in my prayers), but I am certainly guilty of letting this blog lay fallow like a field in winter.  So in the tradition of the season, I'll recap a little of what's been happening this past year. I'll start with last December.  Remember the  Ransom Notes  campaign?  I thought this campaign (actually the response to it) marked a significant moment in autism advocacy.   Ari Ne'eman and ASAN  coordinated a successful effort by a wide spectrum of groups and individuals to quash an ad campaign in New York City that demeaned autistics and others.  Online advocacy successfully crossed over to \"real world\" results, which totally rocked! January was a quiet and happy time for us.  Buddy Boy had a family  John Deere  themed party, followed by a successful  \"Mad Science\" party  with kids from school.  It was a great start to the year. March was when the  Poling case  entered the news.  I was mightily disappointed by the verbal musings of the father in this case, Jon Poling.  As a physician (and a neurologist) he could have taken the opportunity to point out that his daughter's case of being \"vaccine injured\" was a rare anomaly, instead of spouting off with unproved suppositions that there were thousands of cases like her out there.  Perhaps his comments were only rehashing ones made by his lawyer, Clifford Shoemaker, who was at the Poling's side at their press conference. Speaking of Shoemaker, in April he served a ridiculous subpoena against  Kathleen Seidel , who fought back with all the force and tenacity of a superhero librarian.  Shoemaker eventually was disciplined for this with a slap on the wrist.  Still, it was good to see the \"good guys\" win. The mind is a funny thing.  Before going thru my old posts to put this together, I had  completely  forgotten the  trouble Buddy Boy had  in school last Spring.  Reading my post brought all of my feelings from the time bubbling back to the surface.  Last year was the first year that Buddy Boy was pretty much fully included in a regular classroom.  It started off great, but deteriorated in the Spring to a combination of chaos and mayhem.  If not for the understanding and forbearance of his teachers and the administration at his school (as well as Liz's immediate support when necessary), Buddy Boy might have been forced to leave his school.  I'm not sure where we would be this year if they hadn't stuck with him when the going got tough last year. This year has again started out great, and  continues so  thus far, with Buddy Boy in a class where a regular ed and special ed teacher are \"co-teaching\" this year.  Only a few minor speed bumps have been encountered.  After looking back at what happened last Spring, we'll be ready (or as ready as we can be) for any recurrences this year. April is also when I attended a talk by the \"philosopher\"  Peter Singer , who advocates that parents should be able to dispose of (kill) any child they don't want, especially defective ones, until they are several months old (or older, if they are disabled).  Eugenics has never really died out in the world.  Advances in genetics and prenatal testing are just allowing it to be practiced largely out of public view nowadays, as prospective parents of children with Down Syndrome are encouraged to abort their children before they are born.  Unfortunately, we can expect the same response when prenatal tests for other conditions, such as autism, become available.  I credit attending this lecture as one of my prime motivators for  returning to school  this year.  I just completed my first two courses in bioethics (did I mention that I got \"A's\" in both classes?).  Evil (especially polite, well-spoken evil) should never be left to stand unopposed.   The mentioning of Singer reminds me that one of his most erudite opponents,  Harriet McBryde Johnson , died this year.  Although I never met her, her loss is one that was a great one to the disability rights community, and one that I felt deeply.  If we all became half as good an advocate as she was, the world would be a better place. May also found the  Judge Rotenberg Center  in the news  again , as revelations of repetitive electric shocks to \"students\" triggered by prank phone calls proved outlandish enough to get the media's attention (all of the repetitive shocks to students for minor infractions such as talking back or not being neat evidently aren't enough to stir a media response any more).  Supposedly the JRC is having its  practices reviewed  by the state of Massachusetts thru this December, but I haven't seen any official site saying this, and haven't heard any other recent actions taken against the JRC.  Perhaps 2009 will finally be the year that the general public pays attention to the atrocities that routinely take place at the JRC, and close the place down. Summer was great for us.  Buddy Boy continued to make strides in  conversing with , as well as  socializing with , other people.  He even showed the first inklings of  becoming his own advocate  at one point.  Sweet Pea got her first taste of freedom as she  lost her training wheels  this year. Summer also found us getting physical, as we cleared and planted a  garden , and later reaped what  we had sown  (the parts that the moles hadn't cleared out, anyway).  Our  final harvest  was a pumpkin for Halloween. The political scene in the U.S. was certainly an exciting one this year. It was at least somewhat ironic that the majority of the disability community did not support a ticket that had a physically disabled person on the top of the ticket, as well as the  mother  of a developmentally disabled person as the VP.  Barack Obama has promised a lot to the disability community.  I hope that he can deliver on half of what he has promised, and wish him well. This holiday season finds me thankful for all the people that made it down to our house for Christmas this year.  We got a call on the 23rd from an ER nurse two states away from us.  \"I'm xxx, and I'm calling on behalf of (my sister), who just wants you to know that she's all right after the accident\". Accident???!!! A semi-truck had swerved a bit on some ice in front of her, and she had swerved a bit reflexively to try and avoid hitting the truck.  She avoided the truck, but lost control of her own vehicle, and ended up going into the ravine between the highway lanes, up the other side, flying (literally) for 30 feet in the air, and ending up in the opposite ditch.  Other than being banged up and looking like a cross between a raccoon and a Klingon (black eyes and a big hematoma in the middle of her forehead extending down into her nasal region) she was fine.  Needless to say, her vehicle was totaled. I drove down (thru blinding sheets of freezing rain) to make sure she was OK, spent the night there, and drove back with her up to our place the next day.  Having that happen sure makes you appreciate the mundane things in life, and keep you from lamenting the things you might have gotten from Santa. So that's about all that's been happening from the Club 166 point of view this year.  I've signed up for two more courses this coming semester (Law and Bioethics and Justice in Health Care).  I'm sure that once classes start up, I'll be mostly absent again. Happy New Year to one and all!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SVjrliFUjEI/AAAAAAAAAqY/xhiYh8BznEI/s1600-h/Janus.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/fajalar/384418069/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/deed.en", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=23", "http://www.charleston.net/news/2008/jun/05/harriet_mcbryde_johnson_dies43458/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Rotenberg_Educational_Center"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/12/janus.html", "title": "\nJanus\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, November 30, 2008", "body": "\n There are many more important things that I could (and should)  be blogging about, but this amazed me so much I just  had  to write about it.  My sister came to stay with us from out of state for the Thanksgiving holiday.  While we were preparing our back room upstairs for her to stay in, Liz noticed that the walls had some \"stuff\" on them. \"What is that?\", she said.  Sweet Pea, ever the helpful one, said \"Looks like poop!\"  \"What is it?\" Liz says again, a bit more stridently.  \"It's smeared all over the place.\" Buddy Boy chimes in \"That's from the fly paper.\" My heart sinks a little.  The fly paper. A couple of weeks ago we had thousands of flies swarming outside of our house for a couple of days.  We called an exterminator, who assured us that this was common this time of year, and that they would go away with the first frost.  Needless to say, a couple dozen made their way into the house.  Buddy Boy insists that any insect must be returned to it's environment if we won't let him keep it as a pet ( Andrea  would love this kid), and Sweet Pea seems to think that any insect has the power to kill her instantly, and is thus terrified of them. Faced with the prospect of dealing with both of them, I looked for a way to eliminate the problem.  I looked thru our pantry and found a couple of rolls of flypaper.  Thinking this might work, I put one up in the back room.  Liz had me take it down a couple of days later after it became apparent that the unique sticky surface attracted curious kids more than it did flies.  I didn't notice at the time that they had managed to smear some of the sticky stuff on the cream colored walls (which we don't have matching paint for). Now, with 24 hours before my sister shows up, I was tasked to \"Take care of that!\" Realizing that I didn't want to make a bad situation worse, I resolved to get the icky brownish yellowish stuff off the wall without destroying the paint (I did  not  want to have to paint a wall before she arrived).  So I proceeded carefully. First, I started with a rag with dishsoap on it.  I scrubbed carefully and increasingly harder for over 20 minutes.  I got some of it off, but most of it stayed where it was. Like a philosopher progressing steadily up thru  Maslow's pyramid of human needs , I tried what I viewed as successively more potent materials on the wall. The next material I tried was a floor and tile cleaner.  I tried it carefully on an out of the way spot to make sure it wouldn't ruin the paint, then had at it again for another 20 minutes.  Again, it left most of it where it was, only it turned what remained a darker shade of gray.  Getting exasperated, I retreated to the mud room and tried some pine based floor cleaner, again to no avail.  This was starting to get to me.  I finally decided to go for the big guns-a scouring pad and kitchen cleanser-realizing that I would have to be very careful and would still probably remove some paint. Luckily Liz saw me at that point and asked what I was doing.  Fortunately it had been long enough that she had lost most of the fire out of her eye, and recommended the Mr. Clean magic sponges kept under the kitchen sink. With little hope for successful resolution of the problem at this point, I took the sponges to task.  I moistened one and started scrubbing lightly.  And after spending more than an hour trying to get the stuff off, it started lifting off immediately.  What's more, the paint underneath seemed totally unharmed.  In five minutes I was done with those spots, and gleefully going after other spots (finger prints, putty, crayon marks, etc.). \"There's some rockin' chemist out there that hit one out of the park with this!\", I said.  Life is full of small miracles, and I experienced one this week.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/STINbIn1UcI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/yWkV8fWeQhU/s1600-h/eraser_extra_power_product.jpg", "http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/", "http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.shkaminski.com/Classes/images/Maslow.gif&imgrefurl=http://www.shkaminski.com/Classes/Handouts/Maslow.htm&usg=__CzQ5vjC_Chp7fuCOiX_25fclfms=&h=426&w=472&sz=7&hl=en&start=5&um=1&tbnid=ejIfiDbABZBX6M:&tbnh=116&tbnw=129&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dmaslow%2Bneeds%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DX"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/11/clean-sweep.html", "title": "\nClean Sweep\n"},

It's one of my favorite holidays, because it remains one of the holidays that is least tainted by commercialism.  We get to sit down, have a good meal with family and/or friends, and reflect a bit on all that we are thankful for (it doesn't hurt that I LOVE turkey, stuffing, and pumpkin pie). We're now far enough into the school year for me to say that Buddy Boy's teachers, indeed his whole school, are bigs thing I'm thankful for.  This year has been going  GREAT !  Buddy Boy's school instituted a model of teaching this year called \" co-teaching \".  I'm not sure if it's the model or the individuals involved (or both), but it has been working out very well. Basically, co-teaching is when a heterogeneous class of students is taught by both a gen ed teacher and a special ed teacher.  One usually takes on the role of being the \"content\" specialist, while the other becomes the \"process\" specialist.  Like all new things, we were a little anxious regarding how this would work out for Buddy Boy, but it has succeeded grandly. Both of Buddy Boy's teachers volunteered to co-teach.  One of them is a special ed teacher, and the gen ed teacher is actually currently pursuing her master's in special ed, so is open to doing things in non-conventional ways.  The model seems to work for a number of reasons: -the presence of two certified teachers decreases the student-teacher ratio -rather than teaching of kids with special needs devolving down to the para-professionals during busy times during the day, there is a certified teacher to actually teach the kids. -special ed kids are more likely to stay in their home classroom for larger portions of the day, rather than being parceled out to other venues. -because it is voluntary, both teachers are enthusiastic about the model. -even the kids that aren't identified as special ed get extra help when they need it. The principal of the school also has a special ed background, and welcomed us with open arms when we transferred to this school two years ago.  Everyone in the place knows Buddy Boy, and he is well liked by the teachers and staff. I know that Buddy Boy is maturing, and in doing so is able to go with the flow more than he used to.  Though this is a big part of his success, I'm equally convinced that  it has been due in large part to the attitudes that are prevalent in the school and in his classroom in particular.  He still has little incidents (like a couple of weeks ago when he followed another group of kids outside of the school when he was on the way back to his classroom from the school nurse).  But these things are seen (and managed) as little speed bumps along the way, nothing to be concerned about, just things to be dealt with.  His teachers celebrate his successes, instead of his shortcomings. I'm a real thankful guy.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SSt9J8xC6eI/AAAAAAAAAqA/2UEtyzP_f04/s1600-h/turkeys.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/heypaul/2449650/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:OcT-M_3P_aIJ:www.ped.state.nm.us/seo/library/qrtrly.0404.coteaching.lcook.pdf+co-teaching&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us&client=firefox-a"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/11/being-thankful.html", "title": "\nBeing Thankful\n"},

Well, the Port St. Lucie school district finally made a decision on Wendy.  According to the  TC Palm : While school district internal investigators said there's no evidence Morningside Elementary teacher Wendy Portillo meant to cause harm or embarrassment to Alex Barton, they said in a report released Thursday there is a question as to her judgment. Additionally, the article noted: The St. Lucie County School Board voted unanimously Tuesday night to suspend Portillo without pay for one year. Her attorney notified the School Board in a letter that Portillo intends to contest Lannon's recommendation with the state's Division of Administrative Hearings. So after 6 months of investigating, this is what they came up with.  It's certainly less than I would want for someone who psychologically traumatized a 5 year old child, but if she moves on and gets a job somewhere else it will be worth it. The report by the school also said: The incident could cause Portillo to lose the respect and confidence of her colleagues, students, parents and the public, the report said, citing the extensive national and local coverage of the incident. I don't think Portillo could lose much more respect in the public eye, though in checking the comments on that story 2 out of 6 still support her. There are a lot of great teachers out there.  Buddy Boy has two of them this year in his class.  But when anyone abuses 5 year olds, (especially when they are in a position of authority and trust) then that person needs to be called out.

{"date": "Thursday, August 21, 2008", "body": "\n photo credit- kingnixon creative commons license In preparing for our recent cross country vehicular jaunt (i.e., vacation/holiday) I faced a bit of an ethical dilemma.  The US National Parks Service offers a  variety of different passes  that are valid for admission to all national parks and forests.  Besides these annual passes, it is also possible to purchase access for a limited period of time (usually 7 days) for a discounted amount. I had been vaguely aware of the Access Pass from a local autism online group.  The Access Pass gives free lifetime admission to the parks to those with permanent disabilities (along with up to 3 other people traveling with them in the same non-commercial vehicle).  I hadn't thought about it much, but now took the time to consider it. Was Buddy Boy  permanently  disabled?  I have taken the tack of presumed competence, and thus proceed assuming he will continue in school, get a job, and be able to live independently.  Would I be \"giving in\" if I had him labeled as having a  permanent  disability?  Would I be lying to myself from here on out if I said I was presuming competence, but at the same time presenting a card that said that Buddy Boy was permanently disabled? When we first knew that Buddy Boy was different, I had at least moderate resistance to placing any sort of a label on him.  What advantage would it confer?  And at what cost?  At first I thought that the costs of placing any sort of label on him (ostracism, bullying, presumed incompetence by the schools) far outweighed the potential advantages (identity, and knowing he was not bad, just different).  In fact, if we could have obtained educational supports for him without publicly labeling him, I might have continued to lobby for such an approach.   I have no problem with Buddy Boy knowing he is autistic.  We treat it as a matter of fact thing around our house (much like we treat the fact that he joined our family thru adoption).  I do wonder, though, about future implications of him having his name in official databases with a label next to it.  Will it affect future employment opportunities?  We cannot always predict unexpected outcomes from decisions we make. In the end, my decision on whether to get an Access Pass for Buddy Boy was based on pragmatics.  I first consulted the National Parks  FAQ's  regarding the pass.  According to this site: Who qualifies for the Access Pass? The pass may be issued to U.S. citizens or permanent residents that have been medically determined to have a permanent disability that severely limits one or more major life activities. A permanent disability is a permanent physical, mental, or sensory impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing,  learning , and working. (emphasis added) Surely Buddy Boy's ADHD and autism qualified him as having a learning disability (the powers that be certainly thought it severe enough to  kick him out of his regular classroom  and place him for awhile in a class for emotionally disturbed kids).  As to whether his autism and ADHD will affect his learning permanently, the experiences of adults on the spectrum would certainly seem to bear this out.  While people develop various \"work arounds\" as they mature, they don't magically learn not to be autistic as they get older. That left the question of tracking him in a central database.  A little asking around revealed that they don't record a Social Security number with the name, so there's no way that they can track these passes and merge them with other databases.  Finally, as Buddy Boy gets older, it can always be his decision whether he uses the pass or not. So we went with the pass.

{"date": "Monday, August 4, 2008", "body": "\n Are we?? Who can figure out which state in the Continental U.S. we are in? This is a contest.  But as I am a cheapskate, on the road, and am figuring this out as I go along, I don't have anything to give away.  So for the prize, for the first one to figure out where we are, I'll e-mail you some scenic views from our vacation (holiday). Tonights clue is the picture up on top.  If someone doesn't figure it out in 24 hours, I'll edit this post and add another clue. ---------------------------------------------- edit The first guess.   The first guess! OK, Do'C got it on the first try.  We actually spent the first night of our vacation in Iowa, but with apologies to any Iowans out there, I didn't take any pics that first night (though the kids and I did find a family of toads outside the motel while Liz was checking in). Our second night was spent in South Dakota (we didn't stay in Sturgis, we actually stayed a few miles down the road in Spearfish).  But that didn't matter, as the annual  Bike Rally in Sturgis draws 500,000 (!) people on their bikes (mainly Harley Davidson's) to South Dakota.  Our first inkling that our vacation coincided with Bike Week was in trying to make reservations.  Liz found that most motels (single rooms in 2 star nothing special places) were going for $300/night!!!  I was like \"What!!  We're not talking New York City, this is South Dakota!\"  We soon found the reason, and eventually found a room for just over $200/night, which still hurt. There have been Harleys everywhere!   And amazingly, the kids don't see anything abnormal with this.  Today we saw the Corn Palace in Mitchell, SD (it's a building that is covered in-you guessed it-corn!  Quite a-maize-ing, actually), As well as stopped at Wall Drug for \"Free Ice Water!\" as well as ice cream. Tonight we've moved on.  For a second prize (reward same as the first) this new location has unique geologic phenomena found in only 4 other places in the world.  For the prize, name the place, AND the 4 other countries where these phenomena are found. -------------------------------------- edit Next clue. Although there are a few scattered in other places, the 4 other countries that have significant concentrations of these geological phenomena that are located in the park we are visiting are Russia, New Zealand, Iceland, and Chile. -------------------------------------- edit Ding, ding, ding, ding! We have our second winner!  Niksmom is right.  We saw Old Faithful erupt today (twice), as a matter of fact. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SJZ7s-rIL4I/AAAAAAAAAds/WjTwtETG4m4/s1600-h/cycles-wall+drug.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SJaYgOTIdMI/AAAAAAAAAd0/twyvnapg01o/s1600-h/IMG_1244.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SJaZCSqVhRI/AAAAAAAAAd8/ZsAtk8_P4aw/s1600-h/IMG_1212.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SJaajmk7xQI/AAAAAAAAAeE/h_Evp_QmBQQ/s1600-h/front+of+Wall+Drug.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SJfdxiQlH6I/AAAAAAAAAeM/c6wyQr1Lqg0/s1600-h/IMG_1290.JPG"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/08/where-in-world.html", "title": "\nWhere in the World...\n"},

{"date": "Friday, August 15, 2008", "body": "\n So, our first full day in  Yellowstone Park  we went to visit  Old Faithful  geyser.  We hung around for the 35 minutes or so until the next eruption, and secured ourself a front row seat so the kids would get a good view.  Afterwards, when asked how he liked it Buddy Boy replied \"I thought it would be bigger\".  He had seen it in videos before we left, and evidently a 100 foot (30 odd meters) tall plume of water with steam in person didn't measure up to what he thought he saw in the video.  But still he liked it, and wanted to stick around until the next eruption. We started walking around the large boardwalk that is in the general area of Old Faithful, and leads to a number of hot springs and other geyers.  While we were walking, we passed another family group who had one young boy who was perhaps 10 years old or so.  Buddy Boy walks up to him and says, ---------------------------- \"Did you see Old Faithful?\" Other Boy (OB): \"Yea, it was great.  Did you see  Castle Geyser ?  It's the one back there.  It's even bigger.\" Buddy Boy (BB): \"Old Faithful will erupt again in about one hour.\" (OB): \"Castle Geyser only erupts once a day.  You have to check the schedule at the ranger station.  It already erupted today.\" (BB):  \"The magma chamber must be close to the surface here.  That water's really hot.\" (OB):  \"The water's over 200 degrees.\" (BB): \"Only special types of bacteria and algae can live in the water.\" (OB): \"Castle Geyser is older than Old Faithful.   You should check the sign by the building over there, so you can see it erupt next time.\" (Voice from mother of Other Boy, who has walked about 100 feet farther down the walk with the rest of her family):  \"Jordan!  We need to go.\" (BB):  \"Wow, you're even smarter than me!\" ----------------------------------------- Now, of course, I have no idea whether Jordan (the Other Boy) was on the spectrum or not.  But I really enjoyed watching the brief exchange between these two young lads.  They both appeared to genuinely enjoy talking to each other.  Buddy Boy does not often hold down conversations with other people (though when he does, it usually involves topics of special interest).  And whether or not Jordan was on the spectrum, there was much recognizable about him-his walk, his speech patterns, the way he kind of looked at Buddy Boy without really looking at him, etc.-that resonated with me and reminded me very much of Buddy Boy. It was also kind of cool how Buddy Boy identified another person (whether randomly or not, I don't know) who shared his interest in geysers.  Buddy Boy was even impressed enough with Jordan that he payed him the ultimate compliment (\"You're even smarter than me!\").  Buddy Boy always insists that he's smarter than I am. Anyway, that's how we spent our first full day in Yellowstone.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SKOCI737GTI/AAAAAAAAAec/UNw2DE5WAqA/s1600-h/IMG_1290.JPG", "http://www.nps.gov/yell/", "http://www.yellowstone.net/geysers/geyser11.htm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Geyser"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/08/when-aspies-meet.html", "title": "\nWhen Aspies Meet\n"},

Buddy Boy went to his psychiatrist's office today, and Liz told Buddy Boy that he had to talk to the psychiatrist, and not just sit there and play with his Nintendo DS.  So Buddy Boy went in there and after a bit said, \"So, are  you like an occupational therapist for the brain?\" \"Not exactly.  I'm actually a child and adolescent psychiatrist.\" \"So do people come to you if they have problems with their brainstem?\" \"No, actually, if they had problems with their brainstem I wouldn't be the right person to help them.\" After a bit, Buddy Boy said, \"I know!  I know!  I know!  Instead of talking, we could just e-mail each other back and forth!\" That's my boy.  He's always  thinking.

{"date": "Sunday, July 27, 2008", "body": "\n Sweet Pea is 6 now.  Last year she briefly expressed the wish to take her training wheels off of her bicycle, so we tried it.  It didn't work out so well (despite putting extra knee, wrist, and elbow pads on her, lot's of encouragement, etc.), so we put them back on. This year she decided that she wanted to try again.  So about 6 weeks ago I lowered her seat all the way down, and helped her glide down the incline on the cul-de-sac next to our home, with her feet out to the sides to keep her balance/keep her from falling.  We did that for two weeks, then I bribed her to put her feet up on the pedals while I started her off and had her glide down the incline. Well, one thing's led to another, and after two trips to a local parking lot with an ever so slight incline to it, I can say that those training wheels are off for good. Sweet Pea still doesn't have quite enough control for a trail or a sidewalk, but she can start herself, turn, and control her bike better every time.  Her confidence (fashion sense?) is such that she refuses the extra protective pads, and her competitive nature on the last outing had her complaining that Buddy Boy was pedaling faster than she was.   Buddy Boy, for his part, was being a great older brother.  He demonstrated various things to her (like how to keep your pedals level while you're turning so they don't catch the pavement and dump you on the ground) and did a good job of keeping far enough away from her so that she didn't feel like she was going to crash into him.  I also took the time with Buddy Boy in the parking lot to work on such skills as looking before you turn, signaling, and pedaling while standing up. I must admit to feeling a bit of a pang during our last outing.  My baby girl is growing up, and we'll never raise a baby again.  Soon she will tire completely of her parents, and be primarily involved with her peers instead of us.  While I have some inner trepidation that Buddy Boy will not be able to live independently, I also fear that Sweet Pea will grow up too fast, and leave too soon.  She already pushes limits constantly, considers herself the center of the universe, and can pout and throw a fit like the hardest core 'tweens around. Meanwhile, summer carries on, with the kids going to day camps and us going to festivals and carnivals.  Life is good.  Soon we will depart on our annual vacation (holiday).  It's really a shame that kids don't realize how good they have it.

Human-frog hybrids reveal autism's secrets  says the headline in The New Scientist magazine article. Human-frog hybrids might reveal the neurological secrets of autism. By fusing cells from the preserved brains of deceased autistic patients with the eggs of a carnivorous African frog called Xenopus, scientists have started investigating the way the brain cells of people with autism behave. ... The creation of chimeras, or combinations of two different species, is not new.  But the creation of animal-human hybrids is a relatively new endeavor.  In 2005 Dr. Eugene Redmond went to the Caribbean to  implant human stem cells  into the brain of African monkeys.  He hoped to get those cells to produce dopamine, and lead to a cure for Parkinson's disease.  In 2007  British regulators approved  human animal hybrid creation to create new stem cell lines.  And now this type of research is coming to California, with little fanfair. ...To see if abnormalities in neurotransmitter signalling also underlie autism, Miledi's team collected brain samples from six deceased autistic patients, aged eight to 39. They fused brain-cell membranes, which house neurotransmitter receptors, together with Xenopus egg membranes. As a control, they did the same thing with brain cells from patients with no history of mental disorder. ... While some, like the  Scottish Council on Human Bioethics , issued cautionary statements regarding this type of research, it would appear that  most of the public goes along  with this type of research, \"if it might improve understanding of diseases.\"   The Danish Council on Ethics has a  nice summary  of some of the issues involved, including whether certain rights would accrue to such chimeras, whether such creations could be owned, and whether they could be killed. Evidently there have been chimeras produced in the U.S. for  some time now , but ethical questions (other than public discussions regarding human cloning) have largely been ignored. I'm not positive that I might not change my mind in the future, but as of now, I would definitely count myself in the camp of being against chimeras, whatever the purpose.  While I am sure that  Peter Singer  would approve, as he sees no difference between humans and other animals, I see a lot of potential problems with blurring the lines of what is human and what is not. Another thing that bothers me about this is that perhaps autistic humans were chosen to do this because they were viewed as diseased and damaged, and not quite human anyway.  Therefore anything would be okay with such a population.  This was never stated anywhere, but just a nagging little thought at the edge of my consciousness. I don't think that \"the ends justify the means\" in the vast majority of circumstances.  Thus I don't believe that the results of unethical studies should ever be published, or used by other researchers as a basis for their own work.  Too many scientists forge ahead to be the first in their field, and don't stop to consider whether what they are doing is right or not.  I think the least we owe ourselves and our descendants is a full and honest discussion of the ethical concerns of such research.  Just because we can do something doesn't necessarily mean that we should.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SIePjMxCf5I/AAAAAAAAAc8/97c83AWPmRc/s1600-h/frog.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/parksy/828682551/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/AutismNews/story?id=5419861&page=1", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/07/new-depths-of-idiocy.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2008/07/vancouver-sun-prints-bigoted-article-on.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=989", "http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14374-humanfrog-hybrids-aid-autism-investigations.html?DCMP=ILC-hmts&nsref=news2_head_dn14374", "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/july-dec05/chimera_8-16.html", "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14191423", "http://www.in-pharmatechnologist.com/news/ng.asp?n=69807-schb-hybrids-chimeras-ethics", "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article2381509.ece", "http://www.etiskraad.dk/sw14963.asp", "http://www.infowars.com/articles/brave_new_world/chimera.htm"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/07/ribbit-from-headlines-aka-kneedeep-in.html", "title": "\nRibbit From the Headlines (aka "},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 16, 2008", "body": "\n photo credit- Avolore creative commons license Well, I did it today.  I registered to go back to school. One would think that after spending most of my adult life in either higher education or advanced training, and after reaching an age where I should be actively planning my retirement, I would have more sense than this.   Perhaps I am addicted to education.  Or is it just  Pomp and Circumstance ? Over the last 2 years my interest in bioethics has increased.  I regularly attend and participate in a monthly ethics conference at my institution, and have done some reading on the subject.  We have discussed such issues as the exhibit of human bodies in  Body World ,  sham surgery , and the  \"Ashley Treatment\" . So I have decided to formally add some credentials to myself in the area of bioethics.   Rather than commit to a full Master's degree at this time, I am starting with a certificate program, in which I will take 4 Master's level 3 hour courses, followed by  participating in a 5 day seminar in Chicago.  If I like it (and still think it's worth the money), I can apply those courses towards a Master's degree in Bioethics, for which I would need a total of 30 hours of coursework, including a thesis. I can't afford to take off work to do this (especially with the cost of college nowadays), so I am going to do this via an online program.  So even though I work and teach about 70 hours/week, I am hoping that this won't interfere too much with my home life. What it very well may interfere with is my blogging.  Summer is kind of hectic around here, so I haven't been doing much blogging lately.  But once I start school in August I suspect that my coursework may keep me offline a fair amount. I've always felt that while blogging was good (both for me as well as for spreading a positive message regarding autism), that we were all most effective when we leveraged our connections on the net to do things in other venues. I am hoping that my writing experience in this blog will assist me as I go back to school, and that my exposure to all of you will help me as I attempt to translate a philosophy of respect for all people back to the medical community, as well as applying that philosophy to ethical questions that occur. So I am not closing down the blog, but don't be surprised if I am even more scarce around here once August rolls around.  Know that I will often sneek peaks at your blogs, and even write some comments when I can. Now, I wonder if I should get myself a cyber backpack to carry my cyber assignments in?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SH50FIe93tI/AAAAAAAAAc0/8oguTuPVSDY/s1600-h/back+to+school.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/52636849@N00/204934333/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXjRFlLey3A&feature=related", "http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/341/13/992", "http://www.ispub.com/ostia/index.php?xmlFilePath=journals/ijlhe/vol5n1/ashley.xml"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/07/old-dog-new-tricks.html", "title": "\nOld Dog, New Tricks\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, June 29, 2008", "body": "\n I have long felt that while supporting Buddy Boy in his socialization skills by taking him to socialization classes was a good thing, that he got just as much good (and perhaps more) from the times I have taken him to  McDonald's Play Places .  When I take him to a Play Place, I try to let him go out and negotiate for himself, just giving him some tips ahead of time, reviewing casually some things afterward, and intervening (and sometimes hightailing it out of there) only as necessary. While Buddy Boy's  great little surprise  the other day is a \"one off\" for now (we're back to standard conversation mode), he did up and demonstrate a skill yesterday I haven't seen him do before. We took our annual outing to our local park's carnival that they hold every year in June.  We have to pass this fair getting to our house, so there's really no way that we can just forget about taking the kids. Buddy Boy has always wanted to go on some of the \"big kid\" rides, and this year he's tall enough to qualify to ride.  We went in the late afternoon.  It was a pleasantly cool day for this time of year around here (about 76F/24C), and while there were some people there, there weren't a lot of older kids there yet (I imagine they all come out after dark, just like we did when we were young). The first ride Buddy Boy wanted to go on was this one \"The Egg\".  It's kind of like a ferris wheel, but you can lock the car so it goes upside down.  Because of the way the seat belt is configured, they won't let you ride it alone.  We happened to run into one of the counselors from his school, who was there with her daughter.  We asked her daughter if she wanted to ride on that ride, and she said yes.  So we had Buddy Boy ask her if she wanted to ride, and they rode it together. Next Buddy Boy wanted to ride on the ride pictured up top that flips you upside down (over and over again-I think it's called \"The Whiz\").  This is neither my nor Liz's cup of tea, and again the ride would not let anyone ride in a car single.  There was no one else waiting to ride, so we told him he could wait for someone else to come along who wanted to ride.  Next came the part that surprised me. Not wanting to wait all day to ride, and seeing a couple of older kids walking by, Buddy Boy started going up to them and asking them if they wanted to ride on this ride with him.  I was flabbergasted.  This was something I've never seen him do.  This is the kid who doesn't know the names of most of the kids in his class (even by the end of the year), who I only  extremely  rarely see approach other kids at school functions and the playground, and hardly says a word if someone approaches him.  Yet he initiated contact, made his wants known, and successfully persuaded another kid to ride with him on the ride (with the other kid supplying his own tickets-no bribe involved).   He not only did this once, he did it again when we returned to \"The Egg\" ride for another go. Now Liz was not as impressed as I was.  She quite rightly pointed out that these interactions were more in line with going up to a shop counter and asking for something (which he has done before), and not really actual give and take conversational socializing, making small talk and all.  But I was impressed none the less. I am reminded of the old joke that is often attributed to Winston Churchill: Churchill: Madam, would you sleep with me for five million pounds? Socialite: My goodness, Mr. Churchill... Well, I suppose... we would have to discuss terms, of course... Churchill: Would you sleep with me for five pounds? Socialite: Mr. Churchill, what kind of woman do you think I am?! Churchill: Madam, we've already established that. Now we are haggling about the price. The fact that (with sufficient motivation) Buddy Boy demonstrates that he'll initiate conversation with strangers (kids his own age, even-much harder for him than adults) gives me hope that he already has the essentials for achieving success in high school and beyond.  I just have to help him identify the right motivation. One other surprise.  While I was getting him into bed he said \"You know that Black girl that I rode the ride with.  It was nice of her to ride with me.  And she was kind of cute.\"  I was amazed.  Someone that wasn't  blond ?  Who would of thought?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SGbtCZCPh6I/AAAAAAAAAbU/N2n1dyAck2k/s1600-h/Rocket.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SGbw2bYjWPI/AAAAAAAAAbc/hSdmix2SS5Y/s1600-h/IMG_1122.JPG"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/06/practical-socialization.html", "title": "\nPractical Socialization\n"},

It was really well done, and quite fascinating.  Did you know that during this time period 20% of the population of New York was African-American?  And that Carolina had twice as many slaves as there were whites?  I never saw any of that in my history books in school. Buddy Boy was doing what he usually does, which is add his own running commentary (actually, it's more like interjecting facts he knows-or thinks he knows-about the subject).  At one point he says \"Mom, I have to tell you what I was going to tell you about before\".  \"Can it wait?\" Liz asked.  \"No, I need to tell you right now.\"  \"Is this something I won't like?\" (we've been working on trying to get Buddy Boy to filter out some of the naughty words he likes to repeat-usually silly stuff regarding genitals and potty humor).  \"No, you'll like it.\"  \"OK, what is it?\" Liz asked.  After a pause Buddy Boy said, \"That's OK, I won't tell you now.\"  \"No, that's OK, (putting the video on pause) you can tell me\".  \"No, mom, I'll tell you later.\"  \"Why don't you want to tell me now?\" \"Because it doesn't have to do with what we're watching\". I was speechless.  This is the kid who loves to ramble and free associate from one subject to the next, and seemingly randomly go back to something he was discussing 3  days ago, and has real problems with taking turns in a conversation.  And he had stopped and considered that maybe it wasn't the most appropriate time to discuss something.  I've  never  been aware that he's done that before!  Ever!   I thought it was way cool.  No out and out prompting, no modeling, just decided to do it himself, out of the blue. After complimenting him on being so thoughtful, we had to find out what he so wanted to tell us.  It had something to do with grapes.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SGMmLkn0GBI/AAAAAAAAAbE/pbUrdKaw4cc/s1600-h/conversation.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/antonymayfield/2255188757/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/06/conversation.html", "title": "\nConversation\n"},

Since autism is but a portion of our lives, I thought I might share a little story of something that happened with Sweet Pea yesterday. Out of the blue, Sweet Pea asked Liz who picked out the stones (headstones) when you were buried.  Now no one's died recently, and I don't think she's watched something about people dying lately (I don't think they kill off characters on the  Cartoon Network ).  So I don't know where this came from.  So Liz responded with our usual \"Why do you ask?\", to which Sweet Pea responded that she wanted to know whether you picked out your own or someone else picked it out for you. Liz responded something to the effect that a person might make arrangements ahead of time to pick one out, but often the person's family picked out the stone for them. \"Well I'm picking mine out right now.  I want a Princess stone.\" I wonder if I should tell her that they can make headstones from pink granite?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SGWP9DyAZcI/AAAAAAAAAbM/fRhgSOHR1OE/s1600-h/princess+headstone.jpg", "http://www.creativedesignheadstones.com/", "http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/06/planning-ahead.html", "title": "\nPlanning Ahead\n"},

For my part, I have selected this one, originally posted on February 25, 2007.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- On Raising Cowboys ...And them that don't know him won't like him And them that do sometimes won't know how to take him He ain't wrong he's just different but his pride won't let him do things to make you think he's right... ------------------------------                     from \"Mama Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to be Cowboys\"                             by Willie Nelson So Yesterday I had occasion to drive 300 miles one way to another city for a function, then after 4 hours, drive back another 300 miles. I was alone, and able to indulge some of my eclectic musical tastes.  I ended up listening to some  Cowboy Junkies , the  Diner Junkies , and  Willie Nelson  (an ex-junkie). Maybe I'm just picking up one of Krisina Chew's habits and  seeing autism everywhere.   But as I'm listening to Willie singing the above song I heard those lyrics, repeated the track again to make sure I heard them right, and the thought occurred to me, \"I'm not raising a son with autism, I'm raising a cowboy\". And I thought (I do a lot of free association and just plain weird thinking while driving long distances alone) \"I wonder if the world would understand my son better, and treat him better, if I just told them he was a cowboy?\" Cowboys have a long tradition in America, and despite a few people using the term \"cowboy\" in a negative sense when referring to President Bush, there is a long and deep tradition of positive attributes being attributed to cowboys.  Mention being autistic, however, and there only seem to be negative stereotypes that come to most people's minds. Cowboys are entrenched in the lore of the United States, with many of them acheiving  legendary  status. Most cowboys were men, but some (like Annie Oakley) were female.  Cowboys were (and are) generally people who don't talk much, and are rugged individualists.  They tend to keep to themselves, and don't much care if others understand them or not. Cowboys have a code of  ethics  that is looked up to so much that some have suggested a  version of it  be used to instill ethical business practices in individuals. I could see it now.  When the school calls to complain about Buddy Boy exhibiting some behavior that doesn't seem to fit the mold they want to put him in, I could just say something like \"You don't understand, he's a cowboy.\"  This would be all that I would have to say to convey to them that my son was different, and in a good way.   Rather than expecting him to conform to arbitrary rules they had set up, they would instantly understand (because of the shared cultural knowledge) that my son was indeed different, and was probably destined for greatness.  As they had a genuine cowboy amongst their midst, they would fall all over themselvs making efforts to individualize their educational efforts, much as all of society caters to celebrities.  They would also expect great things from him, and as  many studies  have shown, when teachers expect great things from students they tend to get them. My apologies to any Europeans reading this.  You'll have to get your own legendary figures to latch on to to get the schools (and society) to  treat you and your kids better.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sandiego.edu/soles/news/?_focus=30536", "http://www.onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/ReEW6CeMu8I/AAAAAAAAADQ/VgpOxNzSINw/s1600-h/800px-Cowboy_1887.jpg", "http://www.maplemusic.com/product.asp?dept%5Fid=2&pf%5Fid=01%2D05&lang=EN", "http://music.msn.com/album/?album=38243052", "http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Willie-Nelson/dp/B00008BXK3/sr=1-2/qid=1172375467/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/103-3428035-2910227?ie=UTF8&s=music", "http://www.autismvox.com/the-meaning-of-autismland/", "http://www.over-land.com/westpers4.html", "http://www.chrisbrocious.com/cowboy.html", "http://www.quarterhorseoutfitters.net/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=1997&Category_Code=QHO_GENERALINTEREST&Store_Code=QHO", "http://www.kidsource.com/kidsource/content4/student.expectations.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/06/rivisitare.html", "title": "\nRivisitare\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 14, 2008", "body": "\n Tim Russert, 1950-2008 Tim Russert, known to most Americans as the host and moderator of NBC's \"Meet The Press\",  died suddenly  today.  He was 58 years old. He was an icon of American journalism, who asked tough but fair questions of politicians of all stripes.  His interviews were always fair, and he never belittled or insulted the people he had on his show.  That's pretty impressive, for someone who did it for almost 25 years. I thought he was just a darn good journalist until I read a book he wrote,  \"Wisdom of Our Fathers \".  I received this book as a Father's Day gift two years ago.  This was a follow on book to one he wrote two years earlier, entitled  \"Big Russ and Me\" .  In this first book on fatherhood Russert talks about his own father, who was a sanitation worker and a truck driver, and what a great dad he was.  The second book (which I received) stemmed from letters regarding fatherhood that Russert had received from readers of his first book.  Russert also sprinkled in some stories regarding his relationship with his own son, Luke. It was obvious from his treatment of the subject of fatherhood that Russert himself was doing a darn good job of being a father himself.  Russert always sprinkled bits about his family into his show and interviews, and it was obvious that he placed great stock on being a good father.  His son liked his dad so much that he had himself tatooed with his father and grandfather's name. Fathers often are overshadowed in the parenting process by mothers (who are, admittedly, extremely important).  I admired the way that Tim Russert reminded people that fathers are important, too.  He served as a good role model for fathers everywhere.  I am saddened by his passing. Russert had just returned from a vacation in Italy with his family, which was to celebrate his son's graduation from college.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SFMCM5LZv5I/AAAAAAAAAaU/8iz6G18prac/s1600-h/tim_russert_hi.jpg", "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25145431/", "http://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Our-Fathers-Lessons-Daughters/dp/1400064805", "http://www.amazon.com/Big-Russ-Me-Father-Lessons/dp/B000ETQPX8/ref=pd_sim_b_img_1"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/06/great-father-dies.html", "title": "\nA Great Father Dies\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 21, 2008", "body": "\n The school year started out great, but got a bit stressful at the end.  Fortunately the corollary to \"All good things must come to an end\" is \"All bad things must also come to an end\".  So the year ended, and we have been getting back on an even keel. I am descended from a long line of Eastern European farmers.  My ancestors were peasants that farmed the land in Europe, and one set of my Grandparents started out in this country as farmers in the middle of  Wisconsin . So working the earth is in my genes, and you would think it would be second nature to me.  Unfortunately I have not had a garden in more than 25 years (probably closer to 30).  But Buddy Boy (who wants to be a farmer) had been bugging me this winter to put in a garden this year.  My sister (who used to live about a mile from us, but now lives about 350 miles (560 km) from us, had Buddy Boy and Sweet Pea assist her in putting in a garden a couple of years ago before she moved.  Buddy Boy loved that, especially when they harvested their crop of corn and beans. So I relented (I actually wanted to do it myself, but was afraid of disappointing Buddy Boy if we didn't succeed in growing anything).  I figured even if our crops failed, it would be good therapy for all of us to put in a garden. The first thing we needed to do was clear an area.  We selected an area at the edge of our property, fenced it in (there are tons of rabbits around here), and began to clear the grass.  The first thing we discovered is that although the area where we live was once supposedly an orchard, the land is pretty much an equal mixture of clay and rock.  It took us the better part of 3 days just to clear about 100 square feet (9.29 square meters).  I may not have gardened much lately, but I knew that this plot of ground was not going to grow much anytime soon (I was even surprised that the grass had grown as well as it did). So after doing some reading online, talking to my sister, and getting a consult from Daisy at  Compost Happens  (hey, with a blog name like \"Compost Happens\" she has to know a lot, right?) I decided to break up the top layer of clay and build up a bed of about 4-5\" (about 12 cm) of topsoil before planting anything.  I also decided to get some stones from Home Depot and lay a walkway down the middle of the garden, to facilitate access for  planting, weeding, and harvesting. Once we mixed the topsoil in and spread it all out, it was time to get something to plant.  I figured we'd have a better chance of getting stuff to grow if it was already a seedling, so off to the gardening center we went.  We picked up some seedlings of two types of tomatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins, watermelon, sweet onions, peas, strawberries, and some type of herb that was supposed to attract butterflies.  We also got some seeds for beans, carrots (I picked some stubby ones that were supposed to do better in clay soil), and broccoli. The beans seemed to sprout up to 4 inches (10 cm) overnight.  The carrots and broccoli have also started to grow, and we even harvested our first \"crop\", which consisted of one small strawberry that I had to divide between the two kids.  We topped the garden off with \"Mr. Sun\", which Buddy Boy insisted we buy when we were at Home Depot.  He's always been a sucker for inanimate objects with faces on them. Although I think a synonym that should be listed for gardening is \"weeding\", it's been fun thus far, as well as therapeutic in helping us all work off some excess energy.  And with the problem with  salmonella in tomatoes , we might even have a cash crop on our hands! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SF0v8ekg6xI/AAAAAAAAAa8/BY7vAqebOws/s1600-h/IMG_0959.JPG", "http://www.mapquest.com/maps/sparta+wi/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SF0u1i2dGcI/AAAAAAAAAas/NC7HUouZ7Vc/s1600-h/IMG_0953.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SF0uhDIVlWI/AAAAAAAAAak/bey9yrTaT64/s1600-h/IMG_0954.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SF0vhVQWVqI/AAAAAAAAAa0/6KhLGviHo1Y/s1600-h/IMG_0970.JPG", "http://compostermom.blogspot.com/", "http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/food-poisoning/news/20080610/salmonella-tomato-warning-expanded", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SF0JiCc2MQI/AAAAAAAAAac/sNpLrXH5XXs/s1600-h/IMG_1107.JPG"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/06/mud-therapy.html", "title": "\nMud Therapy\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, June 7, 2008", "body": "\n Buddy Boy's \"Memory Extractor\" I haven't been posting a whole lot lately, especially about personal stuff.  Things got  really hard  for awhile, and it became a combination of not being able/wanting to lay out my personal problems to the whole world (I am basically the silent, keep it in, work it out yourself kind of guy) as well as using all of my spare energy to do my best to keep our family from disintegrating.  School's been out for two whole weeks here.  And we're finally getting back to some semblance of normalcy. The school year started out really well for Buddy Boy.  The majority of his time was spent included in a regular classroom.  Buddy Boy had the best darn teacher in the whole school for his regular class, Mrs. J.  His special ed class teacher (Miss E.) worked well with Mrs. J., and pushed for him to be included more this year.  Buddy Boy (for the most part) rose to the challenge.  Miss E. helped support him for the small amount of time when he was scheduled to be pulled out (for OT and speech), as well as for the few unscheduled times when he had problems in the regular class.  Mrs. J. is famous amongst the school's special ed families for her ability to bring out the best in all of the kids in her class.  I'm really glad that Buddy Boy had her this year, and sad that he won't have her again next year. Things went so well for the first several months that I hardly wrote anything about it.  I was afraid that I would jinx the good fortune we were enjoying.  This was it.  This was the year that Buddy Boy would turn the corner on his behavior issues and be seen by his teachers and classmates as a full, valuable member of the class.   The last 7-8 weeks of school things got progressively worse (mostly at school, but also at home).  I'm not really sure why.  Buddy Boy became upset at the drop of a hat.  He refused to do things that didn't bother him before.  He lashed out and bit a teacher (which required stitches), and hit another.  Liz was literally camped out in the school parking lot, forever on call for when things happened.  Some days she was called three times.  Several days ended early, with Buddy Boy being taken home.   His teachers looked for causes, we looked for causes.  Though Buddy Boy is now quite verbal, he could offer no insight into what was causing him distress.  Liz became increasingly distraught, and lashed out at a most convenient target, me.  We both felt certain that although this school has been very accepting and supporting of Buddy Boy, that the days were numbered until he was kicked out. School ended, and we never got \"the letter\".  You know, the official one that says that your kid has been expelled.  I am still perplexed, but thankful.  This leaves us with more options for next year. Slowly, ever so slowly, we have gotten back to some sort of equilibrium.  It's a big relief that we no longer have the school's sword hanging over our heads (for now).  Liz has relaxed, and even gotten some more sleep.  We are talking again (instead of snapping and snarling, or even worse, saying nothing).  I feel like we're on the same side again. This week I had time off, which we used to go to Chicago.  One of my uncles is dying, and we wanted to see him before he did.  He has worsening congestive heart failure which has reached the limits of medical management, and it is only a matter of time.  How much is hard to say.  This aunt and uncle have always been great to our kids.  Even though they don't have a lot of money (due to having had a special needs daughter themselves, as well as lots of medical bills), they have always sent cards with a note and $2 bills to the kids on all major holidays (Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving) as well as their birthdays.  The kids love those cards. Since we were going up there, we took some time to take the kids to a couple of museums.  Chicago has great museums, though they can be a bit expensive when you're going to multiple ones.  We went to the  Shedd Aquarium  and the  Field Museum . If you plan your trip carefully, you can take advantage of several  free days  at the Field Museum.  Unfortunately my time off didn't correlate with any of those days.   The Shedd Aquarium expanded greatly several years ago, and the kids (and us) loved it.  Besides exploring several halls of fish and amphibians and watching a diver feed the fish in a huge glass tank, we saw a movie and a dolphin show.  The movie was billed as a \"4D\" movie, as in addition to donning 3D glasses, there were air and water jets that shot out at us at various times, as well as vibrating seats.  It was fairly intense from a sensory standpoint, but Buddy Boy hung in there.  The dolphins were cool, especially as we got to go up after the show and get much closer to them. The Field Museum of Natural History is like Indiana Jones' storehouse of everything he ever found on all of his expeditions.  Sweet Pea was a little apprehensive about seeing mummies, but did a good job.  She really liked the t-rex skeleton they had there, as well as some of the stuffed exotic animals.  Sweet Pea also wasn't totally into an exhibit where they simulated you being the size of a small bug underground, but of course Buddy Boy thought it was totally cool.  Liz and I enjoyed a special exhibit they had on George Washington Carver, but the kids seemed they could not care less. We had ice cream and a ferris wheel ride down at  Navy Pier , and headed back to the hotel for another night of swimming. Having spent three days in Chicago, it was time to move on.  On our way back home we took a little detour and went to Moline, Illinois.  Why would we want to go to a relatively small sleepy river town for?  Well, to visit the  John Deere world headquarters  and  pavilion , of course.  As astute readers of this little blog may recall, Buddy Boy has a thing for farming equipment, especially stuff made by  John Deere . While I'd love to take the Ferrari  factory tour  someday, I rather doubt that they'd let my 6 and 8 year old kids crawl all over them, sit in the driver's seat, push pedals and hit the switches.  Yet this is just what Deere lets anyone do with their $300,000 combines, as well as their less expensive equipment.  There are several pieces of farming equipment as well as construction equipment located both at their world headquarters, as well as their pavilion in town.  They also have some antique tractors (which they understandably don't let you crawl all over). All in all, it's great to be getting back to normal.  I don't know what the fall will bring (in terms of school), but for now it's great to kick back a little, relax, and get back into the groove.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SErhG52E25I/AAAAAAAAAY8/qZBl0zZH4Lc/s1600-h/memory+extractor.JPG", "http://www.sheddaquarium.org/", "http://www.fieldmuseum.org/", "http://www.fieldmuseum.org/plan_visit/free_days.htm", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SErjK5VyKjI/AAAAAAAAAZE/2cwWbbeLnrA/s1600-h/IMG_1011.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SErkDnH_QvI/AAAAAAAAAZM/lFQL9rdGSE0/s1600-h/IMG_1028.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SErkwPpJ8AI/AAAAAAAAAZU/caRfwaMVVaE/s1600-h/IMG_1041.JPG", "http://www.navypier.com/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SEroJmYMi7I/AAAAAAAAAZc/9uDns8aov1Y/s1600-h/IMG_1066.JPG", "http://www.deere.com/en_US/attractions/worldhq/index.html", "http://www.deere.com/en_US/attractions/pavilion/index.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SErrsTJxXdI/AAAAAAAAAZ8/K0gtaU-xQyI/s1600-h/IMG_1098.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SErreHJGDDI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/1J4vpCbNAlM/s1600-h/IMG_1103.JPG", "http://www.travel-italy.com/info/emiliaromagna/articles/ferrari_factory_tour.php"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/06/respite-dolphins-mummies-and-tractors.html", "title": "\nRespite, Dolphins, Mummies, and Tractors\n"},

It would seem that Florida may soon have to change their motto from \"The Sunshine State\" to the \"We Hate Kids\" state. Christschool  the other day had a great post about the Alex Barton/Portillo case that brought up issues such as the increasing use of police to handle routine school discipline problems, possible inappropriate training of such personnel, and teachers' complicity in ostracizing those who are \"different\" in their classrooms.  This last point was also blogged by  Joeymom . As  Shawn  pointed out recently, there is a whole system that's at fault here, and not just the teacher (which does  not  absolve the teacher in any way for her part in this). One does not have to  look  far to see other instances where very young children's actions in Florida schools are criminalized, rather than being addressed with behavioral intervention plans.  Indeed, some see a  \"school to prison pipeline\"  that has developed in the Florida education system. Given the undisputed facts of the Barton case and the general climate of making criminals out of young students with undesirable behaviors in Florida, I have to agree with Christschool in saying \"I believe Alex, too\". I'm on the road right now, and visited with my brother and sister-in-law tonight.  My SIL works as a \"para\" in a 2nd grade classroom.  I mentioned the facts of the Barton case to her (she had not heard about the case) using a very neutral voice.  She was appalled, as are many good teachers who have read about this case. Yes, I realize that most teachers are great, and really work for the good of  all  of their students.   I also realize that most teachers work under conditions that are less than ideal, without proper supports in place.  And that puts a great deal of stress on teachers. I'm waiting for the investigation by the Port St. Lucie school district, but absent some finding (backed up by evidence) that great portions of Barton's account were made up, I believe Alex. It's time for Florida to get on the stick, and to stick up for all of its students, not just the ones that are compliant.  This means not only rightfully having sanctions on the teacher involved in this case (Ms. Portillo), but also examining the whole education process in Florida and the whole problem with criminalizing school behaviors that have no place in the criminal justice system.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SEAwD-cqRmI/AAAAAAAAAYE/MpXNmg7p6OU/s1600-h/Florida+map.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrohicks/316349933/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SEIcYOcqRrI/AAAAAAAAAYs/yq1_w27c1FI/s1600-h/space+shuttle.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/http2007/2376455928/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SEA0xucqRoI/AAAAAAAAAYU/vVOLjhqZXlg/s1600-h/florida+oranges.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/view/459892777/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SEA4POcqRpI/AAAAAAAAAYc/Z4biQoQCC-c/s1600-h/south+beach.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/heather0714/215044032/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SEIe4-cqRsI/AAAAAAAAAY0/mn28p58y2rs/s1600-h/mickey+mouse.jpg", "http://autisticnation.typepad.com/thinking_in_metaphors/2008/05/portillo-teache.html", "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2008/05/mama-bears-cubs-and-fate-of-invaders.html", "http://www.alongthespectrum.com/2008/05/and-a-new-goat/", "http://www.wftv.com/news/11455199/detail.html", "http://newstandardnews.net/content/index.cfm/items/3417"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/06/great-place-to-visit-but.html", "title": "\nA Great Place to Visit, But...\n"},

Yesterday's  Boston Globe  reported that the JRC is being investigated, and that state investigators went in to the center last week and seized boxes of documents. I started writing about the JRC about  15 months ago , but they've been up to no good for a lot longer than that.  The JRC is famous for using electric shocks in autistic individuals as a form of \"aversive therapy\".   Inmates  \"Students\" at the center wear backpacks with batteries and shocking devices which  torturers  \"patient care technicians\" can activate at any time by pushing a button.  They shock children for such things as being \"defiant\", or for matters as trivial as \"nagging a teacher\". The state of Massachusetts has considered laws in the past to  ban spanking  of children, but still allows the JRC to continue its daily torture of children. According to the Globe article: State Police seized documents late last week from the offices of the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton that are related to a prank phone call last summer that led two students to wrongfully receive dozens of punishing electrical shocks, according to two people with direct knowledge of the investigation. I guess all of the shocking things that go on at the JRC on a daily basis, like starvation and shocking \"students\" is just fine, but give some of those same \"students\" some extra shocks and NOW they're sitting up and taking notice. The article goes on to say: The collection of evidence has to do with a yearlong grand jury investigation led by the office of Attorney General Martha Coakley, said Kenneth Mollins, a New York lawyer who has filed several lawsuits against the school and who said he spoke to a representative of Coakley's office about the Rotenberg investigation. Mollins said he was told the grand jury is also examining possible financial improprieties by the school. I just hope that this investigation sheds enough light on this stinkhole of a place that the public finally sees it for what it is.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SC4Yp9qv-xI/AAAAAAAAAXs/u7M5GveROU8/s1600-h/tase.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/densaer/1627339244/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/deed.en", "http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/05/15/rotenberg_records_reportedly_are_seized/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/05/justice-delayed.html", "title": "\nJustice Delayed\n"},

And  many others  have since weighed in (scroll down the linked blog for a list of other posts).   I would imagine the vast majority of those who read this blog have already heard about  this , where a Kindergarten teacher thought it thoroughly appropriate to have a 5 year old student stand in front of the class while his classmates were instructed to tell him what they didn't like about him.  The teacher then thought it would be a good idea to have his classmates vote on whether he should be allowed to stay in the class or not. They voted him out, by a vote of 14-2, in a move reminiscent of the American TV show, Survivor. The vast majority of blogging on this that I have seen quite rightly call for the \"teacher\", Wendy Portillo, to be fired immediately. Bev has kindly  posted  some contact info for key people that we can register our (polite) displeasure with. I especially enjoyed Shawn's post at  Along The Spectrum  as he detailed how although Portillo's actions were especially egregious, that there was blame enough to go around to the whole system that allowed this to happen. It has  been recognized  that teachers are sometimes bullies.  Some  teachers bully  because they are sadistic, and some because they were once bullied themselves. Bullying isn't only something that happens in schools.  Increasingly aggressive managers in the workplace sometimes bully their employees, in a style of management referred to as  \"Hamburger Management\" .  In this form of management, competition is stressed amongst workers, with workers constantly encouraged to be better than their co-workers, and be \"winners\". While bullying in the workplace is also wrong, at least the ones being bullied are presumably adults and have the possibility of leaving to find work elsewhere.  Often when pupils in schools report bullying, they are not believed, the bullying continues and often gets worse, and they can suffer long term  mental health consequences .   Once again, I encourage everyone to go to  Bev's blog  for a list of the people you can (politely) contact to let them know that such situations are unacceptable.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SDuJJOcqRkI/AAAAAAAAAX0/02VAxOnK5IA/s1600-h/Alex_B.jpg", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=538", "http://lastcrazyhorn.wordpress.com/2008/05/25/the-golden-rule/", "http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2008/may/23/st-lucie-teacher-has-class-vote-whether-5-year-old/", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/05/not-special-support-alex-barton.html", "http://www.alongthespectrum.com/2008/05/and-a-new-goat/", "http://ednews.org/articles/20389/1/The-Teacher-As-Bully/Page1.html", "http://www.webmd.com/parenting/features/teachers-who-bully", "http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/why-we-should-put-an-end-to-hamburger-management.html", "https://www.toleducation.com/treatments.php?id=2143", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/05/not-special-support-alex-barton.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/05/education-survivor-and-hamburgers.html", "title": "\nEducation, Survivor, and Hamburgers\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, April 30, 2008", "body": "\n When I was younger, I used to wonder how people who lived in Germany let the Holocaust occur.  Over the years, I have come to believe that it was a series of small steps which seemed somewhat reasonable at the time, combined with a sense of \"that doesn't apply to me\" when many things came up, and finally, a tendency to believe those in authority. Today I think I saw up close and personal how things like the Holocaust get started. Peter Singer gave a talk today on a local campus.  His topic was \"Medical Decisions in Life and Death\".  After watching him today, I don't think that the devil wears Prada.  Instead, he wears a rumpled shirt, smiles, is generally pleasant, and advocates for things like puppy dogs and poor people, right before he tries to convince the audience that some people are more valuable than others, and killing babies is OK if their parents decide it's the right thing to do. OK, maybe Singer isn't the devil. But it was somewhat chilling to see students sitting in the audience quietly listening while Singer glibly tried to show that the definition of death is shifting and arbitrary, and that what we should be using to determine whether someone's life is worth living is Singer's somewhat nebulous definition of \"personhood\" which depends not on brain activity but on the ability of the person to be self reflective.  Since he doesn't believe that humans are self aware before they are several months old, they are not persons, and therefore it's OK to kill them, especially if they are disabled.  Singer started by questioning the definition of death, then used selected quotes from (and pictures of) George Bush to (not so subtly) suggest that those who oppose Singer's definition of death and personhood are right wing religious wackos.  Singer then quickly reviewed several cases where people with persistent vegetative states had their feeding tubes removed, and suggested that there was no difference between removing the feeding tubes and letting them die, and actively killing them.  He finished by talking about assisted suicide, and how Oregon's law is leading the way forward. There was time for questions at the end, and after waiting a respectful 4 seconds (so it wouldn't appear that I was gunning for him) I went up to the microphone to ask him a question.  I was hopping mad, and I could hear my voice shaking just a bit.  I asked him how he could place so much importance on preventing what he terms speciesism (discriminating against other animals merely because they are members of different species) while he so freely engaged in disablism by advocating that parents should be able to decide to kill their children up to several months old just because they (the parents) decided selfishly that their own lives would be better, and that the child's life was not worth living.  After all, when disabled adults are surveyed, the majority of them report being happy.  Singer was not fazed at all, and thanked me politely for the question.  He then proceeded to respond with a bland recounting of why babies weren't persons (because of the lack of self response) and how we should respect the parents' wishes.  He then moved on to the next question. I looked around the room at the audience, which was composed mostly of students.  Some seemed to get the point I was making, but most just sat there. And I think that's what happened in Germany, too, when people heard that the Germans were killing the disabled, and later the Jews. For a much better account of how Peter Singer is up close and personal, read Harriet McBryde Johnson's account of her time with Singer  here .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SBjNAhQy2xI/AAAAAAAAAXc/b7OZ3p9kI5g/s1600-h/Peter+Singer-small.jpg", "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401EFDC113BF935A25751C0A9659C8B63"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/04/eugenics-with-smile.html", "title": "\nEugenics With a Smile\n"},

Evidently the whole purpose of them is to harass people who are speaking out by costing them great deals of money to defend themselves. I'm sure that most everyone has heard about the  ridiculous subpoena  that Kathleen Seidel has been served with.  While it appears that she has not been sued, this subpoena is pretty much an all encompassing fishing expedition meant to pursue one purpose, and one alone-silencing Kathleen Seidel.  No one could reasonably believe that there was some grand conspiracy that involved paying off Kathleen to write her blog on neurodiversity.com.  I do not know Kathleen personally, but there is absolutely no indication that she is being put up to write the things she does.  How do I know this?  Because there is no way anyone could ever write so elegantly, so powerfully, and so honestly if they were being paid. Paid product pushers and plants on blogs make themselves known over time.  They can't help themselves.  They post obviously false things that support certain products or positions, in contradiction to all the evidence that there is to be found. Kathleen is the polar opposite of someone who is paid to write from a certain perspective.  When I found out that there was a name for why my son was having so much difficulty with peers and at home, and that that name was autism, I went searching for information on the web.  I first found a local listserve where parents had an ongoing pity party, and most were in search of a holy grail cure.  I continued to search, and rapidly came across three different sites on the web that greatly influenced me.  These were Kristina Chew's AutismVox, The Autism Hub, and Neurodiversity.com.  I loved these sites for different reasons.  Kristina for her personal touch, The Hub for its diversity of opinions, and neurodiversity.com for its obviously well researched list of resources and readings on autism.  I spent days delving through the articles and resources linked from the site.  I felt like I had discovered a cave full of jewels, and I marveled how each one of them sparkled as it was held up to the light.  Such sites are not put together by those who are paid to push a certain viewpoint (If she were being paid, there would be much less content, and a lot more \"splash\" to the site).  The beauty of neurodiversity.com is in the layers upon layers of painstaking research that went into putting it all together. Kathleen's blog has always been top notch.  She doesn't push vague conspiracy theories with no facts behind them.  Instead she publishes extremely well researched, well annotated (a rarity on the web), and well written treatises on subjects related to autism.  A victim of her own success, the existence of this precedent setting subpoena speaks to how well Kathleen's voice is being heard.  Evidently she must be silenced. Many bloggers have stepped up to symbolically link arms with Kathleen.  In whatever small way I can, I am proud to join them.  Kathleen's voice is one that we cannot allow to be silenced. Many (including probably myself) would have been intimidated by such harassment.  To her credit, Kathleen didn't even flinch, and has fired back a motion to quash the subpoena.  You go, girl.  They've SLAPPED the wrong woman.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/R_btJuefuRI/AAAAAAAAAXE/bH71j1h8Brc/s1600-h/no+justice.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/azrainman/1435397649/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/150/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/04/kathleen-slapped-blogs-slap-back.html", "title": "\nKathleen Slapped-Blogs Slap Back\n"},

Do they contribute to autism, or is there a greater risk going without? Actress and mother of an autistic child, Jenny McCarthy, debates the issue with medical professionals.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 25, 2008", "body": "\n photo credit- iboy daniel creative commons license Kristina Chew got me thinking today with her post on  \"Race, Diagnosis, and Identity\" .  In it, she talks about her son Charlie's biracial (Asian/Caucasian) heritage, as well as his other difference, his autism.  Kristina also references an article by Peggy Orenstein in the New York Times Magazine called  \"Mixed Messenger\" , which discusses Barack Obama's biracial status as a candidate, and being biracial in America today. When Liz and I were contemplating adoption, we thought long and hard about whether to adopt trans racially or not, which race children we would accept, and what sorts of disabilities we would accept (our children, Buddy Boy and Sweet Pea are biracial African-American/Caucasian).  It all sounds so clinical, cold, and calculating, but that's what the adoption process asks of you.  You are forced to fill out forms stating what types of children (sex, age, race, disabilities) from what types of parents (drug abusing, smokers, psychiatric issues) you are willing to accept for placement. I knew that kids who had been adopted often had some issues to work thru regarding having been adopted, and I also knew that kids who had been adopted trans racially sometimes were OK with it, and sometimes felt very much like outsiders amongst their own race when they grew up (and resenting their parents who raised them).  I always figured that issues of race would rank high within our family as our kids grew up.   Although our kids are both black and white, I realize that in many places and situations in American the \"one drop\" rule applies (as long as you have one drop of black blood in you, you are considered black).  I knew that even though Liz and I would try to do things to make our kids feel comfortable with their racial identities, that we would most likely not be able to do this fully, and perhaps not even well.  And I didn't want to cheat our kids in this very important aspect of their lives.  On the other hand, I knew that there are more African-American and biracial African-American children waiting for adoptive parents then there are minority parents waiting to adopt.  Thus the choice wasn't necessarily between our kids going to an African-American or biracial couple rather than us, but rather perhaps having to wait much longer to be adopted (or not being placed at all) or being placed with us. I also worried about how African Americans would accept us as a family.  I knew that part of having them grow up being comfortable in their skin would involve us seeking out relationships with African Americans, and I didn't want our kids to see us getting the cold shoulder from black people.  This, it turns out, was a totally unfounded fear.  Once we adopted our kids an amazing thing happened.  I have never felt anything other than acceptance (and even love) from African Americans I know.  So I guess the bottom line was I expected that issues of race would be foremost with us as a family, followed by issues with adoption.  Little did I realize when I started this journey as a dad that autism would trump both of those (at least for Buddy Boy).  For the last 5 years autism has made my previous concerns regarding race and adoption fall completely to the wayside.  I still worry how issues of race will affect my children in the future (as well as my ability to prepare them for the discrimination that they will feel once they leave the protective cocoon of being accompanied by their lily white parents).  I also worry specifically how issues of autism and race will interact in the future with Buddy Boy.  One of the biggest fears I have involves Buddy Boy having a meltdown as a teenager, and being perceived as an \"angry young black man\" by a police officer, and being arrested (or worse) because of the interaction of his disability with his race.  Orenstein in her article mentions A few weeks ago, while stuck at the Chicago airport with my 4-year-old daughter, I struck up a conversation with a woman sitting in the gate area. After a time, she looked at my girl \u2014 who resembles my Japanese-American husband \u2014 commented on her height and asked, \u201cDo you know if her birth parents were tall?\u201d While I don't think anyone should have to suffer other's assumptions about their children, given the choice of someone assuming Buddy Boy was adopted internationally vs. someone assuming he was a gang banger, I'd take the first assumption in a heartbeat. But for the last several years learning to deal with all the myriad aspects of Buddy Boy's autism (and more importantly, fighting against a system that wanted to label him as behaviorally disturbed for education purposes rather than autistic) has consumed most of our energy on a day to day basis. I know that with Sweet Pea we'll still have the issues of race and adoption to deal with.  At 5, she's already hit us with the \"I wish my skin was white like yours\" plea.  While I know intellectually that statements like this are to be expected in trans racial adoptions, it sure made me feel inadequate as a parent at the time.  Had living in a racially mixed neighborhood, playing with the black kids across the street, having a black babysitter, reading to them about black accomplishments, going to museums, had none of this had any effect?  Had we neglected Sweet Pea's development of racial identity because of our time spent trying to get Buddy Boy into (and keeping him from getting kicked out of) a proper educational setting? I guess in the end there are different trump cards at different times. I also know that part of being a parent is to feel constantly inadequate and not up to the task.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/R-gyMeefuOI/AAAAAAAAAWs/09tdzYaefl8/s1600-h/checkerboard.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/iboy_daniel/89538973/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://www.autismvox.com/race-diagnosis-and-identity/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/magazine/23wwln-lede-t.html?ref=magazine"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/03/trump-card.html", "title": "\nTrump Card\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 18, 2008", "body": "\n The film,  \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\"  is a complex yet wonderful western where sometimes crime does pay, and good goes unrewarded.  Life has certainly been complex around our house for the last month, but unfortunately it's been far from wonderful.  And the good has been far outweighed by the bad and the ugly lately. Buddy Boy started out this year having the best year he's had so far.  He loved school, thrived with being included, identified with his classmates, and seemed to really blossom.  Sure there were some minor rough spots, but overall it was shaping up to be a stellar year. Oh how quickly things can change.  If things don't turn around very quickly, he'll be expelled from his school within a week or so, and I won't really blame them. But let's get back to the good.  Buddy Boy made his  First Communion  the Sunday after Easter.  He was having some anxiety and a few outbursts in school running up to that day, but we figured it was related to the upcoming ceremony.  Other than a short crying jag in the procession coming into the church, he did a great job.  I was really proud of him. About a week and a half after that, he bit his teacher.  He hasn't lashed out like that in over a year.  His teachers this year have been great.  They believe in him, see the positive, and support him as well as just about anyone.  But Buddy Boy got upset about something, and just lost it.  The teacher had to go to the Emergency Room.  Two years ago he would have been immediately suspended.  Liz took him home when he couldn't be consoled at the school, but not only wasn't he suspended, we never received any official action taken at all by the school. The subsequent 3 weeks or so have been escalating hell.  Promising him grand rewards has no effect, and neither does confiscating his beloved stuffed dinosaurs.  Buddy Boy has gotten violent with Liz at home, and she is covered with bruises.  The police have been called 3 or 4 times by Liz when Buddy Boy has bolted from the house and she couldn't find him.  Once he was found by the police running thru the underbrush in a park about a half mile from our house.  His face was all scratched up from that. We've had an emergency appointment with his psychiatrist, and took him off one of his meds (Prozac-which had in the past seemed to help with anxiety), which he felt may have been causing an idiosyncratic reaction.  Two days later he erupted in class when he found out that after the chicks hatch from the eggs they're incubating in class, the chicks have to go back to the farm.  He was yelling, swearing at the teachers, spitting at them, telling the teachers he was going to kill them, and for a grand finale dropped his drawers and peed all over the classroom.  Liz kept him home the next day, which was yesterday. Liz, meanwhile, is at the end of her rope.  She's stressed to the max, and cries inconsolably at night.  When she gets stressed she pushes people away, so it's been hard for me to try to get her back from the edge.  She doesn't feel like she can home school Buddy Boy.  She says that it will suck every last bit of energy out of her, and that she will not survive.  I try to point out how perhaps whatever is bothering him will settle down if he gets out of school, but she is not in any kind of receptive mood right now. Buddy Boy, for his part, is not willing or able to talk about what's bugging him.  He's still perfectly verbal overall, and just says that he gets angry, and that it's all our fault.  But he's adamant that he wants to stay in his school.  I really don't think he's trying to get kicked out. I have been largely protected, as I get to go to work.  I've cut back on all non-urgent things so I can be home as much as possible, and have tried to manage things on the weekends, but it's not enough for Liz to rebound.  She feels lost, and out of options.  I have no idea where Buddy Boy will go to school if he gets kicked out of his present placement.  And if he does, we'll also have to find another school for Sweet Pea.  Sweet Pea has been allowed to attend the same school as Buddy Boy, which is not our home school.  The school is overcrowded, and they won't let her stay if Buddy Boy leaves.  We won't put her back in her home school, where the  Wicked Witch of the West  is the prinicipal (she's the one we spent thousands of dollars and over a year fighting with).   I keep it together because we are in the middle of a crisis, but I feel lost, alone, and frustrated as all get out.  We've gone from having our best year yet, to being back at square one.  I'm fairly sure that we've used up all the good will that we're going to get from the school.  Liz volunteers there, which I'm sure has helped.  But I know that they've got to be near their limit of tolerance.  Buddy Boy went back to school today and made it thru the day without any serious incident.  His regular teacher wasn't there.  The substitute basically let them watch movies and play games today.  Liz got to hear the retelling by his classmates of Buddy Boy's meltdown, over and over. That's about it for now.  All prayers will be gladly accepted.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/SAfw8bpRjCI/AAAAAAAAAXM/vphFRFS1b00/s1600-h/good,+bad,+and+ugly.jpg", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Communion"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/04/good-bad-and-ugly.html", "title": "\nThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\n"},

I think that the phenomenon that she describes, whereby people slap certain labels on others, and then make all sorts of assumptions about them, applies to a story I read. According to the online version of the Kansas City Star, The sheriff is recommending charges in the case of a western Kansas woman who sat on her boyfriend\u2019s toilet for so long that her body became stuck to the seat. Ness County Sheriff Bryan Whipple said Thursday he asked the county attorney to file charges against Kory McFarren for mistreatment of a dependent adult. The county attorney will decide whether any charges are brought. ... ... McFarren, 36, told the sheriff at that time that Babcock had not left the bathroom in two years, although McFarren now contends he\u2019s unsure how long she was in there. Whipple said Thursday that judging by the woman\u2019s condition \u2014 she had open sores on which the toilet seat would stick \u2014 it appeared she likely sat on the toilet continually for at least a month. Now I don't know all of the particulars surrounding the story, and I'm certainly in favor of punishing those who abuse the disabled.  But some things in this story don't add up to the typical \"caretaker abuses person in their care\" scenario. First of all, the person being charged is described as the woman's boyfriend, not her caretaker. McFarren said she moved around in the bathroom during that time, bathed and changed into clothes he brought her. He brought food and water to her. They had conversations and an otherwise normal relationship \u2014 except it all happened in the bathroom. But the sheriff disputed that account: \u201cShe hadn\u2019t bathed for quite some time, I am safe in saying. She obviously was not keeping herself up.\u201d McFarren said he finally called police Feb. 27 after he became worried because Babcock was acting groggy, as if she didn\u2019t know what was going on around her. ... ...McFarren, who works at an antique store, said he has been taking care of Babcock for the 16 years they have lived together. So, they live together for 16 years.  Since there's no mention in the story, I'm assuming that this is the first time that the authorities are being called to intervene in this couple's life. Certainly the girlfriend has problems that need attention.  But it sounds like the boyfriend and her had some semblance of a healthy relationship, though extremely odd by conventional standards.  And it sounds like when the boyfriend perceived there was really trouble, he called for help. To make matters worse, it sounds like the sheriff doesn't consider the boyfriend to possess full capacity \u201cThe unfortunate thing is this truly is a case of two people, in my opinion, with diminished mental capacity,\u201d Whipple said.   So why did the sheriff want to press charges? He (McFarren) insisted that he tried to coax her out of the bathroom every day. \u201cAnd her reply would be, \u2018Maybe tomorrow,\u2019\u2002\u201d Whipple said. OK, so they live together for 16 years without having any obvious problems.  Both parties have some issues, and boyfriend exercises some poor judgement in when to seek assistance for his girlfriend (though there is no contention that she wanted any outside help).  Since McFarren (the boyfriend) holds down a job, he is assumed to be able to fully make all decisions that not only affect him, but also another adult. And the sheriff comes in and sees something which he considers too weird, and wants to press charges. Doesn't the county have any psychiatric social workers? Addendum-I missed the fact that Casdok had already blogged about this.  Please see  here  for her take on this story.

{"date": "Friday, March 14, 2008", "body": "\n Sometimes things just happen. I'm sure that the New York Democratic Party never envisioned Governor Eliot Spitzer resigning, which means David Paterson (the current Lieutenant Governor)  takes over as the Governor of New York State  for the next three years. There are probably scores of politicians in New York who now regret not pursuing the post of Lt. Governor.  And there are probably a lot of New Yorkers that will be surprised to learn that their new Governor is not only Black, but legally blind. The position of Lieutenant Governor in New York has always been a somewhat weak one, and one that is not eagerly sought after.  And no one ever envisioned the youthful and energetic Spitzer would ever need to be replaced.  And when the job is playing second fiddle to one with an ego as large as Spitzer's, not everyone might want the job. When Spitzer wanted to reach out to minorities he tapped David Paterson, who was formerly the minority leader in the state Senate. Paterson had also been widely speculated to be the probable replacement for Hillary Clinton in the U.S. Senate if she became President.  Likely few outside of New York noticed, or cared, when he agreed to run as Lieutenant Governor. From all accounts, it sounds like Paterson is the perfect person for the Governor's job.  He is seen as a consensus builder, and is respected by people from both parties.  From  what I've read, he did a good job in the New York state Senate.  During an interview this week he was asked if he ever visited a prostitute.  Showing a wry sense of humor, he responded  \"Only the lobbyists.\" Paterson also noted in the interview that 71% of blind people in this country are unemployed, as are 90% of deaf people.  I hope he continues to highlight such statistics, while pushing New York to be a leader in working to change them. Sometimes things just happen.  And this time, I'm awfully glad that Paterson is the soon to be Governor of New York.  He sounds like just the kind of person that can demonstrate with quiet competence that discrimination against the disabled is not only wrong, but bad for business and society as a whole.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/R9qbNavvSgI/AAAAAAAAAWc/C2XOkox1IcU/s1600-h/Paaterson.jpg", "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/03/11/2008-03-11_next_in_line_david_paterson_would_become.html", "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2008/03/14/2008-03-14_justice_for_eliot.html?page=1"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/03/serendipity.html", "title": "\nSerendipity\n"},

This week, in the sleepy Mississippi river town of Alton, IL, 6 people  have been charged  in the death of a developmentally disabled woman who was 6 months pregnant.  The 6 people charged range in age from 43 down to 12 years old.  According to the story Police said the autopsy revealed Dixon died on January 31 after being repeatedly shot with a BB gun, being scalded with a hot liquid and being beaten on her head and body. They said Dixon's fetus also died. And lest we think that this horrid incident was a crime of passion, Police said the attacks lasted for four to eight weeks. I agree with others that it's not these things we need to worry about so much, as everyone realizes how unacceptable this behavior is, and that  most  people, when it is explained what the  Judge Rotenberg Center  does, also feel that it is unacceptable.  I also feel that what we really have to worry about are the things that fly under our radar, like  all the things that happen  in institutions daily that we never hear about, and how most of us never think twice about the  \"helping\" paradigm  in disability. But still, when I read a story like this one, I still don't understand how people can do such things to each other.

{"date": "Monday, March 10, 2008", "body": "\n Of our two kids, one is on the autism spectrum.  So I'm not surprised when I come home and see toys lined up as in the above picture, as people often write that such things are common.  In retrospect, I also shouldn't be surprised that the same child that lined those toys up also had a lot of GI issues as a baby, likes to hide under tables at times, and is somewhat hyperactive.  We have also had a lot of problems with toe walking, to the point of having to put leg casts on for several months.  Even though not all of these things are listed in the DSM-IV, many children on the spectrum have these same issues, so it shouldn't be surprising that my child displays these features. Except for the fact that the child I'm referencing above is my younger one, Sweet Pea, who is most definitely not autistic.   Sweet Pea is one of the most social kids in her class, and would never qualify for an autism diagnosis. Recently, in the  Poling case , the Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation decided In sum, DVIC has concluded that the facts of this case meet the statutory criteria for demonstrating that the vaccinations CHILD received on July 19, 2000, significantly aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder, which predisposed her to deficits in cellular energy metabolism, and manifested as a regressive encephalopathy with features of autism spectrum disorder.  Many people say that  this document  says that the government admits that vaccines cause autism.  Rather than focusing on what Hannah Poling primarily has (mitochondrial disease), many have focused on the phrase \"features of autism spectrum disorder\". Having never met Hannah Poling, I'm not sure if she is on the autism spectrum.  It is entirely possible that she is.  If one out of 150 individuals are, then it makes sense that at least one out of every 150 individuals with mitochondrial disease is also autistic, independent of their mito disease (I know, there may be more, but I'm talking independent of their mito disease, not linked to it).  But the court document doesn't say Hannah is autistic, just that she displays \"features of autism spectrum disorder\".  And someone looking at certain aspects of Sweet Pea's behavior and condition might decide that she had \"features of autism spectrum disorder\" too, which I know is totally false.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/R9SMGavvSeI/AAAAAAAAAWM/rOnGY4B6mYU/s1600-h/IMG_0545.JPG", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/03/autism-mito-vaccine-court-and-polings.html", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/the-vaccineautism-court-_b_88558.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/03/features-of-autism-spectrum-disorder.html", "title": "\nFeatures of Autism Spectrum Disorder\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, March 8, 2008", "body": "\nThere are a lot of interviews out there with the Polings, following the announcement that the Vaccine Injury Compensation program had ruled in their favor.  One of them I saw was over at  ABC News . Two things struck me when I viewed the video that's up in the upper right corner on that page.  The first is \"What's their lawyer doing with them?\"  I mean, the decision is already in, and this is a civil case, not a criminal case.  Were they afraid that they would say something incriminating?  Or were they afraid that they would say something that would jeopardize the amount of the pending settlement? So then I looked up the lawyer.  The lawyer is  Cliff Shoemaker , who is no stranger to vaccine litigation.  As it says on his website,  \"Today, Cliff is one of the lawyers focusing his attention on the national disaster that occurred in the 90's when we poisoned a substantial number of our children with mercury, creating an autism epidemic.\" Cliff was also evidently the lead attorney for  CoMed  (Lisa Sykes) in suing the FDA to get mercury out of vaccines. The other thing that struck me about that ABC interview was that the father, Dr. Jon Poling, referred to the head of the CDC,  Dr. Julie Gerberding , as \"Ms. Gerberding\" when there's about 3:30 left in the video.  Now it may have just been a slip of the tongue on his part, but I find it hard to believe that a doctor would not know that the head of the CDC was a physician (who also holds a Master's in Public Health).  And I also find it hard to believe that a doctor would not use a fellow physician's title when referring to her.  Unless of course he was trying to purposely make her seem less knowledgeable and important.  I mean, after seeing over at  Kristina Chew's site  that Jenny McCarthy is calling for the immediate resignation of Julie Gerberding as the head of the CDC, I started to wonder.  If I was a conspiracy theorist, I might think that the Polings were coordinating with the Age of Autism folks to try and get Gerberding removed. Meanwhile, Lenora pointed out in a comment to  my last post  that Dr. Poling gave an interview over at  WebMD  that didn't seem to jive with the press conferences. Indeed, in that interview Poling says both \"I don't think the case should scare people,\" says Poling, 37, who emphasizes that vaccines, like all of medicine, carry risks and benefits. as well as \"Vaccines are one of the most important, if not the most important advance, in medicine in at least the past 100 years. But I don't think that vaccines should enjoy a sacred cow status, where if you attack them you are out of mainline medicine.\" \"Every treatment has a risk and a benefit. To say there are no risks to any treatment is not true.'' \"Sometimes people are injured by a vaccine, but they are safe for the majority of people. I could say that with a clean conscience. But I couldn't say that vaccines are absolutely safe, that they are not linked to brain injury and they are not linked to autism.\" This interview seems to be a \"face saving\" attempt by Dr. Poling with the mainstream medical community.  A way for him to say that he knows that there is no science behind the court decision, but that he didn't need science, just a little doubt.  The WebMD  quotes are clearly different from his media interviews, where he emphasizes that  he feels strongly that there are thousands of other cases just like his.  Statements that will certainly scare people away from vaccination. I find it hard to comprehend why a physician could (rightly) admit that there are risks to every procedure or treatment, and then feel entitled to payment when something happens.  Has he bought into the theory that every bad outcome needs to be compensated?  I hope he isn't too disappointed when patients start sueing him for every bad outcome that happens to them, whether it was his fault or not. My parents used to criticize me hanging out with certain kids because they weren't good kids.  They rightly told me that I would be judged by the company I keep. Well, Dr. Poling, I think you're going to be judged by the company  you  keep, as well as  all  the comments you make.  A little backsliding on a medical site won't make up for the fear mongering and atrocious statements not backed up by science that you make to the media, or the fact that you are hanging out with people who hold views that are not supported by any science at all.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MindMoodNews/story?id=4402930&page=1", "http://www.attorneyaccess.net/Cliff.cfm", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2006/10/comed-sues-fda-to-force-mercury-out-of.html", "http://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/director.htm", "http://www.autismvox.com/jenny-we-hardly-knew-ye-2/", "http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20080306/dad-in-autism-vaccine-case-speaks-out"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/03/in-case-there-was-any-doubt.html", "title": "\nIn Case There Was Any Doubt\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 7, 2008", "body": "\n photo credit- eatmeatnow creative commons license Thanks to  S.L.  for putting up a link to the Poling  news conference  on the CNN website. Kristina Chew has detailed this case (the case that some claim links vaccines to autism, but most see no such \"concession\" by the government)  here  and  here . As I watched the news conference, I became increasingly frustrated, and then angry.  You have this high power couple (he a neurologist, she a nurse turned lawyer) who obviously aren't hurting for money.  Even if they haven't made it big yet, they certainly would have been able to provide for their daughter (as well as their two other kids) without the government settlement.  So why did they feel compelled to go forward with this case?  One thought kept coming back to me.  I could almost here mom say, \"We've been cheated!\" \"We had a nice, NORMAL, daughter.  We were supposed to have a summer house on the  Outer Banks , ski in Colorado every year, and in general be a power couple\".  Now mom didn't really say those things, but that's what I understood her meaning to be. The mother did say \"Hannah needs constant one on one supervision\" and \"My husband's heart broke when he realized his daughter might have autism\".  Meanwhile, the camera pans over to show a cute, well behaved 9 year old interacting with two people over on the side.  And I can't help but feel sorry for this girl, who will grow up with the story that she was \"damaged\" by vaccines, but the parents got the evil government to pay.  How she was \"normal\" before this (despite her genetic mitochondrial disorder-which the parents never mention), but now she is damaged goods.  Supposedly mom (Terry Poling) also has a mitochondrial disorder, but has no outward signs. Maybe mom feels guilty about \"causing\" her daughter's \"autism\", and wants to make sure  that no one in their circle of friends will blame her.  Perhaps she's thinking, \"The government admitted it!  They're the ones that did this to us!  We're just like you, really we are.\" I find this rather sad. The money from the government will assist the Polings in keeping up the lifestyle they feel entitled to.  They can point to the government case to \"prove\" that they are truly a \"normal\" power couple who were done wrong by their own government.  And poor Hannah will always be identified within the family as \"damaged goods\", because that's the only way that mom and dad can keep up the pretense that everything is fine. Meanwhile, they obviously have no concern regarding the effects on public health in this country.  When the next  pertussis   or  measles  outbreak occurs because of them parroting the nonsense that vaccines cause autism (which will certainly further decrease vaccination rates in this country), will they feel the least bit guilty?  Or will mom look to \"help\" those moms who lost their kids to vaccine preventable diseases by becoming the lawyer that encourages those parents to sue the government, too? Here's my unsolicited advice to the Polings: OK, you pulled it off.  You managed to tap into the financial largess of the US government (which means the rest of us are paying for this).  Once you get your check, do us all a favor (especially yourselves) and just stop talking about this.  Because I know that you'll never publicly admit that you were wrong, that Hannah had a genetic disease that  something  was bound to aggravate, and it just happened to be a fever that  may  have been caused by vaccination, but nobody really knows.   And I know that if you get stuck in the \"pity party\" and blaming others that you'll never come to truly accept and love Hannah as she is.  You may think that trying to constantly trying to \"fix\" your daughter is the best thing you can do for her, but she will tell you later how devastated she was that you never accepted her for being her.  Let go of the anger you feel, or it will disintegrate your family.  The rest of us will take the extra 5 years to undo the damage you've done, and educate the American public that vaccines really  don't  cause autism.  Just take the money and go away. ------------------------- Addendum:  Three other posts that give great background on this are  Steve's,    Emily's,  and  S.L.'s .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/R9DM2CIdsgI/AAAAAAAAAWE/nAKGDi3hEI8/s1600-h/Pity+Party.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/eatmeatnow/2113011729/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://stopthinkautism.blogspot.com/2008/03/wheres-her-mito-pin.html", "http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/health/2008/03/06/sot.autism.parents.presser.cnn?iref=videosearch", "http://www.autismvox.com/the-case-of-hannah-poling/", "http://www.autismvox.com/what-the-government-said/#comments", "http://www.outerbanks.org/", "http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/sciencemedicine/story/6FA1FB9E07289962862573D900163744?OpenDocument", "http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/18/earlyshow/health/main3842334.shtml", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/03/autism-mito-vaccine-court-and-polings.html", "http://daisymayfattypants.blogspot.com/2008/03/just-facts.html", "http://stopthinkautism.blogspot.com/2008/03/does-my-autistic-child-have-mito.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/03/its-not-our-fault.html", "title": "\nIt's Not Our Fault!!\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 29, 2008", "body": "\n photo credit- DJ1 creative commons license My apologies for not posting lately.  Things have been busy (work, home, kid's school) and I just haven't had the feeling that I had anything of any importance to say lately.  I don't really have anything that important to say today, for that matter, but felt more like posting. Overall, this has been a good year in school.  So good for Buddy Boy that I haven't really talked about it, for fear of jinxing him.  His second grade teacher is the best teacher in the school (at least that's what parents who have had kids in her class say, and I tend to agree).  Mrs. J loves Buddy Boy, sees the positives, is great at motivating him, and is great at including him.  Did I mention that he is included in the main gen ed classroom for the whole day, with the exception of some pull out time for OT?  He has an aide, and has gone from less than half time in the gen ed classroom last year to full time this year.  Buddy Boy has had a few rough spots, but his teacher took them in stride, never threatened that we \"needed to do something about him\", and kept pushing on, expecting him to succeed.  And he has. Buddy Boy still has problems completing his work in school, but his teacher allows for some modifications, and we complete some of it with him at home.  He's doing fine academically, and really excels in spelling.  He loves his class. Sweet Pea is a bit of a pistol, but has settled in fairly well to Kindergarten.  She firmly believes that the world revolves around her, that she is a true princess, and that she always deserves to be first, best, etc., etc.  She is a social butterfly, and has a lot of friends.  She also has some enemies at school (ironically, most seem to be girls amazingly like her, who also think that they are the best and only ones).  But mostly she's done just fine. I really shouldn't (and can't) complain.  Especially when I read some other blogs, and see that some of my cyber acquaintances (I'd call y'all cyber friends, but you'd probably think I was a bit creepy) like  Niksmom  and  Marla  are going thru right now.  I truly have nothing to complain about. And yet I've been down a bit lately, because Buddy Boy has been struggling a bit more (getting into more arguments with his teacher at school, refusing to do homework, etc.) over the last few weeks.  About 5 weeks ago he trashed our kitchen, including breaking up a wooden chair.  It seemed to be an isolated incident at the time.  I've asked him if he's unhappy in school, but he says he's not.  I think he feels pressure, but he also desperately wants to stay in the gen ed room.  This week has been especially bad at school (compared to how the rest of this year has been). This week Buddy Boy's class has a student teacher (without the regular teacher in the room), and his aide has been out sick (and has not been replaced).  They are covering the solar system in his class, and it is being presented as a \"Space Adventure\".  The solar system is one of Buddy Boy's favorite things.  He can name the planets (in order) tell me which ones are gas planets, was sad when Pluto lost its planetary designation, etc. Whether it's been having the student teacher, not having his aide, or just one of those things, for the first three days this week he had to be removed from science class.  As soon as the teacher started talking about the solar system he started interrupting, saying \"It's not a space adventure!\"  He wouldn't (or couldn't) say what exactly he thought it should be, but something was truly upsetting about the way this was being presented, and he basically decompensated.  When Buddy Boy decompensates, he gets less verbal, starts verbal ticks (grunts, clearing his throat, barking) and then starts getting physical (throwing things and/or tearing at his clothes).  No one got hurt, and the school hasn't threatened to do anything, but it's been kind of disappointing.   Once he was out of the classroom, he stayed out for the rest of the day.  Things were going so good.  We've tried talking to him about it the last few days, but  he can't really say what's been setting him off, and each day has been pretty much the same.  Liz called his teacher yesterday, and politely but firmly said that he absolutely needed to have an aide, as he was clearly having problems.  His teacher agreed. Today he got thru Science class!  Maybe it was getting an aide back, maybe it was a fluke, or maybe he's accommodated to the changed teacher and unorthodox method of presenting the material.  But for whatever reason, he made it thru today, which was good. Meanwhile, down the hall in Kindergarten Sweet Pea was getting herself in a bit of trouble.  Earlier this year the school called us because one of the parents complained that Sweet Pea was weaseling food from her daughter.  Not exactly stealing it, but going up to this other girl and saying things like \"That sure looks good.  I sure would like some of that.  Can I have some of your food?\"  This other girl didn't seem able to just say no, but always felt bad, and would go home and cry about this.  The school also has a strict \"No Food Sharing\" rule, to prevent kids with allergies from getting the wrong food, as well as for general decorum.  We talked about it when we found out, and thought she had stopped it. Well last week we found out that Sweet Pea has been up to her old tricks again (and with the same girl).  I guess she figures if there are no teachers directly around her at lunch time that she can get away with it.  While I worry that my son will get bullied at school, his little sister is practicing her own bullying skills (this year treats from another's lunch, next  year the lunch money?).  So this time we've grounded her three favorite stuffed animals (all cats) and have threatened that if it happens again, her birthday party at the end of next month will be canceled.  I'm hoping that will do it.  But I fear that even if this battle is won, there will be many bigger ones with her in the future. I'm crossing my fingers that Buddy Boy gets thru tomorrow OK, so he can finish the week on an up note, and that Sweet Pea doesn't forfeit the party.  Because she has been planning this party since last year, and I know she's really looking forward to it. Like I said, nothing earth shattering, or really all that interesting.

{"date": "Monday, February 18, 2008", "body": "\nHow do you counter ignorance?  Especially when that ignorance preys on the deepest fears of parents, and reels in parents with compelling anecdotes, pseudo science, and tales of government conspiracies?   Many parents, after getting a diagnosis of autism for their child, panic.  They are confused, worried, and looking for direction.  And rather than offer encouragement and hope for the future, many autism 'support groups', fueled by hope peddling purveyors of miraculous 'cures', tell these parents that their kids are autistic because of vaccines.  That the government, doctors, and 'big pharma', all working together (both here and across the world) have all conspired together to suppress the fact that vaccines cause autism. How do you counter the passionate beliefs of a number of parents that have bought into such nonsense, after spending thousands of dollars on supplements and possibly dangerous treatments, and who now see some 'improvement' in their children as they grow up and naturally mature? With other parents. Parents who have read the increasing number of dull and boring studies that show no linkage between vaccines and autism.  Parents who finally say \"Enough is enough\", and come to see that there's no way the whole world is conspiring to keep them in the dark. Years of dull, boring (but legitimate) scientific inquiry have not been enough to quiet the voices of the conspiracy mongers.  So now the American Academy of Pediatrics (the AAP) is asking for parents to speak up and proclaim the truth.  That even though we don't know all the things that cause autism, there is no linkage between vaccines and autism.  That those who continue to support that argument are endangering public health.  Whether it's measles outbreaks in Great Britain or San Diego, people's lives are being put at risk by the fear  mongering that is causing people to reject vaccination. The following is a letter from the AAP asking for parents to make themselves available for public comment.  Please read the letter and consider offering your services.  It may save a life. Hello, As part of our ongoing response to media stories regarding autism and vaccines, the AAP communications department is compiling a list of parents who support the AAP and are available for interviews. We are looking for two types of parents who could serve as spokespersons: Parents of children with autism spectrum disorders who support immunization and who do not believe there is any link between their child's vaccines and his or her autism. Parents of children who suffered a vaccine-preventable illness. This could be a parent who declined immunization, whose child became ill before a vaccine was available, or whose child was ineligible for immunization. We are asking for your help identifying parents who would be good spokespersons. They do not need to be expert public speakers. They just need to be open with their story and interested in speaking out on the issue. We will contact candidates in advance to conduct pre-interviews, to offer guidance on talking to reporters and to obtain a signed waiver giving us permission to release their name. If a parent were placed on our list, we would offer their name and contact information to select media. We hope to build a list of parents from a wide range of geographical areas. As the Jenny McCarthy and \"Eli Stone\" stories illustrate, this issue is likely to recur in the national and local media. The AAP is committed to doing all we can to counter such erroneous reports with factual information supported by scientific evidence and AAP recommendations. The anti-vaccine groups often have emotional family stories on their side. The ability to offer a reporter an interview with a similarly compelling parent who is sympathetic to the AAP's goals is a powerful tool for our media relations program. Please contact me if you have any questions or to suggest a parent to interview. Thank you, Susan Stevens Martin Director, Division of Media Relations American Academy of Pediatrics Those who wish to make themselves available can contact Susan Stevens Martin directly at  ssmartin@aap.org . It's time to stop wasting time and money chasing rainbows.  It's time for right minded people to stand up and be counted.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/02/facing-ignorance.html", "title": "\nFacing Ignorance\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, February 13, 2008", "body": "\n photo credit- angela7dreams creative commons license Buddy Boy has some OT time at school, where he basically plays games with other kids, and he also goes once a week to a private class where a facilitator does much the same with a group of kids.  Buddy Boy relates reasonably well with adults, but has never done especially well with other kids. I've often pondered what were the reasons that Buddy Boy doesn't make friends, as well as the reasons that he is sometimes confrontational in encounters.  It's not like he doesn't want friends.  He laments at times that he doesn't have friends and isn't invited  for sleepovers.  From observing him at the park, I can say that he doesn't initiate encounters much with other kids, and doesn't respond much if other kids approach him.  When I've tried making suggestions to him at the park, he says he doesn't want to play with the other kids, or that he doesn't want to do what they are doing. I think that the efforts that the OT at school and the social skills class we take him to outside of school are worthwhile, but I also don't think that they are all of the solution.  It's one thing to relate to other kids in highly controlled situations, and it's quite another in spontaneous encounters.  So I actively supplement Buddy Boy's social skills education by taking him to parks during the summer, and fast food establishments with play areas all year long. Paying for a 'Happy Meal' is less expensive than what we pay for each social skills class, and I think it's at least as productive.  I talk to Buddy Boy ahead of time, reminding him of some of the rules (sharing, not being aggressive, taking turns) and then try to hang back somewhat and see what happens.  If I sense a need I'll intervene, but mostly try to let him figure things out on his own.  Buddy Boy, of course, thinks that it's all his idea to go to these places, as he's eating out and getting to go play.  Which is just fine with me. This last weekend we went to one of several fast food establishments that has a play area.  It's one of my favorites because it also has free wi-fi, so I can catch up on postings on the Autism Hub while I keep an eye on the kids. Most of the time went fairly well.  There was a fairly good size group of kids there, and both Buddy Boy and Sweet Pea seemed to be getting along all right, though most of their play was of the 'parallel play' variety.  I don't mind this, as there are always plenty of opportunities when there are several kids around for negotiations between different kids (who gets a turn on the video game next, who's turn is it now on the slide, etc.). I was just getting ready to have the kids get their shoes back on and get ready to leave when I saw a female adult on the far side of the play area talking to Buddy Boy.  I quickly sauntered over to see what was up.  You know the walk-not wanting to run over and make a scene, but knowing that something isn't right and wanting to get over there and fix it. As I approached, I saw a girl of about 4 years old next to the woman crying.  Uh oh.  The woman  informs me that Buddy Boy (who was almost twice the little girl's size) had called the girl a bad name, and had stomped on her foot.  I apologized to the woman, asked if her daughter was all right, and proceeded to tell Buddy Boy that he had just forfeited the 'toy' that came in his Happy Meal.  This of course started him crying, which in one way made the situation worse, but in another helped us out.  The mom started feeling sorry for Buddy Boy, telling me he was trying to protect his sister (Sweet Pea) and that her daughter was all right.  I apologized again, quickly got the kids together, and made a hasty retreat out the door.  I purposely didn't use the \"He's autistic\" excuse because I didn't want to further the falsehood that all autistics are violent, and I also didn't want Buddy Boy to get the idea that being autistic was an excuse for bad behavior. In piecing the incident together with the kids in the car, Sweet Pea indeed had asked Buddy Boy to protect her (why Sweet Pea needed protection from a kid that was a bit smaller than her was unclear).  Buddy Boy hasn't had problems with physical aggression at school this year, but often gets reprimanded at home for aggressive actions with us and Sweet Pea.  I figure that this girl was similar enough to Sweet Pea's size that he naturally fell into his habitual way of dealing with conflict with Sweet Pea. I guess we won't be going back to this establishment for a month or two.  Luckily I have a few others that are in our rotation. Even though moments like these are uncomfortable and a bit rocky, I think that necessary lessons are learned in such environments, and without the give and take of free play the lessons put forth in formal social skills classes never have a chance of being generalized. Oh, and the bad name he had called the girl?  'Stupid white girl'.  The mom had obviously processed this as a racial put down by Buddy Boy.  While I'm sure that the 'stupid' part was a put down by him, I know that for him the 'white girl' part was just a descriptor, as he didn't know her name.  I didn't stop to explain this to the mom, as I was happy to just make a quick exit.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/R7JVF9_gRvI/AAAAAAAAAVs/A_40UBTMIEA/s1600-h/Impalas-2.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/angela7/68245801/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/02/social-skills-school-of-hard-knocks.html", "title": "\nSocial Skills School of Hard Knocks\n"},

{"date": "Friday, February 1, 2008", "body": "\n One of the complaints that I have often seen in regards to how autism is treated by society is that autism is approached from a medical oriented/disease based perspective, and not a social model. In a recent  JAMA   (Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol. 299 No. 3, Jan. 23, 2008) journal there is a commentary written by Lisa Iezzoni, M.D. (Institute for Health Policy, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston) and Vicki Freedman, Ph.D. (Department of Health Systems and Policy, School of Public Health, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark).  The article is entitled  \"Turning the Disability Tide: The Importance of Definitions\" .  Unfortunately the entire article is only available online if you (or the institution you work for) has a subscription to JAMA.  Requests for reprints can be made to the corresponding author, Dr. Iezzoni, at liezzoni@partners.org .  JAMA can also be found at most public libraries. Both Dr.'s Iezzoni and Freedman served on the Institute of Medicine's Committee on Disability in America, so one can presume (both from that affiliation as well as publication in JAMA) that their opinions are valued in the medical community on this subject. The authors start with a brief overview of disability in America: Forty million to 50 million individuals in the United States now live with potentially disabling conditions. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), this number will likely increase substantially in coming decades. Aging baby boomers will fuel much of this growth as this enormous cohort enters age ranges with the greatest disease and disability risks. Although rates of some serious limitations among elderly individuals have declined, sobering reports warn of higher rates of potentially impairing conditions among children and working-age adults. ... ...As have others, we argue that devising strategies to confront disability must first start by defining disability. Definitions implicitly connote goals, which in turn suggest potential solutions and targets for action. When it comes to preventing or deterring disability, this definition matters. The authors then describe a brief history of disability definitions, detailing how by the early 1800's physicians had been designated as impartial arbiters of disability, and how increases in technology that allowed them to obtain objective data only solidified that role.  Moving on, the article describes how: Decades later, social changes upended medicalized notions of disability. Confluent forces, including the independent living movement, self-help initiatives, consumerism, deinstitutionalization, and civil rights campaigns for racial and ethnic minorities and women, catalyzed an incipient disability rights movement. By the 1970s, a new paradigm held that \"problems lie not within the persons with disabilities but in the environment that fails to accommodate persons with disabilities and in the negative attitude of people without disabilities.\" Disability is \"imposed on top of our impairments by the way we are unnecessarily isolated and excluded from full participation in society.\" This new \"social\" model of disability diverged importantly from medical model tenets. \"The social model . . . views the issue mainly as a socially created problem and basically as a matter of the full integration of individuals into society. Disability is not an attribute of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, many of which are created by the social environment.\" The issue is therefore an attitudinal or ideological one requiring social change, which at the political level becomes a question of human rights. Finally, the authors remark about the importance of the  International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)  which was published by the World Health Organization (WHO) initially in 1980, later revised in the 1990's, and unanimously approved by 190 member countries in 2001.  The authors support the fact that the ICF integrates the medical and social models of disability. Explicitly recognizing the role of external forces (physical, social, and attitudinal) in precipitating or mitigating disability represents one of the major contributions of the ICF. Equally noteworthy, the ICF introduced participation in daily and community life as an explicit component of health. This concept shifted the emphasis from strict prevention to maximizing functioning and well-being\u2014perspectives consonant with public health goals in an aging society. By presenting disability as a continuum, the ICF emphasized the universality of disability and stressed its \"relevan[ce] to the lives of all people to different degrees and at different times in their lives.\" My opinion (as I've stated before) is that doctors, for the most part, are not the initiators of the oppression that the medical model places on those with disabilities.  Rather, they reflect the predominant societal thinking at a particular time and place in history.  This commentary, then, is important because it means that  societal perceptions and goals are changing.   While I think it important that physicians lead when possible, I think that for the most part this commentary reflects an emerging trend within society, and not just the views of two isolated individuals.  Getting definitions right will help society to fashion laws and policy that lead towards a more inclusive society.  And that is something I can feel good about while I contemplate what the future holds for my autistic son.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/R6ODHdh5WPI/AAAAAAAAAVc/wBe9Ad_tbI8/s1600-h/jamath_v299_n3.jpg", "http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/vol299/issue3/index.dtl", "http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/299/3/332"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/02/turning-disability-tide.html", "title": "\nTurning the Disability Tide\n"},

Mad Science!  was the theme for Buddy Boy's birthday party with his classmates (was I only dreaming, or did we really have birthday parties when I was a kid that weren't \"themed\"-our parents would host them at the house, we'd play some silly games like pin the tail on the donkey or pitching clothespins into milk bottles, have some cake and call it a day).   As readers of this blog will recall, I was just a  bit  anxious  last week  that we would have enough kids coming to even have a party.  My unspoken fear was that Buddy Boy was being ostracized already as the \"odd kid\", and that no one wanted to attend his party because of that. Liz mounted a phone campaign to \"follow up\" with all of those that hadn't RSVP'd, and we ended up with 12 kids total, out of a possible 20.  Certainly a respectable showing (I would have been satisfied with 6-7, including our own 2, so 12 was great).  The scientist came in and performed most of the usual type stunts that kids like, while providing some education along the way.  Things like demonstrating the amazing water absorbing properties of sodium acrylate (the stuff that's used in disposable diapers), a Tesla generator, how different metals burn with different colors, and (of course) fun with dry ice.  All of the kids made their own 'slime', which they got to take home with them. Instead of gifts, we had each kid bring a book, and then we had a book exchange.  It seemed to go over well.  One very thoughtful young girl, who admitted that she didn't like bugs at all, brought a book all about bugs that she thought that Buddy Boy would like.  He ended up picking a different book, \"Diary of a Fly'. Two hours (three with set up and take down), no major incidents (I don't count the one kid at my end of the table who was eating the cake by putting his face in it-he was being encouraged by some of the other kids), all of the kids seemed to have fun, and Buddy Boy and Sweet Pea both liked it.

{"date": "Wednesday, January 23, 2008", "body": "\n I mentioned in my  last post  that Buddy Boy wanted to go see the  Body World  exhibit at our local science museum.  I've had mixed feelings about this, as this exhibit has been surrounded by some  controversy , and from what I had heard it sounded like it was more sensationalistic than educational.  But a fair number of people that I know had gone to see it and were favorably impressed, so after talking with Liz and with Buddy Boy we decided to go. The exhibit, for those that aren't familiar with it, exhibits dissected human bodies posed in various poses.  Most of these poses are somewhat artistic or athletic in nature.  This type of exhibit has been made possible by a process called plastination that was developed by the founder/owner of Body World, Gunther von Hagens.  There are 4 Body World exhibits, which in the US circulate between various science museums.  These exhibits have been shown in some art museums in Europe, but in the US they are shown as 'educational' exhibits in science museums.  They have made a lot of money for von Hagens, as well as the museums that host the exhibits. Although the hosting museum did not do anything that I considered exploitave, and had some docents explaining some things in the exhibit, on the whole I was a little bit uncomfortable with it.  I suspect my discomfort stemmed from the basic difference in how the bodies were displayed, as compared to my medical dissection classes.  When we dissected bodies in school, it was a special class.  We were admonished to always respect those who had donated their bodies so that we could gain knowledge, the bodies were always treated respectfully, and when we were finished with them at the end of the term we had a short ceremony in the lab to \"thank\" them for their contribution to our learning, after which the bodies were taken away for burial. In contrast, the bodies in Body World are posed, as I stated above.  I suppose in some ways this can be justified to illustrate how certain muscles are used in certain ways, but it struck me somehow as being located somewhere between voyeurism and pornography. That being said, the dissections were all top notch, and there was certainly knowledge to be gained for those who approached it who had not had previous anatomy experience. As we walked thru the exhibit, Buddy Boy clearly felt that this was my domain.  Whenever someone near us would ask a question of someone near them, Buddy Boy would interject \"You should ask my dad, he's a doctor!\"  I just smiled and kept walking. There was one great \"That's my boy!\" moment during our walk thru.  At one point there was a docent talking about structures that he pointed to on a coronal section of a person's abdominal region (kind of a one inch thick human CT scan).  While pointing to the intestines he stated that a particular structure he was pointing to was very important to digestion, and before he could ask anyone to identify it Buddy Boy piped up \"It's the villi!\".  The man looked up at Buddy Boy, smiled, and asked him if he knew why they were important.  That was all the encouragement Buddy Boy needed.   Buddy Boy proceeded to explain that it was in the villi that all the important nutrients were absorbed, which then went into the bloodstream, and were subsequently carried throughout the body where they were needed.  The docent put down the section, smiled, and said \"I think that pretty much covers it\".  The six or seven people standing around him just looked at Buddy Boy in awe.  I must admit that I was impressed that Buddy Boy had identified the villi from a cross section, though I suppose the hint that the structure was important to digestion helped a lot. As the years go by, I wonder more what the future holds for Buddy Boy.  Right now I'm wondering how to combine anatomy and farming into a viable career.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/R5arAdh5WLI/AAAAAAAAAU8/1USehC4lPKg/s1600-h/body+world.jpg", "http://www.bodyworlds.com/en.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Worlds#Controversies"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/01/veni-vidi-villi.html", "title": "\nVeni, Vidi, Villi\n"},

Next weekend we are having a \"kids\" birthday party on Sunday, to which we've invited all of his classmates.  We haven't had a kids party in a few years, so I don't know if it will come off OK or not.  So far, out of a possible 20 kids, we've received 4 'No's', 2 'Yes's', and one verbal yes (from a classmate) without a formal RSVP.  I'm praying for a few more 'Yes' responses.  Doesn't anyone know what RSVP means anymore???? But that's this coming weekend, and we'll deal with that then. This past weekend we had our family celebration, which went well.  In case you don't remember, Buddy Boy has a thing for  farm machines  (especially combines), and has narrowed that of late to all things 'John Deere'.  Now while we live within easy driving distance of farms, we've never lived anywhere remotely rural.  This hasn't stopped Buddy Boy from being fascinated by these machines, and there use in farming. For Christmas Buddy Boy got (yet another) toy farm machine (A tractor with a sprayor type apparatus on the back), as well as a boxed set of 5 John Deere DVD's (we laughed when we found these-who'd of new they made such things) and the shirt he's wearing in the picture.  When asked what kind of theme he wanted for his birthday, farm machines was what he wanted. Evidently John Deere has a very good marketing department.  Because besides the shirt, the toys, and the DVD's, we also found the plastic logo to stick in the cake, as well as John Deere plates and napkins for the cake. Buddy Boy had a good time.  He's been wanting to go to the Science Museum to see the Body World exhibit, and after talking about it between us and with him, we took him.  I think I'll save describing that for a separate post.  Suffice it to say that it went well, and Buddy Boy had a good time. After the museum we returned home for Chinese food, presents, and cake and ice cream.  One of my brothers lives in town, so he joined us.  We all had a good time, and Buddy Boy went to bed with a smile on his face. I'm still anxious regarding what's going to happen next week (will anyone show up?, will he like the party?, will the other kids like the party?) but as I said, that'll have to wait for now.

As most everyone in the world with any connection with autism knows, in May, 2006 Karen McCarron murdered her child Katie by holding a garbage bag over her head until she suffocated and died.  Her lawyer had argued that she was not guilty by reason of insanity, but the evidence said otherwise, as she actively tried to cover up her crime. Karen McCarron was a doctor.  A person who was trained to heal.  Since at least the  late 19th century , the phrase \"primum non nocere\" (First, do no harm) has been a common medical aphorism.  The admonition is to make doctors stop and consider any harmful effects their treatment might have, and make sure that the potential beneficial effects outweigh the bad. The last time I checked, murder was not considered a viable treatment option for anything. The end of the trial brings a conclusion for the rest of the McCarron family who grieve for their lost child, but I am afraid that this is not the end for those who would do harm to those who are different. Katie McCarron was loved by many, and murdered by a woman who betrayed the trust that Katie put in her as her mother, a person who was trained to heal, but chose to murder. There is no joy in the guilty verdict.  It will not bring Katie back.  But perhaps-perhaps it will give some pause to those who would make videos saying that they have considered killing their offspring.  Perhaps it will give some pause to those who concentrate on \"getting rid of the autism\" instead of loving their child. Perhaps it will make all of us think differently when we see people disparaged, disowned, and devalued for their differences.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/01/primum-non-nocere.html", "title": "\nPrimum non nocere\n"},

Huh??? It never ceases to amaze me what utter nonsense people will spew at times, especially if it serves to cover their own butt in some way. HIPAA (for all of those outside the US, and anyone inside that US that has been asleep for the past several years, stands for Health Insurance Portability and Acountability Act.  It is a law passed by congress in 1996 in the US that (amongst other things) is supposed to ensure that your private medical information stays private (except from government agencies, anyone doing research, and anyone your insurance company decides to share the info with-but that's a rant for another day). The practical application of this law is that you have to sign a form at your doctor's office saying that you are aware of your HIPAA rights, you also sign a form for your insurance company waiving those rights (or they won't insure you), and there are extra people employed at all levels of healthcare spending time making sure that people's rights are not violated (proper forms must be filled out, and access to medical records is controlled-while any clerk at the insurance company can see your records, your doctor has to jump thru password protected hoops to prove he qualifies to see them). The people that are affected by HIPAA are health care practitioners (like doctors, nurses, pharmacists, etc.), health care entities (like hospitals and nursing homes), insurance companies, and any business entity that contracts with either of these (like the cleaning service for a doctor's office).  All of those people can get in big trouble if they start selling copies of Britney Spears' hospital records to the National Enquirer.  But nowhere in any of the law is a school listed as being under the purview of this law, and I have heard no references in the media of schools and HIPAA violations. The first question that needs to be answered, is if a school is even a \"covered health care entity\" under HIPAA.  The short answer is probably not, unless the school is billing for the services of its school nurse or transmitting electronic medical records on patients.  If the school is not a covered health care entity, then HIPAA only applies to the school nurse, and not to the school as a whole.  Since the school nurse shouldn't be walking into classrooms and announcing who has what \"disease\" or is taking what meds, there should be no conflict from HIPAA in having student's parents coming in to observe in a classroom. The suggestion that because other special ed students are present in a class, and that other parents might not want you to know their kids are in special ed is also very suspect.  All of the kids in school know who is in special ed.  Unless the school wishes to provide a separate classroom for every special ed student, it will not be a secret who is in special ed.  So allowing parents to observe a class does not violate any confidentiality.  Indeed, there is no expectation of total privacy in a public school.  If there was, then parents could never go to any school function where they might see other students, such as athletic events, assemblies, or school outings. There is a federal law that governs confidentiality of school records.  It's a law that has been around since the 1970's, and is called the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (or FERPA-gotta love those governmental acronyms).  According to  Wrightslaw.com : The purposes of FERPA are twofold: to ensure that parents have access to their children's educational records and to protect the privacy rights of parents and children by limiting access to these records without parental consent. Some schools may fall back on FERPA as the reason that parents are not allowed to observe in class.  But even that doesn't have a leg to stand on. Again,   Wrightslaw.com  (one of my favorite sites for special education law) addresses this question well, when talking about parental involvement and what the No Child Left Behind act has to say.  Schools that receive Title I funds must meet with parents to develop a parental involvement policy and must distribute the policy to parents and the community. Parents of children who attend Title I schools shall have access to school staff, opportunities to participate in the child's class, and to observe classroom activities. (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 6318)    So, to get back to the original point.  From what I know and have read regarding HIPAA and FERPA, neither law should preclude or prevent a parent from observing their child in a classroom, or observing a proposed classroom before a child is placed in it.  Indeed, the NCLB act mandates parental involvement, and spells out a parent's right to observe classroom activities. To deny such rights (IMO) means either that people in the school are supremely ignorant, arrogant, or just trying to hide something.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/R42iXbaU2hI/AAAAAAAAAUY/Gy_wtCgankw/s1600-h/stethoscope.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brendanadkins/474585401/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://wrightslaw.com/", "http://wrightslaw.com/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/01/playing-doctor.html", "title": "\nPlaying Doctor\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, January 8, 2008", "body": "\n photo credit- Conor Lawless Creative Commons license Once again, the purported link between mercury/thimerosal and autism is in the news.  This months  \"Archives in General Psychiatry\"  contains an article which looks at the continuing increase in the reported prevalence of autism in California while the amount of mercury is declining, and there is also an accompanying commentary in the same issue. This article and commentary were discussed by  Kristina Chew .   Mark Blaxill , a leading proponent of the \"autism=mercury poisoning\" line of thought, backpeddles somewhat without totally conceding that the theory is dead.   Brett of 29 Marbles  asks what it would take for either side to change their mind. Although I ultimately look to science to inform my opinions on things such as causality, I am not above referring to common sense, which is not a bad place to start when considering what kind of studies should be done. One of the things that has made me doubt the whole autism=mercury poisoning thing from the start are dentists, and the amalgams they place.  Specifically, where are all the autistic kids who had dentists and dental assistants as parents?  More specifically, where is the large group of autistics that are 35-55 years old that had dentists or dental assistants as parents? Why do I choose that age range?  For a couple of reasons.  Since autism wasn't described until the 1940's or so, I wouldn't expect older autistics.  Also, this period would correspond to a time when dental caries were rampant (pre-fluoridation of water), as well as a time when handling of mercury and amalgam in dental offices was very casual.  Mercury and metal filings (silver and zinc) used to be hand measured into a device, which then shook them together (right at the chairside) until they became a soft \"amalgam\" which was then packed into the cavity in the tooth.  The dentist is typically \"right in your face\" as (s)he packs the amalgam into the tooth. While some people today still blame mercury fillings for the exceedingly small amount of mercury vapor that is released by chewing on amalgam fillings, no one disputes that the greatest period of exposure to mercury is when the amalgam is first being mixed together.  Since the 1970's or so, dental amalgams have come in a pre-proportioned sealed container, which minimizes the amount of mercury in the air in a dental office.  Also, the number of amalgams that are placed today, while still large, pales compared to the past.  Fluoridation started in the U.S. in 1955, and by the 1960's started to catch on.  This resulted in a lot less exposure to mercury per child. But between the time that autism was first described and the decline in amalgam fillings being placed in children there should have been an epidemic of children identified with autism, which declined as fillings per child dropped off.  There should have been an even  bigger  incidence in the children of dental workers (dentists and dental assistants) who were occupationally exposed on a large scale to mercury vapor. Where are they? There are no studies that have shown this, and I am not even aware of any anecdotes of this phenomenon happening.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/R4PUPraU2fI/AAAAAAAAAUI/R5cOqjUfMQs/s1600-h/dentist.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/conchur/1572262745/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en", "http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/", "http://www.autismvox.com/thimerasol-exposure-declines-autism-rates-increase/#comment-299473", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/01/making-sense--1.html", "http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2008/01/what-would-it-take-or-why-debate-will.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/01/where-are-all-autistic-children-of.html", "title": "\nWhere are all the autistic children of dentists?\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, December 20, 2007", "body": "\nLike many in the autism related blogosphere, I rejoiced yesterday when I heard that the NYU \"Ransom Notes\" campaign had been pulled by its director, Dr. Harold Koplewicz.  I had  blogged  about my ethical concerns with this campaign, and felt that the campaign demeaned those who had those conditions, and would only further continued ostracizing and marginalizing by the public at large. It is a huge thing for someone to stop an ad campaign that is just getting underway.  I am sure that there were a lot of people that had a lot invested in designing and implementing that campaign, and it was hard for them just to scrap it.  It is a testament to Ari Ne'eman's astute perception of the exact tone to strike in opposing this campaign, and his organizing prowess that this victory took place. At the same time, I give Dr. Koplewicz credit for his part in this.  Having launched a big campaign, and after reviewing the large outpouring of negative comments, he was willing to not let his ego stop him from doing what was the right thing.  As I stated in my original post, there is much in his past stated comments, as well as publications, to think that he is not the enemy of autistics and others with various conditions.  When someone stops, apologizes, and asks for input, I think they deserve the benefit of the doubt. I think it is a major step that Dr. Koplewicz proposed a \"town hall\" forum that would include viewpoints of all the stakeholders of the campaign. Now that the \"relatively easy\" part of objecting to what was obviously a very negative and hurtful campaign is over, the real work needs to begin.  It is much easier to protest than to come up with positive and catchy slogans and ad campaigns.  I have great hope that there are many very creative individuals within the disability community that will help in designing a campaign that all can be proud of, and that will be effective. On another front, as has been mentioned elsewhere ( here  and  here ), The National Institute on Mental Health issued a \"Request for Information\" asking for input into what kind of autism research should be funded.  The deadline for submissions is near (Jan. 4th).  Responses need to be limited to two pages, and response needs to be to a particular e-mail address (iacc@mail.nih.gov). So put on your thinking caps quickly, get your thoughts together, go to  Kathleen Seidel's site  to see the entire proposal, and get your submissions in.  We all need to make positive contributions to let people know what we expect from our government and private sectors.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismvox.com/this-is-only-the-beginning/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/139/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/139/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/12/now-comes-hard-part.html", "title": "\nNow Comes the Hard Part\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, December 16, 2007", "body": "\nAlthough I consider myself a good general physician, as well as being very good in my chosen specialty, I am neither a psychiatrist nor a pediatrician.  Since this blog deals a lot with issues concerning autism, I don't usually put on my \"doctor\" hat here.  But sometimes some subjects get to me not just as the parent of my autistic son, but also as a physician. The recent episode of the NYU Child Study Center's (together with its director, Dr. Harold Koplewicz)  \"Ransom Notes\" campaign  raises serious ethical concerns that I think need to be addressed.  Kristina Chew over at  Autism Vox  summarized many of the excellent responses by the autism community to these ill conceived ads.  I'm going to address this purely from the perspective of a fellow physician. I have always considered the ability to practice medicine a privilege that is granted me by society.  Having been granted that privilege, I, like all physicians, have certain responsibilities towards not only my own patients, but also to society in general. The American Medical Association, as one of the major professional associations of physicians in the US, publishes Principles of Medical Ethics which all physicians are expected to adhere to.  I'd like to take a few minutes here to review some of what is stated in that document. Here's one section that I found: E-9.123 Disrespect and Derogatory Conduct in the Patient-Physician Relationship   The relationship between patients and physicians is based on trust and should serve to promote patients\u2019 well-being while respecting their dignity and rights. Trust can be established and maintained only when there is mutual respect. Derogatory language or actions on the part of physicians can cause psychological harm to those they target. Also, such language or actions can cause reluctance in members of targeted groups to seek or to trust medical care and thus create an environment that strains relationships among patients, physicians, and the health care team. Therefore, any such conduct is profoundly antithetical to the Principles of Medical Ethics. ... On its  website  NYU's Child Study Center (CSC) gives good lip service to subscribing to the above principle: Our key goals include:     * Increasing the body of scientific knowledge about child mental illness     * Eliminating the stigma of being or having a child with a psychiatric disorder     * Improving the practices of professionals serving children     * Influencing child-related public policy How does that square with the \"Ransom Notes\" campaign, where they have ads such stating things like: We have your son.      We will make sure he will  not be able to care for himself or interact socially as long as he lives. *This is only the beginning.                   Autism Now I might expect something like the above ad twenty years ago, or perhaps now from someone who is totally ignorant regarding current concepts in autism.  But from a major medical center's Department of Child Psychiatry?  Never.  Such rhetoric is blatantly wrong, totally derogatory, and sure to increase discrimination against all autistics.  To hide behind a justification of \"increasing awareness\" is disingenuous at best, and outright lying at worst. The \"Ransom Notes\" campaign is all about publicity.  Whether it's viewed as primarily advertising for NYU's CSC (which I do), or as a public service message, the following  section of the AMA's Principles of Medical Ethics addresses this point. E-5.02 Advertising and Publicity   ...Aggressive, high-pressure advertising and publicity should be avoided if they create unjustified medical expectations or are accompanied by deceptive claims. The key issue, however, is whether advertising or publicity, regardless of format or content, is true and not materially misleading. ... Again, the gross factual inaccuracy of the description of autism renders this ad unethical. When it comes to Psychiatry, the World Psychiatric Association also has some things to say regarding ethics.  This comes from them commenting on psychiatrists and the media: \u2022  Psychiatrists addressing the media. The media has a key role in shaping the attitudes of the community. In all contacts with the media psychiatrists shall ensure that people with mental illness are presented in a manner which preserves their dignity and pride, and which reduces stigma and discrimination against them. An important role of psychiatrists is to advocate for those people who suffer from mental disorders. ... Keep the above in mind while reading this:      We have your daughter. We are making her wash her hands until they are raw, every day. This is only the beginning.                         -OCD ---------------------------- We have taken your son. We have imprisoned him in a maze of darkness with no hope of ever getting out.  Do nothing and see what happens.           -Depression Preserving dignity and pride?  Reducing stigma and discrimination?  Not in my book. Now from Googling Harold Koplewicz and reading about him, before this I wouldn't have thought him a bad guy.  He's written several books, including one titled \"It's Nobody's Fault:New Hope and Help for Difficult Children and Their Parents\".  He's a Vice Dean, Full Professor, and Department Chairman at a prestigious university, and has received numerous awards from various groups, and has appeared often on mainstream media.  He's not some fly by night practitioner of woo that I would expect such claptrap from. But now I'm going to address the good doctor directly. Harold, I may be a simple country doctor in flyover country, but I gotta tell ya.  Your reputation alone isn't going to get you thru this one.  It's time to \"man up\", take the hit, and admit that you got this whole campaign totally wrong.  Everyone can make a mistake, and you made a big one.  Being \"edgy\" doesn't cut it when the ads going out in your name are full of untruths and are frankly unethical in their demeaning portrayal of those with a variety of conditions.  Accept responsibility, apologize sincerely, and go on.  Do so, and people will listen and be willing to start a dialogue with you.  Keep delaying, and this will only get bigger.  You've succeeded in uniting and galvanizing widely disparate groups of people against this campaign, and secondarily against you. Be the physician your record would indicate you have been.  Do the right thing.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.aboutourkids.org/about_us/public_awareness", "http://www.autismvox.com/starting-up-a-dialogue-about-the-ransom-notes-ad-campaign/", "http://www.aboutourkids.org/about_us/overview_history"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/12/ethics-easier-said-than-done.html", "title": "\nEthics-Easier Said than Done\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 27, 2007", "body": "\n In Massachusetts, it's a good day to be a kid.  That is, unless you're an autistic kid. A  story  in today's Boston Herald online edition details how the state legislature is set to debate outlawing spanking of any kind in the state, including in one's own home.  As stated in the article: ...If signed into law, parents would be prohibited from forcefully laying a hand on any child under age 18 unless it was to wrest them from danger, lest they be charged with abuse or neglect. ... This would make Massachusetts the first state in the US to ban spanking.  Massachusetts has long been known to be a very liberal state.  And this proposed ban on spanking is evidence of that bent.  Inexplicably, however, that liberal concern of the state for the welfare of children doesn't exist if you happen to be on the autism spectrum. As  this article  in the online Village Voice pointed out, at the Judge Rotenberg Center in Canton, Massachusetts, administering electric shocks to autistic students in this residential \"school\" is an everyday occurrence. ...The only thing that sets these students apart from kids at any other school in America (aside from their special-ed designation) is the electric wires running from their backpacks to their wrists. Each wire connects to a silver-dollar-sized metal disk strapped with a cloth band to the student's wrist, forearm, abdomen, thigh, or foot. Inside each student's backpack is a battery and a generator, both about the size of a VHS cassette. Each generator is uniquely coded to a single keychain transmitter kept in a clear plastic box labeled with the student's name. Staff members dressed neatly in ties and green aprons keep the boxes hooked to their belts, and their eyes trained on the students' behavior. They stand ready, if they witness a behavior they've been told to target, to flip open the box, press the button, and deliver a painful two-second electrical shock into the student at the end of the wire. ... So, as the Boston Herald notes, laying a hand on a child forcefully in any manner would earn you being charged with abuse or neglect, while in the Judge Rotenberg Center (JRC) withholding food and shocking kids is considered therapy.  And if a small shock doesn't get the desired result, then just increase the level of shock. ...They still withhold food from some students as an aversive, but shocks are their main treatment. The school began using electric shock in 1989, but the device they first used, called SIBIS, was so weak that many students grew accustomed to it, eroding its effectiveness. So Israel developed the GED, which he registered with the Food and Drug Administration in 1995. (The GED was classified in such a way that it only required FDA registration, not approval.) When students grew innured to that, Israel brought forth the GED-4, three times as powerful as the original GED. That version is not registered with the FDA, which now says the Rotenberg Center is exempt because it's only using the machines in-house. ... And although Dr. Israel, the founder and head of the JRC, justifies the use of involuntary shocks because of self injurious violent behavior on the part of students, its use is not limited to that. ...But the GED isn't only used when a life is at stake, or when a student hurts himself or another, but also for \"noncompliance\" or \"simple refusal.\" \"We don't allow individuals just to stay in bed all day,\" says Dr. Robert von Heyn, a Rotenberg clinician, in a video for parents. \"We want to teach people. So we may use the GED to treat noncompliance.\" Other behavior that doesn't appear dangerous also could earn a zap. While it might seem excessive to shock a student for nagging his teacher, Israel asks, what if the kid nags all the time, every minute, every day? The nagging interferes with his learning, so he can't learn self-control and develop normally. JRC's choice is to shock him, stop the nagging, and let him learn. ... As a parent, I am not the biggest proponent to spanking.   Generally speaking, I try my hardest to avoid it, and consider each episode at least partly a failure of parenting on my part.  But I also think that parents need to be given latitude in raising their own children, and that a swat to the butt is not the worst thing in the world. I believe that I know the difference between a swat on the butt and child abuse.  Unfortunately, it would appear that the state of Massachusetts has gotten it entirely backwards.  A swat on the butt will get a parent arrested if this law passes, but starving kids or jolting them with electric shocks for non-compliance in school gets you paid hefty sums of money from the state.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/R0yRg5eXD0I/AAAAAAAAAT4/j8RuYKaz1xo/s1600-h/Taser.jpg", "http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/general/view.bg?articleid=1047241", "http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0641,murphy,74685,6.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/11/spanking-bad-but-shocking-still-ok.html", "title": "\nSpanking Bad, but Shocking Still OK\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 26, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit- urtica creative commons license I've been in a bit of a blogging slump lately.  Part of it is having some problems with Buddy Boy that are consuming some time and energy, part is just general busyness, and part is just not feeling like I had anything to say. Kim over at  MommyHood - The Adventures of Kim and Alex  wrote an entry yesterday on  The culture of too much , which I largely agreed with.  She did a good job of highlighting how all the people that try to sell us stuff have over commercialized Christmas, and we (collectively) fall for this hook, line, and sinker.  I like Kim's blog, as it is both real and funny as all get out.  But one thing in her post got to me.  She lumped my favorite holiday of the year, Thanksgiving, in with this. First, Kim complains about traveling over Thanksgiving: First, there\u2019s too much travel. Too many lineups, too much need to travel from one of the country to the other for the weekend. If you ask anyone what time of the year that they wouldn\u2019t want to be at the airport, it would be Thanksgiving weekend. While I admit that flying over Thanksgiving is not something that ANYONE would like to do, what's so bad about people wanting to reconnect with family to celebrate and give thanks?  I can think of lots of worse ways to spend a weekend.  Too often we get caught up in our own little lives, and the day to day running about.  It's nice to dedicate a day to getting together with loved ones, having a good time, and giving thanks for all the good that we have in our lives.  In the past this meant going down the road to gather at a relative's house.  Now it may mean driving hundreds of miles or flying thousands.  Such is the byproduct of a very mobile society.  But I see it as a good thing that we still make the effort to maintain these familial connections, even though greater effort is involved. Next, Kim attacks the menu: Then there\u2019s Thanksgiving itself. Too much food, too much turkey, too much football. There\u2019s a code that needs to be followed in order to have a proper Thanksgiving. Turkey? Check. Stuffing? Check. Cranberry sauce? Check. Pumpkin pie? Check. Do you eat these foods at any other time of the year, other than potentially Christmas? Probably not, because these are identified as Thanksgiving foods. The Thanksgiving menu is one of my favorites.  I would eat this menu every week, if I could.  I would, however, then weigh upwards of 450 lbs (205 kg./32 stone).  I'm always sorry when the leftover turkey runs out.  Also the leftover pumpkin pie.   The menu of what Americans eat at Thanksgiving is also very regionally based.  Although there are some staples (as mentioned above) that most people have, there are a lot of regional variations, both in what other items are on the menu, as well as how the items are prepared.  I once heard a man interviewed on the radio that had studied this.  He claimed to not only be able to tell you the region of the country you were in by what was on your Thanksgiving menu, in some cases he could pinpoint the actual county that you resided in.  That's pretty impressive. Sure, I overate with everyone else on Thursday.  I know that that's not a good thing, from a health standpoint.  But I see overeating with family one day a year a lot less harmful than the commercialization of Christmas. Thanksgiving is a holiday that I don't have to worry about offending people.  With Christmas, I always have to think first about wishing someone Merry Christmas, so as not to inadvertently offend them (if they're not Christian).  With Thanksgiving, I have no such constraints.  How can anyone object to being thankful? Thanksgiving is the holiday that has been the least commercialized.  Sure, it's good for the airlines and those who produce turkey and cranberry sauce.  And Hallmark and others sell some greeting cards.  But beyond that, there isn't very much commercial hype involved.  In fact, I think that of all of our holidays, Thanksgiving is one that people from a hundred years ago would most identify as being similar to how they celebrated.  So, you can diss what they've done to Christmas, but don't mess with Thanksgiving.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/R0pWNZeXDyI/AAAAAAAAATs/rVqIQIgAd6c/s1600-h/turkey+feather.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/urtica/31822996/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/deed.en", "http://wskrz.wordpress.com/", "http://wskrz.wordpress.com/2007/11/24/the-culture-of-too-much/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/11/why-i-love-thanksgiving.html", "title": "\nWhy I Love Thanksgiving\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, October 23, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit- jurvetson creative commons license So, having read a little bit more about James Watson after reading the comments to my last post, I thought I would add a bit more background about who exactly \"Honest Jim\", as he likes to be referred to, is. Watson was born on the south side of Chicago in 1928, to relatively poor surroundings.  He was accepted to the University of Chicago at the age of 15, and graduated with a degree in zoology.  By this time he was interested in genetics.  In 1948 he started working on a Ph.D. in zoology at Indiana University, working on bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria).  He spent that summer at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which he would later in life lead. Watson's project at Indiana involved using x-rays to inactivate the bacteriophages.  He received his Ph.D. in 1950, and moved to Clare College, Cambridge, where he shared an office with Francis Crick.  They both shared an interest in finding the structure of DNA, and wanted to beat Linus Pauling in being able to do so. Meanwhile, at another London college, Kings College, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin were also working on this problem.  Franklin, a rare female in a male dominated field, preferred to work alone and not share her work too much (perhaps this was rooted in a belief that her work would be \"ripped off\").  She also preferred a methodical approach, waiting to publish findings until they were confirmed. Watson preferred taking chances and a more haphazard approach.  At one point Watson and Crick were given an x-ray diffraction photo of DNA that Franklin had taken with Watson.  Although this was given to them without Franklin's knowledge or consent, it   is debated  whether anything underhanded occurred in this taking place, though by modern standards Watson was at the very least unethical in his treatment of Franklin.  In any event, Watson later acknowledged that when he saw the photo that an \"ah ha!\" moment occurred, enabling him to correctly guess at the structure of DNA. Whether the data was stolen or not, only a minor footnote was made in acknowledgment of Franklin's crucial contribution to Watson and Crick's work.  As Crick (who was friends with Franklin before she died) later  admitted , \"I'm afraid we always used to adopt -- let's say, a patronizing attitude towards her.\" Watson and Crick, as well as Wilkins and Franklin, published articles in the same issue of Nature, describing the structure of DNA.  It is likely that no one at the time knew the far reaching effects that their discovery would entail. In 1962 Watson, Crick, and Wilkins all shared in the Nobel Prize.  The Nobel Prize rules stipulate that all recipients must be alive, and that no more than 3 can share in any one prize.  Conveniently, Rosalind Franklin had died of ovarian cancer in 1958,at the age of 37. I think a few important things are important to look at, in interpreting subsequent actions and remarks made by Watson over the years.  One is the time he spent at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in the summer while at Indiana University.  Another is his making a major scientific discovery at a young age by \"taking chances\", and not working methodically.  Finally, one of Watson's sons is schizophrenic. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) was one of the prime centers of the eugenics movement in America from 1910-1939.  Although that aspect of its nature had been closed down by the time Watson arrived, one may assume that many of the ideas that were promulgated there still existed, and that he would have been exposed to the mish mash mixing of science and racism at a time when he was just beginning to develop intellectually.  A history of eugenics in the US (up to the early 20th century) can be found at the CSHL website  here . After Watson's Nobel Prize, he capitalized on it by publishing 3 textbooks, which made him rich.  To a poor kid from Chicago, this could only have reinforced the advisability of \"taking chances\" and cutting corners when coming out with theories.  His earlier brash methods had payed off, and set him up for life. Watson went on to head Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory.  He was laboratory director from 1968 until he turned 65, in 1994.  From 1994 until 2003 he served as president, and since 2003 he has been chancellor of the lab.  The lab has grown by leaps and bounds under his direction, as he seems to have a flair for attracting donors, as well as having the good fortune to oversee a genetics lab in an age of genetics research.  After this month's debacle of his racist comments in England, the board of directors has removed him from administrative duties as chancellor.  Watson served as head of the NIH human genome project for a time, but was forced out when he objected to the patenting of specific human genes.  While I applaud this position, I suspect that it was taken from an ideological standpoint of wanting to \"perfect\" the human race in as quick a fashion as possible, and not from either an economics or ethical point of view. As was detailed nicely in 2003 by Ralph Brave  here , Watson is a modern day eugenics proponent.  He not only wants to \"cure\" such diseases as autism and stupidity, he wants to inject new genes (from any source-animal, plant, lab made) into human gene lines (so called human germline genetic engineering). As detailed in Brave's post, at a 1998 UCLA conference, Watson said, \"And the other thing, because no one has the guts to say it,\" Watson informed the 1998 conferees, \"if we could make better human beings by knowing how to add genes, why shouldn't we do it? What's wrong with it? Who is telling us not to it?\" This goes far beyond manipulating genes in specific individuals to modify or cure specific disease states.  Watson's firm basis in wanting to \"improve\" the human race, and his wanting to use any method available to make it palatable to the public, is illustrated by the following (also from the Brave article): But what exactly are Watson's eugenics intentions? How would he design better human beings? The germ-line intervention that he and other advocates most often mention is improvements to the immune system. There is a gene, for example, which provides absolute resistance to the AIDS virus. If it were possible to safely implant such a gene into an embryo, who would object? Or a gene that similarly protected someone against SARS or an even more deadly emerging infectious disease? Such germ-line alterations are viewed cynically by Watson, though, as a means to other ends: the wedge that will open the door to further engineering. \"I think that the acceptance of genetic enhancement,\" he writes in his new book, \"will most likely come through efforts to prevent disease.\" The range of potential genetic enhancements at this point is almost entirely a matter of speculation. But Watson is not shy about suggesting his own eugenic targets. In a British documentary on his life and work to be broadcast in the U.S. this fall, Watson announces that he'd like to genetically treat the 10 percent of children whom he considers \"stupid\" and prevent the birth of ugly girls. \"If you really are stupid, I would call that a disease,\" Watson says. Furthermore, \"People say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty. I think it would be great.\" Watson doesn't seem to care if some lives are lost in his quest, and doesn't even flinch from describing himself as a eugenicist: As with other biomedical innovations, even if germline engineering proves successful in other primates, the same technique applied to humans would have unknown results. That's why, Watson writes, \"the start of human experimentation will require resolute courage; the promise of enormous benefit won't be fulfilled except through experiments that will ultimately put some lives at risk.\" \"My view,\" he concludes, \"is that, despite the risks, we should give serious consideration to germ-line gene therapy. I only hope,\" he plaintively appeals, \"that the many biologists who share my opinion will stand tall in the debates to come and not be intimidated by the inevitable criticism ... If such work be called eugenics, then I am a eugenicist.\" It's no wonder that legitimate scientists cringe whenever Watson opens his mouth. Now there is certainly a whole group of scientists that feel that all scientific research should be allowed to proceed, no matter what, and that they should not be shackled by political and ethical concerns.  I heartily disagree with the divorcing of ethics from scientific endeavor (the ultimate example of this would be the experiments undertaken by the  Nazis  and  Japanese  during WWII), but Watson goes even further in his comments.  He finds little nuggets of information in his research, then extrapolates something completely different than what really exists.  It's like looking at chicken nuggets, and deciding that all chickens are flat oval blobs. photo_credit(nuggets)- yoppy , chicken- LollyKnit creative commons license If he had commented only that genetics may show us that some populations are smarter than others, then that might be something that would be worthy of scientific scrutiny and debate.  Legitimate criticisms could be made of tests of intelligence (domains they cover, ways they are administered, bias in interpreting results, etc.).  Also it would be valid to question what purpose there was in even measuring such things.  There will always be a great deal of variation within populations, and even  if  one population were to be shown on average to be more intelligent than another, it would not tell you anything regarding specific individuals. However, Watson can't resist using little scientific nuggets of information to prop up his eugenic racist, sexist, and homophobic utopian vision he probably ingested during his summers at Cold Spring Harbor when he was young.  The comment that got him into trouble most recently was the following: The 79-year-old geneticist said he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really.\" He said he hoped that everyone was equal, but countered that \"people who have to deal with black employees find this not true\". But this isn't the first time Watson has said something so incredibly stupid.  He's had a lot of similar things to say in the past, such as the following  quote  from a BBC documentary in 2003: \"It seems unfair that some people don't get the same opportunity. Once you have a way in which you can improve our children, no one can stop it. It would be stupid not to use it, because someone else will. Those parents who enhance their children, then their children are going to be the ones who dominate the world.\" This is from  an interview  that was published shortly before the most recent dust-up: He talks of the \u201chorror and destruction\u201d of life that can arise from having a severely autistic child, and hopes that by diagnosing autism early, \u201cwe might prevent some [autism-prone] families having subsequent children\u201d. According to this account of a lecture Watson gave at Berkely in October of 2000, Witnesses were flabbergasted when the 72-year-old discoverer of the double helix suggested there was a biochemical link between exposure to sunlight and sexual urges. \"That's why you have Latin lovers,\" Watson said. \"You've never heard of an English lover. Only an English patient.\" In a lecture hall jammed with more than 200 Berkeley students and faculty members, Watson showed a slide of sad-faced model Kate Moss to support his contention that thin people are unhappy and therefore more ambitious. \"Whenever you interview fat people, you feel bad, because you know you're not going to hire them,\" Watson said. I can't find a quote that says so, but it appears that Watson would want to sterilize all people over a certain weight, too. Much of the Cold Spring Harbor Lab's emphasis lately has been on finding the genetic basis of autism and schizophrenia.  Watson's son, Rufus, now 37, has been diagnosed as schizophrenic, and this undoubtedly has been much of the driving force behind Watson's efforts. This year a new \"Psychiatric Genomics Center\" was  founded  at CSHL specifically to study the genetic basis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism.  According to  this article , what Watson would do with genetic information is absolutely clear: And he has publicly revealed that he wishes a genetic test had been available which would have shown that his son Rufus would turn out to have schizophrenia. \"I think I would be a monster to want someone to suffer the way he has... so, yes, I would have aborted him,\" he once said.  While Watson has spent a lot of money and time on trying to find the genetic cause of autism and schizophrenia (so he can prevent anyone that carries these genes from reproducing, and aborting anyone that happens to slip thru the cracks), I did find  one  quote from Watson that I didn't find offensive.  In talking about his son in an interview with  The Guardian  he said: My wife and I have a schizophrenic son. We didn't want to accept this for 30 years, so we put him under great pressure when we shouldn't have. He just wanted to be looked after, and we didn't respect that. We tried to make him independent. If only the vast majority of Watson's life hadn't been spent in trying to \"perfect\" the human race thru eugenics, there might be some hope for him.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RxvW3Oso9EI/AAAAAAAAAR8/oANMaAb5FFE/s1600-h/DNA-secret.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/6791082/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en-us", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin", "http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/do53dn.html", "http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/", "http://www.alternet.org/story/16026/", "http://www.remember.org/educate/medexp.html", "http://www.geocities.com/wallstreet/floor/9597/med.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Rx1FIeso9FI/AAAAAAAAASE/cT9M_sekcCw/s1600-h/chicken-nugget.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Rx1Hcuso9GI/AAAAAAAAASM/kNtXCZ5Sx-Y/s1600-h/chicken.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/spilt-milk/639108699/", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lollyknit/475018996/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en-us", "http://www.darwinawards.com/old/main200306a.html", "http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2630748.ece", "http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/75310.php", "http://www.mindfully.org/GE/2007/James-Watson-Speaks20oct07.htm", "http://education.guardian.co.uk/academicexperts/story/0,,2191666,00.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/10/twisted-life.html", "title": "\nA Twisted Life\n"},

He was supposed to speak in London today to a sold out crowd, but the invitation was withdrawn after some remarks he made. According to a  story  reported online in The International Herald Tribune Oct. 18th, 2007 ...In its profile of Watson, The Sunday Times Magazine quoted him as saying he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 whereas all the testing says not really.\" ... Dr. Watson claims he was misquoted (which  is  a common occurence in the press), and said ...\"I cannot understand how I could have said what I am quoted as having said,\" he said. \"To all those who have drawn the inference from my words that Africa, as a continent, is somehow genetically inferior, I can only apologize unreservedly. That is not what I meant. More importantly from my point of view, there is no scientific basis for such a belief.\" ... And that might be the end of that, except that the good doctor has a history of making other statements, such as ... while he hopes that everyone is equal, \"people who have to deal with black employees find this not true.\" ... ...Watson has caused controversy in the past, reportedly saying that a woman should have the right to abort her unborn child if tests could determine it would be homosexual. He also suggested a link between skin color and sex drive, proposing a theory that black people have higher libidos. ... I think it might be a little harder for Jimmy to wiggle out of those quotes. A quick search of the web brought up some other interesting things Watson has said.  Keep in mind when reading the next quote that Watson is reported to have a son  diagnosed with schizophrenia .  This quote came from  an interview  he gave in 2006. ...\u201cWe can dissect the essence of schizophrenia, bipolarism and autism to find out how the brain doesn\u2019t work. The essense of schizophrenia is the brain can\u2019t function. You are seeing the essence of stupidity. The same systems tweaked slightly the other way will be the essence of intelligence. We can find out why some people can play piano better than others\u2014just a better brain, you have to be bright to play Rachmaninoff. My goal would be in ten years everyone with a mental disease would get DNA diagnosis first.\u201d ...

I think that Dr. Watson is a very good scientist, who has discovered some great things. I also think that just because a person is intelligent, doesn't necessarily mean that they are smart, logical, or compassionate.

All of us had a lot of fun, and the kids didn't even notice when Liz and I were pilfering some of the chocolate for ourselves.

{"date": "Monday, October 15, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit- Todd Baker creative commons license What responsibility does a mainstream paper have for what is published on its online edition?  Either the Chicago Tribune thinks that normal journalistic standards do not apply, or it is extremely lazy when it comes to enforcing them.   For the second time in a month (see my previous entry  here ), the Tribune ran a story on its online edition that was factually unsound, full of scare tactics, and downright kooky regarding autism.  The story,  \"Autism recovery stories: Mercury poisoning?\"  appeared on a Chicago Tribune blog that is part of the  Chicago Tribune web edition.   The story appeared under the byline of Julie Deardorff, who is the writer of the blog \" Julie's Health Club \", which is regularly included in the Tribune's web edition. Now I know that if anyone from the Tribune comes here to comment, they'll most likely say that blogs are expressions of an individual's opinion, and thus are free from the usual requirements of things like the Society of Professional Journalists  Code of Ethics .  And while I feel that the ethics and responsibilities of  personal  blogs are still evolving, and that the public mostly expects that personal blogs will have to be filtered somewhat to figure out what is fact and what is purely personal opinion, I believe that when a journalistic entity (e.g., the Chicago Tribune) puts its imprimatur on a blog and includes it in it's web edition that professional ethics should apply.  Otherwise  all  of what is printed in the Chicago Tribune (whether online or in print) becomes suspect as to its veracity.  Unless of course the Tribune wants to start doing stories on Elvis sightings and Alien abductions, and change its name to the \"Chicago Enquirer\". It's not like the Tribune is linking to random outside blogs of interest.  The blog is one of many hosted on the Tribune's site, and Deardorff, the author of the blog, has a tribune e-mail address-jdeardorff@tribune.com. Deardorff starts out this article repeating some of the same tired old falsehoods regarding mercury and autism. For almost four years, no one could explain to Julie Obradovic why her daughter Eve (left) was suffering from \"non-stop ear and bronchial infections, bladder infections, severe constipation that would leak out in water, eczema, loss of skin coloring (inability to burn or tan), chronic yeast infections, insomnia, seizures and staring spells.\" But when Obradovic, of Homer Glen, Ill., discovered Eve had been exposed to mercury and the symptoms were signs of mercury posioning, she decided to investigate. Here's her story, the fourth in an occasional series that looks at how parents have tried to treat their autistic children.    The very first line from the SPJ's  Code of Ethics  states: \u2014 Test the accuracy of information from all sources and exercise care to avoid inadvertent error. Deliberate distortion is never permissible. Now it wouldn't take much investigation to see that the diagnostic criteria for autism have almost nothing to do with the symptoms stated in that first paragraph of the story.  A quick Google search for \"DSM IV autism criteria\" led me  here .  A quick Google of \"mercury poisoning criteria\" led me to the CDC  here .  A perusal of the two collection of symptoms would quickly let one know that there is very little, if any, overlap at all.  A fairly complete comparison of the two was done by Kevin Leitch and can be found on Wikipedia  here .  Of note, Kevin Leitch doesn't even consider himself a \"professional\" blogger, yet he includes references to scientific articles, whereas Ms. Deardorff does not. Later in the article, Ms. Obradovic continues talking about her daughter's illness: At about age 3 and 1/2, I learned that she was injected with mercury at her most vulnerable stage of development. I didn't really know what to make of that, and decided to investigate. Months later, after exhaustive research, I was able to confirm that almost every single symptom of what was wrong with her was a symptom of mercury poisoning. It absolutely defied logic to believe that was a coincidence.  Ms. Obradovic is obviously referring to the \"controversy\" as to whether the mandatory childhood vaccines (and the low amounts of thimerosal-a form of mercury-that was long ago eliminated from them) cause autism.  But Ms. Deardorff doesn't explain this at all in her article.  Perhaps she thinks if she doesn't point this out that she doesn't have to also explain that all credible scientific evidence refutes this thoroughly. Many credible, well researched, and well documented responses were written to the article, but Ms. Deardorff refused to either retract her post, or even to admit in any way that she had failed miserably in researching the article.   For those that think I'm being too hard on Ms. Deardorff, I return to the fact that hers is not a private blog located randomly on the net, but a blog sponsored and hosted by a major paper in a major US market.  And I would hope that Ms. Deardorff would not claim ignorance of journalistic ethics, as  her bio  states that she has a degree in journalism (as well as an MBA). Even if one feels that all blogs (including those sponsored by a major newspaper) are not subject to the same standards as a newspaper, one might consider what  this online list  of blogger ethics has to say: ...  \u2022 Never publish information they know is inaccurate -- and if publishing questionable information, make it clear it's in doubt.   \u2022 Distinguish between advocacy, commentary and factual information. Even advocacy writing and commentary should not misrepresent fact or context.  ...  \u2022 Admit mistakes and correct them promptly.  ...   \u2022 Disclose conflicts of interest, affiliations, activities and personal agendas.   \u2022 Deny favored treatment to advertisers and special interests and resist their pressure to influence content. When exceptions are made, disclose them fully to readers. ...  Unfortunately, Ms. Deardorff doesn't look good even when her actions are held up to this lesser standard of practice. I hope that the Chicago Tribune is just ignorant of what is happening in its web edition, and has not willfully allowed such unsubstantiated rubbish to be published under its masthead.  The history of the Tribune deserves better, the legitimate journalists on the Tribune deserve better, and most of all, the readers of the Tribune deserve better. n.b.  After I had most of this post written I discovered that  Orac  (who wrote some of those well thought out responses on the Tribune site) had already blogged on this article.  Since I had already written most of mine, I decided to go ahead with this anyway.  I encourage one and all to go to Orac's site and read what he had to say about this. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RxExSOso8_I/AAAAAAAAARU/WF67cueexgc/s1600-h/chicago-tribune.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/technowannabe/251082029/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en-us", "http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/features_julieshealthclub/2007/10/autism-recovery.html#more", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/", "http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/features_julieshealthclub/", "http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RxE37eso9AI/AAAAAAAAARc/hv87ZIZp--g/s1600-h/chicagotribune.com.jpg", "http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp", "http://ani.autistics.org/dsm4-autism.html", "http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/mercury/mercinorgcasedef.asp", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/wiki/Thimerosal/Bernard", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/columnists/chi-julieshealthclub-story,0,3140608.story", "http://www.cyberjournalist.net/news/000215.php", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/10/julie_deardoff_and_the_mercury_militia_d.php"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/10/mainstream-media-and-responsibility_15.html", "title": "\nMainstream Media and Responsibility\n"},

This place is exciting and colorful, but also somewhat scary to her.  She wants to get back home (to normalcy-represented by a dreary black and white Kansas) but doesn't know how to get there.  In her quest to get back home, she is directed to a wizard, who doesn't initially think she has any way of getting back to Kansas, but he doesn't want to disappoint her. The wizard puts on a big pyrotechnics display to show how great he is, gets angry at Dorothy when she questions him at all, and promises her if she just does X (get the wicked witch's broom) then Y (getting to go back to normalcy) will happen.  Wanting desperately to go home, Dorothy does as the wizard says. While it's not a perfect analogy, I often think of autism in terms of this movie.  When parents first find out that there kid is \"different\", they don't stop to look at all the wonderful ways that that difference can be good.  They don't look at all the ways that their child is essentially the same as all other kids, just different.  And so they focus on a quest to \"get back to normalcy\".  In doing so they are guided by a lot of wizards who give false hope to them.  These wizards may or may not believe in their false magic, but promise parents that if \"they only do X\" then they will get back to their precious normalcy. When the magic doesn't work, they are scorned if they question the wizard.  If they do get back to some sense of normalcy, then the magic was obviously responsible. But once in a while a good witch comes along.  One who can show you that you had the capacity to \"go back home\" all along.  All you had to do was look inside yourself to find the person you were, and look at your child and see the person they are.  The good witch helps you to see that Kansas doesn't necessarily have to be a dreary black and white place.  Kansas can be colorful.  There's room in Kansas for all types of people, and if you had looked hard before, you would have seen some of them.   Kevin Leitch is one of those people that have helped to show me that Kansas can be a colorful place, and that we are all the better for it.  He has provided a place for all types of people to congregate, and has helped to show that acceptance and inclusion are the keys to a better society for all of us.

{"date": "Sunday, October 7, 2007", "body": "\n photo by  katielips creative commons license I was perusing a local autism listserve that I am on, and read this message from someone I don't know. I haven't been on here for a while, but wanted to share something that happened today. I recently retired from teaching. My daughter, Amy, who is 35 and on the spectrum, has been my assistant for 16 years, since she graduated from high school. This is on a voluntary basis at a private school. Well, when I retired that meant that Amy was also out of a job. So we decided to look into a sheltered workshop. Amy is use to doing some office work and assisting me with the mundane work that all teachers hate. She has never done production work, but after touring the place she said that she thought she could do the work. Well, I didn't feel that the environment would necessarily be the best for her as she has a tendency to pick up behaviors from those she's around but I didn't express that at the time. But while we were standing in the shop talking to a staff member, a young man came up to us and was obviously attracted to Amy. He ask if she was going to work there and stuck out his hand to shake hands. We shook his hand and introduced ourselves. He said, \"I'm going to ask her out.\" He then reached over and was about to give her a hug when the staff member stopped him and sent him back to his station. Oh, did I mention that Amy is very attractive and outwardly shows no signs of a disability? I couldn't help wonder what would happen if someone wasn't right there. This is my worst nightmare,since Amy is very compliant and vulnerable. So we are back to square one as far as a job for Amy. She's so talented I hate for her just to stay at home all day. Any suggestions?  I wanted to respond with either \"Think you could find a nunnery to lock her up in?\",  \"I think she's old enough to start dating\", or the snarky \"Good thing that staff member was right there, because I'm sure that that evil autistic man would have defiled your daughter on the spot right there, because we all know what hugs lead to\".  But I tick many people off on that list as it is, with my mad ramblings against quackery that some of  them are inflicting on their children, and I would like not to be kicked off so I can show some of the newbies that not all in the \"Autism Community\"(tm)  are off their rocker. Now don't get me wrong, I understand to some extent where this parent is coming from.  My (NT) daughter is only 5, but I am already shopping for a shotgun that I can clean when potential suitors come to call.  I also understand the desire to protect one's autistic offspring from some of the exploitation that society can subject them to.  So I can sympathize with the sentiment that one would want to take some precautions and make some preparations when introducing one's son or daughter to dating. But give me a break!  Her daughter is  35  years old, has worked, can express her own wants and needs, and from the sound of it mom has kept her from exploring any kind of relationships with the opposite sex at all.  I know nothing other than what was written, and I have no idea if this woman's daughter was even interested in dating this man.  But I think she deserves the courtesy of listening to her views on the subject, and she deserves to be in an environment where she can meet and mingle with people of both sexes, so she can form friendships and possible relationships. I have no idea whether my son will ever want to marry (though I do know he likes  blonds ).  But as hard as it may be, I am going to do my darndest to educate my son regarding sex, dating, and relationships with the opposite sex.  I think one of the worst insults I could give him would be to presume that he is incompetent of forming and nurturing a relationship with someone else.  Many in the world treat him as incompetent.  The least I can do is to always presume competence, and do my best to support him. Am I wrong?  And what (if anything) should I post on that list?  In the last two days since that was posted, there have only been suggestions regarding other places to look for employment.  Noone else has questioned her actions.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RwhcXn0V3-I/AAAAAAAAARE/3iWgipT_zo8/s1600-h/party-katielips.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/katielips/12385721/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en-us"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/10/sex-and-single-girl.html", "title": "\nSex and the Single Girl\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 11, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit- D'Arcy Norman creative commons license Recently in the Chicago Tribune a story appeared entitled  \"Autism and the adopted child\" .  I have to admit the title caught my eye, as the father of an adopted child that is autistic.  The story referred to a blog post by a mom by the name of \"Pickel\" that was entitled ' Finally My Son is...\"Finding the Words\"  '. I should have known that my blood pressure was going to rise as I read this story.  The first paragraph starts out: Since we adopted our son from Russia in the summer of 2005 we have struggled with him. From his fingertips to his toenails the child is a medical mystery and developmental mess. Anyone that starts off referring to their son as \"the child\" and as a \"developmental mess\" is digging themselves a hole in my book.  I understand when adoptive parents don't bond immediately with the children they adopt.  But it's been two years!  When will she consider him her son? Did we have any clue when we adopted him? Sure, some. We knew he would be delayed because most institutionalized children are. However, just before he turned 3 the local school district told us that they estimated his developmental age to be between 13 and 18 months. We were floored. Little Pickel has been diagnosed with Institutional Autism, H Pylori, Severe Gastritis, food allergies, Gross and Fine Motor Delay, Receptive and Expressive Speech Delay, Post Traumatic Stress, Separation Anxiety, and Sensory Processing Dysfunction. He has also had three surgeries; ear tubes and 2 GI scopes. He is only 4. Oh, OK, I get it.  This is one of those pity party pieces.  What she really wants to say is \"Poor me!  I didn't get a perfect kid.  I was willing to put up with a couple of weeks of inconvenience, but not two years!\"  Well, life doesn't work that way.  When you sign up to be a parent, \"You get what you get, and you don't throw a fit\" (as they used to say in my son's 1st grade classroom). The first several months with Little Pickel were pure hell. He had night terrors that lasted 45 minutes to an hour every night (he still has these 2-3 times a week). We discovered double ear infections that resulted in ear tubes. We also discovered some creepy crawlers that made the trip home from Russia with us. They were NOT very welcome in our home. Developmentally, he did not progress quickly. By his 3rd birthday he had only about 100 words and could not put phrases or sentences together. He was just beginning to run without looking like an otter (or falling all over himself) and he screamed at me every time he tried to ride his tricycle (because he was so frustrated). OK.  So you rip a two year old from the only home he's ever known.  Talk to him in a language he doesn't understand.  And then  YOU  get upset when he expresses displeasure the only way he knows how, by screaming.  And don't forget to complain that a few bugs came home in your luggage, and that your prize son isn't quarterback material. We tried everything for him. We rid him of his H Pylori (a bacterial infection in his gut), we removed his problem foods (gluten, casein, bananas, oats), and we worked diligently on his sensory issues. Still, he seemed locked in his own world...screaming uncontrollably when things were not right, when I would back up the car instead of go forward, or if he could not have graham crackers to ease his tummy aches. He had orange stools up to 10 times a day, acid reflux, gas that could light the entire house on fire, sleep problems so severe he was getting close to (maybe) 5 hours of sleep a night, no social skills, aggressive behavior so severe that I had to learn to physically restrain him or get hurt myself (or worse, allow him to hurt himself), and bum rashes so horrid we resorted to Bag Balm, a cream used for milking cows. Is there a style manual out there that sets out that in order to describe how horrible your life with your special needs kid is, you have to describe their bowel habits and how violent they are?  Her son had some GERD and food sensitivities, as well as the aforementioned ear problems.  So do tons of other kids.  So what?  There's also lots of other things that kids have.  Things such as asthma, physical disabilities, learning disabilities and emotional problems.  That's life.  Deal with it. So, when we moved back to Chicago in the summer of 2006 from Russia it was like a weight had been lifted. He qualified for Early Childhood, we found the Pfeiffer Treatment Center and started him on a vitamin chelation* to rid him of his heavy metals, yeast, and to balance his bacteria, and our parents were both there to help us with him. Since our move Little Pickel has thrived. One might say he is \"Finding the Words\". I have said many times on my blog, Discussing Autism, that there is no cure for Autism. Because Little Pickel's diagnosis is Institutional Autism and not organic autism, he can be \"cured\" and he can recover.  Unfortunately, there are hundreds of thousands of children with autism who will not be cured. Now this is why I'm writing this post.  Pickel comes out and says that her \"Little Pickel\" didn't have autism as a result of being poisoned by vaccines (he had 'institutional autism', which is supposed to be caused by gross neglect and lack of physical stimulation, not by toxins of any sort), but she goes ahead and takes him to someone who treats him with the same hocus pocus that they would use to remove all of the \"toxins\" from him.  What sort of  \"magical thinking\"  is going on here?Why would anyone (parent or practitioner) do that?  I mean, unless you were so totally corrupt as a practitioner that you would try to sell your wares to someone when even your standard goofy arguments (your kids were poisoned by vaccines/heavy metals/whatever) cleary didn't apply.  And at the same time you have parents that are clearly so dumb as to accept that even though the cause of your kid's autism is totally different, you'll still use the same goofy treatments. However, there are some children like Little Pickel who have been cured...and they have Autism. The documentary, \"Finding the Words\"  is their story. It is the story of eight \"perfect babies\", each given a grim diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as toddlers, whose grieving families fight prejudice, misinformation, and despair to get their children well again. Written and produced by Elizabeth Horn Nelson, the documentary has really picked up steam because there are parents out there like me who have hope. Horn Nelson is also the co-founder and president of the Autism Recovery Consortium and even the  Huffington Post picks her up. You can view the trailer for the documentary here I'm sorry, which is it, Pickel? That you can't cure autism, or that you can?  I love it when people can't even keep their stories straight. According to Nelson Horn in a 2005 interview, \"The first impression you get with this diagnosis is that you're on your own,'' Horn said. \"Even though there were resources, there was no sense of direction anyone could give as to how to proceed.'' For over a year that is how we felt with Little Pickel. Then, when we had no where else to turn we found The Pfeiffer Treatment Center and finally got our answers. They were the only facility willing to perform biomedical testing for us. You can read a very scientific explanation here. How much is Little Pickel talking now that we did a vitamin chelation? So much so that there are times he won't shut up! (Perhaps he should try out for \"Autism, the Musical!\") He is constantly chattering about going to school and how much he likes his new teacher. He sings \"Twinkle-Twinkle\" loud and out of key as he is falling asleep. He is finally asking questions (but everyone is labeled as a she). And occasionally from across the room or from upstairs I hear him yell...\"Marcie, come here!\" in a sing-sing song voice.  Could you punish a kid for that?\" Perhaps this is why so many people fall for all of the hocus pocus \"cures\" that are out there.  They are uncomfortable with uncertainty.  They can't handle that no one can tell them a definite reason that there child is autistic, and worse, that they can't offer them a cure.  So when hucksters come along with \"magic pills\" that will make their kids all better they jump at it.  It's reassuring.  It gives you hope.  And when you go to the doctor's office you have a built in pity party support group, where you can all play the game of trying to top each other in the \"My life is worse than yours\" game. The only problem is that it's all a big house of mirrors.  And to waste large portions of your time and money on such things is at best silly, and at worst abusive to your child who is getting unneccessary and unproven treatments.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Rw1Teuso8-I/AAAAAAAAARM/mgUKIlsLTog/s1600-h/Magic.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/dnorman/364193342/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en-us", "http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/features_julieshealthclub/2007/09/autism-and-the-.html", "http://svmomblog.typepad.com/chicago_moms/2007/09/finding-the-wor.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/10/magical-thinking.html", "title": "\nMagical Thinking\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 4, 2007", "body": "\n These are the words that come out of 4 out of 5 people's mouths when they first meet our daughter, and it's been bugging Liz and I.  It's not something that we think about every minute of every day, it's just one of those little things that bug us. Why, you ask? Well, we've asked ourselves the same question.  Why does this comment rankle us and just not feel right?  It's not that she's an ugly kid.  In fact, she  is  very cute (you'll have to take my word for it, as I'm not going to post pics here that would fully identify her).  She has a smile that lights up a room, and enough social skills that she could compete with a politician in working a room.  And we don't dress her like she's in a beauty pageant.  So what's so wrong about pointing out that she's a good looking kid? Well, for one thing she's only 5 years old.  And people have been saying this for at least the last 2 years.  And I just don't think it's appropriate to talk about really young girls as \"beautiful\".  At least not when you first lay eyes on them.  There's something in the comment that just sexualizes this young child by referring to her as beautiful.  I mean, isn't there anything else that you might say?  Like \"She has a nice smile\", \"My, she's well behaved\", or just \"Hi, Sweet Pea!\".  OK, so most days they'd be stretching the truth if they said she was well behaved, but we wouldn't mind. Unfortunately, we think that that the base reason that people say this probably doesn't have to do with people purposely trying to make her a sexual object, but it's just as bad.  We've come to the conclusion that people do this because we are white and Sweet Pea isn't (we are a family thru adoption-both of our kids are bi-racial African-American/Caucasian).  So when people first encounter Sweet Pea being introduced as our daughter, they're naturally a bit taken back.  I get that.  She doesn't exactly look like us.  So while they're feeling awkward they feel the need to say something nice, and so come out with the \"She's so beautiful\" comment.  While I don't really think people are trying to be malicious, I wonder why this particular comment comes out.  I suspect that it might have to do with the \"unofficial racial preference rank order for adoption\", which places relatively more value (in decreasing order) on kids that are white, asian, hispanic, and finally African-American.  Being of mixed race (with half being Caucasian) bumps you up a half notch.  So I think a big part of this comment thing is just people feeling sorry for us that we adopted kids that were of \"lower preference\", and wanting to say something to make us feel better. Thus far Liz and I just usually mumble something non-committal, and go on from there.  We don't think that people are consciously being rude, so don't make a big deal out of it.  We sometimes think that maybe we're just being overly sensitive, but the comment just has never felt right.  So, dear readers, let me know what you think.  And if you ever happen to meet us on the street, you now know what  not  to say.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RwVVqH0V39I/AAAAAAAAAQ8/z9CS1ujvsB8/s1600-h/Jon+Bonet.jpg"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/10/shes-so-beautiful.html", "title": "\nShe's So Beautiful\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 27, 2007", "body": "\n What happens after high school? That's one of many questions that many of us that have kids with disabilities think of.  Will our kids be able to go to college, get a job, live independently?  Will they be happy? Two young people with disabilities enrolled in Florissant Valley Community College in the St. Louis, Missouri, USA area.  They had hopes, dreams, and scholarships they had earned during high school.  What happened to them is detailed in a story found  here . ...It happened to Jennifer Adelsberger two years ago. She attended Florissant Valley for four years and was close to getting her associates degree in early childhood education. She has disabilities, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and has difficulty in reading comprehension. But, with help, she graduated from McCluer North High School. However, at Florissant Valley, Adelsberger couldn't get her degree because her advisor, she says, told her that she would not be able to graduate. She needs four classes to get her degree; a math class, two in student teaching and a fourth in class training with children. After she was told she wouldn't be able to pass those classes, she left school and has been looking for work since. Her father, Larry, says she's had her heart set on being a teaching assistant, working with young children, and what happened at Florissant Valley has affected her outlook and personality. ... It would appear that the math class is the stumbling block.  I find it hard to believe that the school can't identify a tutor that could help her to get thru that one class.  I'm  sure  it couldn't possibly be that this young woman looks and talks a little different from the norm, and they didn't want her student teaching.  Surely there is no other discrimination involved.  This is born out by looking at the other case, in which things seemed to start out just fine: ...For Jeremy Andert, the fall at Florissant Valley was much quicker. He too had an A+ scholarship and he graduated from Hazelwood West High School in the spring of 2006. In the Fall, he began at Florissant Valley, taking just a remedial reading class and physical education. It was to be an easy transition from high school to the rigors of college.  He was doing well in reading and physical education. In fact, his teacher had written him a mid-term report, indicating he was passing the class and was succeeding in school. ... It sounds like Jeremy was approaching things in a realistic manner, and things were going well.  His mom thought he was doing well, too (who wouldn't, having been given the satisfactory mid-term report).   ...However his mother, Cathy Andert, had a meeting with a school advisor, who told a different story. Cathy says the advisor told her that she didn't care to have \"retarded\" students in her classes and she wasn't \"having\" it. Cathy says she was taken aback by those comments.  ... I think I would have been more than \"taken aback\" by those comments.  Ms. Andert was much kinder than I would have been.  The school, for its part, offered this lame response: ...Laura Sternman, a vice president of student affairs at Florissant Valley, says such comments are not the college's \"attitude\" taken on campus. Sternman says the college does all it can to help disabled students, saying the school is \"very proactive\" when it comes to such help. ... Actions speak louder than words, and Florissant Valley's actions speak volumes.  And so does its web site, where you can follow a link from  this page  called  \u201cYou Should Know the Difference Between High School and College for Students With Disabilities.\u201d  There are things written there, such as  A college education is a privilege instead of a right and special programs are not required Students are responsible for their own behavior and inappropriate behavior is not tolerated Students are expected to do the same work in the same time frame as all students These hardly seem consistent with an institution that says it is doing all it can to assist disabled students. For those that are not in the US, community colleges are 2 year public institutions that offer lesser than bachelor degrees, usually \"Associate of Arts\" degrees.  Students can pursue various courses of study there, or use it as a stepping stone to a four year institution.  As can be gleaned from the above, education at the college level is not governed by the same sets of rules that apply to education up to that point. Various people on the web have commented regarding how some colleges in some instances are providing accomodations for students with special needs.  But it appears that their legal responsibility is only to supply equal access (things like physical access, access for guide dogs, etc.), and there is no requirement for them to accommodate developmental or behavioral disabilities. While some colleges seem to have greater outreach than others, it appears that at least some people at Florissant Valley Community College feel so emboldened that they can say that they don't want to have to deal with 'retarded' students in their classes.

{"date": "Thursday, September 13, 2007", "body": "\n And by a 7 year old, no less.  I don't know if I should be happy about this or not.  I was totally flim-flammed by Buddy Boy tonight. Let me back up a bit.  Buddy Boy has been getting into playing computer games, as well as games on a Game Boy that we bought about 6 months ago.  I'm sure that many of you are very familiar with the concept of using \"electronic bribery\" in order to encourage certain behaviors (reading, doing math problems, cleaning room, etc.).  Well, not being perfect parents, we also are not above using time on the computer/Game Boy in this manner.  The combination of his obsession with our limiting  access has made time on electronic games very desirable to Buddy Boy. If left to his own devices, Buddy Boy would play electronic games every waking minute we let him.  Obviously, being an old fart who's first computer game was  \"Pong\"  in high school, I don't think that's very healthy. I'm the one who usually puts Buddy Boy to bed at night.  We put him to bed at 7:00 PM, as he will consistently get up between 5:00 and 5:30 AM, no matter how late he goes to bed, and we want him to get a good night's sleep.   I put Buddy Boy to bed at the usual time.  We went thru our usual bedtime routine, making sure he went to the bathroom and brushed his teeth, picking out what song he was going to listen to on his \"boombox\" all night long, tucking him in.  Prior to bedtime Buddy Boy had elected to play in his room by himself, not wanting to play with me or Sweet Pea.  When I left him to go and play hide and seek with Sweet Pea he was laying under his bed playing with some small squishy animal figures. I didn't see the Game Boy, and asked him where it was.  He straight faced said \"I don't know, Dad\".  I proceeded to take 3-4 minutes to search for it in his bedroom, but couldn't find it, so just left, as I didn't want to break our routine too much. Liz has been the one to usually take him to the bathroom later, after a couple of hours.  She's taken over this duty from me, as she thinks my  whispering to him  at these times wakes him up and makes it harder for him to get back to sleep. Well Liz went in to take him to the bathroom tonight, and he was laying under his bed playing on his Game Boy.  He evidently had sequestered it away someplace near bedtime, and had been playing it from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM, when Liz went in there. Liz wasn't too happy with me. This isn't the first time Buddy Boy has lied about something, and I certainly don't want him to make a habit out of it.  But as I sit here contemplating this, I've got to think that the ability to plan out the operation, lie to my face when directly challenged, and carry it out quietly shows some real skills that could transfer quite nicely to a lot of workplaces. Now if I can only work on some effective strategies for him to remember faces of people he's met...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Rui49Jt58vI/AAAAAAAAAQY/wwV0JgJUoBg/s1600-h/Game-Boy.jpg", "http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=ConsoleMuseum.Detail&id=3&game=12"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/09/hoodwinked.html", "title": "\nHoodwinked\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 21, 2007", "body": "\n That was the question I asked myself when I read  the story  of Sophie Currier, an MD/PhD graduate of Harvard University who is asking for additional break time during testing for her medical license because she is breastfeeding. The test that Currier is taking is the USMLE Step 2, a nine hour test that is the second of three tests that are necessary to become a fully licensed physician.  A physician must pass at least the first two steps prior to starting their residency training.  This test is usually taken one year prior to completing one's medical school education.  That way, if you are not successful the first time, you have another chance to take the exam the following year, prior to starting residency.  Evidently Dr. Currier took the test when she was 8.5 months pregnant the first time, and failed by a few points.  If she doesn't pass the test this time, she'll have to delay starting residency for at least another year, until she passes the test. I have a lot of sympathy for physician/mothers.  Both jobs are very time consuming and tough, and juggling two full time jobs is next to impossible.  One of my heroes during my internship year was a fellow intern who was a single mom to a 2 year old (her husband couldn't handle having a wife that was \"smarter\" than he was, so left her when she was in med school).  We all tried to pitch in and help her out, but there was no doubt that that doctor mom fully pulled her share.  She asked normal favors of us (as all friends would), but never asked for any special considerations because of her situation. So my first inclination when reading the story was to think \"Why couldn't the board give her some extra time to pump during the test?  It's a 9 hour test, with only 45 minutes allocated to break time.  Surely they could make some accommodation.  I mean, this can't be a unique situation.\"  But then I continued reading the article: ...Currier has already received special accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act for dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, including being granted permission to take the test over two days instead of one. In the lawsuit, she was seeking an additional 60-minute break on each day. The board cited the need to be consistent in the amount of time given to doctoral candidates and said other nursing mothers who have taken the exam have found the 45 minutes of permitted break time sufficient. ... I'm all in favor of her getting accommodations for her dyslexia and ADHD.  But it appears that since she'll be taking the test over two days instead of one, then she'll have 4 hours of testing on one day, and 5 hours on another.  She still has 45 minutes of break time that she can allocate over that time, to take when she wants. This may not be the extra hour of break time each day that she wants, but it appears on the surface to not interfere too badly with her breast feeding requirement of having to pump or feed every 3 hours.  Also: ...The judge said the board offered Currier several special accommodations, including a separate testing room where she could express milk during the test or during break time, and the option to leave the test center to breast-feed during break times. ... For its part, the USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Examination board) responded publicly  on its website  to the \"Currier question\" regarding breastfeeding during exams. ... How have you responded to Sophie Currier\u2019s request for extra time to express milk? As the papers filed in court show, NBME offered Ms. Currier a variety of comfort measures and personal item exceptions, such as permission to bring multiple, assembled pumps to eliminate the time involved in cleaning, assembling, and disassembling them; permission to pump milk while taking the test and on break time, with privacy within the constraints of exam security, in the individual testing room that she receives on account of her ADA disability. We also provided her with a sample schedule demonstrating how an examinee can flexibly manage the time to take a 20- to 30-minute break every three hours. ... And I gotta tell ya, that's starting to sound pretty fair to me.  But to give myself a little reality check before I ran my mouth off (since I am male, and therefore have never faced such a situation) I bounced this question off of a colleague of mine, herself an MD/PhD, who has small children and has breast fed.  After thinking a bit, and without me even telling her the part about her getting to take the test over two days, she felt that the medical board had gone far enough.  Indeed, she didn't even think they had to go that far.  \"Whisper Pump.\", she said.  To my blank look, she explained that the  Whisper Pump  is a wearable bra/pump contraption that you can wear while you work.  It takes about 5 minutes to rig up, and pumps while you work.  So it appears that Dr. Currier might not need any extra time at all in order to take the test and also pump. I gotta tell ya, it feels a little uncomfortable arguing  against  someone getting an accommodation they say they need, especially when I have not walked in that person's shoes.  But this one doesn't seem to pass the sniff test, and it would appear to me that Dr. Currier would spend her limited time better studying for her exam, rather than talking to her lawyer.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RvM1zX0V36I/AAAAAAAAAQg/pKcB3Kvj00c/s1600-h/test.jpg", "http://apnews.myway.com/article/20070920/D8ROUEKO0.html", "http://www.nbme.org/about/BF-USMLE.html", "http://www.whisperwear.com/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/09/how-much-accommodation-is-enough.html", "title": "\nHow much accommodation is enough?\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 12, 2007", "body": "\n Well, it's been about two and a half weeks since the kids have gone back to school.  We keep waiting for phone calls, frantic notes, or disparaging comments, but haven't had them.  We think things are going (mostly) OK.   Buddy Boy starts this year in a self-contained \"communications\" classroom for about 2/3 of the day, with him going out to \"specials\" (art, music, computer, Spanish) with his gen-ed peers, accompanied by an aide.  This is more time out of the self-contained class than he had last year, and we think this is a good thing.  I don't think that inclusion is the end all and be all for everyone, and don't think that Buddy Boy would thrive if he was in the gen-ed class all day at this point.  But we do feel that it's a good thing for him to get to know his NT peers (and them him), and to spend some time interacting with them. His teacher in his communications classroom is one of his former aides from last year, who is now a teacher.  She seems fairly eager to try to please us, and appears to be working hard, but it is also apparent that she is in a bit over her head (somewhat disorganized, frazzled at times).  But her heart seems to be in the right place, and she seems willing to talk with us on how to improve things, so we're trying not to push too hard (don't want to make her jaded in the first semester on her own). We have discovered a few problems, like the fact that Buddy Boy was getting 60 minutes of math instruction/week, vs. 300 minutes/week in the gen-ed class.  This was totally unacceptable to us, and we're working with his teacher to get it a bit more equitable.  Even though we work academics with Buddy Boy on a year round basis, we don't want him set up to fail by not challenging him appropriately academically. There was also a problem with them reporting that he sometimes did not go to his proper classroom after being dropped off in the morning (all children have to be dropped off at the door-no parents can come inside).  We countered (with a letter of support from his pediatrician) that it was unreasonable to expect him to always go directly to his class without getting distracted along the way, and that since we couldn't walk him to his class, they should have someone meet him at the door.  They now do. A more serious problem was when we discovered that they were \"not exactly communicating well\" with us.  Buddy Boy was supposed to (according to a written agreement) supposed to be included for 15 minutes/day in the morning with the gen-ed class with an aide.  His papers have been coming home indicating each day that he attended that class and was doing his work OK.  It turns out that Buddy Boy told Liz last week that he wasn't going to that class in the morning.  When his teacher was asked about this, she said something to the effect of \"Well, he wouldn't settle down during that time period, and was disturbing the other kids, so we put him back in the communications room and he did the work there.\" ARRRGGGHH!   We can understand that if he's consistently disruptive, and after various strategies have been tried, that it may be determined that it's not the right place for him. We've tried suggesting a later time of the day, but we think that they don't have an aide to accompany him at other times, so this is why they picked first thing in the morning.  We've also suggested they give him some time when the other kids aren't in there to just explore the room, but don't think they've done that.  We aren't opposed to having them try different strategies, and even understand if he's temporarily removed.  But to keep sending home slips saying he's going to the gen-ed class, and  not indicating anything wrong, just irks us to no end.  And it makes me wonder what else they're not telling us.  But since he did mostly well for the second part of last year at this school, and everyone we talk too says he's doing OK, we're just writing it off to a communication breakdown at this point, and not getting into conspiracy theories. Buddy Boy generally says that he feels good about school.  But one thing I have noticed is a little increase in Buddy Boy's stress levels.  He's acting out a little aggressively at home (soft head butts, slaps, and threatening language).  It's nothing like he used to do, and he immediately reels it in when we call him on it, so I'm not too worried at this point.  Everyone's entitled to a little extra stress when they start a new school year, start a new job, or anything else that's generally considered stressful. Sweet Pea, meanwhile, has had a fantastic start to Kindergarten.  She goes to school for the full day, and reports back excitedly each day what she's done, as well as who did what in school. So all in all, I think things are going to be OK.  We're going to keep a close eye on things, but as long as the teachers are willing to work with us, we'll keep working with them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RucM6Lc_K2I/AAAAAAAAAQI/jG4qw2xQxMY/s1600-h/OB-School.JPG"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/09/mostly-good.html", "title": "\nMostly Good\n"},
{"date": "Monday, August 27, 2007", "body": "\n A couple of weeks ago I was catching up reading posts on a list that I am on (which has nothing to do with autism).  While doing so, I followed a link to an article about the virtual world,  Second Life . This article intrigued me, for a number of different reasons.  Buddy Boy, over the last 4-6 months, has gotten interested in playing computer games.  For now this has been limited mostly to a \"Monster's Inc.\" game where you basically roam around, gather energy, and smash things, or a couple of \"Game Boy\" games that we have gotten for him.  Occasionally he'll branch out into other online games, but the Monster's Inc. and Game Boy have gotten the bulk of his attention.  As his interest and time has expanded we have found it necessary to limit his time on the computer somewhat, otherwise he would gladly spend upwards of 8 hours playing on the computer. Another reason that I was intrigued by this is that the small amount of research I am involved in involves validating simulations as testing tools in medicine.  Most of our simulations utilize computer controlled mannequins, but there are other research groups that are starting to explore simulations in virtual worlds.  I have worked with simulations for more than 10 years, and I have seen people learn things during simulation that they then carry over into the real one. Finally, the thing that got me hooked and following other links to read more about Second Life was a reference to an \"island\" created in Second Life solely devoted to Aspies and their caregivers. But back to basics.  \"What's a virtual world?\" you ask.  At it's most basic level, it's a bunch of servers hosted by a company called Linden Labs.  It's not really a game, as there are no points to be gained, or declared winners.  Second Life has an introduction on its web site that says the following:  Welcome to Second Life. We are a global community working together to build a new online space for  creativity, collaboration, commerce, and entertainment. We strive to bridge cultures and welcome diversity. We believe in free expression, compassion and tolerance as the foundation for community in this new world.  Sounds good so far.  One can join for free, but if you want to \"own land\" in Second Life, or start a business there, then you need to pay a fee (upfront costs as well as monthly maintenance).  People make money there (commerce is carried on using \"Linden dollars\",  which can be exchanged with U.S. dollars.  As  this article  reports, companies such as IBM have a presence there, and some universities are  teaching classes  there. John Lester, a researcher at Harvard University, has started a private island in Second Life called  Brigadoon .  This island is a place for those with Asperger's syndrome and their caregivers.  My impression is that Lester is using this as part of a research project. Basically I have mixed feelings about Second Life (and granted, I have not signed up and visited there-like I need  another  thing to take up my time).  On the one hand, I can easily see any kid getting so involved in a virtual world that they ignore their responsibilities in the real one.  On the other hand, having seen how skills learned during simulations can carry over into the rest of a person's life, I can see where a person might pick up socialization skills in a virtual world that could carry over.  On the third hand, I'm sure that for people that are much more comfortable communicating via computer rather than f2f (face to face) it can be nice to have some online friends that share your outlook and interests when you might not find that locally. So I'm soliciting opinions from others as to what they think about virtual worlds.  Let me know what you think.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RtD0Ebc_KyI/AAAAAAAAAOw/bLXcjz8GCQE/s1600-h/second%2520life.jpg", "http://secondlife.com/", "http://money.cnn.com/2006/11/09/technology/fastforward_secondlife.fortune/index.htm?postversion=2006111016", "http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2007-08-01-second-life_N.htm", "http://braintalk.blogs.com/brigadoon/2005/01/about_brigadoon.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/08/better-than-reality.html", "title": "\nBetter than reality?\n"},

Meanwhile, much more down to earth (in oh so many ways) was  a story  recounting how a brother of an autistic person and some of his friends just finished roller blading from Florida to Maine in the U.S. (2000 miles/3200 km) to raise funds and awareness about autism.  Their group they formed is called  \"Rolling for Autism\" . Dan Tatar (whose brother Ben is autistic) and four friends from Union College in Schenectady, N.Y. made some comments at the finish line of their journey: ...\"It's not a disease; it's not an illness. It's something that a lot of people have. They're interesting people; they're great people. The support network of their families and friends is incredible. That's why these people are so successful,\" he said, as his brother Ben hollered \"Yeah!\" to the crowd. ...  One of the above stories will be picked up by major news outlets, and the other, while it had significant support from a number of individuals and groups, is likely destined to be seen by a much smaller audience.

{"date": "Friday, August 24, 2007", "body": "\n 3 days ago  Ang  dropped by my blog and commented on my  vacation travelogue : Enjoyed reading about your vacation. We kicked around a Colorado road trip this summer as well, but were concerned about the sensory stuff associated with elevation changes. (Ended up going to St. Louis instead). I'd be interested in knowing if Buddy Boy had any problems? Or does he generally not have sensory issues anyway?  I almost replied that \"No, Buddy Boy doesn's have any sensory issues.\"  Then after a bit I thought, well no, he doesn't  really  have any sensory issues, if you don't count things like when he orders grits and sausage (one of the few restaurant foods he'll eat) the grits have to be the right consistency.  Or the fact that when he gets stressed a bit, he reverts to chewing on things (something that he doesn't do nearly as much as he used to. Or that the sun bothers him when it's too bright, the music's too loud when he doesn't like it, too soft when he does, and yeah, he's not wild about clearing his ears to equalize at altitude. But a couple of things stand out.  One, that all of these things are worlds easier to manage (both for himself as well as us) than they used to be.  And two, that we really don't notice them much anymore.  They're just part of who he is, and how he is.  And accomodating him and what sensitivities he does have is not that big a deal, and comes naturally.   We plan ahead and let him pick which of his stuffed toys to take with him as a comfort item.  I always carry a few extra McDonald's straws in the car (they're thicker and heavier than other restaurant's straws, and hold up better for chewing).  His soft sweatshirt jacket is left in the open in the car, so that he can lay on it as need be (or escape under it).  Although we give him gum to chew as we climb in the mountains, the first time his ears are about to pop he gets anxious.  We've talked about it ahead of time, though, and subsequent times are weathered quite well by him. So I guess the bottom line is, Buddy Boy is not nearly as sensitive as he used to be, he's gotten better at figuring out ways to help himself and communicating to us how to help him, and we've gotten better at anticipating things that might need amelioration. So there aren't any issues, after all.  I was right to begin with.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Rs4zZrc_KxI/AAAAAAAAAOo/fdATj6akv38/s1600-h/IMG_0507.JPG", "http://angthinksshesfunny.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/08/sensory-issues.html", "title": "\nSensory Issues\n"},
{"date": "Monday, August 20, 2007", "body": "\n It's been just over a week since we returned from vacationing (holiday) in Colorado (Southwestern U.S.)  We're all getting settled back in and readying ourselves for the kids returning to school tomorrow (Buddy Boy to 2nd grade, Sweet Pea to Kindergarten). When I was a kid our family took a camping trip every summer (usually for two weeks).  We traveled all over the U.S. and Canada.  It was a great way to have fun, see some scenery, meet great people, and learn some geography and history without really trying.  I never appreciated how great those trips were at the time, but I do now, and hope to pass some of the same memories along to my own kids.  Because of time constraints at work, I'm usually limited to only one week off at a time, but it's still great to take a trip with the whole family.  Liz refuses to camp, but it's still fun even if you're staying in a motel or condo. We loaded up the \"family truckster\" and left early on Saturday morning.  Although in an ideal world the kids would both gaze placidly out at the scenery all day and not get in any fights, we decided to serve the sanity of all involved, and bought a portable DVD player for the car.  It's better than drugging them, and has the advantage of being legal.  We drove for 11 hours the first day, and got as far as Limon, Colorado.  That's about 760 miles (1216 km) with a 7 and 5 year old.  While not perfect, the DVD player worked wonders in inducing a trance like state for hours at a time.  While I still don't believe in its routine use in the car, I must say I now understand those  parents that do. There isn't much to see or do in Limon (apologies to any Limonites), and we  pressed on the next morning another 380 miles (608 km) to Durango, CO, which was going to be our base for the week.  We got there early enough that we were able to get some time in in the pool.  We stayed at a condominium complex which was OK, if a bit dated. One of the first things we did in the area was to explore Mesa Verde national park.  This park is noted for being the site of many cliff dwellings left by the Anasazi Native American tribes.  We always think of America as a young country, and tend to forget that there were people here a long time ago.  The Anasazi came to Mesa Verde in about 600 A.D.  First they dwelled in huts dug in the ground, while the cliff dwellings pictured were probably built in the 1200's.  The Anasazi left this area for unknown reasons near the end of the 1200's.  We're always ensured of getting a lot of knowledge out of guided tours, as Buddy Boy can't help but ask at least 3 questions every 5 minutes (even though we prompt him to take turns and let others also ask).  He does ask some good questions, though. We had to hike a couple of miles to get to the ruins, but the kids held up well, and it was well worth it.  The kids also did well on some other hikes we took during the week.  They collected a bunch of rocks which they ended up stuffing first in their pockets, and later in the cupholders in the car. What would a trip to mining country be without panning for gold.  We took a couple of off road jeep trails, and besides seeing some great scenery we also caught a little \"gold fever\" while panning for gold.  The temperatures during the day were in the high 80's to mid '90's (31-35 degrees C) around Durango, which is at 6500' (1980 meters), but it dropped into the 60's to 70's (16-22 C) when we were on some of the trails that went up as far as 13,000 feet (3962 meters). We drove up to Silverton (an old mining town) instead of taking the historic narrow gauge train because the train trip takes 3.5 hours (rather than a little over an hour driving).  We love old trains, but didn't think the kids would be up for that long sitting on the train.  Once there we explored some ghost towns out of town, as well as saw some alpine meadows and drove by some snow. The trip (like all good things) came to an end much too soon.  Before we knew it we had to fire up the DVD player for the trip back home.  The only casualty on the trip was a headphone cord that got chewed thru, which was spot repaired with a band-aid (plaster). Now we need to start planning next year's trip!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RsjTcrc_KqI/AAAAAAAAANw/Ugzl_92_4I0/s1600-h/IMG_0431.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Rsjc27c_KrI/AAAAAAAAAN4/U4ApV3qUqEM/s1600-h/IMG_0378.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RskCNLc_KsI/AAAAAAAAAOA/m-H2Q4DU-DI/s1600-h/IMG_0398.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RskGLbc_KuI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/ewTgMxGXoNc/s1600-h/Pan-Gold.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RskKd7c_KvI/AAAAAAAAAOY/NnQzj0wa-Sw/s1600-h/IMG_0444.JPG"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/08/travelogue.html", "title": "\nTravelogue\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, August 18, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit-  J.Star Why is it that it seems that only the worst of American culture is exported from its shores?  It's no wonder to me that America and Americans are villified around the world, when it seems the best we can export are the likes of Britney Spears and Michael Jackson. But it seems that we have sunken to a new low.  I've touched  before  on the abominable treatment that goes on at the  Judge Rotenberg center (JRC) in Massachusetts, where electric shocks and other tortures are used on autistics in order to \"train\" them not to misbehave. Now it seems that it's not enough to have this shameful treatment here in the states.  We have to try to drag the rest of the world down with us.  An  article  that appeared this week on  NineMSN  out of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia looks at the electric shock treatment that's used at the Judge Rotenberg Center, and asks parents of Australian autistics if they think it's a viable treatment option. For those unfamiliar with the electric shock treatments used at the JRC, for \"clients\" that are sent there by their parents, after a period of time where positive incentives fail to decrease undesired behaviors, electrodes are placed on the students (after obtaining parental and court approval) and the students are shocked whenever \"bad\" behavior is exhibited. Dr. Matthew Israel, the instigator and chief proponent of the use of \"negative aversives\" at the JRC was interviewed for the Australian article. \"The real torture is what these children are subjected to if they don't have this program,\" said Dr Israel. Autistic children in the program do not suffer any long-term side effects, according to Dr Israel. \"\u2026it has absolutely no side effects and is extremely effective as a corrective procedure to encourage children not to show violent behaviour,\" he said. \"If it didn't hurt it wouldn't be effective. It has to hurt enough so that the student wants to avoid showing that behaviour again.\" As one can plainly see, he is a very sensitive and sensible individual.  I wonder how he would like to be  hooked up to the device he  routinely uses on children, and give them the control over whether to shock him or not.  I'm sure he wouldn't suffer any side effects.  People all over the world would consider this torture if prisoners at Guantanamo Bay were subjected to this.  Why is it considered \"treatment\" when used on the developmentally disabled? Fortunately the majority of Aussies interviewed for the article seem to be a sensible lot, and agree that such \"treatment\" is totally unsuitable and unjustified: Queensland mum, Joy, who struggles to cope with her autistic son Jayden, thought she would try the new device for herself. \"Before trying this I was sitting on the fence and I wasn't sure if I was for or against it.\" \"After feeling the intensity of this, I'm totally opposed to the whole thing,\" she said.  Even in cases where there has been a history of repeated violent behavior, an Aussie dad could see that torture was not the answer: Sydney dad, Jim, has had his teeth broken three times by daughter Molly and he was also willing to try this new technique. His six-year-old daughter has a history of being violent and he was prepared to be open minded bout this treatment. \"It might seem cruel (the eclectic shock) but in the times where she's smashing her head against the concrete or doing physical harm, that's got to outweigh ( the pain) side of it,\" he said. \"Ow that hurt\u2026it\u2019s painful, very painful,\" said Jim, after we've given him a shock using Dr Israel's system. Jim thinks the therapy would just torture Molly who would be in tears after being subjected to the controversial shock treatment. The article concludes by interviewing an Australian autism expert, Dr. Jackie Roberts, who felt the shock treatments would only make things worse: \"Children with autism in particular have a very high level of fear and anxiety, and punishing them actually increases that fear,\" said Dr Roberts. \"\u2026it's likely to make the behaviours worse,\" she said. \"We do know that punishment has a short-term effect.\" It would be a very sad world where no one recognized this \"treatment\" for the torture it is.  I'm heartened to hear the voices of reason by our friends down under, and I can only hope that they don't think that all of us up here are as nuts as Dr. Israel.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RsZYUbc_KpI/AAAAAAAAANo/xJgkav_xaGU/s1600-h/taser-J-Star.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/jstar/427440605/", "http://www.judgerc.org/", "http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=286293"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/08/shocking-american-export.html", "title": "\nShocking American Export\n"},
{"date": "Monday, August 6, 2007", "body": "\nSo we're on vacation (holiday) this week, and today found us driving from Limon, Colorado to Durango, Colorado.  Much of the trip is a rising and falling two lane highway thru the high plains of rural Colorado.  As the road rose and fell, it became difficult to receive any radio stations for more than 5-7 miles.  I cycled the car radio from Jimmy Buffet to Spanish folk songs to preachers to (I kid you not) Spanish rap music (I was heretofore unaware of the genre). Finally we reached a place where there was only one public radio station that had any reception.  Fortunately, we were able to receive this station for about an hour.  The show \"Speaking of Faith\" was on, which is often fairly interesting, as it has in depth discussions of a wide variety of topics of both general and religious interest.  Today the show was a look at a L'Arche community in Clinton, Iowa. I had never heard of L'Arche before today.  After hearing of it today, I must admit it sounds intriguing. I have an instant and intense revulsion to anything that smacks of institutionalizing individuals.  And even \"group homes\" have a somewhat patronizing feel to me.  But in listening to the discussion today, I have to admit that at least the people interviewed at L'Arche are talking the talk, and may be walking the walk as well. The  L'Arche movement  was started by philosopher  Jean Vanier  in 1964, when Vanier invited two men with mental handicaps to live with him in a home in  Trosly-Breuil, France.  From this humble beginning, the movement has spread to include 120 communities worldwide, with 16 being located in the US. The members of each community that have mental handicaps are referred to as \"core members\", while those that live with them are referred to simply as \"assistants\".  Some communities are based in Catholicism (as the original community was), some are Christian of mixed denomination, and others are multi-religious.  The communities are based on four principles: The recognition of the unique value of persons with a developmental disability to reveal that human suffering and joy can lead to growth, healing and unity. When their gift is received, individual, social and ecclesial change occurs; Life sharing where persons with a mental disability and those who assist them live, work and pray together, creating a home; Relationships of mutuality in which people give and receive love; Christian community that welcomes people from all faiths, based on the Gospel and dependent upon the Spirit of God where faithful relationships, forgiveness and celebration reveal God's personal presence and love. The website and the above principles don't do justice to what I listened to.  The people that were interviewed that were assistants at the Iowa L'Arche community provided many examples of how the people that they lived and worked with became their friends and of how they recognized that their communities were not a solution for society, but rather a signal to society that they needed to find a way to respect all of those in our midst and find ways to integrate them into society. Some also reflected on how all of us in society are handicapped in some way, and of  how we need to value each and every person in society, and recognize what they can contribute.  Of perhaps greater import, the people interviewed recognized that not everything was worked out in their communities, problems existed, and that everyone in the community needed to work together to solve them. The program is available for listening or downloading online  here .  Krista Tippet, the radio journalist, really did an excellent job with this.  Her treatment is far superior to what I write here today.   Although I hope and expect that my son will be able to live either independently or semi-independently, it is possible that this will not be feasible.  If he were to choose to live in some type of communal arrangement, I can think of far worse places than a L'Arche community for him to live in.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.larcheusa.org/", "http://www.larcheusa.org/jeanvanier.html", "http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/larche/kristasjournal.shtml"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/08/larche-interesting-concept-in-community.html", "title": "\nL'Arche-An Interesting concept in community\n"},

When he builds something, you can tell that he always starts with a vision in his head of what the thing will look like when it is finished.  Once he starts, he's usually \"in the zone\".  There's little time for chit chat, though sometimes he likes to describe what particular bits are for while he's in the construction process.  He cuts and folds paper, strings strings all around, and continues until he's finished.  Watching him build is like watching a sculptor release an image from a block of stone. Buddy Boy has also confirmed for me multiple times that, like Temple Grandin, he \"thinks in pictures\".  Neither I nor Liz have ever mentioned the concept to him, but on multiple times he has referred to the \"pictures in his head\".  It's not a photographic memory, though, as the pictures aren't always 100% accurate.  On one occasion he was trying to argue that he had done something that I definitely knew he had not.  He said something like \"My mind is like a tape recorder.  If you could just hit the rewind button you could see the picture of me doing it and know that I'm right.\" I'm waiting to see what the \"time machine\" will look like.

{"date": "Sunday, July 15, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit- Claudecf's photos Some rights reserved.  See  here . Okay, so I've been tagged for my first meme ever, and by two people, no less.  First  Joey's Mom  tagged me for this, then before I got around to responding  Kristina  also tagged me.  I hope that means I don't have to reveal 16 things about myself. To start off, here are the rules: 1. Let others know who tagged you. 2. Players start with 8 random facts about themselves. 3. Those who are tagged should post these rules and their 8 random facts. 4. Players should tag 8 other people and notify them they have been tagged. Okay, so I already said who tagged me.  So on to the eight things... 1) One of the first paying jobs I had was to pass out fliers to the neighborhood for a local alderman (city official).  This was when I was about 10 or 11 years old.  One day the guy just disappears off the face of the map.  There was much speculation that he got on the wrong side of some shady characters he did business with, and he ended up \"swimming with the fishes\".  I harbored an irrational fear for months that as an \"associate\" of his, I was next.  On the one hand, I knew it sounded really illogical, so I didn't tell anyone (as a matter of fact, I don't think I've ever told anyone this).  But on the other hand, I was always looking over my shoulder.  2) I love to drive.  I can remember being about 8 years old, and watching my father intensely while he drove.  I was able to drive a stick shift the first time I got behind the wheel like I'd been doing it for months.  Like most kids, I couldn't wait to get my license when I was 16.  My mom told me I'd get tired of driving, once the novelty wore off.  I never have.  I drove a Chicago cab for a few years, and have also been a truck driver and tractor operator for a landscaper.  If I didn't have a wife and family and the doctor thing going on, I could be happy as an over the road trucker. 3) Ethnically, I'm 100% Polish.  Three out of my four grandparents came thru Ellis Island.  The fourth one was born here (in the US) shortly after her parents came thru Ellis Island.  A lot of who I am can be traced to how this influenced me, though the only Polish language I understand is a couple of swear words.  The whole work hard, get a good education, be a good American citizen, there is no free lunch, we are lucky to be here was drummed into me over and over.  A lot of it stuck. 4) I used to be a musician.  A violinist, to be exact (with some piano, guitar, and drums thrown in).  I haven't played in over 25 years, but my violin sits waiting for me on a shelf in my closet.  I keep meaning to get back to it, but never seem to have the time.  I think if I do pick it up again, once I get my feet wet back in the classics again, I'd like to do some bluegrass. 5) I've been held up at gunpoint.  Twice.  I was 19 the first time, and a new cab driver.  Totally scared out of my wits.  The second time was a couple of years later (also as a cabdriver), but it was almost like a business transaction-\"I've got a gun, you've got money.  Give me the money, and I'll go away.\"  I was more afraid for my life several years later when I was jumped by three guys in front of my apartment in Philadelphia while in medical school (We didn't live in a very good neighborhood).  I was OK physically after that attack, but couldn't sleep well for a few weeks. 6) One of my dreams growing up was to be the next Jacques Cousteau.  I always thought he was one cool dude with one of the greatest jobs in the world.  I started to look into Oceanography as a career for college, but ended up staying in the landlocked midwest and majoring in biology at a local college because of a girl I was going out with.  I figured I could always transfer to somewhere on the coast after two years if I really wanted to do it.  The girlfriend was quickly gone, I never got around to transferring, and medical stuff caught my eye.  The rest is history.  I did take up scuba diving, but haven't done it in the last 10 years or so.  I'd like to dive the barrier reef some day. 7) One of my work study jobs in undergrad was to work in the college's early child development center (fancy name for daycare).  I worked there 2 years, and was made the assistant director my senior year in undergrad.  I liked it so much I ended  up getting a minor in psychology, and almost went to grad school for early childhood education.  Then I discovered that  after  doing two more years of school, I would make  less  than I could make with my undergrad biology degree.  That just didn't seem right.  I did remember all the words to \"The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round\" and many other songs more than 20 years later, though, when I finally became a parent. 8) The first patient that I had die on me in medical school died of AIDS.  It was the late 80's, and there wasn't much that we could do for her.  I spent a lot of time at her bedside talking to her, and to her husband.  When she died, her husband gave me a little felt heart that he said belonged to his wife.  He said that she wanted me to have it.  I carried that heart in my wallet all thru my training years.  So that's it.  Most of the people that I would tag have already been tagged, so I'll get around to identifying eight other people, one of these days...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RpmUqVMEK8I/AAAAAAAAANQ/P4fmLfH84W8/s1600-h/eight.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/bip/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/deed.en-us", "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/", "http://autismvox.com/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/07/my-random-eight-things.html", "title": "\nMy Random Eight Things\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 1, 2007", "body": "\nFor a variety of reasons, I've neglected this blog for a the last 11 days. I've been avidly following Autism Diva's excellent postings  (like this one)  on the autism omnibus hearings in federal court, as well as reading many truly excellent posts on a lot of other blogs. I've rejoiced that Bev's rapier satirical wit (and consummate graphical skills) over at  Asperger Square 8  are getting the recognition they deserve, as one of her illustrations got picked up in an  Arthur Allen article  in Slate. And I've felt down as yet more reports of  abuse  and  murder  of the disabled continue to come in. I'm also a teaching physician, and the year for our residents ends this week, and another year starts next week. I've been busy finishing things up the last couple weeks, and I'll be especially busy the next 6-8 weeks, as I help to get the new residents settled in. But before I go into \"occasional posting\" mode, I'd like to relate what happened over the last couple of weeks when I took the kids fishing. The local park district had a \"family fishing day\" at one of the local parks. They stocked the ponds ahead of time, and it sounded like a nice way to spend the day. So I took the two kids out, and we had a good time (mostly). Like a good dad, I was in charge of baiting the hooks (with worms), untangling lines, and assisting with casting (as well as keeping the kids out of everyone else's area). I had taken the kids out twice last year, without any luck, as well as once earlier this year, which was unsuccessful. But the kids wanted to go (and I love to fish, though I don't get much chance lately), and I thought we would have a good time. Sweet Pea took right to it this time, and hauled in 7 fish. Buddy Boy didn't catch any. After Sweet Pea had caught 4, I had them change spots and change poles, but it was no use. Sweet Pea continued to haul them in. It wouldn't have been so bad, except that with her competitive nature she just had to lord it over Buddy Boy. This caused Buddy Boy to lose interest in fishing, so I let him go dig some holes in the dirt with a stick (one of his favorite activities), while I got our stuff together. Then we all headed over to the playground equipment, which made them both happy. The following week (last week) Sweet Pea had started day camp, but Buddy Boy still had not, so I took him fishing again with me when I had a day off. This time he was successful, and caught 4 fish. We probably caught the same fish he's holding in the picture four times, but that was fine with him and me. We also spent some time playing at the edge of a fountain, and on some of the playground equipment. It was a good day. When we picked Sweet Pea up from camp that day Buddy Boy told her about catching fish. I expected her to a) get upset that we went without her, and b) emphasize that her fish were bigger and she caught more. To my surprise (and delight) she did neither. Instead, what she said when she heard was \"Way to go, Buddy Boy! That's great!\". I couldn't believe my ears. As soon as I could catch my breath, I made sure to praise her for being such a good sister by celebrating Buddy Boy's catch. Raising kids is never boring. And even though it can be challenging at times, the good surprises that happen make it all great. I'll continue hanging out in the blogoshere, but probably won't post quite so much for the next couple months. But I'll be thinking about all of you.

{"date": "Wednesday, June 20, 2007", "body": "\n While driving in to work today I heard a story on the radio regarding a  special needs children's orphanage  in Iraq that was recently raided.  According to the story, a routine military patrol in Baghdad happened to look over a wall, and saw the following: ...Inside the building, a government-run orphanage for special needs children, the soldiers found emaciated little bodies tied to the cribs, CBS News reports exclusively. They had been kept this way for more than a month, according to the soldiers called in to rescue the dying boys. ... ...\"The kids were tied up, naked, covered in their own waste \u2014 feces \u2014 and there were three people that were cooking themselves food, but nothing for the kids,\" Lt. Stephen Duperre said. ... The tone of the article was one of shock and dismay.  As if, in a country where its former leader would use nerve gas to kill his own citizens for the crime of being from a different tribe than he, we should be surprised that special needs kids are abused and left to die. But, my overarching reaction was something more akin to \"Hey, where've you been, CBS?  You don't have to go to Iraq to see abuse of those who are in institutions.\"  Perhaps you should look a little bit closer to home.  For starters, you could look at how  UNICEF  has cataloged systemic abuse of children in institutions all across the world, including in the West.  One could also go to  this web site  to see stories from former patients in mental institutions in the US.  Another place closer to home would be to read  Amanda Baggs' list  of ways institutionalized people are abused in institutions.  Finally, abuse of autistics both in and out of institutions is cataloged by Joel Smith  here . I guess the bottom line is while I think people  should  be outraged at the treatment that these children were/weren't receiving, I think that CBS missed an opportunity (responsibility?) to also shed a little light on a lot of abuse that happens a lot closer to home, here in the US.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Rngc-qcGzrI/AAAAAAAAAMo/A-rUxwpCOo8/s1600-h/lg.jpg", "http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/topstories_story_169185222.html", "http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/media_27185.html", "http://www.mindfreedom.org/personal-stories", "http://amanda.autistics.org/intangible.html", "http://community.livejournal.com/autistic_abuse/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/06/selective-outrage.html", "title": "\nSelective Outrage\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, June 14, 2007", "body": "\n I am no fan of the rapidly rising rate of the use of closed circuit television cameras (CCTV cams) in public places for surveillance purposes.  I agree with  the ACLU  that they are intrusive and don't generally accomplish what we are told that they will.  I think that they contribute to the formation of a \"nanny state\" where those in power can abuse information gleaned from them.  Not that I personally do any dastardly deeds in public, but I just don't want to be watched whenever I am walking around in public. Great Britain has been a leader in installing CCTV cams in public places.  Although still a bit controversial, for the most part citizens across the pond in the UK have  embraced the concept  of having public spaces actively surveilled by cameras.  Here in the US, what once was the province of only a few places (such as at bank teller stations) has now mushroomed not only in private establishments, but also in public places.  This is probably due to many factors.  One, certainly, is the decreasing cost of such video equipment.  For about $500, one can get a camera and software to record fairly good quality video on your computer while you're away.  Another reason is increased public uneasiness following the 9/11 attacks in 2001.  Video surveillance is sold to the public as a preventive measure against such attacks occurring again.  Yet another reason is the role that video surveillance cameras have played in assisting in solving crime.  Although there is not good data to back it up, there are an increasing number of abducted or attacked teens (and others) where video turns up on the news shows within 24 hours.  Whether or not the video helps solve the crime, a voyeuristic public wants to see those same frames of video over and over and over again. But there's another side of video cameras that's not altogether bad at all.  The Rodney King case in California would not have gotten the press it did without the compelling  video  of King being beaten in the streets by the LA police.  The rise of cameras being integrated into cell phones has also allowed us an insight into events that we might not have had otherwise.   Michael Richards'  outrageous tirade at a comedy club might have been a story buried in the paper for one day, but for the video that was caught on a cell phone which allowed Richards to hang himself with his own words. Closer to the theme of this post, cell phone videos have shown  teachers behaving badly , when they didn't know they were being recorded. But what does any of this have to do with schools (and special ed classrooms in particular)?  A lot, I think.  I am sure that I in the minority opinion (especially if one surveyed teachers), but I think it would be an excellent idea to install passive video surveillance in all school classrooms and other areas where students gathered (\"quiet rooms\", resource rooms, gymnasiums, playgrounds, lunchrooms, etc.).  By passive video surveillance, I mean that the video would be continuously recorded onto tape or hard drive, and be available for retrieval for a fixed period of time (say, 60-90 days).  After that time it would be erased.  Now, like the ACLU, I believe that such recordings open up the possibility for abuse, so I would have strict rules for how they could be used.   First of all, no one would view the tapes unless there was an \"incident\" that had occurred.  Anytime any student got \"written up\" for a disciplinary infraction, or anytime anyone (police, parents, students, teachers) made any allegations of possible wrongdoings, a neutral investigator would be appointed (someone outside of the school) and all of the recorded material from that school for the day in question would be stored until the incident could be settled.  The recordings would be availabe for all interested parties to watch.  It would be the law that this was legal (so that the schools couldn't hide behind some false claim of privacy of other students).   Why do I think this is a good idea?  Well, read Kristina Chew's  blog entry  from today, where 4 educators in a New York school are being charged with multiple cases of abusing disabled children.  In a different context, Amanda Baggs has  described  what it's like to be institutionalized in what is considered a \"good\" situation. Having such a system in place (passive surveillance kept confidential unless there was a dispute) would serve a number of different purposes.  First of all, it would go a long way towards levelling the playing field in what is always a very unequal power relationship.  School teachers and administrators wield a considerable amount of control and power over their students, and having a neutral observer in the classroom would be essential in many cases of showing what really occurred in a given situation.  Secondly, when there is a pattern of neglect and not addressing educational goals that have been laid out and agreed to (in an IEP), video can be reviewed to see if this is actually the case or not. Many (especially teachers) will recoil at this suggestion.  But it's not as if this would be the first place where recordings of events when someone was working would take place.  As I stated, in businesses all over, the employees as well as the customers are under surveillance.  Police officers have become accustomed to having video cameras in their cars recording routine (and non-routine) traffic stops and car chases.  Many officers have been glad to have these recordings to back their side of the story up when they have been accused.  Emergency rooms have had such surveillance, and so have some operating rooms (theatres).  There would certainly be a psychological period of adjustment on the part of teachers, but with the safeguards I have included, I do not think that this would be too great. And we might just be able to weed out several bad apples in the process.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RnClg6cGzpI/AAAAAAAAAMY/WUCgurPEm7E/s1600-h/surveillance-video.jpg", "http://www.aclu.org/privacy/spying/14863res20020225.html", "http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0206/p07s02-woeu.html", "http://www.multishow.com.ar/rodneyking/", "http://www.tmz.com/2006/11/20/kramers-racist-tirade-caught-on-tape/", "http://www.buzzhumor.com/videos/14058/Teacher_Flips_Out_Real_Bad", "http://www.autismvox.com/ny-educators-plead-not-guilty/", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=223"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/06/eye-on-school-safety.html", "title": "\nAn Eye on School Safety\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 16, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit-  Shaun.numb So, Liz was walking thru the local mall the other day, and they passed the central fountain (which has always been a big hit with Buddy Boy since he was at least 6 months old-even after sitting there watching it for 30 minutes he would scream when we left it).  On this day the fountain was spewing pink water (which was just fine with Sweet Pea, as she  loves  anything pink). The pink water was a marketing thing for the  Susan G. Komen  race for the cure event that is coming to our town soon.  In explaining the event to Buddy Boy, she explained that everyone doesn't always run, and that many walk, much like the  \"Autism Walk\"  that we have taken part in in the past.  Well Buddy Boy put together the notions of \"curing breast cancer\" and \"autism walk\" together in his brain right away, and even though Liz never said anything about curing autism, he said, \"I don't want to be cured.  I'm not sick.\" He then seemed to infer that the Autism Walk money might be used to \"cure\" autism, because he stated, \"If we go on the Autism Walk again, we can just take their money.  I am not sick.\" Later, when Liz was in the car with the kids, listening to the same National Public Radio (NPR) story on autism that  Autism Diva  was, one of the participants referred to autism as a disease.  Immediately Buddy Boy piped up from the back seat, \"It's not a disease!\" Liz agreed, saying that autism is actually a disorder, to which Buddy Boy responded, \"It's not a disorder, either!  Autism makes me special!\" To which Liz could only agree. Now I know that what a 7 year old puts forth as his opinion cannot be reliably said to be his opinion alone.  Certainly a lot of what he says are just things he's heard.  But while we certainly try to keep a positive spin on autism, we don't usually discuss autism  politics or controversies in front of him (we're much more focused on discussing things like the proper channeling of aggression).  So when I heard this I was glad that Buddy Boy had what I considered a very healthy view of things, and seemed to be integrating his own feelings on the subject with things he's heard from us and others.  On top of that, all I can say is, \"That's my boy!\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RnNjt6cGzqI/AAAAAAAAAMg/Jp9m1_wtSoE/s1600-h/argument.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/shaun_morrison/63959595/", "http://cms.komen.org/komen/index.htm", "http://www.walknowforautism.org/site/c.grKPI2PCImE/b.2485123/k.BD69/Home.htm", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2007/06/vaccines-on-trial-npr.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/06/out-of-mouths-of-babes.html", "title": "\nOut of the Mouths of Babes...\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 9, 2007", "body": "\n In the world of autism, we often look to a small army of people with titles and training for assistance-SLP's, PT's, OT's, social workers, psychiatrists, teachers, autism specialists, aides, etc.  All of these people are  great, and I'm glad that they exist.  They all have helped Buddy Boy at one time or another. But something that happened today reminded me of a whole other group of people that are often overlooked, but no less important.  Peers.  Sometimes just as much assistance (if not more) is provided by occasional individuals with no training, no title, and no pay. We had a great day today.  I was off work.  The whole family went to a local cave where noted outlaw Jesse James once holed up.  The kids loved walking thru the cave and looking at the stalagtites, stalagmites, and the underground river (although Sweet Pea complained the 40 minutes or so tour was \"too long\").  Both kids got a souvenir (Sweet Pea got a little unicorn, and Buddy Boy got a flashlight that could project pictures of dinosaurs on the walls).  After going out to lunch we still had some time left, so I dropped Liz off and took the kids to our local park. Who should we run into but Anna, who dedicated readers may remember as the  blond girl  from Kindergarten who befriended Buddy Boy almost two years ago now.  When Buddy Boy was on the fringes and not participating at all, she would approach him and try to talk him into joining the group.  She was low key, patient, and persistent.  When other typical kids in his class were turned off by his either seeming to ignore them or shrieking at them, she continued to interact with him.  And she ended up being one of the better things to happen to Buddy Boy during an otherwise  difficult  year. Buddy Boy never got together with Anna outside of school, and when he went to two different schools this past year during first grade, one of our regrets was the loss of Anna as a friendly face for him to see in school. When we got to the park today Buddy Boy first attempted to climb a crabapple tree that he sometimes likes to climb.  Then he ran over to the playground equipment.  I was assisting Sweet Pea climb the tree (if Buddy Boy does something, she just has to follow suit).  It was then that I noticed the two of them talking.  I thought it was Anna from across the playground, but I had only seen her a couple of times, and none recently.  They were talking at the top of one of the slides, and I heard Buddy Boy shrieking, which he sometimes does when he gets excited.  Usually this is somewhat frightening to most kids, but when this girl didn't run off it confirmed to me that it must have been her. He followed her and they played on a couple of pieces of equipment.  Then Sweet Pea insisted that she wanted to go over and play with them.  Sweet Pea went over and quickly convinced them to play \"Troll\".  Playing \"Troll\" at the playground involves yours truly being the troll who chases the other players and tries to catch and eat them.  The troll chases but usually doesn't catch them, except maybe to tag them.  Twenty minutes of this left me fairly worn out, but of course the kids could have gone on all afternoon.  The kids continued to play a little more after that, then we had to get going.   It was great that Anna remembered Buddy Boy, and even better that she still accepted him as he was.  There was a part of me that was afraid that she would have \"matured\" and been socialized in the last year and a half to reject those who are out of the ordinary.  I'm not sure what it was that made her reach out to Buddy Boy when they were in school together, but I'm really happy she did.  Sometimes I think it's the non-structured, spontaneous interactions that help Buddy Boy the most.   Here's hoping this is the start of a great Summer. ---------------------------------------------- Random funny thing overheard today (during minor spat between Buddy Boy and Sweet Pea): \"You're lucky that I'm not the kind of brother that would throw his sister into an active volcano that was still filling up with magma.\" \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RmpD96cGzoI/AAAAAAAAAMM/5UAbOtbEadE/s1600-h/Stacy+Park+06-08-07.JPG"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/06/in-praise-of-peers.html", "title": "\nIn Praise of Peers\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 2, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit-  Isaac Mao For followers of the blogs on the  Autism Hub , one would have to have been asleep over the last several days to have missed it's mini identity crisis.   Larry Arnold  touched things off with his Animal Farm posting, in which he made the good point that autism advocacy should be led by autistics (although I am hard pressed to see where anyone on the Hub has suggested otherwise).  He also seemed to want to rail against non-autistic adults of autistic children, seemingly for the twin crimes of drawing attention away from autistic adults, as well as hijacking the neurodiversity movement. My first reaction was \"What?\", while my next reaction was more like, \"WTF?\"  I mean, I'm accustomed to  getting attacked  for offending believers in \"cures\" for autism, but was initially blindsided by reading this in a space I consider \"friendly\" territory.  But I figured that this was just a passing thing, and as I have followed Arnold's blog for some time, and have gained much from reading his insights, didn't think too much about it. Then this mini crisis continued when Larry posted  another time , and Kevin Leitch, having the integrity of the hub questioned, did some  public soul searching  on his blog. I've held off on commenting on any of these postings, though I started a few times and then stopped.  On the one hand Larry seems to have raised a few legitimate points, namely that autistics should be the ones setting the agenda for what they think is necessary, and that autistics should be in positions of power in organizations that purport to represent them.   On the other hand, I felt a little like Larry opened the door to the family room, threw in a grenade, then quickly exited.  I don't mind people forcefully arguing their views, even when it makes me uncomfortable.  But I felt that when Larry started making accusations regarding all the bad things parents of autistics on the Hub had been doing, but then not backing it up with specifics, that that was rather unfair.  How was one supposed to respond?  I'm sorry for all the bad things I've done, even though I don't really know that I'm part of the evil cabal you're referring to? Larry seemed to repeat a couple times that more attention was being paid not only to issues he felt irrelevant (mercury poisoning theory), but also people he felt irrelevant (non-autistic parents).  I'm not sure how this was determined (response counts, number of posts, some web traffic meter?).   So I started thinking.  Well, what's the solution to this?  Should Kevin limit the number or ratio of non-autistics he lets on the Hub?  Should some of us get the hook for not being relevant enough?  Do I, as a non-autistic, have to submit all of my posts to the central committee for clearance before I hit the publish button? After thinking about this for a couple of days, here is what I think. I don't know why Larry thinks that he and other autistics aren't payed attention to enough on the Hub.  I read every post that every person puts up there.  I don't comment as much on posts made by autistic persons, but I think that has been because there is a sense inside of me of a)not wanting, as a non-autistic, to hijack their post, and b)being less likely to question what they say about being autistic, because, hey, they're autistic and I'm not, so if they say something is a certain way, then it probably is. As for my own blog, I freely admit that I'm not the greatest writer in the world.  Decades of scientific education tend to beat creative writing skills out of you.  But a long time ago I fancied myself a bit of a writer, and I'm trying to revive that part of myself.  I have yet to find a consistent voice that runs thru all of my posts.  I am a non-autistic parent of an autistic child.  I don't think I should have to apologize for that.  I have never tried to represent myself as a leader of anything autistic, and any advocacy I have done is primarily on the behalf of my son, as well as trying to create better understanding in the world that he will inhabit. My writing may be spotty at times, and my topics may occasionally not be acceptable to all.  But I don't have the time to worry about trying to censor myself so that I can get by the central committee censors.  So if that is what is going to happen on the Hub, then I'm afraid that Kevin is going to give me the axe. I've really enjoyed being on the Hub.  I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I got the e-mail that I was being included.  It was also nice to see my web stats go up.  There are a lot of nice people that I've cyber-met thru the Hub, and I've considered it one of the prime sources of reliable information regarding autism on the web.  Sure, some people (both autistic as well as not) on the Hub blog about things that are non-autism related at times.  But I've enjoyed the humor, the pathos,  the scholarship, and even the minor disagreements that have occurred.  I'm not quite sure how I feel at the moment, but do know that I will continue blogging, whether I am considered a 'good parent' that is allowed to remain on the Hub, or not. It seems just a bit ironic, that recently many were making fun of those on the EoH group for taking to task their own members who didn't have kids that were severely affected enough.  Now we seem to have those on the Hub who would seem to be doing a similar thing, lashing out at those on the Hub who weren't toeing the line as they saw it enough. I don't mind when someone breaks some eggs, but I do mind when the eggs seem to be blindly thrown at other's houses, and not used to make an omelette.  I'm a bit player on the Hub, and easily dismissed.  But I think that people like Kevin and Estee have been done a severe disservice, and deserve better.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RmL99n9V8oI/AAAAAAAAAL8/pEaRvsQRz1w/s1600-h/censorship.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/isaacmao/9753846/", "http://autism-hub.co.uk/", "http://autism-hub.co.uk/", "http://laurentius-rex.blogspot.com/2007/06/you-cant-make-omelette-without-breaking.html", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/06/censorship.html", "title": "\nCensorship?\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 30, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit- Steve Brandon Kristina Chew referred on  her blog    to  an article  today about an autistic individual who died while being subdued by police.  According to the article: ...Mitchell died in a hospital last July following a struggle with deputies at his Perris home. Deputies responded to the residence after his mother called 911 saying she needed authorities to pick up her son. ... The article was prompted by the mother filing a wrongful death lawsuit against the police.  As might be expected, there are two different versions of what caused the incident: ...Sheriff's officials contend Mitchell died from autism-induced \"excited delirium syndrome,\" a condition that leads to sudden cardiac arrest. ... ...\"That's what they always say,\" attorney Carl Douglas said.  Douglas believes Mitchell died of positional asphyxiation after several officers piled on top of him. ... Before I go any further, let me state for the record that I am generally supportive of law enforcement.  I have expressed  concerns  about their level of training and how police interact with autistics, but I have also given  praise  when I felt they deserved it.  They have a tough job, and have to make some tough decisions in rapid succession.  They also aren't always trained as well as they should be to deal with \"special case\" situations, such as dealing with autistics. After seeing the post on Kristina's blog today and reading the article, I just had to make some comments. As a physician, I had never heard the term \"Excited Delirium Syndrome\" until I heard it bandied about as a defense when subjects had died in police/emergency workers custody shortly after being forcibly subdued by them.  And I had never heard autism ever mentioned as something that might induce such a \"syndrome\".  Personally, I don't think it exists as a separate syndrome. Excited delirium syndrome has been used when a person dies in custody after being forcibly subdued.  Typically the person that died was also under the influence of illegal drugs such as PCP, cocaine, and methamphetamine.  All of these drugs can put a stress on your heart before, during, and after a forcible struggle with the police.  While I do understand that  sometimes  force is required to subdue violent individuals, I believe that there is inadequate recognition of the possible negative outcomes that can result from forcibly subduing someone, which results to force being reverted to too often, and more importantly, improper after care once force has been applied. Here is what I think happens in a \"typical\" death from \"Excited Delirium Syndrome\": 1) Police are summoned to take into custody a violent or potentially violent person.  Being the police, they are expected to actively take action to deal with someone, especially if they are actively violent at the time.  Sometimes I think that they take physical action too quickly when the person they are dealing with is  not  actively violent.  This may be due to what we term \"production pressure\" in medicine (the push to get things done so you can move on to other important things), or it may be due to inadequate training.  In a typical scenario, once police arrive they typically want to control the situation as quickly as possible.  Lack of control means too many variables, and too many variables means too many chances for someone to get hurt.  So they rapidly progress thru their \"use of force continuum\" until they get control of the situation.  This continuum differs a little from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but typically looks something like this (from  Wikipedia ):     1. Presence    2. Verbalization    3. Empty hand control    4. Intermediate weapons (e.g., chemical, electronic or impact weapons)    5. Deadly Force (any force likely to cause permanent injury or death) What I believe typically happens is that the officer, thru physical presence (man standing confidently in uniform with gun) and verbalization (may start with asking for compliance, rapidly progressing to orders of compliance-\"come here, turn around, get down on your knees, etc.)tries to get compliance from the subject.  Not getting the desired result, I think most officers resort to 2) Hands on techniques.  Usually these start innocently enough as a gentle laying of their arm on the suspects arm or shoulder to get them to comply or come along, but then progresses to joint locks, arm bars, hair pulls, and other techniques to coerce compliance.  I think it is at this point that things start escalating quickly.  The police officer involved certainly has a lot of endogenous epinephrine (adrenaline) flowing in his veins, making it more difficult for him/her to judge how much force they are applying and for how long.  The subject, especially if they have a hard time understanding what is happening (either because of drug/alcohol intoxication, language difficulties or cognitive disabilities) also has gone into a  \"fight or flight response\"  and starts fighting for their life.  The police officer(s) now involved sense what is a very disorganized scene and rapidly escalate their responses to gain control.  This may involve choke holds (which have been banned from many departments) or may involve multiple people striking the subject and/or \"piling on\" them to subdue them.  This leads to what is a critical juncture, namely 3) Loss of ability to breathe for the subject.  If a person has not been fighting forcefully up to this point, then they certainly will now.  I've seen 80 year old sweet grandmothers become markedly violent when they can't breathe.  It's a primal instinct.  We can only go 4 minutes at rest without breathing.  This time is markedly shortened when we are also expending maximum energy in trying to regain our airway.  Officers may or may not recognize that they have compromised a person's airway at this point.  I suspect that they are focused on subduing the person, not getting hurt, and not letting anyone else get hurt.   Not being able to breathe, while rapidly using up all your oxygen will predictably lead to unconsciousness.  There will be a short period of time where recognizing the person is unconscious, rapidly acting to get everyone off them and open their airway, and administering mouth to mouth resuscitation will revive them.  This period will be fairly short in length, though, and probably missed, leading then to 4) Cardiac arrest.  At this point the person has quit struggling and the officers have spent time applying handcuffs to their wrists (and possibly restraining ankles also) with the person in the face down position.  This makes it difficult for them to recognize that the person has indeed arrested, and failure to quickly resuscitate the person leads to 5) Certain death. In analyzing the above scenario, there are a few critical points where decisions made can end up snowballing into possibly catastrophic consequences.  The first point is the initial laying on of hands by police.  If a person is actively trying to hurt another, then the police's hands are tied.  But if they are not hurting anyone else, then I think that staying verbal longer can avoid some negative outcomes.  The gentle laying of your hand on someone's arm can be soothing to many, but it can lead to atypical reactions in some populations (like autistics).  Most people with autistics in their immediate family know that touching them when they are excited is not usually a good thing.  At the least they involuntarily pull away, at worst they may lash out (usually indiscriminately).  So even though it may take longer (sometimes a  lot  longer) to talk someone down, if it resolves the situation then it's a good thing. The second critical point in the above scenario is in recognizing that the person's airway has been compromised.  This is admittedly very tough in what has now become a fluid violent situation, but I think that if there is increased awareness of this possibility that there will be increased recognition and proper treatment when it happens.  I also think that the police might want to borrow something from medicine.  Whenever we run a \"code\" on a person, if possible we designate a person the team leader, and that person does not get involved with manual tasks such as chest compressions, starting IV lines, giving drugs, etc.  Their main role is to make decisions and constantly reevaluate the entire situation.  The senior police officer on the scene has to try (if possible) to not become physically involved.  This is admittedly very tough when the situation is not in control, but there is a greater chance of someone recognizing when things are going awry when they are not physically involved in subduing the individual.  If they have to become physically involved in subduing the individual, then they need to rapidly back out of that role as soon as possible. The next critical step is one that I do not believe occurs at present.  That is, immediately after a subject stops moving in such a situation, someone needs to verify that the person is breathing.  Often I suspect that the police, having gone thru their own \"fight or flight\" response, are very jittery and coming down from this at this time, feeling a bit more relaxed as the suspect is restrained.  But this is a critical point in the confrontation, when seconds lost can have disastrous consequences for the subject.  While there may be a feeling of \"they got what they deserve\" for fighting back at the time, as police can also be injured in these events, I don't think that upon calm reflection any police officer would think that any person \"deserved\" immediate death on the street for resisting arrest.  Increased recognition of loss of airway commonly occurring in these situations needs to be stressed in training of officers, as well as ways to recognize and deal with it to prevent further injury to the subject. In light of the above, and since police officers are not really trained to act as first responders for medical issues, I would think that policy should be changed such that paramedics are on the scene before any person that is not violent is approached with physical measures.  This suggestion will certainly result in a large uproar from those in emergency services.  But I think that in terms of preventing lives lost it may be necessary.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RlyA7BzGp2I/AAAAAAAAALo/g1Io7OJEG4w/s1600-h/police+car+and+ambulance.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/steve-brandon/297001038/", "http://www.autismvox.com/autism-induced-excited-delirium-syndrome/", "http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/05/28/state/n124209D97.DTL", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_force", "http://changingminds.org/explanations/brain/fight_flight.htm"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/05/death-by-suffocation.html", "title": "\nDeath by Suffocation\n"},

Little did I know that questions would come so soon... As you may recall, Sweet Pea has had a fascination with  having a baby  for over a year now. It's not quite an obsession, just something that never seems to be far from the surface. Liz related this story to me the day it happened. A couple of weeks ago Liz was driving Sweet Pea home from pre-school. They were on the way to pick up Buddy Boy from his school. Sweet Pea, ever the little Miss Gabby, was going on about all the kids at school, the birthday party she was going to that weekend, and what she wanted for dinner. All of a sudden she jumps right in with \"When the man puts the seed in the woman, does it hurt?\" Liz reads a lot of science stuff with Buddy Boy. He knows a lot of facts about a lot of stuff. Sweet Pea usually acts as if she's not paying attention, but evidently when they were talking vaguely about sexual reproduction in some animal she was all ears. When Liz related this to me, I was like \"What? Well, what did you say?\" I usually believe in not lying about such things, but 5 years old??? I was hoping she came up with some distraction or vague answer. Failing that, I must admit that I hoped she lied. \"I told her no, it didn't hurt\". \"What?! Have you forgotten that we were raised Catholic? Are you totally unaware of the power of instilling guilt? You should have told her that there was nothing more painful in the whole universe (I was only half joking)! Then what did she say?\" \"That she wanted a hot dog for dinner.\" I am so not ready for any of this yet.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RlkWIhzGp1I/AAAAAAAAALg/tThh5gvo98M/s1600-h/BirdsAndBees.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/camerachick/451070114/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/05/sex-ed.html", "title": "\nSex Ed\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, May 26, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit- shutterblog There's an acquaintance of mine that lives in the Seattle area (I'll call him Ed).  He lived in Asia for several years, then moved back to the states.  His wife and he ended up divorcing, and his two sons lived with him.  They were still pre-teens/early teens, and the divorce was as hard (or harder) on them as it was on him. Ed is a counselor by training and profession, and after the divorce had problems with his own two kids acting out.  He related to me once how every night when they were sleeping he would sit by their bedsides and whisper softly to them.  He would tell them how much he loved them, and talk positively about some aspect of each child each day.  He said there's no way of telling if this ever influenced them, but gradually they all got better. Something about this story struck me, and as I was a new father at the time (we had recently adopted Buddy Boy) I incorporated this into my bedtime routine with him, and later with Sweet Pea. So in addition to reading and singing to the kids, I would whisper things to them.  I would tell them about how great they were, how Liz and I loved them to the moon and back, and about all the wonderful things they would do when they grew up. I don't do this as much with Sweet Pea or Buddy Boy at bedtime anymore, but I have continued this with Buddy Boy in the middle of the night. Buddy Boy, like many kids on the spectrum, has had some problems with toilet training.  His sister pretty much self trained at 3 years old, but with Buddy Boy it's always been a bit of a struggle.  At 7 he's fine during the day, but unless we wake him up to take him to the bathroom during the night he's sure to be wet in the morning.  Even with taking him at night there are still about 30% wet mornings, but at least if he's been taken at night it's confined to his pullups, and doesn't spread to the rest of the bed. When I take him to the bathroom and lead him back to bed he's basically sleepwalking.  If I don't guide him where to go he would probably bump into something.  After taking him back to bed I will usually whisper a few things to him.  I tell him what a great kid he is, and how I'm proud of him because of (something that he did good that day).  I tell him how much fun I have with him, and how happy I am that I'm his father.  I don't make it too long, and whisper very softly, for I don't want to wake him up (especially as we've been having sleep issues).   Usually he just lies there, looking as beautiful and peaceful as he did as a baby.  But sometimes as I'm talking I see a smile come across his lips, and I know that I've penetrated his subconscious on some level. It's one of those pure father and son moments that bind us together.  I think it helps both of us know that no matter how hard things are, we will always have our love for each other.  And that that love makes the two of us together stronger than the sum of what each of us brings to the table. I'm going to miss this when he doesn't need us anymore to assist him in the middle of the night.  I might have to slip into his bedroom just to whisper to him for the heck of it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RleFuxzGp0I/AAAAAAAAALY/8k1aidPdp08/s1600-h/whisper.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/shutterblog/169897987/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/05/child-whisperer.html", "title": "\nThe Child Whisperer\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 23, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit- Aroid Well, this last weekend marked a momentous occasion for Buddy Boy. He went to a birthday party!!!!! I was beginning to think he'd never get invited to one again.  The last time he was invited to a party was over 2 years ago.  When he was 4 he was on the edge of \"the parents just invite whoever is in the class, even if they don't know them\" stage.  He then entered into the \"Buddy Boy's the oddball kid who throws tantrums\" stage of recognition (by peers and parents) and I thought that his days of going to parties (he had only attended a few, with only limited success) were over. But one of his classmates from his regular classroom invited him to a birthday party.  It was a bowling party, which was a good thing.  Bowling used to be something that was definitely sensory overloading.  One of the parties that he had gone to a couple years ago was a bowling party, and although he had wanted to go to it, he had a meltdown that was probably sensory in origin (can you think of a place much more loud and echo-ey?). But last summer he was involved in a summer camp thru Giant Steps, which for  those who don't know is a private school that specializes in autism.  They had tons of field trips, including a weekly trip to a bowling alley.  The long and short of it is that Buddy Boy loved going bowling, to the point of it becoming incorporated into his OCD behaviors.  He perseverated for a long time on acquiring a bowling ball.  He asked my sister, the chemist, if she could make him one.  He googled \"free bowling ball\" on the web and found dozens of bowling ball sites-\"Look dad, I don't think this one costs that much!\" So I was glad that it was a bowling party.  It was something he liked, and it had a structure that he would understand, and foster some limited interaction with the other kids. As it turned out, Liz took him instead of me.  I'm usually the designated escort for both kids to parties, but I was involved with taking down a 40 foot pine tree in the back yard, and was up against having not enough time to finish the job. Liz reported that he did reasonably well.  We had written out and reviewed various things with Buddy Boy ahead of time, which we think helps.  Buddy Boy didn't have any meltdowns, didn't interact much but remained basically socially appropriate, and said he had a good time.  In my mind, a roaring success! I only hope we have the opportunity to do it again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RlOuoRzGpzI/AAAAAAAAALQ/P2Gb_jekwv0/s1600-h/birthday+party.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/selago/21005646/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/05/par-tee.html", "title": "\nPar-tee!\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 15, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit- Blisterman Earlier today Kristina Chew on AutismVox had a great blog about  \u201cRace and Age of Autism Diagnosis\u201d . I started to write a response on her blog, but after I got to 4 paragraphs thought I should just write my response here, rather than totally hijack her blog. I have seen studies that relate how blacks are diagnosed at a later age than whites, and have not been surprised. Because of my unique position (white physician parenting an autistic bi-racial (African American/Caucasian) 7 year old, I have a few things to say on the subject. About the only thing that could have made this article more relevant to me would be throwing adoption into the mix (both our kids are adopted). But even if you\u2019re part of what I perceive to be a mostly white middle class (I think you have to start off rich to be upper middle class and parenting a special needs kid) blogging audience, I invite you to read on, as I think a lot of the issues are similar to the discrimination that autistics in general are subject to. First (and perhaps most importantly) blacks and whites in this country generally don\u2019t talk to one another (not exchange pleasantries at work, but really  talk ). In the absence of a true dialogue, opinions on both sides are mostly informed by stereotypes and the media. In the parlance of autism, blacks and whites just don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d each other. Think about it. If you\u2019re a white American and reading this, you might have to think a while before agreeing with the statement \u201cThe majority of blacks in America have a job, are not on welfare, and don\u2019t live in the ghetto.\u201d You might have to think a bit longer before agreeing with the statement \u201cThe majority of blacks in the ghetto are not criminals\u201d. And you might not realize that just under half (about 47%) of blacks  own their own home . The media in this country (popular media as well as the news) portray average blacks as unemployed criminals playing rap music extremely loudly and having multiple kids with multiple different single women in the ghetto. If you are black, consider this. I was in the locker room at the YMCA the other day (I don\u2019t work out nearly as much as I should) and I overheard a couple of black guys in their late twenties talking. One of them was telling the other about how the main purpose of the electoral college is for whites to disenfranchise blacks. I was like \u201cHuh?\u201d The  electoral college  (for those outside of the US) is to keep smaller rural states from becoming disenfranchised. It was set up when the country was founded (when blacks voting wasn't even a consideration). And if anything, it empowers minority voters in each state, where a minority population can swing all of the electoral college votes of that state. There are many other examples of things that many blacks believe that just aren't so, such as that AIDS is a disease that was purposely introduced into the population by the US government to kill off black citizens. When it comes to cultural differences, there are certainly many. Consider church services. Think of the difference between a fairly staid mainstream Episcopalian service full of white people, vs. the hand clapping, organ and choir singing found in the African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Churches often found in African American (AA) communities. AA culture encompasses a wider range of acceptable exuberance for various times in public (besides being in church). But this does not mean that AA parents cannot recognize when behaviors are abnormal in their children. Now let's move on to how blacks interact with, and view, organized medicine. Blacks have a latent distrust of the medical establishment, stemming at least in part from things like the  Tuskegee syphilis experiment , started in 1932, where 400 black men who had syphilis were studied to see the natural course of the disease. The men were not told they had syphilis. Although there was no treatment for syphilis when the study started, by 1947 there was, and antibiotics were withheld from the men in order to continue the study. The study was only stopped in 1972 when public health officials leaked it's existence to the press. Not medicine's finest hour (to say the least), and little wonder that many in the black community still don't believe what doctors tell them, even if they're trying to help them. Also it's no surprise that many AA's avoid doctors as a general rule. There are a number of factors in the doctor's office that also contribute to poor communication, which leads to delayed diagnosis. First of all, doctors (like all people) relate well to those like themselves. If their patients are middle/upper middle class and white, white physicians are more likely to relate to them on a personal level and take their complaints seriously. When patients are perceived to come from a lower class, than doctors are more likely to assume a  paternalistic role  in dealing with the patient, rather than a cooperative one. And given the general perception of blacks as a whole, unless Bill Cosby walks in as a patient, the fact that the patient is black has him/her perceived to be of an inferior class by the doctor. Because blacks, while employed, are more likely to have jobs that don't include medical insurance they are less likely to have a regular physician that they visit. They are more likely to receive episodic care by different providers on each visit in Emergency Rooms.  Complicating matters, at the present time in disadvantaged minority communities seeking education is seen as selling out, and \"acting white\". After all the hard fought battles for equal education, many in the black community don't seem to value it. This can lead to a delay in seeking help that would lead to increased educational services. Finally, as pointed out by Sarah in response to Kristina's blog, a lower level of educational services being available for disadvantaged kids may provide less incentive for their parents to seek a diagnosis. I am not sure if this is correct. I know that in the city I live, there are fairly comparable services available to all comers. There may be an assumption in the AA community that since general education services are less then special ed services would also be less, but judging from posters on a local listserve, this isn't so. So we have a combination of negative societal perceptions of blacks, poor communication between doctors and patients from different cultural backgrounds, a general distrust of the medical system by the AA community, a perception (and perhaps reality in some cases) of lower level of services being provided once a diagnosis is made, and at times less value placed on education by the AA community combining to make it seem nothing short of miraculous that diagnoses are made at all. The general perception of blacks (especially young black males) as being more likely to be criminal, or at least anti-social, also leads to greater use of diagnoses such as oppositional and defiant disorder (ODD) instead of outbursts being recognized as being part of autism. For our part, Buddy Boy was first given a series of diagnoses (developmentally delayed, sensory integration disorder, ADHD) before he was diagnosed at age 4 with PDD-NOS.  I don't think he necessarily was diagnosed later because of his race.  But I do recognize that since his parents are white (and one of them is a physician) that those factors may have totally negated any affect race may have had on his being delayed in diagnosis. Lastly, I think it's important to recognize such things as the impact of race, since by studying it we may gain some insight into how overt and subtle prejudices can affect how all autistics (as a minority group) are treated.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RkjwHIA1L1I/AAAAAAAAALI/jeDonHKmOc8/s1600-h/checkerboard.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/22052353@N00/469805216/", "http://www.autismvox.com/race-and-age-of-autism-diagnosis/", "http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/hvs/annual04/ann04t20.html", "http://www.uselectionatlas.org/INFORMATION/INFORMATION/electcollege_history.php", "http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2002/jul/tuskegee/", "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1448596"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/05/autism-in-black-and-white.html", "title": "\nAutism in Black and White\n"},

Whether that involves putting aside her own career to stay home, modifying her career path in order to be more accessible at home, or burning the candle at both ends in order to also take care of her children, it's still the moms that generally are in the front lines of child care, especially with special needs kids.   This is not to denigrate all of the great dads out there doing there part, and I'm sure that there are dads that do as much, if not more, than the moms.  But for whatever reason, it's mostly moms that you'll find taking the kids back and forth to school, going to most of the IEP meetings, and co-ordinating care between the various doctors, therapists, and others involved in caring for their child. Moms never doubt that they have the best kids in the world.  And moms instinctively (and at times, ferociously) fight to protect their kids against unfair barriers and advocate tirelessly on their kids behalf in systems that are stacked against them.

But they're still important, so we are still formulating how to go about  effecting change over the next year. The first thing is how Buddy Boy is treated at lunch.  Sometimes he doesn't want to eat lunch.  He takes an ADHD med to help him concentrate at school (it works reasonably well), but one of its side effects is that it decreases his appetite during the day.  Sometimes he's hungry and wants to eat, sometimes he doesn't.  We don't care, as Liz always gets a good breakfast in him, and he eats when he gets home (after his med has worn off). The school, however, has taken to punishing him when he doesn't eat his lunch.  If he doesn't eat his lunch, they won't let him go to recess, which is his next thing after lunch.  Liz has tried explaining this to them, but they still don't get it.  Basically this bothers me on a couple of different fronts.  First, he's our kid, not theirs.  He's of normal height and weight.  There is no medical reason that he needs to eat lunch.  And we've told them its OK if he doesn't.  But they think that their judgement should supercede ours in this matter.  What's up with that?  Secondly, we place a high value on recess.  We think it helps to have physical exercise, opportunities for social stimulation, and just plain time to wind down in the middle of the day.  So withholding recess is (in our minds) withholding a vital part of what we consider therapy and teaching for Buddy Boy. The  next thing is that they don't have anyone walk him from class to class, then \"write him up\" when he doesn't get to where he's going.  I think this is one of those things that comes from assumptions being made because he is very verbal.  This last week he got distracted/interested in something outside while transferring from one room to the next.  So he left the building.  This is the first time he's left the building this year.  This, of course, caused a mini-panic at the school, resulting in 6 people going after him, and Buddy Boy initially running from them before returning to the building.  For this he got written up and spent the rest of the day doing \"independent work\", rather than being taught by teachers. I'm sorry, but easy distractability is part of who Buddy Boy is.  And we think it's necessary for the school to make sure that he gets from one room to another.  I don't think he's being \"bad\" when he takes off, and therefore don't think he should be punished when he does.  Just becuase he's verbal, doesn't mean his internal regulation is up to snuff when compared to his same aged peers in 1st grade.  I think it's something they need to deal with, and not make a discipline issue. Finally (for now) one thing  really  bugs me personally.  It's something that his school did last year, and continues at his school this year.  At every IEP meeting, they ask us what meds Buddy Boy is on.  Like it's any of their business.  Haven't they heard about patient confidentiality?  And what are they doing with that information?  The school nurse needs to know what to give him when.  Beyond that, they have no need to know anything. At this year's meeting they asked us what he was on, and I bit my tongue and let Liz respond.  One of the meds he's on is Guanfacine.  So Liz mentions this, and one of the teachers asks \"Isn't that cough medicine?\"  No, I think. that would be Guaifenesin.  Liz justs says no, Guanfacine is a blood pressure medicine that is sometimes used with autisitics. I'm a doctor.  I practice in a field where knowing drugs is central to what I do.  These people are teachers.  Every time they ask about Buddy Boy's meds I want to say \"Why do want this information?  And what will you do with it?  Can you even interpret it?  Because unless you can tell me the mechanism of action of each drug, how it interacts with other drugs, what its alpha and beta half lives are, and volume of distribution, you have absolutely no right to ask that.  Because any decision you may make because of your limited knowledge may be totally wrong, and deleterious to my son.\" What makes me most upset about the asking about the meds thing is, if they're making like they are knowledgeable about a field that I obviously know they are not, what other things are they equally unknowledgeable about that they think they know?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/05/things-that-bug-me.html", "title": "\nThings that bug me\n"},
{"date": "Friday, May 11, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit-  epc Well, we just had our shortest (and least contentious) IEP meeting ever-one hour, 20 minutes!  Buddy Boy is finishing up 1st grade, and this was to review and plan for 2nd grade. Our last IEP meeting (actually series of meetings) came in at over 12 hours.  And both sides had lawyers on the clock.  As things have been going better lately, we decided to go in without our lawyer (for the first time in a long time).  We figured we could just call a stop at any time and reconvene with the lawyers if they started to throw any curve balls at us. What a refreshing change.  For whatever reason, Buddy Boy has been doing well the last couple of weeks, and I'm sure this helped.  But even in general, things are worlds different than last year.  There haven't been the problems with physical aggression in school like he used to have.  The school has responded by starting to integrate him with his NT  peers for some of the \"specials\" (art, computer, music, and this week, PE).  He's been doing reasonably well, as they've provided an aide to go with him when he does these things (something they adamantly refused to do last year at his other school. Despite his increased success, they haven't tried to decrease the amount of support (OT, language, social skills) he gets, and haven't tried to change his Behavioral Support Plan (we think they just don't want to rewrite this long document that took us months to hammer out last year, but that's OK.  Even though he isn't needing most of if right now, we still want it as a backstop). The team agreed to start Buddy Boy off with inclusion with support in all of the \"specials\" next year (which will only mean adding Spanish class-we figure we can work on getting him up to speed with his peers in Spanish over the summer).   There were only a few minor things we needed changed.  One was that they lumped some of his OCD behaviors (nail biting, playing with fingers) with behaviors he exhibits when he is trying to avoid work.  They didn't object when we pointed out our objections to this.  The other things were getting things written into the plan that had been only verbally agreed to.  We wanted to make certain that there were no ambiguities. We learned of a couple of changes for next year.  One major thing is that his special ed classroom teacher is leaving.  She's been good for him this year, and we're sorry to see her leave.  We'll just have to hope for the best with whoever replaces her.  Luckily at least two of the support people (aide in the class and speech therapist) are going to be the same. We left the meeting feeling happy, though not totally comfortable.  After getting burned big time last year, it's hard not to think that there may be land mines waiting for us around the bend.  Trust is a hard thing to rebuild, once it's lost.  Since many of the players are different this year, we see it as possible, though still difficult. Now it's onwards to summer!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RkTJFIA1LzI/AAAAAAAAAK4/kG0a1Q7wscY/s1600-h/conference+room.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/epc/456554006/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/05/record-time.html", "title": "\nRecord Time\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, May 10, 2007", "body": "\n Well, the last week or so has been pretty good for Buddy Boy (and for us).  We've all settled back into our somewhat regular routines, and our days have been fairly uneventful.  So I guess I'm ready to relate what happened almost three weeks ago now.  I'm not a guy that gets rattled (shaken up) very easily.  Just a month ago I pretty much laughed off  an incident  when Buddy Boy got ahold of Liz's car keys and started up the car in the garage.  But this incident I'm going to describe really upset me, and I'm only now getting my sense of equilibrium back. I awoke at about 5:15 AM (my usual time).  As soon as I exited our bedroom to go to the bathroom down the hall I smelled burnt popcorn.  I immediately got a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach and proceeded downstairs.  I saw (and smelled) the following things in rapid succession (not necessarily in this order): As I passed the family room I heard and saw the TV was on.  Buddy Boy was nowhere to be seen. I followed my nose to the kitchen.  I saw Buddy Boy sitting at the kitchen table eating burnt popcorn out of a bowl that we use for popcorn, which is stored in a cabinet above the refrigerator.  He appeared unharmed, and safe. The top of the hot air popcorn maker was half melted, and it was still half filled with burnt popcorn, which spilled over the counter and floor. There were several pieces of burnt 8.5\" x 11\" pieces of paper on the floor, as well as a big black burnt spot on the kitchen tiles (about 3 feet around).  The air smelled not only of the burnt popcorn, but also of smoke.  Our smoke alarm had not gone off. There was black soot that covered a lot of the stuff in the kitchen (Liz later informed me that she cleaned off soot from things in the dining room and living room, too. I saw a small mound of melted blue wax from a melted birthday candle on the floor. The oven door was open, and a baking pan was sitting on the door of the oven.  The pan was filled with a half baked yellowish mass. After quickly ascertaining that there was no acute danger, I ran to Buddy Boy and hugged him.  And I trembled.  I was scared. I have always had a healthy respect for (and perhaps a little fear of) fire, ever since the time when I was about thirteen, when my then 3 year old brother almost burned down our house with a candle when I was babysitting him and two other siblings.  I managed to extinguish that fire with a fire extinguisher with the only damage being a buckled tile floor, a burnt chest of drawers, and a singed set of curtains.  It was real close to a disaster.  I have always kept several fire extinguishers around the house, have smoke detectors on every floor, and have an escape ladder stored in my closet upstairs.  Our house was built in 1880, and though we have lived in it since 1998, I have yet to light a fire in the fireplace. After quickly ascertaining that Buddy Boy was OK, I decided that this scene was too terrible for Liz to see as is, and that I would try to quickly clean up as much as possible, as fast as possible.  I didn't want Liz to feel the same panic I was feeling. Buddy Boy asked me if it was the middle of the night, and if he should go back to bed.  I just had him sit down. I grabbed the garbage bag out of its container and I started shoveling things into it.  The popcorn and the burnt papers were the first things in.  Then I got a scrub brush to try and get the big burn mark off the tile floor.  I got the majority of it off before Liz walked in.  I filled her in on what I knew, and after a little while she took over while I was able to escape to work. ------------------------------------------ Buddy Boy has become \"sneaky\" as of late.   We keep a \"baby monitor\" in his room (as well as in Sweet Pea's).  Our house walls are solid, and these monitors allow us to hear them if they cry out in the middle of the night (they also allow us to hear single songs on a CD played over and over all night long, too).  Buddy Boy knows we have the monitor in there, and he knows we know if he shuts it off (which he has tried to do a couple of times).  He has learned to be very quiet in tiptoeing out of his room and carefully opening and shutting his bedroom door.  We have caught him a couple of times after sneaking out of his room.  He's never done anything other than watch TV or go to sleep in another room.  Nothing even close to this incident. We've also been battling some sleep issues with Buddy Boy.  We thought Melatonin was working, but had had a few nights where he had a lot of trouble falling (and keeping) asleep.  Eventually he had always gotten to sleep, though. Over the next couple of days, Liz and I pieced together the approximate sequence of events. Buddy Boy has always been quite adept at operating the TV and cable remotes.  When he was two, he couldn't talk, but he had the basic functions of the remote (on/off, volume, channels) mastered.  He now is faster than any of the rest of us at operating the three remotes necessary to control the TV, cable box, and the VCR.  He can scroll thru the menus and find whatever he wants.  We put a password on for the pay per view stuff, as he once ordered up a cartoon movie without asking. Buddy Boy evidently must have come out of his room fairly shortly after we had gone to bed.  He had watched three full length animated movies (as we ascertained from the cable menu).  That alone must have taken him almost 6 hours.  That's when he evidently got hungry, and  moved to the kitchen. Buddy Boy related that he used flour, butter, and water to make himself a \"cake\".  Though proud of his industriousness, he could have burned himself badly handling hot stuff from the oven.   Having failed to make himself something that tasted good, he proceeded to the popcorn.  Again, having overfilled the popcorn maker and left it on too long, another hazard (this time fire) was averted. At some point Buddy Boy decided to play with the birthday candles.  He got them out of their storage place in a high cabinet, and also got some matches out of the same cabinet.  We think he lit the matches from the stove, then lit the candles (we later found the remains of at least three candles, one of them in the living room-he said he wanted to take fire to the fireplace). I consider it just short of a miracle that no one was hurt (not to mention that the house was still intact).  I have thanked G-d many times since that day for protecting our son and the rest of our family.  I have also been mad at myself for not being more careful prior to this. The hardest thing I've done since this is install a metal hook/eye lock on Buddy Boy's bedroom door.  Liz and I talked about it for a couple of days before doing it, but didn't see any other way of assuring  protection for all involved.  Our burgler alarm would alert us if an outside door was breached, but if we activate the inside motion alarms, none of us would be able to walk around without setting it off.  I feel terrible as a father, locking my kid in his room at night.  I think of the wooden box and padded room that were used for discipline in a school that Buddy Boy was in for a while  last year,   and wonder if I am just as bad.  For his part, Buddy Boy has taken the lock on his room in stride.  If this becomes a long term issue, I'll probably talk to the alarm company and get his door wired into the system somehow.  But for now we have the lock.  I tell myself that if Buddy Boy really needed to get out of his room in an emergency that he is stronger than that lock.  And that the act of him breaking the lock would create enough noise that we would hear.  But perhaps I am just placating myself.  All I know is that neither Liz nor myself got a good nights sleep for the two days until we installed the lock (and for a few days after that, too, until we trusted it). We've talked several times with Buddy Boy about several issues (lying, trust, SAFETY) but aren't sure what is sinking in (especially as this incident was less than two weeks after the starting the car incident). But as I started out saying, the last week or so has been good.  Buddy Boy has had several good days leading up to his IEP (I always hate the psychological disadvantage of going into an IEP with recent \"bad\" days having occurred-they seem to become disproportionally important to the \"team\").  And the sleep issues seem to be a bit better, having changed to a prescription med.   I don't know if Buddy Boy will think less of me for having installed the lock, but I do know I need to keep him safe.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RkK0UoA1LyI/AAAAAAAAAKw/V4LwTG_L2O0/s1600-h/angel.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RkKxk4A1LxI/AAAAAAAAAKo/drLq1GXIBeY/s1600-h/P1010279.JPG"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/05/i-believe-in-guardian-angels.html", "title": "\nI Believe in Guardian Angels\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 1, 2007", "body": "\n My blog contribution to \"Blogging against Disablism\" Day Everyone has secret fears for their child with a disability.  For some, it's that their child will grow up alone, without friends.  For others, it's that their child will some day be institutionalized, with all the terror that may involve.  For me, it's that my son will some day be shot and killed because of his autism.  Or rather, because of the fact that he is autistic and black. One of the less pleasant aspects of Buddy Boy's being autistic is that he frustrates rather easily, and responds in what are usually considered inappropriate and belligerant manners.  Don't get me wrong.  95% of the time Buddy Boy is the sweetest kid you'd ever want to meet.  His speech may be a little stilted at times, but he's loving, considerate, smart, and funny.  He's progressed in his ability to control these outbursts as he's matured, but we still have a ways to go (and I don't even want to think about puberty). The other day he ran off the sidewalk into the grass and crashed his bike.  I had been pedaling ahead of him at the time. \"DAD!\" he says, getting up.  He scrunches up his face (looking angry), points his finger right at me, and continues- \"LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE.  HOW DARE YOU!\" A few soothing words and a calm manner result, as they usually do, with a quick de-escalation of hostilities, and a response of \"I'm OK.  Sorry, Dad.\" And father and son continue on their way. But every time such an episode occurs, there is a vague fear stirring in my gut, one which I don't often consciously acknowledge, it is so dark.  One which tells me that 9 years from now, should my son acquire a driver's license, the following might occur during a traffic stop for a minor traffic violation: \"License and registration, please.\" \"What's wrong?  I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!\" \"Just settle down, son.\"  The police officer lightly places his arm on Buddy Boy's.  Buddy Boy flinches and pulls back.  The police officer starts to get nervous at the large black angry teenager.  He places one hand on his gun. \"HOW DARE YOU!  WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!\"  \"Keep your hands on the wheel\".  In the moment, Buddy Boy does not process this as a command.  He has just processed the request for his license and registration. Buddy Boy's initial flare is starting to abate, and he quickly reaches for his wallet to show his license. The reaching for his wallet is misinterpreted as him going for a weapon after being told to keep his hands on the wheel, and... If you think this situation is far fetched, then you don't remember  Amadou Diallo . ___________________________________________________________ Liz and I are parents thru adoption.  We are both white, and the kids are both bi-racial (African American/Caucasion).  Buddy Boy's birthfather was built like a football player, and I expect that Buddy Boy will be a big guy, too.  Before adopting, I considered that one of the biggest problems that we might face was racism.  By the time Buddy Boy was two and a half, I realized that his (yet to be diagnosed) autism was probably going to be our biggest challenge.  Now I realize that both may interact in the future to create unique challenges. \"Driving While Black\"  is a well documented phenomenon, that results in more blacks (especially males) being stopped for traffic violations, and more tickets and searches performed on them.  It's an expected part of growing up black in America.  Even  black police  practice racial profiling.  And it doesn't matter if you're well dressed, or have small children with you.  Johnny Cochrane (O.J.'s famous lawyer) used to be an Assistant District Attorney in Los Angeles.  Once, while well dressed and driving home with his two young children in the car he was stopped by the police, who approached the car with guns drawn.  They removed him from the car, and it was not until they found his badge that they backed off.  It happens to blacks all across America every day.  I do think the police need  some  lattitude in pulling over suspicious looking people.  But they have proven time and time again that \"all blacks look alike\".  It doesn't matter if the black person is well dressed or well mannered.  What the police see is \"potential criminal\". Autism is an \"invisible\" disability.  You're not confined to a wheelchair, you don't need a cane, and your body moves just fine.   [EDIT-Please see my follow up comments in  \"Et Tu, Brute\" ]   In my son's case, he is also very verbal.  His speech at times is stilted, and sometimes scripted, but it takes a bit to pick up on that.  And when you have an invisible disability, people  don't necessarily make  (or feel they have to make) accomodations for you. Police officers are trained to control situations.  They are given authority to keep the peace, and they are also given wide lattitude in enforcing that peace.  Citizens, for their part, are expected to defer to the authority of the police, and resolve conflicts in a court of law.  One thing that the police, in general, have very little training in is relating to autistic citizens. As a result of this lack of training, there are way too many opportunities for misunderstandings that result in escalation of a police officer's response.  Police officers are usually trained in a \" use of force continuum \" where they are expected to use the least amount of force in order to obtain compliance.  A little less than 20% of arrests involve some use of force, and use of force is reported to occur more frequently where drugs, alcohol, or mental illness is involved.  Of note, initial levels of force usually involve the \"laying on of hands\" in some manner on the \"suspect\".  When an autistic person reflexively recoils from contact with someone he doesn't know in a stressful situation, the police officer is then justified in moving up the ladder of the \"use of force continuum\".  This may involve other \"non-lethal\" methods of restraining someone, such as Tasers, which can very definitely be  lethal  at times.  Anytime the officer feels his life (or other citizens around him) are threatened, he is justified in using lethal force. I have no hope of curing racism, bigotry, or racial profiling in the next 9 years.  I do hold out some hope of influencing police forces' education and training in dealing with autistics.  Why?  Autism knows no barriers.  Rich, poor, black, white, everyone gets autism.  And statistically that means that even some police officer's kids are going to end up on the spectrum.  I expect that in many departments some officers will speak up, and demand proper training for their peers.  One study documented that autistics were 7 times more likely to have an encounter with the police than NT's were.  It's in the police forces' self interest to get those encounters right.  Signs of this  beginning to happen  are encouraging. For my part, I have been writing my legislators to advocate for mandatory police training in autism for our state.  And one of the things I am trying to instill in Buddy Boy is compliance with law enforcement officers.  I hope they listen in time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadou_Diallo", "http://academic.udayton.edu/race/03justice/dwb01.htm", "http://www.olimu.com/Journalism/Texts/Commentary/RacialProfiling.htm", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/article346.html", "http://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles1/nij/176330.txt", "http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special43/articles/1224taserlist24-ON.html", "http://www.autismriskmanagement.com/conference.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/05/dark-thoughts.html", "title": "\nDark Thoughts\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 8, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit- Steve Brandon St. Louis Police Chief Joe Mokwa announced Monday that a special law enforcement task-force has been assigned to the Christian Ferguson case.   He was 9 years old when he mysteriously disappeared from the SUV his father was driving, at a north St. Louis intersection, on June 11, 2003. Dawan Ferguson told police that Christian was in his car when it was stolen. Dawan had gotten out of his vehicle to use a pay phone at Skinker and Page. ... So begins a story from the  online site of KSDK , a TV station in St. Louis, Missouri.  It's not unusual that the police would take a close look at such a case.   ...Mokwa said the new task-force will consist of a sergeant, two detectives, two FBI agents, and a command officer. ... which are a lot of resources to devote to just one case.  What's even more unusual is that they are doing so in a case where the victim was poor, black, and severely physically and developmentally disabled (as far as I know he was not autistic, but you get the point). In this case, the father of the child reported that he stopped to use a pay phone, and left the child in the car.  While he was reportedly on the phone he says that the car was carjacked.  The empty car was found two hours later a few miles away. There were many inconsistencies in the story, such as the fact that the father had a cell phone in the car at the time, and a witness who reported seeing the car at the place where it was found at approximately the same time that it was reported stolen.  The police reportedly never believed the father's story, but have turned up no evidence of foul play thus far. I've been  critical , as well as  worried , regarding how society and law enforcement deal with the death and treatment of disabled individuals.  So I have to be even handed and give props to Chief Mokwa of the St. Louis police department for pursuing this case, even though the family is not wealthy or politically connected, and even though the child was severely disabled.  The world would be a better place if there were more such individuals who recognized the humanity in  all  individuals, and who were willing to stand up for those without the power or means to stand up for themselves. Lastly, let's hope that anyone that knows anything with regards to what really happened will stand up and be counted.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RkDQ3YA1LwI/AAAAAAAAAKg/uemsckUYG_U/s1600-h/433237421_4b82d397e1_m.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/steve-brandon/433237421/", "http://www.ksdk.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=118674"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/05/encouraging-sign.html", "title": "\nAn Encouraging Sign\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 30, 2007", "body": "\n We Love Fountains It's been a hectic couple of weeks around the clubhouse lately.  We had an incident almost two weeks ago that scared us, and I still can't write about it (maybe later).  Let's just say for now that sleep (and the lack of it) has been a major factor in all of our lives lately.  This has left us on edge while we prepare for an upcoming IEP meeting.  Buddy Boy's days have been up and down, and all of our nerves have been on edge. I took a bike ride this morning (I often go out on Sunday mornings-it's kind of like rolling meditation for me).   Then I took the kids on a ride when I got back.  We went to the park on our bikes, and it worked out fairly well.  Buddy Boy rolled off the sidewalk a few times and crashed on the way to and from the park (the sidewalk's fairly narrow), but he didn't have any escalating meltdowns (just a couple of short easily controlled ones) and we all had fun. After we got back and cleaned up Liz suggested we all go to the local botannical garden for a walk.  It was a beautiful day in the land of Club 166.  It was in the low 80's F (28-29 C), not too humid, and sunny.  A bit warmer than usual for this time of year, but a great day for a walk. There's just something about a walk in a garden that just helps lift burdens from your shoulders.  It's really hard to be upset when you're surrounded by such beauty.  There were a lot of nice azaleas blooming, although there were also quite a few that had suffered in a late freeze that we had a few weeks ago.  But the blooming ones made up for those that had their flowers damaged. Buddy Boy said he liked the flowers when asked, but spent most of his attention on the fountains, water lines, and rocks.  He has always loved fountains.  About the only thing he likes better than a functioning fountain is one that has been drained, so that he can see all the pipes and nozzles and such that are usually underwater. We walked thru the Japanese garden, and the kids (and I) fed the koi.  The kids knelt down at the water's edge and fed the fish, and didn't even fall in.  Truly a success!  Sweet Pea complained some about being tired of walking, but managed to do alright.  She's the toe walker in the family.  She's worn splints and had her legs casted for 6 weeks last year (she was also the only 3 year old I know of to get Botox injections), but still has to be reminded to pick up her toes and walk on her heels.  She's also just not as much an outdoors person as Buddy Boy is.  He'll hike all day (although he likes to stop a lot and dig and such-but hey, that's what hiking in the outdoors is all about, right?).  But Sweet Pea balks at walking any more than around a mall.   She'll be a perfect teenager. The $8 admission for Liz and I (kids are free) was cheap therapy.  We spent a couple of hours surrounded by beauty, with a soft breeze, sunny skies, and the sounds of running water.  Who could ask for more.  The kids were fairly well behaved (for siblings), and both had a good time.  Just the bit of respite that we needed. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RjViV4A1LqI/AAAAAAAAAJw/ULNzJOVN9oo/s1600-h/P4290266.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RjVlOIA1LrI/AAAAAAAAAJ4/KkJaMs8CLGs/s1600-h/P4290268.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RjVmkoA1LsI/AAAAAAAAAKA/6BedXJ5cZAg/s1600-h/P4290271.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RjVovYA1LtI/AAAAAAAAAKI/PGNCEcaxHZ0/s1600-h/P4290275_edited.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RjVru4A1LuI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/LvyzkiR59Lo/s1600-h/P4290277.JPG"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/04/just-nice-day.html", "title": "\nJust a Nice Day\n"},
{"date": "Friday, May 4, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit-  SeraphimC What could be worse than making an ignorant statement regarding someone with a disability?  Why, to make it on Blogging Against Disablism day, on your blog, while blogging against disablism! Two days ago I wrote about my fears regarding when societal attitudes regarding race intersect with ingrained reactions of police when they encounter citizens with autism.  And, as  Tokah  pointed out, while talking about how autism is an invisible disability, I said,  \"...You're not confined to a wheelchair,  you don't need a cane, and your body moves just fine. ...\" Tokah rightly (and kindly) pointed out that a chair is an instrument that facilitates mobility, and not one of confinement. At first, I couldn't believe I had actually said what I did.  I didn't remember saying that, and had to go back and check the text to see that I had.  I mean, I'm in the middle of blogging about attitudes about the disabled, and then I say something totally ignorant.  Especially considering I spent almost a year (I said a year in my reply to Tokah, but it was really only 11 months) in a chair when I was young.  One would think that having gone thru that experience, I would be a little more careful in my language.  But evidently I subconciously incorporated that time as being \"confined\" to a wheelchair, even though I've always felt that that experience gave me special insight into the lives of those who always need to depend on a chair to get around. When I was 13 I had an operation on my legs.  When I started high school, I was in the chair for all but the last month of my first year.  In retrospect, it was a little unusual, as new people I met initially assumed I was permanently disabled.  I got a lot of that \"poor you\" pity thing, where I could tell people felt sorry for me because of the chair.  I also felt that a lot of people never saw past the chair, and for them, that was how I was defined.   I don't know if my thought process of thinking of myself as being \"confined\" to a wheelchair was a thought that I developed myself, or whether it was the attitudes of those around me that I incorporated.  I've changed a lot since those days, and consider myself to be relatively enlightened when it comes to disablism, but my writing that two days ago indicates that there are places inside me that I didn't really know existed. I am not a high quality wordsmith like many who blog.  But I do realize the importance of language.  How we name things and talk about things does matter.  And while I am a firm believer in free speech and don't feel that the whole world has to be \"PC\", I am also a firm believer in courtesy and respect for other individuals.  So for any others that noticed my gaffe, I apologize, and I'll try to do better. --------------------------------------------------- I'll be out of town for a little R and R and probably offline until late Monday.  See y'all when I get back! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Rjq4VIA1LvI/AAAAAAAAAKY/vlEXJ3FtBFU/s1600-h/wheelchair.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/seraphimc/102546052/", "http://tokah.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/05/et-tu-brute.html", "title": "\nEt tu, Brute?\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 28, 2007", "body": "\n photo-Buddy Boy on a zip line Tonight we went to a gymnastics event. It was a fundraiser for Autism Speaks (indirectly). The fundraiser was sponsored by Buddy Boy's school, who sponsors a team annually for the Autism Walk in our town each year. The walk used to raise money for NAAR (National Alliance for Autism Research). NAAR is one of the organizations that Autism Speaks has merged with/absorbed. Thousands walk each fall in the annual Autism Walk, and it's a big deal. Teams walk and raise money thru pledges and other events, such as the one we attended tonight. Now that NAAR has been absorbed into Autism Speaks, the money goes to them to sponsor research. Like many, I don't feel that \"Autism Speaks\" for me. They propagate a message that portrays autistics (my son included) as a damaged, hideous individual, who should have been prevented if possible. There are certainly some within Autism Speaks who do not feel this way, but their videos are denigrating to autistics, to say the least. The event tonight was sponsored, like I mentioned, by Buddy Boy's school. Buddy Boy is in a special ed class (with a minimal amount of \"push in\" time into a regular class) at a regular public school. The school as a whole sponsors a team for the Autism Walk each year. I'm sure that the majority of the people that are on the team are good, well meaning people. And if all the money raised goes to legitimate research, I wouldn't have much problem with it (though I do think more money needs to be spent on education, and less on research). Most of the people I know locally in the \"autism community\" are nice people.  Sure, some of them are into biomedical treatments (I don't know of any chelators or HBO users), and many still feel (from reading a local listserve) that thimerasol/mercury is the primary cause of autism.  But most are very similar to the majority of parents I know thru this blog, working every day to take care of and educate their kids, and fighting the same battles with the school system as we do. So it's with mixed emotions that I go to events like tonight's.  It cost us only $10 a person for each kid (parents were free).  The gymnastics center donated their space, time, and personnel to assist in the event.  The kids have both taken classes at this facility, and I knew that they'd have a good time (they actually both had a great time).  And it's a nice way to socialize with some of the other families in our community (like many, socializing of any sort is rare for us).  Just being able to get out and talk to others in similar situations to oneself is somewhat cathartic (it's almost as good as blogging :] ). But everywhere I look during this \"Autism awareness\" month of April (here in the states) it seems that the predominant image I see is that of Autism Speaks.  The majority of events that are fundraisers seem to be raising money for them.  And their message is not the one that I'd like to see be the predominant one when it comes to how autism is represented to the community. Perhaps as Autism Speaks matures they will come to have a more inclusive and positive message.  But until then I have to decide if I will walk in the Autism Walk this year.  I'm thinking that I probably will (to show solidarity with local families), but if I do I'll then have to decide what t-shirt to wear for the occasion.  Depending on my mood, I could go for either one  advertising autism-hub , or if I'm feeling more radical, make up a custom one with \"Exclusion=Extinction\" stenciled on it (as suggested by Zaecus Celestis in a comment to  this post )\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RjK4uYA1LpI/AAAAAAAAAJo/rd079pqhs0o/s1600-h/zip+line.jpg", "https://www.spreadshirt.com/shop.php?op=article&article_id=1343740#top"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/04/mixed-emotions.html", "title": "\nMixed Emotions\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 24, 2007", "body": "\n Photo credit-  kirkland73 Somewhere this last week, on someone's blog, I read about a person's son having services dropped at school because he was doing well academically. I've been looking all day, and now can't find whose blog it was on. I like to link to the original sources of the ideas I get, but can't find it now. As I recall, the blogger in question raised the quite legitimate questions of what about preparing their child for \"real world\" skills. Things like communication, independent transportation, doing laundry, etc. Indeed, the closer one's child gets to \"aging out\" of the educational system and the few supports it provides, the more one's mind turns to the question of \"What's next?\" and \"Is he prepared?\". Susan Senator, on  her blog , has recently been advocating forming a new organization called \"Autism Works\" to deal with some of the challenges that autistic adults face. But rather than talk about future projects (which I totally support and feel are worthwhile), I'd like to talk about what the IDEA law says now about services to prepare your child for living in society. My apologies to non-US readers, as this law applies to the US only. First of all, one of my favorite disability law reference sites, which I reference  a lot  is  Wrightslaw.com . It's a one-stop smorgasborg of just about anything that you would want to know in regards to disability rights law. As dull and boring reading law is (I always thought practicing law would be fun, except for all that dull, boring reading I'd have to do), there is a lot to be learned that is useful when going into an IEP meeting. The IDEA 2004 regs are finally in effect, and some of the things that this latest iteration says are actually good for us. One of the things that struck me when I read that post on the other blog last week was the old (but still used) dodge of \"If they're doing well academically, they don't need services.\" That is, of course, patently absurd. This was not true before the IDEA 2004 was released, and is even less true now. From the Wrightslaw site: ...The requirements about using present levels of functional performance to develop functional goals in the IEPs of all children with disabilities (below) are in IDEA 2004, the federal special education regulations, and the Commentary. ... Furthermore, the idea of \"functional goals\" is addressed: ...Functional means nonacademic, as in \u201croutine activities of everyday living.\u201d This clarification should help IEP Teams understand that the purpose of the IEP is to prepare children with disabilities for life after school. this should also help the school understand that teaching children how to \"function\" in the world is just as important as teaching academic skills. \"It is not necessary to include a definition of \"functional\" in these regulations because we believe it is a term that is generally understood to refer to skills or activities that are not considered academic or related to a child\u2019s academic achievement. Instead, \"functional\" is often used in the context of routine activities of everyday living.\" (Commentary in the Federal Register, page 46661) ... So this basically says that  all  children with a disability need  functional  goals set for them in their IEP. And these goals are to help them prepare for life  after  school, not just to function in school. Another useful change in IDEA 2004 is the change in definition of the term \"Transition Services\". Again from Wrightslaw: ...(34) TRANSITION SERVICES - The term `transition services' means a coordinated set of activities for a child with a disability that-- (A) is designed  to be a results-oriented process, that is focused on improving the academic and functional achievement of the child with a disability to facilitate the child's  movement from school to post-school activities, including post-secondary education, vocational education, integrated employment (including supported employment), continuing and adult education, adult services, independent living, or community participation; (B)  is based on the individual child\u2019s needs,  taking into account the child's strengths, preferences, and interests...\" (Note: the  underlined  words are new in IDEA 2004) ... By law, transition services have to start no later than when the student turns 16 years old. So it appears that the law, like society in general, is starting to move towards consideration of what happens after a person \"ages out\" of the special education system. At least the law is supporting providing meaningful training of students for life after school. Even though Buddy Boy is only 7 now, I know the time will come very quickly when we will need to make some major decisions about how he will live. A lot will be determined by how much progress he makes over the next several years, as well as what his preferences are (further schooling vs. joining the workforce, living at home vs. somewhere else, etc.). Now we just need to get laws passed that actually provide support for autistic adults.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Ril-yXUeNCI/AAAAAAAAAJY/kRwiSV0XBOM/s1600-h/bus.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/7485058@N05/434971475/", "http://susansenator.com/blog/2007/04/autism-works-thoughts-i.html", "http://www.wrightslaw.com/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/04/ieps-and-non-academic-goals.html", "title": "\nIEP's and non-academic goals\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 23, 2007", "body": "\n photo- this morning on my cell phone One of the blogs I follow on a regular basis is by  Joeymom .  She's a great mom who teaches art history in Virginia (and how could I  not  like a mom who names her kid Joe?).  In one of her recent posts,   \"The Parent Role at an IEP Meeting\" , she very humorously recounted how being a parent at an IEP meeting is like being a passenger on a plane. ...However, on an IEP Flight, you as the passenger are also expected to understand how to fly the plane, serve the other passengers, and have full knowledge of how to maintain and even fix mechanical and other problems mid-flight. If an engine falls off, you're expected to know how to safely land the plane, re-attach the engine, and get the whole mess back in the air. The pilot won't set course or work the instruments unless you spefically request that s/he do so, and then often says they don't have the resources for working the controls anyway, and besides, do you really NEED to work all those buttons, levers, and gauges? Can't you see fron the windshield where you are going? When you go to find resources to help, you find a flight simulator; but you soon find it is either for an outdated cockpit, a simplified cockpit, or when you go to actually request the controls be worked properly, you are told that you just had simulator training, the pilot has had real flight time! So you try to sign up for flying lessons. Now you're told that you're still just an amateur. But they still won't work the controls unless you specifically ask them to do so, and say exactly what to do and exactly when. ... While I found Joeymom's description very amusing, I thought it was not quite right, as the flight crew on a plane are personally invested in having a safe flight for themselves, as well as the passengers.  If the plane crashes, they're also out of luck.  That's not true with our kids' educations.  I suggested that perhaps IEP's are more akin to being forced to work with a contractor who only builds wood houses, except that you have supplied him stucco to work with. While out on a bike ride this morning, I was thinking of another analogy of what it's like to work with the IEP \"team\". Say you are a cyclist, and a new road is being built in your neighborhood.  The law says that cyclists are entitled to ride on the roads, but most motorists in their cars are not cyclists, and don't particularly appreciate having cyclists \"clogging up\" their roads.  You have to go to the municipal meeting/department of transportation/whoever is in charge of building the road to convince them of what they need to do to make the new roads friendly and accessable for bicycles. The problem is, although people on this committee have read about cycling and road construction, none of them is a cyclist, and many of them also feel that you are asking for something extra when you are talking to them regarding things such as bicycle friendly road grates, bicycle lanes, and traffic signal sensors that recognize cyclists. The people on the committee also let you know that  they  are the professionals, not you, so you should just leave everything to them.  They seem not to be able to comprehend plain language suggestions made by you, and insist that everything be put into the technical language that they are accustomed to using. The committee tells you that there is only so much money for road construction, and they can't afford to spend so much accomodating cyclists.  After all, they are already putting in curb cuts for wheelchairs, why should they also have to spend money accomodating you, too? And all you keep asking for is a way to get to your destination using your bike. So, how would you describe an IEP (or whatever your country's equivalent) meeting?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RiveOnUeNDI/AAAAAAAAAJg/nkP9Aw5ZF1k/s1600-h/bike+lane.jpg", "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/", "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/04/parent-role-at-iep-meeting.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/04/ieps-are-like.html", "title": "\nIEP's are like ...?\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 20, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit-   =Doy Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBO, HBOT) has been proposed as a \"cure\" for autism. There is a  little  theoretical basis for this, if you consider autism as a form of brain damage. There are some papers (but no conclusive evidence) that HBO  may  be beneficial in patients with acute and chronic brain injury, as well as multiple sclerosis and cerebal palsy. None of these indications is supported by one of the major professional organizations involved with HBO, the  Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) , as the only papers with proper controls show no definite improvement. The UHMS holds open the possibility that certain subgroups of brain injured patients may be shown to benefit from HBO. Classically, HBO was first instituted as a treatment for divers suffering from \"the bends\", which is caused by too much nitrogen dissolving in your blood under pressure when diving, then \"bubbling out\" into your joints (and other spaces) when you surfaced.  The indications for HBO have been widened to include things such as air gas embolism (bubbles of air or other gases in your brain or other places they don't belong), carbon monoxide poisoning, certain soft tissue and bony infections, to promote healing in problem wounds and skin grafts, and brain abscesses. I recently saw an announcement that a hyperbaric center was going to start a study of HBO use in autism.  As I don't completely discount that it might have some effects, studying it would be a good thing.  Then I took a look at the announcement: ...The Hyperbaric Medicine Center's Autism Study begins this month with 20 children, and each child will be treated with 20 hours of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Each child will be tested by experienced clinicians in the community both before and after their 20 hours of therapy, and the results are expected to be published by late June, 2007.  ... While you certainly can't believe everything you read in the paper, if this is the stuy's design, it sucks.  There's one thing worse than no scientific data on a subject.  That's data obtained from poorly designed and poorly performed experiments.  I see no mention of a triple blind (subjects, people performing interventions, and testers all blinded to who got what) study with a placebo control group.  Without such a design, you can't believe anything that comes out of this study. I've been vaguely aware that HBO was being advocated by some for treatment of autism, but was unaware of how widespread this practice was, and how exactly it was being instituted, until  Autism Diva pointed me to an old post of hers on the subject . I had previously believed, when I heard that parents were using HBO to treat autism, that they were buying time at recognized hyperbaric chambers. These chambers are often located in hospitals, are staffed by professionals, and are costly to operate. Silly me. What most people using HBO in autism are using is the  Vitaeris 320 , which is billed as a \"Mild Hyperbaric Chamber\". These chambers develop pressures up to almost 1.3 atm (the equivalent of being at the bottom of a 11 foot swimming pool) rather than the 3 atm (66 feet) or more capability of \"real\" hyperbaric chambers. The Vitaeris \"chamber\" is really a pressurized zippered bag. It was originally designed as a portable device that mountain climbers could take with them to combat mild altitude sickness. It is now sold to doctors offering hyperbaric treatment for \"unconventional\" indications (like multiple sclerosis, cerebal palsy, and autism). Some of these doctors  (as well as some parents that have also bought these chambers with a doctor's prescription) have added supplemental oxygen to their chambers, in order to increase the amount of oxygen that is supplied during the procedure. This is where the real danger in using this therapy lies. Up until I read about the oxygen being added to these \"Mild Hyperbaric Chambers\" I wasn't overly concerned about using HBO to treat autism. Like all unproven treatments, there is concern about incurring even small unnecessary risks. But if autistics were being treated in \"real\" HBO chambers, they were being tended to by trained and certified technicians, who followed accepted protocols and safety precautions.  There is minimal (though not zero) risk associated with \"diving\" in a hyperbaric chamber. The most common risks entail claustrophobia (unless you  like  being zipped in an over sized piece of luggage), barotrauma (damage to your ears, lungs, or sinuses from not \"equalizing\" pressures properly), and temporary vision changes. Properly  used, there is little risk of danger in using the Vitaeris 320, or similar \"mild\" hyperbaric devices. The pressures developed are a lot less than conventional chambers, and supplementing oxygen to the chamber is not supported by the company's literature. This is probably why the FDA does not require the presence of specially trained personnel to use these \"mild\" HBO chambers. Supplementing oxygen in any way when using these chambers (either with an external oxygen concentrator supplying O2 to an air intake, or by administering bottled oxygen within the chamber) totally changes the risk equation.   photo credit- NASA Although it has been 40 years since the  Apollo 1 tragic fire  that killed it's three astronauts, the principles still apply. Enriched oxygen environments (especially under pressure) are dangerous. That is why conventional chambers are regulated, inspected, and have specially trained individuals operating them. So the bottom line? \"Mild Hyperbaric Chambers\" are expensive toys in the treatment of autism. They expose those treated to minimal risks, but are certainly safer than something like chelation. Those who add oxygen to these chambers, on the other hand, incur extreme risk of fire and explosion. There is no science to support the use of HBO in the treatment of autism at present, and the only study I see scheduled is likely flawed from the outset.  But my greatest ire is reserved for those who should know better (doctors) and yet not only provide treatments that are not useful, they are downright dangerous.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Rh7RmrGufvI/AAAAAAAAAJA/ARobWCS8m1s/s1600-h/scuba+diver.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/doy/417265370/", "http://www.uhms.org/POSITIONPAPERS/position%20papers.htm", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2006/09/playing-with-fire.html", "http://www.oxyhealth.com/Vitaeris%20320.htm", "http://www.wholisticpeds.com/default.asp?cid=956655663&n1=23", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Riafj5DFZbI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/L_ehN5dHImQ/s1600-h/180px-Apollo_1_fire.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/04/under-pressure.html", "title": "\nUnder Pressure\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 18, 2007", "body": "\nBy now virtually the whole world has heard of the mass  murder/suicide  in Virginia two days ago. We, as human beings, try to categorize things to understand them. We search for meaning and for signals, that we may avert tragedy the next time. We want understanding of motives that would push someone to randomly kill innocents. The one thing that I have not heard, that I have been fearing that I would, is the \"A\" word. Someone saying that the shooter was somewhere on the spectrum. Earlier this year we had the  Odgren  case, where a student with Asperger's fatally stabbed a fellow student. In the search for meaning in that case students with Asperger's were characterized as potentially violent. In the aftermath of this tragedy in Virginia, I have heard the gunman described as basically non-verbal, as well as being totally socially isolated. In his only attempts at interaction with the opposite sex, he was totally inappropriate, engaging in behaviors that the women took to be stalking. One \"expert\" on mass murderers opined that the shooters total social isolation was a \"red flag\" that he was potentially very dangerous. I am so sorry that the event happened. And so relieved (for now) that the \"A\" word hasn't been associated with it. Autism has gotten such a bad rap when it comes to violence.  School officials have no reservations when it comes to having children as young as  5  or  6  arrested by the police for acting out in class. I fear that they will call in police now to investigate all of those who are deemed to be \"totally socially isolated\". I have no way of knowing whether the shooter in Virginia was on the spectrum. But I also have little doubt that, had he survived, his lawyers would have trotted out someone to say that he was, and that this was the \"cause\" of him acting the way he did. I also know that when it comes to violence and autistics, that they are most often  on the receiving end . But no one gets too upset about that. People are calling Cho Seung-Hui \"pure evil\". I see him as a seriously disturbed young man who did a terible thing. Being disturbed does not excuse his actions. It does not even \"explain\" them.  Some things are beyond explanation. I mourn for the victims of Monday's shooting. Edit: After coming home today and seeing some of the material that the shooter had sent to NBC, it is obvious that he was anything but autistic.

{"date": "Tuesday, April 10, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit- Winery Finery Liz related this story to me this morning, while I was getting ready for work. Yesterday morning, after dropping Buddy Boy off at school, she stopped at a gas station and purchased a diet root beer to drink.  Sweet Pea was still in the car.  Liz didn't notice that the drink was nearly frozen, and when she opened it it sprayed all over the inside of the car, as well as all over her. Fortunately she was near home, and returned there to change her clothes (and finish cleaning the car).  After telling Sweet Pea she had to change her clothes, Sweet Pea said \"Don't take off your breasts.\" \"What?\", Liz asked. Sweet Pea repeated it. \"Did you mean my bra, sweetie, or my breasts?\" \"Don't take off your breasts.\"  Liz wonders, is there someone at school whose mom has breast cancer, and now Sweet Pea is afraid that Liz will lose her breasts? \"But honey, they're attached to me.  They're a part of me.  They're not going anywhere.\" \"No, mom.  You know, the thing that keeps you from jiggling all around.\" \"Oh, OK.  That's my bra.  It's not wet.  I don't have to change that.\" ----------------------------------------------- Buddy Boy is now very verbal.  He developed language a little late (he only had a couple of words by the time he was 2 and a half), but rapidly picked up language with speech therapy.  A lot of times his spoken communication \"borrows\" things from books he's read, or movies he's seen.  His speech is also somewhat stilted and halting at times.  But, all in all, he's  very verbal . But because he's very verbal, I think he is often judged as being oppositional and purposely bad, rather than it being understood that he might not be processing something quite the same as intended, or that he has other problems related to his autism (like OCD) that are making it harder for him to comply.   It seems that the fact that he's verbal gets him \"automatically\" placed into the high functioning autism (HFA) category.  This also means that along with being verbal, since he is seen as HFA he is also expected to be \"high functioning compliant\".  Teachers and school administrators might understand when a non-verbal/minimally verbal student doesn't comply (perhaps falsely assuming that they have no communication skills), but they also make errors in the opposite direction, assuming that once one is  verbal, you should also be \"normal\" in other aspects of your life. Like many people in the \"autism community\", I don't like the terms HFA and LFA.  There are too many assumptions and prejudices built into those terms, and they really are very heavily weighted by how verbal a person is, which is not the end all and be all of communicating or functioning in general.  But society in general, and our schools in our neck of the woods, try to put each kid into a \"box\" (usually figuratively, though sometimes  literally ), instead of taking the time and making the effort to acurately evaluate and work with their strengths and weaknesses.   I've been thinking about this a lot, as we head towards another IEP next month (the first one since going full time in Buddy Boy's present school placement).   Sometimes it seems no matter how much effort we put into writing the IEP (and explaining things to his teachers), there still seams to be a breakdown in communication between us.  Which makes me wonder how much of Buddy Boy's communication is being lost or misinterpreted at school.  Oh well, time will tell. Until then, for my part I'm just glad that Sweet Pea said \"jiggling\" instead of \"sagging\".  I would have paid for her comment a long time if she had. Note:  I have a big conference that I am helping to run this coming weekend.  I may not post again until Monday or Tuesday.   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Rhuq4LGufuI/AAAAAAAAAI4/Eijig0y7s6A/s1600-h/telephone+wires.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/le_vignoble/250272714/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/04/clear-communication.html", "title": "\nClear Communication\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 7, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit  Orrin \"Guess what your son did today?  Go ahead, I bet you can't guess.\" When Buddy Boy is \"my son\", I know it must have been something particularly egregious. \"I went shopping today and picked up a new outfit for Sweet Pea, and when we came home I took her upstairs to her room to try it on.  I left Buddy Boy in the kitchen eating a sandwich\" \"Yea, well, OK, what did he do?\" \"I was only upstairs for 5 minutes.  When I came down I couldn't find him.  I spent about a minute searching the house and screaming his name.  The front door was still closed.\" By this point Liz is getting visibly more upset, reliving what was obviously traumatic to her.  I, being the sensitive type (and realizing that I did not get a frantic call in the middle of the day, the house had not burned down, and the kids were both in the house) chuckled in anticipation of a good story.  I just  knew  that with all this buildup, there was a good story coming.  Perhaps this was not the ideal response. \"I went into the garage and he had the car running.  The lights were on, the windshield wipers were on, and fluid was spurting out.  And the garage door was still closed.\" Well, obviously this was a potential serious safety hazard, but all had come out all right.  So I did the obvious thing.  I laughed.  All I could think of was my friend Dave's kid, who had managed to get their car rolling down their driveway and across the street into a neighbor's driveway, when he was two.  Yet another milestone that Buddy Boy was behind in. \"He had to fish the keys out of my purse.  He could have driven the car into the house, or into the neighbor's house.  He could have been thrown from the car.  He could have died from carbon monoxide poisoning.\" OK, so the CO poisoning was a real threat, but the only realistic one.  And also pretty unlikely, as we never let Buddy Boy out of our site for more than 5 minutes, just because he is a little  mischievous .  Liz's car is an automatic, and there is a brake interlock.  You have to depress the brake pedal to get the car in gear.  His legs aren't long enough (yet). \"Maybe next time I'll tell him to drive your car, you seem so nonchalant.\" Neither of the kids were in the room.  I could put on my \"daddy's upset\" face later.  For now, I was just enjoying the moment. Most every kid (at least most every boy) dreams of driving from at least the age of 2 (and even sooner if you watch \"The Simpsons\" opening segment).  We have known that Buddy Boy has wanted to drive since he could talk (about 3 years old). Buddy Boy's bus drivers have related to us many times that he asks them what certain buttons and levers do, and he asks them questions about how to do certain things (like turn on the windshield wipers).  He asks us those questions, too, when we are driving, but we aren't so foolish as to actually give him answers.  We knew he'd go ahead and try to drive himself.  He's told us multiple times that he knows how to drive.  He even made himself a \"driver's license\" one day out of cardboard, when I told him he needed one to drive.  Drew a picture of himself on there and everything.  I was impressed. We all hope that all of our kids will be successful once they grow up.  Success takes many forms.  But driving a car is a big deal for most kids as they grow up, as it represents (and enables) freedom.  Freedom from your parents, freedom to do what  you  want to do.  Freedom to apply for jobs not accessible to public transportation. So I hope that Buddy Boy will be able to drive some day.  It will be OK if he doesn't, but it would be great if he can.  And though I'll lecture him about the \"safety violation\" that \"driving\" at his age entails, I won't try to dampen his ambition to drive, or to do any of the other things that will help him to become successful and happy in life. And next time I'll even try to be more sympathetic to Liz. Edit-Since writing this I have sat down and talked to Buddy Boy about this.  Of course, he is able to parrot back to me all of the bad things that could have happened.  But when we get to talking about how the car could have hit someone or something, he just shrugs his shoulders and says \"But the handbrake was on.  It couldn't move.  I couldn't get the handbrake off.  I wasn't strong enough.\"  And at the end, after talking about CO poisoning, and how dead is forever, and how much we were really worried about him, his final response was- \"But I had to test my driving skills.\"   I had to bite my lip. Joe is 212 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RhbuAFiM3gI/AAAAAAAAAIw/9gZwae2QtQ8/s1600-h/driving.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/orrin/133095459/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/04/driving-ambitions.html", "title": "\nDriving Ambitions\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 6, 2007", "body": "\n In the US, the central event in getting a free appropriate public education (FAPE)  for your child is the IEP (Individualized Education Plan) meeting.  In theory, the meeting is a convocation of all the people that are involved in your child's education, including the parents as equal partners.  Teachers, OT's, SLP's, the school principal, autism specialist, etc. are all to join together  with you  to come up with the most appropriate plan for the coming year(s).  Unfortunately, in practice one often feels as if they were on trial in a courtroom in a dictatorship.  Many things go on behind the scenes, many are pre-scripted, and it often feels futile to raise any objections to what the \"court\" has already decided.    I've been thinking about these meetings while reading some of the things  one of my fellow bloggers  has been going thru (read her March 28th and April 4th posts). In retrospect, one of the decisions that I made early on that has served us well over the last two years is that I decided to go to absolutely as many IEP's as possible for my son.  This proved difficult at times last year, as the school seemingly dragged out meetings (taking hours to talk about things we could have covered in less than 30 minutes, then trying to cram discussion of all of the accomodations into the last 30 minutes).  They would then seem incensed when we would refuse to be steamrolled and insist on scheduling another meeting to finish discussions in a deliberate manner.  As the school fought us tooth and nail for everything we thought was appropriate, we had several meetings a month for a few months, all scheduled during business hours.  As a lot of these meetings were scheduled at short notice, I was fortunate that my work was willing to be flexible and give me vacation time when I needed it. I fully realize that having both parents attend IEP meetings is not physically possible for many people.  People that don't have understanding bosses, not wanting to upset the apple cart at work in a job that you need for the health insurance, being a single parent, and loads of things I probably haven't thought of conspire against having both parents able to show up (once, we couldn't get a sitter for our kids, so even though I took off work I had to stay with them while Liz went to the meeting).  But if you can swing it, I think it makes a world of difference. First of all, one can usually forget about the IEP meeting being a friendly meeting between friends wanting the best for your child.  At it's best, the IEP meeting is a business meeting,  And \"Friends is friends, but business is business\" as one of my old bosses I worked for in college used to say.  So even though you may consider yourself on good relations with the school, this is still a business meeting where bargaining of (potentially costly) services takes place.  It's always good to have another person on your team sitting there while everyone is talking.  If nothing else, the person can help to check facts, keep notes, and help you remember all of the points that you wanted to bring up.  It's harder for them to distract both of you at the same time (not that they'd  purposely  do that). Secondly, if one parent goes to the meeting, it is almost always the mother.  Mom's make up the vast majority of the front line personnel that deal with the schools, both on a daily basis, as well as in IEP  meetings.  It's just the way it is.  So the school system is set up to deal with females, for the most part.  And when they want to \"play politics\" and manipulate you in a meeting, they are all set up to manipulate the mom.  They aren't as set up to intimidate men.  They try to use women's inherent nature to \"get along\" more than men to get them to agree with things that \"the rest of the team sees as reasonable\".  They also try to manipulate the mom by subtly reminding her that it's really in her best interest to get along with the teachers, who she has to deal with every day, so she shouldn't complain too much in the IEP meeting.  Also, if only the mom is there, it's  much easier to paint any individual disagreement as the intransigence of \"one person\", you. Third, it's easier for Liz and I to play \"Good Parent, Bad Parent\", or it's variant \"Knowledgeable Parent, Parent who needs everything explained to them\" (I can play dumb well).  These two things allow Liz to keep up her good relations with the teachers while I am painted as the rough around the edges, bull in a china shop parent.  Liz can sit there reading her notes while I point out how what they are proposing violates what I understand about what is supposed to be provided under IDEA (the law that governs services to disabled kids).  At particularly emotionally  trying times during a meeting, it's easier for us to be tag team wrestlers, spelling each other while one of us continues to press them ( n.b., while I think fighting and military metaphors are inappropriate when referring to treating and accomodating autistics, unfortunately they are often all too appropriate when it comes to dealing with school systems ). Finally, having a  male in the room on our side changes the way they treat us.  They're just more civil.  This is not just my feeling, but has also been related to me by two different advocates we have had, as well as our lawyer.  Somehow, they think it's OK to bully a woman alone, but don't do it as much when there's a man with her.  An old, sexist hangover if ever there was one, but I'll use it if it helps me get the necessary accomodations for Buddy Boy.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RhWXC1iM3eI/AAAAAAAAAIg/UtlIFPeGVeA/s1600-h/conference+room.jpg", "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/04/real-men-go-to-ieps.html", "title": "\nReal Men Go to IEP's\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 4, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit  Cindytoo I've been thinking of some seemingly unrelated things lately. Death and dying, the American justice system, and autism. In 1969,  Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, MD  wrote  \"On Death and Dying\",  a classic text that outlines the psychological stages that most people go thru when they are in the process of dying. By the 1960's technology had advanced enough that people were separated somewhat from the whole process of dying. Dying people were crated off to hospitals, and then shoved off in the corner. No one cared about them, or cared to understand what they were going thru. Dr. Kubler-Ross sat and talked to these patients, listened to what they had to say, and wrote about how these people felt. She identified what have become the generally accepted 5 stages of grieving that people go thru when they (or a close loved one) are dying. These stages (in order) are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Generally speaking, most people she talked to went thru these stages when they were dying. Don't get me wrong. Having a loved one with autism is  not  the same as having a loved one dying. But as with many major unexpected life changes, there are some similarities. I think it helps when dealing with other parents who have autistic kids to remember that they might still be working thru a similar process on the road to acceptance of their child. I think most parents go thru an analogous process to what Kubler-Ross described, before fairly quickly realizing that autism is not the same as a death sentence, and though their child's life will be different, it need not be an unfulfilled one. When I was in residency training, one of the things that I considered going into was Pain Management. Pain Management is a very interesting field, and it can be very fulfilling. But after spending a few months in the pain clinics, I knew that this field was not for me. The first thing I learned in the pain clinics was that no one got better if there was any potential financial gain to be had from staying \"ill\". Trying to cure a person's pain while they had a disability claim pending, or a lawsuit pending was not difficult-it was impossible. Once the money claims were settled, then working on the pain was possible, but seemed to proceed slower than if there had been no potential secondary financial gain out there to begin with. It seemed as if the delaying of initiating the healing process got them somehow \"stuck\" in a cycle of pain, from which it was a lot harder to dig themselves out of. I just didn't have the patience to wait until all the patients' outside issues were dealt with. I see a similar process occur when someone is involved in a lawsuit (say, over someone dying by being hit by a drunk driver). The lawsuit, which generally drags on over a couple of years, serves as a prolonged period of grief for those who lost the person in the accident. They remain angry for so long that at the end there is little of the relief that they expected. So how do these two things relate to autism? I am not a big fan of drug companies.  But I think that one thing that has happened is that those who are pursuing \"Big Pharma\" for financial compensation get \"stuck\" and don't get to the stage where they accept their autistic child. They cannot keep up the intense anger at the vaccine makers without also being angry at the autism they caused. They gather others around them, who even if they aren't directly involved, still feed this cycle of \"hate the autism\", which keeps them from accepting their child. You don't see such things in the Down's Syndrome community. They have no external entity to blame, so there are not large groups dedicated to blaming big bad outside forces and conspiracies for their child. They are thus free to work thru their disappointment over lost possibilities, and on to acceptance of their child.  Perhaps, one day when all of the conspiracy theories are finally laid to rest, we can  all  get on with our lives, help those with autism in our families develop to their fullest potential, and help society to see them as full, valid members of society. Or, perhaps we will always have a large percentage of the autism community tilting at windmills, and prolonging the process of moving toward acceptance for many.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RhKy_G3b-WI/AAAAAAAAAIY/isN_QqC7jF0/s1600-h/scales-justice-cindytoo.jpg", "http://flickr.com/photos/shebalso/108279806/", "http://www.elisabethkublerross.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Death-Dying-Elisabeth-Kubler-Ross/dp/0684839385"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/04/death-and-dying-justice-and-autism.html", "title": "\nDeath and Dying, Justice, and Autism\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 3, 2007", "body": "\nWell, at least I was this morning when I went to vote.  It's hard for me to predict that I'll get out on time at the end of the day, so I always try to vote at the beginning.  But I have to get there early, otherwise I don't get to work on time. So I was in line at 0530 this morning, and was the first one to vote.  The only thing of import on the ballot was a funding initiative for the school district.  The rest of the ballot were unopposed local officials standing for re-election. Public school enrollment continues to swell in our district, and all of the primary and middle schools are going to have auxiliary classrooms in trailers next year.  The new initiative would remodel the schools, and add some space.  I hope it passes. I was glad to get out of the polling place this morning.  We vote in our local grammar school, which is the place that Buddy Boy went to school last year.  The place that was conspiring to expel him (we withdrew him for homebound school before they were able to do this), and the place where they wanted him shipped to a separate school for emotionally disturbed kids.  My stomach roils whenever I go in that building.  I was waiting to vote outside the room where we used to have our IEP's.  I know I should forgive and forget (or at least try to forget and move on), but it's difficult sometimes. Perhaps it's worse because of some of the forms we were filling out for Sweet Pea last night.  Sweet Pea will be starting Kindergarten next year.  We got permission from the school district for her to attend the same school as Buddy Boy next year (it's in the same district, but is not our assigned school).  This will make it much easier logistically for Liz for getting them to and from school, and  much easier for both of us to be active in the Parent Teacher Organization. One of the forms we had to sign said something like (and I paraphrase from memory) \"I affirm that this child has never been expelled from school due to disciplinary action for the use or possession of drugs, dangerous weapons, or assault on another person\".  This is a form that we will have to be attest to each year for the next 12 years.  If the school district had been successful last year in expelling Buddy Boy for his tantrums (throwing staplers, half hearted kicking at them) in Kindergarten, we would have had that following him throughout the next 12 years.  The fact that the school district would do that to an autistic 5 year old kid who was having control issues that were part and parcel of his disability (as well as the fact that they were, IMO, purposely provoking him) really gets my goat.  I touch on some of our dealings with the school district  here ,  here , and  here . How dare they do that to my child, or any child for that matter.  I know that they justify their actions because they have to \"serve all the kids, not just the special needs ones\", and \"we have to have a single standard of punishment for everyone\".  Irrespective of the fact that both of those attitudes are addressed in the law, which states that disabilities are to be taken into account, and that if a student's actions are a part of their disability they are not to be disciplined for it, these kind of things happen all the time.  I only hope that there is some kind of cosmic retribution waiting for those who would conspire to crush a child's spirit, and deny him an education and chance at success in life.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/04/im-number-1.html", "title": "\nI'm Number 1!\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 2, 2007", "body": "\n If you've followed my musings lately, you know that I am not a big fan of chelation.  It changes your body chemistry radically, and is possibly deadly.  So they'll be none of that around Club 166's house. But to be honest, I must admit that there are a lot of environmental pollutants out there, and no one has discounted the role that the environment may play in autism.  So I've come up with a way to gradually release these toxins from Buddy Boy's body without doing him harm.  I'm sure that some readers will be a little surprised to see that I am espousing what could be called an \"alternative treatment\".  But as this treatment is all natural, and when used properly is totally safe, I think it's important to try it. If reverse osmosis works to leach metals and other toxins out of water, then why can't it work on Buddy Boy?  I've started him on an all natural daily supplement of dehydrated water, which has had all of the toxins removed from it.  Since this product is all natural and toxin free, as it passes thru the gut (which is a natural semi-permeable membrane) it will create a diffusion gradient for toxins to diffuse thru the gut wall and into the lumen of the intestines, where they will be eliminated naturally.   Tap water in most locales is fairly contaminated nowadays, and contains all sorts of minerals in it, which will reduce the diffusion gradient for toxins to be eliminated.  This is why I use the much purer product, dehydrated water, which has been triple purified before undergoing the dehydration process.  It is important to note that it is essential to use distilled water to reconstitute the dehydrated water before administration.  Failure to do so will decrease the effectiveness of treatment. Now the real beauty of this treatment is that since it is an aqueous based treatment, it will work both in the gut as well as in the kidneys, which are our bodies natural mechanisms to eliminate wastes.  By providing the kidneys with this waste free/toxin free substrate, the kidneys' actions are enhanced, and toxins flow out of the body rather than into it. Now there is a small potential danger with this treatment, and that is if we get too overzealous we can actually cause water intoxication, which although rare, can be serious.  So it's important to just substitute the dehydrated water for the normal amount of water that Buddy Boy drinks each day, and not to push too hard, too fast.  This means that his detoxification might take a little longer, but it will certainly be totally safe.  I expect that by the time Buddy Boy is in high school he will have all the toxins leached from his system with this approach, and he will be a new kid.

{"date": "Friday, March 30, 2007", "body": "\n Photo credit-Bob Reck In a  story out of North Carolina  that will sound familiar to all who have lived in suburban America, a local homeowner's association has forbidden an owner to put up a 6 foot fence (which is prohibited under their covenant). What's unusual (probably not to most reading this list, but in general) is that the reason the homeowners wanted to put up a higher than allowed fence was to keep their young autistic son from eloping from their yard. This is one of those common problems that we often have to face.  In our family, we decided to put dead bolt locks on all of our outside doors (as well as our mudroom door) in order to keep Buddy Boy from eloping when he was younger.  This is against our local building code, and if the city catches us, we'll likely be forced to remove them (our local code says that there must be a latch on the inside that can release the lock).  While we appreciate that we put ourselves at slightly increased risk of not being able to get out of the house if there is a fire, for us the overwhelming problem was of having our son run out of the house, which unfortunately sits on a relatively busy street.  We compensate for the fire scenario by having keys placed up high near the doors. In the incident in the article: ...Michele and Rene Guyader hoped to build a 6-foot fence to keep their fast-growing boy from falling into a sewage drain hole at the back of their steeply sloping lot. The homeowners association of their Clayton subdivision turned them down. ... One would think that your neighbors would execute some common sense and sensibility, but unfortunately this is usually in short supply in these local situations.  Some of the biggest tyrants are to be found in positions of power in these local homeowners associations. The homeowners association was asked by a reporter to respond: Bailey, the architectural review committee member in the Guyaders' neighborhood, said he was not fully aware of the son's condition until contacted by a reporter. He would consider a 4-foot-tall fence, topped with a see-through lattice. The Guyaders aren't sure yet that will work. They argue an exception to the covenant is warranted because they didn't know of their son's condition before moving into Cobblestone subdivision about a year ago. I know Buddy Boy would make short work of a \"see through lattice\" if he really wanted to get over a fence. \"A man's home is his castle\" is the old saying.  Nowadays, that holds true only if the government doesn't have a tax lien on the house, you've complied with all local building codes, and the increasingly ominous homeowners covenants, which can dictate all sorts of things which you can and can't do to your house, including what color you can paint it.  I've never lived in a place where I had to sign one of these things, and I hope to never have to. I also hope that there will come a time when common sense prevails, and people can make common sense modifications to  their own house  when they need to for the safety of one of the occoupants.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RgyKgm3b-PI/AAAAAAAAAHY/okc0rAUji-Q/s1600-h/Fence-Bob+Reck.jpg", "http://www.newsobserver.com/152/story/558309.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/03/heights-we-go-to.html", "title": "\nThe Heights We Go To\n"},

I like to keep my mind open to different opinions, and different ways of doing things.  But sometimes you have to draw a line in the sand. Twenty years ago, the gay community was beseiged by a disease that was killing them off, and no one seemed to care.  Several people in the gay community in New York came up with the \"Silence=Death\" campaign.  It was a simple campaign to raise awareness amongst all of society of what was happening.  They didn't have the internet, so they plastered posters all over town looking much like the one above. I believe that the autism community is under a somewhat similar (though not yet as devastating) onslaught in this day and age.  There are two main things that I see that are killing autistics.  One is the physical and psychological abuse that is going on in institutions (and sometimes openly in society).  The other is subjecting autistics to experimental treatments that have no scientific proof, and have killed people that were being treated.  The biggest offender in this category is chelation (now sometimes referred to as \"detoxification\"). While I still respect any parent that respects and loves their child and is just trying to get the  best interventions for them, I can no longer stay silent when they mention chelation as a possible option as treatment.  Sometimes in the past I have not been as vocal as I should have been in informing them of the hazards of chelation.  At the risk of losing friends, and of getting tossed off one local message board I am on, I can stay silent no longer. Description of deaths from chelation can be found  here  and  here .  A good discussion of a 5 year old autistic child's death from chelation can be found on Kevin Leitch's blog  here . We have this great disseminator of information, the internet.

{"date": "Thursday, March 29, 2007", "body": "\n Today we celebrated Sweet Pea's 5th birthday. She's been looking forward to this for weeks. We've been counting down the days. My daughter has enough exuberance for the whole family. She gets excited over the most ordinary things. So when things out of the ordinary happen, she's over the top. Yesterday she says \"Tomorrow's my birthday, everybody's going to be there, and I'll get to have CAKE! and ICE CREAM!, and PRESENTS!!!\" I didn't think she'd ever get to sleep last night. Rather than have a large kids party, we went with a fairly sedate celebration with just family (immediate family, aunt, uncle, and one great aunt). She wasn't sure what kind of theme she wanted for her party, but just said \"Just so it's not BOY stuff.\" So we went with butterflies and flowers (all over the walls, with some butterflies hanging from threads from the ceiling), with a sun hanging from the light above the dining room table. During the day today Liz did Sweet Pea's nails. Sweet Pea has been wanting to have nail polish for some time now, and Liz said she couldn't have it until she was 5. It was the first thing Sweet Pea showed me when I got home. \"Look, daddy!\" \"It's pink, my favorite color!\" \"First we put on the polish, then we put on some oil, then we had to let it sit for a loooong time.\" We had salad and pizza for dinner, then the required cake, ice cream, and presents. Sweet Pea had a great time. Buddy Boy had picked out a birthday card for her (with her favorite on it-Disney princesses). He can be very thoughtful, and does know what his sister likes. Buddy Boy likes to talk (about things HE likes to talk about). He goes to social skills classes, which we think are helping him in responding appropriately to others, as well as getting his needs across.  We're sitting at the dinner table talking about my sister's dogs. Sweet Pea asks if they are females (they both are), and expresses the wish that they'll have puppies. I try to placate Sweet Pea by saying that they won't have puppies because they're both female dogs, and you need a daddy dog and a mommy dog to make babies. My sister decides to tell her that they both had operations so that they wouldn't have any babies (more information than I would have given, but oh, well). Buddy Boy jumps in with \"So they won't have any puppies, Sweet Pea. And speaking of Magma, did you know that it isn't called magma once it's out of the volcano. Then it's lava. And there are 3 different types of volcanoes. You'd know this if you watched my videos, dad. There are cinder cones, composite volcanoes, and shield volcanoes... .\" He then went on for about 3 minutes straight talking about volcanoes, the Pacific \"ring of fire\" where many volcanoes are located, how you can't always tell that a volcano is really dormant, etc. before we finally cut him off.  My wife's aunt (84 years young) loved it. I think she was about to pee her pants. All of us found it fairly amusing. I admired the way Buddy Boy was able to spot a brief lull in the conversation, say something related, and steer the conversation (even if a bit crudely) to a topic he wanted to talk about. It's good to know he's getting our money's worth out of those social skills classes. So all in all it was a great day. Sweet Pea had a good time, Buddy Boy was able to cope well for most of the party (though he and Sweet Pea did argue a bit about a doll she got with blond hair-he does  like blonds , after all).  And I didn't have to get into a long description of getting a dog spayed, and why, and answer questions about people getting spayed, etc.   And in checking on the net before I posted, I found out that geologists generally agree that there are  4  different types  of volcanoes (how could Buddy Boy have forgotten Lava Domes?).  I can't wait to tell him in the morning.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 27, 2007", "body": "\n photo credits-my cell phone during my bike ride What a great weekend it was in the middle of the US.  Sure, there were some showers, but it was warm, occasionally sunny, and flowers and trees are blooming all over the place. A great time for playing outdoors.  We practiced throwing a baseball and long jumping (events that Buddy Boy's class will participate in in Special Olympics), and I got out on the bike myself, as well as with the kids. When I went out with the kids, we did something new.  Sweet Pea has outgrown the trailer I used to pull her in, so she has graduated to the \"tag along\" bike that hooks up to my seatpost.  She says \"I don't get enough air in the trailer\".  Of course what she really means is \"Now that I've gotten a taste of riding out in the elements like this, like a big girl, you're never going to stuff me back in that trailer again!\"  Fortunately, Buddy Boy has gotten more confident on riding his two wheeler without the training wheels. So we did a new thing yesterday.  Instead of me throwing their two bikes in the car, takeing them to the park, then having them ride while I walked, we all rode to the park.  I hooked the tag along bike to mine, and rode in the street pulling Sweet Pea behind me while Buddy Boy rode on the sidewalk the half mile to the park, where we rode on the trail that circles the park.  This was significant, as Buddy Boy has never ridden on anything as narrow as the sidewalk before.  I thought he was up to it, and he was the one who suggested we do it this way (I think he gets tired of waiting for me to catch up to them walking while they ride).  Buddy Boy did pretty well.  He veered off into the grass once on the way there, and bumped into two obstacles (a fence post and a telephone pole) on the way back. Because it was the end of the ride (and we had also spent a good deal of free time on the playground equipment) Buddy Boy decompensated a bit when he bumped the obstacles.  But he managed to get it back together in a few minutes, and we carried on back home. It was great to get out and celebrate the start of a new season.  Spring always feels so fresh and new, and the color that is dappled all over the place by nature is simply spectacular. Happy Spring, everyone!

{"date": "Sunday, March 25, 2007", "body": "\n One of the blogs that I like to visit periodically is by a pediatrician, who goes by the name of  \"Dr. Flea\".   Flea covers a lot of territory with his posts, and has had multiple posts that are supportive of the autism community and dismissive of the anti-vaccine crowd.   In perusing his blog recently, I noted a most unusual post.  If ever one doubted that there are some serious nutjobs out there promoting the whole \"mercury causes autism\" thing,  Dr. Rebecca Carley  is proof of how \"out there\" some of these people can be.  The photo above is from her web site. Looking at her rambling, single spaced website, Carley goes on about how vaccines cause autism, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and shaken baby syndrome.  She lists a phone number that you can call to get advice on how to reverse your disease with natural remedies.  As she states: ...DR CARLEY HAS CLIENTS (BOTH PEOPLE AND PETS) ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND DOES NOT NEED TO SEE YOU IN PERSON!  YOUR PROTOCOL TEACHING YOU HOW TO REVERSE YOUR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE OR CANCER IS CREATED BASED ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL HISTORY. ... It's great that you don't even have to have an office visit to get diagnosed and treated by this quack. Fortunately for society, and as Flea notes, her license to practice medicine was  revoked in 2004 .   A review of her website and hearing proceedings of the medical board reveal that she has had serious problems for years. Looking at  her CV , she completed 4 years (out of a usual 5) of a general surgery residency.  This is usually a red flag that something was noticed to be wrong by her program.  She was accepted into a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation residency program, but washed out of that in two months.  She subsequently practiced as an emergency room physician for a few years, and one year as a surgical house officer.  The CV notes nothing for several years, then notes that she took multiple \"Alternative Medicine\" courses and seminars over 2 years.  She subsequently claims to have started a new medical specialty,   VIDS (Vaccine Induced Diseas Syndromes, which includes all autoimmune diseases and cancers) . There was a psychiatric evaluation done as part of the proceedings which ended in her losing her license.  The psychiatrist found Crawley to have: ... a delusional disorder with the presence of narcissistic and borderline personality traits.  ... He also testified: ...she has persecutions of persecution and grandiosity and that she believes that she is being persecuted because she is special. ... And if that isn't enough: ... Dr. Labins also testified that the Respondent (Dr. Carley)believes that her husband sodomized their son as part of a satanic ritual because she does not vaccinate and because she cures children with autism. ... So if you ever wondered who was out there promoting vaccines as being evil, and mercury as causing autism, here is one prime example. Unfortunately it's  usually  not the out and out loonies that sucker people in, but some of their psychologically slightly better balanced followers who do the most damage.

{"date": "Saturday, March 24, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit-  leappbaby In a  troubling incident  in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a mother is accusing the school system of child abuse for \"rolling up\" her 7 year old autistic son when he was out of control.  This incident is troubling for a couple of reasons.  First, most likely this is an all too common scenario of untrained staff overreacting in an inappropriate manner.   ...The mom told police the boy's face, neck and shoulders were covered with marks that appeared to be tiny broken blood vessels under his skin. We talked to the doctor who saw the boy that day. He said the injuries were likely from screaming while being in a tight restraint for a long time. ... This description is consistent with the child having force applied to him (squeezed tightly) while he was \"rolled up\".  It was fortunate that asphyxiation injury did not occur, which could have caused brain damage or death.  Although the injuries in this case were certainly uncalled for and serious, they didn't warrant any medical attention, and the child has returned to school.  The parent may be absolutely correct in pursuing legal redress, but this case is also troubling in that stories like this only serve to paint all autistic kids as wild, violent, and out of control, which makes it easier to dehumanize them and leads to societal acceptance of further abuse. I certainly sympathize with the mother.  About 18 months ago I had a similar incident occur with Buddy Boy. Although he did not end up with  petechiae, and it wasn't a part of his Positive Behavioral Support Plan, staff at the school wrapped him in a heavy rug while he was screaming at them that he didn't want to be wrapped up.  Deep pressure only works if it's what the person is seeking to calm themself, not if they're just pissed off about some innane thing that you're doing to them. But I hate to see these things made into police matters.  I'm worried that the next time the child is perceived to be \"out of control\" that the school calls the police, who will treat the child as a criminal and taser them (or worse).  I'd much rather the school district act responsibly and realize that this technique was absolutely wrong (and could have resulted in worse injury or death), apologize (I can dream), immediately have an IEP meeting to determine whether the Positive Behavioral Support Plan that was in place was followed, and whether that plan needs to be revised. The school district has already lined up  another parent  of an autistic child to defend their practice.  So even if the original child's Positive Behavioral Support Plan wasn't followed, and even if the district overstepped their bounds, this case is lost in the forum of public opinion, and the biggest losers are all autistics, who are further viewed as violent, out of control, subhuman creatures.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 21, 2007", "body": "\nIn the movies, reunions are usually all good. The music builds, knowing glances are exchanged, and it all works out neat and clean. Seldom are things quite so clear cut in real life. Our kids' birthmother, Kelly, is basically a good person who doesn't always make good decisions. She's had 3 kids with three different men, none of whom ever stuck around. She is raising the oldest one, Jeffrey, who is now 10 years old. The other two, Buddy Boy, 7, and Sweet Pea, 5, are our kids. She doesn't smoke, drink, or do drugs. Kelly has worked fairly menial jobs in her past, but is now on partial disability following an on the job injury to her hand a couple of years ago. Other than a scar following a surgery, the hand appears grossly to work fairly well to me. She works 20 hours/week in a retail setting.  Yesterday afternoon we arrived in Kelly's city and drove out to her apartment to see her. She keeps a neat apartment. When I walk in one of the things I notice is a bookcase packed floor to ceiling with several hundred movie DVD's in it. The kids notice her cat, and take off after it. I try to at least get them to be a little more gentle with the cat. Sweet Pea is initially friendly, but when Jeffrey comes home from school and Kelly's mom, Neenah, comes over she very uncharacteristically gets very reserved and retreats to the back bedroom and refuses to come out. Sweet Pea is destined for things like class president, she's so social. I've never seen her this way. I follow her back to the room and attempt to reassure her and hold her. After a while she comes out, but is still very reluctant to be very interactive. A while later she sits in Kelly's lap, and seems to loosen up some more. Kelly, for her part, is much more evenhanded with Buddy Boy this go around. She talks to him about school, and gives him a hug and kiss. She also talks about wanting to get out of her apartment, and wanting to buy a house. She mentions that the realtors wanted $1000 as a down payment, which she doesn't have. She wants to get a house that will have a payment the same as her monthly rent (~$400). We try to gently explain that she's in a relatively good situation now (bills getting paid, no debt), and that there are a lot of hidden costs of home ownership. She says that she wants a house so that she has something to leave Jeffrey. I relate to her how a relative of mine is about to be forced to declare bankruptcy and lose his house because he got in over his head. She still seems unconvinced. She says the neighbors are noisy, and she's tired of yelling at them. I glance again at the DVD's, which had to have cost at least $4-$5000, and say nothing. Kelly is pleased with Jeffrey's performance in school (mostly A's and B's, with one C) but didn't know when his spring break was when Liz called to arrange our getting together, and doesn't know which middle school he'll be going to if they stay in the same apartment. I think that many people that have adopted don't like to have contact with the birthparents just because it's uncomfortable for them. Adoption, by it's nature, often brings together people from different socioeconomic classes, with different value systems and different outlooks in general. As much as we in America pride ourselves on having an egalitarian society with no class system, most of us do not usually associate closely with members of society that are very different from ourself. Liz and I are committed to having our kids know their birthmother (she has no contact info for their birthfathers), even though it isn't always the most comfortable thing for us. I know that although our family finances are sometimes a bit strained, we look like Rockefellers to Kelly and her family. In making small talk Kelly mentions how Sweet Pea is fairly leggy, and she wouldn't expect her to be tall, as her daddy isn't. Autism isn't the only subculture that has \"language issues\". I bristle a bit at having her birthfather who's never laid eyes on her being referred to as \"her father\". After strapping on a \"Baby Bjorn\" with Sweet Pea every other night for the first 4 months of her life, walking the floor trying to comfort her, and catching cat naps with her still strapped to me in the Lazy Boy (until we finally got her esophageal reflux correctly diagnosed and treated), I think the term \"her Daddy\" belongs to me, and me alone. But I know she means no harm and is referring to the short (5'4\") stature of Sweet Pea's birthfather, and let it slide. I also know that in the eyes of the only one who really counts, I will always be \"Her Daddy\". We leave her place and all go back to our motel to take a swim in the pool. The pool isn't too big, but it doesn't matter as we have it to ourselves. Swimming is great at lubricating the rough spots for all of us, and we all seem to loosen up. Today was much easier all around. We did some touristy things during the day with the kids, then Kelly and Jeffrey came over after he got off school. We went swimming again. Sweet Pea is much more her gregarious self today. She is relaxed with Kelly, and hanging on Jeffrey. She seems determined to keep up with the boys in the pool, and lets them each take a hand and jump in all together. It's a Hallmark moment. Afterwards we all go out to eat for dinner. Buddy Boy now starts to decompensate, asking why we have to go home tomorrow, and lamenting that we haven't had enough time with \"Aunt Kelly\" and Jeffrey. The last two days have found him to be more interactive than either Liz or I have ever seen him with another boy. We think he likes the idea of having an older brother. At the restaurant Kelly's half sister drops by to meet the kids. Before she comes in Kelly volunteers that her sister wasn't when the kids were born because she was in prison. Her sister seems nice enough. I cringe at the mention of prison only because it is one of my innermost worst fears of possible futures for Buddy Boy. We all exchange hugs goodbye when we leave the restaurant. Buddy Boy basically holds it together, though it's obvious he's very emotional at leaving. I'm glad we came. It's really important to me that the kids have some sense of where they've come from. I think it will help them in the future, so I'm willing to endure whatever small discomfort we have to now. I'm also thankful, though, that there's 300 miles of freeway between us and their birthmother. Like with inlaws, sometimes a little space is good. Tomorrow, it's back on the road again. No more time tonight to find a nice picture for the header, or even to clean up my syntax.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/03/mostly-good-reunion.html", "title": "\nA (mostly good) Reunion\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 23, 2007", "body": "\n I've finally gotten through reading Roy Richard Grinker's  Unstrange Minds-Remapping the World of Autism .  I had picked it up earlier this month, when I also got to meet Grinker at a book signing.  He passed my  \"sniff test\"  when I met him, and I looked forward to reading the book. Having read a few other reviews, I didn't think I would be disappointed, and I wasn't.  The book is divided into two parts.  The first part is basically a short history of autism in western society, mostly in North America.  The second part explains how three other cultures (Korea, India, and Africa) view and treat autism, from an anthropologist's view (which Grinker is). Like most people directly affected by autism, I'm fairly well versed about \"all things autism\", and I didn't think that I would learn very much from the first part of the book.  But there were many things that I hadn't known that I found quite interesting.  Things such as J. Langdon Down (for whom Down's syndrome is named) also described atypical patients who he thought had mental retardation that sound very like autistic patients back in 1887.  Down was also the source of the comment that he thought these children were especially beautiful. Grinker comes from a long line of psychiatrists, as well as being married to one, and is thus well versed on how psychiatry and autism have evolved.  He weaves anecdotes and personal history of famous figures like Kanner into an intriguing description of how autism has always been with us, and how it has come to be recognized and systematized.  Probably the thing that draws most readers in is how Grinker uses examples from his own familiy's experience with autism into this book.  Grinker's daughter, Isabel, now 16, came of age during the leading edge of increasing awareness of autism.  Many of the battles that she and her family went thru, as well as many of her victories, will be very familiar to anyone whose life has been touched by autism. As bad as society sometimes views autism in America, things are often much worse in other parts of the world.  Grinker takes us on a world tour of select spots in the world where autistics are treated much worse that they are here.  Places where autistics are shunned and locked in cages, and places where there is little understanding, much less assistance, for autistics.  Amongst other feelings, it leaves one feeling lucky to have as much understanding and acceptance that we do have, though it is far from perfect. So I heartily recommend Unstrange Minds, both to readers who are a part of the autism community, as well as those that aren't.  It's a great read, and hard to put down.  Grinker personalizes autism thru his daughter, Isabel, while being thoroughly educational as to how autism has evolved both in western society as well as elsewhere.

{"date": "Monday, March 19, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit-Staci Peters Lately my two selves have been somewhat at odds with each other-my science educated self and my parent self. As a person trained in the scientific method and believing in things that I can test and measure, one of the first things I did when we got a diagnosis of autism for Buddy Boy was to immerse myself in reading as much research as I could get my hands on.  If there were things out there that were proven to help, then I would find them and get that help for him.   One of the first things I discovered was that there was a bunch of new age, hocus pocus kind of stuff out there that had absolutely no science behind it.  Sure, on an initial scan of some of the literature talking about causation and \"cures\" there were things that seemed to make some sense.  But when I looked with a critical eye, looking for hard data, there was just no \"there\" there for most of this stuff.   My reading did seem to indicate that we had \"missed the boat\" by not instituting ABA therapy before the age of three (Buddy Boy was almost 4 when doctors stopped talking about sensory integration disorder, probable ADHD, and language delay and finally uttered the \"A word\").  I read up on ABA therapy anyway, and quickly realized that classic ABA therapy consisted of basically putting my kid into a Skinner Box, which I wasn't really too fond of (note: I know that all \"ABA\" isn't created equal, so don't all pounce on me if it's working for you). The parent side of me has always wanted to protect my son, nurture him, instill a love of learning and an ethical base, then turn him loose on the world to do great things (what I'm sure we all want, basically).  Upon getting a diagnosis, and as Buddy Boy's OCD behaviors and touchy temperment became more evident, the parent in me has wanted to put emphasis on getting the best supports educationally and socially that I can for my son, so that he has the best chance of living independently and being a productive member of society. I have thus become much less enamored with research, especially into causation.  Forget population statistics, genetics, and the environment.  I have an \"n\" of 1 to take care of.  If something isn't directly helpful to us in caring of our son, then it's a lot less interesting to me.  Sure, I still follow all types of research when I come across it, but following most research has become a side issue rather than the main event. So it was with some interest that I read  this announcement  from researchers at Georgetown University.  Using advanced brain imaging techniques, researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center have watched how humans use both lower and higher brain processes to learn novel tasks, an advance they say may help speed up the teaching of new skills as well as offer strategies to retrain people with perceptual deficits due to autism. ... Rather than being aimed at isolating 100's of genes that contribute to autism (important stuff, just not too helpful in the here and now for me), they looked at something that  is  going to be important to Buddy Boy for the rest of his life, learning. ...In the March 15 issue of Neuron, the research team provides the first human evidence for a two-stage model of how a person learns to place objects into categories discerning, for example, that a green apple, and not a green tennis ball, belongs to \"food.\" They describe it as a complex interplay between neurons that process stimulus shape (\"bottom-up\") and more sophisticated brain areas that discriminate between these shapes to categorize and \"label\" that information (\"top-down\"). ... I've always thought that Buddy Boy's inability to remember the names of any of his classmates (with a couple of  notable exceptions ) was at least partly due to the way his brain filed away peoples' faces.  If these researchers can shed some light on how we file away things in our memory, then concrete methods at assisting those with trouble with these pathways could be designed. These kinds of studies are, to me, the kinds of studies that will shed some light on what specific kinds of supports are the most helpful in preparing my son to live independently.  And that's a great thing, no matter how you slice it.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 20, 2007", "body": "\n photo credit Ed Wilson We can never know about the days to come But we think about them anyway And I wonder if I'm really with you now Or just chasing after some finer day. ... Anticipation-Carly Simon There was a lot of anticipation in the Club 166 family today.  It's been three years since we've visited the kids' birthmother.  Buddy Boy hasn't expressed much of an opinion one way or the other on the trip lately.  Until last night, when he said he was going to give \"Aunt Kelly\" (what we call his birthmother) all of his money so that she could buy a house.  Because she was poor and lived in an apartment, so we could buy her a house, or he would just give her money so she could.   \"Um, Buddy Boy, that's very generous of you, but I think that you would really hurt her feelings if you did that.  Also, just because somebody lives in an apartment doesn't mean they are poor.  Mom and I have lived in lots of apartments.  So don't say anything about her being poor, and I bet she'd really like it if you gave her and Jeffrey (their 10 year old biological half brother that Kelly is raising) a lot of smiles.\" Liz and I have always pursued an \"honesty is the best policy\" when it comes to talking to the kids regarding their adoption history.  Adoption has always been a part of our lexicon, and their birth and adoption stories have also often been discusssed.  We've told them that their birthmother loved them, but was not going to be able to take care of them when they were born, and thus made an adoption plan for them, and selected us to be their parents.   We've never used the word poor to refer to her, but somehow Buddy Boy has inferred that because she wasn't going to be able to take care of him or Sweet Pea before, and she still lives in an apartment, then she must be poor. Liz and I were a little anxious about the trip.  When we adopted Buddy Boy we agreed to what's called a \"semi-open\" adoption.  That's where the new parents agree to a specified number of pictures/updates over a certain period of time.  Our relationship with the kids' birthmother (they both have the same birthmother) has morphed into an open one, with cards, pictures, and letters exchanged on holidays/birthdays, and the one previous trip that we took 3 years ago for a visit (in addition to the time we spent together the 2 times we adopted the kids).  When we visited 3 years ago it was obvious to us that Kelly payed a lot of attention to Sweet Pea, and not much attention at all to Buddy Boy (after contacting us and asking us if we wanted to adopt Sweet Pea when she was born, Kelly almost changed her mind in the days following her birth, because 'She had always wanted a girl').  We didn't want a repeat episode of Buddy Boy getting the short end of the stick. Sweet Pea, for her part, has been counting down the days until we visited \"Aunt Kelly\".  She has pictures from the last trip in a photo album on a shelf in her room, but she doesn't really remember the last trip (she was just shy of two years old).  Last night, however, she seemed to be having second thoughts.  \"I don't want to go tomorrow, Daddy.  It's going to take too long in the car, my legs will get stiff, and it's not going to be any fun.\" \"But don't you want to go see \"Aunt Kelly\" and Jeffrey?  They both love you very much, and I know that they want to see you.\"  [Sweet Pea gives me a sidelong long turned half away from me-I'm not quite sure how to interpret this]  \"Get some good sleep, sweety pie.  It's a long trip, but remember there's a swimming pool at the motel.  We'll all go swimming when we're there.  It'll be fun.\" (Reminding her about the swimming pool is a cheap ploy, but I knew it would work.  Both kids are suckers for swimming pools.  In fact, I think they'd be just as happy for our annual vacation if we stayed in our home town and checked into a motel with a swimming pool). The trip itself was fairly uneventful.  Buddy Boy is a good traveler (riding in the car was always something that soothed him as a child).  Riding in the car with both Buddy Boy and Sweet Pea for 5 hours brings the usual sibling squabbles one would expect between kids that are 7 and almost 5.  We strategically put the laptop briefcase between them on the backseat as a  pseudo barrier, but of course they're big enough to reach over it and poke the other one when they really want to (which is fairly often).   About half way there, Buddy Boy asked me what the red button on the dash was for (the emergency flasher button).  I of course told both kids that if I pushed it, anyone in the back seat was ejected from the car (I've never claimed to be the perfect father).  Buddy Boy immediately countered \"You can't do that!  It's against the law!

{"date": "Thursday, March 15, 2007", "body": "\n One thing that has always been a part of Buddy Boy\u2019s makeup is that he hardly appears to be paying attention to his peers.  While he likes adults, knows his teachers\u2019 names, and can relate things that adults in his life did that day, he does not appear to care about kids his age.  He doesn\u2019t much like to play with other kids and rarely talks to them.  When he comes home from school, he can relate no things he did with any other children, and even after being in the same class with the same kids for two years, could not name any other kids in the class.  There is one notable exception to this rule. My kid digs blond chicks. This is the only conclusion I can come to, after considering the following: When in pre-school, there was one girl whose name he knew, and that teachers mentioned he would (sometimes) talk to.  It was a girl named Trudy, who happened to be blond. When in Kindergarten, there was only one classmate that Buddy Boy ever was able to recall, Anna, who was blond.  She often tried to look after Buddy Boy and include him with class activities, even though he rarely responded. Finally, when Liz was taking him to a gym class the other day (run by a local OT who is great at getting Buddy Boy to participate), he indicates this girl in the class who is probably 9 years old (and blond) and tells Liz \u201cThat\u2019s my love.\u201d  I guess it was all Liz could do to keep herself from cracking up at that point.  Here was her son, who hardly ever interacts in any way we recognize with other kids, declaring his love for a girl he doesn\u2019t know (by his own admission, she has only ever asked him \u201cCould you go stand somewhere else?\u201d). I\u2019m not sure where this \u201cblond thing\u201d comes from.  Liz isn\u2019t blond.  None of the females in our families are blond.  Buddy Boy\u2019s birthmother isn\u2019t blond.  Did he have a good experience with Trudy in pre-school, and is now transferring what he feels is her essence (her being blond) to other kids?  Is it some innate thing that is expressing itself?  Has he internalized this from watching TV?   I am not sure where this has come from, but I wish I understood it, as it seems a powerful force.   I'd love to harness that force, just as long as it doesn't involve  Barbie  or  Paris Hilton .

{"date": "Friday, March 16, 2007", "body": "\n Well, we just got home from our parent-teacher conference for Buddy Boy.  Although we haven't gotten any really bad feedback from his teacher this year, we were apprehensive going into this. All in all, I have to say it went OK.  My radar shields have been up this year, having been burned badly  last year , I'm continually looking for hidden agendas and landmines waiting to explode.  But we sat and conversed with Buddy Boy's teacher for an hour, and things went OK.  Not perfect, but not bad. We probably spent 80% of the time going over academics, 15% of the time talking about socialization, and only 5% talking about \"behaviors\".  His teacher, Miss W., was generally upbeat, and mentioned several times how she loves Buddy Boy's love of learning.  She also mentioned a fair amount of times how he loves to go on and on about any subject they talk about, telling all that he knows about the subject.  I wanted to say \"Duh, he's autistic.  What do you expect?\".  But as she seems generally interested in him doing well, and generally and genuinely working towards helping him learn, I let it slide.  I'll save any snide comments for his next IEP. Miss W. spent a lot of time going over something called a  Woodcock Reading Mastery Test  that she had done with him.  She mentioned that it usually takes her about an hour and a half to administer the test, but with Buddy Boy it took her a week and a half to get thru it, due to him repeatedly getting sidetracked. While Buddy Boy scored high on word identification and comprehension (4th and 5th grade level), he was about at grade level (1st grade, 6 months) when it came to passage comprehension.  We know he's a very good reader (though he stops and starts, and gets distracted and goes off on tangents when reading passages), but it's nice to see it confirmed that this is so.  He's much better at \"listing\" all of the things that happened in a story, and not as good at summarizing and telling you what the story was about. Buddy Boy's math skills are average.   He's pretty much on par with what's expected from first graders.  His penmanship sucks (I actually thought it looked at least as readable as most doctors' :)).  The most encouraging thing is that his teacher mentioned she was going to let him use keyboarding more, as he has been practicing using a keyboard, while still having his OT work on the penmanship.  I found this very encouraging, as we didn't have to suggest this. There was some talk regarding his interupting class to keep on talking, and his being unfocused at times, but Miss W. didn't spend an inordinate amount of time talking about these things, and didn't seem to indicate that these were insurmountable problems, just things that we need to work on. She also indicated plans for greater inclusion in regular classes this year, including computer class and music class.  Also, depending on how he does in these two classes, a reading comprehension class.  Miss W. also thought it would be appropriate to have an IEP meeting in May, once we see how Buddy Boy does with a bit more inclusion, to talk about plans for next year. Miss W. mentioned that Buddy Boy actually went up to another boy in the class before recess and asked him if he wanted to play at recess.  That was huge.  He's never initiated something like that before, that I'm aware of.   He's asked his sister to play, he's responded occasionally to other kids initiations, but I've never seen him go up to any other kids and ask them to play (maybe those social skills classes he goes to are working, who knows?). So, all in all, it was a decent night.  No hidden agendas detected.  And Miss W. spent more time with us than I expected.  If things keep up this way, we might even begin to trust the school district a little. It's Spring Break next week, and I'm off work.  We're taking 3 days with the kids to go visit their birthmother and their older half brother(who live about 300 miles away).  Besides the birth of the two kids, we visited them one additional time about 2 years ago.  Sweet Pea doesn't really remember this, so this will be a new experience for her.  I'm sure the visit will be good for at least one blog entry.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 14, 2007", "body": "\n Of all the ways we've tried to transition Buddy Boy from one task to another, the one that has consistently worked is the simple statement that we need to stop doing \"x\", and now we will be doing \"y\", then counting backwards from 5. Buddy Boy gets absorbed in activities, and transitions have always been hard on us all.  His reactions are not nearly as severe as they used to be, but moving from one activitiy to another is still quite challenging. We've tried (and still do) give 5 minute/3 minute/1 minute warnings.  We've given choices for activities.  We've tried  premacking .  Written schedules, clocks, positive reinforcement.  Verbal explanation of  the 5 w's  , negotiation, and even just saying \"We're going to do this now.  Let's go.\"  All of the above methods (and others I may have forgotten to mention) have been tried, and all have worked at various times to one extant or another.  But none works as predictably as the counting down method. I've tried to get away from it (it seems a bit mechanical and childish to be using with a 7 year old), but Buddy Boy doesn't seem to disengage as easily from one thing to start another without this prompt.   I wonder what exactly there is about \"doing the count\" that gets him to go with the flow.  Is it the finality of it?  I mean, it's not as if there are any dire consequences if he fails to comply.  And when there are announced consequences, this method still works better than all others.   The method even works fairly well if I just use my fingers to count backwards, as I'll sometimes do rather than shouting out a countdown across a playground.  So it's not the tone of  my voice. Perhaps it's the simplicity of it.  Perhaps Buddy Boy interprets everything else as being open to negotiation (he  loves  to negotiate-which is usually viewed by us as a good thing), but he receives the countdown as singling the end of all negotiation and time to move on.  I don't know. We still try to use other methods (I like to give my kids as much autonomy as possible, and this method is just pure directive), but it's good to know that we have something that  does  work reliably.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RfdtaRfmY3I/AAAAAAAAAFE/4c6mIP65HFs/s1600-h/rocket.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premack_principle", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/03/5-4-3-2-1.html", "title": "\n5-4-3-2-1\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 12, 2007", "body": "\n Sweet Pea will turn 5 this month.  She's just a little over 2 years younger than Buddy Boy.  She's always been a typical younger sister.  Pretty much equal parts adoring, competitive, and annoying to her older brother.  She is outgoing, charming, willful, has a smile that lights up a room, and gets excited and happy about ordinary things. Because Buddy Boy gets up earlier than Sweet Pea, she goes to bed approximately 30 minutes later than he does.  Our routine is that for that last 30 minutes at least 20 minutes is spent reading to her. Lately Sweet Pea has been somewhat fixated on us reading \" An American Tail, an illustrated story \" for her bedtime reading.  This is a big departure from her usual desired fair- children's animal fables, collections of short children's stories, and her all time favorites, Disney princess stories.   An American Tail  is a fairly long (63 pages) and fairly wordy book for a soon to be 5 year old.  It's long enough that we have to break the book up over at least 3-4 nights to finish it.  The book tells the story of a Russian mouse emigrant in the 1880's who is washed overboard on the voyage to America, and is separated from his family.  He makes it to America in a bottle, and the rest of the story is a series of adventures in New York City while he searches for, and is eventually reunited with, his family. Both Buddy Boy and Sweet Pea are adopted.  Although we have pictures of their birth parents up in their rooms, occasionally send or get a card from her birthmother, and visited their birthmother once about a year and a half ago, Buddy Boy hasn't expressed more than a passing interest in his being adopted.  It's harder to tell with Sweet Pea.  She talks about her birthmother more, but it may be because Sweet Pea is more interested in the whole pregnancy/birthing process right now.  When Sweet Pea mentions that she wants to have a baby, we start our mantra- \"First you have to go to college, then you have to get a job.  Then you can send your parents to Hawaii. :)  Then you can get married if you want to, and  then  you can have a baby\". I've been wondering if Sweet Pea's interest in  An American Tail  is rooted in a vague feeling of abandonement because of adoption.  My reading tells me that kids this age wonder what they may have done to make their birthmother not love them or want them.  I also wonder if she feels the burden yet of being \"different\" from her peers in pre-school, because of her having been adopted.  We talk about her adoption story, and reassure her that she had nothing to do with the circumstances that led up to her being  placed for adoption.  We also reassure her that we will always be there for her, and that we will love her always. But I sometimes worry, with all the energy that is taken up with dealing with Buddy Boy's autism, are we missing obvious signs of things Sweet Pea needs from us?  I guess all we can do is try to pay attention, and keep on loving them both, 100%, every day.

{"date": "Sunday, March 11, 2007", "body": "\n Spring came to the middle of the US in full force this weekend.  It was such a beautiful day that we had to go out to the park.  It seemed our whole town was out there today. We took the bikes with us for the first official ride of the season.  Our park has a paved path that loops around the outside of the park.  When I announced we were going to the park to ride bikes, Buddy Boy initially didn't want to go.  Inertia is always a force to be overcome, and he was involved in watching some cartoon he had just turned on.  But I just told him we were going in 5 minutes, and he didn't put up any resistance when it was time to go (probably mostly because he really  does  like to ride his bike). I'm really glad that Buddy Boy has gotten the hang of riding a bike.  I'm a somewhat dedicated amateur rider (not nearly as dedicated as I used to be), and riding serves as moving meditation to me.  The rhythm of the wheels and the pedals, the wind in my face, and the motion all combine to make a sensory experience that soothes my soul.  It's been something that I wanted to share with Buddy Boy, and it's a good feeling knowing that he likes it, too.  Last year when he finally got the knack of riding without the training wheels he was so proud of himself he just glowed.  He knew he had accomplished something hard.  And it made me feel so good to see him so proud of himself. While loading the bikes in the car, Buddy Boy tells me he wants to take his safety gear (elbow and knee pads).  By the end of last season (his first season riding without training wheels) he was declining to wear the gear, having built up confidence in his riding ability.  I sense a bit of anxiety on his part that he'll still be able to ride. Liz is also a bit anxious about his riding ability.  She remembers how long it took us to lose the training wheels, and knows that it was only towards the end of the season last year that he was really getting it.  \"Perhaps you should take him to an open parking lot first to practice?\"  I declined, knowing (hoping?) in my heart that riding his bike would be to Buddy Boy like, well, riding a bike (something never forgotten once learned). It went just fine.  One push to get him going up the first little hill, and he was off, followed close behind by Sweet Pea, who is always trying to keep up/beat her brother who is 2 years older than she.  Buddy Boy quickly regained his confidence, even becoming a bit overconfident and running off the path almost into a bush.  He was a little upset, but quickly recovered.  He's done a lot better over the last year in terms of being able to regain his equilibrium. After two times around the park the kids wanted to go play on the playground equipment.  I got pushed into duty for one of their favorite games, where daddy plays the troll, and they try to escape (basically a game of \"chase me\").  I also spot another kid who is probably on the spectrum, there with his dad.  I debate whether to approach to make conversation.  I look in their direction, wondering if he's noticed us.  He hasn't, and he moves on. An hour later and its off to home again.  It's great that Spring is coming, and it's great to be rolling along again.

{"date": "Friday, March 9, 2007", "body": "\n Recently I had a chance to meet  Roy Richard Grinker , author of \"Unstrange Minds-Remapping the World of Autism\" at a book store.  He's been on a midwest and mid-southern tour of cities.  There was only a small audience, so I got to talk to Mr. Grinker a bit. I had had a hard day at work, rushed home to get in some play time with the kids, then went back to the book signing.  After the book signing I went home and had a beer while I caught up on some e-mail.  As per our usual routine, I got Buddy Boy up to go to the bathroom a little after 10:00 pm (if we do this he usually stays dry thru the night).  As I bent down to tuck him in afterwards, Buddy Boy says \"Don't drink beer, Dad.  It makes your breath smell bad.\"   I've been thinking about smell lately and how important it is to Buddy Boy, as well as a lot of other autistics.  Smell is probably the most ignored of all our senses.  Most of us don't pay much attention to it when we have it, but miss it terribly when it's gone.  It helps us make  scents  of the world.  Smells can warn us of danger, help us taste our food, increase our level of sexual arousal, and trigger memories of other times and places.  The first time I entered an operating room (other than as a patient) I caught a scent of something (cleaning agent, the smell of instruments coming out of the sterilizer, trace levels of anesthetic gasses?) that triggered a flashback to when I had my tonsils out as a 5 year old.  It was a vivid memory. Buddy  Boy has always had a keen sense of smell, and unlike most NT people, actively engages his sense of olfaction as he interacts with the world.  He smells the pages of books, food choices are heavily influenced  by their odor, and he smells people when he meets them.  He has learned that it's not considered polite to tell people that they smell bad, but doesn't think this rule applies to family members (which is OK with me, as long as he's not going around telling everyone else in the world they smell bad).  I'm hoping that maybe his increased sense of smell might help him in the workplace some day. So anyway, back to the book signing (you knew I wouldn't just let that go). I haven't had a chance to read Mr. Grinker's book yet, so my comments are just about meeting him as a person and having  a short conversation with him.  Roy Richard is a very engaging man.  He's the type of person I would love to have at a party, or to sit down over a pot of coffee or tea with.  He speaks Korean and Swahili, and has traveled around the world doing epidemiological research on autism.  But he's also a down to earth kind of guy.  Someone very much like the rest of us, just trying to do the best for our families every day.  He said that he sometimes still gets nervous going into IEP meetings, wondering whether the team will focus too much on the negative aspects of his daughter's performance rather than the positive ones. Grinker definitely falls on the \"acceptance\" rather than \"cure\" side, and in response to an audience question recommended the blogs of  Autism Diva  (he likes her attitude and opinions), Kevin Leitch's  Left Brain/Right Brain  (a very well thought out and knowledgeable site), and Kristina Chew's  AutismVox  (where 10 minutes after any news relating to autism is released, it's up on her blog). I don't pay nearly as much attention to my sense of smell as Buddy Boy, but Roy Richard Grinker passed  my sniff test when I met him.  I look forward to reading his book.

{"date": "Thursday, March 8, 2007", "body": "\n One thing I've learned (and teach) when it comes to crisis management is to \"Always have a plan B\".  Like a chess player, you always have to be thinking ahead about possible future states, your possible reactions to them, and the possible consequences of those reactions.   So although our present plan is to stay the course and try to work with our local public school educators to school Buddy Boy, we realize that that is subject to change at any time. We've looked at private schools in our neck of the woods, and at least for now, none are appropriate for Buddy Boy, or the ones we feel are, aren't willing to take him on at present. So rather than just hope for the best, we also have a \"Plan B\", which for now is home schooling. Last year we exercised this option when things were spinning out of control for us.  Rather than let Buddy Boy get wharehoused in a totally inappropriate setting, we withdrew him for a medical leave, and homeschooled him for Kindergarten. I think we're fortunate that we live in the US in this regard.  It seems that homeschooling is much more accepted here than it is in other places.  This is one trend that Europe doesn't seem to \"get\" as much. Tibetan Star's post  for March 2, 2007 linked an article from Germany where a teenager was imprisoned in a psychiatric ward for being homeschooled.  Also reported that day was a proposal from the UK to have a central computerized registry of all of those utilizing this form of education. Here in the US, laws vary from state to state, but most are fairly lenient.  Most states set some requirements in terms of curriculum and record keeping, but are fairly lenient when it comes to the credentials (or lack thereof) of parents.  According to Wikipedia, in 2003 there were 1.1  million  children being homeschooled in the US, or 2.2% of the school age population.   There is even a  legal defense organization  to support those who choose to homeschool. Sometimes, states even actively support parents in their efforts.  Though most states don't directly financially support homeschools,  this article  details how one state, Missouri, is proposing to give support for supplies and books to homeschools. Probably the biggest allure of homeschooling is the freedom from the predominant educational culture, which values conformity above creativity and individual expression. For now, we've decided to stay the course where we are.  Liz isn't wild about persuing the homeschool option (though she does a LOT of education with the kids as it is at the present time).  I think she's mostly concerned with the record keeping requirements.  But I'm sure we could handle this route if we have to.  And it's always good to know you have a \"Plan B\".

But I'm just not up to tackling those things today.  So we'll keep it a bit closer to home. I haven't totally figured out how Buddy Boy is \"graded\" every day.  Every day we get feedback from the school as to how he has done during each period of the day.  He gets either a green light, yellow light, or red light.  Besides getting a \"light\" for each period, there will also usually be explanations of his behavior for either yellow or red lights. Last week Buddy Boy started \"inclusion\" for one or two periods each day in his assigned first grade classroom (he hasn't been there all year-instead he has been in a self contained sp. ed class).  The first few days went well (novelty usually works to keep him distracted/interested) but the yesterday he got yellow lights, and today he got two red lights. There never seems to be a consistent standard for what constitutes a red light vs. a yellow light vs. a green light.  We have asked them in the past to clarify this, but have never really gotten a satisfactory answer. Today's red lights were for two things.  The first one was evidently when he was sent to the nurses office to take his midday meds.  Instead of proceeding directly to the office, he decided to go and visit teachers in other rooms.  While I realize that it's important to follow directions in school, marking an autistic kid down for socializing seems rather ironic to me (although it is consistent with the school district's unpublished motto  \"Obsequium Supra Omnia\" -Subserviance above all else[Thanks to Dr. Chew's correction of my grammar]). The second red light was for refusing to participate in a group activity.  No notations were made that any screaming or physical actions on Buddy Boy's place took part. So basically, I'm a little bummed that things aren't totally hunky dory with the inclusion thing this week.  But in my view, it's great that he's not doing anything that can get him suspended/expelled.  He's keeping it together enough to tell him what he doesn't like without getting physical with them.  As long as that keeps up, we can work on the rest.  Next week, we have  parent-teacher meetings, so perhaps we'll get a better idea of what exactly the different colors mean. As negative as this post might sound, we actually are making progress with the school, and I think Buddy Boy is, too.

{"date": "Saturday, March 3, 2007", "body": "\n What a difference a day makes. It was only yesterday that I was  flying high , rejoicing in the good news regarding an autistic young adult being accepted and honored in our department. This morning, right before going to work, I log on and peruse a couple of blogs, and what do I see but  this  story, quoted by MommyGuilt . ...On Monday, February 26, a 6-year-old autistic boy was read his rights and charged with Assault II for jumping on his special education teacher. This arrest was made when he and his mother went to pick up some files at the Kailua-Kona, Hawaii Police Department ... I think that the reason that this case struck me so hard was that many of the facts of this case seemed to parallel what had happened to our son a year and a half ago. ...Prior to jumping on his teacher, he was removed from his current classroom because the staff was worried he would hurt himself or others, and kept him in time- out from 10:55 a.m. until his mother picked him up at 2:00 p.m. ... When Buddy Boy was in Kindergarten (last school year, as a 5 year old) he, like many kids on the autism spectrum, had issues with self control.  Some of it was reacting to things in the environment, some of it may have been from delayed maturation, and I believe the  majority of it probably stemmed from the system expecting a 5 year old with autism to be compliant at all times.  All of their \u201cinterventions\u201d were directed at getting him to be compliant.  They didn\u2019t care whether he learned anything at all.  Indeed, any subject matter they presented was way below the types of worksheets that his mom, Liz, had him doing at home.  And when they did do things in class, they insisted on repetition to the nth degree.  This, of course, resulted in boredom and frustration on Buddy Boy\u2019s part.  Despite having all these things pointed out to them, his \u201cteachers\u201d persisted.   Due mostly to an idiotic curriculum not suited to him, and probably partially to lack of self control (in the face of being taught by idiots) Buddy Boy trashed the classroom one day.  He first threatened to trash the classroom (\u201cI\u2019m going to throw things\u201d) to which they responded with their direction of \u201cSit down, Buddy Boy\u201d three times, dutifully recorded on their chart that he had refused to sit down, then stood back when he started pulling things off the shelf.  No one acknowledged that he was angry and/or frustrated.  No one tried to find out why he was upset.  Just a command to sit down repeated three times.  Mom was called to come and get him and take him home. Buddy Boy was suspended for three days for that, and moved to a \u201cresource room\u201d where he was the only student.  We were warned at that time that if he continued to be violent and a threat to others and himself that the police would be involved.  Despite our convening another IEP (which they kept delaying) and attempting to get a much better behavioral intervention plan in place,  the staff continued to do things to set him off (deliberately, I suspect, but have no way of knowing other than their e-mails obtained later which intimated that they had a plan for a solution in place, while during this time they were telling us that everything was fine).  They had him \u201ctaught\u201d by as many as 7-8 different \u201cteachers\u201d per day, on no consistent schedule.  They would print up a schedule and show him on the clock when he would have a break, then another teacher would come in and cut the break short.  Still, all they were teaching was compliance with rules, and repetition of busywork.  He lashed out a couple of times at them (slapping and kicking), and each time he got \u201cwritten up\u201d without suspension.  The disciplinary write ups had these check off boxes on the form for reasons they thought the behavior occurred.  Almost all of the boxes had to do with the student (acting out, seeking attention, secondary gain, etc.).  There maybe was one for the environment, and none at all for \u201cprovoked by idiot staff\u201d, which was what I would have checked off. Buddy Boy acted out again (in this stellar teaching environment) and threw a stapler across the room.  This earned him another 4 days suspension.  At this point he was one suspension away from a mandatory placement in another setting.  We had already surmised that they were trying to build a case against Buddy Boy as an out of control kid that was a menace to himself and others, and had to be removed.  The placement that they had in mind was in a separate school in a class of emotionally disturbed kids. Meanwhile, just so one can understand how Buddy Boy was doing in general, this is what was happening  outside  of school.  He had a weekly gymnastics class (that he grudgingly went to, didn\u2019t look forward to) where he functioned within a group setting with individual assistance by a high school student with no special ed training.  He also attended swimming class every Saturday morning (another non-preferred activity-he likes free swimming, but not swimming class).  He also functioned just fine in this class being taught by high school kids for the most part.  He attended church services without acting up, and though he argued with us a lot at home, we had gotten to the point where he was not aggressive with us. ...The school has been asked repeatedly to at the very least provide a one-on-one aide that is trained in the art of dealing with autistic children, or move him to a school for autistic children. ... In our case we had asked several times (since before he was even admitted to Kindergarten) for a 1:1 aide.  Each time we were refused. By this time we had progressed from just having an advocate with us to having a lawyer involved.  We short circuited their attempt to have him expelled by withdrawing him for a medical leave, and Liz home schooled him for six months (to complete the school year).  He had someone from the school provide some instruction in the home, but again they were somewhat clueless (instruction below level, repetition, repetition, show me you are compliant). Meanwhile we continued to convene an IEP for the following year (this year) with multiple meetings with staff and lawyers.  I think one of their strategies was to try and bankrupt us by having more and more meetings.  I think they also thought that if they had enough meetings then only my wife would show up, and not me.  They thought wrong. Our compromise that we agreed to was half time in their emotionally disturbed classroom (though we had it in writing that they did not have permission to use their preferred methods of discipline-physically removing kids into a padded room or a wooden box).  The other half time was to be spent in a special ed class located in a regular school (NOT the school he was in before).  For agreeing to this we got them to agree to an outside evaluation of Buddy Boy\u2019s behavior.  We had to wait a few months into the school year to get the evaluation, but the outside group said Buddy Boy was doing fine, and indeed should be in the least restrictive environment, and that there was no reason to bus him back and forth between two schools every day. So now Buddy Boy is in the special ed classroom in the regular school, and just this week he had his first inclusion in a \u201cregular\u201d class for art, which went just fine. I thought I was getting past my anger at how my son was railroaded last year, and of how idiotic many of the \u201cexperts\u201d at his previous school acted.  And how malignant they were in plotting behind the scenes to get him thrown out, even if it meant having a police record.  My reaction to this article today tells me I have a ways to go. The mother in Hawaii further relates: Many people have told me that I need take this to the media to finally get the help we need, and that is what I hope to do. I have done everything the school has asked and tried to work with them, to no avail. Now, here I am with a disabled 6-year-old with Assault II charges against him. Getting the media involved might just work.  It is my impression that Americans in general have become much more hardnosed and unforgiving of the acts of adolescents, and this has also led to prosecutors trying to prosecute younger children (some as young as 10 years old) as adults in violent crimes.  But I still think that 6 year olds get somewhat of a pass in society, and media attention might help.  Of course, being disabled lowers the age of what is considered acceptable to prosecute, as does being poor or a member of a minority. Finally, the mom writes: We are filing for a Fair Hearing. But I understand this will take months and my child is not being educated nor is the school providing any help with his education, even though they know neither he nor I are able to go on school grounds because of the temporary restraining order.\" Finally, something they definitely can\u2019t do.  As I hope the mother is aware, she needs a lawyer.  Maybe two.  Definitely one for the educational case, and possibly a second one for the criminal case.  If she's lucky the special ed/disability rights lawyer can do both for her. IDEA 2004 spells out specifically how they can kick your kid out of school (suspensions, expulsions), and how they can place him in an alternative setting.  It also spells out what they have to do in terms of providing education.  They end up not having to do much, but they have to do  something . The mother needs to inform herself what IDEA 2004 actually says, and the first place to start is at the  Wrightslaw website .  If you scroll down the left hand side there is a section called \"Law Library\".  In there you can see a button to click on for IDEA 2004.  If click thru to the  IDEA 2004 Statute and Regulation page , there is a link to download the whole law with commentary from the Federal Register. Basically the law says that the school can suspend a child for up to 10 days without providing any instruction.  After that the IEP must meet to decide what is appropriate to be provided (this, of course, is the same IEP team that got you into this mess to begin with).  The school also must provide a functional behavioral assessment and behavioral intervention services and modifications, that are designed to address the behavioral violation so that it does not recur.   Once a change in placement is determined (and they can't kick you out without a change in placement), within 10 school days an IEP team meeting must take place to determine whether the behavior was a result of the child's disability or not (of course, I've never heard of a school in this situation admit that the behavior was a result of the disability, or a failure to follow the IEP). Finally, they can remove a child to an \"interim alternative educational setting\" for not more than 45 days, even if the violation was secondary to the child's disability if one of the following special circumstances occurs: 1) carries or possesses a weapon at school, 2) uses or possesses illegal drugs at school, or 3) has inflicted serious bodily injury to another person while at school or a school function.  Of note, \"serious bodily injury\" is defined in the US Code as follows: Title 18 USC Sec. 1365                                             (3) the term \"serious bodily injury\" means bodily injury which       involves -            (A) a substantial risk of death;           (B) extreme physical pain;           (C) protracted and obvious disfigurement; or           (D) protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily         member, organ, or mental faculty; and         (4) the term \"bodily injury\" means -            (A) a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn, or disfigurement;           (B) physical pain;           (C) illness;           (D) impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or         mental faculty; or            (E) any other injury to the body, no matter how temporary. My guess (and I am NOT a lawyer, and none of this is to be construed as legal advice)is that they would have a hard time proving \"serious bodily injury\".  But unfortunately, this person needs a lawyer badly, to try and stop the steamroller that this school district has set in motion. I really wanted to bask in the good feeling I had yesterday for a while.  I'm a realist, and I know that not everyday is good.  And part of me wishes I didn't see that blog posting this morning. But part of me knows that being vigilant, and keeping our legal ducks in a row is an important part of advocating for Buddy Boy.  Because one of my worst fears is that something like this will happen to us.

{"date": "Sunday, March 4, 2007", "body": "\n I almost titled this post \" The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly \".  I figured I'd link to  Thursday's post  for the \"good\",  Friday's  for the \"bad\", and today's would elucidate the \"ugly\".  But then I thought that might be too tacky. What I want to talk about today is something I have been thinking about for awhile.  It's how hierarchies are developed in the disabled world, especially when it comes to those with autism spectrum disorders. A side discussion on this started in the comments section on  AutismVox , but I thought it deserved a topic of its own. Developing hierarchies within minority communities is nothing new.  Within the African-American community in the US,  skin color  has served for a long time as one of the primary factors in developing an internal hierarchy within the community.  Those who were light skinned were looked upon as more cultured, more civilized, and more likely to succeed.   Conferences  are held to study how this still goes on today. When we were looking to adopt, we became acutely aware of adoption's  dirty little hierarchy .  Basically the main pecking order (for popularity of children) goes like this: white > asian > light skinned hispanic > mixed race african american > black.  Native Americans are generally left out of this, as their tribes can (and often do) veto adoptions outside of the Indian Nations.  There are also two other factors that dictate \"desirability\" and popularity.  The first is healthy beats disability, and the second is babies beat older kids. Sometimes the above factors interact to bump a kid up or down over another, but for the most part, skin color rules.  No one ever talks about this much in public, but when you're looking to adopt it's communicated to you by the system (agencies, lawyers, and even some other parents thru adoption). So one of the \"interesting\" factors that has emerged as we travel this journey with autism is of how hierarchies are formed within the autism community.  It would seem that, just like society as a whole, verbal beats non-verbal hands down, in a big way.  When people talk about \"high functioning\" vs. \"low functioning\", often the only major difference between the two groups is whether the person is verbal or not. Probably the other big factor that enters into this is whether the individual conforms to societal norms for civility.  Thus throwing a tantrum, screaming, yelling, stomping your feet, etc. instantly loses you 50 points on a 100 point scale.  Not only is this valued in society as a whole, but even when I've been at functions where there are many autistics, the parents of those kids \"acting out\" are still looking around furtively, while some other parents seem to have a smug look about them.  While the \"guilt\" of the parent of the kid acting out may be a holdover of how society treats her everyday, where does the smugness of the parent of a kid on the spectrum not acting out at the moment come from?  [As a side note, I must confess that when I am in public and there is a NT kid \"acting out\", I sometimes am guilty of getting a little smug-right or wrong, I consider this different than looking down on \"one of our own\"]. I think that the only other major factor that enters into the equation of where one sits on the \"autism hierarchy\" is whether one has complete bowel/bladder control. Other things that you might think are important don't seem to matter quite as much.  Level of academic achievment, ability to play games, and ability to communicate matter, but don't seem to rise to the level of importance as the first three things I've mentioned. Perhaps it's just innate, that as humans we want to a)place everything into a category, and b)be competitive.  But I think we hurt ourselves, our kids, adult autistics, and everyone else in the \"autism community\" when we set up petty little hierarchies like this.  Most of the \"normal\" world will probably have the same stereotypical view of you/your kid once you say the word autism.  Trying to show how you are better than \"those other autistics\" hurts us all, whether you're talking to someone in the outside world, or someone within the autism community.  We'd be much better off trying to change the stereotype that society as a whole has of autism.  It's a harder (and slower) process, but in the end will serve us all much better.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 28, 2007", "body": "\n I\u2019ve been trying to understand for several months why Buddy Boy wants to be a machine or an inanimate object.  I think if I can  \u201cGrok\u201d  this it might help me to see things thru his eyes a bit better. Although Buddy Boy has rarely voiced a desire to be a particular type of person (he used to always say he wanted to be a farmer when he grew up) for the past year or so he\u2019s always wanted to be some sort of machine (or occasionally an inanimate object).  When I say that I would like to have a Ferrari someday (hey, I can dream, can\u2019t I?) Buddy Boy will say that he wants to be a fast car when he grows up.  He doesn\u2019t want to fly a plane, he wants to be a plane. I don\u2019t necessarily think that this is a bad thing.  Buddy Boy has always had a fascination with anything mechanical.  Sometimes he\u2019s obsessed about them (he could stare for hours at conveyor belts), but mostly I think he\u2019s intrigued by them.  As long as he doesn\u2019t totally shut out everything else, we think this is great.  We took a long drive in the country a couple of autumns ago, in search of combines in the field.  We found some working near enough to the road to get some pictures, and had one of the pictures made into a puzzle that he still gets out and uses today. Sometimes I think that Buddy Boy's wanting to be a machine is just a bit of magical thinking on his part.  But mostly I wonder if Buddy Boy is  so  into the things he likes that he  totally  identifies with the machine or object.  In so doing, the only way to really understand the machine is to  be  the machine.   Sometime this identification with things is a bit maladaptive.  Buddy Boy has a hard time allowing us to wash his clothes in a washing machine.  He hides his dirty clothes in his favorite hiding places to protect them from the washing machine.  His offered compromise is that he says we can wash them only if we hand wash them.  While I think it\u2019s great that he offers to negotiate (negotiation as a preferred method of getting something, as opposed to screaming, grabbing, and hitting are all things we have been working on), it\u2019s just not realistic to expect Liz to wash all of his clothes by hand.  So we revert to a bit of diversion and subterfuge, putting the clothes aside and promising not to wash them then.  Later, when he\u2019s not watching, we throw them in the washer.  When asked by him later if we washed them in the washer, we tell him yes, and he seems OK with that.   But other than instances like this, I don\u2019t see any real harm with him wanting to  be  a machine (or an object).  If being so focused on something that you want to be that thing can help you understand it, then maybe the heightened understanding gained from this experience will help in designing better machines.  Only time will tell.  Until then, anyone with a spare Ferrari in their garage, feel free to send it my way.

{"date": "Friday, March 2, 2007", "body": "\n I've written before about  \"Little Hurts\" .   Well today I get to report on the other side of the coin, the small victories. I work in a department of about 100 people.  Our offices are in several different buildings spread over 4 or 5 city blocks.  About two years ago or so, our department was approached by a local agency that helps support disabled people in finding (and keeping) jobs.  Up until this time each individual section tasked someone to interface with the campus mail system.  When this agency approached our office manager to inquire whether we could use anyone, she decided that she could free up secretarial time (which we needed to do) and create an internal mail distribution person for our department. Susan (our office manager) doesn't have kids of her own.  She is a perfect employee, always knowing exactly how to get things done, never complaining, and being very efficient in getting the best out of others.  Some of the secretaries think she expects too much, but I've always thought she did a great job. Susan hired Michael thru this agency.  He is paid a normal salary for this position.  And he is quite obviously autistic.  His gait is a little off, he rarely makes eye contact, and he doesn't say much.  Michael is about 18-20 years old, and lives with his parents.  The agency supported Michael by sending a \"coach\" with him for the first few weeks who worked very closely with Susan and Michael to get him trained.  Now the coach comes periodically to check on him, and more often if there are particular problems that we need him to help us with. I've seen Susan reading things about autism on the web, so as to try and understand how best to work with Michael.  She has been as instrumental in Michael being successful in his position as the agency that placed him. Now for the really good part... I was walking thru the department today, and I look up at the wall where there is a framed certificate on the wall announcing the \"Employee of the Quarter\".   MICHAEL IS THE EMPLOYEE OF THE QUARTER!!!! I was so happy I almost cried.  The employee of the quarter doesn't get much.  You get the certificate, bragging rights, and I think you get a small token gift.  The award is voted on by all the members of the department every quarter. So it isn't that it's such a big thing.  But to me it's HUGE.  A young adult autistic who just as easily could have been cast aside is not just \"tolerated\" by the people in our department.  He has been accepted.  And supported.  And I just had to share that.

{"date": "Tuesday, February 27, 2007", "body": "\n Tomorrow (Tuesday, 27th of February, 2007) the  Winkelman case  is scheduled for oral arguments before the Supreme Court of the United States. I know this may be boring to those outside of the US, but this is something that is important to all parents of special needs kids in this country. Basically, the question at hand is whether parents can be allowed to represent their children before a Federal court when cases under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) are tried.  Generally speaking, only a lawyer can practice law, and one must be hired to represent you before the court. And, in an ideal world, we all would like an attorney to represent us and our child's interest when appearing in court.  There are only two problems with that. First of all is the shortage of lawyers trained in special education law. The second big hurdle, of course, is money. It costs a lot to hire attorneys, and by the time a case makes its way to a Federal court most families are going to be tapped out when it comes to raising funds. To backtrack a little, I'll give you a short synopsis of the case, which illustrates how the system works. The Winkelmans have two children on the autism spectrum. One, according to them, was adequately educated by the local school district. The other one exhibited many \"behaviors\" in pre-school, and the parents felt that the school was not providing an appropriate education, and had an inadequate plan to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) which is the law. The Winkelmans enrolled their son in a private school that specialized in autism, while petitioning the school district for reimbursement of the funds they were paying in tuition (greater than $50K/ year on a yearly income of less than $40K/ year). They were initially denied placement in this school, and appealed the case to a Federal court. The court has postponed deciding this aspect of the case. Rather, the court ruled that the parents could not represent their child before the court, and that they must retain an attorney. This is the only aspect of the case that is up before the Supreme Court tomorrow. Two more in-depth discussions of this case can be found  here  and  here . So why is this so important? Most things are decided at a local district level and never get to court, so what's the big deal?  The deck is already stacked against parents in advocating for their children's rights for a FAPE under IDEA in the LRE (Least Restrictive Environment). Anyone that has gone to an IEP (Individual Education Plan) meeting for their child knows of what I speak. Typically at our IEP's the ratio varies from 15:2 to 20:4, in terms of how many people the school district has lined up on their side vs. how many we have on ours (one or two parents, advocate, lawyer). School districts often like to make the rules up as they go along, and try to get parents to sign off on whatever it is that they (the district) want to do. If you as a parent are not fully aware of your rights and the law, it is easy to get bulldozed in the process. If indeed you call the district out for acting badly, then they have a team of lawyers at their disposal, and public funds to pay them with. You, of course, have to pay for your own lawyer. If you and the district can't agree on a plan for your child, then you are entitled to file what's called \"due process\". The latest iteration of the IDEA rules spell out that if the parent's suit is judged to be frivolous or without merit, then the parents are responsible to also pay for the opposing side's legal fees. Two recent Supreme Court decisions also tend to tilt the playing field against parents. The first is the  Schaffer  case, where the court decided that the burden of proof rests with the plaintiff (the family) when pressing a case against the school district. The other decision is the  Arlington Central  case, where the court decided that even if the parents won, they could not recover their lawyers' fees from the school district (generally speaking-but not always in civil suits, the loser is liable for lawyer's fees for both sides). Before the court tomorrow, the school district is expected to argue that parents need to hire lawyers because a) parents are not smart enough to properly represent their children's rights, and b) if parents are allowed to represent their kids, then a flock of ill conceived and frivolous suits will clog the court system. I hope that the Supreme Court exercises some common sense here. Most parents that would go this route are very sophisticated when it comes to knowledge and interpretation of special education law. They are also smart enough to get a lawyer if they can, but representing their child themselves may be their only choice if they cannot afford a lawyer and their is no lawyer willing to take the case for free. Also, pursuing a case in court is expensive, in terms of time and money, even without the cost of your lawyer figured in. I know that parents of special needs kids aren't going to be running out and filing frivolous lawsuits. If the Supreme Court rules against the parents, then the deck will be stacked even higher against parents. Only the most well healed parents will be able to afford the cost of a lawsuit against the school districts. The districts, realizing this, will be able to be even more arbitrary in their decisions on what are appropriate services. And our children will suffer.

{"date": "Monday, February 26, 2007", "body": "\nThere was a surgeon who used to work at a hospital I worked at. Had a bad accident (broadsided by a drunk when he was driving home).  He had some orthopedic injuries, but his hands were fine.  He almost totally lost the ability to talk, however.  And when he could speak again, his speech was nearly unintelligible, even with speech therapy. It took him far longer to return to work then it should have.   His colleagues suggested he should take disability.  They seemed embarrassed to have him around.  They pretty much shunned him.  They didn't think patients would understand him.  The hospital didn't want him back.  Everyone assumed that since his speech was affected, his whole brain was damaged.  Pity they could give, but not understanding. He had to fight hard to get his job back.  And that included a long time being supervised by fellow surgeons having to \"prove\" that he really could operate. And I wonder, just what is it about speech, anyway? Out of our faculties, it seems the one that is most tied to other's perception of intelligence and personhood.  I mean, why is the lack of speaking ability sometimes referred to as being dumb (as in \"He's deaf and dumb.\")?  In the 1968 movie  \"The Planet of the Apes\"  (which my quite sophisticated wife loves for some unexplained reason) Charlton Heston lands on a planet much like Earth, where the Apes and Chimpanzees talk and are intelligent, and the humans are mute and are looked down upon by the ruling apes. If you look at people that are blind vs. people that are deaf (and also usually mute), the blind people are often much more readily integrated into \"normal\" society.  The deaf/mute are shunted off to the fringes of society.  People who don't speak are often assumed to be \"dumb\", not acknowledged, not taught, and not valued at all by society. And though my son speaks (totally understandable, though his speech patterns and idioms are sometimes a bit \"off\") many with autism struggle with this, and some never do to an appreciable degree.  This has led to many quite intelligent people in the past being labeled as retarded, and shunted off to institutions to be wharehoused.  It also leads to continuing misunderstandings when autistics with limited speech venture off into society.  Amanda Baggs relates on  her blog  many of the sometimes sad, and othertimes horrific, things which have happened to her over the years as a somewhat non-verbal autistic. Nowadays there are  assistive communication devices  that are available to help non-verbal people be understood.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently  wrote  of his impressions of autism after meeting Ms. Baggs, who used a voice synthesizer.

I was alone, and able to indulge some of my eclectic musical tastes.  I ended up listening to some  Cowboy Junkies , the  Diner Junkies , and  Willie Nelson  (an ex-junkie). Maybe I'm just picking up one of Krisina Chew's habits and  seeing autism everywhere.   But as I'm listening to Willie singing the above song I heard those lyrics, repeated the track again to make sure I heard them right, and the thought occurred to me, \"I'm not raising a son with autism, I'm raising a cowboy\". And I thought (I do a lot of free association and just plain weird thinking while driving long distances alone) \"I wonder if the world would understand my son better, and treat him better, if I just told them he was a cowboy?\" Cowboys have a long tradition in America, and despite a few people using the term \"cowboy\" in a negative sense when referring to President Bush, there is a long and deep tradition of positive attributes being attributed to cowboys.  Mention being autistic, however, and there only seem to be negative stereotypes that come to most people's minds. Cowboys are entrenched in the lore of the United States, with many of them acheiving  legendary  status. Most cowboys were men, but some (like Annie Oakley) were female.  Cowboys were (and are) generally people who don't talk much, and are rugged individualists.  They tend to keep to themselves, and don't much care if others understand them or not. Cowboys have a code of  ethics  that is looked up to so much that some have suggested a  version of it  be used to instill ethical business practices in individuals. I could see it now.  When the school calls to complain about Buddy Boy exhibiting some behavior that doesn't seem to fit the mold they want to put him in, I could just say something like \"You don't understand, he's a cowboy.\"  This would be all that I would have to say to convey to them that my son was different, and in a good way.   Rather than expecting him to conform to arbitrary rules they had set up, they would instantly understand (because of the shared cultural knowledge) that my son was indeed different, and was probably destined for greatness.  As they had a genuine cowboy amongst their midst, they would fall all over themselvs making efforts to individualize their educational efforts, much as all of society caters to celebrities.  They would also expect great things from him, and as  many studies  have shown, when teachers expect great things from students they tend to get them. My apologies to any Europeans reading this.  You'll have to get your own legendary figures to latch on to to get the schools (and society) to  treat you and your kids better.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/ReEW6CeMu8I/AAAAAAAAADQ/VgpOxNzSINw/s1600-h/800px-Cowboy_1887.jpg", "http://www.maplemusic.com/product.asp?dept%5Fid=2&pf%5Fid=01%2D05&lang=EN", "http://music.msn.com/album/?album=38243052", "http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Willie-Nelson/dp/B00008BXK3/sr=1-2/qid=1172375467/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/103-3428035-2910227?ie=UTF8&s=music", "http://www.autismvox.com/the-meaning-of-autismland/", "http://www.cowboy-heros.com/old-west-legends.html", "http://www.chrisbrocious.com/cowboy.html", "http://www.quarterhorseoutfitters.net/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=1997&Category_Code=QHO_GENERALINTEREST&Store_Code=QHO", "http://www.kidsource.com/kidsource/content4/student.expectations.html"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/02/on-raising-cowboys.html", "title": "\nOn Raising Cowboys\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 23, 2007", "body": "\n Like many, I have been saddened and sickened to read of case after case of abuse of disabled individuals.  Most recently,  Kristina Chew wrote  once again about the aversive \"therapy\" used at the Judge Rotenberg Center (JRC) in Massachusetts.   I linked from that site and also read what Kevin Leitch wrote on his site  here . Dr. Israel, who heads the JRC, studied at Boston's Harvard University around 1960, with B.F. Skinner, the behavioral psychologist.  His \"treatments\" at the JRC are loosely based on Skinner's operant conditioning theories.  The list of aversives used at the JRC include such things as electric shock therapy, hitting, pinching, and withdrawal of food privileges). I wrote recently about how  eugenics  has been with us since the 19th century.  One would think that after WWII the world, at least all those that considered themselves \"civilized\" would refrain from torturing other human beings.  Besides the  Nazi medical experiments  there were also  Japanese experiments  that did not receive as much press.  When I was growing up I was taught that what happened in Nazi Germany was an aberration, and could never happen in the modern world. Well, it wasn't long after WWII that a few psychologists proved that theory wrong.   Stanley Milgram,  a Yale University psychologist, conducted a now  famous experiment   in 1961 where he got ordinary people to administer electric shock \"punishments\" as part of an experiment on \"punishment and learning\" (no shocks were actually administered, but the participants did not know this).  Fully 65% of the participants continued increasing the level of shock to a level they were led to believe might kill the subject, just because they were told to. In 1971, Stanford University psychology professor Philip Zimbardo conducted another famous experiment, the  Stanford University Prison Experiment , where he got ordinary college students to psychologically and physically torture and intimidate fellow students while they were in \"guard\" and \"prisoner\" roles, respectively.  The experiment had to be cancelled early (after 6 days rather than lasting the planned 14 days) because the participants were increasingly spinning out of control. Some common themes emerge when we read about these experiments.  One is that the \"subjects\" or \"inmates\" are routinely depersonalized in some manner.  This appears to be essential in order to make the actions acceptable.  Another is that many people will just \"do as they're told\", even if it's something that they normally wouldn't do on their own.  Still a third factor is that many people will just \"go along with the group\" and not rock the boat.  So if everyone else is participating in torture, well, we will too. So it's not too surprising when  Amanda Baggs wrote  about what she had witnessed (or had done to her) in various institutions. Nothing that bad has happened to Buddy Boy (yet).  But a year and a half ago (when he was still 5) the school he was in \"helped\" him when he was not compliant by building a little jail cell out of heavy wooden chairs in a separate room, placing him in the middle, and ignoring him until he would do what they wanted.  We withdrew him out of that school, and upon reentering school this year he was placed in a class for emotionally disturbed kids (most of them older than him).  The standard treatment at this school (which we refused in writing to let them do to him) for non-compliance was to put the kids in either a padded room or a wooden box until they \"settled down\". We're out of that place, too, and thus far things have been better over the last two months.  But I can easily see that many, many people are thrown into situations that are much worse than what Buddy Boy had.  And that bullying, tormenting, and torture are not just accepted, but encouraged in many schools and institutions, because people are told that it will \"help\" the poor, non-compliant, weird individuals who are worse than animals. Human beings are capable of unspeakable things.  And each of us must remain vigilant to those acts and attitudes that allow these things to continue.

{"date": "Thursday, February 22, 2007", "body": "\nSo I come home to find Buddy Boy and Sweet Pea playing a game quietly by themselves. Yes, that's  right.  They were playing together (which isn't that unusual nowadays), but they were playing a  game , which I've never seen them do unmoderated and without a big  reward involved.  And to top it off, they were playing  quietly .  They're never quiet together.  It's always running, yelling, jumping off furniture, stuff like that.  Sometimes crawling around making animal sounds.  But never sitting on the floor, in one of their rooms, unsupervised, playing a game. They were playing a memory matching game.  One of those games where you lay out a few dozen cards face down on the floor/table.  When it's their turn, each player turns over two cards.  If the two cards match (their is only one match to each card) the match goes into their pile, and they get to choose two more cards.  If the two cards don't match they get turned face down again.  The one with the most cards in the pile at the end wins. Well Buddy Boy (just turned 7) was getting his clock cleaned fairly well by his younger sister, Sweet Pea (5 next month).  He was making some matches, but Sweet Pea was consistently ahead of him.  I guess in some ways I would have predicted that.  In addition to being PDD-NOS, Buddy Boy has ADHD symptoms.  So I wouldn't expect him to be able to concentrate well on remembering where particular cards were.   Though he did seem to be trying, and was somewhat frustrated by the fact that his sister had more matches.  On the other hand, Buddy Boy is great at remembering routes in the car, which Sweet Pea is clueless about.  She doesn't recognize she's near the house until she's two blocks away.  Buddy Boy, on the other hand, knows where to turn to get to important places, and when we was 18 months old recognized the specific nondescript strip mall where a favorite Chinese restaurant was located.  He would start to make noise and gesticulate whenever we went past it. So I don't think that his memory was faulty, and I'm not sure that it was all a matter of concentration, as he did seem to be attending to the task at hand well enough. One other difference  I noticed in how they played this game was in their game strategy.  Sweet Pea had quickly incorporated a successful strategy of when something that she thought she knew where the match was came up in Buddy Boy's pick, when it was her turn she first turned over the card that she thought matched the one she had just seen, and if she picked correctly, then turned over the (known) card that Buddy Boy had just revealed in his turn. Buddy Boy, on the other hand, had a much less successful strategy.  When he thought he knew where the two cards were, he first turned over the (known) card that had just been revealed in Sweet Pea's turn, and then turned over the card that he thought would match it.  I tried to explain to him how to use the more successful strategy that Sweet Pea was using, but he just didn't seem to comprehend what I was getting at (perhaps my description was as clear as this written one :o ). The whole episode just seemed amazing to me on many different levels.  First, to see Buddy Boy voluntarily playing a game quietly with his sister was an amazing sight.  It was HUGE! Seconly, watching Buddy Boy and his sister playing like this was fun, because I could almost see how they were thinking. Finally, it was interesting to see how something that Buddy Boy is very good at (remembering things) didn't serve him very well in a game that is mainly about, well, remembering things.   Each task in life is usually much more complex than we appreciate.  What appears a simple task often is made up of a multitude of thought processes and actions.  And even if part of the process is functioning well, the other parts are necessary in order to have optimum functioning of the system. I'd love to see more research into how autistic people learn, and if there are common ways that autistics learn.  Then maybe I could teach Buddy Boy his own successful strategies for keeping up with the Sweet Pea's of the world.

{"date": "Saturday, February 17, 2007", "body": "\n We are fortunate that we live in a very good school district.  At least that\u2019s what I thought when we adopted our son 7 years ago.  Our school district is one of the best in our area, and routinely sends a high proportion of its grads to prestigious universities across the country.  Unfortunately, over time I\u2019ve come to understand that perhaps our district isn\u2019t as great for our son as I once thought it would be. First of all, there\u2019s the problem that our district is the victim of its own success.  Our district has historically enjoyed such a good reputation that a higher percentage of parents send their kids to the public schools in our district than in other districts.  Even though many of the families in our district could afford to send their kids anywhere, they choose the public schools because of their perceived quality.  Their\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that, except that all of the schools in our district are now bursting at the seams with kids, to the extent that trailers are being brought in to serve as additional classroom space. This means that rooms that were previously used as special ed classrooms are being taken over for regular classrooms, and sometimes there are two sped classes combined into one room, with cubicle dividers put up between them.  Hardly an ideal setup for kids with noise and distractibility issues.  Also, the school administration seems to be in constant \u201ccrisis mode\u201d trying to deal with the sheer volume of students, and is thus not very interested in any particular individual student. Secondly, there seems to exist what has been described at  \u201cWrightslaw.com\u201d  as \u201corganizational narcissism\u201d:  \u2026In my experience, people who work in affluent school districts are far more difficult to deal with that people who work in inner city or rural school districts. As Pam says, people who work in affluent districts are subject to \"organizational narcissism.\" School personnel in affluent districts tend to view themselves as superior to people who work in less affluent districts. This belief is often manifested as arrogance. \u2026 This is something that we have definitely run into in our district.  When comparing notes with other parents on a local autism list-serve that I am on, it\u2019s obvious that our district goes out of its way (more so than some other districts around us) to try to impose its wrong views on parents, no matter what.  We\u2019ve considered moving because of this, but after a year and a half of arguing (along with our advocates and a lawyer) with the district, we are to a place where things are a little better, and we definitely know the players (and them us).  So we\u2019re a bit reluctant to strike out and start all over again at this point. Finally, I have been very disappointed by some of the responses that have been made to us and other parents of special needs kids by others in the community.  We live in an area that is solidly middle to upper middle class, with some really well off people thrown in, as well as a few lower middle class.  The area is solidly Democratic politically, and everyone is expected to recycle, talk about global warming (even while driving large SUV\u2019s) and to toe the line on other progressive issues (guns, abortion, diversity, etc.).   Unfortunately, it would appear that many are very hypocritical when it comes to the inclusion and support of our \u201cneurodiverse\u201d kids.  Some complain at school board meetings about money and space devoted to special ed kids that could be better spent on their normal kids, while others complain about the \u201cbehaviors\u201d of some of the special ed kids that are disrupting and disturbing their own little angels. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a point to be made here, or whether I\u2019m just letting off a little steam.  I guess if there\u2019s any point to be made, it\u2019s that a school district is much more than its reputation or statistics.  I would certainly talk to other parents before moving anywhere new, but even then you have to take everything with a grain of salt, as there are individual personalities within each individual school, as well as the fact that each school or district may be generally good with some disabilities, but awful when it comes to dealing with \u201cdisruptive\u201d children. **n.b.  If you live in the US and have a special needs child, I highly recommend  Wrightslaw.com .  It is a great site chock full of really good advice on IEP\u2019s, advocacy, and special education law.

{"date": "Monday, February 19, 2007", "body": "\n If you were to bring up the subject of eugenics in conversation, I would suspect that many people would have to stop and think a bit about what you were referring to.  Of those that actually were conversant with the concept, I suspect that most would associate it with the quest for racial purity taken up by Nazi Germany.  Few, however, would think of the United States. Yesterday morning I was in a local bookstore and was browsing thru the book  \u201cChoosing Naia\u201d.   I am drawn to reading stories of people\u2019s journeys, and this book is a good one that chronicles an interracial couple\u2019s raising of a daughter with Down\u2019s Syndrome.  The couple recount how they had taken a screening test for genetic abnormalities (including Down\u2019s) which had come up negative.  They go on to say that even if it was positive, they were going to use the information to prepare themselves to deal with it, and not to abort the child.  This is backed up by the fact that when the mother again became pregnant, they decided against any prenatal testing, deciding that they already knew they could deal with whatever happened.  At one point they had a slightly uncomfortable conversation with the mother\u2019s parents centering on abortion and its use in preventing the birth of children deemed to be defective. When I came home from the bookstore I read a piece on  Autism Vox  talking about genetic testing, and how some tests have intimated that they might be able to screen for autistic like behaviors. While in college I was dimly aware of the eugenics movement in the US, but always thought it was mainly something that happened somewhere else (i.e., Nazi Germany).  I\u2019ve been reading a lot lately about prenatal testing being used to encourage parents to abort kids with Down\u2019s Syndrome, as well as many people wondering if this is the future that will be pursued when/if definitive testing for autism surfaces.  George Will has written about this subject  here  and  here .  I\u2019ve also started looking into the history of the eugenics movement in the US, as I believe that it may have some bearing on how people still act today. Eugenics is a social philosophy which advocates the improvement of human hereditary traits through various forms of intervention.  The term eugenics was coined in England by Sir Francis Galton, a cousin of Darwin, in the late 19th century.  Early proponents focused on selective breeding as a means towards this end.  In the 20th century proponents included such prominent people as Winston Churchill, George Bernard Shaw, and Alexander Graham Bell. Another more ominous form of eugenics included forced sterilization laws.  The first law successfully passed in the US was in the state of Indiana in 1907, which was followed by laws in California and Washington.  Eventually 27 states passed laws that were aimed at forced sterilization of the mentally retarded, the blind, deaf, criminals, and epileptics.  Different states had different variations of the laws, and as many as 65,000 individuals were sterilized against there will under these laws.  Although after WWII this practice faded greatly, there were still a number done into the 1960\u2019s, and even sporadic cases as late as 1981.  During the 1970\u2019s  Native Americans  underwent forced sterilization, which was encouraged by government policies.   Abortion was legalized across the US in 1973.  Prenatal testing enables testing for things like Down\u2019s Syndrome and Spina Bifida.  With the onset of non-invasive prenatal testing, some estimate that as many as 80-90% of fetuses with these two conditions are aborted, and many feel that the \u201cright\u201d to abort a disabled child has become one\u2019s \u201c duty \u201d. The OB-GYN societies of both the US and Canada are  both recommending  prenatal testing for Down\u2019s syndrome for all pregnant women, not just women over 35. So basically there has been an uninterrupted period of time from the 19th century until now where eugenics has been practiced in some form (selective breeding, forced sterilization, abortion) in the US.  It\u2019s not a new concept, but something that has been with us for a long time.  And it is so entrenched in our subconscious that most people don\u2019t really blink when they encounter societal attitudes that encourage \u201cweeding out\u201d so called \u201cdefectives\u201d among us.

{"date": "Friday, February 16, 2007", "body": "\nWe have two children.  Buddy Boy, who is now 7 and PDD-NOS, and Sweet Pea, who will be 5 next month, and apart from possibly being a little hyperactive, is NT. Sweet Pea, like any 2nd child (I was one myself), is very competitive.  She always wants to do what her older brother does, and is always trying to prove that she is better, faster, and stronger than her brother (or anyone else for that matter).  She also resents anything that Buddy Boy gets that she doesn\u2019t (like rewards for certain behaviors). Last night we went to father's night at her pre-school, which she had been looking forward to for weeks (\"We're learning a new song, daddy\", \"I'm going to be a rhino, daddy\", \"How many days until father's night?\").  We both had a great time. But I\u2019m sure the time will come when she will confront us and ask us why we don\u2019t spend as much time with her as we do with her brother.  And of course try to guilt us by saying we don\u2019t love her as much. What Sweet Pea doesn\u2019t realize, and may not believe when I tell her, is that one of the gifts that I have received because of Buddy Boy\u2019s autism is that I am a better father, both to her as well as Buddy Boy.  I\u2019m not perfect by any means, but I\u2019m sure that I\u2019m better than I otherwise would have been. When most kids are fairly young their parents are in the beginning to middle of their career cycles.  This means that they usually are paying a fair amount of attention to their careers, and letting the home life take care of itself.  Not that they\u2019re bad people, but the nature of being on the upswing of your career is that a lot of your energy is sucked out of you by the workplace, and this necessarily limits what you have left for your kids.  You rationalize it by saying that it\u2019s equally important to advance your career (income) so that you can provide well for your family.  And oftentimes half your kids\u2019 childhood has raced by while you\u2019re doing this. When a crisis hits your family (and even though autism itself may not be a crisis, dealing with the school system certainly has been) you are forced to acutely reevaluate everything you do.  Buddy Boy\u2019s autism has forced me to decide what is really important. Learning to deal with Buddy Boy\u2019s outbursts when he was younger has assisted me in deciding what\u2019s important.  Reading  Dr. Ross Greene\u2019s \u201cThe Explosive Child\u201d  helped us to approach both of our kids in a more supportive and collaborative fashion.  I\u2019m sure that I raise my voice less to Sweet Pea because of the things I have learned about interacting better with Buddy Boy.  Had I not been forced by extreme behavior to look for other solutions, I would have probably just bumbled along with my somewhat authoritarian nature. As it became clear that Buddy Boy was going to need a lot of time on my wife Liz\u2019s part as well as mine, both for advocacy as well as for day-to-day support of Buddy Boy, I had to make a decision.  Either throw up my hands and say I can\u2019t do any more, or do what most of us have done, and try to figure out how to best help my kid when he needed us.  For me it first meant that I changed jobs within our department.  I took a job with more predictable hours and more time at home.  This meant less income, but the tradeoff has benefited  my marriage as well as my relationship with both of my kids.  Recently it has meant turning down a promotion and having to serve on the search committee to find the person who will be my boss.  While I thought that we had gotten to a place where I could have handled this position without disrupting my home life, Liz did not think so.  I respected her perspective, and again this will mean that I will end up with more time at home with both kids then if I had taken the promotion.  We\u2019ll have to manage without the extra money (we haven\u2019t gotten anything more in our department than a token raise since 1998), but I\u2019ve never heard anyone on their death bed express regrets that they didn\u2019t earn more money. So I hope Sweet Pea realizes that while I\u2019m not perfect, I\u2019ve been a darn site better than I would have been as a parent, and spent more time with her than I would have, because of Buddy Boy\u2019s autism.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 14, 2007", "body": "\n Several years ago I went to visit Mr. B, the father of my best friend in high school.  I had spent a good deal of time at my friend's house during high school, and had become somewhat close to the rest of the family.  I always admired Mr. and Mrs. B's relationship.  No matter what obstacles they faced, they always maintained a quiet calm about them.  Although I did not have what could be described as a \"bad\" childhood, our household was always much more raucous and rough and tumble than the B's.  I think one of the reasons I preferred hanging out at my friend's house over mine is that it always seemed more peaceful. Mr. and Mrs. B and the family had had their share of tragedy in their life.  One of their son's had fallen into a river as a child and died while three sons were fishing with their dad. Despite this (or could it have been because of this) having happened, there was always a sense of the joy of life in their house.  Mr. B was dying, and I wanted to go and visit, as well as give some respite for the day to his wife, who was caring for him.   I spent a good deal of time talking to Mr. B that day, and one of the things that I asked him was what was the secret of having a good marriage.  Mr. B replied in his quiet, yet strong and direct, manner.  \"Most people talk about marriage being a partnership, and how things need to be 50:50.  Then when they don't get what they perceive is their 50% worth, they get upset.  I've always approached marriage as a 100% thing.  Sometimes you're giving 100%, and sometimes you're the one getting the 100% from your partner.  And sometimes it's some other percentage.  And you can't keep track of when you're giving it, and when you're getting it.\" Many years have passed since that day.  I'm not the best husband in the world.  I get cranky, can be self centered at times, and am not the greatest at cleaning around the house.  Yet whenever there are stresses in my marriage (financial, dealing with the school system, feeling sorry for myself when I turned down a promotion to be able to spend more time at home, etc.) I try to stop and remember my conversation with Mr. B from that day, and try to give my 100% to my wife.  And perhaps in doing so, I can pass some of that same joy of living that existed in the B's home to mine. So on this Valentine's Day, give your love 100%, and open yourself up to the fact that that 100% will come back to you at some point.

{"date": "Thursday, February 15, 2007", "body": "\nThe question often comes up regarding what do you say about your child\u2019s autism.  To others, the child himself (I am going to use himself instead of him/herself, as my child with autism is a boy), and siblings. My short answer is that it depends, and do what feels right. We have the advantage in our family of not only being the parent of a son with autism, but also of being parents thru adoption.  So we\u2019ve struggled with a somewhat similar question before. The question of what to say, to whom, and when, seems to figure prominently in discussions of autism.  Kristina Chew originally named her blog  \u201cMy Son Has Autism\u201d .  And MOM-NOS recently gave a  great description  of what many of us go thru when deciding how much information to impart when our kids are going to someone else's house.  And it seems that not a week goes by that I don\u2019t see posts from people wondering how much information to relate to people in various other situations. Well, for better or for worse, here\u2019s how we approach it. For our kids, it\u2019s easy.  Like adoption, talk about autism is natural.  We don\u2019t want our kids to feel that there is anything dirty or shameful about being autistic (or being adopted, for that matter).  So our natural conversation contains many references to autism, school services, social skills class, etc.  Our kids will be well versed in all aspects of IEP\u2019s, FAPE, LRE, ESY, ABA, etc.  In fact they will be so well versed they\u2019ll probably be able to serve as advocates by the time they graduate grammar school.  We talk about how all people have something that makes them different, and autism is one way of being different.  We also point out how being autistic can give you certain advantages in life.  This can sometimes lead to interesting playground exchanges: \u201cI\u2019m autistic.\u201d   \u201cI\u2019m artistic, too.\u201d   \u201cNo, I\u2019m AWWtistic.  Not artistic.  My brain is different.\u201d   \u201cUh, OK.  See you.\u201d While the kids still don\u2019t understand that they don\u2019t necessarily have to instantly share all aspects of themselves and their family life when meeting someone new on the playground, I\u2019d rather have that then have them think that there is something  \u201cwrong\u201d with them. Now when it comes to talking to others about autism and how it affects your family, then I\u2019d be inclined to recommend letting your gut guide you. For acquaintances and schoolmates, it seems that it\u2019s situational.  Sometimes we just say that Buddy Boy has some difficulties with social situations.  Sometimes we say that he has autism and sometimes this leads to him having problems with certain situations.  Sometimes (like a big picnic in a park where we run into people we are acquainted with) we don\u2019t say anything and just wait to see how things play out.  My gut tells me that I\u2019d rather have someone get to know Buddy Boy somewhat before telling them he has autism, rather than have to overcome any preconceived notions about autism they may have. When it comes to work, I\u2019ve never been one to go on and on about my home life with anyone within earshot.  Many people are more social than me.  You have to find what\u2019s comfortable.  I do have some close friends at work that I talk to, and to those people I talk about our family life, including the fact that our son has autism.  I try to let them know the good stuff as well as the not so good stuff, so they don\u2019t get a skewed view. In public, if we\u2019re causing a scene (which thankfully doesn\u2019t happen all that often anymore) it\u2019s sometimes necessary to do just as the good Dr. Chew does, and simply start out with \u201cMy son has autism, and \u2026\u201d.  At other times a simple \u201cSorry, we\u2019re just having a little difficulty today\u201d does the trick.  I think that personally I sometimes am hypersensitive to what I think others are perceiving.  If you look at NT kids in public, a lot of them are exhibiting \u201cbehaviors\u201d at any given time.  So I\u2019ve been trying to relax more and just go with the flow if we\u2019re really not bothering anyone else.  It\u2019s really none of their business. So that\u2019s it.  Honesty and forthrightness in the house, and using our gut instinct and common sense outside. So what do you do?

{"date": "Saturday, February 10, 2007", "body": "\n Liz brought home a book from the library the other day that I read to the kids.  It was a book on  Wilson \"Snowflake\" Bentley .  She picked it up because it looked interesting.  At any one time she actually has about 50 books on loan from the library.  Both of our kids love having us read to them, and we have set an arbitrary lower limit of 30 minutes/day for each of them (which is often far exceeded). So I'm a few pages into this book, and suddenly I get the realization,  this guy was on the spectrum!   The book mentions that he didn't like to play with other kids, never married, and was obsessed with the weather.  Now I have no way of proving he was on the spectrum, of course, but certainly there are several other clues woven into the story.   First of all, Bentley dedicated his life to taking pictures of snowflakes.  In his lifetime (during the late 1800's and early 1900's) he ended up taking pictures of 5000 different snowflakes!  That's a lot of snowflakes.  It took him two years of trial and error with a camera that he persuaded his parents to buy for him for Bentley to perfect the technique and capture the first snowflake (or more properly-snow crystal) on a photographic glass slide. I've read a bit more on him on the web today.  Bentley donated much of his collection to the Buffalo Museum of Science.  In a biography on  their web site  the following can be found: ...To the villagers of Jericho, Vermont, Bentley was considered odd, and was known to many of them as the \"Snowflake Man\" because of his quiet nature and unusual preoccupation with his snow photography. But Bentley was a sensitive, thoughtful man; a gifted and intuitive scientist who was also a talented musician. He played the piano, organ, clarinet, coronet, violin, and composed music for a community marching band. Though it was never confirmed that he stood barefoot in the street playing his violin as snow fell from the gray sky, he would occasionally entertain villagers by imitating the sounds of animals and birds with his violin. Frequently, however, the people of Jericho would watch as he hurried past them, camera under his arm, notebook in hand, running to capture freshly falling snow. ... Just think of what the world would have missed, if not for this \"oddball\".  Not only is his collection beautiful, but Bentley also made great advances in photomicroscopy and contributed to scientific understanding of a natural phenomena.  His birthday was yesterday, February 9th. So here's to the \"oddballs\" of the world.  The ones who see things that others around them don't, and have the intense interest to pursue passions that result in making all of our lives fuller.  The world would be much worse off without them.

{"date": "Thursday, February 8, 2007", "body": "\n ...Yeah I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around I'm never in one place I roam from town to town...                                  -from The Wanderer, Dion, 1961 We used to have elopement issues with Buddy Boy.  Anytime there was a chance to run, he took it.  He'd escape from the house and run thru the neighborhood, which we ended up solving by using keyed dead bolts (which were against code, but hey, we weren't selling the house, and they served a greater good).  He also used to escape from us in public whenever he had the chance.  Whether we were at a park, museum, aquarium, Disney World, wherever.  If he could get his hand out of one of ours for 2 seconds, he was gone. Fortunately, over the last year this behavior has pretty much extinguished itself.  Once in a while he'll leave us, but it's pretty much  now because there's something really interesting that he wants to see, not running for the sheer joy of running and playing \"chase me\". Unfortunately, over the last couple of months a new issue has come up.  Buddy Boy used to sleep thru the night (but never past 6:00 am, no matter what time he was put to bed).  Lately he's been getting up in the middle of the night, wandering thru the house, and then going back to sleep in another room.  Usually this means the living room or family room.  Sometimes he has come into our bedroom, but then we immediately take him back to his own bedroom, so he has stopped coming there.  We asked him why he does this, and he said that he just couldn't sleep.  He also said that the plastic mattress cover made too much noise.  We got him a new padded mattress cover that seemed to help, but in a week he was back to wandering again.   As with many things, we used a two pronged positive + negative reinforcer strategy.  We gave him gum (which he loves) if he woke up in his own bed, and took away things he liked (stuffed toys, building materials) if he didn't.  While we've had some success with this, it doesn't seem to be decreasing the behavior  any further (we're at about twice/week at this point). We hadn't adjusted any of his meds in the recent past, so we didn't think it was a medication effect (unless he had \"grown out\" of his current dose and needed to increase it).  So we tried giving him Melatonin at night, which helped get him to sleep, but then he would still get up later.  We tried upping his Guanfacine dose, which only left him sleepy during the day.  So we've taken to giving him a \"top off\" dose of Melatonin when we get him up at 10:00 pm or so to go to the bathroom, but even that has had limited success. I don't really care about the wandering, per se, but about safety issues if he gets into something.  Lately he's also taken to trying to disassemble things (like the clothes dryer) and engaging in one of his favorite activities, water play (which flooded the bathroom one early morning). On the one hand I'm caught in the present, and looking for concrete ways to keep him safe at night (short of having him move into our bedroom, or one of us moving into his).  On the other hand, I wonder and worry about what it means in a greater sense for his life.  Is Buddy Boy destined to wander his whole life?  Or will there be someone there to guide him if needed once we're gone, and supports in place to keep him safe and as independent as possible? Only time will tell.  Until then he'll wander, and we'll try to keep up, keep him safe, and teach him to keep himself safe.

I need to lose some weight.  I am 5'10\" tall (177.8 cm), and weigh 210 lbs. (95 kg), as of this morning.  I've been as high as 213 recently, but haven't been able to consistently take off any weight.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 7, 2007", "body": "\nNo, not that pro-choice... This article  on a Dallas/Fort Worth TV station's website, talks about a proposal to offer school vouchers to parents of children with autism.  The plan would give the parents the choice of either keeping their kids in  the public school or placing them in a private school of their choice.  The amount of the voucher would almost certainly not cover the amount charged by the private school.  But it might make the difference for some  families in being able to attend such schools. As it stands in my locale, we have the choice of sending our son to a public school, or paying ourselves (about $30,000/yr or more) for private school.  Some students are sent to the  private schools by the public school system, with total payment made by the public school system.  This only happens when it is proven that the public school cannot provide an appropriate education (which means that the public school never initiates placement in a private school, and usually a protracted and expensive legal fight is necessary in order to get the public school to ante up the money). Sometimes parents preemptively pull their kids out of the public school and place them in the private school while they are also undergoing the legal wrangling necessary in order to get the public school to pay.  This is not an option for most, however, as the double costs of the private school as well as the legal fight rapidly become staggering to all but the most well heeled. I think that, in general (there are some exceptions), the public schools are terribly failing to educate children on the autism spectrum.  There is no will, and no money, in the public school system to institute the kinds of therapies and supports that our kids need. I don't think that a voucher program is a cure all.  But if they took the money that they budgeted for special ed kids (say, 1.5X the average amount budgeted for the general education students) and let the parents apply that money somewhere else, it might make a meaningful difference to many families.

{"date": "Friday, February 9, 2007", "body": "\nNo sooner did I walk in the door last night than my wife tells me the news regarding the CDC releasing a new study saying that the incidence of autism in the US is now 1:150.  There's an article in yesterday's  Newsweek  discussing this. One of the main bones of contention between the curebies and the neurodiversity crowd is what exactly the incidence of autism is (or more accurately, if the number is increasing). I think that both miss the point, to a certain extent. The curebie crowd tries to use the numbers to show that there is an \"epidemic\" (can we ban that word from the English language for 20 years or so?  Or at least restrict its use to epidemiologists?).  Then extrapolate that if the number is increasing that there must be an environmental agent that must be exposed (usually mercury, but now expanding to other agents). The neurodiversity movement counters that the number is not increasing, and increasing numbers are solely due to better diagnosis.  To allow that there could be an increase in the numbers of autistics seems to admit defeat. Who cares?   Whether or not the number of autistics is increasing or not  does not  speak to what causes autism.  All of the numbers to date are approximations.  They  may  be becoming better approximations, but they're only approximations. In a time when we should be uniting to advocate for autistics, instead we are wasting  time in chasing numbers and divisive arguments that only serve to stall effective advocacy.  I just wish we could agree on certain things, and agree to (politely) disagree on others.  Unfortunately, the Web does not often lend itself to proper decorum.   I wish we could agree that: Statistically, the 1:166 and 1:150 are not different,  especially  since different populations were surveyed to come up with these numbers. Increases in the incidence of autism are certainly  at least  partially, and probably largely, due to better diagnosis. Lots of things are increasing in incidence-Asthma, Hodgkin's Disease, Crohn's Disease, Total Psychiatric Disorders, Total Population, Population Density, etc.  Just because any of these (or autism) increases, doesn't mean that there is an epidemic, or that a certain thing caused it (the eventual incidence of death for people born over the last 100 years remains unchanged at 100%, however).   We don't know what \"causes\" autism (other than genetic predisposition). The most important thing for people with autism is dealing with it in the here and now, today.  Research into \"cures\"  may  benefit future generations (after suitable ethical discussions are undertaken).  But what should be uppermost right now are things that will help autistics to realize their full potential.   Things like education (\"How do autistics learn best?\", and \"What compensations and \"work arounds\" are most compatible with their inherent way of thinking?\").  Things like fully valuing social skills instruction/coaching in the education system as important to a complete education.  Fully valuing autistics, such that they are not just given an \"adequate\" education, but are given an education that is individualized to their needs, and designed to maximize their potential (much like the general curriculum is designed to maximize the potential of NT kids). Things like adult support services.  The public sector's feet need to be held to the fire.  We can't just shuffle kids along thru the school years, just to turn them out without any support as soon as they \"age out\" of the system.  Proper supports can increase the level of independence of individuals, and are also liable to lead to better and higher paying jobs for these individuals (then they'll pay more taxes).  What do autistics themselves think are the most valuable supports? So let's just drop the numbers game for now, shall we?  Instead, let's concentrate on what we  CAN  do now.  And try to have a little bit of common sense and common courtesy in dealing with each other. For my part, I'm keeping my moniker of Club 166, no matter what the \"incidence\" changes to.  166 is a much cooler number than 150, which sounds so plain.

{"date": "Friday, February 2, 2007", "body": "\nSo the other night I attended a parent's association meeting at Buddy Boy's school. The majority of the meeting was taken up by the teachers explaining April's upcoming statewide test, which is mandated by the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) act. Now Buddy Boy is in the first grade, and these tests don't start in our state until the third grade, but it was interesting to sit there and listen nonetheless. Two thoughts came to mind as I pondered what was being said. First, it was obvious to me that the test was going to be very challenging for a lot of kids on the spectrum (especially mine). The test is written, long, contains a lot of 3 step instructions, and there is no assistance or directions allowed from the teachers once the test has begun.  I can just imagine Buddy Boy, who has a lot of ADHD type symptoms, sitting and filling out part of the first page. Before he even gets to the second page I can easily imagine him getting distracted by something (how the paper smells, what kind of design the cover has, etc., and zoning out for the next couple of hours until they tell him to turn in his book. Without someone prompting him to answer the next question, I just don't think the test will reflect what he knows. Also, while Buddy Boy can write, his writing tends to be slower than his peers and takes a lot of his energy. Again, sub-par writing skills may lead to significantly under representing how much knowledge he really has. Now,  Wrightslaw ,which I usually respect and pay attention to, seems to feel that NCLB will make schools stand up and take kids with disabilities seriously. Also,  this site  seems to agree with that sentiment. But it seems to me that unless a LOT of accommodations are made for special ed kids (and I can't see them doing that when they're testing large groups of kids at once, then a lot of our kids are not going to test well at all on these tests, and may be left further behind than otherwise. There's another potential problem that I see with how all this is done. The school very obviously \"teaches to the test\", and devotes the vast majority of their manpower from after the winter break until the test to drilling kids for the test throughout the school. What this meant this past year, when Buddy Boy was in Kindergarten, was that the bare minimum of people were in his class for several months last year, as any available aids were pulled to help tutor/drill the classes that were going to be tested. You see, our school district actively opposes \"paras\" for individual kids, and instead uses what I refer to as a \"zone defense\", where they will have one or two aides per 5-7 kids. Since the aides are not assigned to a particular child, the school is free to assign them \"temporarily\" where they are most needed (such as drilling kids in grades 3 thru 5 for the upcoming test). I imagine that any available personnel from the first and second grades were pulled, too, as neither of those grades were being tested. So for up to 4 months of the school year, the Kindergarten, first, and second grades are short shrifted teachers and aides. While NT kids may do all right with this, I feel certain that this led directly to increased meltdowns in class last year for Buddy Boy, because there were less people around to redirect him when he was in the early stages of having a problem in the classroom. This then resulted in less time learning for him, and him falling progressively farther behind. If it weren't for all the time my wife spends tutoring him outside of class he would be far behind academically. So the bottom line is that my mind is not at all made up about this. I think that NCLB is a good idea in theory, and could indeed result in more attention paid to kids with disabilities. But the devil is in the details, and I'm somewhat anxious as to how this is all going to pan out.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wrightslaw.com/nclb/info/myths.realities.napas.htm", "http://specialedlaw.blogs.com/home/2005/10/no_child_left_b.html#more"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/02/no-nt-child-left-behind.html", "title": "\nNo (NT) Child Left Behind\n"},

The other thing I immediately noticed were the plethora of different treatments that were espoused as being either helpful or necessary. Having been trained in the scientific method (I am a physician), I was very interested in the physiologic basis of how these treatments worked, and what scientific proof there was of there efficacy.  Behavioral therapy, communication strategies, diet modification, supplements, chelation, etc., etc., etc.  My head reeled with all the things that I could be doing.  Unfortunately, the more and more I looked at it, the more empty it all seemed.  Sure, ABA has a couple of studies that support it, and some things (like diet modification) have so little downside that trying them might be worthwhile.  But the majority of interventions seemed to be just so much noise.  All of us have precious little money to spend on interventions (after spending money on evaluations, OT's, PT's, advocates, doctors, etc.).   So why do so many people seem enamored of so many interventions that are probably not even useful, and may be harmful?  Kristina Chew, Ph.D., over on  Autism Vox  talks today about \"flocking\".  This indeed may be important in this phenomenon, but I have a slightly different take on this.  Personally, I think it is a combination of the decline of science education combined with magical thinking.  For a good discussion of magical thinking, see  this . Over the last few decades the number of college graduates obtaining degrees in science subjects has declined in  America, Canada, and Great Britain.   This article   briefly talks about the impact on the US economy, but I think there is also a tangible effect on how we as a society view many things in the world.  Unless one has some basic grounding in statistics and has some facility in critically reading scientific papers, the difference between causality and correlation disappear, and anecdotal evidence is viewed as equivalent with controlled studies. And if you have no way of differentiating between junk science and real science, then it all becomes just a lot of noise.

And there are things which hurt us (inappropriate placements, ignorant people in public, inappropriate treatment and comments from school staff, etc.). There are also a lot of good things in our life right now (my ability to move to a different job position with a little more predictable hours, positive interactions between Buddy Boy and his sister (as well as \"normal\" competition and arguing between them). But some of the things that hurt the most are the seemingly little things. This year Buddy Boy is in a different school than he was last year.  He started out last year \"mainstreamed\" in Kindergarten without an aide assigned to him.  This was disastrous (as we predicted during his IEP).  Instead of adding support in the classroom, he was pulled out and spent half the year in the \"resource room\" being \"taught\" by 7-8 different \"teachers\" a day.  They were never consistent, treated him as if his non-compliance was willfull on his part, and responded with suspensions.  This year he started off half time in a school for emotionally disturbed kids, and half time in a \"Communications Classroom\" at a different school than he attended last year (this was the best deal that we and our lawyer could get, considering the malicious paper trail they had layed).  Part of our bargain was for him to have an independent evaluation, which was done in November.  Since the holiday break he's been full time in the Communications Classroom, but still without any mainstream inclusion.   There is one other child in Buddy Boy's class that is also there full time.  The remainder of the kids in the class are mainstreamed with support for varying parts of the day.  The only things that Buddy Boy does do with other kids are recess, lunch, and all school assemblies (if he's able to tolerate the noise). Right before the holiday break the school had what they termed a \"Peace Assembly\".  They wanted to have a celebration before the holidays, but didn't want to offend anyone, hence the term.  This assembly was run by the parents association of the school.  For this assembly the kids practiced singing specific songs in Music class that would be sung at the assembly, and every kid in the school painted a rock for the assembly.  All the rocks were brought by the kids to the assembly, and they made a big thing about these rocks.  They are going to make a patio behind the school with these rocks embedded in it.  A big theme of this assembly was including everyone and everyone getting along together.  Parents were invited to the assembly to share in this experience.  Everyone in the school participated in the assembly. Everyone except for two kids in the Communication Classroom.  Neither of whom went out to Music class to practice singing the songs, and neither of whom went out to Art to paint rocks. We might not have found out about it, except that Liz did indeed attend the assembly, and was totally mortified that Buddy Boy wasn't included in this.  How welcome do you feel at a new school when everyone at the school does something, and you and only one other kid are excluded?  How hard would it have been for the parents association and the teachers to assure that ALL kids in the school were included? I know that it was an innocent oversite, born of ignorance.  No one  meant  any harm.  And after a flurry of e-mails, they have promised to do better next time (though they don't seem to think it was a big thing). But this one hurts.  Bad.  I'm sure that my son felt even more excluded and left out then he is usually made to feel by the system.  And there was absolutely no reason for that to happen.  What a great thing it would have been if someone had thought a little, and for once he was truly part of the group.  What a lost opportunity.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/02/little-hurts.html", "title": "\nLittle Hurts\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, January 30, 2007", "body": "\nOf the many different definitions of noise, two leap out at me as directly applying to autism. One is \"acoustic noise\", which can be defined as meaningless sound of greater than usual volume. The second is what I term \"informational noise\", or meaningless information that obscures true data. As this is only my second blogging post, I'm going to deal with the first definition today. I'll save dealing with the second for another time. The way Buddy Boy reacts to acoustical noise in his environment has always fascinated me. On the one hand, he is quite sensitive to many loud (and only mildly loud) sounds. The first time we took him to a circus we had quite a time of it (hands over ears, screaming, etc.). It was obvious that he was physically in pain. This same reaction has been repeated several times in many different settings, though over the last year or so it has not been as bad. We don't purposely take him to loud places (I may be a bad parent, but I wouldn't purposely torture my son), but he will want to go somewhere, we will warn him that it will be loud, he'll insist on going, then want to leave immediately. At the same time, though, there seems the innate ability to overcome/adapt/deal with acoustic noise if the stakes are high enough. For example, the lure of a McDonald's Happy Meal with it's enclosed toy is enough for Buddy Boy to want to go to the children's play area there (even though it sometimes has noise levels that hurt my aging ears). Another example is a kids play place in our area that has tubes to crawl through, food, and bunches of games for kids to play that pay out \"tickets\" (For Americans, think Chuckie Cheese on steroids). This place has noise levels that rival standing behind a 747 on a runway before takeoff. Yet I constantly get badgered by Buddy Boy to go there, as he is fixated on collecting the tickets. Not because he wants to trade them in for trinkets at the desk on the way out, but because he is obsessed with the tickets themselves.  He's happy spending hours in there.  We always need a strong motivator to get him to leave this place without creating a big scene. What is it that enables Buddy Boy to sometimes put up with horrendous amounts of noise at one time, yet to be in physical pain from lesser amounts of noise at others? There must be a research study in there somewhere.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/01/noise-part-1.html", "title": "\nNoise-Part 1\n"},

He shares this classroom with a few other students, who all get at least some inclusion in regular classrooms. It's only been about 6 weeks since he was spending half of his time in this class and half of his time in a school for emotionally disturbed children (he is autistic, and NOT emotionally disturbed). Well he just brought home his first report card for this year. Three things stuck out. First, half of the report card was missing. There was no reporting for half of the subjects. Second, he got marks for a class he didn't attend (Music). And finally, in Art he was marked as \"lacking creativity\". Well that one just chapped my backside. My son may not be as compliant as they would like. He may butt in to tell the teacher what he knows about a subject. And he may spend recess outside walking the fence looking for worms or spider eggs. But one thing he's got in spades is creativity. This is something that Buddy Boy was building this afternoon, and is typical of some of the stuff he builds, although he often builds stuff that is much more complex, with levers that he fashions that interact with and move other things in his creations.  I asked him what this was.  His response?  \"It's the entrance to my hideout\". \"Once you get past the towers, you get to the gate\". \"Then, when you push the code in-don't tell anyone the secret code, Dad...\" (demonstrates tapping a series of blocks in a specific order while making a beeping sound) \"...the gate slides this way and you can get in to the hideout\". Perhaps this isn't their cookie cutter idea of creativity.  But I'll take Buddy Boy's creativity over their's, any day of the week.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RcaUCWnvIII/AAAAAAAAAAs/0YWx6KjJCqI/s1600-h/P2040210_edited.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RcaY92nvIKI/AAAAAAAAABE/xZSXnCkPQ2E/s1600-h/P2040215.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RcaaDWnvILI/AAAAAAAAABQ/wTp9e9kSQSg/s1600-h/P2040214.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/Rcaaf2nvIMI/AAAAAAAAABc/to4ExZC7Qeo/s1600-h/P2040212.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RcabX2nvINI/AAAAAAAAABo/rf9XUHiDv-Q/s1600-h/P2040213.JPG"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/02/lacks-creativity.html", "title": "\nLacks Creativity\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 3, 2007", "body": "\n Although it's a bit cold in the middle of the US right now, the last few days have been sunny. If left to his own devices, Buddy Boy would spend the majority of his time in his room building things.  He just loves to build.  Towers, water treatment plants, houses for animals to live in, garbage dumps.  He builds with blocks, magnet sets, K'nex, and Tinkertoys.  He is most prolific (and creative) when using paper and tape.  He's made space suits and sea scapes from just white paper and tape. We love that he loves to build, and we encourage it (as well as play with him and encourage him to  play with his younger sister, Sweet Pea).  Bu we also like to get him out doing more active things, for physical exercise and coordination (which he has some issues with), as well as for the whole socialization aspect of it (working with a group, taking directions, interacting with peers).  As his school thus far has not seen fit to provide him with any inclusion, we think it's even more important that we provide some. Buddy Boy has historically not been really happy partaking in group activities, or even individual sports type activities.  Oh, he'll go on a bike ride with me with some cajoling, and sometimes even willingly, but it's far from a preferred activity.   Swimming lessons and gymnastics are even tougher.  Presently he's only in a Saturday morning swim class, and no gymnastics at the moment (due to no current class fitting his schedule).  Once we get him going with these activities, he's usually OK (partaking for significant portions of the class, only occasionally having to sit out portions of the class in order to regroup).  But the first time he goes to one of these activities is usually frought with moderate to major resistance on Buddy Boy's part.  Reaction on his part usually involves such comments as \"What were you thinking?  How could you do something like this to me?  You're so mean to me\".  Of course, once the class is over he's usually OK with having gone to it.  And sometimes even admits it was fun. Experience has taught us that the best way to introduce an activity like this is not to start talking about it days ahead of time, but instead to just introduce the idea 30-45 minutes ahead of time.  So Liz signed up Buddy Boy for a class at a local \"kiddie gym\".  This place is run by an OT who runs several classes throughout the week.  Many kids on the spectrum take these classes, but there are also several NT kids in her classes. Well, Liz picked up Buddy Boy from school yesterday, and gave firm instructions to Sweet Pea beforehand not to announce it to Buddy Boy (as she would have almost certainly said something in a sing song voice like \"You're going to the kiddie gym, and you're not going to like it\").  So Liz announces to Buddy Boy, \"I've got a surprise for you!  You're going to the kiddie gym today for a class!\".  And Buddy Boy said... \"OK\". And he went, didn't have big problems with separation, and participated in the majority of the class without a problem. Sometimes the littlest of things can make your day sunny.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RcToeGnvIGI/AAAAAAAAAAY/5jP2A-I8z1M/s1600-h/sunny+house.jpg"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/02/sunny-day.html", "title": "\nA Sunny Day\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 2, 2007", "body": "\n I've really got nothing personal against Jo Frost, the person who plays \"Supernanny\" on  the ABC show  of the same name here in the US (UK readers can find her  here ).  But after watching a few episodes of the show, I've got to say that I just can't stomach it anymore. Yes, I know, it's only a TV show and entertainment and all.  Don't take it so seriously, Joe.  But it just seems to me that \"Supernanny\" represents a lot of things that just aren't true, at least not in my world.   According to the \"Supernanny\" website: ...Jo Frost, as Supernanny, can tame the wildest toddler, soothe the savage six-year-old and get the most difficult child to overcome problems with behavior, sleep, mealtime, potty training and other challenges that have vexed parents around the world for centuries. ... Well isn't that just great.  And she gets it done every week in 60 minutes (42 minutes not counting commercials)! The world of \"Supernanny\" does not allow for kids on the autism spectrum.  And the way I read the world of the \"Supernanny\": -All kids behavior disorders are due to their parents bad parenting (do I hear echoes of the \"refrigerator mother\" hypothesis here?).   -All of these behaviors are simple to correct. -If you've tried correcting your kids behaviors and haven't been successful, then you're either a) not trying hard enough, or b) still a bad parent. As a family we're fairly successful in helping Buddy Boy self regulate his behaviors.  He's made great gains over the last couple of years.  It's slow, but when I look back at how he interacted with people two years ago and how he does now, he's really come a long way.  In fact, the only place where their still seem to be major behavioral issues is at school.  Not at home, not at gymnastics, not at swimming, not at church services.  Hmmmm. Yet, when we talk to the \"experts\" at school, they blather on about perhaps we should be trying positive feedback, negative consequences, time outs, star charts, etc., etc.  I can't help but think that they've been conditioned by the \"Supernanny\" to believe that my son has a behavioral or emotional disorder, and not a sensory processing disorder, and inherent emotional regulation problems directly related to his autism and ADHD.  And, of course, that we are just  Bad Parents . And then of course there's the fact that he  ONLY  \"misbehaves\" at school.  When I bring this up to them, they just can't process that, and never directly respond.  I'm sure they don't believe me. Does \"Supernanny\" make shows about dysfunctional autism experts at schools that need to be reigned in?  If she would do that, I might just tune in again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XBmaV5nMqhQ/RcOqPmnvIFI/AAAAAAAAAAM/o7vjHm4OE5U/s1600-h/nanny.jpg", "http://abc.go.com/primetime/supernanny/index?pn=about", "http://www.supernanny.co.uk/"], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/02/why-i-hate-supernanny.html", "title": "\nWhy I hate \"The Supernanny\"\n"},
{"date": "Friday, January 26, 2007", "body": "\nCLUB- 1) A group of people united by a common interest or goal. 2) An association to promote good fellowship or social intercourse. The most quoted estimate of the incidence of autism spectrum disorders is 1 in 166. My name is Joe. I live with my family in an inner ring suburb of a mid-sized Midwestern City in the U.S. I officially joined the \"Families Directly Affected by Autism\" club in October of 2004, when our son was diagnosed with PDD-NOS, a type of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). My wife Liz and I had actually joined it when our son was born in 2000, we just didn't realize it at the time. Our son, who I'll refer to as \"Buddy Boy\" as that's what I often call him, exhibited many of the typical signs of autism as he grew. He didn't have any words at all at 24 months. Which isn't to say that he was unable to communicate. He \"spoke\" sentences with one syllable: Dih. \"Dih dih dih dih dihdihdihdihdih\". He repeated it as many times as necessary, raising and lowering the pitch, until he got his point across. He also spun a lot, flapped his hands, and played atypically with his toys (for example, taking things apart and building other things, which weren't necessarily recognizable as anything in particular, with the parts). He was also generally affectionate with us, and had an explosion of language from 28-36 months. Buddy Boy received speech therapy and Occupational Therapy for what we were told was Sensory Integration Disorder. When his language took off I remember thinking \"At least he doesn't have autism\". I have felt somewhat guilty about thinking that ever since, as I have discovered that dealing with autism isn't the terrible burden I imagined it would be, and having autism definitely doesn't mean that one is destined to have an unfulfilled life. Buddy Boy has a sister, Sweet Pea, who is 4 1/2 years old, and other than being a little hyper, is totally neurotypical. I think the opening line of Dickens' \"A Tale of Two Cities\" best explains what it's like to raise a child with autism-\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\". Many people see some of the outward signs of autism-lack of or atypical verbal communication, screaming or tantrums with sensory overload, general lack of eye contact, etc.-and either pity you that your life must be miserable, or give you the evil eye like you're a terrible parent that can't discipline your child. They almost never see the connections that you do make with your child, enjoy some of the great (and funny) things they create, or appreciate that you have most of the \"normal\" joys and sorrows that come with parenting any child. Although dealing with ignorant attitudes in public can be somewhat troubling, our greatest trials have come with dealing with the school system. Buddy Boy is very intelligent, and can go on for great lengths of time expounding on such things as volcanoes or what components make up a water treatment plant (when he drew a diagram of a plant and identified one layer in a sedimentary pool as alum I had to look it up to check it out-he was right). He also clears his throat and grunts a lot (an involuntary tic that has been described in school records as making \"rude sounds\"), also has ADHD (which makes him butt into conversations a lot and try to monopolize them), and tends to perseverate over, and fixate on, small details (for instance he'll decide that he needs to study dust mites, so he'll start collecting loads of dust and won't let us throw it away). He also can be somewhat confrontational (usually verbally, but at times physically) when he doesn't get his way. Some of Buddy Boy's teachers and school administrators have identified him as non-compliant, and have worked actively to get him thrown out of school, rather than actively working to keep him included. Many of the blogs regarding raising kids on the autism spectrum are written by women. A few are written by men. Many of both are excellent, and I've followed many as they also walk this same path that we do. I've decided to add one more blog to the estimated 60 million other blogs out there. Even if no one else reads this, I know it will make me feel better to get some of my thoughts out there, and I think it's helpful to have another male perspective on the subject. So pull up a seat and sit a while. I don't plan on publishing something daily. More like once or twice a week. I also haven't figured out how to do the RSS feed thing, or even how to attach pictures yet. Perhaps in time I'll have a snazzy look to the place.  Until then, this is it.  Like a good movie, the story will have to carry me.  It certainly won't be my writing or presentation skills.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/01/under-construction.html", "title": "\nIntroduction\n"}
