I guess all of that is coming up now in my sub-conscious, because last night I dreamed I was at my future retreat, but a former teacher was hovering nearby. I came to understand she was using my writing for her students to workshop. All kinds of boundaries were crossed and I felt there was little to nothing I could do about it. \n \n \nThen, I spotted on an end table, a book I'd apparently written,  Leaving the Sandlot . I could see the white jacket, the blue lettering, my name on the spine. \n \nI woke up and repeated the title in my head a few times, so I wouldn't forget. Such a weird title. A sandlot? My only familiarity with that word is with some kids' movie, made before I was even a parent, and taking place before I was even born. \n \n \nMaybe the message is in the word \"leaving.\" \n \nMaybe the message is in the definition of sandlot: a piece of unoccupied land used by children for games. \n \nMaybe the message is in the combo, moving away from that which is unoccupied. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2017/06/leaving-sandlot.html", "title": "\nLeaving the Sandlot\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, June 13, 2017", "body": "\nWil turns 21 a month from tomorrow. Plans are underway for a big backyard party (if you'd like to come, consider yourself invited). As was the case when he was turning 18, I felt the need to celebrate, to usher in the milestone with hoopla and fanfare, and rejoice. \n \nSlim to no chance he will partake in alcohol, on his birthday or otherwise. I'll get back to you whether or not he begins taking the wine at communion. This birthday has nothing to do with his legal right to buy or consume alcohol. \n \n\"I'm in my early 20's,\" he said to me, yesterday. At first I thought that came out of nowhere, but then realized we'd been previously discussing how old the others were in his music class. His friend, Timmy, had said, \"I think the average age is 30.\" \n \nWil, Timmy and I have a standing Monday date. We pick up Timmy around 9:30, give or take, and go to a convenience store of Wil's choosing. Then, there is usually another random store picked out for a random reason, then we go to lunch at... a random restaurant. Then, we go to their class, and while they are otherwise engaged for one hour, I sip on an iced decaf latte and read a good book. I drink deeply from the latte, the literature, and the quiet, because then it's back in the car with two boys that both want to tell me different things at the same time, and I carry on two parallel conversations and my mind nearly explodes in a matter of minutes. \n \nYesterday, the random store was Target. We all know I'm a big fan of Target, and couldn't help but feel that Wil was throwing me a bone. They shopped for the things that matter to them: Wil, snacks, Timmy, Legos. I shopped for the things that \"matter\" to me: compostable garbage bags, an inkjet, and throw pillows. The rule is they have to stick together, and keep their phones on. We text each other with updates, and select a time to meet at the check stands. \n \nWhen I got to the check stands, Timmy had already checked out. Wil was standing there, looking a bit lost and confused. He'd checked out, but hadn't paid. He got all the way through before realizing he had no money on him. He explained that his mom was in the store and would be there in a minute to pay, and I was, and I did. \n \nBut. How did he not get that you have to both  have \u00a0money and  enough ? I'd stopped having him carry a wallet when he lost it for the millionth time. Instead, I send him out into the world with a Ziploc with just enough to get what he \"needs,\" but not enough to devastate him when and if he loses it. Because we were together and that wasn't the plan for them to check out without me, I hadn't done that. He had not processed that, and I was startled to realize the utter lack of awareness around that. \n \nLater, when I went to get the mail, he'd received something from the circuit courts. I opened it after Timmy left, and saw that he'd been summoned for jury duty,  on \u00a0his 21st birthday. I read through the list of justifiable excuses, and no where was an option for disability. Instead, there was information about accommodations made for those with disabilities, specifically, mobility, vision or hearing. \n \nNo amount of accommodations were going to make Wil jury material. I fired off a letter, attached my Letters of Guardianship, and there's no doubt he will be excused. \n \nI struggle to find that sweet spot between what he  can \u00a0do and what he  should \u00a0do. Too often, I make life easy for him, because it makes it easier for me. \n \nToo many excuses. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2017/06/excused.html", "title": "\nExcused\n"},

The drops freak him out. They sting his eyes, and he has had to be pinned down to get them in, and just thinking about those drops gives us both a jolt of PTSD. \n \nI wanted to both warn him he had an appointment coming up, and not give him too much notice. Fine line. \"I'm looking for a new eye doctor for you,\" I told him in the car a few months ago. \"You are ready for one that treats adults.\" \n \n\"I know who I want!\" he quipped. \n \n\"Oh, yea? Who?\" I asked. \n \n\"Get one that looks like Steve Martin,\" he said. \n \nSomeone that treats his particular eye condition, that is within a few miles of our house, with a kind demeanor, were my requirements, not a Steve Martin look-alike. \n \nTold him on Monday, \"BT dubs, you have an eye appointment on Wednesday.\" \n \nHe started right in with the concern about the drops, and asked that I cancel the appointment. \"CANCEL!\" was his exact word. \n \nWhen I convinced him I was not going to cancel it, he had me swear that  next \u00a0time he had an appointment, I would cancel it. Hoping in two years he'd forget our promise, but knowing he wouldn't, I agreed. \n \nI'm happy to report that he did well, and the eye doctor, although looking nothing like Steve Martin, was a good fit for him. Pretty arrogant and self-satisfied, he was none-the-less just quirky enough to get on board the Wil train, and at one point asked, \"What are we doing here, free-association? Okay, I'm in.\" \n \n\"Where's the movie?\" Wil asked the medical assistant, \"Finding Nemo?\" I don't think he realized that not every eye doctor in the world shows \"Finding Nemo\" for years-on-end, to their patients and long-suffering parents. I have yet to see the movie in its entirety, but I've seen 10-20 minute segments, since it was released on video in the early 2000's. \n \nThis time, the medical assistant had a special technique for installing the drops, and he didn't cry. He didn't kick and scream. No one had to pin him down. He didn't  love \u00a0it, but he did great, and was very pleased with himself for getting through the ordeal with a minimum of drama. \n \n\"You're doing well, you don't have to come back for two more years,\" the doctor said. \n \n\"I'll come back in two years and one month,\" Wil said, getting in the last word, per usual. \n \n\"See you then,\" the doctor said. \n \n\"See you then,\" Wil responded. \n \nSee you later, Nemo. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2017/06/losing-nemo.html", "title": "\nLosing Nemo\n"},

There is a pattern, a rhythm, and tempo to the days, months and years. \n \n \n \nThis morning, I was in prayer and \"heard\" the question, \"Do you have a cross inside?\" I first was confused as to whose voice it was I was hearing. Was it external? Was it my sub-conscious? Was it Mary's? Being the very literal person that I am, I first thought of the crosses I have on the inside of my house. A moment later, I moved to the question of where and what my internal crosses may be. Of course, there are many. Enough to reflect on that question throughout Lent.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nYesterday, I saw my best friend from junior high. We were only active friends for two years, before I moved away. But, those seventh and eighth grade years were biggies, and much of my personal work has come from the effects of those years. Some years of our lives are more concentrated than others, more full of upheaval, change and transition. We move through understanding in stages, and the \"crosses inside\" must be peeled back, layer by careful layer. \n \n \n \nI'm grateful for the both the literal and figurative time and space in which to examine, and re-examine, \u00a0the cross(es) inside.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0JUSkNd21Cg/WLwbmOKfNyI/AAAAAAAABxU/qvIQm1FQacYF0p_7A_atS8QtMSThIT1TwCLcB/s1600/IMG_2583.JPG"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2017/03/good-question.html", "title": "\nGood Question\n"},

And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will\u00a0also be in our troubled world.\" \n \n Etty Hillesum \n \nI decided months ago what I would give up for Lent this year. If anything, it's more of a gift I am giving myself, than a sacrifice. What will be hard is breaking the habit. What will be hard is resisting the urge. What will be hard is the\u00a0 FOMO . \n \nI'm reading the story of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu's week-long communion in Dharamsala,\u00a0 THE BOOK OF JOY . It's an antidote to all the fear and hate that abounds. It restores hope. It is not complicated, we just make it so. Peace begins with us. There is suffering, the First Noble Truth. What we do in response to that suffering, is our choice. If we were to be pierced by an arrow, we would feel pain. To remove the arrow and keep stabbing ourselves with it, would be ridiculous, but mentally, that's what we do. \n \nI'm teaching a little class at church for school-aged kids that are going to be baptized at Easter. We are talking about Lent - a dedicated period of time in which we increase prayer, giving and fasting. Over the years I've fasted from coffee, alcohol, one year I even fasted from Target. This year, I'm going to fast from social media, and with the time I would ordinarily spend on that, attempt to spend that same time in prayer. \n \nWith all that's going on in the world, in this country, and even in my own neighborhood, I am aware just how much I'm taking those \"arrows\" and stabbing myself over and over and over again with them. I am clear that this isn't working, and that if all this turmoil doesn't call me to action, it's wasted turmoil. I know I can't solve all the ills of the world. I know that I can't react and respond to every cause. How and what I do in response, needs greater contemplation. Greater clarity. Greater peace within myself. \n \nFor all of you having a birthday, happy birthday. For all of you posting cute pictures of your kids, pets, vacations and loved ones, know that I \"like\" them.

After several attempts to sit and read, I finally understood it would be most helpful for me to take tiny sips, over a long period of time, rather than one, long gulp. There was a lesson for me in that realization, that applied to so many other areas of my life. The whole idea of forward momentum. The idea of chipping away at something, even if for 5-10 minutes, rather than waiting until I \"have more time.\" Sitting in quiet for three minutes, is better than zero. Reading five pages, consistently, day after day, will put me in the same place - at the end of the book, but probably not at a place of \"completion.\" \n \nLast night, I dreamed I was driving, and the steering wheel completely came off.

I put the car in park, set the emergency brake, and asked the passenger, to please hand me the Leatherman from the glove compartment. \n \nA Ph.D in psychology is not necessary, to understand that at least one meaning of the dream, is to take my hands off the steering wheel, and to ask for help from the \"passenger.\" \n \nYesterday, I had spent six hours with Wil and his buddy, and they were delightful. They were also very chatty. And they spoke to me, concurrently, on (at least) two different topics at all times, while I (not the best driver in the world) was attempting to drive them all over town.

Wil was in the room at the top of the stairs. \"What are you getting?\" he asked. \"Is it easy? Does it need cooking?\" \n \nWhen I answered him that yes, it was easy, and no, it did not require cooking, he said, \"I'm all ears.\" I told him I was going to get myself a glass of wine. \n \n\"I'll get it,\" he said, and ran downstairs, returning with a glass and the bottle. \"I'll pour it, \" he said.

{"date": "Sunday, January 22, 2017", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nI am lucky and proud to call artist\u00a0 Candace Primack , a close friend. Her oldest daughter was in Wil's small afternoon kindergarten class, 15 years ago, and a friendship was born that has grown through the years into something I cherish, deeply. \n \nI have been buying her art for many years, and with each additional piece, my home looks and feels \"better.\" I see new objects and images with time, I develop a relationship with each piece that grounds, comforts, inspires and delights me. \n \nA few months ago, Candace had an open studio event, where people were going from studio to studio to meet local artists and purchase their art. I walked into the studio and saw, probably  not \u00a0for the first time, but for the first time, \"Remember Me.\" It hung high on the wall amidst many others, it was big, beautiful, and spoke loudly, to me. What drew my eye first, was the \"happy cup,\" the red \"cup\" with the \"handle\" and the \"happiness\" coming from it. Few things make me happier than my daily ritual of perfect coffee in the perfect mug. \n \nI made the impulse decision to buy the painting, and Candace and I worked out the arrangements. It wasn't until we took it off the wall and put it into my car, several days later, that she told me the name of the piece, written on the back. \"Remember Me.\" I knew without further explanation, that the \"me\" was me and not anyone else. I knew it in a way that dropped deep, yet was quickly forgotten in the life so many of us have: taking care of others. Between the duties and responsibilities, the day-to-day minutiae that can easily consume our best hours, it is easy to forget, and hard to remember, me. \n \nI was with Candace the night before the Inauguration. We met with two other soul sisters and spent a couple hours in prayer and soulful discussion, about what WE can do, and what we can do. About hate. About love. About fear. About hope. About change. About resistance to change. About challenges. About acceptance. About division. About unity. \n \nThe subject of Candace's art came up, and she reminded me, again, of the name of my new piece. \"Remember ME,\" she emphasized, pointing to me, \"not Remember Me,\" pointing to herself. \n \nI can easily look around and see those that have forgotten everyone but themselves. Those that have no problem remembering to look out for themselves and their self-interests. Can I, though, figure out how to remember myself? To discern what it most important to me, and to concentrate my time, attention and efforts into that, and not spread myself so thinly over everyone and everything that asks me to, that what I most value gets short-changed? \n \nIt's easy to remember all the others that clamor for our attention, \"Remember me! Remember me! Remember me!\" is a silent chant that thrums through our beings. The partners, the spouses, the kids, the pets, the elderly parents, the friends, those in our communities in need of help, our larger communities, our country, our world. All are in need of our love and attention, in a big, big way. That's just a fact and it's never going to change. There is no end to the needs and demands of others. There is no end to the number of people and worthy causes to whom and which we feel called to serve. \n \nFortunately, there is no end to our capacity to love. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VZGlr5CfRzI/WIS2jK9T0cI/AAAAAAAABwM/gKnsH83XZz0HMUm57VJN3cbAoCV6OeUVQCLcB/s1600/_ALM6211.tif.jpeg", "https://canvas.saatchiart.com/art/inside-the-studio/candace-primack"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2017/01/remember-me.html", "title": "\nRemember Me\n"},

First of all, the place was hard to find. The only reason we were going there was because he'd done his research, and they served Tropicana fruit punch from a self-serve dispenser, and what's better than that? The line to order was miserably long. And slow. Lots of little old ladies and their coupons. Lots of inefficiency and disorganization.

I was very optimistic how all that was going to work, how we were going to share time, talent and treasure, until I got chided for using the wrong bathroom. When I looked around the house again, I realized she was right, I'd been using the one near their bedroom, and I hadn't even noticed the one right by ours.  This is never going to work , I decided then and there. \n \nLast night, I was driving with Wil and my friend Kim, and I can only assume her son, Tim, was in the backseat with Wil, but he was uncharacteristically quiet, in the dream. Like I said, I was driving, and that can only mean one thing, I'm bound to get us lost. Kim is a very good driver and navigator, and in the dream she was also trying to help, but I went too far down some weird road, and then couldn't find a place to turn around. \n \nEventually, I turned into some sort of site and made an attempt to turn around but it was impossible. The road ended and the only choice would be to make a jump for it, and try to cross the abyss while flying through the air. Because we were nearly wrapped around a large tree and at a dead stop, there was no way to gain enough momentum to even consider the risky move. \n \nWe were stuck. \n \nWe couldn't go forward and we couldn't go backward. \n \nWe couldn't leap into the unknown. \n \nWe all got out and walked to some building, which turned out to be a lodge of sorts. There were other guests also staying until they could get un-stuck. I was given confusing directions about where to go to reserve a room for the night, how one actually gets out of there, and ended up even further lost and confused. The staircases were \"wrong,\" and unusable. The front desk wasn't where I was told it would be. The route out took two days by foot, led by a man with a cane. \"But I have a car,\" I said, \"what about that?\" \n \nMid-dream the other people I was with switched from Kim and Tim, to my cousins and their families. They seemed to have no problem figuring out a solution to the situation. I could see them down in the lobby making reservations and treating the whole situation like an unexpected vacation. I couldn't even figure out how they got to the lobby from where we were, let alone how they seemed excited about the whole thing. \n \nFinally, I ended up in the side office of a very nice woman, and cried that I had a child with special needs. I didn't have any food he would eat, I couldn't find any restaurants. We were due home and there was no way I could wait until tomorrow to start a two-day, slow walk back. \n \nThe dream ended when I woke up. There was no clear ending. There was no satisfying resolution. There was no disastrous result, either. \n \nSometimes, when you go down a weird road for too long, it's very difficult to find a place to turn around. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2016/09/still-stuck.html", "title": "\nStill Stuck\n"},

Generally, when Wil and this friend, Timmy, make plans, the plans are 99% Wil's plans, and Timmy has to go along for the ride. This time, however, Wil made a stab at being considerate, and suggested we go to New Seasons, and eat outside on the roof, because Timmy had been suggesting that for quite some time. \n \nNew Seasons, for those who don't know, is a high-end grocery store, that happens to have a roof top dining option. While it's been in our neighborhood for almost a year, and I've been there many times, I had not attempted to figure out how the whole buying-your-food-downstairs-and-taking-it-to-the-roof thing, worked. \n \nTo say Wil is neither an adventuresome, nor healthy eater, is an understatement. I didn't know what we'd find there that he would actually eat. Timmy and I settled on build-your-own burritos, and I talked the man behind the counter, into selling us a plain ol' bowl of shredded, seasoned chicken, for Wil to eat. \"Taco,\" as Wil for years has called such meat, was going to be just the ticket. This was going to be the day I high-fived the Universe and reveled in our success at branching out, trying new things, doing something fun and different. \n \nI had hoped to time our trip to New Seasons to avoid the noon-hour rush, but circumstances had us arriving there at exactly that time. \"Circumstances,\" being Wil's random, but hard fast rule that we'd leave the house at 11:51. When we arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn't crowded at all. Then, I remembered seeing all the school buses and back-to-school hubbub in the morning: Portland Public Schools had started up again. \n \nWe got our trays, paid for our stuff, hiked up two flights of stairs, found a great table with a view of the area below, and enjoyed the perfect weather. \n \nFor about 2.5 minutes. \n \nIn his perfect bowl of organic, cage-free shredded chicken, Wil found a tiny bone. \n \nThat was it. He wasn't eating another bite. No amount of combing through the rest of the bowl to prove there were no more bones, that that was not going to happen again, that it wasn't normal to find bones, and was just a fluke, would convince him. \n \nMy bliss was broken. I then became aware that the only other people up on the roof, were moms with toddlers. The table next to us had two women with strollers, their toddlers happily eating all the healthy food they put in front of them, while the women discussed the preschool options in the area. I couldn't help but over-hear. I couldn't help but be wistful. I couldn't help but see that at times, it feels like we're going backwards. \n \nIf not backwards, not forward. Maybe more of a \"Groundhog Day,\" type thing. Stuck. Time marches on around us, and we stay in the same place. \n \nThere is evidence all around us, to the contrary. I know that.

When I am rejoined with my friend, the sky has turned back to day, and I try to convince her it had just been pitch-black a minute ago, I swear. \n \nImmediate thoughts: \n \nI was only going to be able to help for 25 minutes, anyway, so what's the big deal? \n \nWhat's up with the sky dramatically, and unpredictably changing? \n \nWhat's up with it only being me that saw the sudden shifts? \n \nWhen did I learn to levitate, and why can't I do it all the time? \n \n\"Deep\" thoughts: \n \nLife can look dark, then suddenly, the sun comes out. And vice-versa. \n \nWe don't need other people to see what we see, experience what we experience, to make it true. \n \nThings change. \n \nGetting up and over the tricky parts of life (levitating) is the key. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Levitaatio.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2016/05/levitating.html", "title": "\nLevitating\n"},

I had two outside planters with not-thriving plants in them, and was going to re-plant with thriving plants. Moving the planters from the front to back, where I'd have a hose, and a working surface, and the new plants, seemed hard. The planters were heavy. Tried moving the new plants and all the stuff to the front, but was making such a mess, decided to go back to Plan A. Got a little make-shift cart from the garage to help transport the planter. Tried pulling it. Didn't work. Tried pushing it, worked, until it didn't, and we hit a change in elevation on the driveway, and the cart, with increased velocity due to the incline, sent the planter straight into my shin. \n \nHurt like hell and my first thought was  how irritating. \u00a0Looked down, and there was huge swelling and bruising, instantly. Walking was painful. The sheer speed and size of the swelling scared me. The rest of the day's plans were scraped, and I spent as much time as possible, elevating and icing it. \n \nWil really \"needed\" to go to Bi-Mart and get the one thing from \"our\" list he had forgotten the day before, from \"our\" very important list.

We all had our favorites, we remember which ones were \"worth\" $1,000,000 one time when we \"owned\" them. We remember which ones, despite the odds, frequently were forgeries. We remember when I mis-pronounced \"forgery\" and said, \"fogery,\" and we remember how we've never let that joke die. \n \nWe taught our own kids to love the game, and have fun playing it wherever we're together. Somewhere along the line, we picked up extra games at garage sales, and each of us \"kids\" have our own game. When my mom moved from her house in Sisters, I donated the game to the thrift store. My aunt went to that very thrift store, and bought that very game, not knowing it was her sister that had donated it. When we helped my aunt to clean out her house before moving, I ended up back with the exact game I'd donated, originally. \n \nYesterday, was Woohoo's 22nd birthday. Her college graduation was the day before. Lots to celebrate and appreciate - much gratitude to be given for her, her birth, her accomplishments, and all that lies before her. We ended the evening with a game of Masterpiece. \n \nThe round of Masterpiece was a metaphor for each of our personalities: STM broke all the rules, he went for broke, he was able to completely detach from what the paintings looked like, and focus only on what they were worth to him. He brokered deals. He made the game his own, and unsurprisingly, won the game by having over a million dollars more than the runner-up. \n \nI came in last place. I played conservatively. I followed the rules to a T. I bought and sold paintings based on emotion and connection, or lack thereof, to the painting. I played the game the same way I've been playing it for 40 years. \n \nThe values of the paintings are in one pile, and the paintings in another. Each new game the piles get shuffled, and are paired \"randomly.\" There is no question that STM and I have been in \"the game\" before.

Sure enough, there was one car in the fast lane, that was coming toward us, not driving ahead of us. I first saw the headlights, thought that was weird, then tried to get back to my other problem at hand. But a few seconds later, another car's headlights approached, and then another.

They have many mutual friends, and have been able to do outings, without me, that are age-appropriate, fun, and are giving Wil independence skills. He's learned to use a wallet (and has only left it behind once, where Michael quickly retrieved it, fully intact). He's ridden bikes, walked, hopped on the bus and light rail, as well as taken Michael's or others cars all over town, including downtown. His horizons have been broadened, his pallet expanded, his comfort-zone stretched. \n \nMichael, unfortunately, is leaving for college soon, and we will be adjusting to a different PSW or two. We have two wonderful ones in mind, and I'm certain others will be \"there\" when we need them, too. \n \nSimultaneously, I've moved into a personal support worker role for my mother-in-law. She, too, needs help with activities of daily living and community inclusion. She, too, needs someone to be her second pair of ears, to hear/interpret/feed back to and help form appropriate responses. She, too, needs someone being the second pair of ears to make sure the wallet comes with us, stays in our possession, and is returned to a safe place when we get her back home. She, too, needs someone to do the driving, the arranging, the making-it-all-happen. \n \nThat's the circle of life, isn't it? We go from dependent, to some level, ideally, of independence to dependent again. I know there are spiritual lessons intrinsic in the recognition of that circle, the acceptance, the hopping on and off of it when it's our turn to be helped, and be of help, and back around again. \n \nIt helps to detach from all outcomes, to simply show up, be a support \"worker\" of the personal kind, and have no expectations of \"results,\" or effectiveness. It stretches one's definition of what true support is and isn't, what is \"personal\" and what is simply a matter of pertinent fact, and what is \"work\" and what is simply love.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2015/08/personal-support-worker.html", "title": "\nPersonal Support Worker\n"},
{"date": "Monday, June 29, 2015", "body": "\n \n \n \n It is my great and sincere honor to tell you about my friend Tanya's latest book. Tanya's first book,\u00a0 Slip , came out after I'd already become a fan of Tanya's writing, and an appreciator of all the good work she's done to spread awareness on the topics of autism and bipolar disorder. I was given the opportunity to be an early reader of  Enough to Go Around.  The book was sent to me as an e-mail attachment, and I damn near got carpal tunnel from scrolling, scrolling, scrolling for hours on end, as I was unable to \"put it down.\" Below is a short interview I did with Tanya, about her latest work. Enjoy! \n \n TELL ME ABOUT YOUR PROCESS OF WRITING THIS BOOK: \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n Enough to Go Around \nhas been a process of discovery and a labor of love for most of my life. As a\nchild I would go to my paternal grandparents\u2019 home for various holidays, and\nwhile sitting around the dining room table eating traditional Slovakian food I\nwould listen to many stories my grandparents told about their growing up years\nin Czechoslovakia and their immigration experiences. I was intrigued and often\nentertained by these stories, and when I was assigned a genealogy project in\nseventh grade, I brought a tape recorder and a notebook to their house and\nlistened intently while they retold their stories. It was then that the idea of\nwriting a book about them came into being. \n \nYears passed \u2013 worked my way through college, became a\nsingle parent \u2013 and the story began to take shape although there wasn\u2019t much\nwriting time. Characters evolved, a video was given to me of a trip my dad took\nwith his sister to Slovakia, and I borrowed books from my dad to use for\nresearch. My initial idea was to create a fictional account of my grandparents\u2019\nexperiences (because there were a lot of facts and details I didn\u2019t have), but\nI also wanted to weave the stories of the past with a present-day extended\nfamily and everyone\u2019s lives. I spent years jotting down extensive notes and\nwriting at least a dozen different outlines.  \n \nIn 2007 I was blessed to take a trip with my father and my\nsister to Slovakia to do research and meet relatives. It was an amazing and\nemotional time. We saw the villages where both of my grandparents grew up,\nvisited the graves of my great-grandparents, and met relatives we didn\u2019t know\nwe had. \u00a0  \n \nMy life with my two sons, one of whom has autism, influenced\nme to write  Slip , my first novel. I\nset  Enough to Go Around  aside for a\nwhile (which at the time had a different title, one of five over the years). My\nlife was deeply entrenched in the world of special needs and that was where my\nmind was for several years, so I focused on that subject matter.  \n \nBut a few years ago I was very happy to get back to the\nstory of my family heritage. I wrote the first full draft during NANOWRIMO in\n2008. Since then it continued to evolve into its present state. I am privileged\n\u2013 and thrilled \u2013 to be able to share it. \n \n \n \n WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT YOUR READERS TO KNOW: \n \n \n \n Enough to Go Around \nfocuses on the theme of family life \u2013 its complexity, troubles, and rewards. I\nwanted to share my family\u2019s heritage, of course, but also other elements of\nlife, such as mistakes, regret, love, loss, and forgiveness. I wanted to foster\nawareness about bipolar disorder, which one of the main characters has, and how\nit can affect family life. For this I draw on my personal experience of bipolar,\nas well as the pain of losing a close family member to cancer, another element\nof the book. (Sadly, my father died of colon cancer in 2011 and did not see\nthis book come to fruition.) Life is messy, families are fragile, and there are\nno easy fixes. But sometimes you can sit around the dining room table at Easter\nand tell jokes and stories and laugh and look around the table and realize that\nyour life may be far from great, it may be really hard at times, but you have\nthese moments to hold onto, these \u2013 and other \u2013 moments of grace that are just\nas much a part of that life, and perhaps even more important. \n \n \n \n Order your copy here! \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MiyFv_ZDTfw/VZHsTGSHezI/AAAAAAAABqU/3CWwM7tomkw/s1600/enoughfront%2Bquote.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/Slip-Tanya-Savko-ebook/dp/B0058UVOSY/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1435627963&sr=1-1&keywords=slip+tanya+savko", "", "http://www.amazon.com/Enough-Go-Around-Tanya-Savko-ebook/dp/B00XONLIGK/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1435552962&sr=1-1&keywords=enough+to+go+around", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4D_tNWt-uhU/VZHsgE5PyAI/AAAAAAAABqc/dNOdiozxEMQ/s1600/Tanya%2BSavko%2Bauthor%2Bphoto.JPG"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2015/06/enough-to-go-around.html", "title": "\nEnough to Go Around\n"},

We had to go every three months, then every six months, eventually every year, and the last time we were there she said we didn't need to come back for two years. \n \nWe've had countless pairs of glasses. I've held him down and forced eye drops into his good eye, to make the weaker eye work harder, a billion brutal times. Three days before Wil's eye appointment he started getting very anxious, \"There are going to be tears! A lot of tears! I am going to cry when they put the eye drops in my eyes!\" \n \nThe whole thing is traumatic and PTSD-causing for all involved. \n \nWe'd had horrible traffic and then she was running behind, so the eye appointment was taking up our whole morning. We'd left our house at 8:15 and Wil \"needed\" to be back to school at 11:00, and it wasn't going to happen. \n \nAnxiety increased. Irritation was high. General I-have-got-to-get-out-of-here was through the roof. For both of us. As I looked around the waiting room of young mothers, young children, toys, videos for preschoolers, I knew that neither of us could take it one more time. We'd originally planned to stay until he was 21, but I knew this would be it. This would be our last visit with our beloved friend and doctor. We were moving on. \n \nEven when it's time.

Because he's so weirdly good at predicting things, I half expect to win. Because I'm so weirdly one to project the smallest thing into an impending catastrophe, I've got myself into a total state of how my life will change for the worse,  when we win the lottery.  Because life is so weirdly full of no accidents, I also know if we are meant to win the lottery, we will, and if we aren't, we won't. \n \nIn the meantime, plans for life inside the RV continue to develop. He will shower at 10:00 PM and go to bed at 11:00. He will watch a lot of bad TV and pretty much do whatever he wants, whenever he wants to do it. He already has a roommate lined up, and they are both super excited to live in the RV, where there are no rules and nothing but all their favorite things in and around it. Plus, Care will be right next door, to \"get it,\" whatever \"it\" is. \n \nThe plan is sounding better and better to me, too. \n \nRV= Real Victory\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2015/05/the-lottery.html", "title": "\nThe Lottery\n"},

Resignation will take you down. Acceptance will lift you up.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThere is nothing more concrete than going through your earthly possessions and physically holding them in your hand, and being lifted up by the understanding that you aren't the same person that first beheld it. \n \n \n \nAs Easter was about to roll around again, Wil started talking about Devohn, the Easter Bunny.

We enjoyed the experience very much, and were excited to stay up late on Holy Saturday, and welcome them into the waters at the Easter Vigil. We went to Bi-Mart and made up little gift bags to give \"our\" kids: a chocolate Cross, Easter candy, and a toy Devohn for each one. \"I need to have a Devohn, too,\" Wil said. So, of course, instead of four Devohns, we bought five. \n \n \n \nWil came home and wrote this note, taping it to the mantle in the living room, just as he does his yearly Santa note (Go to my room top of stairs and say hi to me, Love, Wilson): \n \n \n \n \n \nI sent a text to Devohn's helper, and reminded him that we were expecting him to reappear outside our house, as he had graciously done the year before. I prayed Devohn was still in existence, and easily accessible, as we'd not communicated about this beforehand. Devohn did not disappoint. \n \n \n \n \nNow, each morning, Little Devohn wakes up, goes downstairs, and gets ready for his day while his \"dad\" is at school. Wil gently prepares a few snacks and some entertainment. \"Now, you stay there, Devohn, and wait for me. I'll be back later.

{"date": "Saturday, October 11, 2014", "body": "\n \n \n \nFound this on my windshield after shopping at New Seasons. Actually, that's not exactly true. Found it on my windshield about five miles down the road, after shopping at New Seasons. Almost drove back to see if every car in the parking lot also had one, or if I was special. \n \nI didn't quite know what to make of it. I am not one for evangelizing. I'm not one for trying to convert someone to another way of thinking. I am, however, one for random acts of kindness, and in the end, chalked it up to just that. \n \nIn some ways my life has never been better, and in some ways, it's never been more challenging. I remember being a new mother, and talking to my friend Ruth. Her two girls were just enough older than my two, that she held wisdom I was looking for. I'll never forget what she said, \"At each stage, something gets easier, and something gets harder.\" \n \nI've thought of that over and over through the years, and it's as true in life, as it is in child-raising. It's too easy to focus on what's getting harder, than what is getting easier. Sometimes it requires a step back and a wider view to see that it's even true: something has gotten easier. \n \nToday I found myself with an unexpected free day. Wil got to help at the Snack Shack from 8-2. I didn't know what to do with myself. My mom's birthday is today, and we have plans for Tuesday, when he's in school. But, I decided to call today and offer up breakfast, or coffee, lunch or birthday cake - whatever she wanted. She was enjoying her morning of answering the phone and talking to all the friends and relatives that were calling to wish her a happy birthday, so we agreed that she'd call me later with a time. She did. When I arrived at her house to take her out for dessert, there were two of my cousins and a cousin-in-law. They were just landing in town from Washington, and were quickly stopping on the way to see their mom (my mom's sister). The timing was perfect. One might even say, no accidents. \n \nTwice in the last week, Wil has gone to bed after me. He's turned off all the lights, brushed his teeth, and put himself to bed. \n \nOn Thursday night he rode the rooter bus to a football game, one hour away. He didn't get back until 11:00 PM. \n \nLong shifts helping at a Snack Shack. Rooter buses. Turning lights off. Putting himself to bed. Staying up until after 11:00 PM (second time this school year). All huge. \n \nOne day after school last week, we went to Baskin Robbins for a large milkshake. Seven scoops and 2 cups of milk later, we sat down outside, because the music was way too loud inside. The time before I'd actually spoken up and asked if they could turn it down a little, and they did, but this time, I opted for the path of least resistance. \n \nThe only other woman in the shop, left her inside table, and joined us outside. There weren't even tables, just chairs in a line. \"It's SO loud in there. Do you mind if I join you? I didn't even realize there were chairs outside!\" \n \nWhat started as a surface conversation, \"Do you live around here?\" quickly turned to the fact that she has turned her house into a group home, and manages the care of two adults (34 and 53) with developmental disabilities. Both of these adults came to her through unusual circumstances, she wasn't even considering running a group home, but it evolved. She felt called to do the work after one friend could no longer care for her daughter, and from that she became an advocate. She, at mid-life, knowing nothing about disabilities or social services, has become an expert. She thought she'd enjoy being an empty nester, maybe travel or pursue a hobby. Instead, she found her true calling. \n \nThere are random notes left on car windshields, then there are kindnesses that make one a living saint. \n \nWhile it's true that at each stage something gets easier, and something gets harder, it is also true that there are helpers all along the way. Some small, windshield-type helpers, and some that will turn their lives upside down just to do what needs to be done. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b-5a9ufRXkU/VDnT1m1AC4I/AAAAAAAABio/0oDDA6i0cVA/s1600/sc0028d8cc.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2014/10/helpers.html", "title": "\nHelpers\n"},

Flicka has been trained to walk on the left, and Missy/Melissa, on the right. We get our pace set; one that works for a big dog with a slower pace, and a littler dog with a faster one. The dogs do their thing, and we do ours, falling quickly into deep conversation, skipping entirely over the chit-chat phase. This is one of my favorite things about my time with Candace, it nourishes me at my very roots. \n \nAt the end of our walk I said to her, \"Now, go into your studio and paint something beautiful.\" \n \n\"You go to your computer and write something that makes me laugh,\" she countered. \n \nSo, given that task, I will tell you about my earlier morning power struggle with Wil. Ever since I replaced my 17-year-old CR-V with a new CR-V, we've had an on-going issue over the heating and cooling system. Wil used to always ride in the back seat of my car, but when I got the new car, we made the switch to him in the passenger seat. I should have, but didn't, foresee the endless frustration on both our parts, with all the knobs and opportunities to fidget, with the new car. He is at it non-stop. \n \nI thought the solution was inherent in the design of the car: dual-control. There is a button that says, \"Sync\" and when it's depressed, the driver's knob controls the whole car, but when the passenger side is adjusted by, oh, say, a passenger, then it's get \"un-synced.\" Perfect, right? The passenger can be as warm or as cold as said passenger would like to be, while the driver can be fully independent from the whims of the passenger. \n \nHowever. \n \nWil is not content just moving his knob back and forth a million times in the 10-minute drive to school, he wants to control mine, too. \"DON'T TOUCH MY DIAL!\" I shout each day. He vacillates between freezing me out and making my menopausal body sweat to death, and today, I was in no mood for it. None. \n \nHe'd already spent the better part of last night and this morning Googling a specific type of bubble gum (Extra/Classic), and giving me careful instructions as to where and when we would be purchasing this gum, for his new best friend. \n \n\"If you touch my dial ONE MORE TIME, we will NOT stop and get the gum,\" I said. \n \nWe all know what he did. \n \nI did not stop. \n \nHe did not stop. \n \nHe lectured me for the remaining ride on his rights to adjust the dial anytime and anyway he sees fit, as the car is not all mine, it's his, too. Nothing is all mine. \n \nTruer words were never spoken. \n \nNothing is all mine. \n \nNot the power. \n \nNot the control. \n \nIt's dual. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2014/09/dual-control.html", "title": "\nDual-Control\n"},

Everyone needed something and they needed it all at the same time. I put over 80 miles on my car just putting out fires. \n \nIt's been years since anyone asked me what I do for a living, but three people have asked me in the last week.

Later, Wil's former Resource Room teacher and her darling husband and child (Wil's goddaughter), came over for Beer O'Clock.

Ian did not take Wil to the prayer service because Ian was dying to get up before 6:00 on his last day of summer, he took Wil to the prayer service because Wil wanted to go to the prayer service. Wil did not want his mother taking him (and his mother was good with that), he wanted to go with friends, just like all the other seniors. And so, Ian took both Wil and his long-time friend, Jack. That's just a tiny example of the kid Ian is. Ian would no doubt be a stellar human regardless of whether or not Wil came into his life at the young age of barely five.

{"date": "Thursday, July 31, 2014", "body": "\nWe are moving right along with attaining guardianship. I say \"we\" but mean \"I.\" Only one person can be named guardian, and if/when I am no longer able to perform the duties, the whole long, arduous, expensive process begins all over again. \n \nBefore a child turns 18 a parent can name a guardian in their will, and subsequent guardians, should the need ever arise. For whatever reason, one cannot do that after the \"child\" is 18. I will be awarded guardianship of the person I've been taking care of 24/7 for 18 years, but cannot legally name my successor. \n \nAnyway. \n \nI dreaded the arrival of the processor, the person that would come at an appointed time and hand Wil a stack of papers and let him know he was being officially \"served.\" That whole thing took less than 2 minutes and the woman could not have been any kinder. Nonetheless, the emotional toll was high and began months (years) ago in anticipation of all that it represented. \n \nThe next \"ordeal\" I fretted about was the court visitor. We were to expect someone to come to the house and \"vet\" us, for lack of a better word. Wil had to be there, I had to be there, and so I decided STM had to be there, too. Again, the nicest woman came at the appointed time. She was respectful, natural, kind, and only asked Wil a handful of questions. \"I don't have any more questions for you, do you have any more for me?\" she asked. He indicated no, and then she asked, \"Is it OK if I ask your parents some more questions?\" He then went upstairs and she quietly, graciously, asked us a few more questions. She wasn't in our house more than 25 minutes. \n \n\"Technically, I'm supposed to ask a whole bunch more questions, but I thought they'd confuse and upset him, and it's clear to me that guardianship is appropriate,\" she said. She is a psychologist who has done this for years. \"They send us out on each and every case because every once and awhile there is a need to protect someone for whom guardianship is  not \u00a0appropriate.\" \n \nWe received word that her vetting was complete, she had obtained information from our primary care doctor, our behavioral/developmental pediatrician and a few others; all in full support of me being Wil's legal guardian. \n \nIt's a weird thing to feel like you \"won,\" something that is so obvious, so necessary, so matter-of-fact. It's a weird thing to celebrate that your child is so disabled that everyone can see he is so disabled. It's a weird thing to be glad you \"get\" to keep doing what you've always been doing. \n \nAnd yet, I have won. \n \nAnd yet, I am celebrating. \n \nAnd yet, I am glad. \n \nThere is a peace prevailing that has not been around for at least a full year. Now I am \"this\" close to obtaining guardianship. I have a stack of documents 8\" high that I will take to my Social Security appointment on Tuesday. Included in the stack is a letter from Wil's behavioral/developmental pediatrician explaining her recommendation that I not take him to his own appointment. I have been filled with angst over that damn appointment for months, but now that it's five days away, I'm very calm. \n \nIt's so true that the fear of it, is way, way, way worse than the reality of it. Maybe it's just the way grief works, another layer is peeled back and you are exposed and vulnerable, and then you motor through until it's all swept into the cog of your normal. Not everyone's normal, but yours. Your different, but very much OK normal. Your normal that is normal if you stop comparing yourself, your child, your life to anyone and everyone else's. Your normal that is not going anywhere, so you might as well embrace it and get on with it.

I just received it, because it was a phone session with\u00a0 Pat Longo . Pat is a gifted teacher and healer, who is booked six months out. She is perhaps most famous for being a mentor and healer for\u00a0 Theresa Caputo , the Long Island Medium. \n \nPat and I had an hour together on the phone. She diagnosed me as an empath. \"Google ' Traits of an Empath '\" she said. And so, I did. Yepperdo. I'm an empath. \n \n\"Did you suffer from anxiety as a child?\" \n \n\"Do you walk into a room and immediately know what mood everyone is in?\" \n \n\"Are you exhausted after being in a crowd?\" \n \n\"Do you frequently have a sense of deja vu or synchronicities?\" \n \n\"Do you dream lucidly and vividly?\" \n \n\"Do you just  know \u00a0things?\" \n \n\"Do you suffer from digestive troubles?\" \n \n\"Have you ever had migraines?\" \n \n\"Are you extremely affected by sounds, sights and smells?\" \n \n\"Is it unbearable for you to watch violence or cruelty on TV? Do you feel as though it's happening to you?\" \n \nShe suggested many strategies to help me both develop my own psychic abilities, as well as to ward off unwanted energies. \"Do you know those big belts that professional wrestlers wear? I want you to visualize yourself putting one on each morning, right around your solar plexus, under the rib cage and above the navel.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShe taught me an exercise called Ground and Surround, in which you visualize yourself in a bubble of pure white light. That's surround. Then you visualize white cords of light coming from your heels and tailbone, growing deep into the earth and wrapping around a tree at the very center. That's ground. \n \n \n \n\"Six seconds for the whole thing. Try it every single morning and all your physical ailments will go away.\" \n \n \n \nShe concluded the session by doing a long-distance healing with me. We were both silent, eyes closed, for just a few minutes. I got an intense sense of being whirled around on a merry-go-round at a park. I could see the colors spinning by and could feel the clockwise motion. I told her that when she was done. \"That's exactly what I did. I very quickly did a healing that cleared everything from every part of your body. Clockwise.\" \n \n \n \nSo.

{"date": "Friday, June 27, 2014", "body": "\n Part \u00a0of my blog inertia is due to the fact that in a little over two weeks, Wil will turn 18. I have been in a huge funk over this for quite some time, fear and dread dating back to 2012, at least. I don't  want  to\u00a0apply for SSI, Medicaid, or brokerage services. I don't  want \u00a0to hire an attorney and basically sue Wil for guardianship, so that the day  after \u00a0he's 18, I will do the exact same thing as I've done the last 18 years, which is to say, pretty much everything. \n \n\"The reason guardianship is such a big deal,\" our attorney told us, to the tune of $400/hour, \"is because people have abused it. The laws are set up to protect people. Second only to being incarcerated, guardianship strips an individual of his/her civil liberties.\" \n \nI'm all for protecting the most vulnerable population. I'm all for civil liberties. I'm all for everything I'm supposed to be all for, but key-rist, arranging to have your \"adult\" child served papers, being vetted to prove you are not out for their \"money,\" paying through the nose and filling out reams of paper, is just not my idea of a good time. \n \nI could go on and on about the bureaucracy of the government, the endless red tape and tail-chasing, but you probably already know all you need to know about that. What I will tell you about, instead, is about the angels among us. \n \nI called to schedule an 18-year well-check with Wil's doctor. I was greeted on the phone by such a competent and kind woman, whom arranged to speak to Wil to get his verbal OK, that I could speak in his behalf until the guardianship paperwork came through. She was sensitive. She was efficient. It was, dare I say, easy. \n \nFueled by the success of that phone call, I called Aging and Disabilities Services to have a couple questions answered. Got voicemail, left a message, did not expect to hear back. Lo and behold, Michelle called back, was gracious, full of helpful information, then later called me back again because she thought of something she forgot to tell me, that might be helpful. It was. \n \nFeeling like I was on a roll, I pushed it further. I called Social Security to get an appointment. Yes, I was on hold for a full hour, and I heard the automated message no fewer than 60 times, but I had a cold beer and several days' worth of Facebook to catch up on, so all was not lost. Once a live person came on, she, too, was amazingly knowledgeable and helpful. Extremely. \n \nThe next day, feeling like we couldn't lose, I took Wil into the bank to do some necessary things prior to him turning 18.  He \u00a0was cooperative, and the teller was amazing. Turns out we needed to fill out quite a bit of paperwork. \"Why don't you go across the street and get frozen yogurt. I'll fill it out for you.\" We did just that. We sat in the sun and enjoyed a lovely treat, and when we went back, the paperwork was complete. \n \nThere is no getting  around \u00a0the brutal maze of a disabled child becoming a disabled adult, but there is a way  through,  and that is with the help of many, many angels, both seen and unseen. And to all of you out there praying for us, thank you, those prayers are felt and much appreciated. \n \nLove. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2014/06/angels-among-us.html", "title": "\nAngels Among Us\n"},

Well, let me tell you, when my friend,\u00a0 Elizabeth Aquino \u00a0published her memoir,  Hope for a Sea Change , I started singing a different tune. Sure, \"we\" have an iPad, but \"we\" aren't very good about sharing it, as in, I can not so much as glance its way without Wil freaking out.

This woman does NOT experience blog inertia the way I do from time-to-time, she is a prolific writer, and I've loved being a fly on her wall as she raises her three children in Los Angeles. I love reading about Henry and Oliver, The Brothers. I love reading about the tremendous cakes she bakes (she's a former pastry chef). I love reading about what she's reading about. But most of all, I love reading about her now 19-year-old daughter, Sophie, whom suffers from a complex seizure disorder.  Hope for a Sea Change \u00a0is a memoir of Elizabeth's journey through diagnosis, understanding, and a new understanding of healing. \n \n \n \n \nElizabeth has educated, uneducated and re-educated me about the benefits of medical marijuana. I went from thinking I knew what it was and wasn't, learning I knew nothing at all, to learning a modicum of the profound benefits of high CBD, low THC marijuana for patients with epilepsy. I learned all about the\u00a0 Realm of Caring , and\u00a0 Charlotte's Web. \n \n \n \n(Early November 2013/January 2014) \n \n \n \nThe memoir will make you shake your head at What People Say. It will make you ache for the torture Sophie and her family have endured. And it will make you smile deep within yourself as you read, \"... it would fundamentally change the way I looked at Sophie's disability, at the integrity of human beings, and at what healing and curing really mean.\" \n \nElizabeth has done much through the years to reshape what I think about things politically, poetically and philosophically. Her memoir will most definitely affirm the integrity of  all  human beings. \n \n \n \n \nAvailable on\u00a0 SheBooks \u00a0and\u00a0 Amazon \u00a0for e-readers (only $2.99). \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9R6GFPSdlLU/U5TypPckvVI/AAAAAAAARco/-sfjY5oty8E/s1600/HopeforSeaChange.jpeg", "http://elizabethaquino.blogspot.com/", "http://elizabethaquino.blogspot.com/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gb5_LKeFJhM/U5chNoTc4sI/AAAAAAAARcw/RokEZKkhQ9o/s1600/Me+and+Sophie.jpg", "http://theroc.us/", "https://theroc.us/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=57&Itemid=388", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CElnUOroems/U6r57D2Q56I/AAAAAAAABec/sZeZeoOEMl0/s1600/Before+Cannabis+Photo+of+Sophie.jpeg", "http://www.shebooks.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Aquino-crop.jpg", "http://www.shebooks.net/book/ebook/hope-for-a-sea-change/9781940838489#.U6or-xx3UpQ", "http://www.amazon.com/Hope-Sea-Change-search-healing-ebook/dp/B00KV98E6W"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2014/06/hope-for-sea-change.html", "title": "\nHope for a Sea Change\n"},

Rena is the author of\u00a0 Magic : The Crest . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHow impressed are you that a fourth grader has written and published a book? I know. She tagged me in a blog tour, you can read all about it\u00a0 here. \u00a0Because I know all of you are busy and most of you have been tagged in blog tours already, I am going to make this voluntary. If any of you would like to participate, please do! Thank you! \n \n \n \nBelow are my responses to Rena's questions: \n \n \n \n WHAT AM I WORKING ON?  Since\u00a0my book came out in early 2013, I have been having a lot of fun promoting it in various ways. I've done a lot of book groups, a bookstore event, a couple fund-raisers, and I have a reading at a library coming up. I was asked to join a group of retired teachers that do philanthropic work, and that was an honor. I am looking forward to doing an event with\u00a0 Albertina Kerr , an organization devoted to children's mental and developmental health. \n \n \n \n HOW DOES MY WORK DIFFER FROM OTHERS OF ITS GENRE?  Good question! There are a lot of memoirs out there about mothers, in particular, and their autistic children. With the incredible rate at which autism is being diagnosed, and the huge impact it has on families, it's not surprising there are a million memoirs out there on the subject. How my book is different, is that it focuses on my own spiritual evolution through the process, my own \"end\" to suffering, if you will, arriving at a place of acceptance and even gratitude for the life I have - so different from the one I planned. \n \n \n \n WHY DO I WRITE WHAT I DO?  I believe we are all here to teach, that being said, some of us are more effective teachers than others. I believe my son came to teach us how to live without ego, without \u00a0any of the trappings we can so easily get caught up in. He came to teach, by example, a pure and powerful connection to the Divine. Free from all dogma, all fear, all baggage, if you will, he demonstrates a true spiritual connection that is inspirational. \n \n \n \n HOW DOES MY WRITING PROCESS WORK?  Hmmm... that's a tough one. I tend to write in fits and spurts. There are times (wonderful times) when what I write seems to be downloaded - I might be doing some tedious household chore, and all of a sudden a complete blog post or chapter of my book just \"comes\" to me. Other times I fight and fight to keep my butt in the chair and pound it out. I'm not disciplined enough to have a sacred writing time each day that I keep free from other obligations, although when I was working on my book, I would carve out particular hours/days/weekends to go somewhere and work on a particular part of the book. \n \n \n \nI always admire writers that have a routine and firm boundaries around it. I am many things besides a writer, and for me, the writing has to fit in around all of those other responsibilities. \n \n \n \nIf you are a writer and would like to take part in this tour, we'd appreciate it!\u00a0 Courtney Sheinmel? \u00a0 Jenny Rough? \u00a0 Kario? \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://renamarth.wordpress.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Magic-The-Crest-Rena-Marthaler/dp/1494311003/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1397315414&sr=8-1&keywords=Magic+the+Crest", "http://renamarth.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/cropped-8_24_13_ellienickwed_1129.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NAMCcDJCL._SY344_PJlook-inside-v2,TopRight,1,0_SH20_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg", "http://renamarth.wordpress.com/", "http://www.albertinakerr.org/", "http://www.courtneysheinmel.com/", "http://www.jennyrough.com/", "http://the-writing-life.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2014/04/blog-tour.html", "title": "\nBlog Tour\n"},

It was mind boggling to think about, yet, we continued to hold that up as a dream to one day realize. \n \nFast forward to this year. Wil is in a program that is in its third year of operation. The kids he started out with are now juniors - the year the school typically takes kids on the 3-day retreat. The decision was made to take all of the kids in his program on the same retreat, rather than splitting them up throughout the year. It made the most sense to the program to have them all be gone at the same time, and the staff could be made more available to assist if they were all together. \n \nWord caught on that this group would be attending, and spaces quickly filled amongst the \"typicals.\" They knew it would be a unique, once-in-a-lifetime experience. Staff and student helpers were enlisted. I had e-mail exchanges, one-on-one meetings and phone calls for months prior to the retreat. All the what-and-whens were addressed, down to the very last detail. I couldn't have dreamed of better \"customer service.\" I could and would go on and on, but the details of the retreat are to be kept secret and sacred, as to make the experience special for each new group attending. I will leave you with the the simple fact that if I'd made a list of everything he wanted and needed, then padded the list times 10, it wouldn't have come close to how  perfect \u00a0blessed it was. \n \nOne of the very best things about the retreat, was the under-statement of the fact that this was the first one of its kind. Before, during and after, it was not a \"thing.\" 60 juniors went on a retreat, and several of them just happened to have learning differences. It gave me great hope that there is a dawning of a new day. My dream is that one day it will be as politically incorrect and unimaginable to point out which percent of a group is \"special,\" as it is to point out which percent is gay, of any particular race, or any other marginalizing distinction. \n \nTomorrow is the national Spread-the-Word-to-End-the-Word Day. Let's grab hands, sing \"Kumbaya,\" and pledge to end  all \u00a0words that are disparaging, hurtful, hateful, and create division. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.somi.org/images/Events/Spread%20the%20Word/STW2014Logo_With_Date.jpg", "http://lifeasleels.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Alternate-Logo-White.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2014/03/spread-word-to-end-words.html", "title": "\nSpread the Word to End the WORDS\n"},

I've been giving a lot of thought and time during prayer, on what I want to do during this upcoming Lenten season. At Mass on Sunday I was seated next to a friend, someone I've known a long time, but not as well as I'd like. The homily was based on\u00a0 the readings of the Gospel , my favorite verse being Matthew 6:34: \"So do not worry about tomorrow: tomorrow will take care of itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.\" When we were getting ready to leave the church I turned to my friend and asked, \"So, what are you thinking about giving up for Lent?\"\u00a0 She answered, \"Well, after that, I'm thinking I should give up worry!\" \"That's exactly what I was thinking,\" I said. We made a pact right then and there to do it together, to turn it all over for 40 days, agreeing that if we missed it, we could pick it right back up after Easter. \"Don't borrow trouble\" is a favorite expression of mine and one I'm quick to offer others, when so clearly that is exactly what they're doing. It's almost as though we believe we are jinxing ourselves without expression of every possible way things could go sideways. And while I believe in the futility of \"borrowing trouble,\" I'm prone to do it myself, mostly out of habit. They say it takes 21 days to break a habit. I've got 40+. I not only have enough time to break a habit, I've got time to spare. Breaking from the habit of worry is really a practice of mindfulness, being in the moment, and only in the moment, actively and attentively. When worry begins to creep in, I am going to chant the mantra, \"All shall be well.\" I cannot imagine that I'll be excited to wake up Easter morning and commence with a full day of worrying, to make up for lost time.

Lisa is a professor at the University of Iowa, and an incredible writer as well as a learned scholar in the areas of gender, women's and sexuality studies. She shared her story with our writing group: the devastating loss of her stillborn son, and subsequent healing from the experience. \n \n \n \n It is my bias that what makes many memoirs hard to read, is the lack of healing, the lack of transformation, the lack of insight and growth. Lisa's book,  Ghostbelly , does not suffer from that, her process is complete and all on the page.  Ghostbelly \u00a0is Lisa's story of her home birth that ends tragically. How Lisa and her partner, Glenn, actively grieve their profound loss, is what made this book gripping. Lisa and Glenn make arrangements with the mortician, to bring their son, Thor, home for overnight stays, before he is buried. This may sound morbid and hard to read. I will admit that this book pushed me out of my comfort zone in many regards, but that is also one of the many things I loved most about it. \n \nLisa is refreshingly open about her non-traditional, \"unorthodox\" life. I, having a very traditional life and playing very traditional roles, appreciated being more intimately connected to someone so different from me, yet with all the most important things in common. \n \nThere is something going on in my community of friends and fellow parishioners - we're in a dying season. It feels as though not a week goes by that death does not touch someone I know. Lisa's memoir was helpful in that regard - helpful to to be reminded just how personal grief is, how deep, how differently it can be felt and experienced, processed and transformed. I have more compassion having read the book, for the vastness of grief. \n \nTo be able to write such a beautiful and personal account of something so horrific, is a trick not many writers can pull off.

{"date": "Friday, February 21, 2014", "body": "\nWil was on a frozen yogurt kick that went on for years. I don't even want to add up all the money we spent on his habit. At one point we were going daily, and nine times out of ten he'd bring along a friend, and I'd pay for the friend, too. And let us not forget, Wil would get two bowls, and I was forced to get one, too. So. A costly, but ultimately \"productive\" era that put some much needed weight on Wil, and introduced us to many new people and tightened the bonds between the friends we already had. \n \nIt should be made known that during this period we got to know the owner of our favorite yogurt spot, and when my book came out, he agreed to sell it at the store, giving me all the proceeds. The employees kept a Carrie Link envelope behind the counter, and they accepted cash and checks, so often I came in to pay for yogurt, and was given a stack of money. Not a bad gig. \n \nBut, as with all his phases, they end as suddenly as they begin, and offer no warning or explanation. They are just over. Now, instead of frozen yogurt, and instead of daily, he occasionally wants to go to the dive drive-in, home of the famous\u00a0 Kelly and the \"Hope you feel better\" milkshake. \u00a0They have a huge board on the wall offering their flavors of milkshakes, and you can mix-and-match to your heart's content. Rootbeer/creamsicle/Oreo is a favorite. Large. I can now get him to also order a small, plain and dry burger, too, and if we do this anytime after 4:00 PM, it totally counts as dinner. \n \nLike with the yogurt, Wil prefers we take a friend when we go. I guess he's bored to death of me. That, or he just really likes his friends. Let's go with that. Because there is often an inordinate amount of texting on his end, verging on coercion, I always offer to treat the guest. \"Get whatever you want - anything at all - it's on me,\" I say. What I've noticed, is the guests fall into one of two categories: 1) They try to order as inexpensively/little as possible, or 2) They go whole hog. \n \nThe \"cheap\" friends order one little tiny cheeseburger and keep it at that. The whole-hoggers get the \"basket\" deals, and substitute the drink for a shake, then upgrade the shake from a small to at least a medium. When I say, \"Get whatever you want,\" they  actually \u00a0order what they  want. \n \nThere is no question I'm from the former group, whenever I'm being taken out by someone, I scan the menu for the cheapest thing on there, and order that. I wouldn't dream of \"taking advantage\" and getting what I actually  want , let alone \"upgrading\" it in any way. The other morning in meditation I had the dawning realization that I have globalized that mentality. The Universe \"says\" to me/you/us every moment of every day, \"What do you want?\" and I, historically, order off the dollar menu. \n \nI have committed to believing and internalizing that the Universe is at the least, as \"generous\" as I am, and certainly has more in store for me than a burger basket with a shake upgrade. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-dollar-menu.html", "title": "\nThe Dollar Menu\n"},

Let's start with the fact that I was blessed by the weather gods and avoided storms on both ends, and had a glorious vacation in Philly with my friend, Terry. We did nothing, nothing and more nothing. Woke up the next day and repeated it. After sitting in our jammies and robes until noon, walking, coming back and having lunch, showering about 2:00, it was nearly time for Beer O'Clock. \"You don't really need to mountain bike or ski, or something like that to have fun, do you?\" STM asked. I marvel that after 28 years of being together, he still marvels at that essential fact about me. \n \nTerry, aka  The Truth Teller , helped me uncover a few things that are irksome to me. She didn't help me uncover the fact that they were irksome - I was well aware of that - \u00a0she helped me uncover  why , and what I could do to make them less so. Likewise, she helped me see the role my choices played in the irksome-ness. In the end, it all comes down to choices and attitude, doesn't it? Why is that so hard to \"get?\" \n \nWhen I got home I got to pick up my NEW CAR! I think that one should get a new/different car every 17 years, whether they need to or not. I had grown very attached to my car, Virginia. She took Woohoo to preschool and she took Woohoo to college. Now Woohoo is buying her from me. I had that feeling you get when you're pregnant with your second child, and you wonder how in the world you'll ever love another child as much as you do your first, but then two seconds after the baby is born you figure it out: Love expands. You grow a new heart. There is no scarcity to your capacity to love. \n \nSilly to compare a car to a child, but Virginia had come to feel like an important member of the family. She was a constant through years of change and uncertainty. She is an outward expression of everything I hold dear: efficient, faithful, dependable, reliable, low-maintenance, modest, steady as a rock. \n \n \n \nLet me just say this about my not-yet-named new card - cars have come a long way in 17 years!

Brilliant! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSo, yes, I walked out with my same car, only newer, and told the gal, \"I'll see you in 17 years!\" Why mess with success? \n \nFinally, Wil is doing the Polar Plunge on Saturday - a Special Olympics event.

The last time we met she was visiting Portland, and now she's moved here. We aren't close friends really, and on the surface, have next to nothing in common, yet when we talk we never run out of things to say, and have a shared love of books, writing, and several friends. \n \n\"You're radiant,\" she said, almost right off the bat. \"What do you attribute that to?\" she asked. \n \n\"I'm happy,\" I said. \"2013 was a good year for us.\" \n \nAnd it was. \n \nBut it's more than that.

Nobody comes through a dark period on their own, we all need a Charlotte or two (or in my case, many more than that), ones that help us spin our story in a different direction from the one its going in. We all need someone to champion us, to believe in us, to sacrifice for us, to endure us when we're at our most unbearable. \n \nAnd then we need those that bear witness to our progress and affirm it in us, so that we can go out and be a Charlotte for someone else. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://images.cafepress.com/image/22669672_400x400.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2014/01/radiant.html", "title": "\nRadiant\n"},

For me, it's better to one-day-at-a-time it, waking up each morning with a sense of newness and promise, hopes and objectives. I think it's dangerous to lump 365 days together, call them a year, and deem the whole sum as either \"good\" or \"bad.\" Things come in waves, cycles, and it usually takes more than the turning of a page on the calendar, to abruptly interrupt that. \n \nThere is something to be said, however, for resolving, for taking inventory, for starting over, for having hope, faith, optimism and a can-do attitude.

I can't wish Claire a happy new year, I can't tell her everything will get easier and better and back to \"normal.\" Her life has been altered forever. What I can tell her is she's not alone. She has a community ready and willing to step up, to not replace, but to substitute for her mother's role in her life. I can tell her that there are any number of people she can grab onto and hold on, until the wave of I-can't-do-this passes. I can tell her that although the year ahead may not be happy, it is not resigned to being terrible, either. It will be hard. It will be different. It will be sad. It will also have moments of piercing grace, love that shines through and sustains her. I can tell her that each morning of this new year, she will have to resolve to make the day anew, lean into the changes, make open her heart to receive all the love we have to give, so that one day she wakes up and the resolve to have resolve doesn't have to be so strong. \n \nFor Claire, the \"page turned\" on the day her mother left her in the physical world, and became a guide from the other side, one that will shepherd her through these dark and difficult days, with a little help from her friends. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-d6tths2OUKw/UsQoh6DofUI/AAAAAAAABYo/JKvzHh-_OOc/s1600/sc002a2de4.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2014/01/a-new-year.html", "title": "\nA New Year\n"},

The minute he heard, he flew into action. \"I am going to ask Santa for a lump of coal in STM's stocking, he's been naughty, and he's getting a lump of coal. I am going to  ruin \u00a0his Christmas!\" he said with joy. \n \n \n \nI assumed Santa had it all under control, but let's just say there was a little last-minute drama when said coal did not arrive with a moment to spare. \n \n \n \nTraditionally, we go over to my mother-in-law's and open gifts on Christmas Eve. As we were walking out the door he announced that Santa would be putting coal in STM's stocking over there, too, even though we'd explained on numerous occasions that those stockings were filled by Grandma, and Santa didn't start his world-wide trek until Christmas Eve night. He accepted the answer, but was disappointed that STM's Christmas Eve would not also be \"ruined.\" \n \n \n \nAs you may recall, Santa was also asked for an elephant for his friends, Barky and Elmo. There was much anticipation as to what this elephant would look like, and whether or not Elmo and Barky would be excited. \n \n \n \nBecause this is not our first rodeo, we also told Wil he would be getting a bike for Christmas. We have learned the hard way that he does not like surprises. A bright shiny, red bike showed up one Christmas morning, and he was underwhelmed, to say the least. He liked the (teeny tiny) bike he had just fine, and was not having any of it when it came to moving up to a bigger bike. Even if it came in his favorite color. \n \n \n \nThis time we got smart. We told him at his birthday time (and prime bike-riding weather), that he'd be getting a new bike for Christmas. His bike was too small for him, and he needed a new one. STM and I made multiple trips to STM's favorite bike shop, and consulted extensively about which bike would best meet Wil's needs. We got it down to two. We took Wil at a specified time to the bike store, explaining it would only take 10 minutes, but he had to ride both bikes and tell us which one he liked best. He chose in his customary \"random\" way (I think he liked the color, even though we could have ordered the other one in other colors). So, although he did know about the bike, he was excited for the bike, and told everyone, \"I'm getting a new bike for Christmas!\" \n \n \n \nBe that as it may, the three big hits of Christmas were the lumps of coal that \"ruined\" STM's Christmas, Ellie the elephant for Barky and Elmo, and the true huge hit of the year, the $2.00 bottle of foaming hand soap with Santa on it. \n \n \n \nMay we all delight in the little things. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bj5k5IgicRg/UrxAKv46ADI/AAAAAAAABYA/8wCYky6WoLk/s1600/DSCN0351.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c7SHnSpD904/UrxAQnx4WCI/AAAAAAAABYI/UXT7InqKkoY/s1600/DSCN0355.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jSWNoZRs850/UrxAWdKdqYI/AAAAAAAABYQ/iDzf43A1FJY/s1600/DSCN0352.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m9z3XXKC7x0/UrxAbWciJHI/AAAAAAAABYY/Kx6tjLQqc20/s1600/DSCN0350.JPG"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/12/a-ruined-christmas.html", "title": "\nA \"Ruined\" Christmas\n"},

My only issue with that theory is that it implies the shooter was fated to shoot, and I just can't believe anyone makes a soul agreement before coming here, that they will become mass murderers.

On the outside it looks like all I want to do is freshen, purge, repair, replace, and recycle. And even I was lured into thinking that what it  looks  like, is what it  is . \n \nBut we'd both be wrong. \n \nThere's something about turning 50. There's something about facing forward in the next decade to come (Lord willing). There's something about  getting ready for what's next , that is happening. It's like when you're eight months pregnant and you start nesting like crazy: cleaning, sorting, washing everything, folding neatly, and getting yourself as prepared as one can be, before the big event. \n \nWhether or not there's an actual \"big event\" coming or not, is anybody's guess, but what we do know, is that like all the ages and stages that have come before, something is dying so that something may be reborn. To \"die\" there must be a clearing away, a letting go, a leaving behind and a putting away, so that there may be a picking up and moving forward in a clearer, cleaner, and less \"cluttered\" manner. \n \nI do some of my best meditating when I'm in this mode, some of the most helpful insights and connections come to me when I'm moving my body, my stuff, and the energy of the stuff. I'm trying to Eckhart Tolle my way through, that is to say, touch with gentle awareness, the accumulations, the stories behind what is there and why it's there, the inherited baggage, the stuff I have because nobody else wanted it, but nor did they want it to disappear entirely. When I look around and see all the stuff my mother has given me because she no longer had the space or desire for it, but yet, wanted it to stay in the family, I am both honored and burdened. As I go through each photo, each packet of clippings, each box of memories, I see a younger version of myself that has dutifully lugged it all from house to house to house, without ever really  wanting \u00a0it, but never having the skills to make it go away. \n \nI don't want to pass all that on to the next generation, it's not Woohoo's place or problem.

I moved that sucker from list to list to list never once picking up the phone.

STM and I met with the attorney on Friday, and let me just say this about that: I had the best sleep that night that I've had in  years.\u00a0 \n \nI know the issue of guardianship can be controversial - declaring your child incompetent is not something we take likely. Who wants to declare that? Who  doesn't \u00a0want their child to achieve independence, to be able to make good adult choices on their own? We all want that, but not all our children are really headed that way, anytime soon anyway. \n \nTo us, the question came down to this: Does Wil want and need us to keep doing what we're doing, after he's 18? Yes. \n \nThe attorney was trying to get a general sense of Wil by our description, so he could guide us and answer our questions. I should have just showed him this picture, as it's a common sight in our house. Wil often gives me his \"son,\" Elmo, to watch while he's at school - tells me when Elmo needs to take a nap, what he needs to learn from me as he's homeschooled, and when he might want a snack. Sometimes he's worried I will forget the ever-important snack, so he provides one for Elmo, himself. \n \nOn Sunday the family gathered to honor the one-year mark since STM's father's passing. We met at the cemetery, said a few words, then gathered back at STM's family home to eat Snickers ice cream bars, and toast a man we all loved and miss. As brief as it really was, we were all exhausted when it was over - grief is an ass-kicker. In the car, STM asked, \"What's everyone going to be doing when we get home? I will be watching football.\" \n \n\"N-A-P-P-I-N-G!\" I answered. \n \nWil piped up from the back seat, \"K-I-S-S-I-N-G \u00a0E-L-M-O!\" \n \nWhile he may be \"incompetent\" when it comes to making his own health care or financial decisions, while he needs help brushing his teeth and putting on a belt, while he cannot prepare even the simplest meals for himself or use both a knife and fork, he is quite competent in his endless ability to demonstrate and teach how to love. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i9GS4ILLUyU/Um6EmMRVblI/AAAAAAAABWM/i-LYwn5amoE/s1600/photo.JPG"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/10/priorities.html", "title": "\nPriorities\n"},
{"date": "Friday, November 1, 2013", "body": "\nPortland, a city not known for its great weather, has had a breathtaking fall. Let's go back, spring was great, too, and so was summer. Three seasons of beauty, with every reason to believe our winter will be spectacular, too. The forecast was for rain on Halloween, and I was hoping the forecast was wrong, and we could hold onto our streak for one more day, just so all the kids could enjoy a dry night of trick-or-treating. The forecast was indeed wrong-ish, it sprinkled a little in the morning, and the evening was dry and warm! \n \nWil, having eschewed trick-or-treating for 17 years, announced in early September that he was going to be a monkey. We ordered his costume and it sat in his closet, until it finally occurred to me we should take it out and try it on, just to make sure it was going to fit. The thing was one size fits \"most\" and nobody every accused that boy of being \"most.\" \n \n\"It'll be fine,\" he said, and so it came to be that he put the outfit on in a mad dash before school on Thursday, for the very first time. Usually, our mornings are anything but mad dashes, we have way too much time because he wakes up so early, and takes very little time to actually get ready, but he needs a built-in period of lying around with the iPad, listening to iHeart Radio, before he's ready to really launch the day. It's his coffee. I went for a very early walk Thursday, and when I got back, he was still asleep, plus he had an early morning Peer Mentors meeting, hence, the mad dash. \n \nThe monkey costume came with monkey hand gloves and a big head, with the the face totally open, so I thought there was a slim chance he'd wear it, at least for a picture. No dice. And the tail. I did not factor in what having a very long tail would do to him. Let's just say that that tail became a belt more quickly than you can say, no-way-in-Hell. The \"belt\" cinched his pants way too high, and he was left with high waters. Basically, the only possible way of knowing he was a monkey, was if he told you he was. He mostly looked like a tall kid that had grown out of his brown pants, and happened to have a brown top on, too. \n \nHappy as a clam that \"monkey\" was, to plan his first real trick-or-treating outing. In early October he'd already arranged with his friend, Tim, to go out for the evening, a plan that was going to work for both of them, because neither wanted to go long or far, and both wanted to get to bed at pretty much their usual time. But then it mushroomed. Each day Wil came home from school with a more elevated plan for the evening. I did some of my best letting go and letting God, you ever did see. I didn't call mothers. I didn't check with the boys themselves. Nary an e-mail or text was sent. \n \nI did have the foresight to buy extra beer (for me) and two take-and-back pizzas for the crowd. All were consumed. It turned out that five boys from the program he's in at school, sat around our barely-used dining room table, and had themselves a dinner party. STM, Tim's mom, Kim, and I sat in another room, sipped on our adult beverages, and marveled at the day we thought would never come. \n \n\"Has enough been made that Wil's having a dinner party?\" I must have said ten times. \n \nThe doorbell started ringing, and the boys hopped up and answered it, giving us more time to celebrate their awesomeness. When it was finally dark enough for them to go, they put on their makeshift costumes, stood briefly for a picture, and were out the door. Kim and I went to the front porch with our glasses and huge cauldron of candy, and STM stayed inside to clean up the mess. He'd pop out to refill our glasses and the candy and see how it was all going, then go back inside. \n \nBecause by this time I was so \"relaxed\" from all the celebrating, I opted to just put the cauldron down in front of us, rather than holding it and selecting the candy for each kid, and putting it in their bags from them. Kim and I had fun seeing the reactions when we'd say, \"Help yourself!\" \n \nThere were the diggers, the ones that wanted to crouch down and search for just the right piece. There were the easy-to-pleasers, the ones that just grabbed the first piece their fingers came upon. By and large, most took one piece, said thank you, and were on their way. \n \nBut not all. \n \nOne girl looked right at us, dead in the eye, after we told her to help herself, and she said, as though to dare us to argue with her, \"I'll take two!\" \n \nSome would ask, \"How many can I take?\" To which we'd reply, \"How many would you like?\" Most would answer, \"Two.\" \"Have at it,\" we'd say, and their faces would light up with the magnitude of their haul. \n \nOne little girl, about seven, with dazzling light-blue eyes and blond hair, answered, \"FIVE!\" when we asked her how many she'd like. Her side kick lit up, and the two of them got down in there and foraged until they'd found just the perfect five. \n \nThey came back 20 minutes later and marched themselves right to the front of the line, and without even going through all the formalities, began their hunt all over again. \n \nKim is a second grade teacher, and we had a ball talking about the kind of adults these different personality types, would grow up to be. We don't need a long-term, costly research study to tell us this, the ones that know from an early age, that you've gotta ask for what you want, unapologetically, with charisma and strength, are going to be just fine. I, myself, would have taken the one on top, only one, never forgetting to say, \"Trick-or-treat,\" and always remembering to say, \"Thank you!\" It's only at age 50 that I can finally stand with my hands on my hips, look someone right in the eye, smile and say, \"I'll take TWO!\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/11/help-yourself.html", "title": "\nHelp Yourself\n"},

However, I found that I didn't jump right on actually reading it. It sat in the pile taunting me. The last thing I want to do after finally climbing into bed, is read about autism. So, I did the opposite. I got up early for a few days (not many, it's a quick read), had my coffee, and read the book as a meditation. \n \nI highly recommend this beautiful book to anyone and everyone. It's written in a Q&A format, and Naoki answers many of the questions associated with autism, at least as they apply to him. Wil doesn't have classic autism, but there was enough of what Naoki said that clicked for me, and I realized he put to words what I have felt in my soul. \n \nOne such example is, \"Why do you memorize train timetables and calendars?\" His answer was because it's fun! He loves the simplicity, clearness and unchanging nature of numbers. They are fixed. They are predictable. Much of an autistic's life is spent managing anxiety, much of their behavior we consider \"weird\" is their efforts to do just that. \n \nHe was asked about free time, and his response was that for many autistics, free time is un-free time. What they spend their time doing is not so much what they  want \u00a0to be doing, as what they  can  do. \n \nWhen visiting a Japanese town he came across a giant Buddha, and was moved to tears. \"... it was the sheer weight of history and generations of people's hopes, prayers and thoughts that broke over me, and I couldn't stop myself crying. It was if Buddha himself was saying to me, 'All human beings have their hardships to bear, so never swerve away from the path you're on.'\" He wants people to know that not all crying is sadness and meltdowns, or being upset, that people with autism can be moved. \n \nBut my favorite thing he says is the answer to this question: What are your thoughts on autism itself? \n \n\"I think that people with autism are born outside the regime of civilization. Sure, this is just my own made-up theory, but I think that, as a result of all the killings in the world and the selfish planet-wreaking that humanity has committed, a deep sense of crisis exists. \n \nAutism has somehow arisen out of this. Although people with autism look like other people physically, we are in fact very different in many ways. We are more like travelers from the distant, distant past. And if, by our being here, we could help the people of the world remember what truly matters for the Earth, that would give us a quiet pleasure.\" \n \nAmen. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mxilouri.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/the-reason-i-jump.jpg", "http://www.parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Naoki-Higashida-ftr.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-reason-i-jump.html", "title": "\nThe Reason I Jump\n"},

In the shower I had to adjust the mixer knob thingy almost to cold, to keep myself from being burned to death. I asked STM to please adjust the temperature on the hot water tank, and he assured me he'd get right on it that evening. \n \nFriday morning the \"hot\" wouldn't get past luke warm, so I  very gently \u00a0\"suggested\" STM re-adjust the hot water tank again, more to my liking. He confessed he'd forgotten to ever adjust it in the first place, and what was actually happening, was our ancient tank had gone tits up. \n \nNot to worry, he had a guy come out and drain the old tank, and a new one was put into place. That was the easy part. What was hard about the whole thing was hauling all the crap away from the old tank, and making room for a new one to get dragged into a room with barely a breath of space between boxes of junk. \n \nIt was mortifying, actually, to have another living soul in our basement, a testament to our ways. \"It's almost like hoarding down there,\" STM said. \n \n\"Care will get it,\" I answered. \n \nTo be perfectly clear, Care has \"gotten\" it any number of times in the past. The place fills up, Care clears it out, and somehow it mysteriously fills up again. For some reason, we're storing a bunch of stuff for someone I've only met once - a friend of Woohoo's. That's the easiest to identify and ship off to its rightful owner. Much of the other stuff is pretty cut and dry, too. Useless junk is useless junk. It's the sentimental stuff I can't part with, and by \"sentimental\" I mean teaching units I worked hard at creating, never mind that they haven't been used in over 14 years and are antiquated. I have a million pictures of every kid I ever taught. I rifled through a big stack of them today, and it was amazing how both their first and last names came back to me, even after 25 years. \n \nI found old journals, brutal to read, yet I can't seem to toss them. I don't have  all  the kids' old toys and clothes, but I have their/my favorites. I have  nearly \u00a0all their books, and many from my own childhood, too. Heavy tote after heavy tote of books we never look at. What am I saving them for? Grandchildren? Am I going to open my own damn preschool? \n \nI found three jigsaw puzzles that have never even been opened, and several that have only been put together once. Games, games and more games. VHS and DVDs. Will there ever be a point in time that we'll want to watch another Olsen Twins video on VHS? And if so, what's the matter with us? \n \nWant to see printed drafts of a book I never published, and never will, so help me God? Got 'em! \n \nHow about components to old TVs and stereos we no longer own? Check! \n \nTwo million decorations for every holiday known to man? A few party hats and matching plates/napkins from birthdays gone by? Got all that, too! \n \nThe goal is to divide the hoarding mess in half, and be able to quickly find everything, should we ever \"need\" it. I'm guessing I have at least three carloads of stuff already, that needs to go to Goodwill, and I'm far from done. \n \nI know that what I'll feel is relief, when the stuff is gone. I know I won't miss it. I know that when I go down there and can actually walk, I'll feel great - lighter, more able to breath, free of the past and all the stickiness that goes with it. Let me say it again - reading the old journals is so brutal, why would I put myself through ever having them around to read again, by me, and God forbid, someone else? I guess it's the hours and hours and hours that went into writing them that feels \"wasted.\" \n \nWoohoo is home for Fall Break and I made her go down there for two hours with me today. She made a nice dent in her own corner of the basement. All her old teeth that I so carefully kept for her? Gone in an instant. She was a little too quick to part with old photos, I'll have to save those for the next go-round in a few years. She was great about shedding a lot, though, and admitted, it's much easier to part with stuff you've acquired recently, than anything you've held onto for a long time. \n \nAnd there it is, isn't? The longer we've held onto something, anything, an emotion, a grudge, a memory, a burden, a thing, a person, the harder it is to let go of. \n \n \n* I pulled these pictures off of an old poster board from when Wil was in 1st grade and Star-of-the-Week\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-t7P5OWoS_Ig/UlymIfUUyyI/AAAAAAAABVY/O4MI7irKkC8/s1600/sc0028738a.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S3H4w4EG6Io/UlymJPDXPiI/AAAAAAAABVg/JGoYHaWWPzY/s1600/sc0029b9fc.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uxRFHC-nNNs/UlymIWdLkmI/AAAAAAAABVU/aoECScYenzo/s1600/sc0029a7ed.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ILw_LCO0nCw/UlymIQLMxGI/AAAAAAAABVQ/rm9EeWBCX_Y/s1600/sc00295823.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/10/hoarding.html", "title": "\nHoarding\n"},

That being said, it feels like that is all I really do anymore.

I think this was the home stretch, mile 25. See how happy we were to be almost done? \n \nThe race was great, really great. The weather could not have been more perfect, and that's saying a lot. Just the week before it rained in sheets for days on end. Sunday it was dry, sunny, but not hot, and there was a little breeze. \n \nThat's Kathleen in the white, and her daughter, Michaela, in the orange. We were very happy she chose orange when we got there and were in our corals, trying to keep sight of each other. Also, during the first mile or two when everyone was bunched up and zig zagging all over the place. \n \nThe pink hats Kathleen and I wore say Love.

Do you want to come and spend the night with me at college this year?\" \n \n\"I will on October 4th,\" he answered, each time the question was asked, never once looking at a calendar. As we all know, October 4th landed on a Friday this year, and as luck would have it, Wil's high school football team had an away game (far away), so he was free. \n \nWoohoo and Wil worked out the whole entire thing on their own, all I did was pack him a bag and leave it by the front door. Woohoo and two friends, Marcie and Noah, came and got his stuff, before they had a \"wild\" time at Trader Joe's, Safeway, Bi-Mart, and even the Franz Bakery Outlet (the apple doesn't fall far from the tree). Then the three wild ones drove out to Wil's school and picked him up when he was out. \n \nWoohoo lives in a \"coed\" dorm, but really, it's a girls' dorm with a boys' dorm attached. They even have different names. Noah was one of Wil's student assistants his freshman year, and they've stayed in touch. Whenever we go visit Woohoo, we try also to see Noah.\u00a0Woohoo explained it all to Wil that he would not be able to actually sleep in her room, but that Noah and his roommate had room and wanted him, and she'd be \"right next door.\" He bought it. And when I told him he could skip showering, but not brushing his teeth, he was downright giddy. \n \nWil being Wil, rejected all spirit wear options from Woohoo's university I presented to him on Friday morning, and instead, wore a college T-shirt from a rival college. That's about right. I should have forbade him from wearing anything remotely in the color scheme of her college, and he would have been all decked out. \n \nWoohoo, Wil, Noah, Marcie and a few others, had a great time. They went to dinner, they hung out in the different rooms, and at 8:30, Wil went to bed. Noah had an event he had to go to, but the sainted roommate put headphones on and stayed in the room with Wil, playing video games. Woohoo told Wil he could wake up whenever he wanted, but he couldn't be noisy until 8:00. He woke up at his usual 6:00 AM, and STM and I began getting texts. He quietly listened to music on his iPad until the roommates woke up, fortunately, they both had to be up early anyway. Woohoo took over, but the dining hall didn't open until 10:00, so thinking ahead, she had gotten extra \"taco\" from the commons the night before, and heated that up for him in the kitchen in the basement of her dorm, where he could be as noisy as he wanted to be. \n \nWhen the commons did open, the gang all gathered there for the last hurrah, then she packed him all up neatly and efficiently, and brought him back home! \n \nSTM was banging around in the kitchen with a spring in his step, \"I'm excited for the kids to come by,\" he said. I felt like I'd been picked up out of the present (and my fears of the future) and dropped into some alternate universe where we were happy empty nesters, excited for the kids to stop by. \n \nI'm choosing to believe his words were more prophetic than just a case of him not really saying what he meant to say. Either way, the \"kids came by\" and it was fun. Then one of the kids left to go to her other home. Now, the next time someone asks Wil if he's visited any college, he can say, \"Yes.

If I had to pick one, I'd say I was, too, but certainly not \"specialized.\" We've known with Wil from the beginning, that his mind thought musically. During the 18 long months he did little more than cry, he'd show a bit of interest in some jingles that came on TV, and even pause the crying for a blessed moment or two. \n \nFast forward to the age of the iPad and the birth of iHeart Radio. Wil could spend all day on that thing, and has become a music aficionado. He loves all types of music, truly, all types, and has encyclopedic knowledge of bands, their songs, their genre, and which station in which state is most likely to play their music. He loves everything from the Steve Miller Band to Katy Perry. He's good at math, too, no mathematical genius, but his mind thinks mathematically. He can add and subtract effortlessly. I, being visual, am still seeing the problem, borrowing, carrying, and all that nonsense, long after he's come up with the answer. He doesn't  solve \u00a0the problem, he  knows \u00a0the answer. He has math  sense \u00a0that will elude me to my dying day. \n \nWil plays the piano and sings all the time. He's never had a lesson (but he will, don't you worry, he will). His right hand never misses a note. His left is a bit loud and thumpy, but still, pretty amazing. When he wants to learn a new song, I put Scotch tape on the keys and then write with a Sharpie, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. He follows the numbers to get the tune the first time or two, and then he's set. That song is permanently locked in his data base, and at his ready any time, day or night. \n \nWe were at the yogurt shop on Thursday with his former Resource Room teacher, her husband and new baby (the one for whom he's the godfather). We were all chatting away, and all of a sudden Wil broke through the conversation with the question of what was the name of the song on the radio. We all recognized it, but didn't know the name, let alone the band. He persevered and I brought out my trusty iPhone with the Shazam app and in a few seconds was able to tell him it was \"Young Folks,\" by Peter, Bjorn and John. \n \nThis morning, four days later, he asks during breakfast, \"Remember the Halloween video I watched when I was eight? They played 'Young Folks' on that video.\" \n \nNo. I do not remember the Halloween video. I do not remember him ever paying more than five minutes of attention to any video whatsoever at age eight. I do not remember the song from a video I do not remember. \n \nBut I do remember that he is always right about these things. It gives me some insight into the way he thinks, that a song from long ago could so lodge itself in his brain that he was able to access it nine years later when he had another piece to go with it. \n \nI don't need to tell you that autism is on the rise, as high as 1 in 50 boys will be diagnosed with it.

I watched\u00a0 Dan's TED Talk , and like Terry says in this interview, I, too, realized I held a common bias - that non-profits should have low overhead. If you share that bias, I would encourage you to watch his compelling arguments to the contrary. \n \nA couple points in the interview particularly struck me, the first one being the misunderstanding that people that are gay and come out, do it once and are done with it. \"Sometimes I come out four times in one week,\" Dan says. He gave the example of how he and his partner are raising triplets, and a cab driver recently asked him how his wife felt about having triplets. He could have side stepped it, he could have lied, but he came out to the cab driver because not only was that more authentic, it held more integrity for his family. \n \nAs a special-needs mom, I feel like my \"coming out\" days are increasing. I am not saying it's the same thing, don't get me wrong, but what I  am \u00a0saying, is it struck a chord with me when Dan said that. More and more I'm getting casual comments and questions about what my 17-year-old will be doing after high school, and more and more I'm torn between being honest, kind, full of integrity, and also self- preservation. There is just so much energy one has for this type of thing. \n \nDan is an accomplished man, and at one point in the interview Terry steals a famous STM line, \"You're not watching enough TV, as 'they' say!\" she tells him. I love that she has morphed STM into \"they\" and I love that she used it. STM and I use that expression a lot (I think I've even blogged about it), because there was a day (and by \"day,\" I mean decades) where we, too, were not watching enough TV. We were doing/going/moving and shaking all the live long day. \n \nNo more. \n \nThese days we are watching  plenty \u00a0of TV, which brings me to another interesting point Dan made. \"Look at your calendar and see what is on it that makes you excited - what are you looking forward to, and do more of that. Follow your passion.\" \n \nThese days, what gives me endless delight is looking at a calendar, and finding at least one day in the week that doesn't have much on it at all, and if it does, it's something like, \"change the beds.\" Put me in my house with great music and candles, and point me towards the laundry room, and I'm a happy, contented, if not blissful, woman. Give me a day like yesterday, where I was running around from sun up to sun down, scarfing Cliff Bars in the car and calling them breakfast, lunch and dinner, and I'm, shall we say, not a happy camper. \n \nFollowing your bliss isn't always blissful.

{"date": "Tuesday, September 17, 2013", "body": "\n \n \nOk, just got back home after the reading, and my head is aswirl, but I'll take a stab at telling you about it. I won't share much about my friend's reading, other than to say it went all the way back to Christ and the crucifixion. Fascinating stuff. She said my friend, Susan, and I are \"twin souls,\" souls created at the same time, and alternating teacher/leaner roles throughout many, many lifetimes. \n \nMy reading placed me in a past life where I danced along side,  Lillie Langtry ,\u00a0one of King Edward's mistresses. I'd never heard of Lilly Langtry until today. She lived from 1953 - 1929, which means she was still alive when my dad was a young boy, and I can bet my bottom dollar, he knew all about her. \n \nOne thing that\u00a0 Marie \u00a0said, we tend to reincarnate with the same cluster of souls over and over, which, I believe I've written about before. Often our parents, our spouse/partner and kids, are in our soul cluster. We take on different roles and genders, being parents to our parents, and kids to our kids, etc. \n \nIf you were to walk the planet believing you've been every color, gender, sexual orientation, religion, intellectual and class level before, wouldn't you walk the planet differently? But, I digress. \n \nI guess not only was I a dancer in the past life that came through today, but in many, many past lives. Funny, because as a kid all I wanted to do was sing and dance on Broadway. I lacked absolutely everything necessary to do such a thing, so abandoned that dream long ago, but something stirred when she said that. Maybe I'll take a dance class. In the meantime, maybe I'll just dance with a broom in my kitchen to the tunes on Pandora. She also said I could \"dance\" psychologically and figuratively, not just literally. \n \nShe said I didn't come into this lifetime to learn anything in particular, but to have another human experience. That was different from being \"on holiday,\" which some souls are, meaning they are taking a \"bye\" this lifetime from the suffering they've endured for many lifetimes, and are just coasting along this time, before resuming\u00a0 samsara. \u00a0Later, when I told her I thought I'd come into this incarnation to provide a way for Wil to \"volunteer\" as a soul to help lead us out of this mess, she agreed, and then she went on to say many lovely things about my mothering that I'm too humble to repeat. She also warned me about letting people suck me dry, and how it was essential I recharge by being 100% alone. She was singing to the choir on those points, I've learned both the hard way. \n \nWe talked about the deja vu experience, and she said it's actually our subconscious knowing what's going to happen before it happens, so when it happens, it feels like it has happened before. \n \nI did a\u00a0 past life regression \u00a0before, and was, apparently, the most difficult to \"put under\" that this man had ever experienced. That used a hypnosis method by which I was asked to pull up past life memories. I'm not saying it wasn't real or even useful, but it was a big challenge for me. This experience was different, Marie held my hands on top of her outstretched ones, across the table. We each closed our eyes, and for 10-15 minutes she \"had one foot on the other side\" and shared what she saw. \n \nShe said the same thing I've heard over and over again, we all have the ability to use our left brains to see/hear/know things, it's a matter of being open, practicing, trusting, and developing that skill just like any other. \n \nBlessings on all your lifetimes. \n \nNamaste.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.lillielangtry.com/Intro.htm", "http://www.mariefriend.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_life_regression"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-reading.html", "title": "\nThe Reading\n"},

I don't know that  for a fact \u00a0but it certainly feels that way. \n \nAnd, we're about to find out. \n \nSusan has an incredible house and yard. She is generous with sharing both, and is often the host of lovely, if not magical, gatherings. She hosted my book launch, and that will live in my memory forever as one of the most love-filled nights of my life. \n \nOne hot morning last week, Susan had me over for espresso in French demitasse cups, with sugar cubes that had each of our initials on them. We drank water poured from a beautiful carafe into elegant stemware. We sat under a grape arbor at the perfect little table, with a beautiful, antique table cloth, ironed within an inch of its life. One reason I believe Susan and I have karma, is I am all about the, \"Nothing fancy,\" and she is all about the, \"Let's get FANCY! Life is for LIVING!\" Her joie de vivre is contagious. \n \nWe had one of those glorious two-hour conversations that felt like two minutes. One of our most favorite things to talk about is spirituality. I shared my thoughts on reincarnation, and Susan was very open, but at the same time, a bit skeptical. We talked about a couple people that have come into our lives in such big and powerful ways, some briefly, some for the long haul, but the relationship's intensity defies the confines of this lifetime. To me, it only makes sense that it's past life stuff being picked up from where it left off, old lessons that haven't quite gotten to the finish line and are presented to us for another shot at it. \n \nSusan texted today and said, \"I know I'm breaking the no-call rule, but I just have to talk to you.\" I called. So glad I did. Susan was unable to shake our reincarnation conversation, and did some Googling. One thing led to another, just like it always does in a universe where there are no accidents, and she found a woman here in the area (sort of), that does past life readings. \n \nHer name is\u00a0 Marie Friend . FRIEND of MARY! Come on. You have to go read that blog post of hers I just linked to, it's all about children (like Wil) that do NOT come back to continue on with the unfinished lessons from past lives, they come to  help heal . \n \nSusan called Marie right up on the phone and found she had openings coming up, she mentioned her friend (me) would probably want to come too, and Marie was all about making that happen. Long story short, they couldn't settle on a day that worked and then Marie said, \"Well, I know it's short notice, but I could do tomorrow.\" As fate would have it, we were both able to slightly juggle (way less juggling than normal), and we are GOING TOMORROW! \n \nRight after I got off the phone with Susan, I was thinking about some of the people that have come and gone from my life, and I put on Pandora. The song that was playing was one that always makes me think of such a person. \n \nYou go ahead and tell me that was an accident.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mariefriend.com/blog/?p=376"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/09/karmic.html", "title": "\nKarmic\n"},

I think we should also put on the To Do list, some things that are fun. We aren't having enough fun in our lives.\" \n \nSTM is self-employed, and has been for fifteen years. At times this has really come in handy in terms of \u00a0flexibility, and at times it's been a giant pain-in-the-who-ha (i.e. the five years he worked in the basement when I had two not-in-school-yet kids). \n \nBecause I am highly driven by a To Do list and derive endless frustration from watching it grow, I agreed. Sad, but the \"fun\" part was really just a bone I threw him. \n \nFor three Fridays now, we've taken the \"day\" (really, it ends up being the hours between 10-2), and tried to mix a little business with pleasure. For pleasure, we've test driven a car, had lunch, and done a little shoe shopping. \n \nAs I've said, we are trying to pick out new carpet. I think we're both gun shy because the carpet we chose last time, has been such a disaster, we don't trust our choice. I've now made two trips to the carpet store with knowledgeable friend/interior designer, two by myself, and two with STM. We are all over the map. I keep coming back to something similar to what we already have, and STM wants anything but. \n \nPart of me is so deeply invested in what we choose, it's ridiculous, and part of me is so ready to have the decision made and behind us, I'm ready to just say, \"Have at it. Get whatever you want.\" \n \nIt's carpet. \n \nThat tension between what I want, in the small sense, and what I WANT in a global sense, is ever-present. \n \nBefore taking off to go carpet shopping with STM yesterday, I popped in on my support group that meets one Friday morning a month during the school year. We hadn't seen each other since June, and I was anxious to hear the updates. I gave mine very quickly before I had to leave, and talked about the tension between wanting to really enjoy these two years I do have, with Wil in school full time, and not piss them away with anxiety about them coming to an end. By the same token, I can't sit back on my laurels, there are things, big things, to attend to. \n \nOne reason I probably spend way too much time obsessing about the carpet, is that it's way easier to focus on that, than the decisions I really need to make, that really make a difference. \n \nI'm doing a 21-day mediation and today's mantra was, Om Gum Ganapatayei Namaha, which is intended to remove all obstacles. I got up early today and relished in the fact that Wil had spent the night with my mom, so there was no bacon to fry, no Flicka to let out, no tapping, humming, singing, hyper start to my morning. I put my headphones on and settled deep into the meditation. \n \nOm Gum Ganapatayei Namaha. \n \nOm Gum Ganapatayei Namaha. \n \nOm Gum Ganapatayei Namaha. \n \nI was well on my way to repeating the mantra 108 times, when my phone rang. It was Wil. It was also 6:32 AM. He wanted to button down every detail of the day, and in fact, the weekend. Which mass did we want to go to? What time did we want to go to Burgerville? Could we take Mike to Mike's Drive-In and get a milkshake? Mike's name is Mike so we should take him to Mike's. What about his Halloween costume? When will it arrive? We ordered it online, so when will it be here? \n \nI got all his questions answered, took another sip of my now not-so-hot coffee, and put the headphones back on. \n \nOm Gum Ganapatayei Namaha. \n \nOm Gum Ganapatayei Namaha. \n \nOm Gum Ganapatayei Namaha. \n \nWil texted. He made plans to go to the park at 9:00. He'd see me at 10:00. \n \nOm Gum Ganapatayei Namaha. \n \nWil texted again, maybe he'd be home closer to 11:00. \n \nOm Gum Ganapatayei Namaha. \n \nWil texted again. What time was I coming over to get Flicka for a walk? \n \nI took off the headphones and gave up on meditating.

Somehow I always forget there will be bumps and overwhelm, exhaustion and readjustment, annoyances and redundancies, surprises good, and surprises bad. We here at the Link house, do not care so much for all that. \n \nWil will not wear a watch (anymore), and cannot have his cell phone on at school (totally understandable) and does not read conventional clocks easily. He carries on his person a pretty good-sized travel alarm clock, and that is his method for keeping himself on time. I triple checked that said alarm clock was in his backpack when we headed to the car. I did not see or hear him remove said alarm clock, from the backpack, and displace it in my car. I noticed only after I was back at home and stuck there, waiting to receive a package that requires a signature, that never came, and now is likely to screw up tomorrow, too, but that's another post. \n \nBecause said alarm clock was not in place, meds were not taken on time. Because meds were not taken on time, pretty much all hell broke loose. All that coupled with the surprises bad, redundancies, overwhelm, blah, blah and blah, let's just say that Beer O'Clock came early today. \n \nWoohoo, too, is having her share of \"issues,\" none of which are serious, but nevertheless taxing, tiring, frustrating and kind of a buzz kill. I will say this, Woohoo is at a great college, and to hear her talk about her classes and be  excited \u00a0about what she's learning, is a wonderful thing. STM and I went to perfectly fine colleges, but I think for at least the first two years, we simply took classes because we had to, and we just checked them off. We weren't engaged (one of mine was \"taught\" on television), we certainly weren't inspired, and we definitely weren't excited. \n \nOn a completely different note, I had plans to have coffee with my cousin Nancy today. In the middle of the night Saturday I sat bolt upright in bed, and realized I could not meet her for coffee, because I had to be home waiting for the package-that-never-came. Long story short, she came to me, and I invited my mom (her aunt) to join us. The three of us had a lovely time. \n \nTrue confession: I hesitated having Nancy come to my house, because our carpet in the living room is so old/dirty/stained/trashed, and we are in the process of picking new carpet. Because we're so actively in this process, the existing carpet's flaws are in flashing neon to me. Nancy actually said these words to me during her visit, \"Did you get new carpet?\" My mom, too, seemed surprised when I mentioned to her why the samples were all up against the wall. She thought our carpet was just great. \n \nThe truth is, our carpet is not just great. Our carpet was cheap to begin with and we've put it through hell. \n \nThe truth is, our carpet is just great. To the casual observer it does what it needs to do, it covers the floor, it's warm under the feet, and with enough carefully placed furniture, it's \"fine.\" \n \nThe truth is, so much of what is wrong, right, in need of fixing or just fine, is a matter of perspective. One (me) gets too close to the situation and looses all perspective. Sometimes the smartest thing to do is crack a beer and call it a day - a day like all days, with its highs and with its lows.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/09/transitions.html", "title": "\nTransitions\n"},

It's an exciting life I live. \n \nWhen I got to the hospital where the mammogram was to take place, I had to check in with all the people getting much scarier imaging and actually, quite a few people checking in for outpatient services of all sorts. The scene was a sea of cubbies with people of all ages and sizes in various stages of the check-in process. I wasn't nervous, I've done this a million times, but as I made my way through the maze, I saw an elderly man wearing a jump suit. Now, this caught my eye because STM had an uncle known for wearing jump suits, and we have made quite a big deal out of it. STM and Wil threaten me all the time with getting matching jump suits, and have even gone so far as to go shopping for them once (coming back empty handed - jump suits are harder to find than you might think). \n \nThe man in the jump suit grabbed hold of his elderly wife's hand and they ambled slowly out of the cubby maze, and towards me. I couldn't take my eyes off of them, they were adorable, they nearly glowed with love for one another. As the man got near me he said, looking at me with rheumy eyes, \"We wish you well.\" \n \nI thanked him, but couldn't get him out of my mind afterwards. I was so struck not only by the jumpsuit and his kindness, but by the \"we.\" His wife never even knew I was there - I don't think she even saw me, fully absorbed by getting checked in and then making her way out safely with the help of her husband. \n \nWil got a card from his grandmother for his birthday. She is not a big God person, but she knows Wil is, and so she carefully selected a card designed for a grandma to give her grandson, talking about what a blessing from God he is.

Last week she had an intern sitting in with her, a young woman that looked all of 20 but had to be older than that, merely by the fact that she's an intern. \n \nAfter glancing down at Wil's chart and noticing he'd just had his 17th birthday, in all honesty and earnestness the doctor looked at me and asked, \"Have you given any thought to what will happen when Wil turns 18?\" \n \nI looked at her and the intern and said, \"I think of very little else.\" \n \nThey giggled. \n \nI was not joking. \n \nI think of  very little \u00a0else. \n \nI was making Wil's dinner last night, really shaking it up and heating up frozen French fries from a bag, and he said, \"I've thought long and simple about what I want to be for Halloween this year. A monkey.\" \n \nGrabbing a Post-It I wrote down his exact words so I wouldn't forget. I loved that he didn't say long and hard, he said long and  simple .\" Over and over again, many times a day, I am reminded (painfully) that I make things much harder than they need to be. \n \nHere's to a life that is both long and simple.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/08/long-and-simple.html", "title": "\nLong and Simple\n"},

{"date": "Monday, August 12, 2013", "body": "\n \n\u00a0We have just returned from a week of family vacation. Notice, I did not put the word \"vacation\" in quotes, as I have done for the last seventeen long, LONG years. I am not going to lie and tell you it was nothing but fun in the sun and relaxing from morning to night, followed by peaceful, restful sleep. No. But I will tell you that nobody killed each other, nobody had a meltdown, and there were a lot of laughs. We successfully went out for \u00a0\"dinner\" (4:00 PM) twice. We had a lot of togetherness and periods of finding our four corners of the small rental house, and doing our own individual versions of stimming. \n \n \n \nWe rented the same house in Sunriver that we rented last year. Our trip last summer was successful enough that we thought we'd have another go of it. Plus, there was this: The Landing: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPardon my creepy shadow in the picture, and just drink in the glory of \"the landing,\" which in fact is a two-part landing, as you can see. Wil has talked incessantly for a year about the landing, and how he cannot wait to get back to Sunriver where he can hang out with Flicka and Elmo, and enjoy the landing. From the landing one can see whatever someone (STM) is watching on TV. From the landing one can still have his finger on the pulse of whatever is happening upstairs, as well as in the kitchen. Really, it's pretty much all about the landing. \n \n \n \nAs I was racing around the house like a mad woman the morning we were to leave, Wil was extra janked because of his anticipation over the landing. I had less patience, more to do, and he was doubly loud and extra annoying. I was an inch away from throttling him, when he said in the sweetest, most sincere voice imaginable, \"Care, I know this is a lot of work for you, but you're successing.\" \n \n \n \nCheck in wasn't until 4:00 and we weren't even guaranteed our house would be ready before 6:00, none-the-less, Wil had us all on a tight 8:00 AM departure schedule for the four-hour drive to Sunriver. Because I've played this game before, I did think to call ahead and request an early check-in. They said it was their busiest season, and that was unlikely, but request I did. I am happy to say that after getting over to Central Oregon and killing time, they called and said we could have our house at 2:30. Some people win lotteries, I win early check-ins. \n \n \n \nWe got to the house, and the landing, and Wil quickly moved on to his next item on the agenda: The Pool. \n \n \n \nLast year I could only get him in the baby pool (one-and-a-half-feet deep). We'd get there the minute the pool opened, and would leave after a couple babies came. I would have to sit right by the side and talk to him the whole time, dying a thousand deaths. I have spent the better part of this last year telling him that seventeen-year-olds can't go in baby pools, and that he would  have \u00a0to go in the \"big\" pool. I then assured him for a solid year, that the \"big\" pool was only four feet deep at its deepest, and he was now six-feet tall, so there, do the math, two feet of him, at least, would be above the surface at all times, if necessary. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOur first morning at Sunriver he and I rode our bikes over to the pool, and were there when they opened at 10:00 AM. He didn't hesitate. He got in that pool just like he'd done it a million times. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe then spent the next two hours walking around singing to himself. Only three other boys were in the water, and they were in the \"deep\" end and mostly not even in the water, but chatting in lounge chairs. \u00a0Wil would talk to me periodically, and then report what the next ten songs were going to be that he was going to \"sing.\" He'd get to about song four and then ask for the next one. There was no way on God's green earth that I could remember ten things successfully, let alone ten songs I cared nothing about.. Finally, a super nice man from the couple that had been watching and listening the whole time piped in, \"'Rumor Has It,' by Adele. That's the next song.\" He wasn't the least bit perturbed. He was into it. We struck up a conversation and then spent the next hour happily talking about music and kids and lives and such. \n \n \n \nFor the next four mornings all of us got to the pool when it opened, and as the week went on the pool got busier and busier and busier. Wil still happily walked around in the water humming and singing for up to two hours in a row without getting out. \n \n \n \nOn our fourth day at the pool we moved our lounge chairs into the grass, so we could tie Flicka up right outside the fence, where she could see us and we could come give her lots of pets. That dog does not appreciate being left home alone, especially when we're in a strange house. There was a couple also in that area, already at 10:00 AM, and since we were the only ones over there, we struck up a conversation. Well, you know how when you find out you're from the same town/college/etc. you start asking, \"Do you know the?\" It was unbelievable. Literally, every single question one of us asked, the answer was, \"Yes!\" We probably knew 20 people in common, at least, we had neighborhoods in common, schools, friends of friends, on and on the list went, I was even a sorority sister of the gal's sister. \n \n \n \nSTM and Wil had been playing with the Nerf football in the pool, and Wil ripped the end off of it in a moment of lack of impulse control. When we got back from the pool, we squeezed all the water out of it, put it in the sun to dry. Later STM asked me to play a game of catch with him. If STM were married to his dream woman, they'd play catch hours a day and she'd be really good. I am not that woman. For 27 years he's been trying to teach me to throw and to catch, even attempting to teach me how to give it a spin. I was working my tail off trying to figure out how to spin the ball properly, what with the hacked off end and all, and honest-to-God, I could not figure out how to do it so the pointy end went first. \n \n \n \n\"Just turn it around,\" STM said. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI was so focused on getting my hands around the \"laces\" that I seriously, could not compute how to get the \"right\" end facing him, too. \n \nWe had a good laugh about it, but then STM said, \"That's how Wil feels all day, every day.\" \n \nWil, I know everything is a lot of work for you, but you're successing.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-A2obr2VCoVk/UgbcpOqrisI/AAAAAAAABS4/YV5h1l34p4A/s1600/photo.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DPKi8Mv80LY/UgbZmWHT20I/AAAAAAAABSc/v_qVvxc4RWQ/s1600/photo.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nQeHpTSPaNw/UgbZqWT0qLI/AAAAAAAABSg/ldBv5ivtou0/s1600/photo.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uq4VC_XhgI0/UgbZvg4260I/AAAAAAAABSo/2hKyiN2rj70/s1600/photo.JPG"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/08/successing.html", "title": "\nSuccessing\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, July 25, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nI had my about-once-a-year astrology reading on Wednesday. I've been going to this astrologer since 2006, which doesn't sound like a super long time, but nonetheless I feel like we've been through a lot together. It's quite an intimate relationship. I, at least, feel like \"it's\" all right there in front of her, no pretenses, no fancy footwork, no posing or re-framing. What she sees is what is there, written in the stars - things you know about yourself and things you don't, things you want to know about yourself, and things you don't, things you're trying to figure out about yourself and things you've got all figured out. \n \nIf you've never invested in a reading with a good astrologer, I encourage you to consider it. For me, it's intensified and accelerated therapy. Whatever it is you're pondering/struggling with/considering/moving towards or away from, after a reading you feel less cluttered, more affirmed, centered, pointed in the right direction. How can you put a price on that? \n \nShe reviewed with me my lifetime lunation cycle: \n \n \n \n \nAs we all know, we cycle through a darkness and light cycle each day, each month, and throughout our lifetime. It's not all in our head - there are periods where we are planting, and periods where we are harvesting, periods of ripeness and periods of being fallow. The trick is to move  with \u00a0the cycles, and not  against \u00a0them. I am two-and-a-half years away from my next summer solstice, and that's exactly what it feels like to me - there is something around the corner that is not quite ready to come up, but is just below the surface. We talked at great length about what that/those might be and what to do in preparation. We think it might have something to do with my preoccupation with the rampant intellectualism that is still mostly okay in our culture. \n \nThe other thing I wanted to look at was Wil's chart, and what is coming up for him. A year from turning 18, two years from being done with school, lots of ideas but no big plan, I was needing some astral direction. The astrologer has done Wil's chart before, and when she pulled it out this time she said, \"Oh, there it is again - the\u00a0 Cardinal Cross \u00a0 -\u00a0the symbol for the oneness of all life. Is he very spiritual?\" \n \n\"Very,\" I said. \n \n\"It's too bad he doesn't live in India - India would know what to do with a person like this. This is the chart of high spiritual teachers.\" \n \n\"Does he have an altar in his room? Could he be an altar server? You know what, never mind, he  is \u00a0the altar,\" she said. \n \nI left an hour later with renewed mission in the holy work Wil has to do in this world, and my role in facilitating that. \n \nAmen. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mqjsaxh-kr8/UfFd3Zhg6mI/AAAAAAAABRc/d_q0JgbHP7s/s1600/photo.JPG", "http://www.miamiastrology.com/wp-content/uploads//astrology-moon-cycles.jpg", "http://www.xstarian.com/Cosmic_Cardinal_Cross.html"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/07/be-altar.html", "title": "\nBe the Altar\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 23, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \nToday was one of those days where I felt like I was in my car all day - haven't even read a single page of GONE GIRL. Every turn I tried to make was thwarted by traffic, detours, construction, bridge building, or faulty directions by Siri. So rattled, at one point I very nearly turned right onto a one-way street going the opposite way, and I would have, too, had it not been for the urgent and persistent honking of the car directly behind me, warning me of my almost-disaster. I did wave a thank you to her upon correction and redirection, then quickly turned at the next possible corner to avoid any sort of awkward eye contact from mirrors. \n \n \n \nI tried to run into Safeway just to get a few things, and everything was moved, as in, every thing. Scratch that, the bread was where it supposed to be, likewise the produce, but everything else had moved since the last time I was there. Just like all the roads I'd so gratefully gotten off of to come into the store, there was nothing but one way streets and road blocks, detours, poor directions and inherent frustration. \n \nA few hours and multi-errands later, I crossed the Sellwood bridge to take Wil to the doctor. The Sellwood bridge is not fun on a good day, and these days there ain't nothing but bad days, as the ancient bridge is being replaced right next to the existing/temporary one. I almost always go over the bridge and turn right/north but this time I went under the clover-leaf and drove south. I'd forgotten because of the massive construction project, the zone is now 25 MPH, down from 45 MPH. I got too close to the car in front of me and then realized she was not just trying to drive me crazy, she was indeed, following the speed limit. I slowed way down, put a respectful amount of distance between us, and thought we were done with the matter, but she rolled down her window and flashed her hands dramatically, first holding up two fingers, then five, then back to two, then back to five. \n \nGot it. \n \nTried to find a nearby frozen yogurt shop after Wil finished at the doctor and Siri fervently insisted I turn left on a street where no left turn was allowed. Had to drive forever to get myself going in the right direction. Ate my yogurt grumpily outside on the beautiful day, as someone inconsiderately sat and smoked nearby. \n \nLoaded back into the car and packed it full of my black mood, heading on the freeway near rush hour. We limped along, finally got off on our exit, hit more construction and traffic, before heading back over the Sellwood bridge. This time I was in the lane with the right-of-way, and the traffic coming from the other direction, trying also to get on the bridge, had a yield sign. Every time I cross that bridge from either direction I marvel that the city of Portland has created its own \"rule\" that you take turns at that point. Invariably, the car without the yield, lets one car with the yield go, then he/she goes, and on and on it continues, taking turns beautifully, systematically, without \"having\" to, \u00a0without signage, without monitoring, just because it's the right thing to do - take turns. \n \nAnd just like that, my good mood got its turn.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EWL5qTufygE/TQKDzO27iaI/AAAAAAAAADo/4tm2zz6NEwg/s200/Sellwood+Bridge.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/07/taking-turns.html", "title": "\nTaking Turns\n"},

I'd always wondered about your life, but I didn't want to pry.\" \n \nI don't know if this phenomenon is unique to my family or if it's more of a greater cultural thing, but I was definitely raised with the theory, \"If they want me to know, they'll tell me.\" \n \nI do not subscribe to that theory. \n \nAt the same reunion my cousin's 19-year-old daughter, having just finished her freshman year of college and considering a career as an OT, also read my book, and asked if she could ask me a few questions. \"How can therapists be most helpful, and what is okay and not okay to ask parents?\" \n \nAren't those good questions? I answered that it had way more to do with intent, than with word choice. The \"wrong\" question with the right intent, is still the right question. You can easily tell the difference between idle curiosity, and genuine interest, and all is forgiven when someone is on the same team. As far as what therapists can do to be most helpful, again, conveying their intent to be most helpful, is most helpful. Opening that door to being someone the parent and/or child can go to for support, ideas, strategies, problem-solving, guidance, a kick-in-the-%$#, whatever the case may be, that is most helpful. \n \nRecently I saw an old friend. She and I are part of a foursome that gets together several times a year, and has for 24 years. We have been through a lot together, shared births, deaths, divorces, re-marriages, \u00a0new jobs, retirements, and all of life's ups and downs. Or at least I thought so. I just learned that some pretty big things have been omitted over the years, I am sure it's to protect the privacy of others, I am sure it's because those things are hard to talk about and are a buzz kill when you're getting together for drinks and some laughs.

He came into my life exactly nine months prior to that, as his presence was known to me instantly, and of course, he was born not  around \u00a0his due date, but  on  \u00a0it. He has kept himself and everyone around him to a rigid schedule ever since. \n \nThis past year he has come into his own. \n \nHe is a long, long way from being able to  live  independently, but he is ever closer to being able to  think \u00a0independently. He knows his own mind; what he likes, what he doesn't like, what he wants, what he doesn't want, what behaviors he will accept from others and what behaviors he will not, what he will spend his free time doing and what he will not. \n \nA couple of mornings ago I was flying around the kitchen trying to get his breakfast in front of him, cleaning up the kitchen, wiping up all the water Flicka dribbled from her bowl to her bed in some mad tail-chasing order that repeats itself each and every morning with frustrating regularity as I tried to get out the door to meet Kathleen for a 7:00 AM walk. Wil prattles, the microwave beeps, Flicka dribbles the just-wiped area, the toaster pops, I inhale one bite of my own breakfast, repeat. And the prattling isn't something you can just nod and tune out, he gets you on the hook, he's arranging things, putting his requests in, planning his life. \n \n\"We will go to Trader Joe's at 8:02 and I will get gluten-free Jojo's for dad. We will get blueberries and strawberries and watermelon and pineapple because we really need to have flavor-changing in action for our water. The water in our fridge is really old and we really need to have flavor-changing in action. We will have blueberry water on Wednesday, pineapple on Thursday, watermelon on Friday and on Saturday we will have strawberry. The water in the fridge is really old and we really need flavor-changing in action just like the frozen yogurt that gets flavor changed, we will need to do that every day so we will go to Trader Joe's at 8:02 and get all the flavor-changing things.\" \n \nI buzz around the kitchen even more maniacally with each order he barks, check my watch to make sure I'm not late, grab the poop bags, a Kleenex, my shoes, the leash and set it all out by the door. \n \n\"Care,\" he says, \"I am only sixteen for a few more days. It's really important that you remember that. Don't forget that I am only sixteen for a few more days. Time is going by. I am getting older. Just remember that I am only sixteen for a few more days.\" \n \nWhen each day feels like the last in so many ways, times 365/year times seventeen years, it's hard to step back and see the growth, see the changes, see the distance you've travelled and see the future as one whose flavor will continue to be in action. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-J5gvfBPEVrk/UeFgmioLrOI/AAAAAAAABQ4/dVxw9kUAd84/s1600/photo.JPG"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/07/seventeen.html", "title": "\nSeventeen\n"},

Don't you worry your pretty little head, I have the mattress pad, sheets, pillows and new duvet cover already purchased and waiting anxiously to be put onto the bed we have yet to purchase. And yes, I have pulled the duvet cover out of the package and held it up against Calm Tint several times just to make sure it's all matchy matchy. I've hauled his area rug off to get cleaned, I've dusted cobwebs and scrubbed corners and baseboards. \n \nWe moved all his furniture into the center of the room, and I thought for sure that would drive him crazy and he wouldn't be able to sleep, so I stripped all the bedding on the spare bed he sits on to watch TV in the little funky non-room next to his. I did the blanket, the sheets, the comforter, even the decorative pillows. As I pulled the down comforter out of the dryer and feathers flew everywhere, it dawned on me that there were  feathers \u00a0flying everywhere. \n \nMy boy is allergic to feathers. \n \nHis bedroom doesn't have feathers because, like I said, my boy is allergic to feathers. \n \nYears ago I switched his comforter and pillows to down alternatives.

Not ever. For years and years I read to him at bed time and although he did enjoy a few (he loved the\u00a0 Robert Munsch \u00a0books), after oh, say, fourteen years or so of that torture, I finally just stopped. He never asked about it - never said to me, \"How come you don't read to me anymore?\" Likewise, I never again suggested when he was bored, that he go read a book. \n \nYet, oddly enough, when I asked Wil if I could move the bookshelf out of his room when we painted and re-did his room, he said no. \"You're not touching my bookshelf. Keep it right where it is. Don't move a thing.\" I gave it a couple of days and then I suggested I move it downstairs so we could paint, and if he wanted it back in his room after we painted, I'd put it back and load up all the books again. To that, he agreed. I put the books in totes and hauled them to the basement. I loaded up three grocery bags full of ones I never wanted to see again, and took them to Goodwill. I kept all the ones that had been mine, I'd used in teaching, or fondly remember reading to Woohoo - and that was a ton. \n \nI could not believe how emotional the experience was of looking through the books -how many memories came flooding back - some from nearly 50 years ago. The next person to hear these stories will probably be my grandchild, and Lord willing, that will be a decade or more from now. \n \nWhen Wil saw the bookshelf all cleaned off, empty, and in another room, he looked at it and said, \"That's old. I don't want that old thing.\" \n \n\"That old thing\" had been my dad's and came into my life almost exactly when Wil did. I am attached to \"that old thing.\" \n \nI saw a friend at church on Saturday night. She is the mother of an 18-year-old with special needs. \"I read your blog about re-doing Wil's room. I understand about the books. Such  promise, \" she said. And that was it exactly. That was the final layer of the emotional load that the books brought on. Not only all the assorted memories, but the  promise \u00a0I once held for a reader. For a boy that would learn to read and then read to learn. That would find solace in books. Company. Escape. New horizons. Adventures. Information. Pleasure. \n \nAnd so I let the bookshelf sit in its temporary spot while we paint and re-decorate, and let some more time go by, some more healing, some more acceptance, some more touching with gentle awareness all that isn't and all that is. \n \nAnd in the end, I predict I will fill the shelves with all of my own books that don't fit on any of our shelves, that lie in boxes and on top of other things, waiting for a true home of their own. I will place candles up on top and invite the light to shine, to warm, and to transcend. \n \nAmen.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kSaJdms9xLs/UdBxpPVE5KI/AAAAAAAABOw/M365NDhjzo8/s640/photo.JPG", "http://robertmunsch.com/"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/06/promise.html", "title": "\nPromise\n"},

{"date": "Friday, June 14, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \nWednesday night one of my favorite people, Susan, and I went to \"experience\"\u00a0 Theresa Caputo \u00a0live, and let me tell you, it was an experience I will not soon forget (and I forget darn near everything). If you love her on TV, you will go crazy seeing her live. She is everything she is on TV and then some. \"Uncut.\" She swears, she laughs at herself, she knows what she knows and doesn't apologize for not knowing what she doesn't know (someone said they owned a hobby farm, and she said, \"Yea, I don't know what that is.\") She is so good with herself it is refreshing. On TV it seems like everything she channels instantly \"clicks\" with the people she's reading, but I'm sure there are all kinds of bits and pieces cut to make it fit into a tidy half hour. Live, she sometimes says something that gets a \"no,\" but she persists. \"I may not be explaining the symbols I'm seeing in a way you understand at first, but your loved one insists...\" and she will work and work until the \"click\" happens. And it always happens. And more than once the \"click\" was for the person next to the person she was reading. She'd say something, and then the person right there would say, \" I  understand about the potatoes,\" (which was how the hobby farm came up). \n \nShe told one man his father had learned many lessons on the other side and had grown. She explained that there are levels on the other side - the lower the level, the more lessons yet to learn. I've always \"thought\" that, too. Thought not being the right word - I actually had a visitation 25-years-ago from a loved one that had committed suicide. He \"explained\" to me in my \"dream\" that there are levels - if you don't finish your work here in the physical world, you go on working on finishing it on the other side, and move up the levels there. \n \nTheresa said we do have a destiny, but also free will. We can control our destiny with our choices, and others can change our destiny, too, but if that happens, then we are fulfill that destiny on the other side. When we make \"bad\"choices, we just have more to do \"later,\" but it gets done. \n \nThere were 3,000 people in attendance (I'd say 2/3 women), and she probably read 30 people. Some she read briefly, some she really lingered with. There was one young man sitting in the very front row that she just quickly said, \"Your loved ones want you to know that some people are just mean. Ignore them. Don't let mean people keep you from doing what you want and need to do - SCREW 'EM! Does that make sense to you?\" Through tears in his eyes, he nodded \"yes.\" \n \nShe asked one woman if she had a medallion of the Blessed Mother hidden - maybe in her bra? The woman about lost it and said, \"It JUST broke! I had it around my neck and it JUST fell off and ended up in my bra! And it was WELDED together!\" \n \nThere were lots of tears and lots of laughter. There were wild shouts when Larry (her colorful husband) showed up down near the stage and waved to all of us. There was hilarity when Theresa stopped a reading to tell a woman seated nearby, \"I LOVE your hair!\" Naturally, the woman's hair bore a striking resemblance to Theresa's. Speaking of Theresa's hair - one woman getting a reading with her boyfriend, \u00a0gave a gift to Theresa at the end. The woman said she was a hairdresser and Theresa pulled from the bag a can of hairspray and immediately gave herself a good dousing, and it was obvious she could do this maneuver in her sleep. \n \nTheresa opened by pointing out her shoes and saying, \"If nothing else tonight, we can talk about my SHOES!\" They were Louboutins with crystals embedded all over them. They were perfect and so her. I couldn't take my eyes off of them. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. I couldn't take my eyes off all the people having a shared experience. And there was no denying that Spirit was alive and present in a very, very big way. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://newsroom.mohegansun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/theresa-caputo-web.jpg", "http://www.theresacaputo.com/"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-experience.html", "title": "\nThe Experience\n"},

During my most recent self-improvement kick, I partook in the\u00a0 Hay House World Summit 2013 . I should put the word \"partook\" in quotation marks, because I really just dabbled - 20-30 minutes a day of one of the ten speakers-of-the-day, before Wil woke up and my day went from zen to business-as-usual. \n \nGay Hendricks was one of the speakers, and he spoke about many things, including the four zones, which he outlines in his book, The Big Leap. They are the zones of competence, incompetence, excellence and genius. Most of us spend a lot of time in the first two zones, doing what we do, over and over again, and spending way too much time and effort doing things we really aren't cut out for. The goal is to spend the majority of your time in the zone of genius - doing what you came here to do, doing what fills you up, what you do better than anyone else, what is uniquely your skill set, what sets you and the world it touches, on fire. \n \nI can't stop thinking about this, because I definitely spend way too much time competently taking care of the day-to-day tasks and chores, and way too much time feeling guilty for  not \u00a0doing things at which I am incompetent, but tell myself I not only should be doing, but should be doing well! Insanity. I occasionally spend time in the zone of excellence, and have touched the bliss of the genius zone. It's bliss for a reason - it's right and good and lines up with our higher purpose. It's not that our ego is being stroked and that's why it feels good, it's that we were born to do that. We are on track. We are in alignment. \n \nEven if we can't take a big leap straight from competence/incompetence to excellence and genius, we can baby step it. We can bring this idea into our awareness. We can notice when we are in alignment and when we aren't. We can touch each of those moments with gentle awareness. We can put out the intention into the Universe. \n \nAnd then we can wait expectantly for the Universe to compassionately and swiftly bring forth more opportunities to practice. \n \nAmen.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thebigleap.net/", "http://www.hayhouseworldsummit.com/"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-big-leap.html", "title": "\nThe Big Leap\n"},

I am blessed to have MANY favorite cousins, but this is the one I go to for matters of the soul. We spoke of the Celtic Sacred Art of Living and Dying, of mindfulness practices, of touching with gentle awareness our own repetitive reactions to the same old %#@*, and how we've both come to embrace the concept that our weaknesses are our strengths overused. \n \nAll day as I tended to the repetitive, never-ending, mindless-yet-good-for-mindfulness activities AKA \u00a0housework (think: company coming), I worked on that notion, until I finally had a lightbulb moment when I realized that's what the expression, \"... to a fault\" means. \"He's nice to a fault.\" \"She's generous to a fault.\" \"He's humble to a fault.\" You get the idea. We are all \"to a fault\" something(s), and the \"fault\" part is what bites us in the you-know-what. \n \nI told my cousin that one of my strengths was efficiency, but conversely, when overused, it was a definite weakness. Efficiency, \"to a fault\" doesn't allow for meandering, it doesn't allow for discovery, it doesn't allow for others with a different speed and approach to collaborate very easily, it doesn't allow for rest, it simply doesn't allow. \n \nAnother of my strengths/weaknesses is thoughtfulness. I think of others \"to a fault.\" \n \nI have plenty of other strengths and plenty of other over-used strengths/weaknesses/faults/shadow sides, whatever you want to call them.

{"date": "Saturday, June 1, 2013", "body": "\nI spent all day Thursday at a special-needs conference entitled, \"Great Expectations.\" It was meant to be a shot-in-the-arm, there was an explanation of codes and services, what we can expect during the 18-21 transitional years, and ultimately, beyond that. The crux of it was that even though the statistics are depressing: 80% of people with disabilities are unemployed, work is  possible \u00a0for  everyone.  We spoke of such things as Person Centered Planning, thinking outside the box, perseverance and tenacity. Hard to believe there was a parent in the room that wasn't all too familiar with perseverance and tenacity, but the target hit the mark, and I think most of us left with a renewed sense of  it's going to be ok , and  I can do this. \n \nWe heard two remarkable stories of young men \"experiencing\" disability. That was the term-of-the-day and while I appreciate what they were going for with that one, I am going to stick with \"having\" a disability, because that does not exclude the fact that all people \"with\" disabilities are much more than their disabilities, and regardless of how impacted they are, they have gifts, strengths, interests and abilities, too. Speaking of which, one of the men, now 32, was not born with a a disability. He nearly drowned at age two, was in a coma for seven weeks and in the hospital for two-and-a-half years. He has a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acquired cerebral palsy. He is non-verbal, and virtually quadriplegic. He has some movement of his arms but it is involuntary. He can move his head and indicates yes by looking at his right knee, and no, by looking at his left. He uses computerized communication devices and is quite adept at letting his wishes be known. At seventeen he told his mom he wanted a summer job, just like his three siblings. Her internal response was,  what could you possibly do? \u00a0She now works tirelessly with other families helping them shift this paradigm and get their family member employed. Her son eventually went to work for\u00a0 Powells.com . He works five days a week, four hours a day, at a competitive wage (which I think is actually minimum wage, but not sub-minimum wage like many people with disabilities). He has held the job for FOURTEEN YEARS. He has an assistant with him that is paid through state funding, but Powells pays this man. With special computer technology, he scans books that are going to be shipped from Powells to online buyers, and gets the scanned information into a computer system, all by turning his head left or right, accordingly. \n \nHe loves his job, but it wasn't enough. He wanted to give back to his community. He started a\u00a0 Free Little Library \u00a0with the help of his father, and two afternoons a week he goes into his local public grade school and early readers read to him to practice their reading. \n \nThe other young man is twenty and has Down Syndrome. His is a twin, and his brother was going to leave home and go to college, and he wanted to, too. With some support, but a lot of his own initiative and again, tenacity, he is now living 100 miles from home, in student housing (a Christian, college-age youth center and co-op). He got the ball rolling with a transitional IEP in his new town, and is receiving transitional services while he works to prepare to enter the local community college. He took the entrance exam and missed qualifying by one point. Not to be discouraged, he is studying so he can take it again.

Win/win! \n \n2) For the 10 years we've lived in this house I've somehow missed this nasty dust trap behind the pedestal sink in our bathroom. You don't even want to know what and how much I pulled from that baby yesterday when I discovered the horror. I kind of want to tell you, so \"impressive\" it was, but I also kind of want you to still like me, so I won't. \n \n3) People always ask me when I do a book talk, \"What is Wil into now?\" We've had the blue twos, we've had the red Volkswagen bugs, we've had the Lifesaver popsicles, on and on the list goes. Well, the answer to what he's into now is iHeart Radio and Volkswagen Vanagons/Westfalias. Like, big time. He has his phone set on the camera setting whenever we're in the car so he's ready to snap a picture of any and all Vanagons, and quickly text random people the captured image. There is one in our neighborhood, and don't kid yourself for a minute - we plan our routes accordingly to make sure we don't miss a golden opportunity like that! \n \n4) I decided at the last minute on Thursday that I needed help with a party I was throwing for one of Wil's teachers that is leaving. Don't you know it, my friend, and one of Wil's godmothers, Nancy, totally answered the bell, dropped what she was doing and became my co-room parent with a moment's notice. I have the best friends in the world. Amen. \n \n5) I'm super excited for \"The Bachelorette\" to start a new season on Monday, because life without bad TV, is no life at all. And that is bad TV at its baddest. \n \n6) This morning I cleaned my desk. I mean to say, CLEANED it. Took everything off, scrubbed the living daylight out of it, threw a bunch of junk away, updated the To Do lists and put it all back together in an organized fashion. Ahhhhh... My idea of bliss. \n \nI think that brings you right up to the minute. If there's any other exciting breaking news to report, don't you worry your pretty little head, I'll make sure you are well informed. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/05/thrilling-pt-2.html", "title": "\nThrilling, Pt. 2\n"},

I put all the information on his iPad when we got it so I could load it with appropriate apps, and until this very recently, it has not been a problem. I gave him the don't-buy-any-apps-without-my-approval lecture, and for well over a year, he didn't. But, apparently the lure of Coin Runners was just too much for him. \n \nI contacted the iTunes Store immediately, and was placed with an angel named Nadine. If you have phone phobia, then Apple will work well for you - there was not even a possibility of speaking live to a \u00a0person from the iTunes Store, and at one point I even said, \"Could you just call me?\" It was at that point where Nadine requested the order number of each and every order for which I wanted to be refunded. Let me tell you, dear readers, there were one hundred. I counted. I still don't get it, but there was no cutting and pasting option, and even if there had been, each \"page\" of orders, 10 orders to a page, 10 pages, had only 8 of the 10 digits on them, I had to click each of them (let me remind you, there were a hundred) to get the last 2 digits. Of. Each. I then laboriously wrote each one down, eventually coming up with a system, because Henry Ford ain't got nothin' on me when it comes to assembly work. As pathetic as this sounds, I was sort of born for this tedious, laborious, repetitive, mindless work. \n \nAfter coming up with my handwritten list of 100 order numbers (all from March to April), I typed them all up and had to attach them in an e-mail. Apparently that impressed the powers that be at Apple because I was informed within 30 minutes that I would not only recover the $1,100 I originally went after, but a grand total of $1,608.38! ($500 in charges hadn't hit the Visa yet.) That is a helluva lotta Coin Runner! I think he would order it, load it, play, delete and repeat. Sometimes multiple times a day.

I was a nervous wreck before the book came out and my friends and family can attest to the fact that I was no fun to be around. FULL of self-doubt, fear, anxiety, apprehension, your basic low-level emotions. Now is the fun part - the part where the people that already love me are reading it and telling me they love me. Only time will tell if the book will ever reach circles beyond my immediate circles. \n \nWhat I'm particularly loving is having people tell me the parts in the book that struck them the most. For many women, it's the summer I spent in Sisters alone. As one woman said, \"There isn't a woman in our age range that didn't, or doesn't, need a summer away.\" She then went to talk about a particular part of the book where I was in Sisters and commenting on the actual mountain range. I remember when and where I wrote that section, it's burned in my memory. The thing is, I didn't actually  write \u00a0it, as much as  type \u00a0it. I remember reading what my fingers had just typed and thinking,  damn, that's good! \n \nLikewise, when I wrote the blog post about my\u00a0 twenty-first anniversary , I got a lot of feedback from my community. One woman even went so far as to say that was the best thing she'd ever read about marriage. Again. Only the typist. I felt the urge to write, sat down and started typing. It was effortless. It was only a matter of opening the computer and letting the words find their way to the page. LOVE when that happens. It doesn't happen often, for every time it does happen, there are dozens of days when I just plod along. \n \nI guess that's how it is with anything: most days you just show up and shove the boulder up the hill, but every once and awhile the stars align and the boulder moves with only the gentlest of touches, sometimes only a whisper, or a wink will get it to go. And those are the days you hang on to with hope, while you continue to wake up each day, plant your feet firmly on the ground, and start to push. \n \n \n \n* Photo from\u00a0www.truceinc.com \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.truceinc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Girls-can-do-anything.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/01/when-boulder-moves-itself.html", "title": "\nWhen the Boulder Moves Itself\n"},

Virginia and her husband of nearly 60 years, Larry, had eight children - six girls and two boy, 21 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren. A more loving family you simply will never meet. It's impossible. No wonder I was drawn to them 36 years ago, and can't stay away. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOur friend, Megan, and I drove down to Springfield yesterday for the funeral, the reception, then the after-party at Larry and Virginia's home of 53 years. We laughed, we cried, we looked at old pictures, we told stories, we ate, and ate and ate, then we drove home in the dark and the cold and the fog and all the rest, warmed from the inside out. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSoon as we got back to the house Ruth offered me a glass of wine, and told me the story of the H3 (hard to see, but that's what the label says on the bottle she's holding). She said they'd all been drinking that wine all week while they planned the funeral, but there was no real significance to it, someone just brought it and they were drinking it. Or so they thought. \n \n \n \nThen Ruth said her youngest sister, Teresa (on the right) had noticed that if you broke apart the \"H\" in H3, it was really 1-13, which was the day Virginia died. Cue woo-woo music. It gets better. Virginia was cremated, and her remains will be in the mausoleum at her church, temporarily. Larry wants her to be there with him when he goes to church each Sunday morning (just like he has done every Sunday morning in that church for nearly 60 years). After he passes, Virginia will be moved, and they'll be laid to rest together. \n \n \n \nIt came to the part in the service where the eight children, their husbands and wives, 21 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren all walked over to the mausoleum, and placed her remains. Her spot in the mausoleum? Do you really even need to ask? H 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHere's a picture of Larry with three of his biological daughters, and just some of his many adopted ones. \n \n \n \n \n \nLarry was telling Ruth and me how much he loved Virginia, and how he told her when she was in a coma, but he wasn't sure she heard him.

When I wrote THE BOOK, I deliberately made Woohoo and STM \"shadow characters,\" people who are essential to the story, but are not really in it, you know? I did this for a number of reasons, their privacy, respect for them having their own version of \"my\" story, and with memoir, you have to decide what  the \u00a0story is, and tell that.

You'll read all about liz when you read my BOOK, which will be available January 17th, which, as you well know, is just 2 short weeks away! \n \nLet me tell you, friends, enjoy the lull before I talk more about the book, the book, and more about the book! Truly, there is very little on my mind besides it, oh, that and the fact that I'm the world's worst mother - more on that in a minute. \n \nIf you want to test your own endurance, write a book. \n \nIf you want to drive yourself crazy over and over and over again, write a book. \n \nIf you want to mine your life, write not just a book, but a memoir. \n \nIf you want be kind, write, then edit, then edit some more, said memoir. \n \nIf you want to know who your true friends are, write a book. \n \nIf you want to know where you were, where you are, and where you (think) you're going, write a memoir. \n \nIf you want to eat, sleep, breath nothing else for years on end, but then only end up with a 233 page document, write a book. \n \nIf you want to go from excitement to dread, from hope to apprehension, in a rapid and repetitive cycle, launch the book. \n \nI could go on, but I think you get it. You get it, right? \n \nNow, about that world's worst mother thing. Here's the deal. As I have gone through the BOOK over and over again, I've been struck, mostly, with what a perfect mother I am for Rojo. NOT the perfect mother, to be sure, but the perfect mother for HIM. Yet, my Achilles heal is the fact that he eats so poorly. \"Poorly\" being an understatement. Toast, bacon, pizza, taco meat, hamburgers, Goldfish, frozen yogurt and junk food. That pretty much says it all. Try as I might, he outplays, outwits, outlasts me. He is the survivor in the game of eating. \n \nTook him to the naturopath today. Haven't taken him there in over 2 years. Got tired of paying $100 a pop, out-of-pocket to be told he needs to eat better. Because it had been so long since we checked in, we went, and I took all his supplements/meds/vitamins with us for her to review. Turns out, he's been taking a prescribed multi-vitamin the pediatrician has prescribed (with fluoride), plus the one  she \u00a0prescribed, thus over-dosing him on certain vitamins. And not for a time or two, but for nearly 3 years. She's worried about damage to the kidneys and liver. She's worried about a variety of things. Plus, she basically gave me the you've-got-to-pick-your-battles-and-this-one-is-one-of-them speeches. Of course I  know \u00a0all that, but if you lived in this house, I dare say, you'd have a helluva time getting Rojo to eat better, too. \n \nAt one point Rojo said, \"Well, I'm a really picker eater.\" \n \nThe naturopath said, \"You're old enough for me to say this to, that's a load of crap.\" \n \nSome of that must have sunk in, because Rojo did say on the ride home, \"I'll eat a vegetable in 2 weeks.\" \n \nI'm going to gear up and really give it the ol' college try to get him to eat better. She suggested (urged) me to withhold frozen yogurt if he doesn't eat his green veggies. I told him I didn't eat enough of those myself, and we'd do it together. So, dear readers, you have two things to look forward to hearing about ad infinitum, the BOOK, and Project Veggie. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-lull-before-launch.html", "title": "\nThe Lull Before the Launch\n"},

Such is fitting for two middle-agers, we were home by 7:00, in bed by 9:00. That is not to say that we didn't have a wonderful time. We hoisted our wine glasses, looked into each other's tired eyes and STM said, \"We've hung in, hung in, and hung in, and we still love each other.\" \n \nIt's fair to say we love each other  more \u00a0than we did when we got married, certainly more than when we  thought \u00a0we were first in love. And it hasn't all been \"hanging in,\" there have been a lot of laughs along the way. Nobody can make me belly laugh like that one. \n \nI can't, and won't even try to write the book on love. Married love, above all, is so complicated. (Parental love is simple.) There is no magic formula, it must work for the two parties involved and that is all - what is good for the goose, may not be good for the gander. There are double standards, silent agreements, spoken arrangements, and times when going to the mat is the only choice left. There are times when saying nothing is a sin, and when it's the greatest kindness you can offer the other. There are situations when retreating is the thing to do, and when being a dog with a bone is the saving factor. There is no road map and no key to the kingdom. It's trial and error, it's gut-it-out, it's savor the good and overlook the bad, it's for better for worse, it's forgive and forget, it's a spiritual covenant, it's a karmic relationship, it's a sacred contract. \n \nI don't think all sacred contracts are meant to last a lifetime - some relationships, marriages, friendships, do what they were supposed to do - take us to where they were supposed to take us, teach us what they were supposed to teach us, then they expire. I do believe that my contract with STM is multi-lifetime, and that we came together in this lifetime, for very specific purposes (not the least of which was to have Woohoo and Rojo), and we have many more ahead. \n \nAt the end of January we will return to where this picture was taken - Kauai, 21-years later. We will celebrate my 50th birthday, and the people we are today, look back at the \"kids\" we were then, and look forward to what we will become.

Then Rojo, my mom and I went over to visit my cousin and two of her kids that are visiting from Chicago, that was fun, and kept the festive feeling alive. \n \nToday the it's-all-over-but-I-am-not-ready-to-put-it-all-away feeling crept in.

If I've learned anything, it's that nothing chases the blues away like a big dose of gratitude. \n \nI gave Rojo personalized notecards for Christmas, and he was game to start using them today. He even embellished them slightly, veering from his standard, \"Thank you, love, Rojo.\" As I sat down with my stack, lighted candle, pretty music and yummy drink, a feeling of deep thankfulness swelled up and washed away the blahs. The gifts themselves are lovely, and I appreciate them, but more than that, I appreciate the givers. I appreciate the thought that went into them. I appreciate, in four cases, that unexpected people gave me unexpected gifts that were right up my alley - and with no expectation of being given a gift in return. \n \nAnd isn't that what a gift is?

As we got closer and closer to the year, I got more and more worked up. Then a funny thing happened, as we turned our 2012 calendars to December and the 21st was just one more day before Christmas, one more day to get stuff done in a hurry, the last day Rojo had school, a day with things to do, people to see and places to go, it lost the feeling of being a day of any significance, and became just another day. \n \nThen I spoke to my friend Val, and we decided it should NOT be just another day, it must be a day \"marked by grounding and gratitude.\" We both feel that 2012 does, indeed, mark the end of an era, and that is a good thing.

Just a little something I like to call priorities. \n \nSo, because I missed the morning, I had to do my homework ahead of time, and do what the other women were going to spend their morning doing. \u00a0I was to make a\u00a0 SoulCollage \u00a0card, answering this question: \n \n \n \"What is Guadalupe asking you to bring into being, now, in this time of transformation?\" \n \nFor those of you unfamiliar with SoulCollage, it's just that - you design a collage, by listening to what your soul is trying to tell you.

That is the same exact mall where Rojo and I were just 24-hours (almost to the minute) before. The people in line to see Santa fled, Santa ducked and covered, two people died, one person was seriously injured, then the man killed himself. \n \nI don't even know what to do with all this. I, who never watch the news, watched for three hours straight yesterday, staring in disbelief at what I knew to be true, listening to the same information over and over and over, hoping it would somehow change. \n \nRojo had big plans for us after school - I was to pick up Nancy on the way to get him, then the three of us would get yogurt at the Clackamas Promenade, then go to Costco because we were totally out of Tree Top fruit snacks, and that was the biggest problem in our lives at the time. Nancy and I got Rojo at 3:30 sharp, and five minutes later his whole school went into lockdown. Can you imagine Rojo in lockdown? \n \nAs we drove the short distance to the mall, we saw police car after police car, sirens blazing, but we couldn't quite tell where they were going, only that they were coming from all directions. By the time we got to yogurt we'd seen at least 20, and more were on their way. As Rojo started in on his second bowl of yogurt, a man ran into the place and said, \"What's going on at the mall?\" The workers there said, \"There's a gunman in Macy's. 60 shots have been fired.\" (That number turned out to be exaggerated, but that was the number that everyone was hearing at the time.) It was surreal. Nancy, Rojo, me, the only customers, two trapped employees and some guy off the street, gathering our information and plan, suddenly thrown together by fate. \n \nWe told Rojo we would have to go to Costco another day - we wanted to get home and off the streets, we wanted to get in front of the news. Rojo protested briefly, but quickly saw that we weren't kidding. I think even he was shaken up a bit, although he argued to the contrary, continuing to blather on about minutiae, as we watched from across the street, the number of ambulances and police cars continue to increase their presence at the mall. \n \nI know of one friend and neighbor who had just been to a movie with her elderly mother. Because her mother needed to use the bathroom before going home, they went out a different exit. Had her mother been ready to leave when the movie was over, they would have walked straight out into the food court where the shots were being fired. \n \nAnother neighbor and classmate of Rojo's was at the food court at the time, she and her friends abandoned all their things and ran out of the building. They are shaken up, but fine. \n \nA friend of Woohoo's works at the mall. She had to hide in the building until the All Clear was called. \n \nTerrifying. \n \nHorrific. \n \nLots of stories coming out about all the good will and cooperation that was shown, too. People helping each other. Store employees getting their customers in safely and then locking the gates. The elderly being helped to find safety, one man carried a pregnant woman while her husband picked up their toddler and ran. \n \nToday is 12/12/12, the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Never have we needed her more. \n \nMary, pray for us sinners, now, and in the hour of our death. \n \nAmen. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://kptv.images.worldnow.com/images/20320068_BG6.jpg", "http://xfinity.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20121212/US.Oregon.Mall.Killings/?cid=hero_media"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2012/12/tragedy.html", "title": "\nTragedy\n"},

Let's just say I was incredibly nervous. I'd studied, read and re-read my list of instructions, and went through the process in my head multiple (like OCD) times. I asked to do the cup because I was way too nervous to try to do the bread, and give non-bread takers a blessing. It may take me months to work up to that one. When it was over, and I polished off the rest of the wine that was in my cup (per instructions), I put it down, bowed before the Tabernacle with the other servers, and sat down with waves of relief. Then, I didn't give it another thought (other than,  phew! ). \n \nMass was almost over, we were singing the song of sending forth, and the woman sitting in front of me turns around and says, \"Aren't you supposed to be up there?\" I'd totally forgotten that I needed to recess with the other servers, the priest, the deacon, and all the other VIPs, such as myself. I was mortified, but able to nearly sprint up there, do a quick bow just as I heard the cantor (Rojo's DD caseworker) say, \"Verse one again.\" I'd taken so long to get up there, they'd run out of music. Everyone was waiting for me. Like, nightmare time, when the whole crowd is watching you screw up and things move in slow motion. Truly, horrifyingly embarrassing. \n \nI haven't quite recovered. But here's the thing. We always sit in the same spot, way in the back on the right. This time, before church, Rojo had informed us we were sitting in a different place, behind two of his faves. If we hadn't sat there, I wouldn't have had the woman sitting in front of me that told me to get up there. No accidents. Still, it's a scene I keep replaying in my head, and no amount of STM telling me nobody noticed, will erase the moment of horror. \n \nOn a brighter note, the visit to Santa was as easy and pain-free as such a thing can be. We bolted to the mall after school, got in line behind about four other families. They were all so engrossed in grooming their (small) children and selecting photo packages, they didn't pay us much attention at all. The \"elf\" did look at us a little strangely, but I shut her down and informed her we were \"just visiting,\" and were not going to be purchasing a photo, let alone a whole set of them. I told Rojo he didn't have to sit on Santa's lap, he could just go up to him and talk. \n \nRojo had spent the whole car ride, walk through the mall and standing in line time, debating on what to ask for. I thought we'd had that settled, he'd told STM he wanted pineapple licorice. Then he changed his mind to Thera-putty, then as we were walking through the mall and I pointed out the store where we were going next for jeans, he said, \"Maybe I'll just ask for jeans.\" \n \nSo, that is how my 16-year-old stood near Santa, pointed to his jeans and told him he'd like a new pair, only longer, as he'd grown since the last time he'd seen him.\u00a0\"That couldn't have gone any better,\" he said when we were done. A few minutes later he said, \"I don't think he recognized me.\" \n \n\"No, he may not have,\" I said, \"but that's because you've changed so much since last year.\" \n \nBut really, he has only changed on the outside, inside he's still the sweet, innocent, thoughtful, grateful, easy-to-please boy, we all know and love.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2012/12/follow-up.html", "title": "\nFollow Up\n"},

Would it be okay if Dad and I went to the one at Home Depot?\" \n \nI knew that STM's Santa-ability was even less than my zero ability, but I decided to make that Rojo's problem. \"No, it would not break my heart. Work it out with Dad.\" \n \nI asked a couple more times if he and Dad had a plan worked out, and Rojo would always say, \"He's thinking about it.\" I knew that the longer it took to get the message to Santa, the more stress I'd be under trying to find whatever weird and random thing he pulled out of his butt to ask for, so I started getting panicky. \n \n\"You know, you don't always have to  ask \u00a0for something, you can just say to Santa, 'Surprise me!'\" \n \nYesterday he was digging all over for \"flavored\" hand sanitizer, another of his obsessions. I had a stroke of brilliance. \"Rojo! Why don't you ask Santa for flavored hand sanitizer for Christmas! He can bring you all kinds! AND, you don't even have to tell him in person, you can e-mail him! He just needs to know what you want, he doesn't have to actually see you.\" \n \n\"Do you just e-mail him at Santa.com?\" he asked. \n \n\"Yes!\" I said, having no idea if that were true. \n \nI scurried to my BFF Google shortly after and found out that yes, you can e-mail ol' St. Nick. \n \nRojo's happy.

I know a woman that has had one impressive, and diverse, profession/calling after another, and she already knows what her next one will be. It, too, is exciting, and I couldn't agree more that she'd be perfect for it. Me? Not so much. When I was a teacher, I was a good one, but no part of me wants to do that again. \u00a0When I'm honest with myself, I've never really aspired to be \"more\" than a wife and a mother. Staying home and taking care of my family and home, has been my dream, and my reality. You don't get much more blessed than when that's the case. \n \nI take comfort in the fact that Mary was not flashy in her time, she did one big thing in a quiet way - she mothered. She took care of a special boy so that he could do what  he \u00a0was called to do. \n \n \n*Photo from stlouisreview.com \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://stlouisreview.com/sites/default/files/article-images/94634_web_2011Nov30_immaculate_conception_3559.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2012/12/answering-call.html", "title": "\nAnswering the Call\n"},

But, alas, she is not only a GOOD proof reader, she is, the best. She found things in the manuscript that the umpteen people before her have failed to find. \"Little\" words totally omitted (to, of, etc.) Words that had an \"s\" but didn't need one, words that didn't have an \"s\" at the end, and did need one. Misplaced quotation marks, commas where periods should be, spacing errors, wrong word choices, a \"who\" that should have been a \"whom,\" and vice-versa. 70% of the dog-eared pages are because there was some weird inconsistency with the quotation marks, as in, the actual mark.

He never felt less than. He always felt grateful that his family was happy and healthy and had what they needed: love. \n \nLast Monday Don lay in bed with Hospice care. Doreen came to sit beside him and tell him the story of their lives together. She started with their first date, 62 years ago to the day, and worked her way through the highlights since.

She is Nancy's \"granddaughter.\" We got to puppy sit part of yesterday (Rojo and I) when Layla's family all went down for the Duck game. See that afghan Flicka is lying on?

I was at the kitchen sink and thought Layla was just lying there chewing on her toy, but she had gotten up and was trying to chew up Flicka's \"bed.\" Flicka came and got me. Either she was pissed, or she was worried that Layla might ingest 100-year-old foam. I'm not sure which, but good ol' Flicka saved the day. \n \nSTM was gone this weekend, so Rojo and I were on our own. We had a lot of fun.

For\u00a0 Rosie \u00a0he picked shampoo (and not just Sauve, he isn't CHEAP like his mom), two bottles of nail polish and gum. For the male friend he picked out mints, and because the card he selected was a money holder one, we argued over how much money to put in there. He wanted $100 because, \"Care, he's a good friend.\" We settled on 1/10 of that. \n \nCame home and quickly wrote out the card for Rosie because we were picking her up in 10 minutes to have her help Rojo pick out a Halloween costume. She helped us last year, so now it's tradition.

We'd stand in the aisles of Safeway, Bi-Mart, Target, Walgreens, you-name-it, and just smell, smell, smell. Having trouble deciding on just  one \u00a0\"flavor\" we'd often end up with two or three.

She sent him a thank you note in the mail a couple days after I dropped it off, so touched was she that he would think of her in such a sweet way, and remember that her favorite fragrance was lavender. He bought one for his other grandmother, too, as well as both his primary teachers. \n \nOn Sunday we dragged Nancy on our hamburgers/frozen yogurt/soap shopping run. \"It's like the shampoo,\" she said, having been dragged on more than one shampoo sniffing expedition, as well. We also picked out treats for his teachers, Hot Tamales for one (because she loves cinnamon) and gum for the other, because he swears she loves gum. \n \nGot home and were getting everything in his backpack to take to school the next day, and the Hot Tamales had gone all Don Wilson on us (for those of you that are unfamiliar with that phenomenon, it's when things simply vanish from our house, usually showing up in an obvious place, way, way later).

Grabbed a new box of Hot Tamales and were heading to the self-check again when he said, \"Let's just go look at the soap really fast.\" While he was sniffing and debating whether or not we also needed raspberry in the mix, I texted Nancy. \"Guess where I am and what I'm doing,\" I wrote, \"smelling soap.\" \n \nI wouldn't have it any other way.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2012/10/keepin-it-clean.html", "title": "\nKeepin' it Clean\n"},

She said, \"Sonam and Kunga are going to the game, too, look for them!\" I didn't want to tell Rojo we might see them because I was afraid it would be too difficult and knowing we would arrive late in the first quarter and leave in the fourth, I didn't want to get his hopes up (and hear about it non-stop for the two-hour drive). \n \nSTM rode his bike from Portland to Turner (past Salem, like a four-hour bike ride), and Rojo and I drove down and got him on the way. Right before we made it to Turner Rojo says, \"I'm going to text Sonam and tell her to call me at 12:30.\" Granted, driving to Eugene would make him think of her, but I had said  nothing . He didn't hear back from her and I wasn't sure just what he wanted to talk to her about when/if she did call. \n \nWe got to Eugene, parked a long ways, hopped on our bikes that STM had all loaded up on the back of the car, and rode to the game.

Come on. WHAT are the chances of that? About 100% when your name is Rojo. We walked a ways with them, visiting, hugging, and telling them we'd hook up in the stadium at some point. Then we hopped back on our bikes and rode the rest of the way. \n \nGot to the stadium and it appeared that people were sitting in our seats, so we went over to the student section and sat down in some empty seats. Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a woman stand up to take a picture with her iPhone. \"Is that Sonam?\" I asked STM. Sure enough, there she was, about two rows down from us. I'm telling you, there were over 50,000 people in that stadium. HOW could we not be able to sit where we were \"supposed to\" only to sit RIGHT by Sonam? Long story short, she was with another family and so three of them were in their season-ticket-holding-seats, and she and a friend were \"students.\" \n \nTurns out no one was sitting in our seats and eventually a marshall pointed that out to us and had us move, as I guess he wasn't buying we were students. \n \nSo, today Rojo had me taking him all over tarnation, meeting his every request. We did yogurt with liz in Lake Oswego. We were at Trader Joe's and Safeway before most people were out of bed. We were at New Seasons. We invited Nancy over for Beer O'Clock which was really water o'clock. Basically, he said, \"Jump!\" and I asked, \"How high?\" all day long. Something new and different. \n \nCleaning up after dinner I spotted the chocolate bars he has me buy so he can give them away - you know the ones, the little three-packs that they sell at Trader Joe's?

We know enough of K. to know he's wonderful, let's just say that. \n \nAnyhoo. Rojo got it in his head that life would not go on without K. as a helper, and so he somehow got K.'s cell number and began texting him multiple times to see what could be arranged. Today when I dropped Rojo off way too early, THERE was K., already there, standing outside ready to walk up to the car, help Rojo unload all his stuff, and escort him to his classroom, whereby I imagine he helped unpack all the stuff and make some sort of sense of things. \n \nI teared up seeing K. there early, ready to help, answering the bell. More than that, I was reminded for the one trillionth time, that Rojo will be okay. It is not all up to me. He can advocate for himself. He can make stuff happen.

Rojo is not ready to go back to school, he's dreading the work, the homework, in particular. He would go on living his summer life forever, if possible: working at the preschool 9-1, riding his bike, swimming, going for frozen yogurt with his wide range of friends, being outside in good weather, finding the ice cream truck every day, etc. It's the good life and he's loving it. \n \nThe teacher at the preschool, Sandy, said this year he is much more of a leader, and less of a peer to the preschoolers. He is already talking about doing it again next summer, and God willing, Sandy won't retire and that will be possible.

She would ride it with him for as many times as necessary, until he could manage it entirely on his own. We're not talking transfers and distant places. We're talking learning how to catch it two blocks from our house, go somewhere nearby (without me), and come home. Rojo was all for it. I made sure to get his buy-in before even calling them. We had it on the calendar, we talked about it several times. He answered the door when she came.

Because if there's one thing STM does well it's pack/load/unload, we had that girl fully in, in 1 1/2 trips from the car, thanks to STM's handy dandy hand truck/cart thingy. Then, today, I went back and met her after she finished the service immersion, and helped her really settle into her room. Actually? I put her clothes on hangers and tried not to tell her where everything really SHOULD go, since it's, let's face it, none of my business. \n \nWent back later this evening to learn all about dorm life from the hall director, and bring her various things she's thought of that she needs, and haul more stuff out that she doesn't.

We go to the arcade, drop $40 in about 4 minutes, go to a salt-water taffy place and hand pick a bag's worth, have lunch at Pig-n-Pancake, hit the beach, build a sand TV, throw a ball around, complain about how cold/windy/whatever it is, make a big mess, clean it up, then go home. \n \n \n \nWe arrive home exhausted from our day at the beach, with a bunch of things to unpack, hose off, wipe and clean. \n \n \n \nThis year (yesterday) I only loaded $10 on each kid's card for the arcade. Rojo went straight to \"the claw\" where for 25 cents you can \"play 'til you win\" a pice of candy. The machine must not have been working properly, because 10 minutes in he still had $9.75 on the card. I didn't complain. When he had a whole sweatshirt pocket full of gross candy, he headed for the Big Bass Wheel. He swiped his card (actually, I helped him), pulled the handle down nonchalantly, then while being totally distracted trying to get a piece of candy from his pocket, he won 1,000 tickets. He was mildly impressed, the three of us were beside ourselves. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter waiting an eternity for the machine to punch out 1,000 tickets, we decided to break from our tradition of giving away the tickets, and instead, went to the redemption counter and squandered all 1,000 on mostly MORE gross candy (and a Frisbee for Flicka). \n \nBecause both kids still had a ton of money left on their cards, the four of us played basketball, skee ball, rode on motorcycles, and had a ball. We gathered up a bunch more tickets in the process, and decided we would then return to our tradition. We looked around for an unsuspecting family to whom we wanted to give the tickets. Soon as we spotted a dad following a four-year-old boy with Down Syndrome all around the arcade while his two daughters played, we looked no further. The dad was so excited he almost cried. \n \nWe were the big winners. \n \nThen we headed for Pig-n-Pancake and ate both. Rojo had a side of fries (and a bottle of ketchup). Ate every last one of them. STM did something totally out of character, at lunch he suggested we also go out to dinner. He had a place in mind. As soon as Rojo was assured there would be French fries there, too, he was in. \n \nOver for the salt-water taffy (because we didn't have enough candy), and that, too, was fun and easy. No crowd, they had all his favorite flavors, and I got out of there for less than $5.00. \n \nOff to the beach and we had fun watching Flicka have fun with her new Frisbee. She hardly ever plays, and it was so cute to see her run, fetch, dive into the water, roll around in the sand and just be a dog. \n \nAfter about three hours having fun on a pretty chilly day, we packed up and went to dinner. For the second time in one day, the four of us sat around a table and enjoyed food and conversation with one another. I don't think we've eaten out together two times in two years (or maybe more like 5). \n \nOn the way home everyone (but the driver) fell asleep, and we enjoyed a quiet, relaxing drive home, plus, since we'd eaten there we not only missed the rush hour traffic coming back, but everyone was full and ready for bed. \n \nSuccess all the way around.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d2rKPMwfPK8/UCLmut2KfrI/AAAAAAAAA34/M_JRHJY1L_U/s1600/IMG_3622.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--DftO5PG9EE/UCLm3m7edrI/AAAAAAAAA4E/yPFzqreMhKo/s1600/IMG_3623.JPG"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2012/08/a-day-at-beach.html", "title": "\nA Day at the Beach\n"},

I asked him how much he liked camp on a scale from 1-10, he said, \"3.\" \n \nWe drove straight to the frozen yogurt place before even coming home and putting on cooler clothing, he didn't have his usual two bowls, only one, and still he was not quite himself. He went straight for the TV/iPad combination and relaxed for awhile, then he was all about riding his bike to visit friends, seeing if there were dogs at the park, and going to the Little Store to buy stuff all on his own. When I mentioned I had to walk up there later he said, \"Just tell me what you need and I'll get it for you.\" HUGE! AND, he did!

Rojo didn't love camp. He missed us, his favorite foods, routines, TV, dog, bike, friends. He was pushed way out of his comfort zone. He wasn't very gracious or happy about it some of the time.

Go ahead, take a moment and let that soak in. \n \nWe've been psyching him up for a full year, and not once has he said, \"You know, I don't want to go to camp,\" or \"I'm scared to go to camp,\" or \"Why do I have to go to camp?\" Today he was SO extra super duper hyper it was unbelievable. He kept talking about his counselor, \"Steve Bennett,\" a name he dubbed him for no apparent reason. Because I thought the counselors slept in the room with the kids, I assumed the boys would have boys and the girls would have girls. He's been talking about his boy counselor that he's going to have for months. \n \nSo, of course, he got a girl. Turns out his cabin mates are all boys, but the counselors sleep OUTSIDE of the cabins, to make sure kids don't wake up and sleep walk/wander off/etc. Anyway, the counselor is his 1:1 for the whole time, and she could not be any sweeter. Ruby. Don't you love that name? Ruby is 23, has been married 5 years, has a 1-and-a-half-year-old and is pregnant with number two. She works and goes to college and this is something she's doing (just for 2 weeks) for college. She wants to work with people with disabilities when she graduates. Ruby was sent straight from heaven. \n \nWe have been talking about this camp and how it's for kids with disabilities - all kinds - and how everyone will have a counselor to themselves, and so will he. Still, I don't think he connects the dots and realizes he has a disability. They talk openly in his school about it, we talk openly with him and around him about it, yet still, I just don't think he thinks he does. His eyes were huge when we got there and in the parking lot parents were pulling out the wheel chairs. (So humbling.) There were kids with disabilities that were obvious and some that were not. Mostly boys, I think I only saw a couple of girls. As STM said when we left, \"We have so much in common with all the parents there, yet no time to try to connect with them, because we're all busy doing what we have in common.\" \n \nMost of the kids are repeat campers, I think Rojo might be one of the few that is there for the very first time, and perhaps the only one really away from home for the first time (besides grandparents' houses and his one night at Outdoor School three years ago, and a night at the liz's). When we went through the line of the Behaviorist, she noted that this was an awfully big deal, and asked what would comfort him if he got anxious. He said, \"swimming,\" (that's a whole post for another time right there). Since swimming isn't really reasonable I suggested time with Elmo. Ruby said, \"Oh, my son loves Elmo!\" I forgive you for pointing out that your BABY loves Elmo, because I know you are still learning, Ruby, and you mean well, and you want my son to be happy, safe and comfortable, and that is all that really matters. But still. \n \nWe finished the long check-in process, answered questions the Speech Path had (he's giving Rojo a printed schedule each day so he will know what's going on), and the nurse, we unloaded all his stuff, found him a bunk, and said our goodbyes. He was being brave when we left but I could tell he was processing a lot. \n \nI was processing more. STM and I drove straight to the closest pub for a beer and a burger before climbing back down the mountain. After checking my cell phone for the umpteenth time to make sure it would both vibrate and ring should they call, I looked up and there was a sign in someone's yard that simply said, \"God provides.\" \n \nAmen.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2012/07/a-sign.html", "title": "\nA Sign\n"},

No sir, I do not. Tell me who you are if you want me to talk to you (and even then I probably wouldn't answer your call, what with the phone phobia and all).

{"date": "Thursday, May 10, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nSo, when Rojo turned 15 last July, we got him a cell phone. Said cell phone promptly got named, Casper, and became an appendage. Rojo was never without it except to sleep, where it then lay on the kitchen counter charging, so he'd have it bright and EARLY the next morning. We had to set up some rules, \"Don't text ANYONE more than 5 times a day.\" (I believe Nancy holds the record at 62 texts in one day. Most of them the same text sent multiple times, as she had the audacity to be driving when he wanted her Right. That. Minute.) Another rule was, \"No texting before 7:00 AM on the weekdays, and 8:00 AM on the weekends.\" \n \nThe point of him having a phone was to be able to reach him when he was over at the dog park, and for him to be able to reach us, should there be a problem. For the most part, he is excellent about responding to our calls and texts, but there have been times when he's had it on silent, \"So nobody would bother him,\" thus, completely making the whole point of having a cell phone, well, pointless. \n \nWe were smart and bought the insurance for Casper, knowing that the reality was, the phone was going to get lost, broken, or dropped in a toilet. We had several 24-hour periods where Casper went missing, always to be found by me, of course, in the most unlikely places. \n \nLast Friday I picked Rojo up from school and he had Casper. He told me the weather forecast for the next 5 days. He told me the frozen yogurt flavors they posted on his favorite place's Website. He texted his friends. He had the flippin' phone. Then it disappeared. Completely went missing. We checked the car. Three times each. We moved seats, pulled out all the crap in there and tore the thing apart - no phone. We/I tore the house apart. Under beds, every drawer, closet and cupboard, behind cushions, you name it. No Casper. \n \nI told him it had to be missing three days before ordering him a new phone. On day #4 I called, plunked down the $45 replacement fee, and was instructed it would be at our house between 7 AM and 6 PM the next day - and a signature would be required to receive it. I cleared my calendar. I stayed home all damn day. I didn't even go in the backyard to pull weeds in case the doorbell rang and I didn't hear it. I showered and dried my hair prior to 7 just so that wouldn't interfere with anything. I cancelled my walk with a friend. I arranged someone else to pick up Rojo and his friend from school. Finally, about 3:00 PM UPS came, I ran to meet the driver. He handed me the package and jumped back in his truck. \n \n\"What? No signature? That's it? I can just have it?\" \n \n\"No, you're all good,\" he said. \n \nGrrrrrrr... \n \nI set about activating the new phone, entering in all the contact information I had in my phone, that I knew he'd want in his. When he got home from school it was all ready to go. \"Oh, Jasper, you're here! I love you, Jasper!\" He immediately took Jasper and headed down to see his dogs and their owners. \n \nYesterday, I had to give STM's parents a ride in my car, and I opened up the back door and moved the towel that is in there for Flicka to lie on, and there was the flippin' phone.

Just like that. \n \nIt's silly to get all worked up about a lost cell phone and the better part of a week spent looking for it.

For whatever reason (and believe me, I've given this WAY too much thought), in the last few months there have been an alarmingly high number of abandoned dog poop bags in our neighborhood. I don't get it - you walk your dog, you've bothered to bring a bag in the  first \u00a0place, you've scooped it up, turned the bag carefully inside out, tied a knot in the bag, and THEN you just put the bag somewhere  else ?

He had autism. \n \nHis hat was always with him. \n \nHis hat was lost one day. \n \nNow he had no way of telling them his stories. \n \nHis mom and dad became sad. \n \nThey taught him spelling on a letterboard. \n \nIt was hard. \n \nEnd. \n \n \n \nby Keli Thorsteinsson \n \nSimon & Schuster contacted me awhile back, told me a little about a new book, THE GOLDEN HAT, \u00a0and asked if I would be willing to take a look. I was honored to do so, especially after knowing my friend Arthur, and the story of his daughter  Carly \u00a0finding her voice that autism had kept locked away for years. \n \nIt all started when Kate Winslet met a mother and son, Margret and Keli, while doing the voice-over work for their movie,\u00a0 A Mother's Courage . Keli has nonverbal autism, and Kate was so moved by their story, she and Margret stayed in touch. One night after her kids were asleep, Kate went to brush her teeth and a great idea popped in her head: she would ask celebrities to don her hat, take a picture of themselves wearing it, and \"Think about the fact that many individuals with nonverbal autism have never been able to communicate. Now express something that's important to you; this quote will be included in the book.\" \n \nA huge and impressive list of celebrities put on the hat, took the self-portrait, and (most of them) included a quote. Many did express something important to them. Reese Witherspoon, already a favorite of mine, wrote, \"Love one another...\" Kate herself wrote, \"I'm here and I love you.\" Jude Law wrote, \"What a wonderful world.\" Brigitte Lacombe said, \"Be kind.\" \n \nSome wrote bizarre things and I'll be honest, it lowered my respect for them. I appreciate that they are helping a good cause (more on that in a minute), but it boggles my mind that they don't have more important things to say than, \"Get off my property,\" (Woody Allen), or \"Knock, knock... who's there?\" (Ethan Hawke). I guess I find it insulting, as though they aren't taking it seriously enough, making it all about them - getting the laugh, the attention, the glory. \n \nThis is serious business. My favorite part of the book is the section featuring people with nonverbal autism (including Carly),\u00a0and the first words they communicated (and the age at which they did so), through augmentative communication devices. Margret's son Keli's first words at age ten, were, \"I am real.\" I needed the celebrities in the book to get that, and many did, but many did not. These are real people, every bit as important, every bit as impressive, every bit as deserving of attention and praise. \n \nMore. \n \nOne boy was asked by his mother, \"What have you been doing all these years?\" and the first word he communicated (age nine) was, \"Listening.\" A girl that started communicating at age eight said first, \"I don't like flattery.\" \n \nThese people are here to teach. \n \n The Golden Hat Foundation \u00a0raises money to create housing for adults affected by autism, a cause near and dear to my heart.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 28, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nEven STM agrees, it's time to replace the slipcovers for our furniture in the \"reading room,\" aka, the iPad/Flicka room. Since we don't dine, our \"dining room\" has a love seat, big chair and an ottoman in it, two little end tables and a plant. Smallest room in the house. We spend 90% of our family time in it. I spend 90% of my  life  in it, and have all the technology a girl could want, right at my fingertips: iPad, MacBook, cell phone, cordless landline phone, chargers and cords going every which way. I may never leave this room. The kitchen is just right there, every book I'm in even considering reading is stacked on the table, my reading glasses, calendar, pencil and coaster for my coffee - all right there. If I could just get STM to move the washer/dryer in here too, I'd really be set. \n \nBack to the slipcovers. When we moved into the house before this one, almost fourteen years ago, we bought these pieces of furniture for the then family room. We washed the slipcovers that came with them so many times they were trashed in six months. We had them replaced with custom made denim ones, and they've been rock stars. But, two kids, a dog, misuse of Sharpies, years and years (and years) of diaper changes on the ottoman later, they are, well, let's just call a spade a spade, gross. They are faded. They are ill fitting. They are threadbare. They are stained. In places they even have holes.

I held a gun to her head to apply to the colleges. The acceptances came. Now here we are with just a little over a month left until the drop dead date colleges impose (May 1st) to get in or get out, and she still hasn't decided. \n \nThis indecision was doing nothing for our relationship.

God knows there are at least 40 extra \"things\" lying around here, despite the fact I donate a huge bag at least once or twice a month. There's always more than we need, and that just ain't right. I'm all for having everything we need, but do I \"need\" 20 purses? 18 of which I haven't used in years/decades?

I had little valentines for everyone and Rojo had made cards he was super excited to give. I'd helped him, but when it came to do mine, he wouldn't let me look, instead, grabbing the card and putting it in the envelope himself, then asking me to hide it so I wouldn't find it. He did not disappoint. He never does. Feels good to be loved dearly much. \n \nSTM had given me a dozen red roses over the weekend - wanting to beat the rush and making sure they didn't run out, then thought it was silly to hide them until Tuesday, so gave them to me early to enjoy, which I did. Nice to stretch it all out, I say. Birth \"day\" just isn't enough. I require a full week. STM also gave me a jigsaw puzzle, suggesting it might be nice to get back to that old past time of mine (and give Rojo back his iPad). Woohoo gave me really sweet and thoughtful gifts, too. \n \nKathleen made an early morning drop off of balloons, tulips (my fave), a bottle of yummy wine and running gloves which I'd asked for. NEHBM of getting what you ask for. Got the kids out the door and then STM and I took Flicka on a really nice walk, getting home right before it started to pour. He left, I had fun cleaning up and doing things I love like starting the dishwasher AND the washing machine at the same time, which never fails to give me a neurotic sense of joy. \n \nThen I marched myself down to the closest Starbucks and redeemed my free birthday drink - grande mocha, full fat, with whip. Ran into our friend Tom there and enjoyed a visit with him. Came home with my drink, curled up in the chair-and-a-half with Flicka, got out the iPad and played solitaire, while taking phone calls and texts from friends far and wide wishing me happy birthday. \n \nGot picked up at 1:00 by Nancy, who gave me some lovely (but too personal to mention) gifts, and drove me to have lunch with Kathleen and our friend Diane - the birthday group. We lingered so long that I only had a little while to freshen up before going to dinner with STM! We went to our favorite haunt, ordered exactly what we always do, sat in our favorite booth, and had a leisurely, delightful meal and conversation. \n \nCame home to a house with no Woohoo, no Rojo, no Flicka, and did what anyone else would do under those circumstances - went right into the DVR recording of \"The Bachelor\" from the previous night. \n \nJust a day filled with love and special people from beginning to end.

As an extra bonus, I planned my trip to route through Minneapolis/St. Paul with a long layover. My agent lives there, and we were able to have a delightful two hours together catching up, laughing, talking shop and just enjoying each other's company. Super fun. She is full of good ideas and determination to get this book \"out.\" If anyone can, she can! Go ahead and light the Marys, though, if you're so inclined. \"Let it be,\" is my prayer for the book. Whatever \"be\" is. I no longer MUST have it published to consider myself a \"real\" writer. By the same token, I am no longer holding it back energetically because I'm afraid. I've let it go. And it feels great. \n \n \nTerry and I had 3 full days together. We slept in, drank excellent coffee from carefully selected mugs, went for long walks, showered about 2 PM and then started Wine O'Clock by 5 (although in four nights we didn't even finish 2 bottles). Really, it's just impossible not to have fun when you're with Toeless. Impossible. I laugh just thinking about her. And laugh we did. At one point we had that intoxicating can't catch your breath, can't stop howling, tears pouring down your face and snot running down your nose kind of five minute laugh. Your basic heavenly experience. \n \nWe did have plenty of HDRs, though, too, it wasn't solid hilarity. We actually got into it immediately when she picked me up from the airport, and she said, \"It's amazing what happens when you stop white knuckling it.\" She was talking about business, clients, making everyone happy, and I thought about how far I've come in being good with the outcome of my book. \n \nNot enough can be made of the fact that when I met Terry 17 years ago, she worried all the time about two things: her weight and money. Year after year during my visits these worries were ever-present, until a few years ago she consciously decided to stop fixating on her weight. She hasn't gained a pound since doing so. Then she let go of her anxiety around money - the scarcity mentality - gone. Poof. Her expenses have, and will, only go up (she has a son going to NYU in the fall). Her fear that there will not be enough, however, has only gone down. \n \nYou can read all the self-help books, listen to all the experts,  know  that it's true, but to behold it for yourself when you see a loved one profoundly lighter, is powerful.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DB00B9MLOWw/TzSb-s7-DBI/AAAAAAAAA0Q/38e4xinDNuE/s1600/Carrie-20110131.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2012/02/letting-go.html", "title": "\nLetting Go\n"},

He can tell you all about how hyper he gets without his meds, how it makes it hard for him to focus, how he's easily distracted, etc. He knows that learning is hard for him. He knows he's in a class where everyone needs extra help. He knows he's going to camp this summer where again, everyone has \"something\" and needs extra help.

Their friends like to jump, but even when they come over, they don't often make it out there, and let's face it, their friends are getting older, too. The trampoline was a great investment, it's been well used, and now it needs to go. \n \nWe're giving it to a young family we know from school and church. Actually, I wrote about my \"chance\" encounter with the father, Mike, and his two kids over a year ago, but I can't remember what I named that post, so can't find it for you - sorry. Maybe you'll remember, though, Flicka climbed up on the play structure at the park, and Mike's kids ended up taking Flicka for walks with the leash, and Mike and I struck up a conversation. Turns out we are both raising sons with special needs. Turns out he went home and Googled me, found my blog, found my e-mail address. Turns out his wife, Amy, is in my support group now, and we're all on our way to becoming BFFs, because, as you well know, there are no accidents. \n \nAmy and the kids came over to measure the trampoline and let the kids jump. We had texted Amy earlier in the afternoon to see if they could join us for frozen yogurt after jumping. Amy said they'd love to, but would it be okay if we went with Mike, because she had a doctor appointment, and she and Mike were going to switch at our house Rojo and I were both down with that idea. Rojo chatted Mike up one side and down the other, going so far as to invite their whole family to move to Disneyland with us when he graduates from high school (that plan is still very much in effect). \n \nAt yogurt we sat in five side-by-side stools, ate, visited, and then it became clear the kids were all done, and it was time to skedaddle. We walked them to their car, said goodbye, and no sooner had Rojo jumped into my car and buckled up, did he say, \"I like Mike. He's the right kind of man.\" \n \nBoth parents handled both kids beautifully - like they should write a book or teach parenting classes type of good. Rojo particularly related to Mike, I think, because he's the type of dad Rojo aspires to be. Whenever Rojo tells me about his future parenthood, it always includes him taking his kids out for ice cream. \n \nSome people take the jump into parenting. Some fall into it.

The reason is this: my writing planets are all out of whack. STM and I went for our annual check-in with our friend the astrologer, and she said it was all right there on my charts. \"This is not a time for writing. In fact, do you want to know  when \u00a0you're going to feel like writing again?\" Of course I did, and the answer was right there in her handy dandy book, \"September 19th. Until then, only write when the mood strikes you, and that might not be before September, and that's fine. There's just no wind behind that sail until then.\" \n \nAnd that's just exactly what it feels like to me, like there is just an occasional breeze, but no wind there. Problem is, there's not much breeze, let alone wind, behind anything lately for me. Apparently all that was on the chart, too. \"It's a period of rest for you. I know that's a four-letter word, but it's important that you take this time and do just that.\" \n \nIn the seventeen-and-a-half years I've been a parent, this is the first time I'm not racing through my days and nights breathless, racing to get it all done.

This is the first time I've sat with STM in the living room at night and watched whatever it is he's watching on TV (you don't even want to know). \n \nI told the astrologer that I felt like I should find something more useful to do with my time, volunteer, start a project, plan for Rojo's transition to adulthood, something. She said that there was a force equally strong in my chart that wanted to learn new things, not for a degree or even for a career, but just for the pleasure of learning.

{"date": "Wednesday, January 11, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nWe did get Rojo an iPad for Christmas, and a friend of mine with one mentioned that solitaire was highly addicting, so, naturally, within ten minutes of her telling me that, I'd loaded that app and was well on my way to developing a problem. \n \nYou can play a game in 2-3 minutes, so easy to say, \"Oh, just one more...\" until pretty soon you've pissed away an hour or three. There must be something about the game that occupies the right hemisphere of the brain, allowing the left brain to be free to roam. I find myself getting almost trance-like while playing, deeply relaxed and reflective, rather than obsessive. Let's just say it's working for me - that's my story and I'm sticking with it. \n \nMy dad taught me how to play solitaire (and other card games). He had such a sharp mind, could always see and explain strategy, was always three steps ahead of me. I realize now, at almost 50, how exasperating I must have been for him - not as quick, not as ambitious, not as competitive, no matter how hard he tried to get me to be. When I finally made up my mind about where I was going to go to college and told him, he was underwhelmed. When I finally decided in my sophomore year I'd be a teacher, again, underwhelmed. I always felt like he was disappointed, that the bar was too high for me, that nothing I did made him happy. \n \nDuring my hours of solitaire, I've been able to see it a different way. As a woman now with a daughter choosing between the very college I went to and one that's \"better,\" I see how a parent could feel the way he did. No matter what she chooses she'll be fine, and I will not be disappointed, she can and does make me happy, and I hope she feels she clears the bar every day, all day long. It's just that I think she's great, and is headed for greatness, and want greatness for her. But what is \"greatness?\" \n \nAlthough I am a long way away from being the doctor my father hoped I'd be, don't have an impressive resume, haven't done a lot that the world might call \"great,\" my life has been, and is, indeed, great. I know that if my father were here he'd agree. I am happy. I have ALL my needs and damn near all my wants met. I have tons of people that love and care for me. I have laughter, I have health, I have, by all definitions that count, greatness. \n \nI'd say the iPad has already paid for itself.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.techsupportalert.com/files/images/flags/Solitaire.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2012/01/solitaire.html", "title": "\nSolitaire\n"},
{"date": "Monday, January 9, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nSo, it's been decided around here that Rojo is ready to try summer camp. My friends with older kids with different abilities recommended one in particular - a whole camp just for this very thing. Not cheap, but a week without Rojo is a vacation for the rest of us, and nowhere are we going to get a vacation for the cost of camp, and so, we justify. Plus, Sandy, the woman that runs the preschool Rojo worked at all summer (and four blessed days during Christmas vacation), suggested camp numerous times, and this one most enthusiastically. I've been psyching Rojo up for this for months, and have him sold. His only condition is that he be home on his birthday. \n \nMy friend Joan reminded me when online registration began and urged me to do it immediately, as the camp fills up in the first week, and people registering even a couple days after registration opens, are often put on the waiting list for the weeks they request. Joan gave me paperwork, e-mails, links, you-name-it, everything I would need to make sure I got my place in line, on line, on time. \n \nToday was the day. Had Post-its to remind me to set the alarm so I'd be up and fully caffeinated before the 6:00 opening of registration. I slept fitfully, looking at the clock several times in the night to make sure I hadn't over-slept. Woke up at 4:30 fully awake, lay there for half an hour, finally got up, caffed up, and booted up the computer. I was ready to click in all the right spots on the Website the minute the clock turned to 6:00:00. Did just that, and I was number 36 in line. Didn't even think about getting in line before 6:00, such a rule follower am I. I impatiently waited to move up in the virtual line, which thankfully only took about 5-6 minutes. I felt like I'd won the lottery when it said I was first in line, and then when the Website magically opened and had slots for me to enter information, I was on a high. Because I am notorious for being in a hurry and making careless mistakes, I was painstaking in my entering. I was just to the place where I was filling out emergency contact information, when suddenly the site put me back in the virtual line, this time, #76. I know I didn't push the browser or the refresh button, both which had been cautioned against. I just deleted a phone number that was incorrect (which the computer had automatically entered and I needed to substitute for right information), pressed \"tab\" and BOOM, to the back of the line I went. \n \nThe expletives flew. I put on pretty music, lighted the candles, did a few (shallow) cleansing breaths and tried to get myself right. Had to wait about 15 minutes to get back to my first place in line, and then JUST as the site opened up for me, BOOM, Safari quit unexpectedly. That has only happened to me a handful of times in the five years I've had this computer, and NEVER when I was doing something of significance (Facebook doesn't count). Oh, and let me back this up and tell you that at 5:00 Rojo was sound asleep and I had the quiet of the house. By 6:00 he was awake and thumping loudly, making the whole house pulse with his unmedicated hyperactivity and joy. By the time I got in line for the THIRD time (back to number 36), STM had left for work and he was ever-present with his uncontained joy. Let me just tell you, the LAST thing you want when you're trying to register your special needs child for camp, is the \"help\" of your special needs child. \n \n\"GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW, I'M TRYING TO REGISTER YOU FOR CAMP! IF I DON'T DO IT RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN'T GO!\" I shrieked. He took his joy and thumping and went and bothered Woohoo. I paced, I made the bed, I threw a load of laundry in, I brushed my teeth, neurotically checking the queue every 2 1/2 seconds. Finally, finally, just as Woohoo and Rojo had gotten themselves dressed and ready for school and were about to leave, I got on. I entered all the information (pages and pages of does he need help with this, that or the other thing questions), and submitted. RECEIVED! WOOHOO! Rushed downstairs and said goodbye to the kids. \"You need to play solitaire on my iPad,\" Rojo said, \"You need to calm down.\" \n \nHe's right. I'm going to make a cup of herbal tea, light another candle, breathe deeply, play a little solitaire, calm down, and thank God there is a camp so great that people are queued up to send their special needs child (ages 10-35) there. A place where campers go back year after year after year. A camp that campers say is their favorite week of their whole year. A place set up to accommodate them - make them feel successful and gain confidence. A place where they aren't special because they need help - everyone there needs help. They are special because they just are. \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0* Photo from http://pdx.edu\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://pdx.edu/sites/www.pdx.edu.sped/files/kiwanis-kayak.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2012/01/camp.html", "title": "\nCamp\n"},

Fortunately for our husbands, they are both compatible with us - good to know. STM is a pig, I am a rabbit. Sonam is also a rabbit. Her husband, my brother, is a goat. Woohoo is a dog, Rojo is a rat, Kunga is a rooster. My mother is a horse. It was amazing to see just how accurate they all were, except for STM's, he didn't really sound much like a typical pig (no comment). \n \nWe used\u00a0 this site \u00a0to calculate our sign.

Her mom can tell you all about the elements, all about compatibility, traits, luck, fortune, etc. Like I said, fascinating. \n \nSonam and I both had good 2011s, which was a rabbit year, so it makes sense that we rabbits would find \"luck\" in 2011. According to\u00a0 this , 2012 is going to be my lucky year, too, because I'm a not only a rabbit, but a water rabbit.

The thing about it is, when I was growing up I had an image of myself at 50, all \"grown up,\" and now that it's almost here, I am coming to terms with what is and is not accurate with that image. \n \n50-year-old Carrie would have a library in her house, one with the built-in ladder, four walls of nothing but books and a comfy chair. 50-year-old Carrie would have a music room with a grand piano, and she and her musically gifted children would all play it beautifully. 50-year-old Carrie would have \"real\" furniture - not just a mattress and box springs, but a proper bed. There would be matching night stands and dressers, a short one for my husband and a taller one for me. I'd have an office with a desk, credenza, doors that close and all kinds of really amazing things would come out of that room. I'd probably have my Ph.D in teaching, and be teaching teachers how to teach children - especially exceptional learners. I'd have traveled extensively, my passport having been stamped from all kinds of exotics lands. I'd have learned to cook, bought real art and had it properly framed, I'd have crystal and know how to pick out a bottle of wine. \n \n48-year-old almost 49-year-old Carrie is realizing, if she doesn't have it by now, hasn't done it by now, hasn't been there by now, she probably never will. It's not like I won't ever travel or learn something new, I might, but then again, I might not, and that's okay. I finally realized that what is gone is not the dream, but the  striving. \u00a0 I simply don't want to strive any more - not for things, not for adventure, not for accomplishments. \n \nAt almost 50 I want  less , not more. Less stuff. Less acquaintances. Less high-maintenance relationships. Less drama. Less obligations. Less busyness. Less involvements with things that aren't important to me. I'm all done forcing things. In fact, that reminds me of a Toeless Terry story - she had a friend going through a divorce, and she asked him why. He said, \"The woman forced flowers to bloom.\" I've never forgotten that (and I'm fairly sure there were bigger troubles in the marriage than forced flowers, but it does beg the question, what is the point in forcing things?). \n \nSo, I don't consider it being resigned, giving up, quitting, being lazy, any of that. I consider it being content with what I have. Letting things happen. Allowing. Accepting. Being grateful for what is, and not with my eyes on the horizon for what might be. \n \n \n* Photo from http://www.sitepoint.com\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/perfection.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2012/01/striving.html", "title": "\nStriving\n"},

If ever there was a year for the feminine divine to make a big comeback, it's 2012 - just sayin'. \n \nMy sister-in-law, Sonam, and nephew, Kunga, were up for the weekend.

And that's why we went to Hawaii, because it  is \u00a0a lot. We're proud of ourselves, and without over-sharing, I'll just say, we should be. \n \nWithout a doubt, one of the best moves we ever made, was going through\u00a0 RCIA \u00a0together, with Kathleen and her husband Jerry as our sponsors, and then joining the Church. It's not because it's Catholic. It's not because it's Christian. It's because it's an active, vital, loving, supportive community, right in our own backyard. It's our Cheers - a place where everyone knows our name, knows our story, loves and accepts us and supports us on our journey. \n \nSay what you want about the Catholics (and I've said it all, and some of it I continue to say, so go ahead), but they revere marriage, and I think that's a good thing. There is much to support the institution inherent in the Church - again, a good thing. STM and I decided to milk some of that goodness yesterday, when we received a blessing from our priest, following the daily morning Mass. We had wanted to mark our 20th in some spiritual way, and asked the priest if he'd perform a blessing. We found a day that worked for everyone, and STM and I went to 8:00 AM Mass yesterday, surrounded by the holy elders, and basked in their goodness and wisdom. After they all cleared out, three of our favorite humans, all of whom happen to work at the Parish Center, stayed behind. Because they know of my love for Mary, we moved over to a beautiful statue of her, prayer candles aflame below her feet, and the priest performed a beautiful blessing, complete with a \"You may kiss the bride,\" at the end. \n \nThe blessing came straight from the\u00a0 Book of Blessings , and it used the word \"fidelity\" several times. Both STM and I noticed, and talked about it later. Kathleen and I even dissected the word on our walk later that day. \"Of course we have fidelity,\" I said, \"we certainly don't have  in fidelity!\" But I realized even as I was boasting, that just because we don't have  that  kind of infidelity, doesn't mean we both can't clean up our acts. Merriam-Webster defines fidelity as the quality or state of being  faithful.  Faithful - full of faith. \n \nIsn't that, indeed, what a marriage needs to survive? Doesn't it need to be full of faith? Faith in each other? Faith in ourselves? And faith in something greater than ourselves? \n \n \n \n \n* Photo from www.stmatthewcath.org\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.stmatthewcath.org/images/rightPhoto/maryStatue.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_Christian_Initiation_of_Adults", "http://www.amazon.com/Book-Blessings-Ritual-Roman/dp/0814618758/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1325308187&sr=8-1"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/12/fidelity.html", "title": "\nFidelity\n"},

Sometimes it's great having a child that  obviously \u00a0is atypical, it makes me approachable to others feeling like they're the only one. \n \nOur group started with four people: the founder with a child with medical needs, two moms with kids that had mental health-related issues, and me. Eventually the founder moved out of the state and I took the reins. We now have an e-mail distribution list of almost 50, and generally have 12-15 people at our monthly meetings. Of those 12-15 we have our 10 or so \"core members,\" ones that come month after month after month, a few that come now and then, and almost always, someone new. We are all word of mouth and we now cover a wide range of different abilities, ASD, ADHD, mental illnesses, seizure disorders, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, you name it. I've lost track, but I think this is about our 7th or 8th year of being together. \n \nOne thing that has been coming up lately is the need for more support for the dads. We thought having a Christmas party might be a good ice breaker, get a bunch of the dads all in the same room, and just see if a men's group could evolve from that. By men's group I mean, going out for a few beers at the pub up the street. So, last night we had our party. It was awesome. We had people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s. We had those born and raised in this very neighborhood and those born in foreign lands. We had nurses, doctors and attorneys, flight attendants, teachers, receptionists and self-employed entrepreneurs. We had plenty of those that once worked outside the home until the day our child's needs became so great, that was no longer an option. We had those with one child and those with four. The one thing we  all \u00a0had in common, was at  least \u00a0one child with special needs (many have more than one). \n \nSTM said it was the best party he's ever been too - couldn't stop talking about what a great group of people. Many of the conversations  did \u00a0revolve around our children, but many did not. There were a lot of laughs and a couple teary eyes. There were exchanges of information, words of encouragement, and much, much grace. \n \nIt was amazing. \n \n \n* photo from http://www.chinese-symbols.com\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.chinese-symbols.com/chinese-symbols/g/grace.gif"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/12/amazing-grace.html", "title": "\nAmazing Grace\n"},

{"date": "Friday, December 16, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nBear in mind I have \"started\" (been in on the ground level, really, didn't technically start), exactly one. This is not a manual, but a what-worked-for-us list. \n \nIf you are the parent of a special needs child, you need support. Period. You also need resources and a good group will do both - offer resources and support! \n \n\u00a01. Find 2-3 other people that also have a kid with special needs, even if they aren't the same as your kid's. You know 2-3 more. You just do. If not, ask your doctor, therapist, kid's teacher/principal/counselor, you-name-it. \n \n\u00a02. Meet. Could be a coffee shop (don't recommend that - the walls have ears). Could be one person's house every time (I actually DO recommend this, and I'll tell you why in a minute). Could trade off houses. Pick a time that works for the initial group of people, and stick to that. Others will join the group and suggest times that would better work for them. This is a no-win. You will forever be rearranging your meetings, frustrating everyone, losing consistency, and never finding a perfect time. Don't apologize. \"We meet ________ from ________ to ___________.\" I do tell people that it's fine (and common) that people come late and/or leave early, whatever they need to do. \n \n\u00a03. Key is to meet when the kids aren't around. We meed the 2nd Friday of every month, 9-12 AM. Many of the moms do work. They arrange their schedules around this. I recognize this is not always possible, but you would be impressed with the lengths some of the women in our group go to. We (I) put out the schedule for the whole school year by September 1st, they block that time out and show up. \n \n\u00a04. Establish a strict what-is-said-in-the-room-stays-in-the-room, policy. This is key. If people feel like they can't be free to share, there is no point in having a group. I always e-mail a summary of our meetings and distribute it to the whole group, but never put on there anything personal or specific, just Websites, resources, etc. that were shared at the meeting, maybe even a question that someone in the group that wasn't there, could still answer. \n \n\u00a05. You kind of need one person to take charge, have all the information filter through, and keep everyone on track. A leader will rise. It may or may not be the person that gets the group going. \n \n\u00a06. Take an All Are Welcome approach. If someone comes to the group and wants to bring a friend/neighbor/relative/whatever the next time, always say yes. You can't control the size or formation of the group - this is organic and will take care of itself. \n \n\u00a07. Some people will come once, dump all their problems on you, and never return. This is not unusual. Likewise, some people will come many times before opening their mouths to speak. This is also not un usual, and is to be encouraged. They are feeling out the group, establishing trust and are sure to be invaluable \"members\" of the group. \n \n\u00a08. Sometimes have a topic and/or guest speaker, sometimes do not. I have found if we are too loosey goosey, or too all-business, it doesn't work. \n \n\u00a09. Each time a new person joins, do NOT go around the room and have everyone tell their whole story again. This will chew up ALL your time and the ones that are faithful and loyal and never miss, have to hear it over and over again. People will catch on. It doesn't matter anyway. You don't need the full story to be a strong support. \n \n10. We have considered, and even tried to start, sub-groups. ADD/ADHD, ASD, Down Syndrome, whatever you may have a lot of people coming for support for. We've never been able to get this off the ground for whatever reason. There is something nice about the group that is \"misc.\" Many of the people in our group ALSO attend specific group meetings, but they always like our group better. It can be pretty depressing when the whole meeting is about the same \"different ability\" - you hear the extremes and that can overwhelm and freak some people out. \n \n11. Keep the e-mail list blind copied. I JUST started doing this and wish I'd done it years ago. Not everyone needs to see a new name on the list and start to speculate what all is going on in THAT family! If they want to know who else is in the group, they are welcome to come to the meetings. \n \n12. I have found that it is more successful to just have all the meetings at my house every month. I make coffee and move the furniture around, someone almost always offers to bring treats, and if they don't, I open a bag of whatever is in the pantry and call it good. Some people that need the group most, are barely holding it together. If they think that eventually the group will need to meet at THEIR house, they may not even bother joining the group. Just like a natural leader will emerge, so, too, will someone that likes to host things at their house. Trust that this is true. Again, you could always meet somewhere where nobody is the host, but I think it's hard to talk about such personal issues, in a public place. \n \n13. We have twice as many names on the email list, as typically come to a meeting. That does not mean they aren't valuable and contributing. People have posed all kinds of questions to the group, all the way from, \"Do you know of a good math tutor?\" to \"What experiences have you had with Risperdal?\" The e-mail responses are helpful and varied. \n \n14. Have someone in the group be the recorder at the meetings (again, this could all be the same person that hosts and organizes, and communicates, but doesn't necessarily need to be). Keep track of all the great resources shared, and create a directory. It took me 7 years to figure that one out. Each time someone needed a good something-or-other, I was forever going back to the group to ask, AGAIN. We now have a many page document with names of acupuncturists, doctors, therapists, books, speech paths, Websites, etc. \n \n15. Try to keep the support on special needs. Invariably \"life\" will hit people in the group - death, divorce, foreclosure, health issues, all of that. While it's inevitable some of the discussions will also include all that's going on in a family, the group is really gathered for one very specific reason, and needs to stay focused on that. \n \n16. Don't meet in July or August because A) Your kids are home, B) Everyone's schedule is different, and C) It's good to have a break. \n \n \n* Photo from http://cureanxiety.com\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://cureanxiety.com/images/bipolar-disorder-support-group.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/12/how-to-start-your-own-support-group.html", "title": "\nHow to Start Your Own Support Group\n"},

Shop, shop, shop, wrap, wrap, wrap! Was lucky enough to be given a pass to the Nike Employee Store (thanks, Janell!) and went there today to get the last few things I needed. For. Myself. Yes, I am fully shopping for myself this year, too. Really excited about the Mary necklace I bought myself from my friend Candace - the incredible artist/jeweler/Mary lover that she is. Really excited about the cute rain jacket I got at Nike today (not that anyone in Portland, Oregon needs a rain jacket or anything). Really excited about the new dish towels I got. TWO packs. Yep. Come Christmas day at least six of the nasty old ones in the drawer are getting shit canned.

You can blame Nancy. She could hardly stand his 3-a-day snow cone habit this summer, full of nothing but sugar and empty calories. She persuaded him to try frozen yogurt, and now, many $$ a week later, I'd say she was successful! Nancy is Rojo's favorite guest to invite to join us, and because she's a trooper, goes at least a couple times a week with us. \n \nRojo goes through the self-serve section in record breaking time, making a \"graveyard\" of sorts, with at least a smidge of every flavor offered. Then I sprinkle graham cracker crumbles, Oreo crumbles and 2 gummy worms on top (per his request). Times two. he eats both giant bowls before I finish my modest-sized bowl. It doesn't matter if the temperature outside is 34 degrees. It doesn't matter if we're the only ones in the place, it doesn't matter if dinner is right around the corner, if Rojo had his way, he'd go to the frozen yogurt place every single day and twice on Sundays. \n \nI know Rojo's diet is terrible. Believe me, I know. But every year we inch it towards something \"better.\" I don't have any aspiration of it being \"healthy,\" just \"less toxic\" would be nice.

{"date": "Tuesday, December 6, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nFirst of all, I feel it's important to mention that I'm actually living my ideal life. All I ever dreamed of doing was being a wife and a mother, and being able to stay home and take care of the needs of my family. I used to think I'd get a job being a hotel maid, because there are few things in life that bring me more pleasure, than making a mess tidy. So, for me, an unexciting day of taking care of house and home, suits me just right. In fact, I was born for it. Which brings me to my next stream-of-consciousness (no time for well-crafted posts). \n \nYesterday was our annual visit to Santa. Rojo wouldn't dream of not visiting Santa, telling him what he wants (a bear like Max but with a proper nose, remember?), taking a name off the giving tree, finding a gift for that person, having a snack in the food court, then looking at Christmas lights on the way home. STM and Woohoo find it brutal. 99.99% of the population would find it brutal. It is, in fact, brutal. Standing in line with a bunch of babies, toddlers and some kids as old as six or seven, then us. Rojo is now 5'7 and fifteen. \n \nOur plan is always to hit the mall early in the month, and early in the afternoon (right after school). We arrived at 3:00 yesterday, and there was a long line already formed. I took one look at the family and decided I was the only one capable of snaking around the line, and that the others must start in on the giving tree portion of the evening. We separated, I stood in line and Rojo texted me every two and a half minutes for an update. Finally, when we were about four kids from the front, he joined me, meeting my new friends, four-year-old Jaden and his dad. \n \nThe 45 minutes in line had given me ample time to get to know Jaden and learn his family's story. Jaden's dad had lost his job, home and family all within two weeks of each other, several months ago. He was now living with his grandparents and had taken the bus there with Jaden to see Santa. He didn't know they'd charge for pictures. He didn't know there would be a small train tantalizing Jaden, but costing $3.50/person for a 3-5 minute ride (racket!). He didn't know that after hearing that story I just had to reach in my wallet and cough up enough money for the two of them to ride the train. After all, Jaden was all excited to ask Santa for a choo-choo train for Christmas. \n \nI didn't explain to Jaden's dad why a mother of a fifteen-year-old would be standing in line. When Rojo joined us I let Rojo speak for himself. \"Do you want to see the list I am giving to Santa?\" His earnest expression and obvious excitement (and belief) spoke for themselves. \n \n\"Sure,\" said the dad. \n \nRojo produced the list we'd made the day before and put in my purse so we'd be sure to have it for the big moment: \n \nTeddy Bear \nSlippers \nHat \nGloves \nMittens \nWarm boots \nMint candies \nFlavored shampoo \n \nAs the man handed the list back to Rojo and he moved up in line that much closer to the goal of seeing Santa, a realization fell upon me, \"I was born for this.\" It really doesn't bother me a bit standing there, holding hands with someone taller than me now, talking about flavored shampoo and teddy bears, reindeer and Santa. I'll take it. \n \nI would not make a good soccer mom. I am no good at cooking, entertaining, decorating, working outside the home, having a house full of kids here doing what a house full of kids do, basically all the things my friends are super good at. \n \nNo accidents. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/12/the_physics_of_santa_claus/Santa-In-Sleigh.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/12/born-for-it.html", "title": "\nBorn For It\n"},

The ones now facing the wall were all of him as a baby or toddler. I turned them around again, just to see what he'd do.

It's impossible to find a place in our home where you can forget he's also in the home. Impossible. \n \nOh, and did I tell you STM wants to get a motor home after Woohoo goes off to college, so STM, Rojo, Flicka and I can travel together in a space smaller than our kitchen? Days on end in close quarters? \"Ideally\" with two TVs, so the boys can each watch their shows and I guess I'll be somewhere with earplugs AND headphones, and a giant Margarita?

These are things that are in our future, too, but I am letting my blinders stay on until Rojo turns sixteen, maybe seventeen, before crossing those bridges I don't want to cross. \n \nWhen this friend finally got someone helpful on the phone (can you imagine the extent to which my phone phobia will flare up when I have to do  this?) , the kind woman on the other end asked, \"What is his current eligibility?\" My friend gave the initials that bring a tear to her eye and a choke to her throat each time, \"M.R.\" \n \n\"Well, we aren't going to use that term,\" she said, \"We'll use Developmentally Disabled.\" \n \nLater, I was sharing all this with another friend of mine that has closely walked my story with me, and who is the aunt of a fifteen-year-old with Down Syndrome. \"I like Intellectual Disability,\" she said kindly enough. At which point I bit her head off. \n \n\"I DON'T!\" I said. \"It's just another way of saying, 'not smart.'

Rojo still can't tie his shoes - probably never will, but that boy is a wiz on his phone and computer. Nobody taught him. He innately knew how to make them do what he wanted them to do. Technology makes sense to him. It works in a way his brain can get itself wrapped around. \n \nRojo has a spiritual intelligence I've never seen in another person. Ever.

They often ended up eating breakfast next to us, walking on the path next to us, you get the idea. Right away my A-dar went up when I saw their little girl, who was about six or seven. I can't even put my finger on it, it was just \"something\" about where her gaze was, how repetitive she was in what she said, \"Mom is sitting here,\" \"Don't sit there, Mom is sitting there, \"Mom is sitting there,\" \"That's where Mom will sit,\" etc. \n \nThe father finally said, \"I know, you've told me repeatedly.\" He didn't sound mad, he didn't sound super annoyed (I was), he sounded resigned.

Here's the thing about vacations - they're a good thing to take! Note to self: take one with spouse more than every 10 years. We went to Vegas for 3 days for our 10th anniversary, have had a night or two here and there since then, but have not been away for a whole week alone, for 18+ years. (Nine months exactly before Woohoo was born. Just sayin'.) \n \nIt's just a really nice thing to go away and remember why you ever thought getting married was such a hot idea to begin with. Thing is, I  like \u00a0STM. My love for him has never been in question, but it was really nice to just enjoy the heck out of his company. I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but once you have kids, it's so hard to keep the focus from totally being on them, and then throw a special need or two (or 12) in there, and well, it's easy to become co-parents of a special needs child, and not much else. \n \n \n \n \n \nEveryone keeps asking us what we did when we were in Maui. Here's the answer: a whole lot of nothing. We didn't go to \"do,\" we went to \"be.\" And \"be\" we did. We \"be'd\" at the beach, at the pool, on our balcony, on long walks and leisurely breakfasts. We did golf once (he golfed, I rode in the cart for an extra $35). We took nice drives around the island, did explore the other towns both near and far, but most of the time we just hung out. \n \nSTM read the Steve Jobs book cover-to-cover (it's a monster), and I read three paperbacks that were all wonderful. ( Shanghai Girls, Secret Daughter, The Miracles of Prato . Put all three on your To Read list, and don't forget  The Blood of Flowers , too.) \n \nWe slept 9 hours each night. We awoke before daybreak, got our coffee and sat on our balcony watching the sun come up. We had our beer and/or wine each evening at sunset and watched the glory of that. In a nutshell: pure heaven. \n \nAnd the kids. The kids had a ball without us. Woohoo said, \"No stress for a full week.\" Nobody asking her if she did this or that, nobody nagging. Somebody cooking sumptuous meals for her each night. Someone that let her take over our master bedroom and make it her own for a week. Someone that said, \"Sure!\" to whatever it was she wanted to do. \n \nRojo was blissed out, too. We only talked to him once for 2 seconds and had a couple of texts. He was too busy keeping our friend, liz, (you can call her the liz, but you can't capitalize her name) hopping. He had her going out for frozen yogurt, playing basketball in the living room while she played YouTube videos on her laptop to provide the appropriate accompanying music, listening to him play and sing church songs on the piano or keyboard, or just having \"conversations.\" \n \nWhen we got home it was 9:00 PM and we thought he was asleep. When we went up to check on him he was SOBBING in his bed. \"Rojo, what's wrong?\" \n \n\"This is liz's last day!\" he said through his cracking, crying, voice. \n \nI settled him down, went back to say goodbye to liz (and tell her how sad he was she was leaving), and when I went back he was crying even more - up out of his bed, pacing around the room frantically, in a total frenzy. \"My heart is BROKEN,\" he said. \"I have a sad life!\" \n \nOf course this tore me up inside and I couldn't sleep a wink that night, even after I saw he'd settled down and was sleeping peacefully. The next morning we discovered liz had left her cell phone charger at our house, so we dropped it off after school. Rojo didn't even want to get out of the car, I made him, he said his hello and goodbye and then was in a big hurry to get home and to the school yard before it got dark. \n \nliz e-mailed me the next day, \"If you're not lucky enough to be in the Rojo circle, you will never get why it makes total sense that he was crying his eyes out last night because I was leaving, but had absolutely no time for me today!\" Exactly! Nothing personal! You were here, I was sad you left. I processed all that. I'm over it. No baggage. No attachment. In the present. \n \nliz also wrote, \"Oh, my hell of God... Rojo and I are even more solidly connected than before. I want everyone to love me the way he does... deeply, no strings... no agenda. Thanks for the opportunity to be with someone who touches my soul in a way that no one else ever could.\" \n \nThank  you \u00a0liz for being the perfect person to make it all possible.

Love the music. Like some of the discussions. Do NOT like some of the discussions. You can take the girl out of the Protestant religion, but you can't take the Protestant religion out of the girl. \n \nTopic turned to Halloween, which precedes All Saints' Day, and then All Souls' Day. The woman on the radio urged us to be praying for all the souls in  purgatory . I snapped that radio off so fast it would have made your head spin - did not want to hear one WORD about purgatory, a concept I have always struggled with. \n \nGot to thinking, anything that made me react with that amount of energy, probably needed to be looked at a little more closely. Clicked it back on. Because there are no accidents, the whole conversation was about people's struggle to understand purgatory. \n \nI'm not pretending I understand it any better, but it did get my wheels turning. I, personally, don't believe there is a heaven \"up there,\" or a hell \"down there,\" I believe that they are states of mind, and there are those who have figured out how to achieve heaven on earth, and those for whom this alludes. It then stands to reason that there is an in between, too, a place of purification, a place of struggle, and mental anguish. Doesn't that sound a lot like life? Or at least periods in our life? Is it possible that we experience heaven, hell and purgatory over and over and over again, sometimes concurrently? \n \nThe Buddhists believe in Samsara - a cycle of birth and rebirth, until one finally breaks free through enlightenment and transcends the cycle to a state of Nirvana. I like this concept, or maybe just the words sit better with me. I like the notion of \"transcending,\" of breaking free from a cycle, be it lifetime after lifetime or just what feels like it, the issues we have that seem to haunt us and feel so old and ingrained we grow weary and doubtful we will ever transcend them. \n \nOn this All Souls; Day (Wednesday), I will light a candle for just that - all souls. May we all transcend. May we all move from a place of mental anguish and struggle.

I think most people assumed the DMV was closed on Columbus Day, so the crowd was thin and the wait blessedly short. He is fully IDd, now, all 5'6\" 92 lbs. of him. \n \nThen, Woohoo submitted her college application that has kept me up nights for months (needlessly, but nonetheless). Any of you wanting to light the Marys for that one, would sure be appreciated. Our hope and prayer is that she's accepted to this school - her first choice and ours, too. We think it is a good fit for her and one in which she can be successful. (The school has a radio station there dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Just sayin'.) \n \nLast, but not least, heard back from my agent last night that she likes all the changes I made to the book, and she's ready to go \"out\" with it. Again, light the Marys! A bestseller would be nice, but we really just want to the book to \"do\" whatever it is it is meant to do in the universe.

Rojo  lives \u00a0for spirit week(s), and fortunately for him, they are a plenty in his high school. This is already the second \"round.\" \n \nMonday was OSU/UO day, which was a no brainer for him (I actually hate that expression, don't know why I used it). He has a surplus of both OSU and UO T-shirts. The only bet was on which team he'd represent, since truly he's a \"platypus\" as we call them around here, half and half with parents from each of the rival colleges, and a fan of both, enemy of neither. He picked UO. No telling what pushed him in that direction. \n \nTuesday was Celebrity Day. I don't think he knows the meaning of the word \"celebrity,\" and certainly is not impressed by anyone that calls themselves a celebrity. I suggested we skip the day, as they are optional, anyway. \"No, he said, I know who I'll be. I'll be Wayne Newton.\" \n \nYou could have knocked me over with a feather. WAYNE NEWTON? Where in the world did he come up with THAT one??? I refused to kill myself trying to come up with a Wayne Newton costume in less than 12 hours, so I blew the whole thing off and thought it would just go away. Tuesday morning he came at me with a Sharpie and Scotch tape and wanted me to write, \"Hi, I'm Wayne Newton\" on the tape and put it on his T-shirt. Naturally, I did. Naturally, that made him Wayne Newton. Naturally, it worked for everyone else, too.\n \n \nToday is Red and Blue Day (school colors). Rojo is also \"singing\" with the choir at the Homecoming Mass, so he'll be wearing a red polo shirt with his black choir pants. I will be probably the only parent at the school Mass because I probably have the only high schooler that begged his mother to come and \"watch\" him sing. If he moves his lips even a little, it will be well worth it. \n \nThursday is Twin Day and he has worked it all out with one of his peer tutors to be twins. I think they are just wearing their T-shirts that have their high school's name on them. (Nothing could be more made than (most) boys and their lack of effort/attention/freak out they put into what they wear.) \n \nFriday is Color Day - each class has a color, freshman are orange. He'll be wearing... yes, that's right, an orange T-shirt!\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://dekerivers.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/wayne_newton_galler_01.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/10/spirit-week.html", "title": "\nSpirit Week\n"},

I can't wait to have her place needles wherever it is she places needles, and let them do their thing. I have heard it's very effective in treating anxiety, and that is music to my soon-to-have-needles-all-over-them-ears. \n \nIn the meantime, I am trying to be mindful of my breath and saying to myself, \"With this breath I calm my body...\" that is helpful. So is my favorite anxiety cure: distraction. I have decided that today is the day I  need \u00a0to create a directory for the support group I facilitate. Imagine the possibilities of six or even seven years worth of saved e-mails listing various naturopaths, speech paths, occupational therapists, neuropsychs, psychologists, psychiatrists, play therapists, social skills therapists, you-name-it. I can finally make a comprehensive list of who we have all used and liked and stop re-creating the wheel every time someone asks me, \"Do you know someone that....\" which is a question I get a lot. \n \nHad a conversation with a fellow anxiety \"sufferer\" today. There are some pros to having anxiety, most of us \"high strung\" individuals do get a shit load of stuff done in a day - so hard is it for us to do \"nothing.\" We find things to do that don't always need doing. Sometimes, in fact, they require un-doing because not only did they  not \u00a0need to be done, they  shouldn't  have been done. \n \nSTM is famous for looking at people like me and saying, \"You're not watching enough TV.\" Let's just say he  does \u00a0watch enough. He works like a dog when it's time to work, and he rests (like an old dog) when it's time to rest. A lesson I have failed to learn despite his many attempts. \n \nWe do have an awful lot of good bad TV stored on our DVR, perhaps tomorrow after acupuncture... can't talk now, gotta go put that on the To Do list. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n* Photo from http://www.grandstrandacupuncture.com\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.grandstrandacupuncture.com/files/6112/7255/2424/AcupunctureNeedlesAreSmall.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/10/acupuncture.html", "title": "\nAcupuncture\n"},

There are senior pictures to select for the yearbook, and we need to dig out the baby pictures and pick one of those, too. College Night was last night, and now is the time to get all the recommendations in, finish up that essay, submit applications left and right, visit colleges, etc... \n \nOne of my oldest and dearest friends, Ruth, has a daughter just a year older than Woohoo. She said last December to me, and I've thought of this a million times, \"Just call me next year and scream - I'll know it's you.\" \n \nAHHHHHHH!!! \n \nFirst of all, there are the 1,001 details that all need to get done really soon, not to mention the fact we have to figure out how we're even going to pay for college, but how is it possible that I my little girl is going off to college in ten months? HOW? I'm still driving the same car that took her to preschool, doesn't that automatically make her little? Will that car, indeed, drive her off to college? Probably. Where have the years gone? \n \nBetween a part-time job, a boyfriend, three AP classes and all this college stuff, she is BUSY. Already we hardly see her, which I guess is part of the natural order of things - by the time she actually leaves, it will be less dramatic, less painful, less upsetting, but nonetheless, just as poignant. \n \nAdding to the poignancy is the fact that we're only doing this once. Rojo will not be taking and retaking the SATs and the ACTs. He will not be filling out applications. He will not need a roommate and a meal plan. We know, as we pass through this milestone year, it will be the only time that we do. \n \nAnd that is the good news, because my old friend Anxiety, cannot do this twice. \n \nAnd that is the bad news, because my old friend, Anxiety, is stressing already about What's Next for Rojo Instead. \n \nHad our support group meeting at my house this morning. We talked about how we all struggle to enjoy the highs, fearing the lows. When things are even with our kids, when they are happy, in the right schools, have friends, healthy in all ways, we spend that time worrying about when they aren't, instead of celebrating that they are. \n \nWoohoo is going off to college in less than a year. That is to be celebrated. Although it feels like everyone I know has kids that are in college or college bound, I have to remember that that is not the real world. It is a privilege and an honor to be headed to college, not the norm. \n \nSo, instead of screaming, instead of complaining, instead of worrying, instead of every other lower vibrational emotion or reaction, I am going to count my many blessings, not the least of which is I have a daughter that will be ready for college and gets to go. \n \nPhoto from http://blog.syracuse.com/college\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.syracuse.com/college_impact/2008/04/080402_college.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/10/college.html", "title": "\nCollege\n"},

I didn't have facts. I had a  knowing \u00a0that what was good for Rojo, would be good for anyone helping Rojo. I guess I did have facts, I had 29 other kids that went through 1-8 grade with him, that I would say, without a doubt, are better for having done so. \n \nSo, I talked up peer tutors for years. I knew that Rojo would relish time with someone that was all about him, someone in his age bracket, someone \"typical,\" someone that for a specified amount of time each day, got to leave their \"normal\" life and immerse themselves in neuro-diversity. \n \nBlessedly, I didn't have much opposition, and a peer tutor program was developed. Rojo loves  everything \u00a0about his school and program, but by far, his favorite thing is the peer tutors. \n \nFriday night STM, Rojo and I went together to the first home football game. Woohoo went too, separately, and spent the evening with her friends, which is all good and the way it should be. We were there about 20 minutes and some kid I'd never laid eyes on before came up to Rojo, plunked himself down, and began to \"hang.\" Finally, I said, \"Rojo? Would you please introduce us to your friend?\" \n \nRojo did, and the young man (a senior) shook our hands warmly and firmly, using lots of ma'ams and sirs, \u00a0before resuming his spot right next to Rojo on the bleachers. Later, when they were off at the Snack Shack, one of Rojo's teachers walked over to us, looking for Rojo. I explained where he was. \"Oh, that's great. You'll love this story,\" she continued, \"I asked all the peer mentors to write me a reflection piece, and that young man said that before this program began, he didn't have any intention of going to college, he thought maybe he'd join the Marines. Now, however, after working with Rojo and his classmates, he's decided what he wants to do with his life is be a special ed. teacher.

After three months home with Rojo, the various ice cream truck songs and cell phone ring tones being hummed, sung, kicked and tapped non-stop, it's what I do so that I can keep on doing it. \n \nBecause last year we sold the house my mom had in Sisters, I didn't know what I was going to do to keep the tradition alive, and thus, my sanity, and thus, Rojo. My cousin Julie graciously offered me the use of their vacation home, and I very nearly took her up on it (and will in the future).

Plus, Kathleen and I have started walking in the afternoons when she gets off work, before I have to go get Rojo from school, and that has, what's that you say? thrown my routine off. Back-to-school has... drumroll... thrown my routine off. STM was doing Cycle Oregon all last week and that, well, as a matter of fact, yes, that has thrown my routine off.\u00a0Had one over the summer, and am now looking for a new one. \n \nThe guests are great - two sisters that are STM's first cousins, travelled all the way from Ohio and Indiana just to spend time with STM's family (and us). Lovely. It's kind of like having two extra Carries in the house, which obviously, is a good thing. \n \nThings continue to go really well for Rojo in his new school and new program. I'm knocking on wood pretty much 24/7 because everything is so great. I well up with tears of gratitude several times a day. Seriously. The communication between Rojo's teachers and me is excellent. No \"housekeeping\" issue too mundane for them to take seriously. Had a little tiny hiccup in choir as Rojo doesn't read music, has never sung WITH people before, and pretty much doesn't have a single solitary clue what's going on in there. Within 24-hours of the hiccup being identified, a solution was in place. Let me just say this, not only a solution, but divine intervention. The vice-principal found a senior that  happened \u00a0to have a free period when Rojo is in choir, and could serve as a peer tutor. He  happens  to have had choir before. He  just so happens \u00a0to have a middle school-aged brother on the spectrum and gets it. Oh, and he was  already thinking \u00a0he'd like to get involved in new program somehow - lend his help. Say it with me... \n \nWoohoo continues to own the place as a senior, and is kicking ass all over the place. Most days she takes Rojo to school and many days she's able to bring him home, too. Sometimes she drags him with her to run her various errands, or attend something after school, etc. The other day they didn't get home until 4:15. She looked like something the cat dragged in. Grabbing a snack she says, \"I'm out. I'm going in my room and not emerging. Taking Rojo to the mall really did me in.\" \n \nNo comment. \n \nWe've done all we can to separate her life/needs from his, let her have her life independently. I see this as a big transition year for her - for one year and one year only, they'll go to the same school, she will be his big sister in a way she hasn't been before, by design. She is assuming greater independence and at the same time, more responsibility. I think it's a good thing to prepare her for college/life. At least that's what I tell myself. \n \nSo, things are well here, blog, better than well... blessed. \n \nMore soon, \nCarrie \n \n \n* Photo from http://www.montini.org\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.montini.org/s/200/images/editor/choir.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/09/finding-new-routine.html", "title": "\nFinding a New Routine\n"},

Guess he really is a teenager, after all. \n \nSo, Woohoo was leaving at 7:15 sharp to get to school and take care of some things, and he needed to be ready to go. At 6:30 he was lounging (loudly). At 6:40 he was promising to come eat breakfast, but was making no moves towards having it happen. At 6:45 he was finally sitting at the breakfast bar, but was not eating. He was chatting. He was kicking to the beat of some song he was humming. He had his mouth engaged in ten different ways besides the one I needed it to be. \n \n\"Rojo, stop chatting and EAT!\" I finally said in exasperation. \n \nHe continued to chat. Pretty much to himself, I guess, because I was not engaging. \n \n\"There's no time for chit-chat, EAT!\" I said, now fully enraged. \n \n\"There's  always  time for chit-chat with a friend like  you ,\" he said, which of course made me laugh, which of course made him laugh, which of course gave his mouth one more thing to do besides eat. \n \nAfter we got done laughing, I resumed the drill sergeant role, shouting out, \"Eat! Eat! Just EAT!\" \n \n\"Jesus,\" he said,\"you're like a merry-go-round with the eat, eat, eat, when are you going to get off?\" \n \nSo, he finally ate, they finally left, I finally took the dog for a walk, and on the way I saw that my favorite sign maker was back at it. \"Make someone happy,\" it said.

In those couple minutes one of his\u00a0 favorite people \u00a0got dropped off and was walking into the building. Rojo didn't even glance back, he shot out of the car and was in that building, arm around the friend and marching forward. \n \nGot an e-mail from one of the lovely women that work in the building saying how much she enjoyed her conversation with Rojo that day, and marveled at how much his communication skills have improved in the three years she's known him. Then she thanked me for sending him there. He forced her to be in the present, and she appreciated that. She looked forward to more of what he would be teaching her. \n \nMy friend Val and I had a few minutes to catch up today and we talked again about how Rojo has no ego whatsoever. No vanity. No modesty. No self-consciousness. No doubt and no anxiety about how his needs will be met. He is clear he can't do a whole lot of things, and he trusts that whomever he asks to help him, will be more than happy to. This approach hasn't failed him yet. \n \nWhy do we struggle so to believe this universal truth, that help is abundant and all we have to do is ask? \n \nGot a good reminder of that recently. We are going to take Woohoo on an overnight trip to visit a college, and are leaving Rojo and Flicka home with a former teacher of his and her husband. Rojo was handled, but I worried about poor Flicka being home alone all day - she isn't used to that and doesn't like being alone. Finally reached out to someone that has told me numerous times she'd be happy to help with Flicka anytime, and guess what? She was happy to help out with Flicka - just like she said! Then she thanked ME for asking! \n \nThe message is clear. The universe is set up to be win:win. We ask, we receive. We give, we get. People are helped by helping.

Didn't just sit with that crossed off list and kiss the ground I walk on. I impetuously (we're not going to call it \"compulsively\") got out the paper and made a fresh list. \n \nSo, because not enough has been made of what I've been able to do this summer in between endless trips for snow cones, frozen yogurt, glazed donuts and talking/waiting/holding life in a freezing pattern about the ice cream truck, I decided to make a DONE! list. Read it and weep: \n \n1. Cleaned the garage \n \n2. Cleaned the outside toy box \n \n3. Re-organized the whole garbage/recycling system at our house, and replaced in newly cleaned garage \n \n4. Purged and re-organized the pantry \n \n5. Went through all drawers/cupboards in the kitchen and sorted, purged and re-organized. Now I have an  empty \u00a0cupboard (it's tiny, but still...) and an empty drawer. Makes me happy every time I open them and see  nothing \u00a0in there. \n \n6. Filled my car three times and hauled everything to Goodwill. The man's name that helps me there is Solomon. Say it with me, NO ACCIDENTS! \n \n7. Filled my car innumerable times and went to the recycling center. \n \n8. Filled my whole car with old and rusted shut paint cans and took them to the hazardous waste site. Guy that helped me saw the sticker on my car with the name of my kids' school and his wife works there. Totally know her. Say it with me... \n \n9. Found a stack of old e-mails that will help my cousin write her memoir. Not only found them, but sent them to her. She was excited. I was more excited. \n \n10. Cleaned my medicine cupboard. Praised God we don't need 1/2 the stuff in there we at one point needed. \n \n11. Cleaned the attic crawl space and made it a place for luggage. Either need to start going places or purge the luggage, too. \n \n12. Got rid of everything that Rojo doesn't use or doesn't fit him anymore. Took all the faded, tattered posters off his wall and hung up crosses, framed collages and his Baptismal gown, instead. A holy person should live in a holy room, don't you think? \n \n13. The minute Woohoo left for three weeks in June, I hyper-organized her room. Instead of being mad I touched her stuff, she was grateful for the big head start, and has managed to sort of keep it that way. \n \n14. Got rid of most of the clothes that don't fit me. If I got rid of  everything \u00a0that doesn't properly fit, I'd have five things to wear. \n \n15. Got out all the artwork with broken glass, removed (and recycled) it, then reworked some frames/glass/art and re-hung in different places. \n \n16. Weeded the yard within an inch of its life and then sort of kept it up the rest of the summer. \n \n17. Built myself three new Target cabinets for our bathroom and hauled the nasty ones away. \n \nAnd, tomorrow I will haul two giant tubs of paper that needs to be shredded to my local UPS. Was already planning on going to that UPS to make a return ANYWAY, then with a few clicks of the computer learned that it is also a contracted shredding center.

{"date": "Wednesday, September 7, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nSo, approximately two million details went into the first day of high school for Rojo. We're talking years. We're talking about meetings, lists, e-mails, binders of information, more meetings, more e-mails, more years, more lists, more, more, more. Thought I'd considered everything. \n \nMonday afternoon I realized Rojo was going to need PE shoes for the next day. The next day. As in, the next one after that one. This is the kind of thing that would  normally \u00a0have been on my July list of things to do, but instead, it was on my Right This Minute List. Because he can't tie his shoes, it's not just a matter of running out and getting some. I twisted STM's arm, and dragged him to the Nike Factory Store (thank you, Nike, for being local and having an outlet a few miles away). We were there the day before school doing last minute shopping with all the other people doing the same thing. And it was hot. And I was freaking out. And I had my doubts about whether or not we'd find cool shoes with Velcro, in his size, at an outlet store, the very moment we needed them. \n \nBut, you already know the end of this story, right? They had one pair. Perfect. His size. Velcro. And not only were they already marked down because they were at the Factory Store, but they were on sale, too. Probably would have been full price if I'd bought them in July. I was rewarded for waiting. I was rewarded for not stressing about the PE shoes until I needed to focus on the PE shoes. I had a need and the universe swiftly and compassionately met the need. \n \nSo, Tuesday morning Rojo and Woohoo got up, had breakfast, got dressed, and were out the door by 7:15. I got a couple e-mails from different people at school saying Rojo was having a great day. My head and heart believed that, my stomach had a different idea. I inefficiently (and maniacally) flitted about all day, finally getting Flicka and going outside to wait for them to drive home way before they could possibly be driving home. \n \nThe car pulled up, and just as Rojo was getting out, an older man and his dog walked by. \"Oh, hi, Jerry, hi, Phinneas,\" Rojo says. \n \n\"Hi, Rojo,\" says the man I now know to be Jerry. \"How was your first day of high school?\" So, I got to hear Rojo's stories as he told them to a man I'd never laid eyes on before, but whom clearly loves my boy and is invested in him. \n \nAs Jerry (finally) left, he turned to me and said, \"I really enjoy my talks with Rojo at the dog park in the mornings. I'm going to miss them. I hope he'll come on the weekends.\" \n \nYou better believe it, Jerry. \n \nRojo told me all about history - loved his teacher. Loved all his teachers, actually. Didn't use his locker. Didn't remember to get food from the cafeteria like we'd talked about, but did remember that I'd packed snacks, so ate those during lunch. Did go to the restroom when prompted. Did have different buddies assigned to help him for various things. Did have every teacher/staff member/administrator looking on and out for him. Did bring more than one person to tears by how darn cute and sweet he is. \n \nRested at home for half an hour, peed, ate a snack, drank a ton of water (hadn't all day), then was ready to head right back to school for volleyball. We headed straight for the Snack Shack and announced to the two dads working there (one of whom is Rojo's godfather, Tom, the other the father of one of Rojo's mentors - no accidents), that we'd be helping. We sold Gatorade, water, and popcorn for a full hour, with about a million people coming in to say, \"Hi, Rojo!\" Both people I recognized, and those that I didn't. \n \nThen our friend J. came into the Snack Shack (I've blogged a lot about this special young man). He is also in the new program at the high school. He was positively beaming. He was talking so fast and so excitedly I could hardly understand him. Didn't need words to get that the boy had had a great first day. He, too, had come back for more. J's mom came in - she was checking to see if I could keep an eye on J. while she ran to Target. \"Sure, buy me a lock for Rojo's PE locker - you'll know what to get, one that he can manage.\" So she did. Meanwhile J. had worked out an alternative ride home for himself from another mom in our village. He was set to stay longer than his mom could, and had no problem being at the school indefinitely. \n \nSat between the two special boys on the bench and watched/listened as one person after another came to say hi to them. Little kids. Students. Siblings of their friends. Parents. Staff/teachers. All of a sudden the day(s) caught up with Rojo and he looked exhausted. \"Rojo, you look tired, are you ready to go?\" \n \n\"Yea, let's do,\" he said. On the way home he told me all about how the boys have five minutes to shower after PE. He's all excited about that. Had I thought about that before, I'd have lost several nights sleep, but because it (like the shoes), failed to reach my radar, it also failed to freak me out. He's not modest, he's full of belief that that, like everything else, will go just great for him. \n \nWhen we got home there was a voicemail - friend of STM's wanted him to call him back. Turns out the man wanted to tell us that Rojo and Woohoo had been the topic of their dinner conversation that night. This man's daughter, Woohoo's friend, caught Woohoo walking hand-in-hand with Rojo out of the building when it was time to leave Tuesday afternoon. The friend told her family all about how proud and protective Woohoo is of her little brother, and that the whole school knows not to mess with him, or they mess with her (all 110 lbs. of her). \n \nIt was a great day. \n \nToday was Late Start, Rojo didn't have to be there until 9:40. Woohoo left early to meet her boyfriend for coffee first (how grown up does  that \u00a0sound), so I said I'd take him - had to run errands out that way, anyway. Thought we'd leave about 9:15, get him there with time to spare, but not too much. Long about 9:00 he shouts up to me as I'm finishing getting ready and says, \"Care? You ready to hit the road? I want to get to school and see my friends.\" \n \n \n \n \n* Photo from http://www.angelamaiers.com\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.angelamaiers.com/images/2011/08/happy_first_day_of_school_card-p137598077267411672q53o_400.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/09/off-to-great-start.html", "title": "\nOff to a Great Start!\n"},

It is in a pile right next to my desk taunting me, but nothing about it beckons me. Quite the opposite. Instead I am knee deep into a complete purging of all the extra stuff in my house. No drawer is safe. No closet. No nook. No cranny. Today I will go drop off two large shelves worth of old paint at the hazardous waste site, wash those shelves like there's no tomorrow, and be blissed out as I put freshly reorganized totes in their place. \n \nAll the while I sort, toss, haul, and wipe, I am listening to soothing music and lost in my thoughts. It's a good lost. It's actually, the best kind of lost. It's a mindlessness kind of thinking, much more like meditation than anything else. And as I go through old things, I see that I am truly done with them, and that is healing. Done with taxes that go back to 1999. Done with different phases and eras of my life I don't care ever to go back to. Done with projects I thought I'd finish but have freed myself from ever needing to. Done with some of the boxes that hold hard times, too: all the paperwork that went with my father's death. All the different information on therapies we tried or considered trying. All the ventures I toyed with that didn't pan out. \n \nDone. \n \nIt's time to make my house, and especially the basement, no longer a graveyard. No longer a place where things that are over, are stored forever. Keepsakes need to move. Junk needs to move. The energy needs to move. \n \nWhat I am finding as more goes out the door, is that new reservoirs of my own energy and creativity are freed up, too. I am no longer considering the purging to be writing avoidance, but pre-writing. A necessary step towards being in a place where I can allow more in, because I released a bunch.

I vacillate between, \"Yea! Finally!\" to \"OMG, I hope they aren't sorry! This is a lot of responsibility! I sold them a bill of goods!\" \n \nThen there's the fact that Woohoo starts her senior year of high school, and this will be the one and only year they'll be together there. While doing some preliminary clearing in the basement, I found the scrapbook I made of her K-8 years. (It is the one and only scrapbook I've ever in my life made.) It's true what they say, the years fly by. Soon she will be out the door and on to college, and life under our roof will never look the same for her, for us, forever. \n \nAs rough as this summer began, it has ended up being lovely. Rojo has gained so much independence and maturity, he needs me a fraction of what he started out needing, which is to say, a round-the-clock playmate/entertainer/driver/etc. He gives me several breaks a day and if the weather stayed lovely and he could \"work\" four hours a day and spend the rest at the dog park, he'd be happy, and so would I. It makes me think of all kinds of jobs that would be perfect for him after high school, and realize I don't need him to be gone all day every day, just consistently so we both have routine and breathers. \n \nI asked him this weekend how he was feeling about high school. \"Are you excited? Are you scared?\" \n \n\"Each of both,\" he said. \n \nMy friend Terry has a family expression, \"Each of each.\" When asked, \"Do you want ice cream or pie?\" and the answer is you would really go for a little of both, the answer to such (silly) questions is, \"Each of each.\" I've been thinking a lot about that expression and Rojo's new Rojo-ism, \"each of both,\" and thinking just how apt they are. It's not one or the other. It's not even simply \"both.\" It's each of both, each of each. \n \n \n\u00a0* Photo from http://www.makeuptalk.com\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.makeuptalk.com/beautyblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/backtoschool.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/08/each-of-each.html", "title": "\nEach of Each\n"},

{"date": "Friday, August 19, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Those of you that read this blog know I love. Michelle O'Neil. I love Michelle and everything about Michelle. She is my human. I don't have heros, I have certain humans that I wholly admire for their amazing ability to be human. She is a shining example of such a human. She is a wonderful wife, mother, friend and writer. Her writing speaks to me in a way few other writer's words do. \n \n I have had the privilege of journeying through with Michelle on her memoir-writing path since 2006. I even got to read a much earlier draft of this book, which has come so far and is such an example of what stick-to-it-iveness and skill can do! \n \n Friends, I bring you an interview with writer Michelle O'Neil: \n \n \n \n 1) Why\ndid you decide to write your story as memoir? \n \n \n \n I played with the idea of fictionalizing it, but no\nmatter how I tried, it just didn't  feel \nright. One of the themes running through Daughter of the Drunk at the Bar was\nthis fear of being found out, and trying to hide. Having to pretend what was\nhappening in our home wasn't really happening. Shame. I think writing and\npublishing my story as fiction felt like more hiding. Hiding is no longer\ntolerable to me.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 2) How did you know what the framework would be? \n \n \n \n Initially, I wrote a really long, everything but\nthe kitchen sink, get it all out version, (you now Carrie, you read it\u2026poor\nthing) and then spent a very long time whittling away at it. As I was writing,\nI would remember songs, TV shows, fashion trends and memories came flooding\nback along with the scenes. I had tons of material.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n \n \n 3) How did you decide which episodes to include, and\nwhich ones to exclude? \n \n \n \n Once I figured out what my point really was, it was\neasy. My  point,  was to cultivate\nempathy for kids growing up in dysfunctional homes. To humanize them. Not to\nfeel sorry for them, per se, because there is a tenacity there, but to open up\nwhat might be going on for them, their rich inner worlds, so they might not be\nwritten off by teachers and other adults in their communities. Small actions on\nthe part of healthy adults had a profound impact on the trajectory of my life.\nI wanted people to know it doesn't take much to profoundly help a kid from a\ntroubled home. Sometimes just inviting them over for a meal can teach them\nskills which will serve them well.  \n \n \n \n So once I was clear on that, it was easy to figure\nout what to keep. Not necessarily easy to cut, because you get attached to your\nscenes but you've got to do it!  \n \n \n \n \n \n 4) How is your family reacting to the publication?  \n \n \n \n For a very long time in our family, I believe I was\nseen as \"overdramatic\" for taking a hard stance against my father. He\nwas not invited to my wedding, we were estranged, etc. Reading my book has\nhelped others in my family better understand the reasons for my decisions\naround him. My sister was often out of the house and did not experience as much\nof our father's dysfunction as I did. She was off living an adult life while I\nwas still in the thick of it. And there was a lot she had just blocked out. My\nbrother, being a boy, had a completely different experience. Both are dealing\nwith our father in their own way right now, but I feel loved and supported by\nthem.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n My mother has always been very supportive of my\nwriting and doing whatever it is I need to facilitate my own healing. She is\nnot sure she's ever going to read  Daughter\nof the Drunk at the Bar , and I support her decision not to, if that's\nwhat she chooses. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n My young brothers are from a different time period,\na different world! I'm not sure the story even interests them that much and as\nof yet, I don't think they've read it.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n 5) When will you have your kids read it, if ever? \n \n \n \n For a long time, I didn't even let my husband read\nmy manuscript. I had this fear it would be too painful for my loved ones to\nbear. The thought of my children one day reading it paralyzed me and made me\nunsure about \u00a0going forward with\nit. Children of dysfunction often feel they are \"too much\" or a\nburden.  \n \n \n \n Something shifted when I talked with a therapist\nabout it. She assured me my husband was a grown man, and he could take it, and\nsharing my story was important for our relationship. She was right.  \n \n \n \n I feel certain my children will one day read it, (we've\nagreed to revisit the issue when each is at least fifteen) and I'm confident\nthey will not be devastated by it, but proud of their mom, for breaking the\ncycle so they might lead happy healthy lives.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n 6) What has surprised you from the whole process? \n \n \n \n With technology today, it is much easier than I\nthought it would be to independently publish. Gone are the days of having to\norder a thousand hard copies to sit in your garage and mock you. With print on\ndemand there is very little upfront cost. Of course if you don't want your book\nto suck you should invest in good editors.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7) What would be your advice to someone just\nstarting to write memoir? \n \n \n \n Have a writing practice. Make time every day to\nwrite (or almost every day). Write  everything .\nEspecially that scene you'd rather not. Eat good food and drink pure water, and\nsleep. And step away from the computer and exercise. If you are just starting,\njust write. Don't worry if it is good. Don't share it with many people while\nit's new and tender. Go to writing workshops and find friends like  Carrie Wilson Link ,  Jenny Rough  and  Courtney Sheinmel  to have\nin your corner. Seriously.  \n \n \n \n 8) What do you know now, that you wished you'd\nknown then? \n \n \n \n I know now, that my writing, whether brilliant or\nsucky, does not determine my value as a person. If I'd really known that in the\nbeginning, I'd have taken myself less seriously and had a lot more fun. While I\nam always learning and striving to be a better writer, life is supposed to be\nfun. \n \n \n \n Thanks so much, Carrie!  \n \n \n \n Love. \n \n \n \n Daughter of the Drunk at the Bar is available in\npaperback on  Amazon  or in\nebook form on  Smashwords .\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_cmIrMEMzAw/TiNn1i7AE4I/AAAAAAAAAKk/wckiNnfLhtE/s1600/BookCoverImage.jpg", "http://www.daughterofthedrunkatthebar.blogspot.com/", "http://blog.jennyrough.com/", "http://www.courtneysheinmel.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Daughter-Drunk-Bar-Regular-Barstool/dp/0615509010/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1313548527&sr=8-1", "http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/73216"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/08/interview-with-michelle-oneil.html", "title": "\nAn Interview with Michelle O'Neil\n"},

Got to talk to some of the people I didn't the night before, and go a little deeper with those that I had. Really nice. \n \nThere were unexpected connections, small world stories, then just before I was leaving (after being there six hours), someone came up to me and said, \"Oh, you're leaving, darn, I really wanted to talk to you.\" So, of course I stayed another half hour and was glad I did. He said, \"I just wanted to tell you how much I liked your dad. I had him as a business law teacher, and now I'm a lawyer practicing business law.\" \n \nOn the way down to Eugene I stopped and saw really old family friends, spent a couple hours with my \"twin\" (born on the same day), her older sister and elderly parents. They knew my parents before they were married - knew my dad before he was even dating my mom. Both my twin and I have dad's with the same name, born four days apart. More than a coincidence, don't you think? \n \nThese two experiences book ending my weekend were nice extras. Wasn't expecting to go to my reunion and get stories about my dad that made me smile, made me soften, made me know him and appreciate him in a way I don't always. \n \nThen, right before my two buddies and I parted for the weekend, one of them told us about her time with an intuitive healer. The woman asked if she'd been using a belt sander. As a matter of fact, yes, she had. The healer said, \"Did you sand with ease?\" As a matter of fact, no, she had not. \"Do everything with ease. No matter what you're doing, cooking, sanding, laundry, talking, resting, washing dishes, driving, do it all with ease. Say to yourself, 'I am cooking with ease.' Add 'At ease' to the end of everything. \n \nLike that better than \"mindfulness\" or \"with presence.\" So, I said goodbye to my friends with ease. I drove home (in lots of traffic) with ease. I greeted my family, took Rojo out for frozen yogurt, and didn't unpack until today. With ease. \n \nAll day today I've found myself narrating what I'm doing. \"I'm going to Trader Joe's with ease.\" \"I'm parking with ease.\" \"I'm putting things away with ease,\" etc. \n \nAnd so I offer those helpful words to you, with ease. \n \nlove.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://backtoformfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/reunionlogo1.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/08/with-ease.html", "title": "\nWith Ease\n"},

Last night a bunch of us (30?) gathered at a bar that we had virtually to ourselves, outdoor seating, and enjoyed a lovely summer evening getting caught up on each other. \n \nIn just a few minutes my two high school buddies and I are meeting to do it all again tonight - this time at a restaurant, with appetizers, dinner, the whole 9-yards. \n \nSomething so neat (and slightly weird) about being in a group where everyone is exactly the same age. Only time that happens anymore, and that is only every ten years. School is like that, isn't it? We put kids into homogenous groupings according to age, and then we break it further down into abilities, interest, college bound-ness, and the like. I was in education for years, I get it. But life is kind of like that, too, much as we may spend large amounts of time with a wide-variety of people, we tend to group ourselves according to what we have in common - our shared interests, skills and lives. \n \nThe great thing about a 30th reunion, is that everyone is so over themselves. We were all commenting on how much more fun it was than the 10-year, where we all had our heads up our you-know-where, thinking we were it on a stick with all our 28-year-old know-everything-ness. \n \nTwenty years later we've all been humbled. We now know how little we know about most things, and what we do know, we know. And don't need a committee to agree. We are comfortable with our knowing and unknowing in a way that only a few hard knocks can provide. Nobody gets to 48 unscathed. Some might present as though they did, but if you talk to them for more than five minutes, you quickly learn that is simply not the case. \n \nSTM's advice to me before I packed up the CR-V and drove the two-hours south, was simply this: \"Everyone wants everyone else to be happy and well. That's all we want for each other at this point.

Long story short, we went to a dentist and two oral surgeons before deciding to move forward. She will have major drugs and the whole thing will be over in less than an hour.

Nancy is the one with the swing in her backyard, and the husband that brings me beer.

Everyone needs at least one Terry in their life - the Truth Teller. One who can show you your dark side while you belly laugh the entire time. She dared to utter all the ugly things running through my mind about all kinds of things. One by one she gave voice to them and I could hear how utterly ridiculous they sounded, while also hearing the true wounds that created the less than optimal reactions in the first place. I gave her an inch and she took a mile, in the best way possible. I complained that Kathleen had rightfully been offered the job of her dreams, and Terry said wonderful things like, \"How DARE she?\" \"You wouldn't have done that to  her !\" and my favorite, \"Nobody would even hire  you !\" All things at some level I believed to be true, but once brought into the light, saw to be only tiny truths, with much larger (healthier) truths underneath them. \n \n\"Nobody's telling me to get a job. I don't even  want \u00a0a job, but I don't want to be unemployable!\" I complained. \"I cannot get settled with that. Why can't I just complete the processing of that, and move ON?\" knowing instantly what the real answer to that is. I have a job. I have a 24/7 job, fifteen years in the exact same job, as a matter of fact, with no raise, very little change in responsibilities, no end in sight. No hope of retirement. \n \nHowever, there are great benefits. I get to spend hours on my front porch each day rocking in a cute white double rocker, with the beverage of my choice.

The days go by slowly, yet somehow the years fly by. \n \nCould he have been any cuter? I remember holding him in my arms for the very first time  just \u00a0after he was born and thinking,  He's handsome.  And at fifteen he's a pure lady killer. Dimples to die for, nice teeth, twinkly blue eyes, sandy blond hair with natural blond highlights, gorgeous hands, tall, slender (alright, skiiiiiinnny). \n \nThe boy that couldn't, then wouldn't, converse, is Mr. Social now. He is my dad at his best, all over again. It's got to be pure DNA or some encounter in the In Between, because they never met, but Rojo has many of the same mannerisms as my dad did, and it makes me smile every time I see or hear them. \n \nNow Rojo rides his bike over to the neighborhood school just down the street from our house (you can actually see it from our house), all by himself. It started with me telling him to ride on down and I'd follow with Flicka. He would beat us by five minutes, and that would be all the time he'd need to find or make a friend. By the time I got there he had the full 411. \"Mom, I just met a boy named Garrett. He is five. He.... \" blah, blah, blah. \n \nNow I've got him riding his bike down there without me. He rides in circles around the black top and chats people up if they're there, or just sings and raises his arms in praise if they aren't. If he's still there after fifteen minutes I walk on down and check it out. Sometimes it's painful to watch, not that he's doing anything wrong or that anyone is being less than kind - the opposite. People are exceedingly kind and patient, and some seem to actually be enjoying themselves. I forget that in small doses he can be delightful. He is just so not 15 when I observe, and as long as I've been at this, that still sweeps me at the knees at unexpected times. \n \nWe told him for his birthday we'd get him a cell phone and teach him to text. \"No, I do not want a cell phone,\" he protested, as expected. That's why we started the soft sell months ago, warming him up to the idea. We want him to have a phone for safety reasons, and for my convenience when I pick him up from school in the fall, since it's not as cut and dried as it's been for the past nine years. We also want him to be able to ask for help from his tribe, should the need arise. \n \nGot the phone a few days ago - walked into Verizon and explained the situation. Got the perfect sales person that didn't try to sell me a bunch of stuff I didn't need, but did get me sold on the need for insurance and an extra hard carrying case to withstand dropping. The phone has pretty big keys and \"flips,\" which was all that Rojo insisted upon. \"Mom, make sure my phone flips. I want a flip phone. Make sure it does not slide, like yours, make sure you turn it this way (horizontally) and it just boom, flips right up.\" Got him just the perfect one - way nicer than the cheap-o one I have, but what are you going to do? \n \nKnew he'd be obsessed about getting the phone all day if we didn't give it to him 2 seconds after he woke up, so that's just what we did. Doesn't everyone have their family birthday parties at 6:15 AM? Woohoo had to be up any way to go to work, so it was perfect. By 6:30 I'd received four texts from him. By 8:15 I'd received over 20. He is an awesome texter. Remembers to say, \"please\" and \"thank you.\" Remembers to say, \"goodbye.\" Remembers to say, \"I love you.\" I do realize that 2 hours do not a trend make, but I'm very encouraged. \n \nI had pre-programmed all his tribe into the phone before he opened it, and before wrapping it I'd sent everyone a text letting them know what his number is and warning them they'd be hearing from him on Thursday. He did not disappoint. \n \nThen the nicest thing evolved organically this morning, his three favorite tribe members: Kathleen, Nancy and her husband, Tom, all let me know they'd like to come by after he gets done at work. As it turns out they are all free at the same time and so we are all going to get frozen yogurt and celebrate our favorite boy. \n \nIt's cliche to say it takes a village to raise a child, but that doesn't make it any less true. \n \nHere's to Rojo's village, which happens to be mine. \n \nHere's to texting. \n \nHere's to Rojo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6FGBXYeQDtc/Th8jAB3VreI/AAAAAAAAAyY/Om-on-ZWv60/s1600/sc00011b0b.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/07/fifteen.html", "title": "\nFIFTEEN\n"},

That post remains one of my most \"hit\" posts of all time, and not because it was eloquent. It is because the lives that this woman touched were many, and the post got forwarded, put on Facebook by various people, etc., and it sort of rippled - just like her vast love. \n \nI'm sad to say that this incredible woman died very early Wednesday morning.

To say they know each other well is an understatement. In fact, they played a \"How Well Do You Know Each Other?\" game, and it was a 3-way tie between 3 of the 4 teams (my team lost, but let's not dwell). They are more siblings than anything, and if you ask me, you just can't put a price on that. I do believe they'd go to the ends of the earth for each other, and some of them already are, and some will be called to, and all will respond. \n \nIt's always a mixed blessing to be with Rojo and his whole class. I am simultaneously bombarded by the fact that he is anything but typical (can you say, \"Sore thumb?\") and the fact that he is 100% accepted, put up with beyond belief, and embraced. \n \nEarlier in the day each kid drew a name of one of their classmates. They were then asked to write in their journals, how this classmate had been a gift to them, and to others. At the end of the day Rojo's Resource Room teacher, Liz, (who, thank GOD came at the last minute and who saved the day multiple times), led the group in what she called an agape meal: bread, grapes, grape juice and a toasting to each other's gifts. She explained that agape means love - but a certain kind of love, unconditional, the kind that God has for us and that we're called to have for one another. \n \nLiz demonstrated how the whole thing would work, she would pick someone to start, they'd read what they'd written about the person whose name they'd chosen, then the person who'd just been read about would read, and so on, until each kid had read, and each kid had been bathed in agape. But before she picked a kid to begin, she said beautiful things about both J. and Rojo, \"her\" two students. She talked about the fun things she and J. had done together this year, and all the other wonderful things about J., of which they are innumerable. To Rojo she said, \"Thank you for teaching me everything I needed to know about teaching special ed,\" Of course that got my tears flowing - especially since this is not her first rodeo. \n \nThen later both of Rojo's truest and bluest friends, the two that have been there through thick and thin since kindergarten, the two that have held doors and zipped zippers, flushed toilets and buckled belts, come over to play and brought their friends, and the two that most recently baptized him, they both spoke. One had actually drawn his name (no accidents) and one shared lovely things about the person he'd drawn, then felt compelled to also comment on Rojo. \n \nAgape. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n* Photo from http://www.agape-loves.com\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.agape-loves.com/albums/Hearts/1/LItsAgape_Hearts100.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/06/agape.html", "title": "\nAgape\n"},

We walked straight to the donut case and there were four beauties just waiting for us. We took all four. Two to eat in the store while we \"browsed,\" and two to eat after lunch. Rojo talked me into a Starbucks Frappucchino in an oversized bottle that will take me three days to consume, and we approached the register. The twinkly-eyed man behind the counter had clearly been talking to our M-F friend. \"I save for you next time. You come and they are gone, you tell me, and I save in the back. How many you want? Two? Four?

Had I put more thought into this, I would have arranged to go with any number (or all) of my Mary loving friends. Since I decided about 20 minutes before I left that that was the plan, I did it alone, and thus, the solitude. I'm glad the way it worked out, since solitude is something I need more than most, I think, and don't prioritize enough. I need to put \"Solitude\" on the calendar with barbed wire around the edges, and not piss the days away like I am prone to do. \n \n Here's the Mary candle I bought and left to burn for seven days.

Wouldn't trade my life for anyone's. Nobody's. Not the people with nicer homes. Not the people that take fabulous vacations. Not with the ones that drive nice cars (or anything younger than 1997, for that matter). Not with the ones who have only typical children. Not with the ones with more time, money, energy, youth, reserves of every kind. Simply nobody. \n \nGot the \"You don't work, what do you do all day?\" question recently by a well-meaning person. (BTW, I've decided that 90 - 99% of people are well-meaning. What do you think?) I was at a total loss on how to answer that question. It's not that I don't know what I do all day, but I felt it impossible to convey it to someone that is not married, does not have kids, let alone special needs kids, does not have a house to clean, etc., etc., etc. It is not that her life is not super busy - it is - it is just very, very different from mine, and so I simply said, \"I try to help a lot of people.\" \n \nThat answer satisfied her, and then I spent some time (because I don't work, I have all kinds of time to ponder life's big questions) thinking about whether or not it satisfied me. \n \nI know when I have caregiver fatigue when I get cranky, short-tempered and the incoming request to drive a forgotten _________ (camera, change of clothes, wallet...) out to someone, or pick up the last minute __________ (gift, prescription, gluten-free item), or any number of the thankless, not-that-important-but-important-anyway things I do on any given day, make me want to scream. \n \nI know that I've landed on the magic formula when these requests illicit a I-am-so-grateful-I-have-the-opportunity-to-help response in me.

{"date": "Monday, May 16, 2011", "body": "\n \n A lot of you know that the wheels have been turning for several years to build a new high school program for kids with learning differences. I am very excited, relieved and honored to tell you that this program will open in the fall, and Rojo will be in the inaugural class. Really, not enough can be made of this. The program is going to rock. The program is going to change the lives of the kids in it. The program is going to change the lives of the kids  not \u00a0in it. The program is going to change the community and the community is going to change the larger community, and so on and so on and so on. May sound grandiose, but I believe it to be true. I've seen what's happened to the community Rojo is currently in, and I think that's one of the many reasons he's \"here,\" to evolve thinking, simply by being himself. \n \n Rojo has taken it upon himself to be the greeter at school. It started last year, he'd stand next to the principal at the top of the stairs that everyone has to walk up to get to their classes, and he'd say good morning to them. The principal was kind enough to share her post, although I don't think there was much she could have done to shut it down, even if she'd wanted to. He was a man on a mission. \n This year Rojo has stepped it up. He simply  must \u00a0be the very first student at school. Despite the weather, he is there before even some of the teachers. He stands outside and greets each student/parent/teacher by name as they arrive. Sometimes middle names are included. Sometimes he asks, \"How is your _________ (mom, dad, wife, husband, sister, dog...)\" And sometimes there is an accompanying \"I love you.\" Although I believe he loves each of the people that arrive, he somehow has figured out which people find that comforting to hear, and which might find it kind of creepy. I guess in the scheme of things this is a much bigger knowing than say tying shoes, differentiating between left/right, push/pull, behind/in front of, etc, which all still allude him. \n \nRojo has a month left of school before his big, big, let me say it again, BIG transition to high school. As much as we've worked and planned to make his next four (or more) years of high school an extension of all that's working for him now, including many of the same people/community, it will nonetheless be epic. I know there will be bumps. I know there will be things we put into place that will need to be readjusted, subtracted, tweaked and abandoned. I know that he will in many ways be a guinea pig, and the program won't be all that it's capable of being until he's long gone. \n \nI also know that when he walks in the door each day he will be greeted by name, by at least one person and probably many. I know that he will be told he is loved by at least one person, and probably many. I know that with that foundation, anything else is a bonus, for isn't that what we're all looking for in the end? To be known, and to be loved. \n \n \nphoto from: www.words-chinese.com\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.words-chinese.com/images2/chinese_symbols_for_welcome_6661_2_15.png"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/05/greeter.html", "title": "\nThe Greeter\n"},

Kicking the sides of whatever is near him. \n \nI decided to take advantage of the bonus time and watch an episode of \"Glee\" on my computer, streamed instantly from Netflix. Have a love-hate relationship with \"Glee.\" Don't love all the special ed./short bus jokes. Don't love that so much that I've almost stopped watching the show entirely, but there's enough going for it that I stick with it.

Let's just say there  might \u00a0be mail from April 21st that I have yet to open. \n \nWent for a walk with Kathleen and Flicka early, then came home and just had all kinds of trouble settling into anything, flitted and floated ineffectively from one task to the other, all the while with a sense of unease.  Something is about to happen.\u00a0 \n \n \nPhone rang. Rojo's school. Rojo's school never calls me.  Uh oh, \u00a0I thought. The secretary said Rojo had cut himself with scissors, and they couldn't get the bleeding to stop. \"I'll be right up,\" I said, sending up a prayer of thanks that I was home (albeit unshowered) and able to get there so quickly, when there are days on end that that just never would have happened). \n \n\"I think he needs a stitch,\" the secretary said. \n \n\"I'll take him up to Zoom Care\" I said, thinking it was the kind of place you just dropped in on, sort of like an emergency room, without the emergency. Plus, they just built one really close to my house. And, because there are no accidents, one of the women from my support group just happened to be walking by the office and heard me say that. \n \n\"Oh, you can't just go up there, you have to make an appointment, but you can do that online. Do you have a Smart Phone?\" \n \n\"No,\" I answered, not bothering to explain that I am pleased I even have a phone that has a full keyboard for texting, because I didn't have that until this fall. \n \n\"Want to borrow mine?\" she asked, handing me her iPhone. \n \n\"No, I want you to do it,\" I said, truthfully, knowing nothing about iPhones and being way too rattled to learn in that instant. So, of course that's just what she did - got me all situated right then and right there. \n \nTurns out you need to cancel the appointment with at least an hour warning, or be charged $99. Although the bleeding hadn't stopped at 9:30, our 1:30 appointment seemed like a reasonable time to have this issue self-fix, so I made the appointment and then agreed to meet Jenn, Rojo and the secretary back at school right before lunch to see what was what. \n \nWe pulled back the Scooby Doo Band-aid and indeed, the blood had stopped. Cleaned up the wound and put on some Neosporin, put on a fresh Scooby Doo and away I went to cancel the appointment, \ngrateful for no accidents, self-fixing injuries, and angels, angels, everywhere.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.first-aid-product.com/images/0/0104458.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/05/no-accidents.html", "title": "\nNo Accidents\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, April 28, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI'm almost too high to write right now (plus I'm drinking my in-all-ways-bad mocha). Rojo was just Baptized and received his First Holy Communion. I wish all of you reading this blog could have been there, and thankfully, many, many of you were. \n \nRojo started his march towards receiving these Sacraments this winter, and enjoyed the process tremendously. Loved the other kids in his class. Loved the sponsors (fellow eighth grade students, many of them), loved the teachers, loved the teacher assistants, loved it up one side and down another. \"I will miss RCIA,\" he said. I think he'd like to go every other Thursday from 3:30 to 5:00 for the rest of his life (and don't think for a minute that my wheels aren't already turning how I can make that dream a reality in some way). \n \nOf course I worried. Worried that he would not put the host in his mouth for the First Communion (with the entire church looking on). Worried that he'd freak out at the cup. Worried that although we were assured by the priest (repeatedly) that he would only \"sprinkle\" him and not \"dunk\" him, that somehow he'd get too wet and/or worry about being too wet, and again, freak out. Worried that our non-Catholic family would be uncomfortable being in front of the whole church as Rojo received his First Communion, and knew it would break his heart if they weren't there, yet worried about their comfort level, too. Worried for months. Sent 1,000 e-mails. Got consoled 1,000 times. \"It'll all work out,\" was told over and over. \n \n\"I will take the host, but I will not drink the wine,\" Rojo told me repeatedly. \"I am fourteen. Fourteen-year-olds do not drink wine.\" How was I supposed to argue with  that ? Nonetheless, when it dawned on me he was the ONLY one receiving First Holy Communion today and all eyes would be on him, I wanted him to take the cup. Razzle Dazzle saved the day, \"Hey, Rojo, just fake it. Take the cup up to your mouth, but don't take a sip!\" Brilliant. Then I sent up a prayer that the person \"assigned\" to hold the cup would be our principal, who totally gets him (and \"it\"). \n \nAnd of course, all the worry was in vain. Not only did he NOT freak out in the least, he pretty much rocked it. Fair to say there wasn't a dry eye in the place when after we, his parents and his godparents and the priest anointed him with oil, he gave a big ear-to-ear grin and flashed us with the thumbs up sign. \n \nIt only went up from there. Father took Rojo's success very seriously and thought of details I could not have thought of. \"I will have Razzle Dazzle and Rosie join him in the font. I will have them help me baptize him. I will do 'In the name of the Father,' then they will do the Son and Holy Spirit.\" Rojo's truest and bluest (and that is saying something because every single member of his class would have been happy to take on that role and would have been super special, too), climbed in that font, and shared in the blessing. Shared in the sprinkling. Shared in the holiness. When it was over Father helped him up out of the font and he stood on the ledge, facing out at the congregation. The music leader began to sing and play his guitar and Rojo raised both his arms (high), moving them all over as if conducting. Pure joy was on his face. When the music ended Rojo shouted (yes, shouted), \"AMEN!\" There was laughter. There was applause. There were tears and I'm afraid some ugly crying, too, and that was just from ME. \n \nLater Razzle Dazzle said to me, \"That was the closest I've ever gotten to crying tears of joy.\" \n \nThen there were all the other things I should\u00a0have thought about and totally didn't. Not to worry. Kathleen thought of asking someone to come and take pictures. Two brilliant photographers came and captured the whole thing.\u00a0And of course, the principal came up to me right before the Mass and asked, \"Did you assign anyone special to be Eucharistic Ministers?\" \n \n\"I was hoping  you \u00a0would be,\" I said, then I told her about Plan Fake. She made the necessary arrangements and there she was. \"Amen,\" Rojo said, clear as a bell when he received the host from Father. Then he moved over to the principal and did a great fake, after which, also clear as a bell he said, \"Did I fake it?\" \n \nThe eighth grade moms took it upon themselves to plan a little reception afterwards in the classroom. I didn't lift a finger. I just showed up and got to bask in the glory. \n \nSTM, Razzle Dazzle, Rosie, Rojo, godparents and I processed out with Father, very emotional looking around the church at all the people that love my boy. Not just like him. Not just put up with him. Not just being nice. LOVE him. Kathleen turned to one mom after we were out and said, \"What did you think?\" \n \nShe answered, \"That that's what it's all about.\" \n \nAmen. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bghYERBCiAw/TP-1sF-q9RI/AAAAAAAABqI/eLs_4ud6ypc/s1600/baptism+water.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/04/sacramental-day.html", "title": "\nSacramental Day\n"},

{"date": "Monday, April 25, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nThich Nhat Hahn, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, had something to do with my becoming Catholic. \u00a0In his book,  Living Buddha, Living Christ  (which I highly recommend to every human on the planet), he spoke of the Three Jewels of Buddhism: the Buddha (awakened or enlightened one) \u00a0the Dharma (teachings) and the Sangha (community of practitioners). While talking about practicing mindful living he says, \"The best way to practice is with a Shanga: the collective energy of mindfulness deepens the practice. The presence of the Sangha is a protection and an empowerment, and this presence sustains us during the rest of the week as well.\" Regardless of any religious orientation of one form or another, to be most helpful, a person needs to have all three: an enlightened master, the teachings of that/those masters, and then a community in which to practice the teachings of the enlightened master. \n \nDrawn to both Buddhism and Catholicism for years, the fact of the matter remained, I had a built-in community for one, and not for the other. Not only did I have a built-in community, I already had one foot firmly planted in it for a dozen years, and so many of the men and women I've chosen to journey with in this lifetime are part of that community. They are the friends I want to grow old with. They were already my Sangha, my faith community, but I had not embraced what was right in front of me all the time. \n \nAs I progressed through the process and more and more people learned I'd (finally) decided to join, the welcoming, the celebrating and the love. was really overwhelming. Had any of these people (or priest) put the screws to us, we would have run in the other direction, but their patient, gentle, we-can-go-either-way-with-you approach worked for STM and me. \n \nIn the end (and in the beginning, as it is with endings and beginnings), it was what Mary was calling me to do. Someone pivotal introduced me to Mary several years ago, and She's been calling me towards her in this direction ever since. I don't believe she calls people to be Catholic, necessarily, but I totally believe she calls people toward the Light, and for me, She is present and alive in this church, and that totally works for me in a very big way. \n \nChose Mary for my confirmation name and as the priest (liberally) anointed me with chrism oil that was perfumed and out-of-this-world, he blessed me by that name. That was a moment that I will never forget. \u00a0Kathleen was my sponsor (she was so my sponsor long before I named her my sponsor, but that pretty much goes without saying). After being anointed and welcomed into the faith, we turned and hugged. Our new Mary necklaces made for each of us by another Mary-loving holy person, touching gently, neck to neck.

Know the problems, not sure how or if I want to fix them. Okay with not knowing. Okay with working on it through the ambivalence.

Of course we are doomed to fail, and of course the idea that we could even try it was easier when we were together and had already had a glass (or three) of wine. However, we vowed to be more mindful of our worrying, and to look at it as it came up (and up and up and up) and say, \"No, at this moment I am going to choose not to worry,\" then we'd offer a prayer of thanks that we knew all would be well, all would, in fact, be \"perfect.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n* Photo from www.bars-and-bartending.com\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bars-and-bartending.com/images/glass-red-wine-clinking.jpg", "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/choke", "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/strangle", "http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=6190519338493655360&postID=3202029365118024903", "http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=6190519338493655360&postID=3202029365118024903", "http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=6190519338493655360&postID=3202029365118024903", "http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=6190519338493655360&postID=3202029365118024903", "http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=6190519338493655360&postID=3202029365118024903", "http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=6190519338493655360&postID=3202029365118024903", "http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=6190519338493655360&postID=3202029365118024903", "http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=6190519338493655360&postID=3202029365118024903", "http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=6190519338493655360&postID=3202029365118024903", "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/torment", "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/strangle", "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/choke", "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/struggle", "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fret", "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/worry#"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/03/worry.html", "title": "\nWorry\n"},

{"date": "Monday, February 28, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nI'm just anxious. There are reasons for the anxiety that I'm quite clear about and make perfect sense (you don't need a list), and reasons that are nothing short of ridiculous, but are nonetheless causing me great angst. I spent a full night tossing and turning over what Rojo will wear to high school IN SEPTEMBER, because he currently wears a uniform with elastic waist thingies that allow him to just pull them up and never have to button or unbutton, or bother with a belt. When Rojo has free dress he wears elastic waisted sweat pants. In high school I want him to wear jeans, just like the other boys, and I've yet to see a pair of elastic waisted jeans in the men's department, actually, I have, but not in the stores/men's departments from which I intend to make a purchase. Got myself all in a stew about it before STM noticed I was a wreck and asked me what my problem was. \n \n\"What will Rojo wear to high school?\" I blurted out. \n \n\"You mean, in SEPTEMBER?\" he asked, incredulously. \"Don't you have things you need to worry about that are going to happen today or tomorrow? Why are you on September??\" \n \nWell, there is no short answer to that question. I have been \"on\" September 2011 for about four years, and there is no question that is a major underlying cause of my anxiety. When STM realized that yes, indeed, the sheer panic was coming from something that was over six months away, he quickly came to a reasonable solution. \"We'll just buy him jeans that are long enough, and have a tailor take them in, or put in elastic somehow so he can still just pull them up without unbuttoning them or wearing a belt.\" \n \nHadn't thought of that. \n \nAnd therein lies my problem. I have 1001 worries that go head-to-head with the elastic waist crisis, but zero solutions. I cannot get my brain to unhook from the panic, long enough to explore solutions. \n \nOften when I get myself all worked up about nothing, I think of all the people in my community dealing with serious, life and death type issues. I couldn't throw a stone from my front porch without it hitting someone with MUCH bigger problems than I am dealing with. And while that really helps me on one level, it only adds to the anxiety on another, then I have just one more thing to feel anxious about, my lack of appreciation, realization and gratitude of my relatively easy life. \n \nThree years ago I withdrew from my anti-anxiety meds. I hesitated at the time chronicling that whole thing, but I'm glad that I did. Ever since, I've had people come up to me and tell me about their own anxiety, their own medications, and their own withdrawal stories. The withdrawal alone was enough to make me swear I'd never again consider going back on any SSRI. I am still not considering an SSRI, but the tools that have served me well, for the most part, these past three years, are not quite enough now. I need more tools. The tools I add may include going back to yoga, may include more time on the meditation cushion with mindful breathing, may include a visit to the naturopath for something to help, may include starting Beer O'Clock a little earlier each day, I'm not sure just yet. Right now all that I know is that I'm anxious, and perhaps touching that with gentle awareness is all that I'm called to do at this time. \n \n \n* Photo from http://www.erikbohlin.net\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.erikbohlin.net/cycle_of_anxiety_edited.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/02/anxious.html", "title": "\nAnxious\n"},

Here's what I mean: what I am good at, I am  very \u00a0good at, and recognizing my strengths and not only acknowledging them but being good with them, was harder than recognizing and being good with my weaknesses. Why is it that we, as humans, find it easier to list and accept our weaknesses, than to list and accept our strengths, not only accept, but really step into?

{"date": "Thursday, February 17, 2011", "body": "\n \nI was at a class last night on moral decision making - fascinating! We broke into small groups and were to discuss how is it we make our decisions? Consensus? Do we just do whatever is going to make the other person(s) happy? Do we do what others tell us to do? What our parents would do? What our parents would NOT do? What our religion tells us is right or wrong? WHAT goes into our decisions and how mindful are we of all that goes into them, if anything? One of the things we discussed was the sheer knee jerk reaction that drives many of our decisions. \n \nOne thing the women in our group agreed on (and Kathleen and I  were \u00a0\"the\" women in the group, so this is no surprise), is that we no longer make decisions the way we once did, which was primarily to please. We now (for the most part) try to first buy ourselves some time before making any big decision so we can really sit with it and fully process, and we check in with our bodies to see what they have to say about the matter, as we all know, the body never lies. \n \nOne man in the group said he just makes his decisions. He also has a history of trying to please and do what a good son/husband/employee/etc. would do, but is working now to be more mindful in all regards, especially more mindful of what  he  wants and doesn't want. Another man in the group said he gives no consideration whatsoever to what others want or think or believe or expect of him. \n \nThe conversation veered into the influence our spouse has over our decisions. One man joked, \"When I got married the priest said the key to marriage boiled down to two words, 'Yes, dear.'\" I object to this for a thousand reasons, but the biggest is that I want no part of a marriage that is \"successful\" because one person is dominated by the other. I also resent that this advice is historically given to men, and that assumes all women are shrews and that the only way to live with a shrew is just to agree with her. I know plenty of marriages where the one saying, \"Yes, dear,\" is the wife, and still, not my idea of a great marriage. \n \nNow, by the same token, there are a million times in a marriage where the kindest, wisest and sanest response to a partner may very well be, \"Yes, dear,\" but that must come out of wisdom, and not out of fear or avoidance, the no answer answer must be a decision, not a default. \n \nLater STM and I were talking about the whole \"Yes, dear,\" thing and he said, \"I don't think those two words are the secret to marriage. I think the secret to marriage is three words, 'Thank you for __________'\" \n \nTo which I said, \"Yes, dear!\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7ITl62fwR1Y/SQEapZFKYpI/AAAAAAAAAFs/qPqN9Zzjj54/s400/good_wife.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/02/yes-dear.html", "title": "\nYes, Dear\n"},

We've gone as often as monthly and as little as quarterly, for thirteen years.\u00a0He's really good about celebrating our progress (which is gigantic) and pointing out our next goal or two. We are supposed to start getting Rojo as independent as possible, starting with going into a grocery store together, sending him off on his own to get milk, coming back to the cart and then going back for something else, etc. There is a little store in our neighborhood just a few short blocks away. The goal is that someday I will be able to give him $10, send him with a short list, and have him come back with everything on it (with as much help as he needs once in the store). This is a long way from happening, but we are baby stepping it now. At this point he is not willing to separate from me in the grocery store, but I can get him to find something in the aisle while I'm in the same aisle looking for something else. Like I said, baby steps. \n \nThe other thing we are supposed to do is get Rojo to express his opinion. The doctor explained to us something so obvious, yet I'd never thought of it in these terms: opinions use both the left and right sides of the brain. They take fact (left) and cross over for feelings (right), and make the two hemispheres work together. Right now when you ask Rojo what he thinks about something, he's likely to say, \"Good.\" It's very hard for him to expand - to offer an opinion on anything. It's not hard to get my daughter to offer an opinion on literally, EVERYTHING, so it's comforting to know it's a wiring thing and not a bad parenting thing that is giving him such trouble. \n \nThis new task has helped to reshape my views on my own opinions and those of others. When I totally disagree with others' opinion I am a little better at saying to myself, \"That is just their feelings mixed with some fact,\" instead of dismissing them as just plain wrong. The tricky part is when I agree with their opinions to realize that then, too, it is simply their feelings mixed with fact. It is not pure fact. It is not pure feelings. It is not pure, at all. It's an opinion. Nothing more, nothing less, but very worth considering, always. \n \n \n* Photo from http://www.ucmas.ca\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ucmas.ca/pictures/content/Left_Vs_Right_Brain.gif"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/01/opinion.html", "title": "\nOpinion\n"},

No. We just moved the party inside. Tom put away the patio table and chairs and instead of bringing Flicka and hanging in the backyard, we took over their family room.

However, surrender is MUCH harder than praise, don't you think? Surrender? C'mon, that's HARD! \n \nI think we all think - at least I know I do - that if we surrender, our lives will get worse, not better.

Don't we think that? \n \nI know that growing up I was repeatedly told to surrender my life to Jesus. No way was I doing that. I knew the minute I let him take over he'd \"make\" me a nun, and I wanted no part of being a nun.

Found the towering stack of photo albums, but nine out of ten of them were of Woohoo. Simply cannot find any photo albums of Rojo from grades 1-5. Missing. \n \nLooked through the baby and toddler albums of him just briefly, randomly turning to pages and giving them a cursory glance. That's was all I could do. To really go back and really look and really be back in those years is simply not something I'm up for. \n \nHard to believe that looking at that darling boy in the picture above, doesn't fill me with joy, right? I know. Just look at him. Could he be any cuter? And any healthier looking? And look at him eating a variety of food and textures. But pictures can lie. That same darling, healthy, happy boy I just happened to get a photo of, that boy didn't live at our house very much. The boy that lived with us then was always in my arms, on my hip, being jiggled, being stuck with a pacifier, and eventually being brushed with surgical sponges and having his joints compressed every two hours to turn on his sensory system and help him to regulate. \n \nI don't have a lot of those pictures. Too busy to go get a camera and take a shot of any of that. \n \nThought I'd done okay with finding enough pictures for what I needed, thought I'd done okay skimming the surface of the pain without diving into the deep end, thought I'd done okay reflecting on those years and realizing that we are not there anymore, that we have a very happy, joyful, delightful, what-he-is boy living with us right now. \n \nBut apparently my body had another idea. As the day wore on I got sicker and sicker. Stomach cramps that felt like labor and hit with a force every 15 minutes for 24 hours. Ended up going into the doctor afraid of what she might find. She didn't have a firm answer, ran some tests and we will await the results. Feeling better now, but there is a lingering sense of non-wellness. \n \nI still don't know what happened to the missing photo albums, and part of me mourns their loss, if they're truly gone, and part of me is relieved never to have to look at them again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Y7N53Ct_kts/TSXo52gnCFI/AAAAAAAAAxA/EGPT7wMCjyc/s1600/sc0002f613.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2011/01/ptsd.html", "title": "\nPTSD\n"},

The older woman said, \"Let's just get this over with as soon as possible.\" Then the older woman began to drink like a fish. Somehow my awareness kicked in and I realized this older woman was my hairdresser's mother, and  together \u00a0they were going to do my hair! I called a meeting, sat them both down at a table in the back room, and announced that this simply was not going to work for me. I did not want anyone DRUNK doing my hair, for starters, and did not care for \u00a0the let's-just-get-this-over-with attitude one tiny bit. So. I'm learning to be assertive, if only in my dreams. It's a good start, right? \n \nNext dream I was trying to find some privacy to get dressed, but there were people everywhere. Finally found a spot in the woods (!) and someone found me there, too! I told them that I thought I had some ANIMALS I needed to give birth to, and would they be a sport and UNZIP the back of my body (!) and pull them out, please? Only if it was not too much of a bother. They obliged, and out came some damn thing that I can't even remember. A bird? A dog? Not sure. Then I said, \"I actually think there is more in there, would you please check, as long as you are there anyway?\" They pulled out TWO more animals of some sort and then zipped me back up and away I went. \n \nI DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GIVE BIRTH, people! OMHOG! \n \nThen later, when I'd finished my very important and totally unmemorable business, I went by to check on the animals I'd just sort of given birth to. They were all nestled in some sort of outdoor cozy shelter with their animal-appropriate mothers, sleeping, eating, resting and in all ways doing great. \n \nSo, all's well that ends well, but still. Let's review the facts: I had only a vague sense that I was pregnant and even then, only as an afterthought I took care of the whole birth thing. Then, after a completely detached experience of getting them out of my body, I wanted nothing to do with the actual raising of my offspring. Too busy. \n \nI know this dream is not about my parenting. I am going to go ahead and give myself an A on that front. What this dream is about is my DREAMS. A total afterthought. Detached.

You gotta love a store that sells love seats in a box and whose instructions have zero words. We spent much of the long weekend re-arranging and building furniture, and getting decorated for Christmas. Our dining room is now a cute family room off the kitchen. We had it this way years ago and then got conventional and made it back into a dining room. Thing is, we don't dine. \n \nNow the room you walk into when you enter the house is the dining room. Weird, you say? Yes. We are weird. For years I've fought the floor plan of this house and the non-conformity of my husband. Now, slowly, I'm learning to surrender. I'm lucky to have a house with so much flexibility, I tell myself. And it's true. It's the  If You Give a Mouse a Cookie \u00a0syndrome, as my friend, Susan would say. You know the children's book where the mouse asks for a cookie, then needs a glass of milk, and, and, and and pretty soon nothing is as it once was just because the mouse wanted a little cookie. Same thing. Moved the denim furniture into the new \"family room,\" moved the dining room table into the old entry space, needed something for the spot in the living room from whence we stole the denim stuff. You get it. \n \nAnyway. \n \nWoohoo was out with friends and STM and I were spending a thrilling Saturday night putting together our new IKEA stuff and watching the Beavers get beat by Stanford. Rojo was pulling up college fight songs on YouTube and making really loud, annoying and repetitive guttural sounds in time with the bands, something he'd pretty much been doing for four days straight, but who's counting? \n \nPhone rang. STM's mom. Her elderly and in very poor health sister had just passed away. We knew at Thanksgiving that she had gone into a Hospice and it was only a matter of days. Still. A huge loss for my MIL, as they were very close. They spoke every single Saturday morning on the phone, even though over 2,000 miles had separated them for years. Just that morning, in fact, my MIL had called and one of her niece's had put the phone up to her failing mother's ears and let my MIL talk to her. Makes me cry just thinking about it. \n \nSTM got off the phone and told Rojo and me, \"Well, she died.\" \n \n\"I don't feel sorry for her,\" I said, \"she's got to be in such a much better place, but I feel sorry for your mom and all the other people that loved her.\" \n \n\"Are you going to die?\" Rojo asked me. \n \n\"Someday,\" I said, \"when I'm very old.\" \n \n\"What about me, am I going to die?\" he asked. \n \n\"Yes, when you are very old.\" \n \n\"But don't die without me, okay?\" he said. \"Let's die at the same time.\" \n \nI instantly thought of a disturbing conversation I'd had with a woman that is the mother to a grown son with extreme disabilities. When she grows too old to take care of him, she plans to put them both in her cry and drive into the river. She can't bear the thought of him alone in the world without her. \n \nI get it. \n \n\"So, do you promise you won't die without me?\" Rojo persisted. \n \nObviously not being something I could promise, I tried diversion. \"What about Daddy?\" \n \n\"Daddy, too,\" he said, \"and Flicka. We'll all die together. It'll be a PARTY!\" he said, hands clapping, one leg kicking out in celebration, a huge smile across his dimpled cheeks. \n \n* Photo from www.rosesuk.com\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rosesuk.com/gfx/media/home/rroses/rest_in_peace.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2010/11/party-on.html", "title": "\nParty On\n"},

I've gotta say, I have the best friends in the whole world. I have friends that walk beside me every day, both literally and figuratively. I have friends that go to Costco and buy Rojo's favorite snacks and my favorite beer (Mirror Pond) to have on hand for when we invite ourselves over for Beer O'Clock pretty much every day. I have friends that have volunteered to work with Rojo in his class, and continue to do so year after year after year after year. I have friends that call and remind me who I am, what's important to me, where I'm headed and show me how to get there. I have friends who place the perfect dog into my life at the perfect time.

Everything is a shade of grey with little or nothing being pure black or pure white. \n \nWhen I started this blog almost five years ago, that was my first post,\u00a0 Shades of Grey . And although it's really true that the more I know the less I know. I know more, too. I know that love is all there is. \n \nThere are times I don't have a blog post to write because all I'm thinking is stuff I've already shared and shared and shared. Feels at times there isn't a single stone left to turn. Life with Rojo is repetitive and cyclical, too. Every year at Christmas time he sings, \"Deck the Halls with Boughs of Jolly,\" and you already know that. Every year at Easter he asks the Easter Bunny, Devohn, to come to our house and hide eggs, and you already know that. Every year on his birthday we force him to reach some new milestone, and you already know that. You also know that I've been working and worrying and trusting and praying, begging and pleading and in all ways obsessed with where he will go to high school next year. \n \nAs I've been working on my \"new\" manuscript these last few months, I've pulled in lots of blog posts and even parts of my first manuscript. A friend and fellow writer told me that's what I would do, \"You'll cannibalize what you've already written. Stuff that you didn't know what to do with before, or that didn't work then, will find it's way into your new work. There is no new. There is only old with a different perspective - time.\" \n \nWhile reading through a bunch of stuff I've written the last several years, both here and \"off line,\" I see just how much I've changed. Just how much Rojo has changed. Just how much my marriage has changed. \n \nAnd it's really true what they say: the more things change, the more they stay the same. \n \n* Photo from www.davefleet.com\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://davefleet.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/greyscale-259x300.jpg", "http://fully-caffeinated.blogspot.com/search?q=shades+of+grey"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2010/12/black-white-and-grey.html", "title": "\nBlack, White, and Grey\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, November 16, 2010", "body": "\n \nEver since we moved the clocks back, I am so aware of how many waking hours of the day are dark. It's dark when I get up. It's dark before dinner. It's dark even when it's light some days, lights are necessary during the day, headlights on the car, candles, anything to bring light to the darkness. \n \nWe are going through a time around here where there are more questions than answers, where there is a nothing-more-we-can-do feeling conflicting with a strong there-must-be-more-that-we-can-do sense. In essence, we are in a period of waiting and darkness. The path is not illuminated, yet we know it is there. \n \nThis morning I was in my converted closet/prayer room and Flicka pushed through the door and joined me. \u00a0Rojo was right behind her. It was early in the morning and I had several candles going in there. Rojo, super hyper and wound up, quickly blew out all the candles, jumped around, made a mess, then left, leaving Flicka behind. Flicka curled up in a ball close to me, but I couldn't see her at all in the pitch dark. Not even her eyes shone. Still, I knew she was there, I could sense her, even though no part of her was actually touching any part of me. There was simply a there-ness to her. \n \nBefore STM and Woohoo left for school and work, we sat down for our family prayer time. Again we were in the dark except for candles, and a little growing daylight coming through the windows. Rojo pulled his angel card-of-the-day and for the third day in a row, he pulled Expectancy. \n \nAs I struggle to believe in what I cannot see but can only feel, he does not struggle whatsoever. He has a positive expectancy. He does not need to rely on faith because there is no question in his mind that things will work out any way but good. Scratch that, he believes they will work exactly the way they are intended to, according to some divine plan that is none of his business and not his problem. \n \nIn the dark he is not in darkness. He's expectant. \n \nLord, \nOpen our eyes to see beauty, \nOpen our ears to hear truth, \nOpen our minds to seek wisdom, \nOpen our mouths to speak kindness, \nAnd open our hearts to love. \n \nAmen.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.workingaussiesource.com/images/diary%20images/candle.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2010/11/darkness.html", "title": "\nDarkness\n"},

Hmmm... guess she doesn't count music videos and pictures of Christmas cards true \"posts.\" Hoping no one would notice. See, here's the thing. I love to write. I can't not write. I write in my head all day every day and it's enough to make me, and everyone around me, crazy. Nonetheless (best word ever - feel free to steal it), it's nearly impossible for me to write when kids and the husband are home, and they are home, have been home, and will continue to be home for several more days. \n \nStill. STM is watching his 1,000th (I swear) episode of \"Prison Break\" on his laptop, Rojo is watching a Scooby Doo movie, and Woohoo is at a friend's. Even Flicka Link (x3) is contented and for the next 60 minutes it is unlikely I will be disrupted. By them, anyway. The laundry threatens to disrupt me, as does the dog hair that is flying around like nobody's business, as it's been six days since I vacuumed last and that's about five days too many when you have a profuse shedder, however cute she may be. E-mail threatens to disrupt me. The leftover Christmas candy/cookies/treats threaten to disrupt me. Even Ingrid Michaelson playing in my headphones threatens to disrupt me as there is a good chance I may need to go to iTunes and make \"Everybody\" repeat a few times, then I'll get tired of it and need to go in and put it back on that play the next song thing. \n \nSee the problem? See why I need SABBATH? Sorry. A word like Sabbath should probably not be yelled! Oops! So many things zinging through my brain all at the same time, and with no priority listing. The drivel is just as loud and clamoring as the biggies. Does anyone else have this problem, or just me? \n \nPlus, I have all the Christmas stories to catch you up on and don't even know where to begin there. I guess I'll start with telling you how this year Rojo asked each person for something different for Christmas. He didn't even tell us what he had asked for (or even that he had). My mom just said one day, \"Did you know Rojo wants 'Christmas' socks for Christmas? Do you have any idea what he means by 'Christmas' socks?\" With a little digging I learned he wanted slipper socks like she wears. Yes, women's socks. Yes, she bought them. Yes, he's wearing them right this minute, actually. \n \nHe told Woohoo he wanted pajamas with Santa on them and she and I searched the city looking for them until going to Old Navy, seeing their one and only pair on the mannequin, and thereby beseeching the poor sales girl to strip the mannequin on the spot and selling us the pair, which, again, were women's and again, yes, he is all too happy to wear. They really couldn't be cuter. Santa has a jaunty magenta hat on each of his repeating pattern heads and there's a lovely shade of green going on there, too. \n \nHe told STM that he wanted a BIG tiger from Santa, but he told me he wanted a SMALL tiger from Santa. Darned if that Santa didn't find matching big and small tigers. Rojo was thrilled but not surprised. Why should he be? It's what he asked for! Why am I always so surprised when I get what I ask for? Why is he  never ? \n \nRojo told my in-laws he wanted those chocolates wrapped in gold like coins. Got 'em. Told my sister-in-law he wanted a Boston Terrier T-shirt. Got it. He didn't really get a whole lot else from the family, but he did get a BCS T-shirt with the Fightin' Oregon Duck on it from Kathleen, and he's proceeded to wear it three of the six days since he opened it. You know that Oregon is in THE championship, right? You know they're playing Auburn, right? You know that Rojo loves Auburn, right? You know that I've HIDDEN his Auburn T-shirt from him so he doesn't start a riot in the streets around here, right? You know I'm not kidding, right? Did you also know that Rojo has determined we need a BCS party and has created a guest list and fortunately his favorite people are my favorite people, and they are coming? No, you didn't know any of this because I've been too busy running around like a chicken with my head cut off and not stopping to have a big part of my Sabbath, which is WRITING. \n \nAnyhoo. Sorry, Courtney, that's just a smidgen of the madness running through my head at any given moment.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://images.footballfanatics.com/FFImage/thumb.aspx?i=/productImages/_592000%2Fff_592564_xl.jpg&w=400", "http://courtneywrites.livejournal.com/"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2010/12/easily-disrupted.html", "title": "\nEasily Disrupted\n"},

Most of what we have running through our minds at any given moment is repetitive and not helpful. The solution, of course, is to quiet the mind and be in the moment - in stillness. \n \nFor those of us raised with the don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today mentality, being in stillness feels like a big waste of time. The effort to be still and present is huge when the To Do list won't shut up, and when given a few minutes to gather oneself, feels like the perfect opportunity to not be, but to do. \n \nWhen I am able to quiet myself through prayer, meditation, walking, even ironing or folding clothes, emptying the dishwasher, something mindless and repetitive, there is an undeniable peace that is right there for the taking if only I will allow myself to take it. \n \nWhy does giving up worrying feel like giving up? Control. I know that Mary is in full control of things, sees and knows things I can't begin to know, but I feel positively compelled to keep offering her tidbits of advice and a whole bunch of Don't Forgets. \n \nRojo tells me every single day now that he is not going to college and in fact, the minute he's done with high school he's getting married and having his five sons. He is not going to work. His work will be raising his boys. He will hear of nothing else. It's one thing when your three-year-old tells you he wants to grow up and be an astronaut. That's cute. That's appropriate. That's even possible. It's another thing when your 14-year-old child with some big ass special needs tells you his one and only dream is to be a father. It's heartbreaking. \n \nAnd while it's true that he constantly surprises me and is able to do things now I thought we'd never live to see the day he could do, there is a fine line between being hopeful and denial. Between trusting and being naive. Between believing in miracles and being realistic. \n \nI think, for me, the task at hand is to walk that fine line with my eyes toward all possibility, and my mind not on worry, but on being with what is. Gentle, hopeful, peaceful awareness. \n \nAnd what is ain't all bad. While it's true he still can't tie his shoes or brush his own teeth, the boy is surrounded by angels. He is happy. One might go so far as to say blissful. He has his moments of anxiety and stress, but they pass quickly. He has full confidence that his mother and father are working everything out for him. He falls asleep quickly and rests all night knowing when he wakes up his every need will be provided for. There will always be enough. He shall not want for anything. He will be safe.

She had her five-year-old daughter in the passenger's seat and the three of us were going to some mysterious place to me, but known to the two of them. This friend has two older children, and up until that moment I believed that was the full extent of her children: three. \n \nWe drive through underground gates and passage ways, tunnels and alleys and suddenly she's standing outside the car with a tiny baby in her arms. I see her trying to manage the five-year-old and the baby and offer to hold the baby for her. She dramatically pulls the baby to her closer and shifts away from me saying, \"You can go home and read about babies if you want to know more about them!\" \n \nI then proceed to tell her that no one has ever in my life uttered more hurtful words, and I storm off determined to find my own way home, but alas, am hopelessly lost in a maze of darkness and spend the rest of the dream struggling to find her again, as she is my only way out. \n \nPretty sure those aren't the most hurtful words I've ever in my life heard, and now when I type this the whole dream sounds comical, but at the time it felt like a nightmare. \n \nTrying to decide what are the dark and twisty parts of me.

Isn't that interesting that I was so attached to all the stuff that is nearly impossible to give away? \n \nNow the garage is full of stuff I am trying to find the proper home for, and as a last resort, hauling to the dump. We did bring home the couch and love seat that were there. We got the set used for $100 years ago, and have beat them up pretty well since. A couple over-the-counter slip covers are doing the trick, though, and now they are in our basement which is actually turning into the family room I've always wanted it to be, instead of the room at the bottom of the steps with all the *&^% in it. \n \nAs with all room makeovers, what you do to one, spills over to the next. Now I want to haul the piano from the main floor and put it in the new family room. I've never liked where it was placed when we moved, but I have kept it there all these years because that was the only main floor inside wall for it. \n \nIt was all about getting a piano I don't like, in the perfect spot for  it  and not for  us. \u00a0I inherited the piano when my dad died. He never played it. Not once. He acquired it when one of his tenants moved out and didn't take it. It's not my style. It's got emotional baggage. It's big and heavy and takes up a lot of prime real estate on the main floor. But there it's stayed, without question, for seven years. \n \nFinally dawned on me that since I paid nothing for it, don't like it, and am only keeping it around for Rojo to bang on, it does not need, or in fact  deserve \u00a0inside wall status. \n \nYou'll be happy to know that the STM is working on getting a few friends over here, a couple of boards on casters, and hauling that hand-me-down-me-down-me-down piano's ass to the basement and the bad wall it deserves. \n \n \n* Photo from www.clipartguide.com\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.clipartguide.com/_named_clipart_images/0060-0909-2218-2429_An_Upright_Piano_clipart_image.jpg"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2010/10/inside-wall.html", "title": "\nInside Wall\n"},

The good news is those sections are as done as they are going to be until the next draft, and each day I get closer to writing about the fun stuff: Rojo's spiritual brilliance. At the ages I'm writing about now (up to 18 months), he was just a pain-in-the-ass. \n \nThen I try and tackle one long-put-off home project or another. I discovered something about myself these last couple weeks: I don't want to start something if I can't finish it, and of course I can't finish a book or clean a whole basement in one day, so instead of chipping away, I would just postpone the whole entire thing. Now, I'm slowly, slowly-ing several things at once, moving from one \"icky\" task to another, just to keep the momentum going. \n \nWalked into the garage today and almost walked out, but instead took advantage of the warm, dry day to haul a bunch of stuff out of there that was clearly garbage and/or recycling. Filled my car with things to take to\u00a0 ARC \u00a0and the recycling center, and then hopped in the car and did so. Check, check! Didn't finish the garage, not by a long shot, but it looks SO much better already, and that took barely any time/effort at all! \n \nThen I went down to the basement and started hauling stuff into my partially-cleaned garage, ready for the next ARC run (tomorrow). Old duvet covers, lamps, a too-small dog crate for a dog we don't even have, art work I'm sick to death of. \n \nWhat I noticed as I sweated and hauled, went up and down the stairs and started to  feel\u00a0 the difference not just  see \u00a0it, was that almost everything I was giving away wasn't mine originally. No. I was hauling other people's old shit. \n \nI tend to do that a lot - haul things around that weren't mine in the first place, but somehow became so. \n \n Eckhart Tolle \u00a0plays on the ancient boom box as I move through the house.

There I go again storing other people's physical and emotional junk!\" is half the battle.

{"date": "Sunday, September 26, 2010", "body": "\n (My favorite tree here) \n Over 20 years ago my mom moved over to Central Oregon, first Bend, and then Sisters, where she bought a house. First one she bought all on her own. Recently divorced and ready for a new life, she left the grey and rain of the Willamette Valley and started over. She bought a business, ran it for years, then \"retired\" by volunteering for  Habitat for Humanity \u00a0and\u00a0 Together for Children . \n \nI made the three-hour drive across the mountains frequently: before I married STM, after, then eventually hauled Woohoo over and later, Rojo. I nursed my babies in the blue wing-back chair. I taught Woohoo to ride a trike, then a bike in the cul-de-sac. Both kids really got comfortable in water in the development's swimming pool. \n \nEight years ago my mom moved back to Portland and kept her house in Sisters for a get-away for all of us. She's used it less and less as she's re-made Portland her home. We have continued to use it for family vacations and probably most importantly of all, a place for respite for STM and I to separately, and occasionally together, get away to re-group. \n \nI have brought friends here, held retreats, had a few crisis', withdrawn from SSRIs, read a million books, watched every episode of \"Sex and the City,\" numerous times, and slept the sleep of the dead. I have walked the loops around the neighborhood during every phase of fitness, pregnancy, weather and mood. \n \nLast December STM and I were here for two nights alone and we noticed the wood stove wasn't working properly - smoke was coming out, not going up. I called a repairman and arranged for him to come out later, after we'd already returned to Portland. He called us and said, \"I can't get in your house, there is standing water everywhere.\" \n \nThe power had gone out (electric heat) and two pipes had burst when the town had temperatures in the teens for several days, and as I said, no heat. \n \nWe set to cleaning up and repairing the damage. Insurance helped, but we decided it was time to do some long put off updates while we were at it: replacing the single-pane windows with new, getting a new tub/shower to match in color everything else in the bathroom, that kind of thing. The house had never looked better when we were done in late April. STM and I had many difficult talks about the necessity, and perfect timing of now trying to sell it - with the best weather coming and the house looking good, it was time. My mom agreed and knowing she's not getting any younger, was ready to liquidate. \n \nAs we made all the changes we kept in mind,  sell, sell, sell . We went for colors that were neutral, redecorated with Everyone in mind, kept all the kids' artwork off the walls and in their places put up stuff Everyone would like. We picked a brownish carpet, khaki walls, stainless appliances and off-white blinds. Not choices I would have made if I were repairing/replacing/remodeling for myself. Gone was the bright splashes of color. Gone were the family photos. Gone was, well, the very personality of the house. \n \nI think it was at that time that I began to let go. My memories, experiences and nostalgia were washed away with the flood. Newness replaced familiar. Fresh replaced cozy. Everyone replaced the me in this house. \n \nNow there is an offer and it is looking like it will go through. It's time to pack and time to leave. I came over to prepare for STM, who will do all the heavy lifting when it actually does go through. My job it to sort, purge, label and make piles. My specialities, if I do say so myself. \n \nHad a hard time driving over the mountain Friday, actually found myself dragging it out, took a long time getting out the door then made two stops along the way. Didn't want my last trip over here to start. Or finish. Got here and wouldn't you just know it, Nancy was here for her daughter's volleyball tournament. I literally walked in the door and then made contact with her, put on a cooler shirt (gorgeous fall weather), peed and was back out the door - delaying the process even further. Met Nancy at her hotel and we walked into town. We didn't mean to, but we walked by all my favorite haunts. Together. Walking and talking and laughing and sharing, I was able to say goodbye to all \"my\" places. \n \nThen I went back to Nancy's hotel and we had Beer O'Clock with all the other volleyball parents, and I was able to totally forget why I was here, and instead, just enjoy the fact that I was. \n \nYesterday I was going through the kitchen, putting things in piles for the thrift store, things to bring home, things to pack up and save for Woohoo, etc.  What should I do with all this canned food?  \u00a0I thought. Sure, we could use it at home, but we are trying to leave as much of what we don't need as possible. Not 30 minutes later,  I kid you not , three young people came knocking on the door. They were doing a CANNED FOOD DRIVE. Yes! That very day! I have had  maybe \u00a0three other people knock on the door when I've been here  in 20+ years! \n \n \nAs my grandmother used to always say, \"Isn't it wonderful how the Lord provides?\" \n \nAnd that's just it. The Lord is providing. \n \nToday I will say goodbye to this and hello to Something Else.

Venting, venting, venting along the way and suddenly a man pulls over, rolls down the passenger window nearest to us and asks directions to a nearby hospital.

Parents were given their student's schedule and were sent on a mini-day: seven minute classes to meet the teachers and hear their spiels, and five minutes to switch in the halls. Fun to be walking down the halls and see friends of my own and be transported to my own high school days 30 years ago. \n \nWent with my friend Nancy. First got to know Nancy eleven years ago when she was the room parent for morning kindergarten and I was the one for the afternoon class. We coordinated some event that brought the two classes together - can't even remember now what it was, but it seemed of critical importance at the time. Anyway, a friendship began then and took hold when we were chairs of an auction the year our daughters were third graders. \n \nPlanned to meet at the front door when we were both done with \"our\" classes. Saw her talking to Chuck. I know Chuck - has a son our daughters' ages, too. Then came Sally. Know her, too. Also has a daughter the same age. The four of us stood around catching up, marveling that our kids are now juniors. Where has the time gone? How quickly they grow up. Who's driving and who's about to be. That kind of thing. \n \nThen we remembered that Chuck, Sally and I met for the first time, almost twelve years ago, at 5:00 AM one cold January morning as we stood outside the K-8 school, lined up trying desperately to enroll our children when they opened the doors at 7:00 AM. Only a few spots left in kindergarten. We all wanted them. I was particularly nervous because we weren't parishioners. Both Sally and Chuck were not only parishioners, they were graduates. Nervously we waited, chatted, got to know one another, and eventually the doors opened and lo and behold, we all got coveted spots. \n \nThe rest is history. \n \nWent to Rojo's 8th grade mass this morning, he dressed the altar (with some help). He remembered to bow in the right places. He did not talk to anyone he wasn't supposed to be talking to. He's made huge and important strides in his own \"career\" at this little school. \n \nAs the community stood holding hands and reciting the Lord's Prayer, I took a quick glance around. So many stories under one roof. Lots of pain. Lots of suffering. Lots of miracles. Lots of healing. Lots of life lived.\u00a0Together - for better or for worse. \n \nOur closing song was \"We Are One Body,\" with a chorus that repeats, \n\"... and we do not walk alone.\" And that's really it, isn't it, we are one body.

I know in my heart and soul that that is absolutely false, the opposite is in fact true, but my mind has itself convinced that endings are bad and changes brought about by endings are painful, hard, and to be avoided at all costs. \n \n My cousin Emily was here in Portland recently. There was a second memorial service for her husband, and I got to spend more time with her. I told her how much I marveled at her calmness, her it-will-all-work-out-ness, and especially her lack of need for control. \"You're easy to help,\" I said, \"because you allow others to do it, you don't have a way it has to work, you're okay with however it  does \u00a0work.\" \n \"That's because I finally learned that things work out  better  when I don't plan them,\" she said.\u00a0 \n Since that conversation I've been really watching and touching with gentle awareness how true that is in my own life, too.

My plans were good ones, therefore any change to them is bad.

And I'll tell you what my problem is: I can hardly tell the difference between what  is \u00a0my problem, and what is  not. \n \n \nThe problem shows up in all my relationships, but nowhere more so than with my children. Yesterday I spent all day, ALL day, doing the laundry, errands, phone calls, e-mails etc... necessary to get my perfectly capable 16-year-old ready for high school (which starts today for her). I had three e-mail exchanges with her math teacher to determine if the calculator she already has, will, in fact, suffice for this year. I cleared up a problem with\u00a0 Powell's Bookstore , found the books I'd ordered on-line two weeks ago and requested be shipped to a nearby location, and drove to that \"nearby\" location to get her entire year's worth of American Literature reading material. She suddenly remembered that she missed the day when you get your locker assignment (we were out of town) and so we reshuffled the entire day to make that work yesterday. \n \nWent on a walk with Nancy last night and I asked, \"How do other parents do it? Especially those that work? Especially those with a bunch of children? How do they get it all done?\" \n \nOf course that is the answer,  they \u00a0don't get it all done. The world would  probably \u00a0still spin if Woohoo went to high school with the wrong calculator on the first day. She could probably squeak through Am. Lit. with only the book she needs for the first 5 weeks, and then manage to get the other ones eventually. She could probably order a book on-line all by herself. She could probably manage the complexities of a washer and dryer and do her own damn laundry. \n \nPart of my defense is that I have Rojo who cannot fend for himself, whose every need  is  my problem. Part of it is habit. Sixteen years is a long time to do things one way, and it's hard to adjust my parenting according to her ever-developing independence, even though I know that's what's best for both of us. Part of is is sheer practicality. I know that Rojo needs to eat his Trader Joe's spinach pizza AT 5:00 PM each and every day. I know that it takes our oven 20 minutes to heat up to 425 degrees.

{"date": "Thursday, August 26, 2010", "body": "\n Been thinking a lot about the word/concept/notion/ability of some people to be \"selfish.\" Worked with a woman,\u00a0 Ruth King , for awhile, and she pointed out that one of the sources of my rage (and we all have it) is my resistance to being selfish. Actually, what she prescribed was for me to take six months and be completely selfish. \n \nNever did it, and that was years, and what feels like lifetimes, ago. \n \nIt's about a lot of things, this resistance to being selfish: my concept of selfish (bad), my misunderstanding of being Selfish vs. selfish, my confusion over what is being self-loving/caring vs. what is being selfish. It's about my own bias against those I perceive as self-absorbed/self-involved and Selfish. All of that and none of that. It's about what I was taught as a child about God, it's about what I consider being a good mother/wife/friend/daughter. It's about guilt. It's about martyrdom. \n \nFor years I've had a book bubbling in me about Rojo and what I consider his divinity, his special needs that come with incredibly special gifts. I've tried  not  to write the book for a number of years. I wrote a whole different book instead. I've distracted and diverted myself in every way imaginable in an effort to do anything but write this book. \n \nIf you knew how many times a day my mind goes  there,  you'd have me hauled away in a straight jacket. As Rojo is talking I'm thinking of how to write that, where the commas go, the other punctuation, which parts of what he says to keep, which parts to drop, how much of his ADHD the reader can take without going crazy, that sort of thing. Every day, all day long, for years and years. \n \nWhen I went to Iowa to work with 11 other memoirists and one gifted teacher, I went with 20 pages of what I was hoping might turn into  that \u00a0book someday. My pages got workshopped. My pages had life breathed back into them. My pages made me (for the first time in months) want to write  more \u00a0pages. \n \nSo. I have decided to turn this next school year into my Year of Being Selfish. I am going to go big with the question, \"Does this serve my needs?\" when asked to do one of the many things I get asked to do on any given day/week/month/year. If the answer is \"no,\" then I'm not going to do it. \n \nI am going to write this book. The book may never be great, never be sold, never be read, never be anything but  out of me \u00a0and onto the page. And that will be enough. \n \nAmen. \n \n \n \n \n* Photo from http://www.madebyhans.com\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.madebyhans.com/images-jhp/Sanskrit-Alphabet-Letter.gif", "http://ruthking.net/"], "link": "http://carrielink.blogspot.com/2010/08/selfish.html", "title": "\nselfish\n"},

One year it was riding a two-wheeler. Last year it was taking a shower (instead of a bath - a big deal due to his Sensory Processing Disorder). So, for the last year he's showered, but I've helped. I've washed his hair. I've dried him off. I've picked out his pajamas. I've put the dirty clothes in the laundry room, hung up the towel, shut the shower curtain.

AND, they need to shower every single day. Last night he did the shower and hair, but wanted help drying off (crossing the midline is a bitch). \n \nTonight I said, \"Rojo, it's time to go upstairs and take your whole shower by yourself.

I have Post-Its and scraps of paper all over my desk with ideas/phrases/moments that need to get woven into something, but no weaving opportunities. We got home from vacation and it's been nothing but laundry, grocery shopping, errands, appointments, etc. all the things we put off until we got home,  BAM , need to be done,  NOW! \n \nThink I'll resort to my ol' standby, a Top 10 list, hoping to not only clear my mind, but my desk, as well. \n \n \n TOP 10 MARY MOMENTS IN THE LAST FEW DAYS: \n \n10. Someone in my neighborhood (and no, it's not me, but I wish I'd thought of it), puts up the coolest signs along this fence. Today's reads: If you want more love, be more loving. \n \n9. Had an annual family reunion over the 4th of July, was complaining to one of my cousins, she simply said, \"Be blessed.\" I think she actually meant to say (she'd had a couple beers), \"You are blessed,\" which is, of course, very, very true, but it came out as a command, and that was even more helpful. I'll pass along the favor to you: be blessed. \n \n8. Rojo has taken one of my favorite expressions, \"Not enough has been made of...\" and improved it. I can't even remember how it started, I was probably saying it to STM for the 400th time that day, something along the lines of, \"Not enough has been made that I __________,\" because I'm big into him acknowledging each and every thing I do that contributes to the family in the least little bit. Rojo pipes up from the backseat of the car, \"Yea, nothing could be more made than that!\" So. There you have it, nothing could be more made than how cute that is. Nothing. \n \n7. Got all panicky when I heard that someone I was  really  counting on for a critical project, changed jobs - left the company. Then I found out that the person that replaced them has the last name of Divine. Nothing could be more made than that. \n \n6. Flicka and I go for a walk every day. Every day she wants to sniff and pull me in all sorts of directions except the one in which I've decided is \"right.\" Nothing could be more made than she may know more about which direction we \"should\" be going than I do. \n \n5. Had a great talk at the family reunion with two like-minded souls/cousins about 2012 and the \"end of the world,\" and our belief that the \"second coming\" is each of us becoming more conscious and that indeed we are at a tipping point on this planet - it could go either way, it  could , but we know that God promises that \"He\" is love, and love wins. Period. \n \n4. Rojo begged me to take him to the park last night when it was pretty much the last thing on earth I felt like doing, but I went, and of course,\u00a0 The Magic Bench \u00a0did its thing. Again. Had the most incredible conversation with someone that left me in tears. \n \n3. Had to come home and recover from the soul moving Magic Bench experience and numb it out with some \"The Bachelorette,\" complete with rapt attention to Jake and Vienna's gory break up details. This is really not a Mary Moment so much as a clear indicator of just how far I have left to go. \n \n2. Someone asked me to ask Rojo to create a nickname for them (his specialty, or one of them, anyway). Rojo has never met this person. He came up with a nickname in about 1 second, and I e-mailed it along. Turns out that's the name her father called her when she was a little girl. Nothing could be more made than that. \n \n1.
