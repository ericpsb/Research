Date night?\" \n\"Yes, date night, actually it's our anniversary.\" \n\"Oh, right. I remembered that earlier this week. Sorry. \n\"I'm not mad. I made a reservation.\" \n \nthat's\n it. that's what our marriage looks like, a lot of the time; and it \ndoesn't look romantic, or dramatic, or sentimental, but it is real.  \n \n Tranche de vie -- heh, our life sounds better in French . \n \nWhatever language it's in, most pieces of this cake of our life have a big fat rose in the frosting, or some frosting, or at least the cake is baked through most of the way. It's got some flavor. It's worth trying another bite of this 16-year-old cake. \n \na few bites I've loved: \n \n Saying, \"Yes\" to your proposal of \"Will you marinate me?\"  \n Sitting on the rooftop in the fog of San Francisco, taunting the future as we walked with no railings, giddy with youth and libations from the Blue Light. \n Seeing your super-grinning face at the altar 16 years ago, as our pastor quoted Dante, \" Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.\"  \n Eating Chinese food three nights in a row in Paris, and ending each night at that funky little bar with all of the Ex-pats and the star fruit.  \n Spending the day at the Santa Cruz boardwalk after we signed the papers on our house.\u00a0 \n When I told you that the contractions, \"just weren't that impressive.\" and you said, \"I bet you're going to wish you hadn't said that.\" \n Holding hands in the little room where the parents talked about life while our children were in early intervention playgroup on the other side of the glass. Wishing we didn't fit in...fitting in just fine.\u00a0  \n Watching you build the most awesome pop-up camper so we wouldn't need to wake up the entire  cabin in Montana ... and sleeping in that cool camper when there were only three of us squished together, cozy and laughing. \n Snorkeling next to giant sea creatures in Turtle Bay. \n The time when you backed a fully-loaded trailer into a storage unit with \nonly two inches clearance on each side while twenty people watched you \nmaneuver.  \n Nervously anticipating, then seeing the ultrasound of that little dancing-hula babyGirl.\u00a0\u00a0 \n When you held me while I cried a little longer  when the man came to the door to paint the numbers on the curb.   \n Thinking we were  trapped between a steep clover-shaped freeway exit and a too-low over pass  in an RV with two children. \n All the times you wrestle with \"all of those children\" or any of the other stray kids who like to use you as a climbing wall.\u00a0  \n Every Wednesday Music in the Park, and every date night, and any night you try to whisk me out of the house.\u00a0  \n Seeing you laugh so hard I thought you might die while playing Cards Against Humanity. \n Any time you ever wear the Big Red Plaid Coat. It generally means we are happy and cold and with family. \n Friday night at the Lake House, side by side in those awesome chairs with you playing YouTube DJ. Extra love for the nights that our kid comes out of her room to tell us to keep it down. \n When you finally told me last year that you really never, ever, want cheese on your sandwich.\u00a0  \n \nand every other moment when I stop and look around and think, \"This is a great life.\" \n \nBecause it is. No matter how you slice it. \n \nI love you hubbins. Safe travels to you. Perhaps we can  leave Chicago out of our anniversary  next year, or at least be there together.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fUmLqwwlyeY/U9Iby2Op68I/AAAAAAAAVcc/peGav7tBgo0/s1600/jenshawn.jpg", "http://www.haveautismwilltravel.com/2010/08/stuck.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2014/07/grab-fork-this-life-is-great.html", "title": "\nGrab a Fork, This Life is Great.\n"},
{"date": "29 April, 2014", "body": "\n \n Lucy named him Gus. Which was short for Octavius, the mouse\nin Cinderella, and also for Augustus Gloop, the boy from Willy Wonka and the\nChocolate Factory. Gus was a little chubby, but he was good natured and eager\nto please. \n \n My husband is good at picking out the \u201cused puppies\u201d we tend\nto invite into our family. We never get a dog when they are new, only after\nthey\u2019ve been around awhile, maybe had a hard time, maybe they weren\u2019t treated\nvery well, that\u2019s when they come to us, and it is always obvious which dog\nshould come home with us. Gus made it clear he wanted to be our dog when he let\nfour year-old Lucy walk him on a leash, and curled up next to Jake with his\nhead under Jake\u2019s hand to help initiate being pet. He was still not 100% healed\nwhen we got him, and while they were reluctant to let him go, everyone agreed\nit was a good fit. He was ours, and we had only stopped by to \u201ctake a look\naround.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n He was skittish getting into our van the first time. It\u2019s\npossible that given the ubiquity of that car in this state, that he was tossed\nout of one before he was found on the side of the road. We coaxed him in, and\nhe lay down between the kids as if the spot had been built for him. We\nproceeded to eat dinner in the car, over his head, and not once did he try to\nsneak food from us. He was a good dog. He was a perfect addition to our family.\nGus. Such a good boy.\u00a0 \n \n As it turns out, he didn\u2019t really ever retrieve, despite\nbeing a Golden Retriever, and he is the first of that breed I have ever seen\nwho was not motivated by food. Given the amount of edible debris spilled on the\nfloor each day at my house I was not thrilled with this lack of enthusiasm for\nvacuuming. But what he lacked in housekeeping skills, he made up for in\npatience.\u00a0 \n \n That dog was laid on, jumped over, stepped on (by\naccident!), pushed out of the way, scooted out of the kitchen, and chased down\nthe stairs. He was a pumpkin and a princess and a superhero, and a cowboy, and\nmany, many other things that little children can dream up when they are between\nthe ages of 4 and 8. He wore each costume with a slight roll of the eyes, but\nstayed still while little tiny fingers tried over and over to make the\ntoo-small hat fit upon his head. He trick-or-treated next to Jake\u2019s wheelchair,\namid all of those people and didn\u2019t ever make a peep.\u00a0 \n \n Even when I stayed up way too late, hours after the other\nmembers of our family had gone to bed, Gus would wait for me, sitting at my\nfeet, keeping me company in the light of the computer.\u00a0 \n \n It\u2019s not easy to be a part of our family. We are loud, and\nunruly. There is almost always a television, an iPad, and a phone in use at the\nsame time. We travel, to other destinations with more children and more dogs,\nand we over pack, leaving just enough room for living things to fit...just barely.\nOur house has many stairs, and a deck that overlooks the city, and there are\ndeer all over the place outside, creating a life of attractive nuisance; all\nthe deer a dog could want to chase, with none of the barking allowed.\u00a0 \n \n We love those who become a part of our pack, even those\nwho spend their days lounging across the kitchen floor, seemingly in the way of\nevery path to make dinner. With our whole hearts we are thankful for the time\nwe had with Gus, for another bit of fluffy, warm love that we got to have in\nour lives. We were so lucky to find him and so happy he chose us.\u00a0 \n \n He is loved, and he will be missed. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EcGPnumla3k/U2A1YC3i20I/AAAAAAAAU74/xQk-b_YNHPw/s1600/gus.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2014/04/we-called-him-gus.html", "title": "\nWe Called Him Gus\n"},
{"date": "20 May, 2014", "body": "\nMy Mother's day began with pancakes, and coffee, and champagne, and strawberries...followed by a short nap. When I had been properly feted, Lucy said she really wanted to do \"fun stuff,\" so we turned the day towards our children, and what adventure would make every one happy. \n \n To the lake shore! Jake played in the sand, Descartes lounged in the shade, and Lucy and I set about to make a sandcastle. It's one of my favorite things we do together, even though it wrecks my hands, leaving them dried out and cracked every time.\u00a0  \n \nOn our trip home later that afternoon I dug through the console of the car and found lotion to slather on. I rubbed in the moisture, and discovered a few age spots that have appeared. Actually, as if I hadn't seen them in years, all of the scars that I have, seemed to stand out on my hands; a burn from grabbing dinner at the wrong angle from the oven, while shooing away a dog and a kid from the open door. And there, on my left hand is an odd 90-degree-angled scar: two lines, each less than \u00bc inch long. They came from my son's perfectly square tooth. He was two, and that was his only way to tell me that he wanted nothing to do with my art project. (Ironically, I was trying to encourage him to paint Mother's Day note cards for each of his grandmothers.) My hands are keeping track of all of my parenting. \n \n I think Motherhood is like a great scientific experiment.\u00a0 \n \nWhen we begin we have a hypothesis of what we think might happen, who we will be, what our children will be like, how we will teach and discipline, and love and care for our kids. Then it begins, and what follows is a series of trials, endless trials. This mothering lab runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  \n \nAnd every time we think we know where the data is going, when we think we've cornered the answers, and can make predictions, the children grow, life changes, we change.\u00a0 At the end of each trial, if there is a pause longer than a breath, we review the data, check for patterns, then we try to make better decisions about what to do in the next go 'round. \n \nSometimes, a few times, it all makes sense: you have a clear expectation of what will occur, and things play out in exactly that way: I will carry my baby, and that baby will be healthy and enter the world without any struggle. More often, you begin a day expecting one thing and get another, different, but wonderful thing... Silly Putty, Play Doh, and potato chips were each happy, unexpected surprises.  \n \nOther times it looks like nothing you expected, with no books to guide us because we are outside of the norms, and we are stuck on how exactly to Mother. At a loss, we seek counsel from other researchers. But it seems that no one has this motherhood thing down, no one has figured out the one way to perfectly parent children.  \n \nHonestly, there are days when the entire lab seems ready to blow, when I have little tolerance for the details, when there are too many moving parts to keep track of it all; moments when all of the slides smash to the floor, and it's all you can do to find a place to stand while you bleed. Loving this much means that your child's struggles can tear at you, and leave you sleepless, and wrought. Being undone can feel more familiar than having it all together.  \n \nOf course there are breakthroughs-- moments of clarity. Moments when you stand back and you can see that the work, this life, your family, has taken on its own cadence, and there is a peace in watching your children move on their own, safely, happily, greeting the world with kindness. You have presented a part of your data set and perhaps you get to know, briefly, that your work is good, that you are on track.  \n \nI'm just another phase in this trial, and my work is made easier because of those who have done this before me. I thank all of the women from whom I have learned, all of the women who pushed the boundaries for what being a woman and being a mother means. I am grateful for the enduring support of my peers, and the advice from my elders.  \n \nWhen I find myself alone with my thoughts at the end of the day, I ask, \n \nDid I give to my children more than I took? \n \nDid I endeavor to show patience when my grace was running low?  \n \nDid I love so deeply that my children feel it, even as they create their own space in the world, apart from me? \n \nDid I break their falls just enough so that they bruised, but did not break, even though my heart ached with every moment they struggled?  \n \nDid I put my hands into the sand without reservation, and play with the earth alongside her little fingers? \n \nDid I listen to, and honor, my son's voice even when no one else can hear a word? \n \nDid I help them learn to choose the right thing, even when it does not benefit us; to choose to be kind, though it could be easier to be callous?  \n \n \n*** \n \nI am rarely satisfied with how I finish a day, especially when it comes to my work as a mother, but I am learning, that in this grand experiment I will often fail myself, and my kids, sometimes spectacularly. I do know that they are worth every trial, and when it is all written down in the end, the conclusions in the lab \nreport of my life, I can only hope that I have continued to move the \nline on what it means to parent, and that somehow I've created some beauty in this world by helping\n shape my children. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ruch8-OBxM4/U3uwOdEiB6I/AAAAAAAAU-Q/wXc8UeEcZTA/s1600/IMG_3562+copy.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2014/05/motherhood-and-scientific-method.html", "title": "\nMotherhood and the Scientific Method\n"},
{"date": "10 October, 2013", "body": "\nToday I am over...giant backpacks, barking dogs, spilled water on the \nkitchen floor, the need for caffeine to remain awake, and the arrogance of the people who run stop signs. \n \nBook keeping, \nrefinancing, infighting, and adult acne remain top contenders for the best thing to add to a bad day to make it worse. \n \nAnd while non-pologists can be ironic, their words are merely placeholders for the sadness that fills the space while we wait for contrition. \n \nLoose pages of \nelementary school work, broken pencils, the desperate need for a 9-volt battery, eczema, and any \nother reasons skin itches, rashes, or flakes should only be doled out in the smallest of portions to anyone who also needs to bathe children, or themselves, or requires oxygen on a regular basis. \n \nI could also do with a break from \"cure speak,\" ungrateful people, \nchicken in any form, traveling spouses, and inane homework questions. \n \nI wouldn't mind if the hoops we jump through to procure medical devices would dissolve into puddles of rainbow sherbet, and I don't even like rainbow sherbet. \n \n \nAnd I've been thinking, the world would be better off without political posturing, lack of civility, callous disregard for fellow citizens, self-absorption, and those who litter. And domestic abuse, there's really no positive benefit to that at all.  \n \nThe buzz from fluorescent lights, laundry that sours in an hour, and that little grit that remains in some of the travel mugs when they've been through a full dish cycle-those things should be abolished. \n \nI don't think anyone should need to have a splinter until they can afford to buy their own tweezers and extract the little bugger themselves; it just seems unfair. \n \nOn the other hand I could listen to Lorde singing Royals once an hour, for this week, at least, and my son's teacher makes him laugh, and learn, and he skips to the school bus each morning. We could use more people like her in our school systems. \n \nAnd every single day, the view from my window is only beautiful or better. \n \nI have a blister on my heel, which would seem to be troublesome, but I have two kinds of band-aids to choose from, and how many days of my life will I be able to choose Angry Birds *or* Hello Kitty to heal a wound. \n \nIt's small things that build upon each other that make the difference between alive and living.  \n \nMy children still like me to read to them, and when we don't start our day in a pile of parents and children, snuggled-in for 'cozy cuddle time', we all miss it.\u00a0  \n \nWe have enough, and then some, and a little to give to someone else if they need it. \n \nWe have friends who we trust to share how hard this life is sometimes, people who get it, and sometimes we are called upon to help, so we know we are trusted too. \n \nMy mind can still be changed with better information, and my heart is filled to bursting on a regular basis. \n \nSo if in the face of irritations I can be open to learn, or when confronted with pettiness, I am still able to love, I am hard-pressed to say that, for at least a moment, I have experienced anything less than success. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2013/10/cluttered-mind.html", "title": "\nCluttered Mind\n"},
{"date": "18 September, 2013", "body": "\nMy boy is home sick for the third day. He's in good spirits, but his nose is so runny that it's not fair to him or to his classmates and teachers to send him to school. So we are at home together, just the two of us. \n \nWe do our own thing. He plays in the back yard. I scan endless papers into the computer hoping that I will eventually not feel overwhelmed by the number of trees lying about my house in 8 1/2 by 11 inch slivers. \n \nWe meet every ten minutes or so, fifteen if I can hear his happy sounds through the open door, and five if I can't hear him at all. It's a good arrangement. I wipe his nose, spray sunblock and offer to put on a show if he wants to lie on the couch. He lets me clean his face, and takes my hand when I invite him in for lunch.  \n \nHe loves  shumai , little dumplings. And after a little searching I have found him petite, one bite shrimp shumai at the intimidating, but cool, \"all of Asia and other Ocean-y places and don't forget the half shelf of Mexico\" store. I add chopped up pineapple, a banana, and lunch is served. \n \nWe alternate between me feeding him bites and him taking the loaded-fork to do it himself. He asked for more watered-down limeade by rolling his cup to me. I asked him if he liked the shumai. \n \n He made a lot of higher-pitched \"Ye-aa-AHH\" sounds, and clapped his hands together and turned towards me and smiled. \n \n\"I'll take that as a \"Yes?\" \n \n\"Ye-aA-AAA!\" \n \nand so I know he likes them. Awesome. My kid has the mad eating skilz. And then I sat there next to him, and it flashed over me, as if I had never thought of it: \n \nmy son doesn't really talk. \n \nWhoa. How is that even possible? I mean, how did my kid develop, and grow up to be this almost thirteen year-old who doesn't talk? It was, for a moment, the strangest thing I had ever heard of. \n \nIt must be similar to the feeling that other people, those who do not have contact with people like my son, react when I tell them not to expect him to communicate in words. It must be an odd concept to grasp if you do talk, and your whole family talks, and everyone in your family for generations back has used spoken language, and your circle of friends, well, they all speak too. Not speaking must seem like a really big, daunting, overwhelming, horrible thing. \n \nI felt for the first time how foreign that might seem to people who don't live with a person who communicates differently. \n \nand I didn't feel sad for Jack. or for myself. \n \nI actually felt a little sad for all of those people who don't know my kid. Not only because he is a cool kid, because he is, but because communicating with Jack is, on a regular basis, so much more meaningful than communicating with an average person. \n \nWhen he expresses what he needs, and I understand him, it is one of the best feelings I have, one of the best feelings I will ever have, until the next time it happens. The sense of accomplishment and relief I feel when I have understood his desires, when I have actually heard what he is 'saying', when I have met him where he is, instead of expecting him to come all the way to me... I feel amazing and successful, and he, most importantly, HE is so damn happy that I got it right. \n \nParenting win! Happy child!  \n \nBecause that's what we all want, to be heard, to be understood. We want to have someone interact with us where we are, as we are. \n \nAnd I'm not saying that it is not challenging, for me, or his dad, or his sister, or his grandparents, or for any of the people who try to educate him in classrooms, because it is. It  is  frustrating to want to know what he thinks: Does he want to go to the street fair or stay home? Does he know the names of the planets? Does he want to watch a movie or play in the backyard? What does he dream about? Does he really enjoy road trips? Does it bother him when I run the dishwasher after he goes to bed? Are his shoes comfortable? And to be honest, it's not always easy to consider an entire other being's paradigm, when I am not always sure of my own needs.  \n \nI imagine however, that it is much more frustrating to have all of the answers to those questions and more, and not be able to tell someone. To know exactly, precisely, what you want, and be unable to convey your opinion, on how much salt to put on the eggs, or where you would like to spend spring break. \n \nOr to have all the questions-- what if he has all the questions: Why can't you take pictures of stars? What's the deal with Stonehenge? Who invented pizza? Will time travel ever be possible? What if you had all of the questions, and couldn't ask a single one of them? \n \nAnd I'm just guessing, but it must be frustrating to be  this close  to conveying what you want to have happen next, but the person with whom you are interacting gave up listening too soon, didn't wait for your answer, or worse, assumed you didn't have a clue as to what was happening at all. \n \nI worry that he is bored, and that is a terrible thought. I find myself \nreally trying to tease out what is disability, from what is his disinterest.  \n \nThis conundrum seems more real to me lately as Jack gets older; he is an age that I can distinctly remember. And I'm finding I spend a lot of time unraveling the emotional mess of wondering what are my hopes or my delusions and what are realistic expectations, and that is all tied up with the respectful presumption that my son understands the world around him.  \n \nBut when it comes down to it, I believe he has a lot to say. \n \nI don't get it right every time, probably most times. I guess wrong, I \nforget to ask, I don't explain something that's happening, even though I\n know it could probably be a teaching moment.  \n \nBut I try. He lets me know when I am on the right track. \u00a0  \n \nMy communication with my son is harder for me than the ease I have with other people. It takes more discipline for me to wait for his answer when I am used to buzzing around. I can't multi-task and still get the gist. It makes me think more. Yes, it makes me tired, sometimes exasperated, but I think it is making me more thoughtful in those other conversations with the rest of the world, and engaging with him is worth it every time. \n \n \n\u00a0*** \n \n \nLunch is over. I ask him a few more questions trying to determine what should happen next on this stay-at-home day. I finally understand, \"play outside.\" He is out the door in a flash, his smiling face thankful that I guessed right. He claps his hands, and lets out a whoop. \n \nI'm smiling too, because really, how often do any of us get that kind of recognition for anything we do? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shumai", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HSAFhu8SrRE/Ujo8COq0yVI/AAAAAAAASsY/Yl4T-l6Aess/s1600/240px-Siumaai.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2013/09/meaningful-communication.html", "title": "\nMeaningful Communication\n"},
{"date": "24 April, 2014", "body": "\nThe building was huge, a true monstrosity whose architect was clearly \ninfluenced by the creepiest aspects of a poorly laid out mall, an \nabandoned naval yard, with just a whimsy of the dark garage of the \nneighbor you were never supposed to visit as a kid. \n \nI'm not sure what happened first.\u00a0 Did I know something wasn't right, or \ndid they tell me they had \"lost track\" of my son? I just remember that \nthe two women standing there behind the flimsy stanchion and rope \"gate\"\n looked both unsurprised, and only slightly worried, mostly about losing their \njobs, and not about my lost son. My mostly nonverbal, does not come if beckoned, additionally taxed with cerebral palsy, and thus has poor fine \nmotor skills, son. He is beautiful and funny and one of my true loves, \nbut one thing he is not, is a boy who can be left alone. \n \nanger. \n \nIt's hard to convince people to take it seriously. To lock the gates \nbehind them, ensure the fence has no openings, make sure the dog door is\n closed. Hard for others to see that a deck with a low railing is really not safe enough, and if you add a chaise lounge next to the rail, so as \nto make it easier to rest your drink, you've just created a giant step to leap right over. It's hard to explain why just holding his hand in the \nparking lot does not guarantee safe passage, because he is strong now, \nand has moves like Houdini, able to twist his hyper mobile arms out of\n being held.  \n \npanic. \n \nI'm sure that's what it feels like for him, that he is ever-captive, \nwith no freedom to go about his day as he might choose. No matter how \nmany engaging choices he makes, I can't leave the back gate open to let him \nexplore, I can't sit in my chair on the sand as he walks along the \nshore. I have, or someone has, or someone should have, a hand on him \nalmost all the time, any time we leave the confines of our house; he is \nensnared. \n \nSo it's not surprising that he would have escaped under not-too-watchful\n eyes, and was now wandering in this poorly-lit labyrinth of a building.  \n \nfear. \n \nI run down the corridor, but I know this is not where he would have \ngone. He's no fool, and would dart into a smaller walkway as soon as \npossible to avoid detection. I can see him across the abyss from one \nviewing station to another, four stories of art and science, and humans \nbelow us. I look to find the stairs on my side to head down to the level\n he's going to, but when I look back across, he has disappeared into a \nshadow again. \n \nloss. \n \nI'm alone in this. I can't get ahold of my husband, my daughter is too \nyoung for this responsibility, and yet I ran and left her with the very two \npeople who lost my son. My daughter. I've just left her. I just turned and ran. \n \nThe phone in my hand is uselessly filling with voice mails \nthat say, \"if you can't handle it, let me know, and I can come help. If you can't handle it...\" \n \nshame. \n \nIt seems I am surrounded by an entire nation of people who do not get it, who \nwalk by, either staring at my plight or avoiding me. No one who can, will\n help, and those who don't know how, are scared to ask. It's just me in \nthis giant, horrible building where none of the signs make sense, and \nthere are only open tread stairs between floors, and everything is \nechoey as I run, madly, searching for my son, hoping my daughter will somehow remain safe-enough until I return. \n \n \n*** \n \nI woke with a clenched jaw and a headache painfully draining any good \nthoughts I might have had, and as the light seeped between the curtains, I begged the sun\n to tell me that it was just a dream. \n \nAnd then I am clearly, fully awake, and I wander to the children's rooms to check on them, even though it is obvious we are not scattered through some other building. \n \nI peek at my daughter lying on top of her covers, flat on her back. She looks like Snow White, with her hair framing her fair face, her ruby lips turned lightly at the corners; she sometimes smiles when she's sleeping, and that seems to make me think her life is pretty good.  \n \nMy son is equally safe,\u00a0 a tangle of teenager in his extra-long twin bed that is already looking too small for him. His leg is draped over the side, unwound from the covers, looking like a specimen of the perfection of man, with muscle and strength showing even through sleep.\u00a0 His toes are set lightly upon the ground, like a sprinter sets their foot, ready to press off and beat the track down with perseverance. \n \nI sigh at the wonder of them, and try to shake the chill of that unforgiving, other dimension. \n \nI am ever-thankful that it was all a dream, but I realize, even hours later, with both of them safely at school, that I remain a little distanced from the present. I worry that some of that panic, and fear, and anger, some of that shame and threat of loss, I wonder if I carry a bit of those things around all the time, and that is a little unsettling. And I wonder how much of it is manufactured and how much of it is real? What is my business to figure out, and what are things I wish would change in the world around us?  \n \n Our every day has a lot of good in it. There's laughter and hard work, and good food, and adventures, and there's movie night and family snuggling. There are friends and family and celebration. So this night, when I sleep,\u00a0 I will push away the dark and dreary, and envision instead our average day, our filled-with-so-many-good-things, average day, and when I close my eyes there will be my Snow White and my young, Strong-man, because the people they are, our little life- it's the stuff that dreams are made of.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Our revels now are ended. These our actors,  \n As I foretold you, were all spirits, and \n Are melted into air, into thin air: \n And like the baseless fabric of this vision, \n The cloud-capp'd tow'rs, the gorgeous palaces, \n The solemn temples, the great globe itself, \n Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, \n And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, \n Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff \n As dreams are made on; and our little life \n Is rounded with a sleep.

{"date": "28 January, 2014", "body": "\nLast night my baby girl had her first migraine. Or maybe it wasn't a \"real\" migraine, but it was a headache so big, that it made her cry on the floor, holding her little seven-year-old head, while afraid to touch her scalp. It made her need help lying down for fear that that her head would 'crash.' She wept and moaned, and looked scared by how the pain took over her entire brain and she told me it made her unable to think of anything else. \n \n \n \n myGirl at 7 \n \nShe didn't have the aura that I get, though she found it painful to read or look at light. It was a headache that built up over the course of the day, and had not diminished after water, food, exercise, or relaxation. She was so miserable, and almost unable to be understood between her sobs and pleas for help. \n \n \nWe have the tools to make those kind of headaches go away at our house, and so with a cool glass of water and a magic melting pill (Maxalt) she was able to crawl into bed, and lay flat, and eventually her swollen eyes closed, and she slept. She awoke today pain-free and chipper from a solid night's sleep.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n***\u00a0 \n \nI don't sleep all the way through the night very often, between checking on children, and restless dogs and the occasional bouts of snoring (mine or my husband's, or the dog's) I awake at least once an hour, and I get out of bed 3-4 times a night to be sure that the hatches are truly battened down and no one has escaped, or died. But mostly I fall back asleep easily, unless there is something big playing around in my mind. \n \nLast night, each time I awoke, I realized I had been expecting something. I listened each time waiting to hear the sounds of un-soothed uneasiness. I had been expecting Lucy to be throwing herself around her room, or sobbing, or screaming in pain, because I had been triggered, and I remembered all of those horrible nights when Jake was younger. All of those days we had before we knew he had migraines.  \n \nWatching Lucy on the floor of the hallway last night so upset, barely able to speak, I realized how lucky we are that we figured out Jake's headaches at all. Right in front of me was my eloquent daughter with all of her ability to speak, unable to communicate her needs; how did Jake ever stand a chance?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n myBoy at 7 \n \nIt took us years-- years of testing, and reading, and researching, years of praying, with people we barely know, praying. We drove 'round and 'round, and devised elaborate set-ups to rock him gently even when his body was too big to be held in the gliding chair, or the IKEA swing. We hired caretakers to allow us to sleep, knowing that he would be crying and screaming all night long. We made his twin bed into a giant gated box so he could at least throw himself down onto the mattress over and over again. We took turns holding his hand as he leapt up from between us in our bed and threatened to fly off onto the floor. We tried to keep him safe even as he knocked into and broke our noses, and his grandparents' glasses. We tried to keep him eating and drinking. I remember holding him, crying with him, and making him every promise to\n try to help him, feeling like I was failing when I had to take a break \nand pass his care to my husband. He was at least seven before we had a handle on it. \n \nAnd for all of it, as bad as it was for Descartes and I, and how ashen we got, and how it affected our friendships, and our careers, and our health, and our marriage. I know that it was so much worse for Jake. It was so obvious he was in pain, but no spinal tap, MRI or genetics test could tell us why he was biting at his own hands in frustration. You can still see the scars on his beautiful hands. \n \nThose years before we figured out the migraines are often a blur, sometimes other people need to remember them for us, but I do recall how sad Jake was. So very, very sad. I remember the desperate look in his eyes, like he wanted out of his own body. I remember how he yelled at me, and I just kept hoping that the sounds would turn into words that I could understand, so I could help him. Not being able to soothe him was the most helpless feeling I've ever had.  \n \nHe had all those sounds, and actions, and giant movements (despite his cerebral palsy), to try to tell me something, and I just couldn't understand the one thing he wanted to tell me: Mom, I have a migraine.\u00a0  \n \n \n*** \n \n \n \nSometimes people in the online-world think that Jake must have very few needs because I speak about parenting him without saying things like \"I hate autism.\" or \"Autism can suck it today.\"\u00a0 I have never felt like something \"stole my child,\" or that the \"real child\" is \"hidden behind the autism.\" I don't believe that saying there is an \"autism epidemic\" helps my child, or my family. I don't believe that autistics are burdens on society. But just because I don't buy in to all of that doesn't mean I don't find this particular flavor of parenting harder than I thought it would be. It doesn't mean that I don't sometimes long for my son to encounter the world with fewer hurdles. It doesn't mean that I don't want, sometimes, for things to be different than they are.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nBut those notions or longings and desires are not always about autism, and my guess is that similar wistful thinking happens for all kinds of parents and people all the time.\u00a0 I don't need to hate autism to want my son to have an easier time at things, just like I don't hate being tall just because no store-bought clothing ever fits me properly. Autism is intrinsic to who he is, and you can't hate a part of your child and not have that child feel like they are damaged goods.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI don't hate autism. I hate migraines.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bVMimHYsH9U/UugTOvJIxsI/AAAAAAAAUSQ/Scdf3nOAtBQ/s1600/IMG_3103.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SfJtW3_s6UE/R17WLMpyFDI/AAAAAAAAA34/Cggbvt1fwRg/s1600/CIMG4174.JPG"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2014/01/i-dont-hate-autism-i-hate-migraines.html", "title": "\nI Don't Hate Autism, I Hate Migraines. \n"},
{"date": "01 April, 2014", "body": "\n Over the last few weeks I scanned-in, then shredded, thousands of pages of our life, old documents that were taking up space. The guest room is not a place where old memories should go to die, and so I pulled out a giant bin and began re-living moments of pain, distress, and joy as I watched old bills, prescription leaflets, and holiday cards float across my table. I cried a little, smiled a lot, and more than once clutched a few sheaves against my chest wondering how we moved past some of the hurdles in our past. \n \nI was amazed by how many pages I remembered instantly, where I was, how tired, or happy, or anxious the words made me at the time. When I hauled those bags out to the recycling bin, and there will be more of them, I poured in those pieces of paper and I knew these things: \n \n I really didn't need to keep most of that paper in the first place. \n I now have a digital copy if I ever need it again. \n My brain has a lot more room in it now that it is not holding on to \"Where is that specific paper from 2004?\" \n \nMore importantly, sifting through all of those documents, medical and educational, family journal pages and scraps of paper, I was able to see how my son has grown. His IEPs have finally taken shape and the words on them really matter; there were milestones and he has met them. There were medical queries and they have been answered.  \n \nIt is obvious that being hopeful is never a mistake. Before we used the words \"presume competence,\" I can see that we tried, and as we've grown in understanding, we've expanded our thinking, changed our behavior, and developed expectations for ourselves and our family. \n \nWe're not done figuring things out, but at least I know there's a little more room to do it now. \n \n \n*****  \n \nIt's Autism Acceptance month at  Thinking Person's Guide to Autism.

{"date": "10 September, 2013", "body": "\nJust after  the recent murder of Alex Spourdalakis , yet another parent has attempted to  murder her autistic child. \n \nServices to help families are not available to the degree they are needed, often leaving parents of children with intense needs feeling abandoned, depressed, suicidal and, in some cases, homicidal.  \n \nI just sincerely wish these conversations could be separate. They must remain separate.  \nI know how it happens, how the conversations seem like they should go together. As parents of kids with intense needs, medical, mental or physical, we are each slogging through life, with easy days and hard days and harder days, until something really bad happens, then we are triggered to say to the world, \"See, look how hard this is. Why doesn't anyone care?\" But the problem is that caregivers say this at the very same same time that someone was  trying to kill their child . The minute you tie those ideas together the conversation changes into, \"See, look how hard this is. We told you. Have empathy. The poor mom was really struggling. You can't blame her.\"  \n \nBut you can. You must blame her. We must unitedly and unequivocally say that we can blame her because she tried to murder her child, and those other caretakers, they actually killed their children. We can't \"cut her slack\" because she was having a hard time. We can't even cut her slack because she had been injured by her child, badly. We cannot say, \"We understand why she did it. You know her life was so hard because of her daughter,\u00a0 because she didn't have enough help, because she was burned out, because...\" Because what? So what do you mean exactly? So it's understandable when there are days or weeks, when life is hard... \n \nLike when my son didn't rest...for years?  \n \nHe didn't sleep, he screamed. He bit himself \nuntil he bled. He bit us and we bled. He lashed out. He threw himself to the ground. He \nbroke my nose. He gave black eyes to me and one to his grandmother. We went to doctor after doctor, and therapy after therapy to no avail. We had no medical insurance for him because he had pre-existing conditions. We paid the bills with credit cards. Our life fell apart a little bit, a lot of the time, for several years. There are parts, emotional parts, that are still raw. It was very hard. I was very sad, and hope was hard to find on most days. So because it was hard, because almost every hard thing led back to my precious boy who was beside himself writhing in some kind of anguish that no one could identify, unable to speak to us and tell us what was wrong, so it would have been okay to kill him?  Of course not.   \n \nNEVER OKAY. \n \n...and I know some of you know her, that mother, and maybe I'd feel differently if I did, but I don't. I can tell you this, if my best friend tried to kill her son, you can bet your ass I'd want her in jail. I would feel horrible. I would be certain that I had failed her as a friend. I would mourn the loss of my friendship, but those things are about me, and it would not change the fact that we cannot even intimate that there are excuses as to why we can kill our kids. I would want her in jail, held accountable without question.  We can add in all of the complexities of our weak \nfamily support systems, and lack of services, and all of those complexities may\n be real and truly horrific, but they do not, ever, explain away the \nfact that this woman tried to kill her child. \n \nWe can't cross that line if we want everyone to value our kids and give \nthem an equal place in society, because  in every other way that's what \nwe ask people to do.  We want our children to have a place in a proper educational setting, and we want them to be able to go to the movie theater and grow to have meaningful work, and a safe place to live, and all sorts of basic rights. Then when it comes to the most important right, the right to live, that's where you cross the line? \n \nI thought we had all decided that we don't want our children to be\u00a0 \n marginalized and put to death because they do not contribute enough to society . Don't we want our children to be treated as deserving to be called wholly-human? A human who has every right not to be murdered because of their neurological makeup?  \n   When\n we tie the two conversations together it glares at me, and I am not autistic, so I \ncannot imagine what it would feel like to be autistic and read that \na parent could, \"see how that could happen.\"  \n I don't think most parents think that's what they are saying when \nthey offer empathy, but even said eloquently, this  is all I hear...my autistic\n child is not as valuable. \n \n \nbut there can be no excuses.\u00a0 \n \nWe Do Not Cross the Line.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/12/alex-spourdalakis-killed_n_3429030.html", "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/michigan-mom-kill-autistic-teen-daughter-cops-article-1.1448694", "http://www.heavy.com/news/2013/08/autistic-boy-hate-lette/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/416488581726980/permalink/589583071084196/?comment_id=589889387720231&offset=0&total_comments=79"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2013/09/we-do-not-cross-line.html", "title": "\nWe Do Not Cross the Line\n"},
{"date": "08 August, 2013", "body": "\nMany of us have made deep and meaningful relationships that exist only online. I have felt loved, protected, cherished and helped by people who I have never stood next to. And for all of the ways that it has also allowed strangers to call me names, or generalize me into stereotypes that I am thankfully aware, do not apply to me, the Internet has mostly given me a  sense of community , a  platform to do good works , a way to connect with other people in similar situations, and an ability to carve my life up into little segments where I am able to learn the language of advocacy, friendship, shared interests, or home organization.  \n \nAnd because the Internet doesn't require plane fare, and is rarely guided by a strict sense of time, this community has been available whenever I have needed it, from wherever I am. I'd say, overall, that I am a wholly better person for knowing the people I have met online. Those relationships have depth, and have endured for years, even as some of my neighbors have moved, or families around me have split up. \n \nSo then I am walking down the hall of a Sheraton in Chicago and a bright voice calls to me, \"Jen! Jen! Hi, it's *so* great to see you!\" and I am instantly mortified because I have no idea who this person is...until I read her tag, and wait, Yes! I DO know who she is! And I know about her precious son, and her new baby, and that we have talked about all of these little details of life already, and now she is here in front of me. \n \nI've just met an old friend. \n \nAnd BlogHer is one of those experiences \nwhere you get the feeling that you are always just about to run into a \nlong lost friend, or a new best friend, or a perfect career opportunity, or someone who will make you think differently, or maybe you will just get a chance to hug a person who managed to hold your hand from far away. Or you will be thanked, to your face, for writing something that made a person's life easier, better, more manageable, because something you wrote made their life bearable on a day they didn't think they could get through.  \n \nI really enjoyed all the pieces of me being stitched together this year. I got to speak, well, really I was supposed to manage a round table with  Ellen Seidman , but of course I spoke a bit, because when, ever am I quiet for that long. And I got to learn, and cry a bit, hearing from  Pamela Merrit  who is ahead of me in many, many, ways, and helps me see the long road. She's leaving a clear cut behind her, and for that I am grateful. \n \nI got to stay up late and chat,  meeting someone  wonderful, then spending hours talking about our children before figuring out the degrees of separation between us, (her friend is married to a man who sang at the wedding of the man who was the best man in my wedding....among other connections). \n \nThey \"liked my schtick\" in Chicago. It felt good to be funny, and have people like me being funny, and thanking me for lifting their spirits. I'm sure they would tire of me, but for those short hours I loved making my friends laugh. I love to laugh, and I love it when our table is laughing the most, happy to be stared down by others who are not fortunate enough to guffaw, perhaps inappropriately, especially at themselves. \n \n \n \n \n \nI walked a million miles, ate a lot of food that made me think I could add a few items to my family's diet, and only had one migraine. While it's true I am an extrovert, I've figured out that expo centers, with their bright white expanses and tall ceilings and two-story escalators, suck at my life force, and I will be happier in the future if more of the functions and sessions are held in the confines of a cavernous hotel, where I have a chance to run back to my room for something, or rest for 20 minutes. (I'll also be happy if, next time, dropped-to-my-room-swag does not include a full-sized Denny's menu with accompanying cupcake cup, and a set of size-your-own-bra cups that we used for many, many other things before leaving them behind.) \n \nI'm glad I went. From the cab ride I shared with a lovely woman who is moving to California in a few months, to the giant pretzel that practically called me names, from  meet ups  and  new friends , from the  lunchtime party  at a back table, to  shutting down  the  karaoke party  (without my needing to get  up on that stage  and fall over), to the great information, interesting keynotes, and  a new friend  who made leaving and airport-waiting bearable, BlogHer13 was a great conference.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/thinkingpersonsguidetoautism", "http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/", "http://www.lovethatmax.com/", "https://twitter.com/SharkFu", "http://pinterest.com/followcharlotte/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pUpbJ14xm2I/UgP9Qo5l2OI/AAAAAAAASlw/3VBh-0ZxM7M/s1600/1004501_10151783897631635_522393196_n.jpg", "http://www.jordansadler.net/", "http://canapesun.blogspot.com/", "http://wouldashoulda.com/", "http://www.autismtwins.com/", "http://www.stimeyland.com/", "http://awfullychipper.blogspot.com/", "https://twitter.com/BAoki"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2013/08/pieces-of-me-at-blogher13.html", "title": "\nPieces of Me at BlogHer13\n"},
{"date": "01 November, 2012", "body": "\nFor the most part, most people, would say that my son is non-verbal. That is a clinical diagnosis. I use the term when I am explaining his needs to a caretaker or an education professional. I hate saying it though, not in the \"we should use the term pre-verbal instead of non-verbal,\" but more in the way of, \"I can't believe that people don't actively recognize that there are many, many ways to communicate.\" \n \nJake has a lot to 'say.' He has opinions, and finds things funny. He has preferences. He shows varying amounts of affection depending on who you are. He wants to go some places and not others, and can tell by where we are driving if we are getting close to camp, or home, or the Lake House, or Tahoe. He is clear about when he is done with a situation. And he has all of this without being \"verbal.\" \n \nThe more we interact with Jake as if he does have something to say,  to no one's surprise,  he does have something to say! Treating him with that respect, is uncomfortable for some people. Without the feedback that he has heard you and with no verbal response to gauge when they should begin the next bit of story or query,\u00a0 even well-intentioned people can feel like they are dangling there, unsure of how to move the conversation. Those people who do address him directly in conversation, however rare that is, even those conscientious people wait for an answer from him. They, we, the world, talks at him. And then they talk to me about him, in front of him. \n \nSome of it is just going to happen because of logistics, or pressing need, or the fact that he is still a young boy. Some of it happens in the exact same way with my daughter who is filled with words that spill comfortably out of her mouth. Talking about your children in front of them happens, and giving an answer for your kid probably happens more than it should. Truly we are just an impatient society, always ready to jump to the next thing; get the answer, move on. \n \nBut we can \"listen\" for Jake's responses if we pay attention, and I should do a better job of explaining some of the ways he communicates, at the very least, so others can benefit from his humor. \n \nWe've never done this before, so I am still learning. Certainly my feelings have changed over the years from just wanting my son to talk, and thinking that saying words aloud was the end game.\u00a0 Now I understand that the really important thing is that Jake be able to communicate his needs. It doesn't matter how he does it. Maybe there will be a device, like an iPad, that helps him string words together so we can easily read them. Maybe he will use more gestures. Regardless, I no longer think that there is only one way to \"talk\" and I realize that really listening requires a more open mind. \n \n \n*** \n \n \nLast night was Halloween, and we had planned to trick-or-treat through the neighborhood with a group of friends with Jake walking a little, then using his wheelchair. We would be accompanied by his aide. Knowing that he gets tired earlier than a lot of kids, we already had a built-in escape plan for Jake, with an early departure via car should he want to go home with his aide. \n \nWe got the kids ready in their costumes, and as I was gathering the rest of the items we would need, flashlights, bottles of water, extra bag, lightweight jackets, Jake whooped once then ran down the stairs, in full costume, and got into his bed. \n \nFace down in the pillows I went to talk to him. I explained that he would not be in trouble, and no one would be mad if he decided not to go out house to house. I waited, sitting there, then offered that if he did want to go, he needed to get up with me now because we had to meet people, and that the decision was his. Perched on the edge of his bed, I waited, watching his back rise and fall calmly as he breathed. \n \nAll at once he sat up in bed, so precious in his Star Wars get-up, and looked at my face for a moment. Then he flopped back down on the bed and buried his head under the pillow. \n \nOkay. Got it. No trick-or-treating. \n As his sister and I left the house his aide was helping him into more comfortable sleeping attire, and I heard a familiar, happy squeee and the sound of the headboard hitting the wall as his almost teenager body slammed back onto the mattress. Reports are that he was sound asleep within ten minutes.  \n \nIn the past I would have a) gotten him out of bed and walked him to the car, 'encouraging' him to participate in this annual ritual that American children cherish, or b) allowed him to stay at home, but walked away feeling like I was somehow cheating him by not including him in the outing, and no matter what I would have c) felt guilty that I was forcing him to do something, or felt guilty for abandoning him (and ultimately making my night easier, because most of the world is really not ADA accessible, so wheelchairs and Halloween do not go together very well.) In the past, I would have decided what Jake would be doing based on what I felt was the best decision, calculating everything from my point of view. \n \nInstead, I left the house confident that he made the decision. I asked him, I double checked, I waited for an answer. He told me clearly what he wanted to do...and then I honored his wishes without attaching any frustration, or blame, or guilt, or sadness.  \n \nHis communication was very clear. He didn't need to spew a soliloquy for me to hear him, I just had to know that he had something to say. \n \n \n Autistics Speaking Day \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticsspeakingday.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/11/autistics-speaking-day.html", "title": "\nAutistics Speaking Day\n"},

{"date": "17 April, 2013", "body": "\n My blood pressure just shot up so high I was seeing stars. \n \nCalm house, homemade broccoli beef, Jake's aide on time and helpful, the wind has finally died down. Things were going so smoothly I was able to sort and file papers. \n \nThen after dinner and a nice warm shower, Jake's voice just exploded through the house, from silent to AC/DC -Highway-to-Hell  loud. Yelling! Yelling! And he was crying that high-pitched cry that ends in an almost-sob. And he was running around the upstairs and throwing himself to the ground, dropping on his knees so hard I could hear the arthritis he will have later in life. \n \nHis arms were out-stretched, and too wide for the hallway, his hands bumping into bookcases and backpacks, and his gait was manic. He needed every inch of space we had, and then some. It was like he wanted out of his own skin.  \n \nLucy came over to me and said, \"I know this must make your heart ache Momma, because one of your babies is so sad. My poor brother, he must really hurt. He's so sad.\" \n \nSo, so very sad. I haven't seen him this upset now that he is this big. A three-year old dropping to the ground is very different from a 5'1\" tween hitting the hardwood floor with his whole body. \n \nHe ran down the stairs, past the aide who has seen this before, but probably not to this extent. I could hear his feet sliding across the rise and run of the staircase, and I willed him not to fall into a broken heap at the bottom. I prayed he would not be there crumpled on that tile that I hate so much. \n \nI got him to his room, and he jumped on the bed, and ran and hit the walls, and hit his head with his hands, hard, so hard that his temple was pink. My sad boy. \n \nI asked him to slow down, to let me think about what the problem could be that had come on so quickly.  \n \nHe stayed still a moment, waiting. \n \n\"Do you want medicine for your head?\" \n \nHe leapt out of bed and clapped his hands together, still yelling, but it really seemed like he was clapping in approval. This acknowledgement starts out like that first slow clap in an audience, when they just aren't sure of what they've seen, or heard, or if the moment is too reverent or wrong to disturb, and then it is faster, and insistent. He clapped his hands at me and ran to his bed covering himself with his comforter, then hopping up to get another drink of water from the cup that\u00a0 he had spied on his dresser. \n \nI went to the cabinet and got a Maxalt, a migraine drug that is fast-acting, and melts in your mouth. Back down the stairs I opened the little air-tight package in front of him, and seeing what it was, he opened his mouth to take it. Another sip of water and he turned from me. \n \nAnd then I got sort of lost for a moment.\u00a0  \n \nAll I could see were stars. Stars flying and dipping in front of my eyes, shooting across my field of vision like a sparkler that is too close. \n \nI am thankful that there was still another adult in the house in case I was the next person to have a crisis. I was also glad that I purchased a blood pressure cuff years ago when I was pregnant with Jake; I was such a worried mom back then. \n \nI went upstairs and checked my blood pressure and my systolic (the top number) had jumped by 25 over the highest number I can remember ever having, and the lower number, the diastolic, was up 20.\u00a0 My pulse rate was high, not burn-balories high, but high. \n \nTwelve minutes after Jake took the medicine he his splayed out on his bed with his head shielded from the last light of the day, by a mile-high pile of pillows and blankets. He stills \n \nLucy and I just made a last check in on him, because quiet can also make a Mommy scared. He is safe, and almost asleep. \n \nMy blood pressure is almost back to normal, my heart rate has dropped. The aide has gone home, with assurances that if I need to call her in the middle of the night, I can. Lucy is coloring, happy that her brother feels better. Jake sleeps. \n \nNight has fallen, the house is quiet, and out the window, there are stars. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r7bqxZ8a3ds/UW9l5bIG32I/AAAAAAAAQPA/h-8-4eoJtMc/s1600/free_vector_wallpaper_star.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2013/04/written-in-stars.html", "title": "\nWritten In The Stars\n"},
{"date": "15 August, 2013", "body": "\nMost writers I know crave a space of their own where they can think, doodle, and hopefully-write. I have an entire  Pinterest board devoted to retreat-type spaces  that given more time, space and money I would create and use to nurture my soul and encourage my craft. I imagine a life where there are outlets on every wall, and at least four places to sit or lounge, so one could read or rest or write. \n \nIt will be a quiet space, except for the sound of rain on the roof, which will never be louder than inspirational patter. It will be cozy, with natural light, and bold colors, or not, and blue walls, or yellow, or white-washed old pine. There will be alfresco dining and writing, and the sounds of birds or perhaps the city. It will be a beautiful space that is just barely big enough to invite someone else in, with room for everyone on the patio. It will be glorious. \n \nOr, what really happened, after years of quaint cafes in Berkeley and surrounding environs, museum spaces in San Francisco, then later, my dining room table... I find myself, in a Starbucks cafe inside of a Target. \n \nI thought it would go the other way, that the more I called myself a writer, the more likely my environment would look like a writer's life was supposed to look. I only started saying I was a writer when my daughter introduced me as one to her kindergarten teacher. It gave me the legitimacy that I had been waiting for, so I am going with it, but what about my retreat?\u00a0 Where is my awesome chair and the corner couch? \n \n \nApparently on aisle 5...just over there, past the underwear and the back-to-school section.  \n \nIs it a fall from grace, or me recognizing that I do not need as many props as I used to? The coffee is hot, and the wi-fi is free. I'll take it. \n \nIn college I wore the uniform, black, and black. I had journals and fancy pens. I carried a leather mail bag that was so heavy it makes carrying a sleeping child seem like a breeze. I brooded appropriately. I drank black coffee. \n \nI looked over some of my writing just yesterday and was pleased to see that not all of it was drivel, but some of the events that weighed down my being, while not frivolous, were certainly not the forever heartbreak I thought they'd be. I didn't even know what I didn't know.  \n \nSome of what I read triggered nostalgia, remembering the carefree time spent out dancing with friends until the bar closed, and smoking on rooftops with no railings, three stories up, in the fog of the Marina. Some of it triggered the feelings of lonely I had, even as I was surrounded by people who cared about me. \n \nI was thrilled to find pieces of my husband, as background, then more, as we went from friends to marriage. I laughed at a crush or two I had forgotten. \n \nI missed my little apartment with the tiny room that was barely attached to the house on Dana Street. I missed my friends who have scattered around the globe, and my little vase I filled with flowers every Friday as a treat to myself. \n \nI missed writing every single night, aware that anything I forgot to put to paper would be lost to time. I wrote with passion, about passion. I wrote about the mundane, and the dramatic, and there was poetry, and lists of character names. I wrote, and wrote and wrote.  \n \nThe time I am in is always the best one when I look back. Even if it was ugly, it was the best because I survived or endured something and came out the other side. And of course there are all the moments that enlightened and surprised me, those were the best too.  \n \nBut I just know  these  are the best of times, with happy, healthy children and husband, and our great friends, and lovely adventures. I need to take care to remember these days. \n \nSo this wobbly Big-Box store cafe table will suffice. I don't need a specific space in which to write--I just need to make \nmore space in my head so the words can attach to each other in \nmeaningful ways, and then I need to write them out. I don't want to lose this section of our jumbled, messy, lovely,\n happy, frantic life over a throw pillow and a tin roof.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://pinterest.com/jennyalice/retreat/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l9x5cif9zlI/Ug0SHFkjc4I/AAAAAAAASmk/3A3I-REWV28/s1600/targetsbucks.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2013/08/clean-up-aisle-five.html", "title": "\nClean Up!

We have received wonderful reviews so far, especially from Steve Silberman who has called Thinking Person's Guide to Autism the  Book of the Year.  He says ... \n \n...my favorite book of the year on autism was curated and self-published by\n a group of parent-warriors with the express purpose of sparing other \nparents the grief, isolation, and confusion that followed their own \nkids\u2019 diagnoses. Called the  Thinking Person's Guide to Autism ,  it\n offers helpful, positive, pragmatic, evidence-based advice for making \nthe life of your kid and your family more rewarding and more joyful, \nstarting today. I can\u2019t think of a better holiday gift for someone with a\n loved one on the spectrum. With current estimates of autism prevalence \nrunning at 1 in 110 people in the US, the book deserves a wide \nreadership.  \n \n (I hope you read the rest of his article...Leo's cuteness is featured quite prominently!) \n \nThis book has been an honor to be a part of, and I can only hope that there's a story, a chapter, or even one line that helps another person navigate this life a little easier. There was nothing like this book when Jack was diagnosed more than seven years ago. I didn't know which information to trust. I didn't even know any adults with diagnosed autism. The website, the online relationships and all of the great content just amazes me. \n \nAnd I have learned and grown over the last year and a half. My mind has been changed, while I have also become more confident in my own story.\u00a0 I have a better understanding of community, and I am learning what advocacy looks like, or should look like. My heart has softened, just as my resolve has become a bit more steely. My heart holds so many more people and all of their words.  \n \nI have always said I am a different woman, a better woman than I would have been for knowing my son. I know that I would have been a writer or an editor of something somewhere. I probably would have donated my time and skills to help others because I was raised to think that is important. But I recognize that I am only a part of this great project because of my son. All of his struggles and triumphs, and the future that lies before him in this great big world filled with malice and grace. He led me to this opportunity, and I hope he is proud of the work we have done.  \n \n \n \n \n Buy your copy today! \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2011/12/19/book-of-the-year-thinking-persons-guide-to-autism/", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0692010556/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwmyersr-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0692010556", "http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2011/12/19/book-of-the-year-thinking-persons-guide-to-autism/", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0692010556/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwmyersr-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0692010556"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/12/fit-to-print.html", "title": "\nFit to Print\n"},

The ones we went to when I was pregnant with Jake, and\na sob lifted up through my gut and caught me by surprise by gasping out so\nsharply it was like a gunshot in the distance. \n \n \n \nI wasn\u2019t sad, exactly, or happy, or nostalgic, just jolted\nby how very much I have learned since those classes finished; what a different\nwoman I am.  \n \n \n \nWe were late for every single one of them, every single\nclass. We thought we were too good for them, I remember that now. I thought we knew\nmore, and were smarter than every other couple in that class, before we even walked\nin the door. The nonchalant arrogance of youth and privilege, health and\nprosperity, kept my feet several inches off the floor, even as we were good kids who held doors\nopen for others, and made plans to take our future children on world\ntours, so they could truly understand how blessed we are. I was not ungrateful\nor unkind, just unwearied, and undereducated by life. I didn\u2019t know how much I\ndidn\u2019t know. \n \n \n \nI remember that I liked that we were joining a new club. With\nthe addition of  \u00a0 \u201cparent\u201d to \ncollege graduate,\nmarried, and employed, we were bound to just add to our parents\u2019 pride \nin us.\nWe bought a home and stripped the heinous paper off the bathroom walls. \nWe had so much. We were almost done setting up everything to play out\nthe perfect life.  \n \n \n \n \n \nBut I wish I could talk to that younger me, take her to\ncoffee and let her know just a few of the things that would be ahead. Our\npastor quoted Dante at our wedding \u201c Abandon hope all ye who enter here\u2026\u201d \nand, well actually, that\u2019s what I would give her, like a talisman: Hope. \n \n \n \nI would let her know that hope is not neurotic anticipation.\nHope and hard work will be the foundation of every day from that day forward,\nand without one, the other will be useless, so have them both. \n \n \n \nI would tell her that no amount of childhood can prepare you\nto be a proper adult, and our parents can\u2019t be blamed or praised for\neverything, because every day is a new chance to be better, or to make bad\nchoices all on our own. Who I am today is a result of my foundations, but more\na result of all of the choices I\u2019ve made since my parents stopped telling me\nwhat to do. So depending on the topic, I have been free to make my own choices\nabout some things since I was five, and others I have just learned to manage on my\nown.  \n \n \n \nI\u2019d\n remind her that there is no guide better than her own\nmoral compass, so don\u2019t get caught using someone else\u2019s directions. And \nwhen\nhearing the words of others, I\u2019d tell her to try to translate them to \ntheir best possible meaning, because most people don\u2019t mean harm, even \nwhen their words are\nsharp, and most of the vitriol she will hear won\u2019t really be aimed at \nher\ndirectly anyway. I\u2019d tell her to remember the kind words that people say\n to\nher, because replaying only the mean things will break her heart. And \nwhen things finally blow over, whatever they are, she should let go of \nbeing sad, because people who do mean to hurt you rarely come back to \ncheck on you.  \n \n \n \nI would tell her to sleep easier, and tell that voice in her\nhead to go ahead and think it through, and make a path, but not to lie awake each night\nbranching out every plan until tomorrow is so, so far in the past you are\nregretting your future before today has even played out. \u00a0  I would encourage her to enjoy each bite of\nlife, and when there is a pause, remind her to recall what it was like just\nbefore that biggest problem you have ever faced, appeared before you, because\nthat is life too, the sweet parts in between the hardships. And the truth is, there\nis more sweet in life than we think.\u00a0\n\n \n \n__ \n \n \n \nI pulled the car over to breathe properly,\u00a0 because I remembered the\nlightness, and remembered what I thought was hard then, before I had ever experienced\nall of the amazing twists of humanity I have seen since. And I realized that\ndriving past the building thirteen years later is one of my sweet moments\nbefore something else comes to our door, so I wanted to remember the feeling. I\nknow more than those people in that room now for sure, more than my younger\nself, but I know now how much more there is to learn. \n \n \n \nAs this New Year begins to unfold, I find myself grateful\nand humbled. \u00a0  I am aiming to live\njoyously and without apathy. I want to hear each person\u2019s best intentions, and\nhelp people hear the good in each other\u2019s words too.  I am full of hope, or I am\ntrying to be full of hope. I really want to start each day with a full cup, and\nif most of it spills out, then I will try again tomorrow, but at least I\u2019m\ngoing to try.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\u00a0*** \n \n \n \n \n because of course a Happy New Year post should include a giant quote about Hell. Dante Alighieri (1265-1321).\u00a0\u00a0The Divine Comedy.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Canto III I then, with horror yet encompast, cried: \n \n \u201cO master! what is this I hear? what race  \n \n Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?\u201d \n \n He thus to me: \u201cThis miserable fate  \n \n Suffer  the wretched souls of those, who lived \n \n Without or praise or blame , with that ill band  \n \n Of angels mix\u2019d, who nor rebellious proved, \n \n Nor yet were true to God,  but for themselves \n \n Were only . From his bounds Heaven drove them forth \n \n Not to impair his lustre; nor the depth  \n \n Of Hell receives them, lest the accursed tribe \n \n Should glory thence with exultation vain.\u201d   \n \n \u00a0I then: \u201cMaster! what doth aggrieve them thus, \n \n That they lament so loud?\u201d He straight replied:   \n \n \u201cThat will I tell thee briefly. These of death \n \n No hope may entertain: and their blind life   \n \n So meanly passes, that all other lots \n \n \u00a0They envy. Fame of them the world hath none, \n \n Nor suffers; Mercy and Justice scorn them both.   \n \n Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n TL;DR  \n do not live selfishly and  don't muddle through this world indifferent to good and evil;  there is no glory in a life of apathy. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rD2Dlz9G26w/UtWA9BG7_FI/AAAAAAAAUMU/X9wagxtLUyg/s1600/320px-Le_penseur_de_la_Porte_de_lEnfer_%28muse%CC%81e_Rodin%29_%284528252054%29.jpg", "http://www.bartleby.com/20/103.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2014/01/no-woe-here-its-happy-new-year.html", "title": "\nNo Woe Here.

The only constant in this world, and I think I might hate it. Oh I pretend to like it: time change, when we get to sleep in, or see the sunrise. I like to change the color of my hair. Really I just love a new haircut. I like to go on a road trip and get a change of scenery, or try a new cocktail at a new bar. But really, none of those things are very risky. Not at all. They have very little consequence. Even if I  bleach my hair out to Gwen Stefani white  I can get it back (or most of it, what hasn\u2019t fallen out) back to a normal-ish blonde color that doesn\u2019t make my mother gasp.  \n I like to joke that \u201capples don\u2019t fall far from the tree\u201d when it comes to Autism. Jake is such a combination of the people in my family, and I can see parts of his personality in each of us: his sense of humor, his lack of dexterity, his determination, his migraines, his struggle with communication, even if it is exaggerated in how he demonstrates the behavior, I can almost always get a glimpse of how Jake became Jake\u2026 including his need for things to be the same; and that he got from me.  \n This doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not flexible, I am, but I always have multiple threads going, so even if it looks like spontaneity, I am hopefully already prepared for that possibility. I feed the kids at the same time every day, even if it means we add in meals with other people at other times. Jake\u2019s body clock does not alter with season, or place, or time zone, so that means he eats 5-6 meals in Hawaii, and goes to bed with hours of sunlight left in the summer. He has worn the same brand of pants for three sizes now, and I have been known to buy the same shoe in two colors if I really like them, or two pairs, for when one of them eventually wears out beyond repair. \n I work hard to get things to a \u201csteady\u201d. It\u2019s not settling for anything, I just want to keep the boat afloat, with everyone on it, with provisions and direction. Not to go overboard (ha!) with the metaphor, but I don\u2019t even care sometimes if we have the sail up. I just need to know where we are headed and know that our crew is ready. We can float in one place, as long necessary, if we are together and (mostly) happy.  \n So Lucy is starting kindergarten in the fall, which means we need to decide now where we want her to go, and I am a wreck. Change. Again. Or maybe not. Or maybe. Aaaaghhh. \n When Jake went to kinder it was sort of a surprise. I thought he was going to stay one more year in his early intervention preschool. I thought I had time to ponder the choices, visit schools and determine which disability we would try to place, autism or CP. Instead I was sort of bombarded with \u201cUhm, Jake is really big (tall) and don\u2019t you think he should move on to kindergarten so he doesn\u2019t step on any little ones who are just entering preschool?\u201d and somehow I nodded believing that height had something to do with matriculation. \n \nThen I visited two classrooms and picked one. I made the wrong choice, or a bad choice, because I\u2019m not sure the other class would have been right, but I know where he went was wrong. I didn\u2019t ask the right questions, and when I took Jake for his first day I was greeted with aides who received no direction, and a new teacher, who spoke very broken English, as it was her very-distant-second language. The class had a mix of kids with such a wide variety of disability that there was no teaching. After the first month I learned that Jake spent most of the day in a Rifton chair buckled in, and rolled from table to table. I spent the first semester in conferences every week, and the second semester trying to find another placement. I felt like a horrible mother. We got him a new placement, and two years later, when he needed a different setting again, we found him Wunderskool. Now he is happy, and healthy and thriving, and as we settle-in to the back half of his second year there I am finally breathing. I had not felt steady since Jake was three.  \n My close IRL friends are probably, no, I  know  they are done with this conversation. I keep talking about where Lucy should go to school because, while I am generally a very decisive, opinionated, independent thinker, in this case, I want someone else to have the answer, tell me it\u2019s the right thing to do. I have at least one very close, trust-worthy friend at each possible location, so I can\u2019t even use the \u201cWho can care for my child if there is an earthquake and they need to take her for three weeks?\u201d Because, yes, tragically that is how scary my brain is\u2026 \n This has taken up all of my free-thought, and a lot of my previously-allocated-for-other-things thought too. I feel a bit silly being so upset by it all, but last time I did this I screwed up, and I certainly can\u2019t handle that feeling. And I\u2019m not having any more kids, so it\u2019s sort of the last chance I get to do this right.  And , most importantly, she is a neat kid, who is smart and funny and I don\u2019t want to send her to the wrong place.  \n I know what I want: I want same. I want no change. I want to put off for another year, or two, any sort of thinking about change, but I need to really think because there are options here, and financial impacts, and logistics to consider. \n So I have been on the tours. I have all the paperwork. I\u2019ve even asked the four-year old what she wants, because, you know, that's responsible parenting. She very capably decided that she could go to at least two schools if the hours were different, and then she put her hands over her eyes and said it was \u201cmuch too hard to decide.\" \n \nI agree.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jennyalice.blogspot.com/2009/04/i-cant-hear-you-my-hair-is-too-loud.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/01/its-only-kindergarten.html", "title": "\nIt's Only Kindergarten\n"},
{"date": "08 February, 2011", "body": "\nGrocery shopping this morning,\u00a0 a mom and her son passed by me in the floral department. She is probably in her 50's because her son looked about 10 years older than mine... and yes, her boy plays for our team: Autism. Right down to the 6 foot 2 inches of young man flapping his hands next to the strawberries and \"oooo--Wheeeeing\" in the dairy section. I could tell before the stims though, it's amazing how quickly I can spot a child with autism who's in the same part of the spectrum as Jake. \n \nWhen I see another family with a special needs child, I ALWAYS try to smile, at the child, or the parent, hopefully both, and even though I don't have a badge, a stamp on my forehead or my son with me to prove to her that I understand a little bit about her life, I always hope that a friendly smile will make her feel there is more good than ill-will in this world. I know there are days when I just hope that we can get through one single transaction without a struggle, and knowing that there are compassionate strangers nearby can make all the difference for me. But she wouldn't make eye contact with me, or anyone else for that matter, except her son. \n \nAnd while I thought it was precious that she spoke to him so clearly, looking directly into his face, in an undistracted and meaningful way, I also found it a little distressing to think that perhaps she has had to block the rest of us out. I felt compelled to go over to her, and make some benign comment about her shoes to initiate a conversation, just to make sure she knew that there are those of us out here, who would help if we could, and know a lot of resources, and could take the cart if things got a little hairy in the parking lot (even though her son was doing an awesome job), and ugh,\u00a0 I just wanted to take care of her...jeesh. Which then made me feel like a creepy stalker, because maybe she just isn't that social to begin with, but I think what I really wanted to know is this: will I become like her? and will Jake be like her son? \n \nWill I be so over other people staring at us by then that I will stop bothering to make eye contact? Will I look a little more resigned, but braver just the same. Will I look that tired, which is even more tired that I look now? Will my shoulders be that hunched? Will I look like I *really* need a break? \n \nand will my son be pushing the cart? Helping a bit, pausing for a little stim, then back to the cart, not running anyone over, not escaping? Will Jake still be with me, daily, when he's 20? 30? (and will he be that handsome?) \n \nJake wears a size 6 shoe already (that's an 8 woman's shoe in case you need a little frame of reference.) He is taller and stronger and more like a young man every day. It's getting harder to pretend that he is going to stay a little boy forever when you're shopping for shoes that big. And like so many parents, the future seems so far away right now. \n \n \n \n http://www.moore-warner.com/barns.php \n For awhile things were so hard I couldn't wait for Jake to get older, and grow out of whatever those troubles were. Then he got older and surprise! that age had its own pile of troubles. And certainly we experienced a lot of joy in there too, but it always seemed like a better version of our family was just around the corner. I am trying to be more aware, and happy with exactly where I am at any given time, and now that we've gained some stability (aside from some childcare dilemmas which are offline stories only), I've been been neither looking back or looking forward. We've just sort of been living, and enjoying, which I think is okay as long as I get back to that planning for the future thing, fairly soon. Sniff some flowers, but stay on the trail. And I want to make sure there's a plan for me too; maintaining my friendships, increasing the vegetable intake, getting more sleep.\u00a0 I don't really want to end up looking like that old red barn we pass on our way to the coast: confident, but beaten down, still in use but possibly not structurally sound anymore.  \n \nOf course I went to the grocery store without a shopping list and came home with 8 bags of groceries, and no plan for dinner, so perhaps I'll start with feeding my family before I move on to the rest of my life.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TVHgSamGdBI/AAAAAAAACuM/_mGMndiyqJk/s1600/barn.gif"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/02/old-red-barn.html", "title": "\nThe Old Red Barn\n"},
{"date": "03 January, 2011", "body": "\nIt's a new year. Shiny and bright and filled with promise, like a new school year, or a blank journal, or an empty center console in a family mini-van. \n \nI am already ahead as this year starts. If I accomplish very little else I will feel like I have had success because... \n \nI can make pancakes. \n \nNow this might seem like an easily overcome obstacle for most adults who can read, have even limited physical coordination and access to the necessary ingredients for cooking. This simple task has eluded me for all of my 38 years, but I have now successfully made beautiful, fluffy, properly cooked-through and most importantly, edible, pancakes four out of the last five days (I didn't have a fail one day, I just wasn't in charge of brekkie). I can now make breakfast for the troops swiftly and easily. I fed four kids Sunday morning before 7:30am and it was a breeze. I have now mastered breakfast.  \n \nIt's amazing how changing even the simplest things in life can make all the difference, to our confidence, or happiness. \n \nOn Christmas day we changed the time dinner was served. One hour earlier and Jake was able to enjoy the same, fancy, dressed-up, china, and three different wine glasses and four forks meal that everyone else had. He was able to stay the entire dinner, and finish three rounds of dessert before Descartes took him home. One hour earlier, and we had family dinner, with 14 people and Jake was able to be a part of the whole thing, and we all had a great time. Jake had a great time, because he loves being with his family. \n \nOur holidays were lovely. Changing a few simple things made each visit with each family go smoothly, even successfully. In fact, I can't actually think of any major drama, aside from our \"typical\" daughter throwing a no-nap induced fit on Christmas Eve, but she's four, and it's been documented, and when she's a mommy we will pull out this photo, and remind her of all of her drama and cuteness. \n \nThe trip to Southern California for Christmas was one of the most successful we have had in years. We felt taken care of, accepted, welcomed and for the first time in a long time, I think we could have stayed a few more days. My family is filled with loving, kind people, really. I'm not even writing that just because they read this blog (Hi Mom!) They really are wonderful people, and we have had visits go okay before, but Jake is a different boy now. He's matured so much in the past two years, and it makes travel and visits much easier. He is calmer overall, and if he does get upset, he's able to calm down faster once his needs are met. And of course, we have grown up too. I worry less about what other people think, and more about how to take care of my family. I also focus more on  my  family, rather than my family of origin. It's hard not to fall back in to family systems when you go home, but I know that if I take care of Descartes, Jake and Lucy first, it will work out for everyone. \n \nIt really went so smoothly. My mother had everything ready to go at her house. We had the right milk, snacks and help each morning with breakfast. Our beds were all set up and the kid toys were available. And guess what my mom bought? A bin filled with smooth rocks and little army guys and small (plastic) sea creatures; Jake had his very own sensory box. It was easy for her to get done (with the help of my sister-in-law, Pinky) and the kindest gesture. Such a small thing that Jake loved, and shows just how hard every one is trying to make sure that we get to be a part of things. \n \nChristmas eve we went to my brother's new house. It is in a very cute neighborhood, that reminds me a little bit of Toon Town at Disneyland, but it is a house filled with toys and non-breakable joy. Aside from Jake cracking off the manifold \n in my brother's backyard, it was an easy, fun, family dinner.\u00a0 The backyard was all set, and available for him to play in, for hours. We just moved one piece of furniture to block off some mud, and when it came time for Jake to turn in, he was able to sleep in his little cousin's pretty pink princess room, snuggled into all of those cozy rosy-hued pillows. Keeping doors closed, and breakables off the side of the table where our long-arm Larry walks through the kitchen, I didn't even have to make those requests because they know my kid now. Even the what-we-thought-was-major-but-turned-out-not-to-be-so-bad, plumbing issue was made to be no big deal, and certainly no one was angry with Jake.\u00a0 We have a running joke in the family to guess who's going to ruin Christmas each year. One year my brother Gerard asked for the receipts to all of his gifts so he could return them and get what he \"really wanted.\" Another year, my youngest brother Albert threw a little fit about how we \"don't even know him\" because we guessed the wrong size sweater for him, and I sort of tried to top that ruin by being upset that Descartes had not proposed to me (he proposed the next day). My sister fell into the Christmas tree one year, and missed another year entirely. So Jake  tried  to ruin Christmas this year, but we found the sprinkler shut-off so I'm not sure he can claim the title.  \n \n Christmas day with the other part of my family, has been troublesome for us in the past. The mix of Jake with china, glassware, and expectations led to many of us being sad. My parents have valiantly tried so many different ways to accomodate us, and this year was no exception. Their perseverance has paid off; this year it was fantastic. This was the dinner we moved one hour earlier. The other thing they did was to get a private room for our large party, which was perfect. This way the house was not \"set-up\" and breakable by Jake, and the mess of dinner was taken care of by a very nice waitstaff. The private room gave us some breathing space, and the patio we could access meant that we could take breaks between courses. The little kids got to wiggle and dance and we all laughed and enjoyed the very, very delicious food. It was such a luxury, and I am so grateful. \n \nOur drive back to the SF Peninsula was easy. We left before anyone was too grumpy, packed food in the car, and were able to avoid drive-thru food for the duration. We stopped for dinner before we got home to avoid that horrible let-down of post vacation combined with an empty fridge. Then we washed some clothes and packed the car again and went to Tahoe for the week and New Year. \n \n \n \n The gloves are 80's rocker-girl, but they are on! \n \n \n What a fantastic week we had there! Beautiful snow, perfect accommodations, doting grandparents and little children who got along. I got to sneak out with the girls, and spend time chatting and sipping while gazing out at the icy lake, and later in the week, I went snowshoeing. The guys went ice fishing, and we all played in the snow. \nJake wore a hat and gloves. Jake wore gloves, and a hat! And he kept them on. Whooooooooo Hoooooooo! This is the first year he has ever kept them on. We cheered and laughed and he smiled, and all the little kids congratulated him! Perhaps it was the 20 degrees outside, or the fact that they've been working with hats at Wunderskool, or maybe Jake is growing up, and recognizes that he can tolerate some things for short periods of time. I know he heard us say that he would have to go back inside if he wouldn't wear gloves...and that boy loves to be outdoors.  My sister  got some great photos, and while he's not smiling in this one, he really did have a great time, which means we all got to have a good time. \n \nWe're back at home now, and I have almost finished unpacking. Jake had school on Monday, and Lucy goes back tomorrow. It's been a whirlwind couple of weeks filled with little things that have made all the difference: pancakes, room to breathe, gloves.  \n \nWhat a great way to start the year, grateful for these small things. I must remember that nothing in our life is static; there is room to grow and change, and even the smallest of changes can transform our family. \n \njust in case you need a little bit of Happy Change, here's the recipe for those pancakes: \n \n Favorite Mountain House Pancakes \nsift together: \n1 1/4 cups flour \n2 tablespoons of table sugar \n2 teaspoons of baking powder \n1/4 tsp salt \n \nadd to: \n1 egg, beaten with 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and 1 cup of milk \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TSH31anpccI/AAAAAAAACso/90rQYyCodVU/s1600/katecries.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TSCrVCTfYaI/AAAAAAAACsg/jX1lz-X2ZbU/s1600/manifold.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TSCr3_vFByI/AAAAAAAACsk/XlXwEGrrxdM/s1600/plumber.png", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TSK6t4WP5JI/AAAAAAAACsw/RUnOK_C3ZcQ/s1600/kateandem.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TSK6U3zAW7I/AAAAAAAACss/TTtnXSh_cR8/s1600/jakeand+gloves.jpg", "http://www.mandymartynimages.com/"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/01/fluffy-pancakes-and-other-holiday.html", "title": "\nFluffy Pancakes and Other Holiday Miracles\n"},
{"date": "10 November, 2010", "body": "\nI've been working on a post for  The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism  on why we chose to give Jake medication to address his ADHD symptoms, and how to go about it if you think your child might benefit.  \n \nThe thing is, as I keep working on the post, and I've been opening it and writing, deleting, and writing again, every day for over a month, I find that it is really not my best work. The language is stilted. There is no flow. I can't seem to get the words out, or clarify my message. \n \nLast night was a restless one for Descartes and I. I could tell at about 4:30am that neither of us was sleeping. But just in case I was wrong, I let the silence surround us, as I am NOT wont to do. Silence is so heavy for me. It forces me to think for myself, instead of bouncing my ideas off of other people, gauging their reactions. It forces me to be my own company, which makes me think about what I like and do NOT like about myself...and then how I want to change those things, which inevitably leads me to thinking about how I need to do more for my family, for my friends, for my work. I form to-do lists at 5am that I will accomplish TO-DAY! for the projects I dedicate my mind to.  \n \nSo this morning in the darkness I tried to work through what was bothering me about writing what would appear to be a simple post about the medications I give my son, why we do it, and how to do it. I think I am worried about the judgment. People, myself  included, are so quick to judge others. It's how we determine friend or foe, helpful or harried. We make snap decisions about people all the time. If we have grace, or empathy, or something other than outright narcissism, we might consider why another person is behaving in a certain manner, and hold our harshest judgments, or our condemnation, but sometimes we just judge and move on. \n \nPeople, individuals I know, and talk show pundits, and magazines and teachers have judged my family and our choice to give Jake medication, and it is painful to think that others might view me as the type of parent who would cause my child harm. What's worse is that I judge myself. I know we've made the right decisions.. I know that we have, but a part of me questions the ethics of giving a non-verbal 10 year old medications, which alters his mood. He can't tell me when he has cotton mouth. He can't tell me if it is making him feel anxious, or if he's not eating because the medications remove his appetite, or he ate a big snack at school. And I have found myself thinking that many children are mis- or over- diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, when all they really need is some more stimulating way of teaching to keep their attention focused on learning.. or maybe they just need to have P.E. in school again to run some energy off some of those antsy legs. \n \nBut I don't want to share that part with parents who are trying to figure out if pharmacological intervention might help their child. I only want to tell them the good parts, about my son's overnight ability to sit in a chair, or go to brunch with his grandparents again. The way he can make it through a five hour flight to Hawaii, and dinner. I want parents to be unaware of those harsh judgments, so they can get to the point of helping their children, because in spite of those naysayers who tell us we have made up ADHD, some children will benefit from medications like this.  \n \n The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism  is filled with fact-based information. Science. Truth. Honesty. It is already helping families and has opened communication with adults on the spectrum. I know that an honest account, of all my emotions, will be the post that reaches the most people. I just want to balance all of that negative- the negative in my own mind, and all of those harsh words around us, with all of the possible benefits, and somehow write all of it down, without being judged. \n \nor, as I have often done in my every day, going-to-get-through-this way, I suppose I could just do what I need to do and let the critics say what they must before they move on... because they do eventually move on, and what always remains is the best decision I can make for my family at the time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thinkingautismguide.com/", "http://thinkingautismguide.com/"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/11/is-there-pill-for-this.html", "title": "\nIs There a Pill for This?\n"},

{"date": "13 July, 2010", "body": "\n Four years ago we were sitting in a hospital room. That's Jake on the floor trying to feel the cool of the hospital floor, and that's Lucy, nursing, and that's me, tired, scared, and trying to smile, knowing that these were the baby photos Lucy would see someday. \n \nLucy was 4 weeks old and Jake had\u00a0  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). \n \nThe only isolation room they could find for us was at a hospital in a town 25 minutes away. We didn't know any of the doctors at this hospital, though the doctor who cared for Jake was in residency with our regular doctor. We had never been to this hospital before we checked in, and were immediately escorted to a room across from the nurses station. They placed us in a wing where pediatric patients who needed constant monitoring, but were not ICU, were housed. Because we were so contagious, and they assumed we all were carriers, we were not allowed out of our room except to leave the hospital directly, without stopping. We couldn't even get our own coffee from the room across the hall. We were not allowed in the cafeteria. People gowned and masked before they entered our room, speaking to us dressed as yellow papery ghosts, and I had a newborn. Jake had a wound that grew so fast, and had such a hard time going away that they drew a line around it in black permanent marker so we would know how we were progressing or not. Descartes slept on a tiny little fold out cushion chair for three, or was it four, nights in a row, while I drove back to our house each night with our tiny baby girl. It was horrible, and because of the wound placement, we were all fearful that it would get into his hip bone. \n \nI have never been someone who is scared of people in the medical profession. I am not afraid of blood, or guts or gore. It takes a lot to make me queasy, and I always want to know why. My whole life I have wanted to know why, and figure out a way to fix things. I have tremendous respect for the medical profession, but I have figured out that I actually am as smart as some of those people, I just chose a different path, and this hubris served me well when Jake was covered in horrible wounds that would not heal. I was also so very lucky to have a doctor in the practice who knows us, outside of the office as well, and she knows I am not a sissy mom who brings my child in for the sniffles. When I took Jake to her that day, on only day three of the second round of heavy duty antibiotics, she trusted me when I told her it was getting worse, not better, and that the drugs were not working. I had been watching those red patches, counting them, and I knew. She trusted me, and she made the calls and found us a bed a 6pm on a Friday. Under normal circumstances she is a great doctor, in a crisis, she is an amazing doctor.. (and I will have to ask if I can link to her before I actually do. Can you please ask her if I can M.D.? I know you read this;) ) \n \nAfter we checked in, got Jake settled into some regulation jammies made of some crazy non-flammable material, a doctor came in to see us. She was kind, and greeted us with the proper amount of decorum and an air that let us know she was in charge, because of course she was in charge. Then she told me that Jake would need to have seriously heavy-duty, one-step-down from military grade antibiotics. Fine. Of course. And then she said he would need to have an I.V. for 40 minutes every two and a half hours. \n \nOh dear. \n \nThis post-partum mommy went nuts. I was holding Lucy, possibly nursing her, and I know I raised my voice. I'm sure of it... and I said something like, \n \n\"ARE YOU KIDDING ME? HAVE YOU EVER HAD A PATIENT WITH AUTISM IN YOUR HISTORY IN THE MEDICAL FIELD?\" \n \nand I continued... \n \n\"WE NEED TO KNOCK THIS KID OUT TO BRUSH HIS TEETH, AND YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO GET HIM TO SIT STILL WITH A NEEDLE IN HIS ARM FOR 45 MINUTES EVERY 2 1/2 HOURS?\" \n \nShe looked a little bit, uhm, surprised, and hurt, and stunned, and miffed. \n \nI said, \"YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO GET CREATIVE HERE. GO FIGURE IT OUT!\" \n \nand she walked out of the room. \n \nMy precious husband said, in the nicest way, and with only a little bit of fear that I might have a knife and be okay with using it... \"Honey, that's the person who is going to be responsible for helping our son get better, perhaps you could go a little easier on her?\" \n \nA few, not many, but a few minutes passed, and the same doctor came back in...with a book in her hand, open to a page three quarters of the way in. \n \n\"What about a shot of the same drug every hour and half? A muscular injection. And we could put it closer to the site of the wound?\" \n \nAnd I clapped my hands for her and gave her every amount of praise I could muster. WHOO HOOO! \n \nOf course I then had to convince the nurse, and the next doctor, when our first very smart, creative doctor had to leave, that we should only put the shots into one side of his body, the side with the big wounds. They said it would be too painful, and I while I understood that, I had thought this one through. I explained that my son only had one side he could still rest on, only one side that did not have a 2+ inch nasty, open wound, and if they took that away he would never sleep. The doctor rolled his eyes at me...literally rolled his eyes, and the nurse, he said, \"Wow, I've never thought of that. So the patient can actually still rest comfortably, at least on one side.\" \n \nI nursed my baby and rocked her to sleep.  \n \nIt took 3 1/2 more days for the last wound to go down to a level  that we could leave the hospital. We watched that last wound slowly shrink from its black outline, reminding me of an atoll on a map. When it looked like we were headed towards health, they let us go home, but his treatment was not over for another week or so. We drove him back to the doctor for a few days after that, twice a day, so he could get additional injections. I think he was on antibiotics for nearly three months by the time he was finally healed. \n \nHe has only a tiny scar on one hip, so small now most people would never notice it, but whenever I see it I remember how scary it was, how deeply infected my poor boy was.  \n \n ********* \n This part is bragging: We have never had the MRSA come back. This is pretty rare, because it is really hard to shake. We put a bit of bleach into Jake's bath for nearly two years. We still do not reuse towels (on the kids). We have hospital hand pumps with anti-bacterial at the back door, and in several other places around the house. We swabbed our noses with a special ointment for months.

{"date": "28 February, 2010", "body": "\nSo apparently the world does keep turning, even when I am not on Twitter,  FaceBook  and every other form of social media on which my moniker aspires to perch. I lost some followers, but since I don't even like that word it doesn't bother me much. My family is on the mend too. February was a blur of illness and fever and snot, and for me it also included my  first  nebulizer , steroids and some heavy duty antibiotics. Sage reminded me that probably the best lesson I could possibly learn from being sick for 25 days is to learn how to ask for and accept help. This is a big one for me. When I ask for help I feel like I am failing, like I am letting everyone down, and I hate that feeling. I am grateful that my closest friends don't wait for me to ask them for help, and they jump in and shuttle my kids, cover my work, make me dinner, buy me groceries and call to check in on my feverish little self. I chose well, and I'm so glad they chose me back. What is interesting to me is that I love helping people. It pleases me when I can make someone  else's  life easier, so why can't I just accept help...especially in the beginning of a problem so it doesn't spiral out of control later? I think I actually know part of the answer...Jake. I feel like I am going to have so many BIG THINGS I need help with in life that I sort of don't want to use up all my chits asking someone to pick up two rolls of paper towels from the market for me. When Jake stepped on a three inch nail, I needed someone to take care of my daughter right there at that moment, and I had that in two minutes. I guess I don't ever want that feeling like \"Oh I just asked her to do this little thing and that thing, so I don't really want to ask again for this.\" Now I know I have close enough friends now, after being a part of both this special needs and the greater community, that I really could ask for just about anything and someone would help me. I know an amazing, powerful, get it done bunch of people, and yet I am loathe to ask for help. Even when someone is offering, and it's easy and they are already there, in the store, I feel like I am being lazy, or not self-sufficient. And even as I write this I sound like a ridiculous martyr. Yeah, I know.. get over it.  And I'm trying. I am. and I really want to thank my friends for taking care of me and feeding my family here, and thank you, dear sister,  for taking care of my sick husband and my  babyGirl  for those 3+ hellish days. Descartes could not have asked for a better nurse, and it is a darn good thing I sent those two to Tahoe, because I probably would be dead if I had tried to take care of Descartes that weekend too. *********************** This morning Descartes got up with \"all those children\".. I have not slept so soundly in a hundred million years, just 1.25 hours past when I would normally get up, and I felt so much better.  Sadly I think I get my best sleep between 5:30 and 7:30; these are also the hours when I have been nursing, or getting children ready for school for nearly 10 years. Oh my God ten years. *********************** We took a hike this afternoon, not a long one, but just long enough for me to realize that I didn't do much walking for the past month. Jake did such a great job. He walked the entire time without dropping to the ground once or trying to run away. He held Descartes' hand the entire time up and down some steep hills. We went about a mile round trip, which may not sound like a lot, but when you have a kid with cerebral palsy that you don't think will ever walk.. it is life changing for our family... and yes, Lucy hiked in a princess dress, and heart-covered tights and pink converse with multi-colored stars.

I had kind of forgotten that we were going to do this, which is better because I couldn't freak out about what we were going to wear (hmm? what DID I pack for the kids besides jeans with holes and dirty tennis shoes?)

{"date": "21 March, 2010", "body": "\n Eagle Marker.  I took this from my dad when I left for college. I found it on the dining room table under a stack of mail that looks so much like the stacks of mail I have now. I never understood how a person could have that much mail, or how you could lose a check made out to you, or how something might get sent in late or not at all. I could not imagine ever having such a complicated and messy life. My empathy has taken so long to develop. Pink eyeliner pencil  I took this from my mother's makeup drawer when I left for college. I'm fairly certain she didn't really use it, as I recall her wearing a smoky blue/black, but I also took a  Clinique  dry/wet eyeliner set too, just in case. My mother is beautiful and I always hoped I would grow up to be as pretty as she is. When I first tried makeup in 7 th  grade, the only comment she made was \"In a little while you will see that you are wearing way too much makeup and that you're much prettier with much less. Come to me when you want me to teach you how to put makeup on.\" Three days later I learned how to use a soft sea sponge to put on foundation... Gap pencil  This one is before they even changed the logo, so it must be from 1989 or 1990. I started working there in 1989 and didn't leave for 11 years. I met some of the most wonderful people and learned a lot about business, management, communications and how to make friends and influence people.. no seriously, I did. U.C. Berkeley ballpoint  I bought this pen when I went to  ASUC  for the first time as a student (that's pronounced  AY  SUCK for those of you who didn't go to Cal). I then went and bought a gazillion dollar Shakespeare anthology and realized I would not be able to afford another pen until 1994 at the earliest. I still have that anthology. The first flowers Descartes ever gave me are pressed in that book. We were just friends when he gave me those flowers, it was more than a year after that when we started dating, and they are the only flowers I have ever pressed in my life. Montblanc  (totally fake) I bought this for myself around Christmas my freshman year of college when I was a) feeling sorry for myself and feeling dramatic. or b) having a moment where I just knew that if I had the right pen I would be the best poet/storyteller/novelist on the planet. Probably a little bit of both. I have a small blue-papered journal somewhere that \"goes with\" this pen. I carried them both in a leather mail bag that weighed 20 pounds empty. I carried these items everywhere, and pulled them out to  furtively  scribble poems and essays while on BART, all over San Francisco, and back in Berkeley at one of my favorite people watching spots,  Cafe  Milano  or  Caffee   Strada . Posterman  pen  from my sorority days. That place was more polarized than the U.S. House of Representatives on Health Care Reform vote day. I was the song chair at one point, and made all sorts of posters with the words of \u039a\u0391\u0398   songs on them. That pen smells so much that I nearly passed out while making those posters, even in my most beautiful \"fishbowl\" room (I shared with an older girl who was in an  a Capella singing group  with me. She had more 'points' so we had an awesome room). Waterman pen  (with my maiden name engraved on it) I worked so hard for this pen. I was in the Internship program at Gap. It was fairly new, like perhaps I was the second or third year that it existed? Basically if you followed all of the rules, learned all your stuff, performed magic tricks and smiled all the time,  you would graduate college and become an Associate Manager. As a graduation gift our Regional Manager gave us each a pen with our name on it. I always liked that regional manager, even when others didn't, which is kind of odd considering she was very tough, super exacting and had expectations for us that were above and beyond what was expected for our level. When I graduated I was an Associate Manager for three weeks before I got my own store. It was not a prestigious store, but my District Manager told me flat out, \" jennyalice , sometimes you gotta take one for the team.\" So I did, and I learned a LOT, mostly about myself. Google pen  I stole this one from Descartes. (It seems I am thief when it comes to pens?). It used to have a cool light in it with red, blue, yellow and green (Google logo colors), but it must have burned out some time in the last 10+ years I've had it. Perhaps it was the first piece of Dot.com swag in our house? It reminds me of my Life With Endless Possibility that was  before . It helps me remember things like Big Promotions, being newlyweds, and drinking late into the night on the evening  Inktomi  went public. CMD pen  I briefly worked at CMD after I left Gap. There were some very talented people there, but I never really fit in with the company personality. They are a Portland based company, and it was the height of Dot.com-everything-moves-very-very-quickly. I could never figure out why I was so frustrated until Descartes described Portland once after driving around for six hours waiting for me to finish my once-a-month meeting in the home office. I asked him how his day had gone and he said, \"I feel like a tiger in a cage full of bunnies.\" Waterman pen  Descartes  bought me this pen the first year we were married, for my birthday. I was so surprised and happy that he would know exactly what I would want... I also couldn't find my Gap pen at the time...I remember that the blue Waterman box was actually wrapped and had a bow on it. He took it out of his  Cabella's  mail bag, the green canvas one with the brown leather accents. That was back when his bag was really just his bag, and he wouldn't have dreamed of ever needing to get something out of my purse. We still had parts of us that were completely,  completely,  separate. It also reminds me that we used to actually buy presents for each other. I mean buy presents for each other that the recipient didn't know about until that person  unwrapped  the gift. Sadly, as good as my memory is, I cannot remember the last time I received a wrapped gift, and I know I have not wrapped a damn thing for Descartes in years, except perhaps a sandwich in some plastic. There were other pens and pencils in the ratty zip top bag, including colored pencils which Lucy needed for her art project this morning. Grabbing for those pink and silver wooden sticks, her hands pushed past these little flashes, these pieces, past my very own  tranche  de  vie  narrative .  I was sort of stopped there in each of those moments, thinking, then listening to the little voice in my head, \"Oh my God,  jennyalice . You really need to clean out that desk drawer more often.\" \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S6ZP2QhYK-I/AAAAAAAACWo/JQriZdKZxCY/s1600-h/lifepencilbox.jpg", "http://overtones.berkeley.edu/"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/03/my-life-in-pencil-box.html", "title": "\nMy Life in a Pencil Box\n"},
{"date": "31 January, 2010", "body": "\nMy sister rocks. I have an awesome husband... and in case you were wondering, I also have some very f un  and lovely friends. I actually was surprised on Friday night. Now I don't want to be cynical or anything, but I am not surprised very often, not by bad behavior, people who steal my wallet, traffic, weather changes, or  poopy  diapers as we are walking out the door. I have learned to anticipate almost every single one of life's little disasters because they all happen to our family, every single time they can. So, you know, I am not surprised. I am however, completely taken off guard when people a) like me b) do nice things for me without me being in complete crisis c) take care of me without me knowing what is going to happen next. My sister  Demanda  managed to gather up some of my favorite women, and make a plan to go out on Friday night they all kept the secret! We picked them all up on Friday night in our  AdventureVan  and went to three of my favorite places.. all to celebrate my birthday! I was supposed to have  Demanda  and  Jaster  and her boys for the night because I thought they were headed down to the  OC  and stopping on their way through. When she got here I kept asking her, probably more than 5 times if she was kidding; if perhaps there weren't actually three boys hidden in her suitcase or something. But no! She came all on her own, and said she had a surprise for me.. and [gasp!] I should go take a shower and look beautiful. I started to cry because I feel like I plan every single thing ever, and here was something fun that was going to happen and I was not responsible! I had already had a day filled with snotty noses and  crying children and earaches and trying to work while my precious little Lucy climbs all over me and reminds me that I never play with her because I am always working. It had really been a fun day. Then Descartes came home from work  early ,  with champagne , my favorite thing in the world besides my family and friends. He popped the cork, poured me a glass and I ran downstairs and got gussied up. I even put on my new boots. I know they are so ridiculous aren't they? I love them. I had already secured a babysitter, thinking that we would just go to dinner downtown with my sister. The three of us scooted on down to  Savvy Cellar  where we devoured some  charcuterie   and some [more] champagne. Then zipped back up the hill to get the first gal on the list.  Yay ! Sage  was waiting in h er front window, and I immediately understood why she had tried to convince me earlier in the day to stop cleaning up for my sister and take a nap. Next,  we went around the bend and picked up  Strecks , which is really lovely, since she's a new friend to me this year. Her daughter was the very first person Lucy played with on the very first day of preschool. Those girls are total  BFFs  and I think  Strecks  is very cool. She's also a good liar because she asked if I wanted to go to Bingo night, when she knew that we would both be drinking up delicious wines instead. Then we went all the way up the next hill, because apparently everyone I am friends with or related to lives off the side of a hill or a mountain... and picked up  Squid  and  Jenijen . Squid of course is also a sweet deceiver because she tried to make all of these elaborate plans to maybe meet up for a drink, but you know \"maybe she wouldn't see me\" because she and  Jenijen  were going to be seeing Avatar (and here is where I stopped and spent about 20 minutes trying to turn a beautiful picture of Squid into an Avatar.  Here is a tutorial  if you are thinking about it yourself. I am not that cool, nor do I have that kind of time.) We also scooped up  Pollyanna  (from up on her hill) who brought along with her a  horrid  cool birthday sash for me to wear. It read \"Birthday Princess, and I was \"required\" to keep it on until I finished my first beer. There was a sparkly wand too!  MaryMoore  met us at the bar (she had driven from her hill too..  jeesh  I am serious.. everyone lives on a hill). We took over a few tables outside at  The Refuge , one of my favorite places to go.  Jaster ,  Demanda , Squid, Seymour, Descartes and I have all put a dent in this place before both together and separately, so it was sad that  Jaster  couldn't be there because hey... Seymour joined us too! We were kind of crunched into the table, so much that I couldn't even get up to kiss anyone goodbye (sorry Seymour), but it was a nice kind of cozy, and the beer is just so good. They no longer carry my favorite  Allagash   Curieux  so I had to switch to a new one  Koningshoeven   Quadrupel , which was also heavy and delicious. We had all sorts of ales and eats. It was lovely and lively and there were cupcakes from  Va nilla  Moon  which were really decadent and  with so many flavors to choose from, made me feel like I was tasting wedding cakes all over again. We wrapped it up and headed down the street to Cask. We lost Seymour and  MaryMoore , but settled down with some red, white and champagne. It wasn't very crowded so we got a real chance to talk and laugh, and take a few photos. We closed the place, and our trusty driver, Descartes shipped our tired bodies around town, dropping ladies off on doorsteps. It really was a lovely evening with great people and wonderful food and drink. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (All pictures by  jenijen , unless she was in it, in which case I probably took it. There are more pictures coming...)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S2X5PGczfGI/AAAAAAAACT4/vo8KJXhSUuA/s1600-h/cake.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S2X2JfAHMfI/AAAAAAAACTw/VXkVywDQw_c/s1600-h/shoes_iaec1136834.jpg", "http://www.savvycellar.com/", "http://the-mama.blogspot.com/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S2kKla2iTxI/AAAAAAAACUY/TI4NHM9e6Jw/s1600-h/IMG_4105.JPG", "http://strecks.com/cart/", "http://squidalicious.com/", "http://not-calm.com/", "http://forum.learnnavi.org/fan-art/examining-the-proportional-differences-between-na%27vi-avatars-and-humans/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S2kJ0pEb77I/AAAAAAAACUQ/BQb8R4PhREo/s1600-h/IMG_4115.JPG", "http://blog.togetherville.com/company-info/", "http://www.refugesc.com/", "http://facetimewithgod.blogspot.com/", "http://www.allagash.com/curieux.htm", "http://just-grapes.blogspot.com/2008/02/koningshoeven-quadrupel-trappist-ale.html", "http://www.vanillamoonbakery.com/cupcake_flavors.html", "http://www.vanillamoonbakery.com/cupcake_flavors.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S2kLHFlC49I/AAAAAAAACUg/dNhRYMclIq8/s1600-h/IMG_4121.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S2h537d-xaI/AAAAAAAACUI/TPK8P8VaHFA/s1600-h/IMG_4089.JPG"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/01/surprise-seriously-yes-seriously.html", "title": "\nSurprise!

It is less black and blue in some places, and more in others. It is ugly.  Jake's precious teacher called me yesterday and suggested that since his Motrin had probably own off, perhaps I should pick him up from school...and so with Squid's two daughters already trapped in the car, we drove all the way to Wunderskool to get Jake. He was so happy to see Iz and Mali that I think he forgot about his nose for a bit. In fact, I swear I saw him blush when Iz said she liked his shirt later when we were in the car. After Mali convinced  a stranger &nbsp   her new best friend , Jake's teacher, to open the bathrooms so she could go, we all piled into the car and went to Lucy's school.

It was a herculean effort to get them all off the playground, but the promise of Dairy Queen had ALL of them clamoring to the gate and heading towards the car.

{"date": "10 December, 2013", "body": "\nIt's late. \n \nI've tried all the remedies to sleep, but my mind is so filled this time of year, it's hard to imagine it will slow down. \n \nInstead of sleepy,\u00a0 I fall in to nostalgia, which is possibly the worst category; it's worse than plain sadness or melancholy, or insomnia. I think nostalgia is a purgatory for people who have a solid sense of recall and an ability to\u00a0 include all of their senses when they remember. \n \nIt conjures up almost every place I've been-by smell, and vision, and emotion. The night is instantly filled with forty one years of life, instead of whatever became of this day. \n \nI certainly relive all of the most recent moments that have happened when my feet were a little cold, when Christmas was around the corner, or upon us, but more likely my mind wanders back to 8, and 12, 19, and 22, to when I was a bride-to be, and days of new-motherhood. \n \nI remember learning to ski with my \"Unka Danke\" (because that is what we called my mother's brother; we always had so many reasons to thank him). He pushed me down into the soft snow and taught me to get up on my own, then fed me soup from a thermos, and taught me how to open a beer. I never feared falling after that trip. Eight years old, and I mostly knew what you should always figure out: what is the the worst thing that can happen? Prepare for that, and everything else will be cake. Doomsday prepper in the making? Perhaps, but we have \"go bags\" for almost every part of our life. He gave me love and direction with no strings attached. His pragmatics dictated that he gave me distinct praise for my abilities and accomplishments- I always knew where I stood. I didn't know how rare his adjudication was until much later in life. And he treated me as an equal who just had yet to learn, never basing my identity on my age or gender. \n \nWhen I am sleepy, and there is a chill in the house, I can remember being asked by my parents to help with my brother's gigantic Lego gifts that were from \"Santa\" because my parents had lost the patience to complete whatever Millennium Falcon or aircraft carrier was laying about in thousands of pieces (or maybe they knew how much I loved Legos, even though they were never my gift?). I spent hours on those December 24ths putting together set after set, and I was always in charge of the stickers. \n \nI can remember that I slipped the neat bow off of the silver gift box (in the middle of the night) to see if my parents had purchased the right purse, so I would have the proper face of appropriate joy upon opening the gift, just in case they had gotten it wrong. I wanted to be disappointed alone so I wouldn't make them sad. (But they got it right!)  \n \nI remember lying, something I truly strive every single day not to do, to my parents for at least half of December one year, about who broke the foil-covered chocolate ornaments on the tree and ate part of each ball.\u00a0 I took the blame so my little brother would not get in trouble...as if my parents really cared. He ate so many of the chocolate balls that no one paid attention to all of the candy canes I pocketed each morning. \n \nOn this chilly night, I have a strong feeling, mixed with a\u00a0 solid haze about the years where I was still living with my parents, split between them since they had divorced. I remember the realization that I really had two sets of parents. There was a dinner when my not-yet-step sisters talked on about going skiing with friends and I wanted so badly to be a part of their world, yet unbeknownst to me, at my other house, I had a new ski jacket, boots and skis waiting for me under the tree. I was a pretty lucky kid.  \n \nThat was a year when I knew that things had broken, but not forever. I knew my brother and I would never suffer the ill fates that some of my friends had: angry, sad parents, changing schools. With so many parents who really loved us, how could we possibly fail? It's been confirmed in my head, after all of the stories I've heard, just how great we had it, how lucky all of my siblings from both sides are to have so many, many, parents who love them. I say now that I have six parents: the ones I came with, the ones I gained, and the ones I married into. We have that many people loving us, caring about our future, and our children's future. I've got extras looking out for me and the ones I love.  \n \nWhen it is this cold and\u00a0 I can't sleep, I can remember starting college, and there were so many new-to-me-religions. I was invited to go to Beverly Hills with my Jewish friends, and I craved the solid, persistent, unequivocal religion they experienced. They had family and religion and culture and education all tied-in-to-one thing. It made me understand Catholics better, and Buddhists, and Hindus, and Muslims. It made being a protestant seem bland, or undecided; I church hopped. I only knew I was not a Unitarian. \n \nI can remember, on a cold day like today sitting in the 1st Congregational Church in Berkeley, with my very kind boyfriend trying to figure out how to be a critical thinker and a Christian in one fell swoop, something he had perfected, an armor he wore without shame or arrogance. The church was clapboard and painted buttercup yellow inside, and the pews were smooth; the coffee was weak, but it was served with a smile. None of those things were a good fit for me, not the boy or the little yellow church. \n \nI can remember racing home for the holidays, the acrid smell of tobacco in the car as my best \nfreshman-year friend and I traveled down I-5. Thirty-eight degrees, windows open, pretending that cigarettes\n and 87 mph in a two door Toyota Corona couldn't shave a moment off our \nlives. My dad told me I should wait a bit to call him the next time I drove down, because he could do math, and knew that we never should have arrived that quickly. \n \nIn this sleeplessness, I feel the physical ache of working at the\n Big Blue Logo Box store I ran way back when, as the store manager. Looking at my watch (!) 4:45 \npm on December 24, knowing that it would take me an hour to get to the \nairport, and my flight left at 6:10 pm. I remember thinking that the only\n place to be for Christmas was somewhere in Orange County, where the sun\n is shining, the grass is green, the orange and palm trees sway. I can \nremember the joy of exiting the plane wearing the most awesome all-wool sweater skirt and jacket with a black bowler hat and the most \nprecious Mary Jane character shoes, with dark black tights, and realizing\n that upon disembarkation, I looked like someone heading to Annie Hall's\n funeral. \n \nThe cold, the not-sleepiness, makes me remember the nights I spent poring over books and charts trying to figure out who I would be, and the timeline it should follow. I thought my security, my future, my lifetime happiness, was most strongly knotted to marriage, which would bring me children, and a spouse, which would, in turn, garner praise from my parents. And I had hoped I would find satisfaction for myself, because for whatever shortcomings I have, I always thought my children will be better than I will ever be. I thought my awareness of my weaknesses would somehow give them strength. At the time, with all of my education and desire to succeed in the business world, I really thought I had only two tasks to get right: be married to good man, and be a good mom.  \n \nBut even now on this sleepless winter night, I can feel the anxiety of trying to be the right person, the right girlfriend. I can feel the needs-to-be written-about experience of my underwear, every piece of of lacy bit I couldn't afford, falling out of my suitcase and down the airport luggage carousal, a ten foot drop, waiting to be swept up into the arms, of what I thought at the time, was going to be my father-in-law. I can remember, as my nose chilled and my cheeks pinked to a hue unknown at makeup counters, thinking that perhaps, I had just become a story in some other family's life. \n \nNumbed hands and toes, I remember declaring my love for Descartes as snow fell around us, feeling warm in what what was surely a blizzard. I remember the longest drive home that day in the windy Jeep. \n \nI remember the cold fog at Fort Tejon on December 26th, 1996, when my now-husband, unwittingly admitted me into his life forever by asking me to marry him, and smell of the oranges we bought miles later at a roadside stand. I wore a yellow sweater that was donated last year by accident. The sky was so very blue that day. \n \nAnd I practically relive the nausea of being in a fold-out bed in my \nsister-law's house, suffering from the worst food poisoning. I lay dying in their front \nroom praying the world would end because my body was dissolving from the inside out, knowing that if I had not already been engaged, my groans alone would have heralded the end of my relationship. \n \n The cold reminds me of how warm my children's little bodies are when they crawl into my bed in the morning, making my bed a tumble of\u00a0 joy I didn't know could be so very big and heart-fulfilling. I think of Descartes' giant 'Lumber man' jacket that he purchased in the middle of August in Montana, making it the best off-season purchase ever. I think of ice fishing, calculating whether my child was bigger than the holes we cut in the ice. \n \nSo many memories, so little sleep.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y3C-7-eYtQg/Uqdp919YJ5I/AAAAAAAAT1g/eWLzTSnsK0w/s1600/2103_58642168616_6196_n.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2013/12/last-night-in-very-late-early-morning.html", "title": "\nLast Night in the Very Late Early Morning\n"},
{"date": "07 December, 2009", "body": "\n We had a big weekend after a sort of harried week, running around trying to prepare for this big weekend. We called banks, moved money around, photocopied and faxed papers and made a zillion phone calls. We oiled,  smogged  and waxed and wiped, then packed and drove to Tahoe, and everything went exactly as it should. Our family loves a good adventure. We plan well, and try to account for most contingencies, but the story is always better when things go wrong, as long as those things do not interrupt sleep or safety. In an effort to thwart those particular types of problems, and with great hope that we will be able to have Jake and Lucy experience as much of this country (continent?) as we can help them experience, in spite, and a bit because of disability, Descartes researched, and we just bought this weekend... Adventur eVan this really is a photo of our van with Lake Tahoe in the background. Sorry that this \" MonsterVan \",  as little Hawk called it,  has only this small picture to post so far. I have yet to photograph the entire thing myself. This van will allow us to go camping with Jake and know that he will be safe at night,  loc ked  in   tucked away and cozy. It has 4-wheel drive, so we can set up camp  in locations that are more off the beaten path, which generally means farther away from other people  and their cars . We can keep Jake safe in the woods, near bodies of water, cliffs and rocks, but it is nearly impossible to protect him from careless drivers in campgrounds, or the evil scowls from neighboring campers when he is hooting and hollering with happiness. AdventureVan  is gigantic, seats 12, has a pop up to p to provide a sleeping area, and provides our family with the comfort of being able to carry everything we need. Descartes spent a lot of time researching these types of vans. He actually told me he started to look when Jake was only 3 or 4, after he realized that our family's camping experience would probably need to  look a bit different than what camping looked like when he was a child. The first thing we had to do was trade our beloved  LandCruiser , but I know it was time to let it go (notice the mileage on the odometer over there). We took some great trips in that car, and it was the first major purchase Descartes and made together after we were married.  I stepped outside the house just as the new owner of the Cruiser was starting the engine, and I was  suprised  to have my eyes well up. I know it's going to a good home, a Daddy and his two beautiful girls. We all ended-up with what we needed. As soon as the papers were all signed and keys traded, we put in all of the car seats, noting how easily they all fit across the bench seats. We put Wolf, Hawk and Lucy across the back, Jake had his own row and  Jaster  and  Demanda  sat in the front bench. We enjoyed lunch at one of our favorite Mexican food places,  Taqueria   Jalisco ,  where the seating is easy and the customer service is kind and the food is delicious. Then we made Descartes drive us all around and all the way to  Red Lake Jaster  and Descartes did a happy dance on the banks after they discovered that the lake is indeed frozen over, and already shows signs of ice fishing, with 3 or 4 holes drilled already. I smiled happily because the children were all asleep (except Jake of course). A happy, driving, napping van. Descartes guided our crew back to South Lake through a snowstorm. Our first big trip will probably be to the Grand Canyon, but we will put the van to good use before then. I'm hoping for a grownups only trip to the wine country. It needs to be vacuumed and spit shined a bit, but it is so cool and the kids love it, and my husband is  happy . The kind of happy that I haven't seen sustained in a while, and it looks good on him. We made a good choice. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/Sx1GxPbdADI/AAAAAAAACMU/XNaTo2td-HY/s1600-h/2009-12-05+13.22.30.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/Sx0h-nXT4uI/AAAAAAAACL8/-3aVaa7sSEA/s1600-h/3k03o63l55O55T95Rd9au4bbbaf266c1d13cd.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/Sx1Hks7xtpI/AAAAAAAACM0/DEXu4-Wyd3E/s1600-h/3n53ma3l25Qe5Tb5R49au5b7c020425291d11.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/Sx1HVbN7gHI/AAAAAAAACMk/1pDtYcBLjBM/s1600-h/3n53k33l55Q85P55Sa9aue4009020baee14d2.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/Sx1G5AD8NoI/AAAAAAAACMc/WpRm_FNdR7w/s1600-h/2009-12-05+10.51.45.jpg", "http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-jalisco-south-lake-tahoe", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/Sx1GfF5OtTI/AAAAAAAACMM/GUBANkzlVYA/s1600-h/2009-12-05+13.22.14.jpg", "http://www.pbase.com/digerydo/image/71888017"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/12/adventurevan.html", "title": "\nAdventureVan\n"},

{"date": "10 September, 2009", "body": "\nSo I had a massive migraine today, and it occurred to me that perhaps my body doesn't understand this new feeling of stability and is going into some sort of hyper drive, creating its own sh*t to try its best to stay unhappy.. because nearly everything is going  really, really REALLY well. After a rough afternoon, I am now feeling much better and managed to get finish some paperwork and put together a little board meeting...and heck I'm even writing, which has not been happening very often lately. The scoop: Jake **loves** his new school. He runs upstairs for breakfast. He waits at the back door every morning when he is done eating. He is cooperative on the street when we put his bus harness on, and once he is zipped he turns around and gets into the school van and goes back to sit in his seat with very little prompting.  School highlights: Jake said \"rectangle\" on Thursday, and \" thirs ...\" for thirsty on Friday. He walked around the campus and when he got tired, instead of dropping to the ground in protest, he got into the wheelchair he was pushing He is allowing hand-over-hand help to do ART, and other fine motor like using scissors. When someone tries to interrupt his schedule he taps his schedule book to remind them of where he is supposed to be.  He participates in every school activity including yoga, music and P.E. Home highlights: Jake comes home happy...everyday... We took a road trip to Southern California, and stayed with my parents instead of a hotel. Jake did very well almost the entire time while we were at the house, and only had one (albeit large) incident at a restaurant.  Lucy and Jake have been interacting in very sweet ways wrestling and even snuggling in bed with mom and dad. Jake has been awesome visiting Lucy's new school, which he must do just about every day since his bus arrives at the exact time her school lets out. He has been calm, relaxed in a room of three year  olds  and has not for even once instant given me any trouble walking to and from the car (the entire school is built into a hill.) Lucy is loving her new school. She took off the first day, went to the opposite side of the room from me and began to play. She turned to the girl next to her and said, \"My name is Lucy. I'm going to play babies. Would you like to play babies with me?\" So far she wants to go to school every day \"except not on Saturday\", and she cannot remember  any one's  name. She is friends with \"the girl with the blue bow\", and \"the boy in the red shirt.\" We've met lots of nice parents, and Lucy has apparently been lovely every day. Her teacher Ms. Rudy has even gone so far as to say that Lucy was \"always\"polite. She does not want to leave school, and it has taken at least 20 minutes each day to convince her to leave with me. I still have much to do to feel successful at this Special Ed PTA thing this year. I didn't realize that I would actually feel any additional pressure when I changed roles, but apparently  Sage  did even more than I knew...and here I thought we did it all at  Peet's  Coffee on Tuesday mornings. We have a pretty good plan in place, but we need to add new member to our ranks so none of these amazing core people get too burned out.  And the house may regain some badly needed order after 3+ years of crazy Lucy and pregnancy before that. All of the clothes in our house are currently clean and folded except what we wore today and what we have on right now. Of course someone helped me get it to this point, but I have decided I am going to need someone to help for a few more big projects.. it didn't get this crazy around here over night, so I am realistic about how long it will take, but little by little, my hope is to cut the amount of stuff in our house by 1/3 by next summer.

Lord help them). I cannot explain how important it is to me to have just a a few nights away with Descartes when we are  not responsible  for Jake. Of course we still worry when he's at Camp, but we know he will be okay and that there's a huge staff of people who can care for him. We have been smart enough to install that weekly date night, which feels very decadent most of the time, but those few days he is at camp, and the date nights, I think that's the only way we are going to make it through parenting these children for the next gazillion years. We need to still like each other, even just a little bit, so we can make good decisions and feel safe, and protect our kids.. and if we get through with that.. we can try for emotional growth and well-being, a sense of self which is grounded in strong relationship blah blah blah.. all I know is that if Descartes and I hadn't taken those 4 days last summer to celebrate being married for 10 years I think I would still be sad right now about all of *those things* that we don't get to do.\u00a0 And then there's the idea of providing some kind of parity with the children. Lucy does her best to ensure that she is not ever forgotten, but she is told quite often to \"Wait just a minute. I'm helping Jake right now.\" \u00a0How many times can she hear that line and be okay? Maybe we'll be lucky and she will have an amazing depth of grace, but I imagine it will be easier for her to bear it all if she feels like she has us to her self a few days a year. \u00a0 And so.. I have my notes together and I'm off to bed. and DB.. just so you know I have at least 8 drafts saved... things I've been meaning to post. Maybe June will be a turning point in the writing department.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/06/tomorrow-which-is-now-today.html", "title": "\nTomorrow, Which is Now Today\n"},
{"date": "20 April, 2009", "body": "\nHere's a sampling of what I just turned in. ************************** In addition to typical Autism symptoms, CP Ataxia and Global Developmental delay, Jake also suffers from two major health issues. \u201cEpisodes\u201d Previous: Pain from unknown source for 9-11 days every 5-6 weeks \u201cepisodes\u201d resulting in near loss of sleep, severe agitation, self-injurious behavior and complete non-compliance. Jake also suffered from panic attacks which could blow up into major tantrum/agitation. Current:  Pain has been partially attributed to migraines. Episodes continue to come every 5-6 weeks, duration has been decreased to 5-6 days.  Severity seems to have diminished slightly. Reduction in symptoms can be attributed to better use of psychotropic drugs (Zoloft, Valium), better communication between home and school (to identify early symptoms) and use of Maxalt, an anti-migraine drug.  Panic attacks have decreased dramatically.  Jake still has severe agitation during episodes which have, in the last six months resulted in injury to both Jake and his caretakers (Aide, Mom and Dad). Desired Future Outcome: Continue to decrease intensity and duration of episodes. Increase Jake\u2019s communication skills using icons and \u201ctalkers\u201d so he can tell us when he is beginning to feel symptoms. The sooner we get the migraine medicine into him the more likely we are to reduce the severity of the episode. Continue use of Zoloft to discourage anxiety and panic attacks.\u00a0 Continue use of Valium when Jake\u2019s agitation peaks to avoid injury. Continue to use communication book back an forth to school to provide consistent care for Jake.  Teacher also phones and texts when she is concerned that he is entering an episode so I can drive to school and administer medicine. ADHD Previous: Inability to sit still in school, unable to calm down for dinner at home. Complete inability to eat in public, difficulty being calm enough to safely be a part of the community. Escaping, physical non-compliance led to (mild but constant) injury of both parents. Use of Adderall was ineffective after 6 months, adding late afternoon short-acting Ritalin had mild success. Current:  Jake now takes 18 milligrams of Concerta which lasts through most of the day without the side-effect of aggression or tears as the medicine wears off. Evening (6-8pm) is still difficult because the medicine is out of his system, but his behavior is more manageable and not as dangerous to himself or others. Camping, hiking or other outdoor activities (including a grocery store parking lot!) which are not safely guarded continue to be a problem; Jake\u2019s hand must be held AT ALL TIMES or he will run away. Desired Future Outcome: Continue use of Concerta so Jake is better able to acquire skills at school, and be included more often in after-school, dinner time and evening family and community events. Use of Respite: grocery shopping dental and medical visits for mom and other child sleep physical therapy laundry gym therapeutic massage date night PTA meetings educational lectures activities for other child (swimming lessons, ballet, art class since Jake is unable to wait during \u00bd hour classes) sleep coffee with friends car repair banking post office IEP/school meetings library watching mindless television/reading being on the other floor of my house miscellaneous errands                                                                                      \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/04/asking-for-respite.html", "title": "\nAsking for Respite\n"},

Every study conducted to test  Wakefield 's MMR hypothesis, he concluded, \"found no evidence that the MMR vaccination is associated with autism.\"  And the evidence \"falls far short\" of showing a thimerosal connection.    \u00a0    \"That is hardly the end of the legal cases.

In postings on antivaccine sites such as GenerationRescue.org and SafeMinds.org, parents have made clear that they think the system is rigged and that vaccines condemned their children to a lifetime of being barricaded behind the impregnable wall of autism. Perhaps it should not be a mystery why people refuse to believe science, with its tentative hypotheses, zigzag pathway to finding answers and a record of getting some things wrong before getting them right (see hormone-replacement therapy ).\u00a0On the day the court announced its decision, Offit pointed out that \"tens of millions of dollars have been spent trying to answer these questions [about vaccines and autism],\" but many people \"refuse to believe the science.\" Perhaps, he mused, that's \"because while it's very easy to scare people, it's very hard to unscare them .\"\"    and perhaps the most tragic line:\u00a0    \u00a0    \"... it's impossible to prove a negative such as \"vaccines do not cause autism.\"    I know that Jake was not one of those kids who seemingly disappeared right after his MMR... so I cannot imagine how I might feel if I thought that had happened to him. I'd like to think that in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence I would still\u00a0eschew undocumented theories and pseudo-science that has maintained its appearance of truth merely by preying on parents\u2019 fears and dashed hopes. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/02/anatomy-of-scare-how-childhood-vaccines.html", "title": "\n"},

{"date": "13 November, 2008", "body": "\nfrom  Thescientist.com Two large-scale genetic analyses have turned up a trio of new sites associated with autism, including a large-effect allele that seems to reduce the risk of developing the debilitating brain disorder, researchers reported today (Nov. 12) at the American Society of Human Genetics  meeting in Philadelphia . Last year, the Autism Genome Project Consortium performed the largest genome-wide linkage scan to date with around 10,000 SNPs in 1,181 families with at least two affected individuals. The group flagged a handful of  genomic regions harboring autism  susceptibility genes, although none of the linkage results were statistically significant (/ Nat Genet/, 39:319-328, 2007 ). Now, a team led by  Dan Arking , a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University, has ramped up the SNP count to include around 500,000 markers in 802 affected pairs of siblings. They then eliminated all the error-prone or uninformative SNPs to amass a collection of 180,000high-quality markers for their analysis. \"It's the cleanest best set of markers you can imagine,\" Arking said at a press conference. This enhanced genome-wide scan proved effective. Arking's team discovered two regions of significant linkage that had not been implicated before with the disease -- one at the tip of chromosome 20's short arm, and one at the end of chromosome 6's long arm. Arking, together with  Lauren Weiss , a molecular geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco, also used the SNP dataset to perform familial association mapping in 1,594 parent-offspring trios to hunt for common variants of major effect linked to the disorder. At first, they did not find any genome-wide significant results. Additional assays, however, revealed a hitherto unidentified site on chromosome 5 where one particular allele was transmitted less often than expected to autistic individuals whose parents carried the allele. Thus, this allele, although only found in 4% of the population as a whole, likely confers some protection against autism, Arking and Weiss argued. This \"protective allele\" fell near the  semaphorin  5A (/SEMA5A/) gene, which is involved in axonal guidance during neural development. The researchers compared brain slices of 20 autistic individuals with 10 controls and found that /SEMA5A/ had much lower expression levels in the autistic brains, further implicating this novel locus with autism. Arking and Weiss will present their findings in a  talk  on Saturday (Nov. 15) and in a  poster  on Friday (Nov. 14).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/55186/", "http://www.ashg.org/2008meeting", "http://www.the-scientist.com/2008/6/1/26/1/", "http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v39/n3/abs/ng1985.html", "http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/geneticmedicine/People/Faculty/Arking.html", "http://psych.ucsf.edu/faculty.aspx?id=2774", "http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/21491/", "http://www.ashg.org/2008meeting/abstracts/fulltext/f22475.htm", "http://www.ashg.org/cgi-bin/2008/ashg08s?author=weiss%20l&sort=ptimes&sbutton=Detail&absno=22118&sid=338373"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/11/new-large-scale-genetic-analyses-more.html", "title": "\n"},

I have noticed lately that little Lucy is a rather chatty little girl. She came out ready to go. At 2 hours old she had her eyes wide open and her mouth poised to speak. She has a LOT to say.  She says it well, very well even, for a not yet 2.5 year old in big long sentences sometimes. She is remarkable, and people, friends, find it amusing to note that she \"talks almost as much as her mother.\"  That's the other thing about these quirky kids, and more often their parents... we don't aways get social cues. This was one area that I had always thought myself rather savvy, the social cues part, but I am thinking lately that I have really, really, not heard all of the subtle and not so subtle ways people have been letting me know that I talk too much; too much, too often, over people, through people, dominating conversations and dictating when others speak. This trait I had always put on my assets side, the side with thin ankles and a college education, when it's looking more like this trait falls, apparently much more solidly on the side with thinning hair and my inability to remember people's names.

Does this happen to other people? Are there things you thought you were good at that end up being something everyone else hates about you? Something you never thought of as a problem that once it comes to light makes you toss and turn?  We are loathe to label our children because we are afraid it will define them, limit them, make it so it's hard for people to look past their disability. What if they change or develop past that label? Will anyone notice, or will they look at what was decided about them years before and just prejudge them?

It's something I have done hundreds of times and enjoyed every single time without butterflies, and the last several times? well... It's good to face your flaws. It's good to have people care enough to point them out to you. It gives you a chance to right them. Better now before I'm 40 so maybe I have a chance at the second half of my life of being a little less ego centric and little less selfish.  Maybe I can ask more questions. I can hold my tongue and not share my opinion, because Lord knows I have one on every subject. I have already tried the not calling people thing; I don't need to be that phone call that people dread answering. Although, and I'll be honest, I can have this sick feeling in my stomach and vow every night that tomorrow I will keep my mouth closed, but in the moment.. I don't know how. I don't know how to keep a story inside. I don't know how to give the short response. I don't understand how to keep the phone on the table when I want to share something. I don't know what it's like to walk past other people in the grocery store or on the street and  not  say hello, or chat with the checker or the person behind me in line. I've been  teaching  Lucy that we do not stare. I've been teaching that when we make eye contact with someone we say \"Hello\" or \"Good morning\" or \"How are you?\" I've been teaching her because people are going to be staring at my family a lot over her lifetime and I want her to be armed with words so she can make the situation of having a brother with special needs less awkward.. for herself, for others.  Lately I'm feeling like it's just one more thing I am doing wrong in the parenting department because clearly it's not working out for me to have learned to be a \"Chatty Kathy\".\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SQGHUTI6NSI/AAAAAAAABTw/EhovT8pmasQ/s1600-h/babykate+2+hours+old.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/10/chit-chat.html", "title": "\nChit Chat\n"},

Today is \"Free Wednesday\", and while I think that is just fantastic for everyone else, those kind of crowds do not make navigation easy, so we will skip that. Jake is feeling a little bit better in terms of episode...I think... He was able to lunch yesterday at a restaurant.  Sage  met us at the local Indian buffet and he was well behaved and was even following some directions. Jake and I \"rolled\" around the shopping area from 10:30-2pm waiting for our car to get new  run flat tires , then new front and rear brakes... ouch to the wallet. Run fat tires are a great idea, but they cost at least twice as much as most tires and last half as long.  Anywhoo, Jake went into his wheelchair happily... he has a cold so he was a bit lethargic, which after the past however many weeks of spazzing and throwing, I'll admit I was a little bit okay seeing. We went to a discount store where he picked out his costume.. a skeleton. He laughed when I told him it was perfect because he was skin and bones already. I don't think Lucy is going to be thrilled with Jake's choice of costume. She is prety convinced that she is going to be a penguin, Jake is going to be a puppy, Daddy is going to be a pumpkin and I am going to be a bee. Just ask her. SHe's been saying this for at least a month now. How  quirky  she is! Wish us luck we are off to Lucy's swimming lesson. Jake hates it there... lovely. ************************* Swimming update... Jake did very well at the enclosed noisy swim school that Lucy loves so much. Half way through the lesson my dear Squid came to entertain Jake so I could help the teacher Faith, remind Lucy to use \"big arms\". Jake even gave Squid a little low five in the car and smiled when she asked whether he was going to come over to her house soon. Yay for friends! Yay for Jake feeling better! Yay for giant coloring book purchased for Lucy at Costco which may keep her entertained for the next 15 minutes!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.the-mama.blogspot.com", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-flat_tire", "http://www.cafepress.com/septar.294651027"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/10/fall-break-week-one-update.html", "title": "\nFall Break Week One Update\n"},

His toes cling to the bed post as he creeps them up and down lying on his back looking at the very dimmed light fixture. I crawl in next to him for a moment, because I miss him, this calm him, because I want relationship with my own son who  won't  can't make eye contact with me. I want to at least  feel  close to him, and since he isn't flailing about I think I can. So I lay on the twin bed. He is nearly as long as I am, but he is all bones and muscle and joints. Even his frame is hard to hold because he is angular against my motherly roundness. I hug him and he rolls into me, his face next to mine on the pillow. me: \"Jake, I love you so much. I'm so glad you're feeling better.\" Jake: \"Mmph\"  said with a smile me: \"Jake I love you. Can you tell mommy 'I love you?' Can you say 'love'?\" Jake:  clearly  \"Love.\" He is happy this morning, lots of happy sounds and running up and down the stairs , jumping and smiling at the sight of a fresh cup of milk or more cheerios. Maybe he is  back from where ever he goes when he is so upset in his own body. He's back and he may have learned more new skills again. It was hard this time. Physical injuries and a baby sister who felt abandoned. Descartes and I only fought one time, and only for a moment, so we are better at this, but we're still learning.  There's no rulebook for our child, or this life. There's only slowly moving forward, hoping that the next time we come more prepared, with a more fortified army of caretakers, medications and resources.

But I have somehow avoided real life for nearly two weeks with travel and family, so I suppose I've actually been living my \"real\" life instead of blogging about it.  I've actually had so much to say lately that I didn't really have the energy to write it down.  A few things... Jake has been doing okay in school. His new aide Lynna is young and strong. She appears confident, and gets along well with the other adults in the class, which I think is key to Jake's success. Jake cried every day for two weeks in the morning before school. We would get two blocks from school (at a stop sign near a 7-11..and since he's never had a negative experience  there , I had to assume it is his last marker in knowing that he is indeed going to school). He wold cry with real tears. Something that doesn't happen very often. Only when he's injured...or very  very  sad about something. It would take him another 40 minutes at school with Janet comforting him and talking about change, and how Anna still loves him, but she is working somewhere else now before he would begin to be okay. Eventually he would calm down and has had pretty good days. We shall see. Sadly there is no real way for me to observe Jake with his new aide without becoming a part of the environment. I expect that Janet will keep me informed, and Jake's home aide is also in the class, so while I don't like her to \"spy\" for me, I know she would say something if it was a bad match. For now I am home with both kiddos. Jake has a cold. He slept until just a few minutes ago, and Lucy is happy to stay in her jammies and watch a kid show in the living room). She spent her days in SoCal with paper dolls and pink castles and the full attention of Grandma, Grandpa and mommy, her time further punctuated by adoration from her cousin Bubsy, aunts and uncles, and a whole other set of grandparents. She's an outgoing kid but I think even Lucy is enjoying being left alone this morning.

{"date": "18 August, 2008", "body": "\nAnna, Jake's loving, kind, tender, demanding, experienced aide..is no longer going to be his aide at school. She can't physically care for him and take care of her body. When she asked about the future, changing her position in the class, being his aide half day etc, on Friday, she had no idea that it would mean that Monday morning she would be somewhere else. I sobbed on the side of the road after I dropped Jake off at school today. His classroom teacher Janet had tears in her eyes when she told me. She didn't know until this morning either when Anna called, also in tears. It was the right thing for the district to move her. She will be with pre-school kids now; little ones who are a third of Jake's body weight. She will help little 3 and 4 year olds with disabilities and sad mommies, and those people will be so lucky to have her there. She is a good egg. She is good to the core. and we will be okay. I can say that now, 12 hours later without having the tears in my eyes slip out onto my cheek. Okay I guess not. I am crying again. It goes like this right? I mean change is the only thing that's constant. It will be a growth experience for all of us. We will find someone else who will care for Jake, and fit into the classroom, and not be bitter that my nearly 8 year old still isn't toilet trained. He or she will help him eat, and encourage him and know soon enough what his favorite book is and remember first to offer him water when he is upset. I had to explain my tears to Lucy who sat patiently in the back seat eating vanilla wafers while I pulled to the curb and cried in my hands that no I was not mad at her. I said I was sad, and she asked me why. I didn't tell her the whole truth. I left out the part about how people are unkind, and impatient, and most won't bother to learn all of Jake's subtle cues about when he needs to eat and pee and rest and run. Didn't tell her that while aides get paid a bit more for a kid in pull ups they will begrudge every minute they are in the bathroom with your kid...or worse yet leave your kid in soiled pants and let them get on the bus because they won't be there on the other end of the ride when Jake is miserable and yelling and has kicked off his shoes because he is so upset and embarrassed. I didn't tell her that the difference between a good aide and a bad one will make our home life easy or hard every single day. I left out that an aide without intuition may as well not be there, and that if her brother isn't pushed and held to standards he won't learn and grow and we will lose even more time. I couldn't bare the thought of explaining that most people will just think her brother is severely mentally retarded and never even notice that he laughs at jokes and smirks when he has gotten away with something. I didn't tell her that I was crying because her brother's life is hard on an easy day and finding someone he can spend all those hours with and feel safe and happy will be just one more thing that makes it hard for mommy to relax while he is in school. I told her I was sad because one of Jake's teachers had to get a different job, and that Jake was really going to miss her. She asked if it was Anna.  and when I told her it was, Lucy said \"me too.\" We will all miss her. I picked Jake up from school so he could have some time with Anna who had to come back to his school to drop off her keys. They hugged and we all cried and Jake kept hugging her and loving on her. We gave her a pretty ring as a goodbye present, and I made sure she has all of our information. Her new school is actually only three blocks from our house, so maybe we will get to see her sometimes, but we know how it goes in this life. I am trying to just sit in the space of thanks. I am so thankful that we had a chance to have her as such an important part of Jake's life. He is a better kid for having her as an aide, and I was so thankful for being able to relax when he was in her care. and now I am going to drink a beer.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/08/change.html", "title": "\nChange\n"},

We won't need to stay here again any time soon, especially since my sister lives in Lake Tahoe, but it was fun, and cheesy and cheap and the room was clean and the food at Trader Dick's was actually pretty good.                   We get on the road and head west. Reno-->Eagle Lake total miles driven today 114 miles Eagle Lake is very pretty with no real place to eat, and apparently we are sort of hungry. The campground at Eagle Lake looks promising for a family trip possibly with Descartes' parents and their RV. Fairly easy road in, lots of flat area to park, and not crowded, always a plus for our family. It was a little sad for me in Yosemite to really look at the tent cabins in Curry Village and realize that we will probably not be able to do that with Jake. It would just be too crowded and too close to other people. Heck, it might be too much for Descartes too. Again it brings up the problem I am constantly churning..how to ensure that we give Lucy access to all of the things we love and believe in, like the great outdoors, and camping and hiking and sea kayaking and bicycling, and public transportation and fine dining and funky locals dining and travel to foreign countries where you don't even speak the language. How do we do all that with a kid that does better with routine and our Not-so-mini-Van. It will mean splitting our family up in the future, so Daddy can take Lucy hiking in the back country, or Mommy can take Lucy to Paris and Barcelona. We did a lot of scouting on this trip, and did find a few places that looked safe for Jake and fun for both kids. Eagle Lake-->Chester total miles driven today 170 miles We are hungry so we stop in Chester. The catalogs which advertise houses for sale leave me chuckling. I guess there are a lot of Country Club type places around Lake Almanor and has gained a bit of prestige. Still looks like a small lake town to me. Chester-->Bumpass hill total miles driven today 211 miles We hike at altitude 8000-8300' for nearly four miles to see California's version of Yellowstone.It is a great hike, and we laugh that we sure do exercise a lot more without our kids around. I vow to figure out how to take Jake on a hike. I have friends who would go with me/help me. It is now a summer goal. Descartes and I take mental notes of the people we pass wearing inappropriate footwear, given that there are sheer cliffs, talus slopes, snow,  geothermic, bubbling gooey pots and  fumaroles . Jeesh people at lest wear some tennis shoes. It takes us a bit longer than the two hours..more like three because there are people wearing Tevas and no socks trying to avoid puddles, and there is a lot more snow than we expected. I think they had just opened the trail. Quite often high-country trails don't open until July. We wind our way through the rest of the park. We've both been here before, so while we are impressed by the beauty, we decide not to hike anything else. We are headed to Shingletown and possibly Manton, where there is a small winery and an inn. Bumpass--> Shingletown total miles driven today 247 We enter Shingletown and spot 5 fire trucks in front of the local pizza parlor, none of them local. Fresno, Clovis, central valley types. After purchasing a local paper we discover there is a fire named after the town. Can't stay here so we head towards the other small town.. only to find that the road is actually closed because the road runs right through the fire. We go back to 299 and continue west. Shingletown-->Redding total miles driven today 276 miles. We simply can't stay here. It's too smoky and ugly. I tell Descartes that we can't stay in Reno and Redding on the same trip...but there are good burgers at a roadside stand and a Starbucks at the right turn to continue on 299 west View Larger Map Redding-->Whiskeytown/Weaverville total miles driven today: 321 can't stay here there's  another  fire. Whiskeytown-->ARCATA BAY total miles driven today: 417 on nearly all windy roads There is fire nearly the entire length of 299. Beautiful at night. We pull over to the side of the road near the seven rivers area and listen to the crackles and pop of flame and watch an entire river valley go up in a frightening blaze. There is no wind, so it is quiet except for the roar of the fire. Beautiful and tragic. Arcata-->Eureka total miles driven today: 425 We land in Eureka and expect to find a hotel room at 11:30 pm because it is Eureka in the middle of the week and there are a ton of little Travel Lodge Best Western type places because Humboldt State is not far from here. We go from hotel to motel to dive and find everything is booked  except for one room which is so disgusting the owner of the motel offers to show it to us first because she says it is \"really no nice at all.\" It was so bad. It was bad like meth head bad. Like Trainspotting toilet scene bad (at least from what I remember because I can never watch  that  again Eureka-->Ferndale total  miles driven today 444. We head to Ferndale, hoping for a small in with a door bell and a grumpy but hospitable inn keeper. It is 12:43am and it looks like Ferndale is asleep for the night, which I think is pretty reasonable for a  Victorian Village  and then guess what happens as we are calmly and quietly going 5 miles an hour down this quaint low-lying coastal town? The tsunami warning siren goes off.  As it turns out our Not-s-mini-Van can flip a u-turn and drive 68 mph through a very small town and over a one lane bridge very very quickly when Descartes is driving. Faster than I could google \"tsunami warning\" or \"major earthquake\". Descartes makes an executive decision that we are going inland even if the siren was a mistake. I love my husband. There is no way in hell we would have slept if we were in a hotel near the water. We would both be waiting for the water. Ferndale-->Grizzly Creek Redwood State Park total miles driven for the day  472   We head back towards the center of the state on highway 36. It is 1am. We are on plan  \"Q\" seeing as plans A-P have fallen apart slowly over the course of the day. We head to the nearest campground, clean out the back of the van  (stuffing everything in the front seats, crack open a bottle of expensive wine and toast our good luck. We are alive, and dry and not on fire and although Descartes is 6'5\" and has size 16 feet, he can still fit on our Japanese Not-so-mini-Van. I praise his foresight in having brought a lantern, two headlamps, two pillows, a blanket, a tarp and a wine bottle opener. We wake in the morning to find ourselves, not so entirely sore or cold, and in the midst of a great, uncrowded campground. We smell like a campfire from having driven through 600 of them, but overall, we are no worse for the wear, and it makes for a much better story. There is no one in the world with whom I'd rather take a road trip. Days like those.. they make me know Descartes and I  make a great team and work really well together. Now I understand how we made it through those 50 days when Jake didn't sleep...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SGfoCOygrpI/AAAAAAAAA0Y/1fUUe3CQc-4/s1600-h/redemption+change.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SGfoCOygrpI/AAAAAAAAA0Y/1fUUe3CQc-4/s1600-h/redemption+change.jpg", "http://forum.surfthechannel.com/uploads/1199719750/gallery_4995_4_614150.jpg", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SGgvdphBTDI/AAAAAAAAA0g/kxhSo6sHSfg/s1600-h/chester,+ca.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudpot", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SGhJLIrj8EI/AAAAAAAAA1c/pIqnPo8v6R4/s1600-h/CIMG5423.JPG", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumarole", "http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=&saddr=reno&daddr=eagle+lake+to:chester,+ca+to:Lassen+Volcanic+National+Park+to:Shingletown,+CA+to:Redding,+ca+to:weaverville,+ca+to:Arcata,+CA+to:4+4th+St,+Eureka,+CA+95501+to:Ferndale,+CA+to:16949+State+Highway+36,+Carlotta,+CA+95528+%28Grizzly+Creek+Redwoods+State+Park%29&mra=pi&mrcr=9&sll=40.463666,-122.03064&sspn=1.855585,4.812012&ie=UTF8&ll=40.463666,-122.03064&spn=1.855585,4.812012&source=embed", "http://www.victorianferndale.org/chamber/", "http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/c1187/", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SGhDJ4SXSDI/AAAAAAAAA0w/3gttGe9V8ZY/s1600-h/tsunami_sign.gif", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SGhFNViu2LI/AAAAAAAAA1U/h3pgQRiKRYE/s1600-h/CIMG5470.JPG"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/06/anniversary-trip-day-three-crossing.html", "title": "\nAnniversary Trip Day Three: Crossing the State\n"},

We did have Sage and her wonderful family over on Saturday night. They are such an easy crew with whom to pass the time. I love that her seemingly quiet husband has become the joking conversationalist as he has come to know us, and that their daughter is now a little chatterbox where she once looked wide-eyed and a little afraid of us. We are not a quiet family with a quiet life. Even on a sleepy day we still have Jake and his unpredictability and Lucy and her wackiness, and me with my drama and need to please and entertain, and two gigantic golden retrievers, and my dear Descartes who by sheer height can worry some people (it's a good thing he has a baby face...).  It's been a good thing to have people over more often. We will figure it out. Now that the backyard has usable space I don't feel like there is nowhere to go. I know we always have enough food and drink, but I worry about trying to crowd people into too small a space...especially people with kids who need a lot of space, or distance from my special kid. If I can just get a grip on the clothing mountains and the paper foothills variously piled throughout closets and corners I'm sure the place will feel bigger. I saw a shed at Costco last night and contemplated putting it in the side yard and calling it my office. (Don't worry mom...I'm kidding) Driving around the state with Descartes I realize by all of his comments, how happy he would be, how happy each of us would be, if we had a little bit of fenced-in land that was not so close to neighbors. Jake was always so, so happy in Montana, and of course Descartes loves to build things. If my property in north-eastern California were closer, I'm sure we would have a small cabin by now.  It would be nice to have it while the kids were little and still wanted to hang out with us, but I am hoping that within ten years we will be able to buy just a few acres...somewhere.. fence it in, make it safe for Jake and be able to relax while Jake plays in the woods (his favorite thing in the world to do).  We've talked about buying a place near here in the Santa Cruz mountains. Something close by we could use every weekend if we wanted. I keep checking the ads... one day we will find the perfect place. Jake went back to school this morning and Descartes went back to work. They both put on cheerful faces before they left the house, but I know that neither one of them enjoyed getting up this morning. Lucy and I have already had breakfast and played the www.pbskids.org Caillou games. I do not understand her obsession with this whiny, balding, four year old kid, but the television family seems decent enough and he gets  busted when he's mean to his sibling, so the lessons aren't bad at all. I need to get Lucy her own computer. Something sturdy she and Jake can use. Jake has always loved computer at school, and with more help and practice it could be a very useful tool for him... and Lucy wants to \"move da mouse squeak squeak\" and \"Click now? Click now? Now mommy?\" So I am thinking she's ready too.  Lucy meets her new day care provider this afternoon, but first she must go to her 2 year old appointment. Will there be shots? Hmm must remember to bring lollipops.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SGj38V42rXI/AAAAAAAAA1s/dmcKm21j2j8/s1600-h/CIMG5406.JPG"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/06/back-to-schooland-work.html", "title": "\nBack to School...and work\n"},

{"date": "23 June, 2008", "body": "\n Monday morning. Descartes is clearly on vacation because he cannot sleep in. He dosed me with cold medicine last night so I'm groggy as all get out which we decide is pretty funny since it appears this may be about the only way to get me to be quiet.  I do not fully wake up for hours...I sleep with my eyes open through breakfast and the drive into the park. We pack it up and head back to downtown Groveland to drop off our room key and eat the free breakfast. Back in Yosemite National Park we park our car and unload bikes. It is a beautiful day. I'm nut sure where all those people are from last night, but they aren't here now. Riding bikes on the valley floor is fairly easy, but we do find one small (still paved) trail to huff and puff up for a  very short while. We end up at Mirror Lake, where we lock up and do a little trail walking. In spite of the wildfire smoke, it is beautiful as well. I keep saying, \"Wow I feel lucky today.\" We decide we should have lunch at the Ahwahnee Hotel. It is an old skool place. If you have never seen it, I put it in the same category as the Claremont in Berkeley and the Royal Hawaiian on Waikiki Beach. We sat on the patio of the Ahwahnee Bar and were pleasantly surprised by how good the food was, having heard not so many raving reviews. The cheese plate was really high-end, with pistachios, dried cherries and a very yummy goat cheese being my favorites of the selection. I drink a sidecar, because I figure we are in the perfect place to have one, and I miss my friend Squid who loves them. It was perfect. Little munchkin  chikarees  race around our feet as we eat and I am thinking this is possibly the best day I have had in a long time. We call it a day for the valley floor, pack up our bikes and head out of YNP toward  Tuolumne Meadows  and on to  Mono Lake . Mono Lake is interesting, but as far as I can tell, I actually don't need to go there again. Total miles driven on the trip so far 519 We make a left on 395, marvel at the crazy amount of smoke from the wildfires and drive straight through to...RENO. Seriously? Yes. We stayed at  John Asquaga's Nugget . More for a joke than anything else. We went here a long time ago with very good friends and had a terrific time. This time we get upgraded at the desk, and stayed in a very nice redecorated room that had a freeway running right outside the window. We dined at  Trader Dick's  and for nostalgia's sake we had a Scorpion bowl. Between the two of us lost a total of $39.00 and managed to play video poker and some roulette for hours.. so I am thinking we got our money's worth. In the morning, the smoke outside from the wildfires is so think it seems that Reno is on fire.  Poor Nevada..bad enough to live in Reno, but they have all of this horrible smoke from California and no ocean breeze to knock it away any time soon. It's just sitting there hanging. A satellite image from MODIS. We learn on the news that there are over 800 wildfires buring in California. We decide that we will head west. It is 81 degrees at 8:30am. Ugh.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SGV7QyRNZyI/AAAAAAAAAzo/EJpELtfntTE/s1600-h/CIMG5345.JPG", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SGZf813kFZI/AAAAAAAAA0I/q9lSjdA42Sw/s1600-h/CIMG5348.JPG", "http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/grinnell/mammals67.htm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuolumne_Meadows", "http://www.monolake.org/live/monocam.htm", "http://www.janugget.com/hotel/remodel.cfm", "http://partners.visitrenotahoe.com/janugget/traderdicks", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SGZ0Y7PZg9I/AAAAAAAAA0Q/Swoi75XSisw/s1600-h/nugget+glass.jpg", "http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/individual.php?db_date=2008-06-25"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/06/anniversary-trip-day-two-yosemite.html", "title": "\nAnniversary Trip Day Two: Yosemite\n"},
{"date": "22 June, 2008", "body": "\n (Lucy was picked up Saturday afternoon by Oma and Papa... we are down to three of us at the house.) Sunday we finish loading up the car. I am able to sweep the kitchen floor before we leave. Jake is excited about Camp as we drive away. Our bikes are on the back of the Not-so-Mini Van. The trailer hitch scrapes the driveway as we make a right off of the hill. We don't care. My suitcase is filled with clothes I'm sure I won't need, and a bottle of really good aged Cab that I'm sure we'll want. We have Rockst*rs, and Lifesavers and we have remembered Jake's sleeping bag and pillow. Jake is safely deposited at Camp until Friday. He has an awesome counseleor, Sam and his counselor from before Liz is the cabin head in charge of his cabin. Jake is quiet, and happy and we leave the Santa Cruz mountains knowing that Jake is in good hands. Miles driven: 21.6 Time: 2:45pm Sunday June 22, 2008 We take off. Descartes has loaded the CD folders with an amazing collection of music. Lots of it is oddly enough from ten years ago. We realize that this is not because we loved the music then (although we did like a lot of it) but because this is the last time we spent money on music. Withni one year of being married we spent 8 weeks in Europe (which is a reasonable way to spend money..) Then we got pregnant 6 months after that, and bought a house 5 months later.... there goes the music budget. It is hot and a bit smoky as we head inland, but the car has just been tuned so the A/C runneth cold and the air filter removed all of the large particles. We had to the center of California, and keep going. We check in with Oma and Papa. Lucy is precious on the phone. She apparently is he mother's daughter as she has decided her new bedtime is many hours after it should be..but she still wakes up before 7am. A little miniature both-end candle burner. That's my girl! We decide to stay in  Groveland , CA.  The Hotel Charlotte  is technically booked but they have an \"off-site\" property.. which is a  house . So we rent the house, drop our stuff and drive into Yosemite for the evening. It is more than a little bit cool that we have managed to go to Yosemite for dinner. The park is packed, but the beer is cold and we find a table to eat our  pizza  and salad. We listen to part of a park ranger lecture about the  Firefall  as the bats fly about. Then head back to our house for the night. Along the route home we stop at a vista point and watch the stars for a minute and gaze out at a  roaring fire across the valley. It seems like there are more fires than we have ever seen before in previous years. The house is cool and quiet. The bed has three mattresses and takes a ladder (practically) to climb into. We drink a beer, toast our good fortune and sleep well.

{"date": "20 June, 2008", "body": "\nwhen I recently ran across this article  Young HA, et al, Thimerosal exposure in infants and neurodevelopmental disorders: An assessment of computerized medical records in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, J Neurol Sci (2008), doi:10.1016/j.jns.2008.04.002 I am not one to flutter about (HA!) having the life sucked out of me by the  Internets okay Yes I am, but I really started to read this study and I thought KRAP..maybe that damn thimerosal is the culprit (knowing full well that Jake had no thimerosal in his vaccines...) It's published by the  Journal of Neurological Sciences  it really seems legit, but it kept saying funny things (a direct quote follows): \"For example, 37% of autism cases in the study were diagnosed after 5 years old with about 50% diagnosed after 4.5 years old. This is a conservative estimate since it includes the 2 years (1995\u20131996) that had shorter follow-up times. Examination of the distribution of age of diagnosis by birth year for autism revealed that only about 15% of cases were diagnosed after 5 years of age in the 1995 birth cohortwhile the 1996 cohort had no cases diagnosed after 5 years of age and only 3.5% of cases diagnosed between 4.5 and 5 years of age. Based on the average age at diagnosis for all cohorts, the 1995 count of autism cases was increased by 45 cases with the assumption that all of these would have been added in the 5 year+ age group (bringing this percentage close to the overall average of 37%diagnosed after 5 years of age). The same was done for 1996, but the number of cases was augmented by 80 because it was assumed that these would be diagnosed in the 4.5 to 5 and 5+ groups essentially bringing the percentage diagnosed after age 4.5 close to the overall average of 50% diagnosed after 4.5 years of age. The newaugmented frequency counts of cases in 1995 and 1996 birth cohorts were then used as the new case counts in the analysis.\" I am pretty sure if you re-read that a few times it seems like they ADDED autism diagnosis where there were none. They added them because in other years there were more? Because it seemed like there should have been more? Isn't that not exactly examining the data? Isn't that actually making up the data? I went poking around the Internet and discovered that I was not the only person to think it was a leetle bit off.. a  much  better explanation of all of the faults can be found over at   Epi Wonk .  Thank you Epi Wonk for being so smrt (If you rad through responses to her post you'll also find some of the  best  crazy comments by John Best who is a very angry man who I will not bother to  link to.) Anywhoo I know this has been out for about a month but as usual I am slow to respond. BTW it also seems like half of the references in the \"study\" reference one Geier or another. Isn't that a little bit suspect as well? okay all done... Lucy dislocated her elbow today threatening to throw off our entire \"escape from Deadwood\" plan... I thought she cracked her wrist the way she was holding it. I was holding her hand when she decided she did not want to go get her special needs brother from the short bus (we need to drive down the hill to pick him up) She dropped to the floor and twisted at the same time. I heard a horrible sound. What I heard was her little bone slipping out from between her other two little bones.  Yechh. She cried. I cried. I made an appointment to go to the urgent care where the doc promptly shoved her little elbow back together (making me feel a little like an idget since my dad and I had JUST talked about this happening to me 6 hours prior). It is called  nursemaid 's elbow. I called it milkmaid elbow in a  Tweet earlier  but I have now figured it out. So she is fine now and Jake is sleeping soundly, and it is only 85 degrees outside at 12:20am and I only need to pack Lucy and Jake by tomorrow am. No big whoop.

I am not trying hard enough, and I have nothing more to give to my children and my marriage. I have lost myself. I am failing my special-needs child. I am not using the gifts God has given me. I have no faith. I am tired and there is nothing to serve my family for dinner. My house is a mess. My vocabulary is weak. My hair is thinning and has split ends. I never sing anymore and I am too quick to judge others. I have no patience. I am lost and it is all hopeless. \n...and then minute sixteen comes and we are all going to be okay. Really okay. All of the previous moments are nearly erased (save for the aching back)...and we just move forward. We do our best; praying for great things and planning for the realities of our life. I am the strongest woman in the world, and possibly the luckiest. \n \nWell Bridquet bought me a quarter-of-an-hourglass. It is beautiful and looks very much like the photo here. What is even more meaningful are the words she spoke to me..and I am paraphrasing. \n \nFor those 15 minutes it is like you are in the hourglass. Trapped and struggling, slipping bit by bit with nothing to grab on to, nothing to stand on. You are stumbling and falling and nearly buried alive. It feels like you will never get the right side up again.  \n \nand here is the part that was so kind \n \nYou are the sixteenth minute. You land upon the top of those grains of sand and you are grounded and standing tall and everything is under control. You are the sixteenth minute for your family.

{"date": "03 February, 2008", "body": "\n The paver guys come tomorrow. In a matter of days the bulk of the backyard will be finished. It will cost about $2000 a day to have it done. That is an ugly amount of money... I do however think that this money is better spent now on Jake and his happiness than saving it for an unknown college future. Perhaps that is short-sighted of me, but I want my son to have a safe place to play. A place where he is happy so his sister thinks he is cool and fun...and selfishly? I want to look at a nice backyard when I come into my house and when I do the dishes. It is a good thing for the family. It is painful to pay others for something we physically can do, and technically can understand, but we are realizing that we actually don't have as much time to complete projects as we think. When I was Jake's age I helped my dad build things. I helped garden. I cleaned out the garage with my mom. I sorted laundry. I forget that some of the reason I can't get done what my mother seemed to accomplish easily is because I have this special needs kid. He  can't help on those projects, but more than that, I can't actually do them because he can't be trusted to stay safe while I do the task. Gardening in the front yard would be inviting death since we have no fence keeping us from the street..and we are on a hill. The property in the back would seem a place he could play while I plant bulbs or weed, but there is an empty lot with another hill that leads to neighbors who aren't all that nice. Anyway. I fold laundry downstairs while Jake plays close by on the deck. Friday I had the babysitter play with the kids on the deck so I could garden on the hill in the front but still spend time near them. It felt a little bit like when I was a kid. I guess I want my kids to have memories of me like I have of my dad digging and planting. To me gardening is a physical expression of hope and faith. Planting a bulb and waiting months for the promise of a bloom? You can water and weed the area, mulch and  still you might not get a flower later. Most times you do, but if it's anything like the planting at our house--in my harried rush to plant in five minute spurts here and there, I throw all of the bulbs in a box in October. Then in February, March and April... I never even know what kind of flower is going to come up.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/R6tzEmPyhbI/AAAAAAAAAs8/5LHJPUnHtQE/s1600-h/Copy+of+0203080943a.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/02/backyard-makeover-continues.html", "title": "\nBackyard Makeover Continues\n"},

{"date": "01 April, 2008", "body": "\nI made my 10:00am appointment 8 weeks ago. My hair was shredding this morning as I forced it once again into ponytails. It was time. At 9:41 I got the call from school. Jake threw up.. he actually ran to the bathroom himself and threw up into the toilet. So that's good right? I mean that he knew where to go, and then felt better and sat down in his chair next to his aide. So now it's 9:42am and I am trying to figure out whether I bag the hair appointment, disappointing myself, all of those who must look at my shredding hair, and of course all of those little hairs themselves who had so been looking forward to living a new life on the floor of the fancy salon. F*CK! F*ck! I do not want to go pick up Jake right now..in two hours, fine, but NOT RIGHT NOW. and of course then I feel like a total jerk wad, the cruelest mom in the world, because I do not want to miss out on my haircut?! What? Since when does  my hair come before my child? Apparently today? Spring break lasted 600 years. So...I called Pollyanna. No answer on any phone associated with her name.Damn. Damn. I called Sage. Sage, who works out of her home and would therefore need to stop focusing on her wee little clients to chat with me.. thank goodness she also did not pick up. Damn. Damn. Damn! Then I got a little bit close to weepy thinking \"I have no one.\" Which is  soooooo  not true, but you know how it just feels like that on some days, and lately a lot of days for me? Like I am just all alone hanging off a buoy in the middle of the Atlantic? or the Adriatic, but most likely the Pacific, because who really has the money to travel these days  anywhooo ? So I called Squid. I called precious Squid who was happily enjoying her first child-free morning in  weeks .   Like I said spring break lasted 600 years. I called her and (of course) she went and picked up my kid from ALL THE WAY ACROSS TOWN ( btw  I probably owe her like 6 bucks in gas for that alone). Then she went about her day and when I was done getting my \"do\" \"done\". She was patiently waiting at my house with my happy-to-be-home son. As it turns out, I am not alone. It feels good to not be alone. Also feels great to have had my hair cut...and also, I am quite a bit thankful that Jake did not throw up in Squid's car, and all over Mali. Thanks Squid. You're the  bestest . p.s. Jake is totally fine and probably threw up due to a double, perhaps triple full-fat milk course this morning, as Mommy and Daddy were both taking care of him and may have given in to the requests separately and sequentially. We normally do no more than 10 ounces of milk at a time, 'cause Mr. Jumpy jump can make his milk shake.. and 30 ounces apparently makes him barf.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/04/cross-hairs.html", "title": "\nCross Hairs\n"},

I decided to go through each major high school dance in my head; Homecoming, Winter Formal, Sadie Hawkins, Prom Spring Fling, anything I could remember. I tried very hard to remember my dress, my shoes, my hair, my corsage,  my date , who we went with and where the event was held. It was pretty funny to recall... Freshman year, Homecoming Dance: Red two piece strapless yarn-dyed tafetta with peplum, dyed-to match  very low  heels (last time I did that!), long (past my shoulders) blond wavy hair with bangs  like this  (almost exactly, Renee and I could have been sisters!), corsage two baby red roses with baby's breath, my date TOM TYLER! I am pretty sure we went with Nikki E. and Jill G and their dates (who I can't remember). I think we ate at a surf and turf, and someone (not my date) ordered the Phillet Mihg Non (Filet Mignon). I get through most of the dances and dresses, and nearly all of the dates (except the  senior who asked me to prom my freshman year..he was a nice guy, a swimmer I think with beautiful surfer blonde red hair). I figure out halfway through my reminiscing that I went to every major dance, and most of the other ones; perhaps another way to know that I haver always had a nice little life. Today I received an email from Gloria, my mom. It is a forward from the neighbor family I grew up next to. The older-sister's daughter was the flower girl in my wedding nearly ten years ago. The pictures attached to the email? They are from  my flower girl's  first high school formal. Whoomph. Wow. Okay. I was  JUST  there wasn't I? Apparently not.

We are the luckiest people in the entire world. My daughter likes to eat jelly straight out of the jar...and run around  nekkid . My son could live all day in the shower here. It is 5 feet by 7 feet with a soft-toned but well placed light imbuing the entire shower enclosure in a warm, cozy hue. ************************************ There is nothing open on Christmas day. Not in Newport Beach. We know this. We knew this, and yet somehow we still decided to \"go grab lunch\" instead of ordering room service again. I'm not sure why I was so price-resistant. I couldn't bear to spend 60 more dollars.. which is kind of silly because a) my parents are treating us and b) that's just about what lunch for four costs no matter where you go around here. We found a Chinese restaurant open on Balboa Island  RiceLand .  Lucy slept while Jake and Descartes and I ate Chinese food in the car. The we drove to the park near my mom's house to let Jake run around before he would be required not to. When we got to the park, Lucy was still sleeping so Descartes slept in the car too while Jake and I went over to the play area and scared all of the other parents there. I swear they were afraid their kids would \"catch\" whatever Jake had. I don't think we get as many stares in Deadwood City. Maybe I am used to my neighbors, or more confident, or Jake is more comfortable in his own zone so he looks more \"normal\", but these people were a little afraid I think of the gigantic 7 year old who was on the kiddie play structure in a little ball with his head twisted upside down (so he could look 'directly' at everything) making crazy  cookoo  noises. Don't forget that every once in a while he would hop up, make a big noise and run, hands at half staff flapping just a bit, and the sand from the top of his head flying everywhere. Got to overhear a great conversation about how none of them could live without their nannies and television to occupy their children. I am so looking forward to finding new help for Jake in the new year. *************************** My mom and dad's house looked beautiful, as it always does. It would be a beautiful house without anything in it, but they have exquisite taste and they both love Christmas so there are little  Christmasy  things everywhere and a gorgeous tree and bless them, a tent outside where the china and glassware gets set up and the door closed so the kids can still play in the family room. Descartes and I had already discussed asking my parents if Jake could open his presents before everyone else got there, and they were happy to accommodate. It was great. Lovely new flannel sheets, and a million other things, and the best present... from my step sister Sarsaparilla and James... three wind-up tops that you place on the ground, smack with your hand then they spin and light up with great colors. We all thought they were cool, and of course Jake loved them. She is always so thoughtful. You can tell she really searched for something age appropriate that he would enjoy. It is such a great feeling when people embrace your kids. Dinner was fantastic, Gerard made smoked  tri -tip, we had a ham  and scalloped potatoes and and sundry yums, and, of course, my favorite beverage--champagne. Jake went to sleep in the back bedroom, Lucy was precious and did NOT have the first melt-down of the evening... an all-around success for our little family. ************************** Late tonight I got to thinking about  Bubsy  putting out carrots for reindeer and milk and cookies for Santa last night. It was so precious and so painful to watch. Of course we have never had a kid who asked to do those things, and we never offered...  we never offered . Wow. That alone was enough to bring me to tears tonight, but let's add the fact that we have never spent a Christmas in our own house. Every Christmas of Jake's life we have been in Southern California. I am a firm believer that it should never matter where you are, but who you are with on any given day. My home is where Descartes and my kids are...but we never had a kid say \"How will Santa find me?\" or \"Can't we sleep at our house for Christmas?\"I think we may be at our own home next year. We can go to  SoCal  the weekend before Christmas and have that time with my family... or who knows, by this time next year I will have forgotten my tears on the balcony and just have memories of this beautiful view.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/R37-ugiK-cI/AAAAAAAAAok/_1FgCdKe_LY/s1600-h/1225070838a.jpg", "http://www.menuism.com/restaurants/d6DBmSjN8r24upabBlKsEs-riceland-newport-beach-ca"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2007/12/christmas-2007-part-two.html", "title": "\nChristmas 2007 Part Two\n"},

Basically, the extended release was wearing off as he got home from school leading to very rough afternoons.. rough like Jake couldn't sit for dinner, couldn't take a bath with his sister without kicking her, and couldn't follow any type of direction. We also saw tears, temper tantrums and, well he was just nearly beside himself every afternoon.It was the perfect storm..Jake has an expectation of how he feels all day, and it was gone, I have an expectation of how many directions he can follow, and he couldn't follow any, I am tired from being me all day, and, of course, we have \"the Four O Clocks\" at our house like any/all families do.  So we are now giving Jake 5 mg of a shorter release of the same med. Basically he is now in control of his emotions and his body until bed time. Phew.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/01/news-flash-woman-with-no-childcare.html", "title": "\nNews Flash: Woman with No Childcare Maintains Sanity\n"},
{"date": "03 January, 2008", "body": "\n Jake's MRI results came back .... NORMAL!    so that's good.. very very very good. There are apparently no abnormalities in his brain.    When he was younger, his first MRI showed that he had delayed myelenation. So I guess now his myelin is all caught up. That actually makes me a little sad. Isn't that odd? It is a moment of somber realization that, yup, he now has all of the right parts in all of the right places and he didn't catch up developmentally. That was a possibility I guess. I mean I wasn't holding my breath or anything, it was just a slice of possibilty. Squid  saw another perspective entirely, which  is that it is great news because now we know he doesn't have the hurdle of delayed myelin. She sees the possibility of  more  potential or something positive and hopeful. That's why it's good to have friends.

{"date": "25 November, 2007", "body": "\nOkay, so we got a babysitter for our four monkeys on Friday and decided to go to  Dory's Oar, Fremont Bistro Tudor pub. ..whatever you want to call it. We tried no less than four different tables when we arrived and went upstairs. We really couldn't get comfortable for some reason (is this foreshadowing?). It's a Tudor style building with a fancy pants new California cuisine restaurant downstairs and an\"English\" pub upstairs. The two parts of the restaurant do not mesh well at all, but we had had an okay time there recently and decided to try their tapas style dining one more time before calling the place a bust. We sat down and promptly drank an entire pitcher of Newcastle Ale. We ordered six small plates. We got another pitcher. The six small plates arrives and of the six, perhaps two were correct. The fried sweet potatoes turned out to be red new potatoes sliced and  sauteed  in a nasty red, vaguely spicy sauce. The artichoke dip in a bread bowl turned out to be a Mediterranean artichoke salad in a vinaigrette. The \"Spanish\" olives were straight from Costco. We tried to re-order. The waiter took the corrections and disappeared. The beer was gone. The food was dismal. I went to the bathroom. Down the front stairs, past the only exit, and through the white table cloth dining room. Just after I left the table, Descartes went down the back stairs to the men's room.  Jaster  and  Demanda  were upstairs at the table waiting for something, a beer, some decent food, anything. On my way out of the restroom I decided to go back up the front stairs instead of taking the much closer back stairwell...because I smelled something funny. I have a \"pregnancy\" nose. Even when I am not pregnant I can smell sour milk through a closed refrigerator door,  poopy  pants from the second floor of the house, a hint of almond in a cake before it hits my step-father's very allergic mouth. I can just smell stuff. I went past the pretentious bar, around the corner towards those front stairs and saw a billow of dark nasty smoke. A woman on a cell phone was standing near it  \"Oh,  Hmm  It looks like there is, like, a fire or something.\" and she continued talking. I threw open the front (and only) door of the building and lifted the new organza and other man-made material flammable curtains away from the fire and threw them over the door, both to prop it open and to keep them from catching fire. I revealed a newly varnished and highly-attractive wooden booth  aflame . When they did the recent remodel it appears that they built this booth  INTO  the wall atop of an actually *not* defunct wall heater. It was, as my sister calls it, \"butt-ass cold\" on Friday night, so the wall heater, in its forgotten, half-covered state decided to try to heat the damn place, and kicked on...and set fire to the booth and the wall in doing so. I paused for a millisecond. The flames were starting to leap up the wall a bit (and would have been in the curtains had Inot moved them). I yelled, \"There's a fire. Call 911. Get me some water.\" I turned around and grabbed a glass of water out of some one's hand and doused the base of the flames (I did try to avoid the heating element itself). I asked for more water. No one else was doing  anything . I went to the bar and yelled \"Get me some water, or call 911. It's your choice!\" A little whisper of a girl ran down the length of the bar (she was the bartender ?) and handed me a giant glass pitcher with about 20 ounces of water in it. I hip-checked some  idget , a stocky, stump of a man who was standing there drinking chardonnay, to move him out of my way, then I did my best to strategically throw it at the base of the remaining flames. It was smoldering now. I stuck my head in the kitchen window (right next to where I was standing). The men inside were still cooking. I said, as nicely as possible \"I know you're busy, and it's probably not your job, but there's a fire out here, and if you could please fill up that bin with water and hand it to me it would be very helpful.\" He did it without smiling or making eye contact, placed it on the other window and called out like it was an order up, \"water\". I threw that on it too. At some point during this, and between me tossing water, Descartes went back up the back stairs and found my sister who was letting everyone know that something smelled like fire, and probably they should all get out.  Jaster , Descartes and  Demanda  gathered up all of our coats and hats and bags and covered their faces and made their way down the front stairs through the thick smoke and out the door.   Demanda  put her hand out to me, but I was still putting out the fire. Descartes thought I was right behind him, realized I wasn't then came back in the door and said. \" Jennyalice . We are leaving.  C'mon .\" As it turns out, he was a bit irritated with me for standing there in the midst of the chaos... he didn't realize I had a purpose. He grabbed my hand and we went out into the parking lot and into the car. I told Descartes why I had been \"standing\" there. We drove off, hungry and reeking of chemical smoke. (The first person to our table thought we had been camping we smelled so bad!) We ended up at  Edgewood  Golf Club .  A beautiful space with friendly service and amazing delicious food. We spent probably the same amount of money we would have at the pub, but drank champagne and had lobster bisque instead. The strangest part of the evening for me.. and the part I can't really get over... We skipped out on our bill. I have never skipped out on a bill in my life... even when abandoned by wait staff, we have always figured out about how much we owe.

I know she is fine, but not having her greet us at the car makes me a little lost.. I can't imagine how it feels for Jake!

I never expected that I would be in a 4X4,  dodging trees and crawling over rocks.  I always saw myself doing those things with a pack on my back and boots on my feet. I think I used to look down on people who \"went 4x4ing\", as if they were lazy or something. Once again I realize that you just never know why people do the things they do, just when you begin to pass judgement, well, life with Jake has changed us in so many ways. We still go camping, but hiking on rocks and boulders up and down steep hillsides is not happening (maybe it wouldn't anyway with a near 7 year old?) and now I find that  I  am one of  them . and by the way it is really fun and requires a crazy amount of mind agility to figure out angles and such.

But, according to new research, cradling could help identify stress that may lead to postnatal depression. New mothers who cradle their infants on the right side of their body may be displaying signs of \"extreme stress\". The findings build on previous research showing that most mothers prefer to hold their baby to their left, regardless of whether they are left- or right-handed. The study suggests there is a correlation between the minority who hold a baby on the right and a greater likelihood that they are experiencing stress beyond the levels natural in new parents. The researchers say the finding could provide a new way to tackle postnatal depression, suffered by at least one in 10 new mothers. They conclude: \"Studying non-verbal cues such as baby-cradling could help doctors and health visitors identify which mothers need extra professional support before it gets too late.\" Depression in mothers can have a detrimental effect on the baby's mental development. The study, published in the online edition of the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, was based on 79 new mothers and their babies. Mothers in their own homes were asked to cradle their babies, an action not linked to left- or right-handedness. They were also quizzed on their mental state. The study found that of the mothers who expressed no stress or depression only 14% preferred to hold their babies to the right. But 32% of stressed mothers showed a right-sided bias. Lead author Nadja Reissland, a senior lecturer with Durham University's department of psychology, said early detection of stress was vital. \"The way they [new mothers] interact with their child is usually the best indicator of their inner mental state,\" she said. Gillian Fletcher, president of the National Childbirth Trust, said the apparent link between cradling side and mental state was interesting, but she would view it with caution in terms of predicting depression.

{"date": "03 September, 2007", "body": "\nRecently I had the nicest out-of-the-blue email from a school chum I have known since the first day of first grade. We were mostly close friends all through school, only drifting apart due to differing focuses (she on school, me on singing and boys and working). She is one of those people who is brilliant, so smart she just sort of 'hums'. She is a good person, with a gentle spirit. She is one of those intelligent people who doesn't need to make other people feel stupid. A quality I am sure she has honed as an adult. She is a natural teacher; so many things come easily for her, but instead of being frustrated by others' lack of knowledge, she has the patience and ability to teach others and help them see what she can see. Obviously, a girl and woman I have always admired. \n \nWell, as it turned out, she thought I was okay too. A mutual-admiration society of sorts. She said she thought I was nice all through school, when other girls turned caddy she says I didn't, and she had these very strong memories of me being a kind person, and even defending her when other girls were speaking harshly behind her back (while she was pretending to be asleep at a slumber party). \n \nIt was truly a remarkable email for me to receive, because I do not do a very good job of remembering anything good I ever do. When asked recently if I hold a grudge I replied no.. My husband said, \"Well, but you do remember every single thing anyone ever says\". and I think that is true. But I don't hold a grudge, instead I just remember every mean or unkind, or misplaced word which has ever been spoken to me; every criticism, harshness or otherwise. Sadly, most of the time I also dissect the statement so carefully that it goes beyond a phrase and becomes a diatribe or dissertation in my head. It's not a 'grudge'.. I just remember being 'smudged'. \n \nWhat was so interesting to me is that the here was this person who spent time near me for 12+ years thinking I was a certain type of person, and I was there too, all that time, thinking I was someone else. I was trying so hard to be the kind of person she describes, but never felt like I was. How does that happen? In this case it is much better to use her perceptions to define my young self. I like the idea that I was kind, and gracious and good hearted etc. \n \nI think, as my Momster says  \"We become the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves\" . So what stories am I feeding myself now? What poet's lines? When one of my dearest friends tells me one night in January 2004 after many, many, many drinks, \"You have a mean heart\"-- is that the perception I had been wearing? do I still wear it? I spend every day trying to be anything but that girl. \n \nI try to tell myself that I am a woman who is starting to have a grip on who she is. I want to think that I am a devoted wife, a good mother, and an aspiring writer. I'd like to think that I am witty and that I am a critical thinker who still has compassion and common sense. I tell myself that I love to go camping, I regularly compost and that this body I live in isn't so bad after all. \n \nThese are the stories I am telling myself these days.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2007/09/question-of-heart.html", "title": "\nA Question of the Heart\n"},

I am going to perfect the design and sell it...basically Jake is attached to me  and  Jake can have his hand at his side. It is adjustable for Descartes. Jake was bugged a bit at first, but was much, much more relaxed for the (quick) grocery store run. I talked with him about how it may be uncomfortable, but it was still a lot more comfortable than holding mommy's hand the entire time. I was so ready for evil looks from people, and you know what? Only three people noticed. Two of those were little twin boys about Jake's age...and frankly I think they started looking at us because Lucy kept saying \"Hi buh, Hi Buh\" which is \"Hi boys\". The only other person was a 40 something year old woman who gave me a look like a therapist seeing a good tool would look. Sort of \"Oh. Wow. That is a very simple fix to a very complex social, behavioral and developmental issue.\" I am so glad I finally sucked it up and tried it. I have been so terrified that I would need to decide which kid to \"save\"..and I'm sure I will still think some of that, but it is nice to know that I won't need to chase Jake around a Safeway store.

I did need to watch his toes on the cart wheels and his hands on the products on the shelves. .but no mishaps and got all of the things we needed.

{"date": "11 June, 2007", "body": "\nWe went to Lake Tahoe this weekend to celebrate Lucy's first birthday and to baptize her in style. We went to  Baldwin beach  for a full dunking, but since the water was \"headache cold\" we only poured water over her forehead. She wore a beautiful and very formal dress made lovingly by Descartes' mom, Cookie.  It actually fit her perfectly... even though it was made before she was even born! Cookie and Papa drove their RV and stayed at a very nice campground not too far from my sister's house. They were very sweet to somehow get it together in spite of having just returned from The East Coast via D.C. and Miami. They were mighty jet-lagged, but managed to happily blend in with the rest of my crazy family. It is actually not fair to say that they are crazy.. not this time. It all went so smoothly. I am really very very lucky to have such a great, if complicated family. My Mom and Step-dad wonderfully put up my family and my brother's family in a hotel we all thought was going to be amazing.. but it was really just a Caesar's palace with a  name-change .. None the less my children acted like it was Christmas and had a grand time on the cozy beds and in the Gigantic two person tub (as long as you ignored the slime mold it was fine!) Gloria and P.J. were generous as always, and I so appreciated that they drove all that way. Gerard and Pinky and my precious niece, Bubsy were great to have in attendance since they do not often travel outside of the Southern California basin (except to go to Hawaii or Mexico). I actually think it was the first time either of them had been to Tahoe..perhaps even north of Fresno! Bubsy really enjoyed playing in the jump house with Jake, and taking a bath with Lucy. BIAD and my step-mom, Monster (by the way, not a deriding term.. I am Step-brat.. although this may be a more accurate name)stayed with my sister along with my youngest brother Albert and a friend Monster brought with her from work, Kory. She was delightful and a tremendous help with all of the kids. We figured out that this was the first time all four kids have been in the same place since Demanda and Jaster's wedding in 1999. How sad is that? Someone has always been away at school or sick, or dying, or grieving, or poor or angry. We were really only all in the same place for about 6 hours, but it was nice. Jaster and Demanda have re-organized and arranged their entire house to make it work with two little babies.. and they were amazing hosts for Lucy's birthday weekend acting as a home base for everyone.  I thanked them about a million times, but there is never quite enough thanks I could give someone who actually takes care of me. Between Gloria and P.J. arranging for my hotel, Cookie making the dress and Demanda and Jaster setting up their entire house, I really didn't need to worry about anything. It felt so nice to have someone make some decisions and make it so I didn't need to anticipate every single need all by myself. By the way Jaster and Demanda's house is still ready for Jake at a moment's notice. They continue to provide a sanctuary for my family time and time again. So the weekend, overall went very smoothly. I am very proud of everyone for playing nicey-nice and  I think  enjoying themselves. Will post a few pictures if I can get some from someone else.. since we could not get it together  enough to bring our own camera. oh got one....\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.aboutlaketahoe.com/beaches/baldwin_beach.htm", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/Rm9-YshXzKI/AAAAAAAAAPE/cV4HKRx8pWo/s1600-h/IMG_0908+%28Small%29.JPG", "http://www.montbleuresort.com/"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2007/06/sprinkle-dont-dunk.html", "title": "\nSprinkle don't dunk\n"},

{"date": "12 February, 2007", "body": "\nI know it may seem like no big deal, but today my entire family ate the same lunch.  Cooking  will now be much easier going forward. It is also one of those moments when you realize that your \"new baby\" isn't so new anymore. Lucy is 8 months old now. And while she only has 1 1/2 teeth, she is already a chow hound eating a tuna melt for lunch today and pizza last night for dinner. I think most people were worried that if we had a second child Jake would somehow injure me while I was pregnant, or that Jake would hurt a tiny new baby. Well Jake, as it turns out is the nicest big brother on the planet and we have not had even one scary incident betwixt the kids.  Now I really do wonder why we waited so long to have another child. Fear is so powerful. Fear may be even more powerful if you are on the smarter or more creative side of life. With fear, your amazing intellect can conjure up all sorts of bad things that \"could\" happen. Like  my father,  I am able to create fantastic scenarios then with each horrible thing I imagine,  I create the contingency plan that saves my baby, my family, my friends, the dogs, the house, the car, the planet..what or whomever lies in peril. It is exhausting. It also means that I have tennis shoes under my bed, rope in the car, Jake's bus vest and a leash with which to tether him at the back door, extra towels in the laundry room, spare cell phones and more than 50 batteries of all shape and size.

{"date": "22 August, 2006", "body": "\n Autism linked to delayed brain development - health - 21 August 2006 - New Scientist Autism may be the result of a delay in neuronal development in the first year of life, despite the fact that autistic children have larger brains, a new study suggests. The findings challenge a previously held theory that brain abnormalities characteristic of autism were due to faster development. Brain scans, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have shown that children with autism have brains that are enlarged by around 10%. However, although the children\u2019s brains are larger in size, they appear to lack the neuronal development of healthy children, the researchers say. Stephen Dager at the University of Washington School of Medicine, US, and colleagues examined the brains of children aged three and four. They compared the brain development of children with autism to children with normal development using a technique known as T2 relaxation, which measures the water properties of brain tissue. As the brain develops, water gets incorporated into neurons and changes from being mobile to tightly bound. During normal development, this process occurs at a dramatic pace for the first six months, and then continues at a slower pace until 18 months. Critical stages Surprisingly, they found that water was more mobile in autistic brain tissue, suggesting that there is actually a delay in neuronal development. This delay was found to be more specific to grey matter distributed at the surface of the brain. The delay could be cause by inflammation in the first year of life, Dager suggests. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got inflammation, it can affect connectivity at a critical stage of brain development.\u201d This may lead to learning difficulties as the child develops, he suggests. \u201cFor example, a child has certain key developmental stages for learning language and if you miss those it can be harder to learn that language.\u201d Some children may have a gene that makes them more likely to produce an inflammatory response early in life, Dager speculates. Gene hunt \u201cI think these results are an interesting development, but most research still has no direct link to treatment,\u201d says Matthew Belmonte, senior research associate at the Autism Research Centre at the University of Cambridge in the UK. \u201cUntil we know exactly what it is that causes the abnormal development of grey matter we cannot develop drug treatments,\u201d he adds. Current research has focused on finding candidate genes that might cause rapid early development, but Dager\u2019s study suggests that other avenues of research could be more appropriate. \u201cOne might look at genes that cause a susceptibility to inflammation instead,\u201d he says.

{"date": "25 September, 2005", "body": "\nI don't know how appropriate it is for me to post on this site the obituary of a woman I have never met, but I was moved by what was written about her life. I am a fatalist of sorts? And have often thought \"What will be said of me when I am gone?\" wondering what legacy I will leave, since most days I feel like I am merely going through the motions, that perhaps I am merely equal to a tree going through the seasons and nothing more. I hope that someone might think this fondly of me.  STEPHENS, Phyllis Bartlett - Phyllis Bartlett Stephens passed away in her sleep on September 10th. Given the life she led and the energy she exuded, it could fairly be said she has passed on to a well-deserved rest. As her mother often said of her, Phyllis was a dutiful, hard-working, caring and intelligent human being from that day in May, 1925 when she was born. The Central Valley was not big enough for Phyllis and shortly after her salutatory address to her Corcoran High classmates in 1943, she left for Stanford. While there, in addition to her dutiful attention to the honor roll, she met a gangly, mediocre pre-med student named Richard Stephens. They continued to date after graduation and in 1948 were married. One year later to the day, the first of their eight children arrived. Over the next 56 years, Phyllis gave herself to raising and supporting her children and grandchildren. But of course, she had energy to spare and an intellect that needed exercise. Her many activities included over 20 years in the San Mateo School system, volunteer work at St. Vincent DePaul, the St. Francis Center, Friends of the Belmont Library, \"Friendship House\" of San Mateo County Mental Health, AAUW, Twin Pines Cottage and many other groups. She also slipped in some bridge playing. Phyllis also managed to make time for simple statements of her basic beliefs and humanity - whether marching in Delano with central valley farm workers or riding the annual MLK Freedom Train into the City, she was always there to show her support for those not given the love and respect they deserved. Perhaps more than any other, Phyllis devoted her energies to the Immaculate Heart of Mary parish in Belmont. Her sense of community, based on love, honesty and acceptance (and more than a little humor), was nowhere better illustrated than in her time spent with family and friends at the many parish events held over the past 50 years. Whether she was serving up pancakes in the Parish Hall, or playing the role of Diamond Lil' in the melodrama, she supported and cavorted with her IHM friends and enjoyed every minute of it. Phyllis would no doubt bristle at the suggestion that her \"community service\" activities were worthy of praise. To her, these were just things people did because they were the right thing to do. She never sought recognition and she rarely, if ever, complained. Perhaps Phyllis' greatest accomplishment in helping others was being able take from it as much as she gave. She understood and appreciated that the love and attention she provided to others less fortunate than her would come back to her in equal measure. The love she gave to her mental health patients or the people at St. Francis', to name a few, could never surpass the love and pleasure she felt in return. And that is Phyllis' legacy. She not only talked about love, fairness, tolerance and Christianity, she lived them every day of her life. Her example will live on in the lives and work of her family and friends. Phyllis leaves behind a loving husband, seven children and their spouses, and 13 grandchildren (and thankfully, her recipes for Aunt Gussie's Pound Cake and her famous brownies). While she will be missed, her family feels very lucky to have spent their lives with Phyllis, and all of them are very proud to call her their wife, mother or grandmother. If desired, Phyllis would have encouraged and appreciated donations to the St. Francis Center, 101 Buckingham Ave, Redwood City, CA, 94063. Services have not yet been scheduled.

Jake has thrown four major temper tantrums today...or make that .. all day has been one big temper tantrum. I don't think school is going well for him. He's increasingly frustrated by his inability to communicate (which is also a good sign). But he is really, really unable to handle going out.... doing errands, anything. Okay maybe it is just today, but lately it has felt like any time we want to go to dinner with Jake we are so miserable by the end of the interaction that we vow never to set foot in a restaurant again. This is so frustrating because Jake loves to eat. It is the one skill he has always continued to develop right along with his peers. He has always been so happy to go to a restaurant and sit with mom and dad and eat... it started to get difficult about a year ago when he became more independent, and honestly, he makes a bit of a mess so sometimes it is tricky or costs us more in tips to take him out, but it has always been something our family can do together that is  normal . Jake has eaten in some of the finest restaurants in California. And now.. just as all of his peers, other 5 year old, are gaining the ability to have table manners and actually sit still through a dinner...our kid can't do it. He just cannot sit there and eat without throwing things or running around. Okay this has nothing to do with eating at a restaurant. The truth is..I just realized that I spend at least 18 hours a day at my house currently because Jake can't handle the outside world.

Brady Briefing Room  12:44 P.M July 13, 2005 EDT  MR. McCLELLAN:  ...And with that, I'm glad to go to your questions.  Q  Scott, some White House advisors expressed surprise that the President didn't -- did not give a warm endorsement to  Karl Rove  when he was asked about him at the Cabinet meeting. They had expected that he would speak up. Can you explain why the President didn't give a -- express confidence?  MR. McCLELLAN:  Sure. He wasn't asked about his support or confidence for  Karl . As I indicated yesterday, every person who works here at the White House, including  Karl Rove , has the confidence of the President. This was not a question that came up in the Cabinet Room.  Q  Well, the President has never been restrained at staying right in the lines of a question, as you know. (Laughter.) He kind of -- he says whatever he wants. And if he had wanted to express confidence in Karl Rove, he could have. Why didn't he?  MR. McCLELLAN:  He expressed it yesterday through me, and I just expressed it again.  Q  Well, why doesn't he?  MR. McCLELLAN:  He was not asked that specific question, Terry. You know that very well. The questions he were asked -- he was asked about were relating to an ongoing investigation.  Q  But, Scott, he defended Al Gonzales without even being asked --  MR. McCLELLAN:  I'll come to you in a second. I'll come to you in a second. Go ahead.  Q  Yes, he defended Al Gonzales without ever being asked. (Laughter.) Ed brings up a good point. Didn't he?  MR. McCLELLAN:  No, I think he was asked about the Attorney General.  Q  Scott, you know what, to make a general observation here, in a previous administration, if a press secretary had given the sort of answers you've just given in referring to the fact that everybody who works here enjoys the confidence of the President, Republicans would have hammered them as having a kind of legalistic and sleazy defense. I mean, the reality is that you're parsing words, and you've been doing it for a few days now. So does the President think Karl Rove did something wrong, or doesn't he?  MR. McCLELLAN:  No, David, I'm not at all. I told you and the President told you earlier today that we don't want to prejudge the outcome of an ongoing investigation. And I think we've been round and round on this for two days now.  Q  Even if it wasn't a crime? You know, there are those who believe that even if Karl Rove was trying to debunk bogus information, as Ken Mehlman suggested yesterday -- perhaps speaking on behalf of the White House -- that when you're dealing with a covert operative, that a senior official of the government should be darn well sure that that person is not undercover, is not covert, before speaking about them in any way, shape, or form. Does the President agree with that or not?  MR. McCLELLAN:  Again, we've been round and round on this for a couple of days now. I don't have anything to add to what I've said the previous two days.  Q  That's a different question, and it's not round and round --  MR. McCLELLAN:  You heard from the President earlier.  Q  It has nothing to do with the investigation, Scott, and you know it.  MR. McCLELLAN:  You heard from the President earlier today, and the President said he's not --  Q  That's a dodge to my question. It has nothing to do with the investigation. Is it appropriate for a senior official to speak about a covert agent in any way, shape, or form without first finding out whether that person is working as a covert officer.  MR. McCLELLAN:  Well, first of all, you're wrong. This is all relating to questions about an ongoing investigation, and I've been through this.  Q If I wanted to ask you about an ongoing investigation, I would ask you about the statute, and I'm not doing that.  MR. McCLELLAN:  I think we've exhausted discussion on this the last couple of days.  Q  You haven't even scratched the surface.  Q  It hasn't started.  MR. McCLELLAN:  I look forward to talking about it once the investigation is complete, as the President does, as well. And you heard from the President earlier today.  Q  Can I ask for clarification on what the President said at Sea Island on June 10th of last year, when he was saying that he would fire anybody from the White House who was involved in the leak of classified information? What were the parameters for those consequences? Was it --  MR. McCLELLAN:  I appreciate your question.  Q  Was it a knowing leak with the intent of doing damage? I'm just wondering when he talked about that, what those parameters were?  MR. McCLELLAN:  Again, I've nothing to add on this discussion, and if we have any other topics you want to discuss, I'll be glad to do that.  Go ahead, David.  Q  Scott, when the President asked that question at Sea -- was asked that question at Sea Island, and, in fact, when you made your statement that Karl had had nothing to do with this, was there an ongoing investigation at that time?  MR. McCLELLAN:  Again, we've been through this for two days now, and I've already responded to those questions.  Go ahead, April.  Q  I'm going to give you another --  Q  I'm sorry, I wasn't here yesterday, so could you refresh my memory? Was there an ongoing investigation --  MR. McCLELLAN:  The briefings are available online.  Q  -- at the time that you answered previous questions on this issue?  MR. McCLELLAN:  Again, I responded to those questions the past couple of days. Go ahead.  Q  The answer is, yes.  Q  I'm going to go to another question, somewhat on the same subject, but a different vein. Let's talk about the Wilson family. Is there any regret from this White House about the effects of this leak on this family?  MR. McCLELLAN:  We can continue to go round and round on all these --  Q  No, no, no, no. This has nothing to do with the investigation. This is about the leak and the effects on this family. I mean, granted there are partisan politics being played, but let's talk about the leak that came from the White House that affected a family.  MR. McCLELLAN:  And let me just say again that anything relating to an ongoing investigation, I'm not going to get into discussing. I've said that the past couple of days.  Q  This is not -- this is about -- this is a personal -- this is not about the -- I mean about the investigation. This is about the personal business of this family, an American family, a taxpaying family, a family that works for the government of the United States. And the executive branch -- someone in the executive branch let this family down in some kind of way, shape, or form. Is there any regret from the White House that this family was affected by the leak?  MR. McCLELLAN:  It doesn't change what I just said.

We have neglected to curb our language in the house, perhaps because we never thought we would need to, perhaps because this life is just  a leetle bit  more difficult than one might imagine. Either way.. it finally happened.  Jake is a potty mouth. In the cafeteria at school today he is sitting with Anna, his aide, and the other children. Many of his classmates eat the school lunch, so I guess everyone had oranges today. I sent Jake to school with strawberries, so he didn't have oranges, but seeing that all of the other children had them, he wanted some. So he kept reaching for everyone else's oranges, and he kept getting told \"no\", then they find him his own orange, but Anna still needs to peel it, so he keeps grabbing and gets told to \"be patient\". Apparently he got a  leetle bit  frustrated, and turned his head down and to the side (towards Anna) and said quietly but firmly... \" Fuck . \" Okay then. So I got a call from the teacher who, by the way is very proud of Jake because he used the word in its appropriate context! We had a discussion and my theory is this: there is no such thing as a \"bad\" word. We make words bad or good or meaningful by the way we say them and where we say them and where we aim them. Just like playing with your genitals is not bad, it just shouldn't be done on the bus, or even in the living room. If a kid needs to explore their body.. hey--go to the bathroom or a bedroom.  No discipline for using the word, just gonna remind him that saying that particular word at school is not okay, but saying it in his room when no one else is around, that might be okay.  And saying it when you drop a giant rock on your toe, or if you get shot in the leg.. it might be okay then too.  Just like saying \"shit\" after your kid's teacher tells you the story.

Also.. he  will  be 5 years old in October, not really a question for the cut-off. The hard thing is that I thought we had another year of preschool. When the director of the school asked me to come to the kindergarten transition meeting, I thought it was to show support (I am the PTA president.. scary huh?) Then I realized she wanted us there because we were transitioning. In truth that is what is really happening. Jake doesn't care if he goes to kindergarten. I mean, of course he will miss his teachers and paraeducaters at ECE, but he will probably be thrilled to hang out on a campus with a bunch of \"typical\" kids and kids who are bigger than he is. I was very angry when I found out, at what felt like the last minute, that he was not going to have another year of preschool as all of our friends had. Mostly, I realized that I was just not prepared. I apologized later to the director for my curt behavior. I never go into something unprepared. Even when I am unprepared (which I truly often am) I go in  knowing  what I haven't done. I know what I don't know. So if I haven't written a speech, at least know I will need to wing it (not generally a problem for me to talk now is it?) This time I was really,  really  not ready. I hadn't done my research, I didn't know what questions to ask, who the players were. Okay, let's keep in mind that this is transitioning a special-ed kid into a new special-ed classroom, probably staying at the county level. This is actually nothing close to brain surgery, or the quagmire that many of our friends face as they decide which is better,  the German School  or  the French school  or should the kid stay in public school? This is just one kid, but I was unprepared. Mostly I was unprepared for the grieving. I understand  intellectually  that Jake is a special needs child. He will probably be in a special day class at the county level for years, if not forever. I am intimately aware of his functional delays; and yet, here we are, about to send our child to kindergarten in the fall. Did I think he was going to be \"better\" by now? Hmmm. I guess somehow, at some point, some small kernel must have formed in my head that he really was going to \"snap out of it\". This is an inside joke in our family. Just like \"he has a touch of  CP \"...and well, we haven't come up with one about the autism thing, because maybe hasn't been \"officially diagnosed as  autistic .  We should really get on that, in case we need it; I know that piece of paper is coming soon. Basically I am crushed. I knew it was coming. I knew that he was not going to walk to the local school for kindergarten. I knew that he would not, as I had, be reading books before his first day, that he would not probably help choose new clothes to wear to school, or help me write his name on his notebook. I  knew  that. When you have a child with special needs, you grieve a little bit all of the time, and a lot a bit some of the time. Maybe there are people who are better than I am. Well, I'm sure of that, but I know there are those parents who think their special needs kid is \"God's precious gift\". I know they are out there. I have met them with their nicey-niceness. Yeah, well, my kid is certainly a gift, but I still think he would be special if he could sing me the alphabet song. And besides, aren't all kids God's precious gift? Or just the ones who wait until they're nearly three to walk? Sorry. I am sad. That's it. Because we have reached another rite of passage, and once again it is not what we expected. And I wasn't prepared to grieve yet. I thought I had a whole other year to prepare myself for that feeling. And please, don't  even  tell me about  Holland . Please. I'll be okay, Jake will be fine. This is no big deal. Now taking him to the dentist next week... that  is going to be a big deal.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/", "http://www.blogger.com/www.germanamericanschool.org/", "http://www.istp.org/", "http://www.blogger.com/www.ucp.org/", "http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/autism.cfm", "http://www.our-kids.org/Archives/Holland.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2005/06/oh-cry-me-riverits-just-kindergarten.html", "title": "\nOh Cry Me A River...It's just Kindergarten\n"},

As if there weren't enough distrust in the system and blame, and no one is taking care of people etc... now we have this guy saying we should really put our money in the right place and 'do something real' I think the suggestion was something like uhm make dinner for them. So I guess if we want to get together over here and make some macaroni salad, and can you cook up a few pies..and we'll mail them to Louisiana?

My kid's bus comes at 7:28 am...which by the way..also bugs me. Here's my post to the SLJ website... I am just wondering if you really meant to bash the  Red Cross   when you were on the John Stewart Show? I understand that if someone has millions of dollars, perhaps that one person could really set up a meal for 400 or 4000 people, or rent out the hotel etc... but what about the thousands of people who can give just $25.00?  Don't you think that an organization that is so well equipped and has such a strong infrastructure in the U.S., not to mention reasonable overhead, might be a great way for the average American to help the many people hit by this disaster? I was saddened by your remarks, especially since you reiterated them, so it did appear to be a direct attack. Nearly every relief organization, religious or secular has overhead. If you have a suggestion on how a person in Fresno, or Omaha can buy dinner for someone in New Orleans without the use of infrastructure please pass it on to the rest of us.

They have a position open for the fund development manager. I wish I had enough time ( and probably some more experience) so that I could do this job. I think that is one of my long term goals. I really only have two things left I need to do...become a published author ( I really don't think this counts), and open a wine tasting bar. Somehow along the way I think I would be good at working in the development department of a charity. I had a taste of it when I did some work for  Children's Health Council in Palo Alto . Jake was in therapy there at the time, so it was a good fit. Maybe you can't be a charity case and be the development manager; maybe a nut case, but not the actual beneficiary of the philanthropic work. I will have to think on that a bit As for the published author part, I am working on my book, but it is hard to find the time to write about being a parent of a special needs kid when you actually  are  a parent of a special needs kid. We celebrated Jake's birthday today at   Four Seasons San Francisco Hotel . A lot of my family from Southern California was in town for the USC vs. Stanfurd game. USC defeated Stanfurd, and we all went to Bucca di Beppo for dinner in Palo Alto on Saturday night. Today's lunch was held in the  private dining room  at Seasons restaurant. It was really lovely. Of course Jake got a bit too excited and got ice cream all over Grandma's new St. John's Knit oops. My in-laws made their way over from Berkeley, and a good time was had by all. I mean we did have lunch until 4pm.

I know that it is posted on the World Wide Web, but I don't think anyone else had ever read it... *********************** My dad just called and wanted to know if I had seen the Christmas Ducks. I said, \"I have never seen any Christmas Ducks\". and he said, \"Yes, you have, they come out every year for you. AND I had saved them for you. AND now when we open the box, we can't find the Christmas Ducks.\" \"Maybe Demanda  took them.\" I say  jokingly . \"No, Jennyalice. Demanda did NOT take the Christmas ducks.\" Demanda is my sister, and was prone to liberating items for her personal use from me as a teenager. \"Maybe Jaster?\" Who is my sister's husband, and a pastor, and not prone to stealing things. \"No. Jennyalice,  no one stole the Christmas ducks from you. Do you want a Noah's ark? It is filled with animals.\" \"Is it made of wood?\", \"Are the animals inside made of wood?\" I ask, keenly, oddly, interested \"Yes, they are.\" \"Yes, please dad. That would be lovely. Wait, where on earth are you?\" Is he out shopping? I don't need anyone to BUY me anything. Finding something fine, but buying, spending hard earned cash on me... not okay. \"I'm at home. I bought all of these things for my children. For Christmas, but we don't celebrate any more.\" I think how sad this statement is. It is so true, we have such a hard time gathering as a group anymore. Toys stay in their original boxes, never even looked at before being stored in the attic. Perhaps later we'll find them and sell them on eBay for double there original price. He keeps buying things for us, for my son... but things are so distant, we don't even know these treasures exist. \"Demanda will bring you a Noah's ark.\" You will each have one, but yours will be better.\" He says this seriously. I think he believes I really was hurt that my step-sister got his grandmother's old 1940's radio, art deco wicker chair and various sundry items. I guess I was hurt enough to notice, but not by the gesture that she would have the items. Not at all. She is my sister in ways that blood would never confirm. Sisters by choice is a lot better than sisters by chance. No, I was hurt because I did not have the ability to visit his house and see his treasures... family treasures, family history. Cut off by distance, and time and lack of money and allergies and engine trouble and all sorts of stooopid things I have managed to withdraw from my life in Southern California so completely that I no longer even get the hand-me-down bed Gloria (my mom, the one who carried me) is giving to my little brother (the one by blood, Gerard), or the beautiful wicker rocker Demanda has in her guest room. I am not more deserving than any of the other kids, more appreciative or even by a longshot, a better kid... it's just, well, I am not even offered the items anymore.

{"date": "13 July, 2004", "body": "\nCompleted the   AVON Walk for Breast Cancer  this last weekend in San Francisco with my dear friend Bridquet. The good news is that the walking was not difficult at all for me. It was actually hanging out with all of the people. It was really quite like a sorority...all the tchotchke stuff and the pink and the special hats and t-shirts. We made our shirts at  Custon Ink  I guess I got carried away... they said \"Save the Boobies\" with a pink ribbon. They really were very cute.... I thought it would put me more in the mood. Basically I think that I would crew the event..or I would raise money for the event, but I just don't think I ever want to be on the receiving end of \"GOOD JOB WALKERS!\" EVER EVER again. I know they meant well....and perhaps if I were actually a breast cancer survivor I would have felt more 'proud' to be walking...but honestly I just don't think walking is all that hard for me. It was hard to raise $1910 dollars ( actually not that hard at all. I have very generous friends) AND I suppose it IS true that probably none of them would have just given me the money to donate if they didn't think I was working hard on something ( though many thought that it was a good cause whether I walked or not.) I just didn't think I was very remarkable for  walking .  It was all just sort of weird and odd. I am still glad I did it, but I am not glad that the woman in the tent next to me was so important that she had to manage 6 business calls in a loud voice from her tent at 3am. Apparently she works for Citibank...and she is very important....she must be very very important for people to call her at three in the morning about an alarm going off at a place where they are actually doing construction, so the alarm shouldn't even have been set. I know all of this because she did not exactly keep her voice down..despite being in the midst of about 1800 sleeping people.

I have an education, from a  good school  even, I have had a great career at a Fortune 500 company. I have started my own consulting business, and yet, I am at a constant loss as to how best to go about this business of being my kid's mom.

SO glad that I worked my mind and problem solved, and read great literature and met amazing people, that I traveled and have foreign language and worked while I did all of those things.. because I can be such a better advocate for my child...because I have worked with arrogant people before (I liken CEOs and neurologists to be of a similar breed) , I have dealt with financial aide to get through school (so similar to the medi-Cal office... except I really wish I had taken Spanish now).. and because I have had financial freedom, and world travel, I do not feel like I am stuck and have never had anything or been anywhere, like so many parents...especially parents of special needs kids feel. I have tasted that life, I know what it looks like and we will do all of those things again... we might wait until the kid can walk a bit better rather than take a wheelchair across cobblestone and up elevators too small to hold us and our packs, but we will do it again. We were good at it together then, the hubbins and I ... and we will be even better the kiddo.  Anyway, I can't seem to keep my head down and work. I am trying, but as a consultant I don't have the same time pressures, and because my time is my own... here in a little cubby at an office, I feel so fantastic, I hardly want to work on something so banal as a policy manual.

How do we keep our nation safe but our schools well-stocked? I think we can do both; can't we? I actually think the two party system is failing us; it automatically pits one side against the other. My husband laughs, but I still think the best way to run the country would be to have the winner be the president and the second-up guy be the vice president. Then no one would really be able to bad mouth each other, and the debates might be about something relevant rather than whether or not Bush was a wussy draft dodger and Kerry threw medals and ribbons, or just ribbons, or just medals, and if he was right to protest the war at all. My brother Gerard  just informed me that he is not going to vote. I think that's shameful, but didn't exactly use those words to tell him that. He is disenfranchised for sure... and is adamant that all politicians do is \"lie to get your vote\", then do \"whatever they want\" once they are in the White House. Yikes. I am not quite that cynical, but I suppose I am close. I just can't imagine listening to Kerry's voice for four or eight years.. and I'm positive I can't stand anymore un-ed-yew-ma-cated (although remarkably well-lettered) George Dubbyew. But politics is kind of like when my husband and I go to the movies: After finding a babysitter, selecting a film, spending too much money for a cramped seat, we are invariably disappointed with the picture. We talk about it later , but what we always come to is... \"What exactly, at this point,  would  please us?\" We have low expectations of actually being  thrilled  by a movie, even then we are let down. Okay so how does  that  tie in? Well, I guess I just don't know who could meet my expectations for the White House. I suppose I do want \"The West Wing\". Or at least the first couple of seasons. The best part about it? Well, when the audience doesn't like what it sees on the tele, the writers make adjustments to the president's actions.... hmmm now there's a thought...

If I had my life to live over again, I\u2019d try to make more mistakes next time. I wouldn\u2019t try to be so perfect. We all have perfection fetishes. What difference does it make if you let people know you are imperfect? They can identify with you then. Nobody can identify with perfection. I would relax more. I\u2019d limber up. I\u2019d be sillier than I\u2019ve been on this trip. In fact, I know few things that I would take so seriously. I\u2019d be crazier. I\u2019d be less hygienic. I\u2019d take more chances. I\u2019d take more trips. I\u2019d climb more mountains. I\u2019d swim in more rivers. I\u2019d watch more sunsets. I\u2019d go more places I\u2019ve never seen. I\u2019d eat more ice cream and fewer beans. I\u2019d have more actual problems and fewer imaginary ones. You see, I was one of those people who lived sensibly and sanely hour after hour and day after day. Oh, I\u2019ve had my moments, and if I had it to do all over again, I\u2019d have more of those moments. In fact, I\u2019d try to have nothing but beautiful moments, moment by moment by moment. In case you didn\u2019t know it, that\u2019s the stuff life is made of \u2013 only moments. Don\u2019t miss the now. I\u2019ve been one of those people who never went anywhere without a thermometer, a hot water bottle, a gargle, a raincoat and a parachute. If I had to do it all over again, I\u2019d travel lighter next time. If I had it to do all over again, I\u2019d start barefoot earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall. I\u2019d ride more merry-go-rounds, I\u2019d watch more sunrises, and I\u2019d play with more children. If I had to do it over again\u2026 but you see, I don\u2019t\u2026 Then this is what I wrote back to him: This was written by your sister who has a sneaking suspicion that she is going to die someday. If I had to do it over again... I would have snuck out of the window when I was 16 and gotten so drunk that I threw up on the front porch. I would have stayed up to watch the sunset from the back of that patrol car, and probably not spit on that one burly dude. I would have shown up for a few of my classes in high school, and college, and not cheated on the SAT, the ACT and each of the 5 AP tests I took. I would have slept around A LOT, and danced like a skanky whore in Tijuana. Maybe I would have even eaten those fish tacos from the vendor on the corner when I was there. I'd lie to my parents about how college was going, Spend my tuition money on booze and sell my textbooks for admission to underground dance clubs. I would take long road trips with girlfriends, flashing truck drivers and letting the wind blow through my blond hair without wearing a seat belt.

{"date": "22 March, 2005", "body": "\nI received this letter from my dear friend LM. Her daughter goes to school with my son. I think hers is a voice of reason amidst those who would only sound for political gain. The italics are mine. Terri\u2019s Choice Terri Schiavo\u2019s case is a tragic family saga turned into a shameless political debacle.   I, unlike Congress, the courts and the Bush administration, do not pretend to know all that is involved in her case. In my own futile stand, I choose not to read all \u201cthe facts\u201d.  No amount of arguments from the right-to-life activists nor the right-to-die proponents will persuade me to believe there is one right solution. The only one who could make the right choice for Terri, is Terri. The one fact I do know is Terri is mentally impaired and cannot vocalize her preference.  No question her quality of life is nothing like it once was, but is that reason enough to starve her to death?  For some the answer is yes, for others no.  The problem is, we do not know what Terri wants. I have reluctantly followed this case because my daughter lives in a comparable mental state.  But unlike Terri, she was born that way.  She is now 5 years old and we still don\u2019t know if and what she understands.  Like Terri, our daughter does laugh, smile, and cry.  Similarly she does not respond to questions.  She does not choose.  She does not communicate in the conventional manner.  Is that a life?  Who is to say? What I do know is that my husband and I have decided that for our daughter, that is a life, if uniquely her own life.  It may be different from ours, but for her, it is the only life she will have.  We made a choice as parents to do as much as we possibly can for our daughter, until that privilege is revoked by powers greater than our own government.  We do not know what life span she may have, but we are going to help her make the most of what she does have.  That is our choice as parents and no court in the land can make us do otherwise. Yet. This threat to revoke our parental choice makes us deeply sympathetic to the Schiavo parents.  On the other hand, if I were in a similar vegetative state, I would elect to have my tube removed.  Again, that is my choice.  And I would depend on my husband to carry it out.  And this may have been Terri\u2019s choice as promulgated by her husband.  Which makes me sympathetic to him and his interpretation of her preference.  See?  No easy answer. Some may call me a hypocrite, but I suspect those who profess there are absolute solutions to intensely personal decisions about the sanctity and quality of life are na\u00efve.   There are no clear cut decisions as this case shows, and as we have learned from our own daughter\u2019s experience.  But a mandate seems to have emerged from this tragedy.  We as a country must not debate and legislate on the right to life, either at birth or death.  Instead, we must go a step further and work to preserve our choice to make decisions for ourselves and respect the right of others to make their own choices.   For the sanctity of our ability to choose is what makes us different from many countries in this world.   It is not what we choose so much as it is the ability to make that choice.   So let\u2019s leave Terri\u2019s family alone, move on, and work on things we can solve.  I hope she would agree.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2005/03/letter-from-liesl-m.html", "title": "\nA Letter from L. M.\n"},

{"date": "02 August, 2005", "body": "\nJake fell down the stairs tonight. He's okay. I heard him go down as I was standing in the kitchen speaking with my husband who is still at the office. Jake was still wearing his tennis shoes. This probably made him fall (because his rubber shoes stuck to the carpet when he dragged his left foot) and wearing shoes probably made it so he didn't break his neck as he fell (since his rubber shoes kept stopping him and slowing him down as he rolled). How did it happen? Well, Jake was ready for bed and I wasn't listening...so he went down on his own. I had just opened the gate to the stairs to actually walk him down myself..but then the phone rang, and we sold the Mercedes (finally) so I was trying to coordinate logistics with the husband and stumble bumble down he goes. I flew to the top of the stairs dropping the phone and managed to see him roll down the last three stairs. I got to the bottom landing just as he did (I think I really did fly). He jumped up. I sat on the bottom step and held out my arms. He leaned into them and put his head on my shoulder...for a brief second. I asked him if he was okay. He said \"hmm-da\" (which means? Anyone? Anyone?). Then he looked me in the eye and yelled at me. I apologized for not helping him downstairs.* After getting him into pajamas, he was crying...with tears (this rarely happens..he must be  very, very  sad or tired or hurt to cry with tears).I pulled him up onto me in the rocking glider thingy. He is really too big now. Much too big, but somehow we managed to snuggle up and I just started to sing. He nestled into me closer, put his head up to look at me, then dropped his head and sighed..and went to sleep. The song that popped out of my head was one of my favorite camp songs. I went to  Camp Nawakwa  in the San Bernadino Mountains every summer from the summer after first grade until the summer after eighth grade... or maybe the next summer. I was a counselor in leadership training when I ended, staying five or six weeks I think. I remember I went with Stephanie Jaeger that last year. Anyway. I haven't sung this song in over 15 years, and all of a sudden it was the only song in my head. I wonder why? Was it because I needed comfort too and this song is from a time when I was safe, and unburdened? From a time when I still didn't know what I didn't know? Was it because I can't believe I now have this much responsibility...that I am old enough to have a nearly five year old kid fall down the stairs...in a house that we own? and be really shaken by it. I'm not sure. It felt good to hear that song again. I remembered most of the verses too. On The Loose Have you ever watched the sunrise turn the sky completely red? Have you slept beneath the moon and stars, a pine bough for your bed? Do you sit and talk with friends though a word is never said? Then you're just like me and you've been on the loose chorus (sung after each verse): On the loose to climb a mountain, on the loose where I am free On the loose to live my life the way I think my life should be For I've only got a moment and this whole world yet to see I'll be looking for tomorrow on the loose There's a trail that I'll be hiking just to see where it might go Many places yet to visit, many people yet to know And in following my dreams, I will live and I will grow On a trail that's waiting out there on the loose Have you ever heard a whippoorwill singing to the morning dew? When you hear the bells ringing, do you know they ring for you? And when you look back on the past, all I really ask Is to remember me when you're out on the loose So in search of love and laughter I'll be traveling 'cross this land Never sure of where I'm going for I haven't any plan And in time when you are ready, come and join me, take my hand And together we'll share life out on the loose As I sit and watch the sunset and the daylight slowly fades I am thinking of tomorrow and the friendships we have made I will value them for always and I hope you'll do the same And forever we'll explore life on the loose *as a side note I think that was a very typical response for anyone in our family.

As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love, for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.

He has mild cerebral palsy ataxia (he walks like he's drunk, but he does walk, run, hop, skip, jump and climb). He is also on the Autism Spectrum (but hey, isn't everyone these days?) He is healthy, and strong...with an emphasis on strong. At just 5 1/2 he's already 3'11\" and 59 pounds of pure muscle. Our kid has a lot of energy, loves to eat and run around the park or play in our backyard. He is just begining to talk, so he is a bit frustrated trying to communicate, but it is pretty easy to figure out what he wants once you get to know him. He is actually a very easy kid to watch as long as you don't ever let go of his hand in a parking lot. So basically I need a bit of help. I am about to have a baby...any day now, and our boy's current caretaker needs to have surgery, and can't take care of the physical needs of children anymore (What a great suprise for me!). I am also still doing some consulting work, so we would like to find someone who wants to stay with us for awhile. So we are looking for: - A part time nanny (babysitter, caretaker, second mom, child care provider, girlfriend whatever you want to call it...) - Approximatley 20 hours a week - Fairly set schedule (say Tues, Wed, Thurs 1:00-6 pm and a date night? we can work it out). - Occasional additional hours possible if desired. - Our last three caretakers have been $10.00 an hour. This is somewhat negotiable. I know it's not a million bucks a year, but the pay will be consistent and the checks won't ever bounce. We also provide money for ice cream, zoo, gas money for trips and such..of course. - Pick Monkey Boy up from the bus (in front of the house) during summer school and into the fall so timeliness is VERY IMPORTANT. - Prepare healthy snacks (or not so healthy trips to the ice cream parlor). - Light cooking (for the kiddo, not for me...but you can unload the dishwasher for me if you want to). - Take Tiny Man to the park, or zoo or something so you two don't die of boredom. - Get him ready for bed with bath, jammies etc if necessary. - Provide consistency with kiddo's school and life goals (potty training, eating with a fork, walking and holding hands etc.) - Change diapers, wipe his nose when he catches a cold this winter, and all of those other things that I would do if I were watching him (like save him from a burning building, etc.) Requirements: Male or female candidates only, excellent driving record, English speaking, experience with children and love of them, patience, valid Cal driver lic., your own safe and insured car (although we do have a car which could be used..we can talk about this one), and references. Joie de vivre. Physical strength and energy is a must. Please be willing to make at least a bit of a commitment. May not bring your own children. No smokers (or at least you can't do it with the kid, or smell like smoke). We have two golden retrievers who can stay in another area of the house while you are here, but the kid loves the dogs, so probably being comfortable with dogs would be helpful. Oh, and you must be able to tolerate a dark sense of humor and a very frank family. Please email me and we can figure out if we are right for each other.

{"date": "20 October, 2005", "body": "\nWork & Family: Employers aiding parents of disabled children Thursday, October 13, 2005 By Sue Shellenbarger, The Wall Street Journal For years, David Bruesehoff hesitated to tell anyone at work about his daughter, Karissa, who has autism and Down syndrome. At his company and many others, \"it's the 'culture of the smart,' \" the Dallas father says. \"It can be hard when another parent is talking about his child getting into prep school, and your child's big accomplishment is getting on the bus to go to school.\" A code of silence has long kept parents of children with disabilities, from autism and Down syndrome to cerebral palsy and depression, from talking about their kids at work. Now, driven by growth in their numbers and in the cost of raising special-needs children, some of these parents are starting to \"come out\" at work. And a handful of employers are stepping up to help, with support groups, informational meetings and insurance benefits. The incidence of U.S. children and teenagers with a disabling condition has tripled to 7 percent from 2 percent in 1960, based on data published in 2000 in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, reflecting increased survival rates and a rise in the diagnosis of conditions such as autism. Today, an estimated one in 12 U.S. workers has a child with a disability or special need, says MassGeneral Hospital for Children, Boston, which is conducting a five-year, federally funded project to examine workplace supports for these parents. \"Stigma and fear of reprisal\" have kept many workers from disclosing their family situations, says Chris Fluet, director of the MassGeneral project. The risks of speaking up are real: Soon after Kevin McGarry, Hyde Park, N.Y., started asking questions about insurance coverage for his disabled daughter on a previous job as a paralegal in the mid-1990s, his supervisor got upset and told him to stop asking for benefits. \"They didn't want my health insurance company to get wind\" of the rare syndrome his daughter had from birth. Although his performance previously had drawn praise, he says he soon started getting negative feedback. Eventually he was laid off. Having a child with a disability also requires time and effort to find and manage treatment, forcing 30 percent of these parents to quit or cut back at work, says a 2001 survey by the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau. Few parents can afford to cut back. More than 40 percent of families with special-needs kids have financial problems because of care costs, says a study published in June in Maternal and Child Health Journal. And 60 percent of children with special needs rely on their parents' employers for health insurance, MassGeneral says. Now, some parents are taking the opposite tack -- turning to the workplace for support. After her autistic son was born 11 years ago, Kathy Gonzalez, a technology manager at Toyota Motor Sales USA, Torrance, Calif., was overwhelmed trying to find treatment for him. Seeing her co-workers networking on other topics, she helped start a support group last year at Toyota that draws up to 40 parents of special-needs kids to its monthly meetings. \"If I could help even one parent get on track for whatever service they need for their kid, it would be worth it,\" Ms. Gonzalez says. At Microsoft, employees with autistic children have formed a similar network. Jack Harris, whose 11-year-old son is autistic, was startled to learn during on-site meetings of a father's network at PricewaterhouseCoopers's Tampa, Fla., office, that 10 of the 50 other men there also had children with disabilities. With PricewaterhouseCoopers's blessing, Mr. Harris, a practice support manager, is planning an on-site special-needs resource fair early next year. The firm is looking for other ways to support such parents, a spokeswoman says. In recent years, Mr. Bruesehoff gradually began talking about his daughter on his job in Los Angeles for accounting firm Ernst & Young. Then, when he was offered a transfer to Dallas in 2002, \"I decided I was just going to come clean\" and explain that the availability of programs in Dallas for Karissa, now 17, would be pivotal. Co-workers responded warmly, helping his family forge new ties in Dallas, where he now works as a human-resource manager, he says. Mr. Bruesehoff is among 64 parents of special-needs kids who have joined a parent network formed last January by New York-based Ernst & Young. Sandra Turner, a human-resource manager, says parents on the network's informational conference calls are slowly opening up to each other. While fewer than one-fifth were willing to give their names on the first call, about half now feel comfortable identifying themselves. Raytheon, an aerospace and defense contractor, has hosted several speaker dinners for employees with special-needs children at its Tucson, Ariz., and Woburn, Mass., facilities. Jeff Stolz, whose son Joseph, 10, has autism and bipolar disorder, was among those attending. Heartened to learn many of his co-workers also had special-needs kids, Mr. Stolz for the first time took Joseph in April to the annual \"Take Your Child to Work\" day festivities at Raytheon. He was apprehensive; Joseph verged on a tantrum during an introductory session. But as the day wore on and supportive adults reached out to him, Joseph calmed down, and even introduced himself by microphone at the closing session. In a surprising move in today's cost-cutting climate, a few employers are even expanding insurance coverage for special-needs kids. Microsoft, oil-industry supplier Halliburton, and insurer Progressive Group have begun covering some of the cost of applied behavior analysis, or ABA therapy, intensive early training for autistic kids that can cost $20,000 or more. These employers, of course, are the exception. If you have a child with a disability, only you can size up your corporate culture. A MassGeneral manual offers tips and resources, available online at www.massgeneral.org/ebs by clicking on \"Resources for Employees,\" then opening \"workplace benefits.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2005/10/sharing-story.html", "title": "\n"},

{"date": "23 September, 2006", "body": "\nLoved this article in the  SF Chronicle about homework *************************************************** The Future of Homework Over the past decade there has been a significant increase in the amount of homework schools require.  Not many adults experienced an hour or more of nightly homework when they were ten years old.  This increase may have come in response to the call for higher expectations, comparisons of American student performance with that of children from European and Asian countries, and the pressure created because of state testing programs.   When I talk to teacher groups about the explosion of homework, it\u2019s often stated that, \u2018we give homework because parents expect it of us.\u2019  Teachers report that parents believe that the homework is a sign of a rigorous program.  It has also been reported that parents want the homework because it keeps the kids busy.  When I talk with parents the viewpoint I most often hear is, \u2018the teacher believes this work is important and we feel we must support the school.\u2019 Ever increasing amounts of homework for younger children has become the norm and accepted practice. A majority of both teachers and parents support this position because they feel the system demands and believes in the efficacy of homework.  More than any other single person, I believe I most represent the Oak Knoll \u201csystem\u201d.   Here is what I know and believe about homework. The preponderance of research clearly shows that homework for elementary students does not make a difference in student achievement.  It is hard to believe that a strategy used so extensively has no foundation.  Even the most ardent supporters of homework have only been able to produce evidence of associative rather than causal relationships.  In addition, it is not surprising that there is no research that demonstrates that homework increases a child\u2019s level of understanding, improves their attitude towards school or inspires a love of learning.  For a large number of students we know the opposite is true-- large amounts of homework stifle motivation, diminish a child\u2019s love of learning, turn reading into a chore, negatively affect the quality of family time, diminish creativity, and turn learning to drudgery.  Unable to produce evidence that homework improves student performance, proponents often site outcomes that seem true because they make some kind of intuitive sense.  \u201cWe give homework because it develops responsibility, study skills and work habits.  Once again, there is no research to support any of these claims.  If there was, we would be able to say with some level of authority how much homework it takes to develop good work habits--- two hours a week, four hours a week, or maybe a half hour every other day.  We don\u2019t know what is necessary- there is no data.  I would suggest that our present one hour, four days a week, thirty-six weeks a year, following a six-hour school day is much more than is needed to develop age appropriate work habits in nine and ten year old children.  I certainly don\u2019t believe that homework teaches our children responsibility.  There are very few choices in homework.  The children are completing work that is required.  They are complying with adult demands.  Comply or suffer the consequences.  This is not my idea of responsibility. The argument for homework that makes the least sense to me is, \u201cthey get lots of homework in the middle school so we better get them used to it\u201d.  Parents and teachers say this resigned to the fact that this homework experience may be painful, work against quality family time, and diminish a young child\u2019s fondness for learning.  We want to get them ready to do something they are not going to want to do when they are older--- by forcing them to do it when they are younger. Young children are not the same as older children.  What is good for older children is not what is good for younger children.  There are developmental differences.  Author Alfie Kohn says, \u201cThe fundamental choice we face as parents and teachers is whether our primary obligation is to help children love learning, or get them accustomed to gratuitous unpleasantness so they can learn to deal with it.\u201d With all that being said, what are we going to do about homework at Oak Knoll?  How will we work and support the homework policies of Menlo Park?  In no particular order: \u2022 We will promote reading as the central aspect of our homework.  Preferably, reading of the child\u2019s choice. \u2022 We will not provide weekly homework packets that have not been differentiated based on individual student needs.  Weekly packets help parents and students manage time.  However, packets of this nature almost always include homework of which the child has demonstrated in class that he has absolutely no need to complete. \u2022 At no time will homework exceed the district maximum time limits. \u2022 We will not assign homework for homework\u2019s sake.  \u2022 Homework, other than reading, will be assigned when a specific need arises, when it\u2019s necessary to practice a skill or complete important work.  With these directions in place, most parents will notice a considerable reduction in the amount of homework.  The Oak Knoll teachers will be working to comply with my direction as principal and with the policies adopted by the Menlo Park Board of Education.  Parents should also notice an increase in the relevance of the homework to their child\u2019s needs.  Should you have questions about the quantity and quality of homework please feel free to contact me. *************************************************\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/08/ING0FLHNM21.DTL"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2006/09/future-of-homework-over-past-decade.html", "title": "\nThe Future of Homework\n"},

Very scary that part. We arrived at  The Balboa Bay Club  at 5:36. We had dinner reservations in the nice \"coat and tie\" part of the club at six. Somehow we managed to get Jake an ironed outfit, the Mom into a holiday dress, the dad into a coat and a tie AND pants that fit comfortably, babyLucy nursed and dressed in her Christmas dress...and make it into the restaurant by 6:15. Not bad. I think. We were able to see my neighbors from childhood, even  Julie  who was making a Left Coast appearance. Jake didn't make it all the way through dinner. It was a lot of stimulation for those of us without \"special needs\". He was a trooper though. He finished his dinner, but before even our appetizers could arrive he really needed to go to bed. Descartes graciously said he would retire with Jake (I'm sure the lure of removing his tie helped him make the decision). We sent Descartes' food \"to go\" to the room.

I have taken down the tree, the lights off the house and the Christmas boxes are back out into the rafters of the garage, but I am still sorting through holiday cards, peering at family and friends and debating whether to throw away those lovely photo cards, or stuff them into a small sack (think babyGap bag) and place them in a box or on a shelf where i will find them in one and two and three years and experience the wonder of whether I should keep them all over again. So Christmas part two was driving back to Northern California. I suppose I never finished Christmas part one. That was Christmas dinner at my mother's house. My mother and father have a beautiful home which has a view of the ocean. They took advantage of the vista and placed a tent with a heater in the back yard, set up a long table, put out the finest china and wheeled out the high chair and booster seats for the babies. It is not very often that we are all in one place. This year we had all four kids and spouses and their kids. We are an odd lot, filled with insecurities and joys and pride and eagerness and needs and hopes. I know each family has their own shape but I am not sure this family even knows what it is supposed to look like sometimes. It took so long for the \"blended\" part to blend.. we are still working on it. When my parents remarried and I realized I was going to have three step sisters and one step brother in addition to the one brother I came with.. I just decided that this is what my family looks like, what it will look like for a long time so I had better get used to it. I called the girls my sister when I introduced them ( and when I put their names on Gap family Day invitations) and the brother, well he was a brother. I introduced my new step parents as my \"mom\" or \"dad\". This was most painful to everyone else at first. My older step-sisters probably didn't really want me around at all  at first, and it has only been in the last 5 years or so that I feel like there is a deeper affection (at least with one of them!) My step-brother (from the other side of my family) and I really love each other, but we don't know each other very well. We are getting to know each other better as we get older, but having never lived in the same house, it is difficult to have shared memories outside of the Christmas when Demanda fell into the Christmas tree and Easter when Maga (his grandmother) wore all black. We are getting there though, and have had quite a bit of fun in small bits and pieces. So Christmas part one was beautiful and made very relaxing by the fact that my parents had put us up in the fanchy schmancy hotel providing us with a little breathing room with crazy Jake and babyLucy...and giving the precious objects in their home a chance to live another year. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2007/02/christmas-parts-two-and-three.html", "title": "\nChristmas Parts Two and Three\n"},

Later when the kids are older, instead of handing them scrapbooks tenderly pinking-sheared at the edges, multi-colored and properly stickered, I will hand them the stack of family wall calendars.. they can match up the photos later, but that calendar is one of the true records of our family. It notes not only what we actually did, the appointments we made etc..but it documents all of the things we planned on doing, all of our good intentions.. along with what we thought was important at the time ( mail insurance payment ...Jake new wheelchair), and what we really really wanted to do  (budget check, dinner with the Shraguers)  It also lists every birth, death wedding and baptism. Almost like a family bible. There are flight plans, happy faces next to the word vacation!.. and now, Jake's words. At the beginning of the month Jake was riding his adapted bike at school with the help of his one-on-one aide Anna. She is amazing by the way.  They stopped to admire a flowering cherry tree. They are in full bloom in in Bigtree City, pink tinged and abundant. Anna asked my son, \"Aren't they beautiful Jake\"? He leaned forward, thrust his hand toward the tree, grabbed a handful of flowers and said \"For Jen\". For me? for me? His teacher was so excited she called my house and left a message for me immediately. It is age appropriate for Jake to refer to me by first time. At this age kids have sort-of figured out that there parents have their own identity. Later that evening, as Jake was in his bed and the lights were off leaving only the light from the stairwell.. I snuggled in next to him and asked if he had maybe picked the flowers for Janet his teacher. He made no sound. When I asked if they were really for me... he said, very quietly \"yeah.\" They sent home the one  flower  that stayed in his hand all the way back to the classroom.

{"date": "20 March, 2007", "body": "\nboth of my children like superheroes. Deciding what to do about purchasing figurines was a tough one. Jake stole a  Polly Pocket    from his friend Leila...and I mean he totally 100% hid it behind his back as she was leaving... then he hid it in the toy box. so we decided we needed to get him his own action figures. When Descartes and I hit the store (this was last summer) we had one of those parenting moments..for those people who are choosing to actively parent...uhm what kind of toys do we want our kid to play with? We have been able to decide a lot of things for Jake, purely because he can't tell us what he does want. We just try to watch carefully and support his choices. So we went with the intent, (okay my intent) to buy him a  Polly Pocket    set. Once we were at  Toys R Us  Descartes started to back away from the idea of  Polly Pocket    and suggested  WWE Figurines . I pretty much nixed that idea immediately. We compromised on  Dora the Explorer . Of course once we looked at them we realized that they were fat and stubby...exactly not what Jake had liked about the tiny  Polly Pocket    Dolls. Then we started looking around and saw those  GI Joe  guys. My brother played with those, and with all of the  Star Wars  action figures. Descartes can't remember what he played with. I think he just dug under the house with his dad for his entire childhood. But I sort of have it in my head that if you have guns in your home which are real, then you can't have guns as toys. Well also I don't think guns are toys period. I don't even like water pistols..although at one point we did have a small space-man looking bubble gun to blow bubbles in the bathtub...but even that is gone now. I said \"no\" to  GI Joe  to all of those crazy ninja figures and anything else that seemed to come with a gun a grenade or both.

I do not care if it is 8:30pm or 7 o'clock in the morning on a school day. If you poop into the toilet you can have ice cream\". Jake ate some ice cream today. I was not even home, but I had told Valerie, Jake's 1:1 at home (that's what I am calling her now, since he is not a baby, and she sure as hell never gets a chance to sit!) She called me to tell me that she took Jake to the pot and lo and behold it was perfect timing..plop and the kid got to eat ice cream. I went out and bought a gallon of the good stuff in anticipation of great things.  ************\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2007/05/spoiler-alert.html", "title": "\nspoiler alert\n"},

I want to read it while he is still buckled in the seat on the bus, possibly before I even smile and say welcome home. Because Jake can't exactly tell me what he did at school, that notebook is the only way I know whether he ate his lunch, played nicely, wet his pants, stole his friend's cracker, had a bm, went to the library... I want to read it so I can talk to Jake about his day and fill in both sides, so we are having a conversation. I put Jake in his car seat then as I am walking back to the driver's side I grab the notebook and read the 4-5 sentences quickly so I can have the information when I get back into the car. I say, \"So you went to the library today\". Jake says, nothing, but he squints his eyes, which I think, am fairly certain, means \"yes\". \"And you sat with your friend from the other class\"? It doesn't say this in the notebook. I am guessing, but Jake does not squint, instead he purses (is that the right word) his lips together, which may, or may not mean \"no\". and so on, until we drive up the steep drive and around to the back of our house. There are days when the notebook says sad things, like \"very hard time transitioning today\". Or perhaps, \"Jake had a rough morning, but settled down after lunch.\"(there really isn't that much time after lunch before leaving school!) But today the note read \"Jake did amazing during circle this morning. He came up and took his name from the board all by himself. Then Jake picked a colored pen to write on the easel with, by  himself . No physical prompting. He showed quite a bit of independence today.  Great Day! \". so today is a good day, and I cried.

While I know that God knows about every hair on my head (or the forty-odd scraggly ones which are left thanks to Lucy beating me up with crazy girl hormones, coupled with my lack of nutrition--see previous post on  Candy hearts not being vitamins ...) anyway, God knows about the hair. I still have not completely resolved my theology to think that I deserve much air time, so I keep my prayer list short. Descartes has a hard time when I say things like \"Please God, please let me get Jake's leg into this pair of pants before we both completely lose it\". I think that he thinks I am \"wasting prayer\" on something stupid. Although he will admit he hasn't exactly worked out all of the kinks in his belief system; like whether he has one. Not all of my prayers are prayers of petition. My prayers are prayers of thanksgiving mostly. I really, really am thankful most days for this exact life that I have. Then the next day I don't believe there is anything more than today, this day, and I am merely a collection of molecules (all organic baby!) and religion is a social construct created by the collective human intelligence as a way to deal with seemingly important moral dilemma and the inevitability of cell death. (note to self:speak with Pastor about this juxtaposition of emotion). But overall this is where I land. I am currently  Lutheran  if for no other reason than the fact that my sister, Demanda, signed me up (another story, another time...). I like the idea that this denomination of Christianity started as a rebellion of sorts. I mean any thing that starts with someone nailing a list of 95 theses on the door of the castle church  basically saying, \"uhm I don't think so\", that's pretty cool. salvation by God's grace alone--Sola Gratia through faith alone--Sola Fide revealed through scripture alone--Sola Scriptura**** that's the gist of the Lutheran theology Grace, faith and words... pretty good things to boil down to. ****by the way I am  \"ELCA\"  Lutheran... for many reasons..but one distinction I note in particular is that ELCA (versus  Missouri Synod ) does not look at the Bible literally ( Biblical inerrancy ), but rather with a mind towards  historical/critical analysis ...which is much more my style.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jennyalice.blogspot.com/2007/01/candy-hearts-are-not-vitamins.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_America", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheran_Church-Missouri_Synod", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Criticism"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2007/05/grace-faith-and-words.html", "title": "\nGrace, faith and words\n"},

{"date": "12 June, 2007", "body": "\nSo we got back from Tahoe on Sunday night.. and I just sort of knew that Jake was not going to make it through school on Monday... his nose wasn't running when he left for school (I swear), but twenty minutes into it I got the call that he was snotting everywhere...he can't, or won't blow his nose.  That's the thing about having a special needs kid, sometimes it is the little stuff that kills you..like the fact that if Jake would/could just blow his nose twice in the morning he would get all of that snot out and be able to attend school... then I would be able to go grocery shopping with only one little girl... who is trouble enough all on her own \"that...that...that...\". So I picked up Jake when I got the call (Lucy and I were at Tar-jay buying Jake socks for camp... and life since he wears holes in them at the rate of about $4.89 a week). Luckily I had already downed two shots of espresso (on ice) and scored Lucy a cup of ice ... (I know.. not a good baby food).. so we went back to school where Jake smugly got into the back seat of the  car.. and I decided that we would take a shot at grocery shopping... so we invaded Safeway. I was hoping that the cart with the little bench seat would be available.. that would make it harder with Lucy, but that would mean Jake could sit down and  perhaps just \"be\" while I hurried through the store... of course it was being used by a family with a seemingly normal child (I know very unfair of me to say.. who knows, maybe that kid is autistic too..but based on extensive hahahah knowledge he was just fine dammit and he coulda walked). So I had to use a regular cart with Jake walking and Lucy haha belted in to the kid seat part. I know that the cart does not have a sign that reads... \"Please reserve this grocery cart for those families who are out of milk because they were traveling and it is now their baby's first birthday and the daddy has a job interview and the mommy would like to buy some tri-tip to celebrate, and some broccoli, and perhaps some yogurt as well, so that the older son, who has all sorts of special needs can take his medicine in the morning because if you take this cart it is entirely possible that this family might not get to grocery shop at all, or if they try to, people will stare at the writhing autistic boy on the floor in front of the cake mixes (because the mommy has realized that there is NO FUCKING WAY she is going to possibly make a homemade cake with two children home all day and no childcare). It is also possible that if the mommy has to use a regular cart she will need to steer it with only one hand since the other hand will be busy holding her autistic son's hand... so if her daughter tries to escape all she can do is pray that the baby (who is really not a baby at all anymore) will actually listen to the mommy and sit back down.. and if there is any sort of hill..well it is possible that the baby who is celebrating her first birthday on this very day may actually be sent flying all by herself because the mommy has to hold her son's hand ever-so-tightly so he does not escape, but sometimes he twists his arm all the way around (because he has low tone and he can do that).. so that the mommy gets confused about which way he actually goes, and has to use BOTH hands to unravel him and get him back on his feet and attached to her again. So please refrain from using this cart if your kid can possibly just walk along beside you.\" I know there is no sign like this.. but I sure could have used that cart.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2007/06/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-groceries.html", "title": "\nWe Don't need no Stinkin' Groceries\n"},

{"date": "01 July, 2007", "body": "\nor at least that's what it feels like. so here is the thing. Having a second child was a terrifying venture, one which took me YEARS to be okay with after figuring out that Jake was, well, Jake. We did, obviously, and WOW, I could not imagine how great my life would be adding Lucy to the mix. The kids played together in the backyard today, and little Lucy gave Jake a hug today.. and even better, he let her hug him! Alas...not all is perfect bliss. So here's my deal. I have been going to So Cal with Lucy every few months. Okay I have been twice. I get my hair cut and my mom watches Lucy. I go shopping with my mom and Lucy. We take Lucy to fancy restaurants (like we used to do with Jake when he was her age). Lucy plays with her little cousin Bubsy (who is 13 months older). Then I fly home where Jake and Descartes have been spending the weekend together. I was planning on going again at the end of July, or maybe in mid-August. So I was asked this evening if I was ever going to take Jake to Southern California for the weekend? Did I only take Lucy because my mom has a favorite? They were innocent enough questions, but it made me really sad. When I talked to Descartes about it, he (innocently) had made the same assumption that I would alternate which kid I take to visit 'my' family. He's not sure why it is such a big deal. And it's not really, but it is. Yes, it is a big deal to me. And so it has begun. This was one of the things I worried a lot about before Lucy was born. If Jake can't do something (go camping on the beach or go horseback riding for example**) does this mean that Lucy doesn't get to do it either? If I am not willing to, in my opinion, torment Jake with a trip to Southern California where he will need to \"be careful\" the entire time he is there.. does that mean I shouldn't go with Lucy a few times a year?  When Jake was a baby I used to drive down by myself, or fly regularly. Descartes and I also used to visit there a lot more than we do now (basically we go for Christmas now). I want Lucy to have some of those same special..all about the little baby experiences that Jake had. Am I awful for wanting that for her?  And maybe this is all wrapped up in the fact that my family doesn't really come here very often, and traveling with Jake is  a lot   more difficult than traveling with Lucy (although he  never  screamed on a plane like she has).  and here is the bad part I do like the experience  sometimes  of not being the mom with a special needs kid. No matter what, when I am with Jake, that is the first thing people think about. He is not a subtle child (unless you are at a water park.. you might not be able to see his disabilities right away at a water park). Not that I am not always his mom.. of course he is always taking up a ginormous space in my heart and head.. but when I am sans kids with my family, or with any one, or I just have Lucy with me,  sometimes  people are able to communicate with me without that sad face...that sad, \"poor jennyalice\" look.  Sometimes  I am able to have conversations which are not solely focused on my child's development.. or better yet, I am able to talk with my parents about Jake's development without the need to run around and chase the child we are discussing. I get a chance to breathe.  Is that selfish?  That's it, I'm selfish and that is one thing I do not like being called. I try each day to be as generous as I can, and this desire to take Lucy on a trip makes me feel selfish, which is why the questions rubbed me the wrong way. I don't know. I am sad. I am sad because this will keep coming up and I will keep being judged. If I take Lucy and leave Jake I am not being \"fair\", if I take Jake and leave Lucy then I am being a \"martyr\" who \"can't let go\". If I take them both I will be \"found dead in an airport bathroom\". Even if I go now and take Lucy as I had planned (by the way this was the last time this year I was going to do this, so it will have been a total of three times in 13 months), even if I go it will be tarnished and I will be thinking about how I \"left Jake behind\". And this is never going to be an issue with Descartes' family because they live near us, so my husband will never need to deal with this dilemma. Each kid has easily visited his parents' house solo, together, it is not a big deal because it is so common (though most times we are all together). I had the most amazing relationship with my grandmother. We went on the train together and to the opera and the zoo, and the symphony and plays and Europe... and my brother, he didn't do any of those things with her.

{"date": "09 August, 2007", "body": "\nSpecial report     Autism Speaks: the United States pays up     Abstract     In recent years, autism has become the golden child of the fund-raising circuit. Meredith Wadman looks at a US public-relations success that is driving research funds and expertise towards this childhood condition, and asks who is missing out.     Toni Braxton, Matthew Broderick, Bill Cosby -- perhaps not names you would associate with social or communication difficulties, and yet in one night, they helped raise $1.45 million at a fund-raiser for research into one of the least-understood disorders affecting children: autism.     Star-studded events such as that fund-raiser at New York's swanky Lincoln Center in April are the latest front of a public-relations battle to raise money for research into childhood diseases. In the United States, it's a battle that autism seems to be winning.     \"I was sitting in the nosebleed section and it was $1,500 a ticket up there,\" recalls neurologist Gary Goldstein, president of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore and chair of the scientific advisor committee for Autism Speaks, the group that organized the event. Goldstein recalls a 2005 Hollywood fund-raising concert featuring Jerry Seinfeld and Paul Simon.\"Every four months there's something like that, and that doesn't count all the golf classics,\" Goldstein says.     In less than three years, autism has emerged from relative obscurity on the fund-raising circuit to become the disease du jour. The 1,000 biggest US private foundations nearly doubled their autism-related giving to $2.7 million between 1998 and 2005, according to the New York-based Foundation Center. The Autism Society of America, the founding father of autism groups, has also seen its budget grow steadily to $20 million. More striking are the contributions of two newcomers: Autism Speaks alone raised more than $33 million in 2006,     its first full year of operation, and it is well on target to meet its goal of $55 million in 2007. And the lower-profile Simons Foundation, which began funding autism research in 2003, has spent more than $40 million and plans to spend another $100 million over the next five years.     The commonly held belief that the prevalence of autism is rising may be partly responsible for the cash flow. ...     But in the past two years, two people have had perhaps a greater impact on autism's visibility -- and coffers -- than any other single force, essentially rewriting the book on how to raise money for disease-specific research: Bob and Suzanne Wright, who founded Autism Speaks in 2005 after learning that their grandson had the poorly-understood condition.     Bob Wright, then chairman and chief executive of media and entertainment conglomerate NBC Universal, provided his business savvy and his extensive connections to a Who's Who of American stardom. He also brought urgency. \"I know how devastating this problem is to families. I am reminded of it daily,\" says Wright.     In 2004, Goldstein presented the Wrights with a graph contrasting charitable autism spending, then at about $14 million, with the $100-million-plus raised by disease groups for juvenile diabetes, muscular dystrophy, childhood cancer and cystic fibrosis -- all of which are significantly less prevalent. \"To move this field forward, we need that kind of money,\" Goldstein told them. Less than a year later, in February 2005, the Wrights launched Autism Speaks, which merged with the National Alliance for Autism Research and Cure Autism Now, in 2006 and 2007 respectively.     Today, the organization has 141 employees and thousands of volunteers in 41 states. \"At the rate the group is growing, I'd be shocked if five years from now it's not raising $100 million a year,\" observes Goldstein.     Although there are other private groups focused on research and treatment, in the past the public's awareness of autism has not been as high as it could have been. \"We were really out there by ourselves on awareness,\" says Wright. A public-relations coup changed that: last year, the group won a three-year campaign of free, slick publicity from the Advertising Council.     The New York-based Simons Foundation is a very different player. Formed by Jim Simons, a mathematician and hedge-fund billionaire who has an autistic daughter, the organization is spending tens of millions funding individual researchers. It's also financing a $12-million collection of genetic information and cell lines from 2,000 affected families that will be made freely available to other scientists. The database is called the Simons Simplex collection, and is to be stored at Rutgers University, New Jersey.     In 2006, Simons recruited Gerald Fischbach, the former director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, as his scientific director. Taking the job, says Fischbach, was \"a chance to focus on just the very best science\".     Terrific scientists     According to Fischbach, the swell of interest in the disease has been boosted by new genetic techniques and imaging tools. He notes that 11 of the 18 scientists to whom the foundation will soon make three-year grants of up to $3 million are new to the field. \"You couldn't attract terrific scientists if there were no good ways to approach the disease,\" Fischbach says.     There is a dark side to the surge in autism funding.     The upward trend in money and interest has been mirrored at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where funding for autism research has grown from $22 million in 1997 to $108 million this year -- with 16% of that growth happening since 2003, while the rest of the NIH has been essentially flat-funded.     At the CDC, which in 2000 spent just over $1 million on epidemiological research on autism, spending has soared to $15.1 million in 2007. Even the Department of Defense is getting in on the act, spending $7.5 million on autism research this year, largely thanks to Autism Speaks, which successfully lobbied Congress for the money on the grounds that autism in military families costs more than $200 million to treat annually.     The most recent legislative achievement of the autism-research advocacy groups is the Combating Autism Act, which was passed in December 2006 after intense lobbying. It guarantees that the spotlight will stay on the disease, requiring for the first time that the government draw up an annual strategic plan for autism research, identifying gaps and opportunities, all with the input of affected families.     \"The advocacy groups here have had an enormous impact,\" says Tom Insel, the director of the National Institute of Mental Health, which with its $62-million spending in 2006 made the largest financial contribution of the five NIH institutes that fund autism research. Insel, who also chairs an inter-agency committee that coordinates autism research for the federal government, says of the advocates: \"They hold our feet to the fire, and make sure we are relevant and accountable.\"     But something distinguishes autism advocates, especially Autism Speaks. \"They are actually raising very substantial amounts of funds to do a lot of the science themselves,\" adds Insel.     Bigger share     That fund-raising prowess has generated both admiration and envy from disease groups that could be considered competitors. For example, since the doubling of the NIH budget ended in 2003, NIH's cystic fibrosis funding has fallen from $117 million to $85 million; funding for childhood leukaemia from $70 million to $53 million; and funding for Down's syndrome, which is about one-fifth as prevalent as autism, from $23 million to $13 million.     \"Why is Down's syndrome funding low? Autism I think is a big contributor,\" says Jon Colman, the chief operating officer of the National Down Syndrome Society. \"It's dominating priorities.\"     Fischbach concedes that what's good for autism has to be bad for others that rely on NIH funding. As long as the biomedical agency's budget continues to be frozen year after year, he argues, pouring new NIH millions into autism necessarily means funding less research on some other diseases. \"There is a dark side\" to the surge in autism funding, he admits.     But other disease groups say that they have benefited from the rise in autism's profile -- some by learning from Autism Speaks' example, and others because autism can coexist with other, lesser-known diseases such as tuberous sclerosis and fragile X syndrome, which causes mental retardation. \"People are beginning to talk about the probable genetic basis for most autism. And then often, if not always, they mention fragile X as an example,\" says Robert Miller, the executive director of the National Fragile X Foundation in Walnut Creek, California, who was pleased when a recent cover story on autism in Newsweek made a passing mention of fragile X.     But despite its new visibility and funding, autism remains a little-understood and untreatable disease, and it is unclear how much this well-managed public-relations exercise will change that. Insel is optimistic, though. \"Autism has attracted the attention of the most stellar geneticists and neuroscientists,\" he points out. \"So I'm hopeful.\"     ------     Clinical Precision     Disease advocates should influence, but not dictate, research priorities.     Nature.com     August 8, 2007     Disease lobby groups have always made energetic efforts to ensure that the formidable resources of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) are brought to bear on the health issues that interest them; and that is as it should be. When these resources are expanding, there has been room for most of the participants in the process to feel that they are winning. Now that the budget of the largest research agency in the world is effectively frozen, there are likely to be more losers.     In the case of research into autism - a common but poorly understood developmental disorder - effective advocacy has seen a generous increase in NIH support specifically targeted at the disease, even since the real growth in the agency's total budget came to an end in 2003. Unfortunately, some of autism's success may have come at the expense of research into other children's diseases (see 'Autism Speaks: the United States pays up').     Autism research also garners an unusually strong level of support from private sources, including funds raised by the disease group Autism Speaks and contributed by philanthropists such as Jim Simons, a mathematician and hedge-fund billionaire whose daughter suffers from the condition. This year, these sources will spend some $50 million - roughly half what the NIH is spending on autism research. Typically, disease groups can muster charitable funding that is only a small fraction of what the NIH spends (see Nature 447, 248-254; 2007). That leaves them scrambling for slices of a pie that is no longer growing.     The power of some advocacy groups must be tempered to some degree. Scientists, especially those involved in the basic biomedical sciences, are also scrabbling for a share of these funds. The NIH's success has been built on a tacit accommodation between scientists, who run its 27 institutes and centres on a day-to-day basis, and the public, as represented by Congress. Institutes have been established - often against the scientists' advice - to deal with specific conditions or diseases of particular organ systems. Then Congress has, in large part, left the researchers and physicians in the agencies to pursue their work as they see fit, without indulging in too much micromanagement.     This has enabled the NIH to maintain a formidable reputation for scientific integrity and excellence, while also appearing to be reasonably responsive to patient needs. It has produced an agency that does a great deal of basic scientific research - with unknown and largely serendipitous benefits for the development of drugs and devices - as well as plenty of laboratory and clinical work devoted to particular ailments.     The public is paying for the NIH's annual budget of $29 billion, and it is entirely appropriate that it should energetically articulate its demands of the agency. That is one of the roles of the disease-advocacy groups, and their input, as any NIH institute director will attest, provides invaluable assistance in assigning research directions and priorities. That said, the power of some advocacy groups must be tempered to some degree - especially in today's difficult funding environment. Otherwise, these groups' ability to influence budgets is likely to dominate, to the detriment of both basic laboratory science and of research targeted at diseases that have weaker constituencies.     It falls to the scientist-administrators who run the NIH to work closely with members of the congressional appropriations committees that fund the agency to make sure that this does not happen. Both groups understand the careful political balance that has allowed the agency to thrive; they must act as moderators whenever the more energetic lobby groups are pushing the agency's agenda too far in the direction of one public-health issue at the expense of others.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070806/full/448628a.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2007/08/nature-article-about-autism-funding.html", "title": "\nNature Article about  Autism Funding\n"},

It has taken me nearly a week to figure out that the reason I could not log the computer on in my room was due to the fact that I needed to let the hotel pick an IP address for me.. oh well. it is probably better this way, as now that I  am  online I realize that the connection is so very very slow. Perhaps it is the only thing that  isn't  grand about the Grand Wailea. I have stored a few thoughts, so I'll just post as I get the time...  We arrived last Tuesday. Hours ahead of the rest of our family, which is good since our children were done being close to other people or nice to anyone. We figured out that we are not going to Europe any time soon with these children at these ages.. and certainly not Australia, and probably not even the East Coast. I am not looking forward to the flight home... there is no vacation waiting at the end of that flight. Now having said that I must also say that I am so proud of my children...especially Jake. He was such a good boy on the flights.. yes flights.. we had a layover and plane change in Honolulu. He was very cuddly and nice for nearly the entire flight from SFO to HON. In fact the only real problem he had was that he had to poop twice. Not sure if y'all know this, but airplane bathrooms are very very very very small. And my son is craptastic..and not potty trained. After Leelo's great potty training adventures I am inspired, and will be working hard for this when we get back, but alas we were stuck with one poopy boy and one small bathroom. He waited as long as he could. We had talked a lot that morning about trying to poop before we get on the plane etc. Then when he needed to go, he started to get the sillies and climb all over Descartes. He knows when he needs to go, just gets stage fright or something when he is there... anywhoooo all of the worst things happened, poop all over the place, Lucy only wanted Mommy, and Daddy can barely fit in an airplane bathroom by himself let alone with a 4 foot something 6.5 year old.. all this and Mommy forgot to take her crazy pill. We survived. Once you let go of the idea that children should not sit on the floor of an airplane bathroom you can pretty much get through most things.  So other than the toilet thing... Jake did very very well. Just played in his seat next to Daddy and ate every single possible snack we handed him. It was like a 5 hour snack session. The food on the plane was gross. So gross that Lucy actually took the turkey out of her mouth and very gently handed it back to me and said \"No. No\".. and my kids will eat just about anything. We later learned that getting up at 4:30am CA time, after a poor night's sleep, travelling all day with small crazy children, skipping lunch, then adding heat and alcohol, well, it can make Mommy and Daddy a little bit wobbly.  We made it though.. all the way the Kahaluhi Airport Maui...got our rental car and landed safely at the Grand Wailea. Our room was ready early. And whoever thinks this room has no ocean view... they are crazy. That is  Molokini   and  Kaho\u02bbolawe  in the distance. Our room  is perfect with a door that opens to my brother Gerard's room so Pinky and I can share hairspray (ha ha) and little Bubsy and Lucy can play with all of the toys those good parents brought for their daughter.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/RtMYXHV-8QI/AAAAAAAAATM/9tTdm2Pu4w8/s1600-h/CIMG4337.JPG", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molokini", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahoolawe"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2007/08/on-island-time.html", "title": "\nOn Island Time\n"},

So on Friday after trying the new tether with Jake and successfully shopping with both kids (as I have heard this may just be a miracle with two typical kids... so I felt extra good about it) I was able to meet my friend  Sage  for lunch. I had called her earlier in the morning and when she phoned back I found out that she had only one of her kids, but two kids of another friend of ours.  So the whole gaggle of us met at Johnny Rockets. I am not about to say that it is the best food in the world, but Jake and I  used to go there every single Wednesday (early day at his old school) and eat lunch together. The staff learned enough about us to bring me an iced tea without asking, and vie to wait on us since I always leave a big tip (it goes along with the messy table). When we walked in this time,  my  waitress said \"Oh she is so big (about Lucy) She just turned one, how was her birthday?\" How cute is that? SO anywhooo we were able to take over the back booth and Sage and I  proceeded to order copious amounts of french fries, and were able to speak a few words to each other between getting kids to be okay (and they were all SOOOOOO good)..then even better.. Got to see another friend who was there at the restaurant. random and so very nice, because our dear other friend is in chemo right now. breast cancer... nasty stuff that chemo, makes you lose your hair and all, but let me tell you (as I told her).. she looked damn near radiant with smooth skin and her same clear happy eyes and her sweet laugh, and her joy... she is the kind of woman who is joyous. It is almost palpable. I'm not sure if it is faith, or a strong marriage, or a strength born of many trials, but whatever it is, she is one of those \"good eggs\" and someone I love being around..plus she thinks I'm funny ...and  she gets all of my wise-cracks. We left Johny Rockets and made our way over to one of the other Mama's house (the one who owned two of the kids Sage had with her) and proceeded to play.. and eat Otter Pops, and talk and wow, my kids did great and the other kids were precious.. and I can do this.  I am just so lucky to know these great women, who get me and love my kids. It has taken awhile but there is some sort of somethin' somethin' going on for me, some good combination of things.

Happy children, they watched a pre-recorded CD of Sesame Street (which opens with a McDonald's commercial...this is called foreshadowing). After the pharmacy I decided I wanted ice cream. This doesn't happen to me very often, so I decided to listen to my body and search for drive through ice cream. Not really anything around except for McDonald's.

I...\" and I am interrupted by little Lucy who says very loudly with a little finger pointed so directly at the red box. \"..want McConalds!\" Descartes immediately tells me I am so busted. I almost started to cry, out of joy because my daughter can speak and point, and out of sadness and despair because am I seriously raising a junk-food kid? Then I remembered that McConald's is a proud sponsor of Sesame Street..and she sees that show once a day every single day...and so Descartes gives me that one and agrees that Lucy has really only had McConald's two other times, and only on car trips to Tahoe. jeesh.

She said it is hard not to be close enough to hug me.. which is nice, since I need a hug on most days. She said the hardest part about reading is that the person who shows up online is not the woman she knows. \"In real life\", she said, \"You are the strongest person I know, fearless and constantly leading the rest of us, and online there is another part of you that is vulnerable and fearful and doubting yourself and the way you are taking care of Jake and Lucy.

{"date": "07 October, 2007", "body": "\nIf one more f*cking person asks me what I think of  Jenny McCarthy  I am going to kill someone, possibly myself. Okay that is extreme. I am still growing and learning, as we all are, and I believe each family has their own journey.... as long as your journey doesn't hurt me (or your child),  you can travel whatever road you want,  and I will do my best to support you. So here is kind of what I think about a few things.. and I am so fired up right now listening  to Larry King Live  that I may throw up. I believe that Jenny McCarthy saying her son has been \"cured\" is lame. I think we learn to live with autism, you provide your child with every opportunity to engage in the world and offer as many different ways to communicate as possible so the child can be heard. But fine, her kid is healed, or cured..not going to happen for every child with autism...not going to happen...so re-frame it Jenny...like \"here is my personal story of hope that will probably not work for you, but buy my book and you can buy a piece of that hope.\"   [To be fair, she does appear to have some sense that not all children will respond as her child did.] I do not believe that vaccines  cause  autism. Jake didn't have  thimerosal  in his vaccines, most of the kids born after 2000 didn't either, so all of the new diagnosis? Maybe vaccines trigger autism in kids with a genetic predisposition? Maybe. We do know that measles, mumps and rubella can kill children, as can polio. I do not think that every child with autism benefits from a  Gluten Free Casein Free diet (GFCF) . I do think that some children may benefit from diet change. Almost any child on the planet eating a healthy, preservative-free diet, carefully monitored by an adult who ensures that all dietary needs are being met.. most kids are going to be more focused, healthier and have better bowel movements. Paying attention to your child's diet is a good idea. Being righteous because you can bake bread with rice flour is not cool. I think that actors/porno stars/whatever/entertainers are not scientists, doctors, or researchers...anecdotal evidence does not mean a cure. Ugh. I also do not believe that doctors are Gods or always right.. so there. I do think that people correlate all sorts of things (good and bad) that should not be correlated : In the U.S. most people in car accidents have had french fries within two weeks of the accident. French fries cause car accidents. Also most people who win the California Lottery have been in a liquor store within one week of winning the lottery, possibly purchasing alcohol. Drinking can therefore help you win the lottery. My child is never going to have Hyperbaric Oxygen therapy...unless he has the bends. Any doctor Board Certified,  DAN !  TACA , Holistic, or working unlawfully and without credentials who tells you that they can cure autism, and all allergies, and ADD, and ADHD, and bad breath, and sleep disorders and corns and eczema  with their wonder pill/magic formula is full of crap. However, if you want to take your kid  to someone who believes that they can cure your child...go for it... unless you are harming your child, I support you in your effort. NAET\u00ae  is crap crap crap \"NAET clears an allergy by rebalancing your body's energy when you are in contact  with the energy of the offending substance.\"  and my favorite \"If you are unable to be tested yourself because you are a child, pregnant, disabled, or too weak,  you will be tested through a surrogate . \" Allergy testing by proxy?  CRAP CRAP CRAP . okay I am tired.. I think a lot of other things too. I do know that I have lost relationship with a person who is very, very important to me because we did not try NAET. She thought that I was not doing every single thing possible to \"cure my child.\" I wasn't willing to throw money away holding vials of wheat flour and water in my hand while a  chiropractor  gave me some acupressure...maybe that does make me a bad mother.

It is very hard to push strollers and wheelchairs over pine needles, but the sausages are good, we all love sauerkraut and the beer selection is just lovely. So last year, and the year before we just bought the giant mugs. .It is one of those deals where if you pay a little bit more you get the souvenir mug and all of your refills are more beer for much less money. It is the way to go if you are going to have more than one beer. Which we may or may not have done in the past. I am guessing we had more than one in years past. This is the first year that I actually stood in line and thought about my purchase. I  wanted  to buy four mugs. I wanted to think that we were going to stay and hear the  ooompa  band and the yodeling competition and have several beers each and relax in the crisp air, soaking up September sun. I wanted to be optimistic. I want to be those people. The reality is that the chances of any one of the adults finishing even one beer without needing to deal with a kid-related crisis is pretty slim.  Jaster  and  Demanda  have \"twins\" (the boys are 7 weeks apart from two different wombs) and we have our independent sprite Lucy and our unpredictable elf Jake. We are not the kind of crew that gets to sit still, be patient or relax. So I compromised. We bought two mugs and two cups. I feel like this every day. In nearly every decision I make. I want to think that I can take my two children to the park, a park with no gates... uhm  no. I want to think that the kids and I can stop in and get some milk at the grocery store and have it take only ten minutes. I want to go to the movies, go on vacations and go out to dinner with my children. I struggle to find  the  balance; sometimes the  optimist  wins and I buy four souvenir mugs...sometimes we drink out of paper cups.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/Rx1TeeXrIoI/AAAAAAAAAec/GqM7nIuJ6oc/s1600-h/CIMG4541.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2007/10/stein-is-sometimes-half-full.html", "title": "\nThe Stein is Sometimes Half Full.\n"},

I had no idea how much a coloring book should even cost (for the record I did not have a lot of coloring books growing up.. my parents  di d not  see that I needed some one  else's  creative genius to figure out my own, and if I really needed help, my grandmother, Char was the amazing artist ever, and could really draw anything, then teach me how to draw it.) So I found them, and I stood there with tears in my eyes because Lucy was pointing at what she wanted and I find my self in uncharted territory. I wonder what is harder? Starting out with a kid like Jake who does not fit the norm, then being thrown for a loop with a more typical child, or starting out with one who does everything on schedule and with ease and following it with a kid who doesn't come close to the norm?

{"date": "19 October, 2007", "body": "\n ...let your kids play in dog shit.... You may think that your kids are safely playing on the secured, no-way-out deck watching the street scene from the front of your house. You might think, \"Hey. I bet my kids are getting hungry for dinner. I'll just run upstairs and make them something and have it all set when they come up. Wow, I am such a genius.\" I thought all of those things. And then, just as I was setting cute little trays onto the counter with home made shredded barbecue chicken, persimmons and raspberries for Jake, and a little perfectly cut chicken salad and cheddar cheese sandwich for Lucy, paired with strawberry yogurt, persimmons and grapes... chocolate milk for the girl, whole white milk for the boy... happy mommy chair between the two to facilitate more consistent eating....just as I was all set. I realized it was too quiet. I had been upstairs for 7 minutes. There is a reason Jake has protective supervision. Jake had climbed  OVER  the baby gate and gone into the side yard. The side yard is a point of contention in my marriage because this is where our TWO golden retrievers relieve themselves. It is also where Descartes very, very, rarely and only with considerable nudging picks up said \"relief packages.\" I clean it up once a month if Descartes doesn't; this is one of \"his jobs\" in our divided labor household. He has not cleaned it up, and I did it two weeks ago. (It has since been cleaned and sanitized mom... so no comments on that please !) So there is Lucy hanging on the baby gate pointing at her big brother who is standing squarely between 15 gigantic piles of poo. There is none on him, none on his shoes, none on his hands. He is in the middle of it just standing there. AGHHHHHHHHHHHHH! This is one of those moments in parenting where I had to **really** think hard as to how to fix this situation. No one was really in danger.. those situations I have down, no problem... but when there are moments like these it is harder for my tired mind.. maybe it's because my adrenaline  doesn't   kick in. Moments like these.. I need a Double Strength Diet Rockstar. So I put Lucy upstairs and gated her in and locked the dogs with her then I went around the back of the house and down to the side yard and plucked Jake out of the poo. It was only on his way out of the area, with mommy having startled him, that Jake stepped into a big old stooopid stinky pile of it. I closed the gate behind us, stripped Jake down and marched him straight into the tub inside the house, shutting the door behind us so Lucy would not think that it was family bath time. I used the rest of the Hibiclens and a bottle of dial soap. I trimmed Jake's nails and emptied the water a few times.... and there was never any poo on his body at all.. just his shoes. Then I bleached the tub, and walked out of the bathroom with Jake.. only to find Lucy had fed her dinner to the dogs, and had started to eat Jake's dinner. Lovely. I have now left my children unattended and let them play in poo and after all of that I still found myself trying to make [more] dinner while the kids are whining and ready to eat \"right this very second.\" Somehow we managed. By the time Descartes got home I had both children fed, bathed, jammied and in bed.

Jake does not have strep, he only has a  sinus infection . I do not have strep. Descartes did not even have a doctor's appointment. My life should be pretty much perfect. Except Jake had diarrhea at school and I had to pick him up and wait, have I told you about the  diarrhea  thing? This one really has worked for me. I look at whatever situation is going on in my family.... and I say, \"Well, does anyone have  diarrhea ?\" and if that answer is  no ...then I know right then and there that it is not that bad..because apparently  it could be worse because  everything is worse with  diarrhea   don't you think?  Now sometimes this does  not work because the problem IS  diarrhea ..but you get my point. So anywhooo I decided to fix the water at the kitchen sink issue we have had as of late.. for some crazy reason (the last plumber) the cold is hot and the hot is cold. So I went under the sink with a wrench (or seven) and fumbled around trying to fix it and discovered that, indeed I do have arthritis bad enough to not be able to do that.... and also, while I am rather handy, I am also a bit clumsy. I dropped a giant wrench on the bridge of my nose. Same place where Jake broke it several years ago. I sat up from under the counter (actually without hitting my head on the way out), and sat there and sobbed on my kitchen floor.  \"Why God, does everything have to be so hard all the time?\" and then it hit me. Plumbing is hard. This is why there are plumbers who make good money, and why even very smart people hire them. but more than that. I think somewhere along the line I think I had started to believe that because on most days, life with Jake is so very hard, that somehow the rest of my life should be easier. The fact of the matter is: the rest of the hard things in life might be just as hard for me as they are for other people, I just also have Jake. and now you are thinking this chick is so dumb. But really. I think I go around thinking that  I know I can't solve Jake, fix him or any such thing ; I am trying not to waste any more time on the 'why' of Jake. He is a mystery that I love and am trying to help him be an active part of his world. ...but every other thing on the planet? I should be able to fix those things because they all have answers.

{"date": "24 October, 2007", "body": "\nSo I took both kids to the park this afternoon. They had a great time. Better yet, I had a great time, which means we are getting better at all of this. I am less fearful, and more playful. I also figured out why Jake squats down in the middle of the water play area whether or not there is water on. He loves to squat and he is very good at it. Being very flexible helps. I can do it too. Hyperflexability sort of runs in my family. But here's the reason: when you are in the center of the water play area there is a sort of a  focal point  where all of the sound comes together. When he sits in that one spot he can hear the children playing in the sand box, in the water play area and on the swings all at the same time. I never noticed before because I normally give Jake his space in the park, allowing him to roam safely away from me; for once not holding hands while outside. Today I went over to him and bent down and covered him with myself, enveloping him in a hug, sort of just thankful for him, and I heard all of the sounds when I bent down. I never would have guessed a focal point would be there because there is only a half circle of cement around the water play area, and the wall is very low. This has been Jake's favorite place in the park since he could walk. It has taken me 5 years to figure out why. It makes me wonder what other amazing things he knows, and makes me want to run through every single one of his \"odd\" behaviors and figure out if there is a \"reason\" he does them. The other part of our park story, aside from the little Gremlin Lucy enchanting a precious 3 year old boy and encouraging him to chase her all over the park, is that Lucy sat down next to a little boy and his nanny and asked nicely with a signed please for some of their snack. Thankfully they were more than happy to have her there. When I joined them on the bench, the nanny asked \"Does Jake like to sing?\" (I had been using his name quite a bit encouraging Lucy to go hug her brother etc.). I said,             \"Well, yes. When he is happy he makes singing noises.\" and she said, \"Yes, I cared for a boy just like him in the Philippines. I never understood the words, but he loved to sing.\" I queried,        \"A boy 'like him'?\" and she said very plainly, \"Yes, a boy with autism just like him.\"                      \"So you can just tell?\" \"Yes.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.monolithic.com/plan-design/acoustics/index.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2007/10/you-can-just-tell.html", "title": "\nYou Can Just Tell\n"},

Redwood is very expensive. \n Spent Friday night playing \"Did Jake go out the dog door?\" ALL NIGHT LONG. The answer most times was \"no.\" Spent a good portion of this morning researching very expensive (like 500 smackaroos) radio collar unlocking dog doors so dogs can go in and out but children cannot (unless they steal a dog collar..which would, at this point, not surprise me.) \n Celebrated BQ's 40th birthday last night. Dinner, then fun conversation and staying late at the  English Pub  near  Stanfurd . Good times. Cab fare home only 25 bucks. Cabbie almost drove into a wall near my house.. not good \n My back is so screwed up that it is \"buzzing\" in my  thoracic spine area . Kind of scary. It is burning right now.. thinking that is not a good thing. \n My children  made it through a most delightful Halloween party, managing not to particularly set-off my dear friends' children. Jake has a unique ability to ruffle feathers with his lack of following directions and all. At one point Jake was surrounded by little girls in Disney Princess costumes. Lucy ate three rice crispy treats...at least. So apparently Tinkerbell is a pig. \n Remembered at 5:08pm that the flu shot clinic ends at 6pm at our doctor's office... raced the 12 miles and made it in time, with no line...and, get this:my kids didn't cry! Well, Jake did try to bite the nurse, but only because she was holding him down, and that does not fit into his happy place. \n Discovered through much mind melting research that perhaps the reason the guest room computer is slow is because one of the applications, or the OS itself has a memory leak. Fixing said leak requires much more work. We have had the computer for nearly 4 years and i have managed to just open it up and swap out parts etc. I hate terrorizing the environment with all of my technology upgrades, (I would rather place my carbon footprint elsewhere!) but it may be time to get a new system. \n Jake has NO school this week. None. Not a drop. Hoping for lots of nice days at the park since we can't even escape to Papa and Cookie's house  because they are de-constructing walls to put an ELEVATOR into their house.  Jake is not happy to be in a wheelchair lately ( and I don't blame him since he can walk...) but it does mean I need to come up with a better idea so that we can safely venture out of the house without him running off. My wrist is rotten from being twisted around when Jake does his famous spin move in an attempt to break free. \n Can I Sit With You?  submissions keep coming in. So exciting. Please share your story.

Jake went on the carousel without a  seat belt , on an  uppy -down horse with me only standing next to him. First time a grown up didn't need to help him stay on. He held on with both hands and everything. We really had a lovely time. Perfect weather. Well-mannered children. Not too crowded. Howler monkey SUPER LOUD, and no one lost any shoes. Stayed a perfect number of hours. Lucy did get mean and grabby with Mali at the end of the day, but she was just tired. They sat next to each other in a stroller all day long with no problem.

Surprisingly, after all these years, I still have embarrassment and resentment when he acts out.. see, even there I think of it as acting-out instead of part of a disability. I always think that since he  can  get it together he should be able to when I  need  him to. I actually told him he was \"being rude.\" I guess we have pretty high expectations in some areas for Jake.

{"date": "11 November, 2007", "body": "\nWe went up to SF today to see my family for the day before they head out of town on Monday morning. We sat through 40 minutes of traffic to go three blocks then we narrowly escaped being caught in the Veteran's Day Parade (thank you men and women  for your courage and self-sacrifice). We ate at one of the Ferry building restaurants and for some crazy reason I thought Descartes and I could walk with both kids to the Aquarium at Pier 39 and meet the rest of my family who would take the trolley car. Do you know that the Ferry Building is actually not even Pier One?  It was 1.3 miles to our destination. Not actually that difficult, except for these reasons: Lucy hates her stroller Descartes and I walk at two  completely  different paces. I do the fast \"retail\" walk, and Descartes? Uhm he has a smooth well-paced \"lumber\". Believe me, in an emergency Descartes could walk the 50 miles to save our family, but everyday walking together has been first a \"ha ha\" joke between us, then a problem, and now something we 'manage'... in this case I walked ahead with Lucy. Lucy hates her stroller. I wore my awesome black boots with a heel, which can  generally  be worn all day long. Lucy's stroller is broken and no longer has the ability to buckle anything to anything. Lucy is only 17 months (today) and therefore cannot walk 1.3 miles in the wind along a busy street without at least having her hand held. Okay so blah blah blah.. Lucy rode on my shoulders for 1.3 miles, then we did the whole touristy thing... then we walked back! I felt like I was doing that Avon walk again. I have blisters on the bottoms of both of my feet from wear my socks rubbed. Descartes hurt his back somewhere along the way yesterday. The point of all of this is that we did stuff that my kids enjoyed yesterday... with my parents. We went to a little Mexican restaurant that did not even have table service... we went to an aquarium...we sat outside by the water and drank smoothies. I think everyone enjoyed themselves too. It felt like we really were all  present in the moment  and there wasn't a lot of pretense or stress (aside from that initial traffic), or high highfalutin' something or other for me to panic over (you can dress us all up appropriately, but I have a kid with a disability and a toddler.. those two creatures don't exactly blend in at the club). It still wasn't a \"natural\" environment to show off my kids, but at this point what would that even look like? And it is hard to rest when you are fighting for a table at the wharf, but it was closer, sort of, to my parents spending time with Jake and Lucy that looks like Jake and Lucy being who they are. I don't believe we should live our lives around our children. I think parents coddle their kids, and give in way too easily/early. I think parents lose themselves in parenting, sacrificing their marriages and neglecting their minds. I think that removing all sense of winning and losing so kids can have \"great self esteem\" is wrong and going to seriously back-fire on our nation in the next twenty years. Kids should learn to sit nicely at the table, and have great manners and deal with itchy ties and stiff shoes, and be able to \"not speak unless spoken too\" if necessary. but... I do think that kids are only small once.  I am never having another baby. My parents are never having any more grandkids...okay , maybe one more? But not from me. It will be from my step-sister who we never see anyway. So this is it. Everyone's chance to make silly faces and read books to tiny people with little fingers who can't turn the pages well. This is it to see wonder and the world through the eyes of someone who has never seen it before. Lucy can already walk and talk. They only saw her twice before she could walk, so the 'baby' part is done. That's it. So I guess I'm glad we all went to the aquarium yesterday so they could see Lucy touch a sea star for the first time, and see Jake watch the anchovies swim 'round and around (they still may have a chance to see this in the future though, eh?). I'm glad we spent more time sitting and drinking smoothies in the California fall sunshine than we did gazing over menus at a beautiful high-end-hotel brunch.

I was able to make a  Celebration Chocolate Cake  and have it taste fine in spite of its not wanting to rise very well. We have amazing friends with hilarious kids. I think it went off well. Everyone got fed and most people were able to escape with their kids **just** before they melted down. __________________ It has been a hard month for me. September is always very hard. We normally vacation at the end of August, so we are generally unprepared for the first days of school, and all of the anticipation of \"the perfect trip to Hawaii\" or wherever is now replaced with the more solid memory of  how difficult it is to travel with our children . Then there are new shoes, and a new bus schedule (and a new driver), the weather is funky, some days cool, the next day 90 degrees, and I am always wearing sandals in the rain and knee-high boots in the heat.  September brings the feeling that I have once again left so many projects undone from the summer, that I have failed my kids because I didn't do more...museum hopping, pool play, picnicking, beach sand sifting or camping.  And then Jake's birthday is upon me, and I have no plans. No plans because my son doesn't remind me three times daily for a month that his birthday is coming, as so many other children his age will do. So his day sneaks up on me and then it is here, and I am smacked in the face with the fact that seven years have gone by. SEVEN years and this is where we are. And believe me, we are in a great, great place filled with new development and better eye contact, and wonderful things. But I apparently continue to think, somewhere in my mind, that Jake will be growing out of his --Autism, CP, ADHD, panic disorder-- any day now. So there I am on September 24th, a week before his birthday trying to shove all of my expectations back into the bag and tie it up again, more tightly than before, because it is so unfair to Jake, and to me.  So I tried very hard this year, though it was still last minute, to do something for Jake, and I did figure out that it is better to do something small and manageable, knowing that Jake might enjoy himself. Much better idea than spending a gazillion dollars on something where we may not have success. We got the little banquet room attached to his favorite burger and fry joint and invited some of the people we care so much about...some of the people who seem to care so much about us.  It was fantastic, and noisy, and filled with french fries and milkshakes. And I have now baked the cupcakes for Jake's party at school tomorrow.

Jake's IEP was just a few short weeks ago.. I think October 4th?. Since then there have been several  minimum days and a whole week of school off (actually a week and one day). And wouldn't you know it, Jake has shown significant progress in nearly all of his goals. We have always known/suspected that Jake knew colors, body parts, letters, numbers. He always looks liek he is \"in there\", but we have not done a very good job of clearly documenting what he knows...and when some of those \"experts\" come in to view him for school evals or whatever, it looks like his is a not-so-little boy who has no awareness, and no understanding of his environment. Making clear goals...and a notebook to document.. and PECS cards, we have been able to nearly 'clean house' on colors (choosing the desired color out of a field of two, switching left or right for placement of desired color-- get it?). It was stunning to look at the little journal they have created and see how diligent the note taking has been and how excited both teacher and aide are about his progress.

{"date": "06 May, 2008", "body": "\nBetty died this morning. Of course I would have known that she was sick had I actually delivered the library books last week when I was supposed to, but my life got in the way and she fell ill and went to the hospital, so that when I went today (and towed along my best friend and her precious 2 1/2 year old to visit some \"Grandmas\") she was gone. Talk about feeling like a heel for not delivering the library books on time. I have been volunteering for the library since 2003. I think it's been that long. I deliver books, to a few others previously, but consistently for the past 5 years 5 YEARS! to Betty and her friend Marie at an \"old-folks\" home nearby. Marie is still alive and kicking. She told me not to cry. She reminded me that Betty was 91, and that she had a great life. and it's true, she did, but I will miss seeing her and hearing her stories and watching her take joy in my daughter and share concern for my son. So here, for the record, lest I ever forget such a beautiful human are some things about Betty. Betty was a smart woman, clearly using  every year of her life to gather more information and hone it for precision communication. She was quick in conversation and more recently when she began to forget some words, she wrote them down, so she wouldn't get frustrated. She just carried her list, adding words as she lost her ability to recall them without the aide. I told her that made her pretty smart. She told me it was a pretty annoying thing to not be able to remember the word \"muffin\". Betty was beautiful, and it was obvious, even at 91 that she had been an athlete, and not surprising at all that she didn't stop playing tennis until she was 82. She was an artist, painting large canvases with all of the joy that color brings; the blues of the coast and the flowers of the field. Though her canvases grew smaller over the years, her love of color grew bolder, and her hand more free. I enjoyed every painting of hers I ever saw. She loved my little girl, and was so, so pleased when I became pregnant with Lucy. She was so thrilled when she found out that Lucy was Lucy and not Lance or Lucas. And her eyes twinkled every single time I brought Lucy to see her. She marveled at my husband's role in our family, ever impressed that he both went to work every day to provide resource for our family and managed to change diapers and bathe children when he came home. She said quite often that I had clearly chosen an amazing mate. (It is nice to be externally reminded sometimes.) Betty had a great sense of humor, or at least one that I appreciated because she laughed at all my jokes, and was wry and dry right back to me. She hated being old, which comforts me knowing that she doesn't need to suffer through it anymore. She was never in poor health that I saw, not really, but she was bored with an active mind and a body that wouldn't jump and leap as it had in youth. Since she couldn't run about as she had, she read, sometimes 20 books in a month. Betty reminded me of my grandmother Lotte, a woman I miss every single day of my life. I felt so privileged, so lucky, to be able to have met a second woman who had so many qualities I admire. She was a good friend to Marie, and ostensibly a loving mother, who raised three very independent daughters. She was a good friend to me, always speaking frankly, openly, asking direct questions about Jake and always offering suggestions or encouragement. Betty loved hearing stories about Jake's successes, and she always, always, asked about this health and development if I did not offer the information. She loved beauty and color and music and filled her life, and even her small room with all of those things. There are lots of things I will never know about Betty. She wasn't really my grandmother. I just borrowed her for a time. I somehow doubt her family will even contact me, although I left my information. I was just the library book delivery girl to their mother. They do not live near here, so they don't know that we visited once a month for nearly five years, that she knows so much about my life, that she encouraged me to have another child, even knowing that it was a scary, possibility that I would have another child with special needs. They don't know that she wept when she found out that Lucy was \"just fine\", and got weepy when Lucy said \"Hi Betty.\" They don't know that she gave my daughter a first birthday card and that we exchanged Christmas gifts. They probably don't know that Lucy and I made special trips to the flower shop for Thanksgiving, and Christmas, Valentine's, Easter and Mother's day, where Lucy picked out flowers or plants to give Ms Betty and Ms Marie. It doesn't matter that they don't know those things, as long as Betty knew that we loved her, and I think she did. I hope she did.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/05/my-friend-betty.html", "title": "\nMy Friend Betty\n"},

I think an outside set of eyes can help determine a good home/school plan that will help him keep moving onward and upward which he seems to be doing lately. He went on the second grade field trip at school. The entire second grade went to a local children's discovery museum. I was actually a chaperon and had not just Jake, but TWO other boys in my group. Anna, Jake's regular aide was out sick, so Lala went with us. She was great with him, and it allowed me to actually have this small but \"mixed\" group. Of course one of the kids was George, Jake's buddy from the other classroom. He continues to be one of the nicest children I have even met. The other boy was Freddo, who I had never met before. He was shy at first and rode to the museum on the school bus..but he asked to ride home in my van with Jake. It could have had something to do with the little tv showing ShrekII, but I will take it how I can get it. Jake was such a good boy all day. I think he was thrilled to have his friends in the car with us, and I think I may try to take all three boys to Gilroy Gardens or some other fun over the summer. I have always thought the the children at Jake's school were nice kids. Of course there are going to be a few bad eggs, but on the whole, well-mannered, well groomed, good spirited kids. I was thrilled to see all of \"our\" second graders behaving so well at the museum. I watched with dismay those kids from another school not sharing, blocking the stairs, pushing each other, running inside and generally not saying excuse me if they stepped on your toes. One of our kids asked so nicely to use a toy (that the other child had TWO of) and when that child said \"no\", our kid reiterated that he would only have it for a minute, and when the response was still no? Our kid said, well, okay, and pretended-on in his game without the toy,  leaving the other kid standing there with lots of toys and no one to play with. I think I am going to write a letter to our school principle  letting her know just how great our kids were, and how nice it was to see all of the school mission statements being played out in public. To Do: Lucy thank you cards for amazing birthday gifts from friends and family Letter to Jake's principle Call the Director of Special Ed and talk about scheduling evaluations Pack Jake for camp (he leaves this Sunday) Pack Lucy for Cookie and Papa's house (she leaves on Saturday) Pack Jennyalice and Descartes for anniversary trip (leaves on Sunday) Buy a new coffee pot Hey--my dad is in town. He finished up his grades at the college, cleaned up his office and came up here this morning. He will be here until Saturday morning. I believe Lucy is calling him Grappa now. So she has Grandpa, Papa and Grappa, Grandma, Oma and Noni. Pretty lucky kid. I am just so excited that he is here. He is an easy house guest, happily reading on the couch, offering love to children passing by. Tomorrow I will take my dad to coffee so he can meet  Squid ,  Liz ,  Badger , Ep,  Jo  and the incomparable  Barak. [just so you know I had to take a break here because Lucy is doing some self-potty training and decided to drop her drawers in her room , but whne she couldn't find her little potty she bacame upset, and apparently, while I was happily sitting in the backyard on my laptop enjoying a cool breeze.. she crapped all over the place and was very distraught by the mess. So the Daddy hosed the girl and I crawled around and cleaned poop off of every surface where it was, and most surfaces where it wasn't as well. I also scrubbed out the cushion covers from the million dollar glider that is in the room, and her pajamas.. all covered in poo. Who knew that the NT kid would present me with more poo problems than the \"special\" kid?] Lucy goes to her last day of daycare at Nanny Kidwell's house tomorrow. Nanny is moving on to preschool pastures and a matching 401k. Sux for us, but a smart move for her. It has been a great place for Lucy to grow and learn.. and get out of my hair! HA!  We bought Nanny a pretty ring with a blue stone to thank her for her affection, determination, structure and warm heart. I am so glad we got to know her and her two wonderful daughters (who can still babysit!) ***************************** I need to make lists now. Lots of lists.

{"date": "07 July, 2008", "body": "\nwhen you are having as much fun as we've been having. We went to Tahoe last Wednesday night and I am so glad we left for the holiday weekend early. I had Jake's aide at the house keeping the kids busy while we packed the car, Descartes still worked a full day and it only took us 4 hours to get there so we still had an evening with grown ups once we got there. We went to the beach on the third. Baldwin beach, where we  baptized little Lucy  (that seems like a hundred years ago...). It was so great to have Jake be happy, happy and comfortable in/near the water and in the sand (since sorting earth has been a recent favorite past time of his). He waded into the lake, smiled a lot and didn't steal any toys from small children (once we gave him his own shovel). Lucy was very excited, and I am proud to say that as much as she really likes her Sugar Plum Fairy ballet costume, she was even more eager to chase the minnows in the lakeside stream. \"It tickles!\" she exclaimed loudly enough for the minnow to swim away. It is a personal goal of mine to raise a daughter who is just as comfortable in hiking boots as she is in high heels. I am also hoping she can easily tie a tippet to the leader, tie a bow tie and tie an apron. Somehow right? She can choose who she wants to be, but I want her to learn all the parts so she can know what she is and isn't choosing. Does that make sense? Anywhoo. I was thrilled then when the a couple of days later, Lucy stood there in a little dress calling for me to check out the biggest ant she'd ever seen. That's my girl. No Lucy leave the ant alone he doesn't need to be on your finger... It was tiring at the beach, the sun, the altitude, ensuring that one of us was with each kid at all times. They can't really be managed by one person right now. Not with water and parking lots and other families. Descartes was able to give Jake some physical space and let him get about 3 yards away. I let him get to about 5 yards at one point. It's hard to give him the space and independence he so desires without putting us too far back should he need us, quickly as he sometimes does. We're trying, and I know he had a really good time. Of course we should have left 5 minutes earlier, which would have been just a few minutes after I said to Descartes, \"We should go, it's probably about time for Jake to poop, and I don't want to deal with the swim diaper.\" Ah. If I could only listen sometimes...perhaps that will be a gift I receive in my 40s.  That part of the day sucked with a capital SUCK, but I carry wipes and nitrile gloves and baggies and extra pull ups and clothes and a loving husband who is willing to grab any one of those things, or hold a struggling kid even when I use my highly-directive voice. It worked out just fine. We went for a bike ride on the Fourth of July. It was pretty much a perfect day. We moved much faster than vehicular traffic that's for darn sure, and the kids had a giggly, napping sort of time. We rented trailers and bikes because we had been too tired to bring our own, but, as it turns out our bike trailer for Jake is actually a lot taller, longer and perfect for him. His head stuck out the rented trailer so he had no sun shade, and with a flick of his foot his toes could just reach Descartes' back tire. Let me tell you how (not) awesome it is to watch your hypotonic  child throw his foot over the edge of the bike trailer, have his gigantor size 4 shoe get caught under the bar and have his ankle roll around until his foot popped back out. I was riding behind the boys, with Lucy in my trailer, and I was fairly certain that not only was I going to watch my son's foot fly off, but I was possibly going to run it over, thereby making my life truly a horror story. With fairly constant \"reminders\" Jake stayed inside the trailer doing wacky things like nearly lying on his back with his feet at the top,tapping his feet on the bar that attaches the trailer to the bike, and occasionally flipping his $60.00 shoes off. The good news is that the ice cream at Camp Rich was cheap. $2.50 for a huge HUGE kid's scoop, and that pretty made much made us forget that it was really scary. We will probably do it again. Saturday we went to the  South Lake Tahoe rec center park  which is all gated-in HURRAH! I am so happy that people have figured out that parents feel safe when their kids can't run into the parking lot. It has a terrific play structure and swings and a  volleyball court, and picnic tables. Lucy went on the big kid swing for the first time; all by herself with no back-up. I teared-up of course. She never really was a baby, but she is just catapulting past the milestones. Jake spent a lot of time watching everything, sifting through the bark and sand. It is so hard sometimes to help him engage. I took him up on the play structure (something he does on his own at school)but he got panicky before I could help him on the slide. Perhaps he does have some depth perception issues? He did sit really happily cuddled against me on a park bench for a while. That was crazy. It is so uncommon for Jake to sit and cuddle that Jaster and Demanda stayed back, afraid to interrupt the mood. It made me feel very close to him at just the right moment. I have been missing him lately, all the while spending more time than I normally do with him. How is it possible for me to understand him so intimately, guess so many of his needs, and feel so distant from him. note to self: I need to make a list of the things I know make Jake happy, things we can do together since it is all too easy to let him go off on his own, scattering pebbles and sifting the bark out of my flower beds. We had such a nice weekend it was hard to leave, but managed to get it together and head home early Saturday evening. Once again we skipped most of the traffic. Lucy was so tired she whined a lot of the way. Jake just smirked in her direction.   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jennyalice.blogspot.com/2007/06/sprinkle-dont-dunk.html", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SHO7P4RSLVI/AAAAAAAAA2M/FgJ77asmH8U/s1600-h/CIMG5587.JPG", "http://www.recreationintahoe.com/recreation_complex", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SHQz8zkb25I/AAAAAAAAA2U/YszTqErGi90/s1600-h/lucyswing.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/07/time-flies.html", "title": "\nTime flies...\n"},

That's not true. I could do it. I could. but since I haven't in all of these months I am guessing I should just give in on this one. Same thing happened in the backyard.

{"date": "01 July, 2008", "body": "\nfrom before the Holiday weekend: I know there's no use crying over spilt milk.. but is there a caveat for spilled chocolate milk, a full 9 oz of it, streaming across the counter and onto the recently mopped and swept only 5 minutes ago floor? DO you think there is use in crying over that? probably not i s'pose. What about the aide for Jake who just yesterday was so awesome, and on time and great with Jake and Lucy too, and cleaned the counters and the trash heap we had piling up next to the recycling...what about how she sent me a text at 12:49 letting me know she can't make it at 1:00pm. I hate looking for new help.  The last time I posted  an ad for an aide on Craigslist  I got people making horrible rude remarks about my post because I referred to my then 5 1/2 year old son as \"my darling crazy monkey boy\". I created a list of criteria which was honest (wiping buts and noses), and apparently I did not volunteer to pay 20 bucks an hour for a babysitter. Three years ago I was offering $10.00 cash. I know it's not a lot, but we always pay for the hours we book, even if we don't use them, and I didn't want a therapist. You didn't need a MA in Economic theory. I was also quite clear that they would need to have a sense of friggin' humor because that was the only way we were making it through our life with a special needs child. Here's one response I got: Is it just me...or is this woman totally spun? Did anyone read her posting? I mean I realize everyone is different but talk about strange....Actually aside from her bizarre wording and \"humour\" in her posting, I think the humour truly is what she is offering in terms of salary. That little per hour for all of these expectations and demands for a special needs child???!!! This lady truly has lost her marbles. I feel sorry for this child.... That was not even the most cruel. I deleted those because they were too painful. This was the nicest response I got back: Wouldn't it be great if every family with a special needs child had a big fat income and could afford to pay top dollar... There are jobs posted on craigslist that ask for a master's degree and want to pay $12 to $15 an hour. Where is the whining about that? Reality is this family is probably not making enough money to pay somebody $18 per hour. Heck, even the job ads I have read for social service type agencies don't pay that high to work with special needs children. Seneca wants a BA degree for a classroom counselor and is willing to pay a whopping $12 an hour... or check this ad out: Milieu Therapist III: MA or MS degree in a behavioral science subject (child development, psychology, counseling and guidance, early childhood education, human services, nursing, social science, social welfare, social work, sociology) or a BA or BS degree from an accredited college or university with a major in a behavioral science AND four (4) years mental health experience. MTIII: $13.95 + Benefits So hm. $10 an hour,probably cash, tax free money actually works out to more than someone who is required to have a MS or 4 years solid experience working with special needs and they don't even get to make fun trips to the ice cream shop! I think there are a few people on here who think that if they respond to ads saying that rates are really higher than what is being asked for, then they will somehow force higher rates. Sorry. Elementary economics will dictate -- supply and demand. Supply of child care type people is far far far outweighing the demand in the bay area. Just look at the craigslist ads. Tons of people scrambling for a few jobs. You want higher wages for babysitting/nanny work? Eliminate about 70% of the people trying to get these jobs, or create a whole bunch of families that will need the services. That will inflate the wages. If the job ad doesn't suit you, then move on to ads that have a higher dollar pay and good luck getting and keeping them. Also, it is PAINFULLY obvious that the mother has not lost her sense of humor in dealing with life. She clearly loves her \"little man\" or \"monkey boy\" and who the hell are any of you to judge the nicknames? Maybe this little boy named himself monkey boy after curious george or who knows what book or story. You'd all do to lighten up a bit. Her sense of humour was obvious throughout the ad, and spelled out at the end in plain English. Live and let live, little man monkey boy probably feels as loved or more loved than most kids in America. Rock on Monkey Boy's Mamma. Don't let them mess with you. Congrats on the new baby. So we'll see. I am so overwhelmed by the daunting task of learning to trust someone that it makes me want to throw up. Here's another thank you to my husband for working more than full-time to ensure that I don't have to entrust Jake and Lucy's entire development to someone else. What the hell do other parents of special needs kids do when their provider flakes and both parents work? I think this alone keeps me from ever having a job with set hours ever again.

{"date": "12 July, 2008", "body": "\nYeah, Plutarch.  Mestrius Plutarchus  A.D. 46?-c.120 born in Boetia, near  Delphi . (Those are not things I knew 20 minutes ago.) So I was reading  The Art of The Personal Essay  an anthology collected by  Phillip Lopate, and I decided to read Plutarch's  Consolation to His Wife I was moved. I cried. It is an essay intended for his wife regarding the death of their daughter. It is at once, both a reminder of the decorum one should demonstrate, and a letter of thanks to his wife for already displaying all of the traits he so admires in the face of such a great loss. Among other things, it is also an essay that rejoices in the life of their daughter, rather than the life she could have had. I cried. (italics below mine) The two years of her life that intervened must by no means be effaced from our memory but rather reckoned as a pleasure, for they afforded us delight and happiness.  We must never consider a small good as a large evil, nor be ungrateful for what fortune has given us because it has not filled the measure as full as we expected.  Always respectfulness to the divine and a cheerful uncomplaining attitude towards fortune produces fruit that is good and sweet. I found it both comforting and curious to have my daily battle summarized into one sentence; one sentence written 2000 years ago. and there is another passage which was particularly poignant about pitying the child for all that she could have grown to be: If you pity the babe for  departing unmarried and childless, again you have the consolation of knowing that you yourself enjoyed a full share of such experiences. It is not fair to set a high value upon these matters for those who lack them and a low for those who have them. She has arrived where there is no distress; there is no need for us to be distressed. Why should we be afflicted with grief on her account when she herself can experience no grief? The loss of treasures loses its sting when they reach a state to which the sting is no longer appropriate.  It was only of  little things that your Timoxena was deprived, for all she knew was little things, and in little things she took her pleasure.  How can we say that she was deprived of things of which she had no knowledge, no experience, no desire? I do not exactly mean to compare having a child with special needs to losing a child to an early death, the passage merely spoke to me in that I quite often find that the pain I endure is much more about the loss that I perceive...and those are things of which Jake knows very little. It is my pain, not his. \"And so...\" That's what my mom would say.

Friday is the last day of summer school, so I feel like I have about 15 more hours to get everything I need to get done for the next two weeks. Jake starts school again in mid-August, so it's not like I need to fill in a whole lot of time, but it's just enough to remind me that outings with both of my children are a rather daunting task. My stomach just quivered at the thought of trying to take Lucy to swim lessons during those two weeks. Jake hate HATES going there. The giant white dome enclosing a steamy pool and screamy children? What's not to like? Last time I seriously left him in the car playing while I stood at the gate of the swim school, one foot straddling the little line in the cement, demarcating the difference between abandoning my 2 year old with her swim instructor, and leaving an unattended child in a vehicle. At least I had the good parking space. I will not even think about getting Jake's aide here by 8:45am so she can watch him while she swims. I may need to put her lessons on hold for two weeks and risk losing the time slot.  These are the things that people can't even imagine about our lives. The lessons are 30 minutes long. Jake yelled and threw himself down in such a large fashion that he terrified several  children  parents last time. He looked just enough like he was just throwing a temper tantrum (which indeed he was) that I just looked like a bad mom. That's my favorite. 9am and I suck at being a mom. It is such an awesome way to start the day. This evening Descartes and I have been trying to figure out additional strategies to get Lucy to sleep. It is 10:44 and she is still awake in her room. This is after a full day at childcare with all 3 and 4 year olds. I thought this more rigorous childcare would get her more tired, but it seems that she is saying more and more often \"Mommy. I'm not tired.\" This was the age that my parents bought me a 3 foot long, 1 foot deep drawer filled with Superscope Storyteller books and a cassette player. I have been buying these vintage tapes and books in anticipation of this day, hoping that the stories and the independence of using the tape machine would provide my busy little girl the same thrill it gave me, but I'm not sure. The stories are closer to Grimm Fairy tales than soft and lovey Dora and Barney stories.  My favorites were Little Mermaid and The Selfish Giant. In the first story there is no Ariel singing with the fish, instead there is a beautiful woman who loves the Prince so much that she kisses his new bride gently on the forehead and throws herself into the sea, tossing away the witch's knife she was given to kill the bride. Instead of a life of further sadness turned to seafoam, she becomes a Daughter of the Air.  \"We spread the gentle winds of hope. You, poor Little Mermaid have searched for goodness with all your heart. That is why you have become a daughter of the air.\" and apparently, the line that has stuck with me: \"For the Little Mermaid had learned that in the giving of one's self, the greatest reward comes in seeing the happiness of others.\" Apparently I remember a lot from my second year of life. I guess I'd better make these last days of summer count. So tomorrow there will be tape recorder buying and Jake to the aquarium planning.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/07/so-much-to-do.html", "title": "\nSo Much to Do\n"},

Then Lucy and I\u00a0got dressed and Descartes picked us up and\u00a0 off we drove down the road\u00a0 towards the coast. Our destination:\u00a0Portola Redwood State Park. It was a little risky given that Jake was so upset, but \u00a0driving on windy roads in the car, a change of venue and trees generally are all things which make Jake happy. \u00a0We chose a path that looked somewhat wheelchair-able.. Ha HA! Half way in we left the chair at the side of the trail and Jake \u00a0walked holding Daddy's hand. He did very well. We told Jake that if he got tired he could let us know and we would \u00a0just turn around and head back. We walked another 500 yards and he turned Descartes around by the hand and headed back down the trail. He was calm and happy the whole time on the trail. Lucy loved \"camping\". We chose another trail (which was really a service access road, and therefore paved) and walked another mile or so up and down hills with Jake in his wheelchair. Lucy wanted to keep going down the road, but soon she was walking with her eyes closed she was so tired. We packed it up and headed home.\u00a0 Happy Jake played in our backyard, Descartes worked (of course), and I finished up the cake. Lucy slept in the car, and it's a good thing she rested because we went over to Squid's house and Lucy and Mali played like crazy wild creatures, Descartes and I got to talk with grownups (athough Descartes did quite a bit of active parenting) and Jake got to play in the new\u00a0rock garden that I am fairly certain was 'planted'  exclusively  for my child. My children are always happy at the Rosenbergs. Note the picture of Lucy here sporting a hairstyle a la Iz and 1/2 bottle of mousse..and face paint. We thought she looked like the joker.

That's the bad part. The good part is that I was able to pile friends in my car yesterday and wind our way all over the Bay Area. Emerald Hills at Ep's house is a peaceful way to start an October morning. There are quail and deer and birds and had we stayed even a few moments longer we would have heard the bees buzzing in her lavender bushes. It is a slice of country just blocks from my own home. It is one of my new favorite places, which makes sense to me as this is now the second woman that I really like who has owned the house. 280 North is always a beautiful drive. The lanes are wide and the road sweeps in gentle curves back and forth... and people drive fast. I love to drive fast. From the back seat I am asked by Captain Blog \"Are you a lead foot?\" I ease off the pedal as Squid reminds the carload of potential San Bruno area drivers that this particular area is a happy hangout for the Po-lice. I ease our way into a pack of cars who have slowed to 70 and realize that I rarely relax. The Golden Gate Bridge shed its fog for the morning and a necessary potty break landed us in the Vista Point parking lot with clear visibility all the way back to the San Francisco peninsula. I take a short walk around the parking lot and returnto my seat behind the wheel thinking, \"Wow. We sure are lucky aren't we?\" Sebastopol is farther away than I remember, but not so far that my coffee cup still has some warm caffeine when we hit some sort of magical coffee hut/hip people mash-up. I enjoy a Lattacino, which is perfect for me unsweetened with less milk than a latte and more than a cappuccino. There are lots of children with striped tights and layers of clothing. We head into downtown and unleash ourselves on the farmer's market. DT and I debate whether we need to create a makeshift icepack so we can enjoy tasty cheese later at home. We meander about. I eat a peach the size of my daughter's head and buy award winning honey and a loaf of bread which I share a bit of, but mostly I hold it and nibble on it as if it is a lollipop in my hand.  Do I have this out of order already? probably. It was the Sebastopol Art Trails, and at Squid's invitation we (mostly) follow a schedule of bliss which also includes time for amazing artists,  lunch on a patio , a visit to a nursery and because we still had time a new tea house.  One of my favorite stops was  Patrick Amiot and Brigitte Laurent  Their work is fantastic. It is whimsical and interesting and charming and edgy and beautifully painted and I want a sculpture in my front yard. I buy my sister a calendar, and hope that she will know that I wanted to buy her half the art in the place when she opens up the calendar for her birthday (which is today). The countryside was beautiful, and while Squid is the most perfect navigator, I almost think she let me meander a bit on those winding roads purely because I was enjoying the scenery. The grape vines are all turning and the apple trees...the apple trees! Everywhere and loaded, and dropping their fruit. It would have been a good day to be a drifting horse, munching gravensteins here and Mcintosh there.  In  Graton  we viited two artists who share a space, and, I believe a life together,  Lisa Beerntsen  and  Tony Spiers  They also had a beautiful garden.   They have been a part some incredible group art ( Art Farm ) which has been at Burning Man. It was neat to see the art in the studio, because my current life path does not indicate an adventure to Burning Man is going to happen. Lisa's art was very beautiful. In some of the current pieces she had incorporated vintage fabric. I love mixed media in general, and I love fabric even if I will probably never win any prizes for my sewing skills. I'm certain I will always have a pile of fabric in a box. Perhaps someday it will be vintage and I will make a mixed media art piece when I retire to Sebastopol. We also visited Helen Caswell, a beautiful woman with a precious husband. (How many times have I said beautiful?) I would love to be the new renters on their expansive property. I wish she could be in my family, and in an eerie sense I feel like she is. My grandmother was an artist. She was many other things professionally, but I think had she been born in a different time or circumstance she could have made her life as an artist, as Helen has. Sifting through her prints I was amazed to see just so many portraits; so many faces she's painted over the years. I can't imagine having the ability to distinguish each face and render each one so accurately. Don't tell Descartes, but I bought two small prints. They are not originals of course, but I will love them as if they are. Our last art stop of the day was  Rik Olson . A charming man who manages to create beautiful and witty art in so many ways. He is one of the few  masters of wood engraving  left. It is painstaking work, and making color prints takes layers of art. Ep and I discussed the idea of thinking backwards and in steps and decided it will not be my next career. Rik also participated in this really cool benefit  thing where  they made prints using a steamroller .  After breathing in a little bitmore apple-scented air at the Olson studio we went back to downtown Sebastapol and tried  Infusions  The tea selection is amazing here.  Hmm funny here I am getting tired writing, just about the same time I got tired in real life. The end of my story is that I enjoyed a really lovely day with some very lovely people and came home to my son sound asleep, my daughter awake for a potty break and my sweet husband tired, but just happy to see me, and not cranky at all about having watched the kids for more than 12 hours (of nearly all awake time). I got to read Lucy a story then pass out asleep on the couch before Descartes nudged me to go downstairs to bed.  Clean car, good friends, interesting art and a happy family.

It\u00a0 could  be that this is the first true alone time I have had in weeks.\u00a0 I worked on  the book  for a bit. I need to use my bigger screen at home to get the paragraph spacing right, and see the layout.. and try to get the pagination right ( and trimmed so  Squid  doesn't  cil  me.) It is exciting to work on it. I know we don't have an agent.. that there's no flashy book tour, but I feel good knowing that the proceeds all go to  SEPTAR  and there are kids who might read the words on those pages and feel just a little bit better, a little less alone. God willing and the creek don't rise, the book should be available mid-November. Jake and I went to urgent care yesterday. He does not have a broken  meta -tarsal, as was feared. After a few  x-rays  we discovered he had only chipped a little tiny bit off of a little bitty bone. Given that one quarter of all the bones in the human body are in the feet, it is not surprising that he would break something. We are having the convergence I think of a few things: Jake has profound disabilities. He is unable to effectively communicate when he is in danger or injured.\u00a0 Jake does have  cerebral  palsy. We forget this sometimes because he is so physical, and he eats by mouth and he has no tubes or crutches, and mostly does not use a wheelchair. Most of the kids we know with  CP , they are more stereotypical.\u00a0 Jake is an eight year old boy. He loves to climb and jump and explore and race around and feel the dirt between his toes.\u00a0 Jake likes being in  bare feet . I had not actually prepared for weekly urgent care/hospital visits. I did not break any bones until I was 11 I think. By his age I had chipped a tooth, \u00a0and had stitches (once), but I'm pretty sure I didn't break anything until the  roller skating  incident. They used to have speed skate/a race at least once  during  each skate night. I was pretty fast, but not that fast, and was especially not in the winner category when I tripped over my own slates and  landed on my right wrist. \u00a0I also broke my left wrist falling off of  someone's  back in a game of horse (now who the hell was I ever smaller than? Perhaps that's why I fell?), and the third break, on my right arm again was from? I have no idea.

I am well  caffeinated  now, and thus fortified against what this afternoon may bring. Hopefully no  injuries .

{"date": "02 November, 2008", "body": "\n Yesterday actually, but it was really exciting this time.. and made slightly more complicated by the fact that we vote by mail and therefore had to fend off small Halloween-candied grubby fingers from ruining our ballots while we voted.  We dropped our ballots off downtown. We are the County Seat, so there was actually an early voter area open as well. It was so great to see all of those people in line to vote. Hundreds of people in line. Will it be record turn out this year? Wouldn't that be great if every American who is eligible to vote, actually voted? I cannot imagine not voting. I feel like it is one of those things that reminds me of how lucky I am to live in the United States. Did you watch the  John Adams series on HBO ? I cried when they they voted on the resolution to declare independence. The bravery! The courage! And then there's the  women's suffrage movement\u00a0 How could you be a woman and NOT vote? It took until 1920? jeesh.\u00a0 \u00a0 Political discussion is generally interesting in my family (especially with my family of origin). We are an opinionated lot, mostly the type that pays attention to the news, the price of oil, the  DJI\u00a0 We are admittedly, rather homogoneous: white Californians who\u00a0own homes and\u00a0can read, but the differences start after that: private school, public school, GED or college, Christian or Jewish or Uncertain, Pro or Anti Choice, and obviously different generations are in different places in our lives. We are in the midst of health care costs for a disabled child, and wondering about school vouchers, and saving for our children's college education. Perhaps we overlap on capital gains for home sales, and each have an interest in the estate taxes for different reasons. The conversations have finally become a respectful acknowledgement of differences. I *think* that my parents are starting to see that I am not \u00a0\"crazy hippy\" from Berkeley who is  so  liberal I want to live in a  socialist  country. It's possible that they are starting to treat me as if I am merely an adult with a different opinion which has been thought out just as thoroughly as their opinions. I am more liberal than any of my parents, but I laugh because most of the things I think? I \u00a0thought them before I even went to college, which means that they influenced me (and for a longer period of time) \u00a0than four and a half years at Berkeley ever did... it's their own fault for raising me to think (how's that for spin). -------------------- I am sort of feeling like all of the talk from the candidates is just rhetoric. The country is sort of broken right now. We all believe that we are resource depleted or going there, so we are tightening our belts and not spending, which makes stores go out of business which puts factories at a slow down so there are more unemployed people with less money to spend on things. It is a cycle, and in my odd mind it is a cycle that is fixed one person at a time (with some bank bailouts along the way probably). If we believe that things are looking better? Then that little  \"Consumer Confidence Index\" \u00a0will look great and the traders will trade on  that  news. I know it's not as simple as that, and certainly Descartes is trying to ensure that I do not \"do my part\" by buying everything at Target, but I am trying to stay positive. It will NOT be years and years of depression. I cannot bear the idea that the peak of my husband's career will be during the longest economic depression the country has ever seen. I cannot be consumed by the idea that (the collective) we may be the first generation which is less successful than the previous generation, and less financially secure. \u00a0I refuse. I will remain optimistic (is this sounding like more  Jack Handy ?) and I will remain hopeful.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hbo.com/films/johnadams/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_women's_suffrage_in_the_United_States", "http://finance.google.com/finance?client=ob&q=INDEXDJX:DJI", "http://rightwingnuthouse.com/archives/2008/10/09/obama-is-not-a-socialist/", "http://www.conference-board.org/economics/ConsumerConfidence.cfm", "http://jennyalice.blogspot.com/2008/10/jack-handy-by-jennyalice.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/11/we-voted.html", "title": "\nWe Voted!\n"},

Halloween went off fairly well, considering the rain we were expected to have, the disabled kid we have and the crazy week Descartes has had at work. I still don't really like the holiday. I don't like watching children be picky when a kind neighbor offers a bowl of treats, and it equally annoys me when  someone  opens the door with a bowl of candy the size of New Jersey and gives each child a\u00a0 dum   dum   lollipop  and says she needs to save some for the next (non- existent  in these hills) children.

{"date": "10 December, 2008", "body": "\n Wednesday 10:30am annual  IHSS  meeting with Ruth. Jake is at school, Descartes is at work and Lucy is with me.\u00a0 Ruth is a kind, late 50's  ish  woman who speaks carefully and calmly. She listens well, offers words of encouragement and admits easily that my life is harder than she can imagine. She has been a social worker almost as long as I have been alive. Lucy is cranky, getting molars, not sleeping well, and figuring out toilet training on her own, insistent that she does not want any help, and is therefore often found without pants, having used \u00a0said pants to wipe herself. She places dirty clothes and diaper in a nice pile and simply walks away, leaving pee pee diapers, and sadly  poopy  diapers behind. She seems to be in need of an increasing amount food, and when that won't make her happy, candy, especially  PEZ  delivered via Santa head. She has 9am swim lessons on Mondays and Wednesdays, so her hunger,  whininess  and need for a nap are generally at their peak at about 10:15 on those days. I am tired. Lucy woke me up at 4:45am. I get a nervous stomach when I know a social worker is coming to my house because I know the power these people have. \u00a0They control money for services and\u00a0 t hey can take my children away.\u00a0 I never forget this part. So even though I have no reason for someone to take away my kids, I fret until the meeting is at least halfway over. And so, at 10:15am, Lucy is crying for candy, with no pants on, \u00a0and she has left her shoes and socks and pants spread out across the entire living room floor. The pee-pee diaper? She has hidden it somewhere. This is really no big deal. I got Lucy back together, got her a snack of wheat pretzels, cheddar cheese and orange juice and have set her up at her little table with her \"math\" book (Jake's workbook from last year) and several  twistable  crayons, and blank paper on her easel as well. Ruth arrives at 10:29am, with calm, and a sweet smile and a non-judgemental look at my dirty dishes in the sink. I offer her coffee. She says she has just finished a Starbucks and declines. We sit. I get Lucy more snack. Ruth and I talk a bit more. I explain the rough autumn we've had with Jake's never-ending episode, and change of aides. She is empathetic. Lucy crawls up onto the couch and into my lap laying in my arms like a baby. She says \"Momma. Momma.\" over and over again. She says, \"I'm a baby. I need milk from my momma.\" and tries to lift up my shirt. Lucy takes off her shoes and sticks her cold feet up the back of my shirt. Lucy asks for more candy. then more snack. then more crayons.\u00a0 She plays tea party with Ruth, then Lucy goes to her little table and quietly plays for a minute. Ruth and I begin to wrap it up. I am signing papers now when all of a sudden Lucy comes back and sits down on the ottoman and says: Lucy: \"I think we should talk about it.\" Ruth:  (enamored with Lucy)  \"Oh Lucy what would you like to talk about?\" Lucy: \"Hitting.\" Me: \"That's right Lucy we don't hit. We have gentle hands. Hitting isn't kind.\" and then-- Lucy: \"Mommy hits me.\" Ruth: silent Me: \"Lucy, that's not nice to say.\" Lucy: \"Mommy hits me.\" Me:  (now slightly irritated)  \"I hit you? Really?\" Lucy: \"Mommy hits Lucy.\" Me: \"Oh really? Where did I hit you?\" Lucy: \"In the face.\" Ruth: still silent Me:  (now slightly worried)  \"Lucy, Are you telling the truth or are you telling a fib?\" Lucy: \"Mommy hits Lucy in the face.\" Me:\u00a0\"Lucy, okay, Lucy, are you telling the truth or are you telling a fib?\" Lucy:  (laughing and smiling)  \"I telling a FIB.\"\u00a0 Me:  (head in hands.)  \"I cannot wait to tell my social worker brother what Lucy just said in front of you.\" Ruth: \"I didn't believe her for a minute.\" Me: \"And I appreciate that because I know it's your job to believe her.\" Ruth:  (to Lucy)  \"Your mom is never going to let you forget that you just told me that story.\" and so, my daughter's first big whopper was about me hitting her.. in the face, and she told the story to... a social worker.\u00a0 fantastic.\u00a0 We finished signing papers and had a lovely conversation about how I was never hit as a child, so I never had to think about whether this was a particular strategy I would use with my own children, since it was not part of my family's  repertoire , nor was it part of my husband's discipline growing up. We talked about understanding that if someone did not have \u00a0my particular resources: great husband, food in the pantry, running car, money to pay the  mortgage  on the house we own (at least for now!), healthy children, a reliable babysitter, these things make my life easier, and that someone else who  didn't  have these supports might feel like they were at their wit's end with a child like Jake (or LUCY!) and not have any other resource to rely on. \u00a0 And so for now, no one has come to take my children away.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/12/this-really-happened.html", "title": "\nThis Really Happened\n"},

We were driving through Occidental when something just flicked on in her head and she said she needed to stop and go potty. We went in to a  cafe  where there was an antechamber where people squished together waiting for the unisex bathroom. We waited behind a precious French girl and her Momma, chatting away, oblivious that we understood what they were saying until I said \"Oui\" when the little girl asked \"Elle fait besoin d'aller \u00e0 la WC?\" or something like that. The mom smiled a nice smile not one of those how dare you overhear-our-conversation-even-though-we were-talking-about-you-and-to-you-in-another-language looks. ANywhooo.. Lucy went \"peepee in the pot- ty  pee pee in the pot- tee \" (that's a little song now) and as she was exiting the restroom she said in a somewhat loud and certainly enthusiastic voice \"I went pee in the toy-wlet!\" The entire little room (which was now packed!) clapped or cheered or told her congratulations, including a young man who was probably 17-19, and so would normally not care at all about something so  juvenile . He said \"Great job! Congratulations!\" Now that was precious. Okay and precious.. do you want to know precious? Lucy was seriously the sweetest darling at the little birthday party we went to last Saturday. I know it should be no big deal that she went to some  little 3 year old's party, but this little girl Sadie is Lucy's first friend that I had nothing to do with. Yes, I chose the day care, but Lucy made the friend. This is not a younger sister of a special needs sibling who went to early intervention with Jake, or the youngest of my best friend, or the much older kid whose mom I love, or her cousin... Sadie is Lucy's friend. Actually Sadie and Lucy are the best of friends.. frick and frack. they even look alike. So Lucy was invited to Sadie's \"Puppy Party\".  It was a very sweet party. Lucy doesn't have her hat on in that picture, but there were little hats with ears, and oh were they cute. This last photo is Lucy when there was some free play time, which, by the way, was awesome, the whole party was just fun and relaxed. Lucy went inside the house and asked another mommy to help her put on this lovely outfit... clearly she's my daughter. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SdRY45BCxRI/AAAAAAAAB-M/TjT-_HlYq7k/s1600-h/P3220842.JPG", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_toddy", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SdQ8xdTgIOI/AAAAAAAAB9c/ZqhlzmjZ11c/s1600-h/coastonsunday2.jpg", "http://www.yelp.com/biz/howard-station-cafe-occidental", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SdRS2349IQI/AAAAAAAAB-E/7lz3vyK43Ss/s1600-h/P3281054.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SdRMYeMCNAI/AAAAAAAAB9k/_FW5I_ebDtI/s1600-h/P3281120.JPG"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/04/sickness-spring-break-toilet-training.html", "title": "\nSickness, Spring Break, Toilet Training, and Birthdays\n"},

{"date": "14 July, 2009", "body": "\n I was sent a prayer that was attributed to a Saint today, and of course I had to research it; please don't forward me stuff, seriously. As it turns out it was actually a New Age well-wish type thing, but in doing my brief research, I did find another prayer, and while I think I was a little embarrassed***  to post a prayer on my blog it spoke to me: It was written by  St. Teresa of Avila   who lived in the 16th century: Let nothing disturb thee. (Nada te turbe) Let nothing frighten thee. (Nada te espante) All things pass away. (Todo se pasa) God never changes. (Dios no se muda) Patience attains all things. (La paciencia todo lo alcanza) He who has God lacks nothing. (Quien a Dios tiene nada le falta) God alone suffices. (Solo Dios basta) And today it spoke to me, because it feels like there are so many things out of my control in my life right now. I have a little, or even a lot of input into each, but the final way things go is dependent on someone else, and I do not like that feeling. I want to shape or fix or make happen Jake's fall placement for school, my precocious daughter's defiant behavior, my husband's need for a challenging career, the ever-growing amount of paperwork, the budget cuts, my son's toilet training, our summer camping tri p ,   t h e   a m o u n t   I   p a y   V e r i z o n wireless   e a c h   m o n t h . W h e n   I   v i s i t e d   a   p o s s i b l e   n e w   s c h o o l   f o r   J a k e   l a s t   w e e k   I   h a d   an   a m a z i n g   f e e l i n g   o f   h o p e   a n d   o p t i m i s m   f o r   nearly 24 hours, from the time I made that appointment in the afternoon, then the next morning through the interview and the visit to the classroom and the entire drive home. I felt buoyant through phone calls and emails...  until I got an auto-response from the Director of Special Ed saying she was out on vacation (and therefore unable to give approval for Jake to be evaluated by the school).  My day was so carefree. It was shocking how much I got done the night before that visit, how pleasant nearly every moment was, how much easier it was to deal with a pile of dirty dishes, or a child who would not go to bed. Everything felt smooth and shiny. I was saddened to figure out just how much Jake's development and school placement has been weighing on me. That it weighs on me every day and impacts everything I do. I also realized that people who don't experience this feeling really do have different lives, which I like to pretend isn't true. It must be so much easier to go through life like that. I almost remembered that feeling I used to have when Descartes had just finished business school and we were newly married and I had this fantastic career thing going (one that paid me): I used to be invincible. And then that damn auto-responder kicked back that out-of-office message and I was left again with that sinking feeling. And again our fate is left to someone else, no matter how many emails I write, I don't get the final say. I just got an email from another possible placement who welcomes me to visit the school but warns there are no Fall placements available, because of course this is all so last minute. back to my other business now... wish me luck with the patience part. ***I don't think it's a secret that I consider myself a Christian, that I have taken a few leaps of faith, and have even officially joined a church (thanks sister :)), but I think sometimes I am embarrassed by faith because I cannot pin it down or prove it with science. I want to have faith, so I choose to, or I try to be open to receive that gift, but it doesn't always sit well with me, and sometimes I am also quite convinced that I am just a bunch of cells waiting for  apoptosis.  I am not one of those pray on the street types of people. I am not ever quick to think that I know the only way, at least when it comes to religion, and I am quite certain that, having made the choice to believe in a higher power, I am not the one who should judge others.. not who they love, or what they call their God, or how they pray or what they eat or the house they keep. As long as your beliefs don't harm me, or my children.. or your children (and that's a fuzzy line) then believe whatever you want, and let me do the same.    \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_of_%C3%81vila"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/07/hope-fail-wish-cry-pray-wait.html", "title": "\nHope.

I know it's there, but when I see these little boys use longer sentences, learn how to tease their mom, figure out how to share, self-soothe, clamor on to benches and chairs and scooters... it is just amazing. I'm glad I know the sadness of  missing developmental moments, so I can truly be in awe when I see a kid who gets to them, and passes them without blinking. Watching a child hold their own cup...most parents don't really think about that as being a big deal, but Jake couldn't hold his own straw- sippy  cup until after he was two years old, and he still cannot drink from an open top cup. He might never have that skill.. so when I watch Hawk sneak in to the kitchen and get his own cup of water and slurp it down.. I am, of course, mildly irritated by his outright defiance, but so deeply and fully thankful that he can do these things. Jake is finally feeling better after what can only be called a REALLY BAD WEEK or so of not sleeping and thrashing about. He is covered in bruises from dropping to the ground and being manhandled trying to keep him safe, or just do basic custodial care. It was bad, but he has made up for his lack of sleep then by sleeping in until 10 am or later.. in fact he just ran up the stairs.. so I will go give the boy some breakfast. Lucy had her very first day of Summer Camp today. So exciting .. so grown up. I asked her if she was worried, and she said \"If Mali is sad, I will play with her and tell her it is okay.\"  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jennyalice.blogspot.com/2008/06/anniversary-trip-day-one.html", "http://jennyalice.blogspot.com/2008/01/more-rain-more-sister.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/06/superparenting-week-begins.html", "title": "\nSuperparenting Week Begins!\n"},

There are not enough trained professionals to serve all of the families who are affected by autism, and when we can find help, it is often out of reach financially.. because let's face it, if you add \"bridal\" or \"special needs\" in front of anything it costs at least twice as much. There are adults with autism who just need a little help, and there are single-parent families with three autistic children in three places on the spectrum who would certainly benefit from even a few hours of respite or therapy. An Autism Corps could allow parents a break or help an adult with autism live more independently. I know this doesn't address the entire special-needs community, but it's a start. Let's start somewhere.    We welcome feedback from all families affected by autism, and from autistics themselves. How could the Autism Corps make a difference in your life? You can comment below, or even better leave a comment next to  your signature on the petition .    Petition  excerpts:    \"We would like to propose that Michelle Obama meet with Shannon Des Roches Rosa and Jennifer Byde Myers, two parents representing two very different autism families' perspectives, to discuss creating an Autism Corps or other measure that will address one of the most pressing needs of families affected by autism: one-to-one in-home support.         \"We would like to discuss taking those three factors and combining them into a nationwide organization dedicated to training volunteers to aid kids and adults with autism: an Autism Corps, based on the Teach For America urgent action model, to provide autism families in need with between four and fourteen hours of weekly care.\"    Please forward this post to anyone who might be interested.               \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/ask-michelle-obama-to-meet-with-autism-families.html", "http://www.teachforamerica.org/", "http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/ask-michelle-obama-to-meet-with-autism-families.html", "http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/ask-michelle-obama-to-meet-with-autism-families.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/07/because-having-special-needs-kid-and.html", "title": "\nTaking Action: Autism Corps\n"},
{"date": "29 June, 2009", "body": "\n Last night, before she went to sleep I reminded Lucy that she was going to camp this morning, and that her little friend Mali would not be at this session of camp, as she was last week.  Me:    There will be lots of other kids your same age at camp.  Lucy:    (emphatically ) I don't want there to be kids  my  age! Me:    Why not? It will be fun. Lucy:   Because girls my age don't talk. Me:    (sad for her and kind of proud and disturbed all at once)  Oh honey. Lucy:   I want there to be  s omeone like me . I gave her a big squeeze. I changed the conversation to be more about making new friends. I sang her a  Ditty Bops song  and I held her and realized that this will be a long road for her because really, there is no one like her. How many little girls in the whole world live in a little pink room carved out of a bigger room, so small that there is only room for a bed and a fish tank, and a pocket door which she must keep closed to keep her brother who cannot follow rules, or even instructions, from coming in and taking over her little nest? How many other people in the whole world have a brother like Jake, with a mom like Jennyalice and a dad like Descartes? No one. No body, at least, who also has three sets of grandparents, two giant golden retrievers and a scar between her eyes because she ran into the dishwasher at 8 months old. No one who has a mom that drinks and swears like a sailor but makes her say \"Yes, please\" or \"No, thank you\" when answering any question.  I'm being an extremist, but I know that ache of trying to find someone, anyone who was like me with out me needing to change to have that feeling. I am 37 1/2 years old and I finally feel like people see the  real  me most of the time. I keep some things private, even from close friends, out of respect for my marriage, or, more likely my own self-respect, but just recently I feel like I am getting somewhere in my quest to be the same person wherever I go.. and to accept that I might not find anyone like me when I show up somewhere. I used to change who I was to fit in, to feel more comfortable or to make other people feel more okay, but while I am quite certain I am more apt to iron my t-shirt when visiting Southern California, my wrinkle-free look is possibly more to do with an ability to find the time while vacationing to do it rather than a fall to the unrelenting pressure to fit in.  I feel compelled to teach Lucy during every moment, and while doing so I am walking the fine line between raising her to be the best, brightest, leader-of-the-pack,  top-of-the-heap while rewarding humility, honesty, selflessness and grace. How do I encourage her to win  and  to stop and help someone who has fallen on the track?  How do I tell her she is the most beautiful creature I've ever seen without impressing on her all of the vanities that girls engage in today? How do I raise this amazing girl when I am hardly past what I am teaching, and not always living up to my own ideals? [And, as I just re-read this I am a little embarrassed that it is my assumption that she can do all of these things, that it is just a matter of teaching and encouragement, when it is actually possible that she will have no interest or even an aptitude for leading, or helping, or winning or even playing]    \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.lyricsdir.com/the-ditty-bops-wake-up-lyrics.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/06/someone-like-me.html", "title": "\n\"Someone Like Me\"\n"},

I am without childcare this week. Jake's aide spent part of the weekend in the hospital with a high fever, victim of the  flu  (I wonder if she got her flu shot this year?) . She was tested for H1N1 and thankfully does not have it. But back to my point... I have no childcare this week, and I will be fine. The reason it will be okay? I know it's only one week. My husband will take on a bit more of the evening routine, knowing that I will have a little less patience in me after competing the witching hour on my own. He will be kind when he is served the tuna noodle casserole I made yesterday. I can do anything for a week, possibly a year, but what if I felt the desperation of knowing that there was no one to help me...ever... What if I was a single mom? What if I had more kids or more than one child with autism? What if I had to make a choice between spending money on childcare or feeding the child?  An Autism Corps could make a difference for families. It could change the life of adult autistics who just need a little (or a lot) of support. To gain a perspective we don't have, Shannon and I have been joined by  Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg  and  Lindsey Nebeker , two adults on the autism spectrum to work on the Autism Corps strategy. This is important because many adults with autism do not feel represented in the current dialogue.  I am reminded daily by my son's pile of clothes and shoes that are too small, that he will grow to be a man, and that man will still have autism and will still need help. He will also, most likely, out-live me, leaving more than just a week without care.

{"date": "29 July, 2009", "body": "\nI think the visit to the  WunderSkool  for Jake went very very badly. He was agitated and uncooperative and hesitant and  untrusting  for half of the time we were there. He seemed really excited as we drove there, used lots of happy sounds as we entered the office... then poof,  basically non-compliant, \"very busy\" and unable to even go into the classroom or walk. I left to go to the staff room so he could be observed without me around. The director came to me not too many minutes later, \"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but we really don't seem to be able to get him grounded.\" and suggested that maybe we see him another time. I got tears in my eyes. Then I pulled it together, and asked if perhaps I could go to help him transition. She was very kind and said that she is always surprised when children go willingly and comply with all of the demands of strangers, and that perhaps Jake's response was actually more \"typical\". As I gathered my things to walk back to his test classroom, the director said she wanted to see more of the child that I wrote about in my notes to her, and perhaps that would give them a better idea about Jake.  I sort of let it slip out that I have very reasonable expectations that nothing good is ever going to happen for our family.  By the time I began to walk towards the class Jake was actually calming down, walking in the hall with a teacher/aide. I took his hand and we walked nicely to the classroom where I asked if we could work on the computer. The computer is something he loves, and they have spent very little time  on them in his current class. I was hoping he would not be reminded of anything negative, after his rotten summer school experience. He sat attentively in the chair next to me. He signed for more when I asked him if he wanted more music. He touched the mouse when I asked him to touch it if he wanted a new music piece. When the Nutcracker Ballet started playing he started to get up... his sister has a little device that plays this if she picks it up, so recently he's heard that one A LOT. I chose another song for him and he watched the animation on the screen while the music played. Then we \"read\" a book.  Chika   Chika  Boom Boom (they couldn't find Jake's favorite book I hate Brown Bear, Brown Bear, but it was close enough). I read aloud, and at the end of each page I chose a letter and asked him which side of the page the letter was on (remember the letters are all jumbled up on each page?). He got every one right! On the last page I asked Jake where the letters were and he touched his palm down spanning both pages and laughed.  Another child near us started to cry. I asked for \"happy\" and \"sad\" icons, and asked him how the other boy was feeling. He chose sad, then looked sideways at the child.  I asked for \"book\" and \"music\" icons, and asked him which one he wanted to do next. He chose music, then picked up a tambourine and shook it when the music came on. One of the aides asked if he would like to look around the classroom (Jake said \" Yauh \") Then he walked over to one of the tall cubicles and I asked him if he wanted to do some work like the other kids. I sat him down in the child's chair, and sat in the teacher's chair. In front of us were little pretend pieces of watermelon with numbers written on them (laminate cards). I placed two \"slices\" in front of him at a time, and went through all of the numbers 1-10,asking him to choose \"Which one is number __?\" He got them all correct. What was nice is that for one of his responses he sort of flicked the number three card towards me, and one of the aides laughed and said \"Duh mom. I'm done with this project.\" They actually understood Jake's subtle communication is actually real communication with intent.  We moved next to puzzles, and I gave up my seat to one of the aides. They worked on three- piece, large-knob puzzles which Jake has done a million times. I told him, even if he couldn't get the piece into the space, if he picked up a piece and showed us where it went that would count too. He did this twice, but otherwise he actually, eventually, placed all of the pieces into their actual spaces without much help at all. The aide was so patient, and when he got the last one in she asked for a high five, and Jake complied...with two/five. Our visit came to a close, a full 40 minutes late (perhaps that's how long they had tried to calm him down?) I told him we were going to go home, then walked into the office. Of course he had heard \"home\",  but had not been told \"Sit in crowded office while my mom chats with the director\", so he was flailing and stretched himself out across the office floor. He did however lean in to hug the director and both of the classroom teachers with whom he had worked. When I stood to leave he ran to the door of the office and waited, then walked calmly out to the car.   I came home, wrote the thank you email, and then as I hit send, got a call from Jake's school district, who assured me that she was certain that Jake's visit had gone well, despite my story of our visit.  I don't know when we'll hear back. The pit of my stomach is awash in acid, and life goes on: Jake goes to Camp Awesomeness for a week, then our local district begins on Monday the 10 th . I am still trying to decide where to throw thousands of dollars towards Lucy's preschool education, and one of the schools on our short list starts July 31st, and the other has a wait list? Perhaps January (our original plan) may be a better plan.   I just asked Jake if he liked \"that school\". He said, \" Yuh .\" It will all be okay or it won't. ******************* after talking with  Sage  and  Squid , maybe it's possible that the visit didn't go as badly as I think it did, and Jake was able to show them all of who he is, good and bad.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.the-mama.blogspot.com/", "http://www.squidalicious.com/"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/07/only-want-to-say-it-once_29.html", "title": "\nOnly Want to Say It Once.\n"},

{"date": "16 September, 2009", "body": "\nThese are the notes I gave Wonderskool when Jake began school. I just got a copy of proposed goals from the teacher this afternoon, and we will be working on them together tomorrow morning. I got teary when I read her goals for Jake. It is so very clear that they see him, really *see* him.  The teacher wanted a cheat sheet on Jake so they could know a bit more about him before they met him in class, so here is what I sent:    Language    Jake is considered non-verbal, but speaks on occasion. When he does it is relevant, important, clear, and often funny. He has also spoken in Spanish.    He has sworn in frustration and noticed the rainy weather by saying \u201cagua\u201d. He has made commentary about a bad presentation \u201cThat\u2019s stupid.\u201d and expressed affection by saying \u201clove\u201d.    He will say \u201cuh-huh\u201d and \u201cno\u201d at least once a day in response to something, and we have heard him say \u201cMom\u201d more often in recent months. He signs \u201cmore\u201d by using his left hand and tapping it against his side. He does not use any other typical signs.     He will often squint or twitch his eyes closed for a yes response, and when he is happy it is very clear by his utterances.     Physical    Jake comes with a diagnosis of CP, ataxia which basically means he sometimes looks like he walks like a drunk.    When he is more tired his physical disability becomes more pronounced. When he was younger much attention was focused on his physical disability rather than any behavioral or academic issues because we all so desperately wanted him to walk, which he did just after his second birthday. He walked completely independently within that next year, and has slowly mastered many typical milestones: stairs, walking over objects, climbing on top of things (but not ladders) and just recently jumping rather than walking off of a low height.    Jake has low tone, and quite often his slouching and putting a foot up on his chair looks like a behavioral issue, when he is really trying to get more support for his trunk. He will cross mid-line, and uses his right hand almost exclusively, but has very poor bi-lateral coordination and so cannot pedal his tricycle. He has not mastered pincer grasp, but uses it on occasion, and he does not use both hands to carry objects, choosing to rely on his right hand against the item and his body instead.    In the last six months he has finally handed me an object when verbally prompted, and was able to use this skill again with another adult.    Academic    While it can be difficult to assess Jake, we believe he knows his colors, letters and numbers. When completing discrete trial learning so we could get a base line for each color and number he became increasingly bored and non-compliant, so we went back to asking him to choose from a field of four and he has at least 80% accuracy. Of course if you ask him for the red crayon he may take all of the crayons and leave behind the red one, rather than ever hand you the red one himself    He regularly uses icons, and a four-talker output device. He has just moved to an eight-window device.     He does not like hand-over-hand in general, but this often has to do with how much he likes his aide. Because his grip strength is variable, and his fine motor skills are so poor, he does not hold a writing instrument \u201cproperly\u201d, or use scissors.    Two years ago he could not get his hand into a bucket a foot across, and he can now get his hand in and out of a pretzel bag without knocking it off the counter.    Self-care    Jake will help with dressing by putting his head through and placing his arms and legs into the proper parts of the clothing. He cannot pull off his own pants on a regular basis, but when a pair of pants was bothering him recently (tag issues) he was able to remove the pants by himself (but since we did not see him do it, we are just guessing that he used his feet to step on the legs and pull them off).    Jake is not toilet trained, but knows when he is wet/soiled and will often come to us to be changed. He will not eat wearing a wet/soiled diaper, and is showing an increased need for privacy by closing the door after we enter the bathroom. He is probably ready for a timed-void regimen.     Jake does not mind having his hands washed, but he does not ever liked to be held down so washing one hand at a time is the most successful model.    He has a high tolerance for pain, cold and heat, so we make these choices for him. When Jake is in physical pain due to injury he becomes silent and breathes haltingly. He was able to walk around our backyard with a three-inch nail all the way through his foot barely limping. He is constantly covered in bruises, and scratches.    Medical    In addition to typical Autism symptoms, CP ataxia and global developmental delay, Jake also suffers from two other issues.    \u201cEpisodes\u201d    In the past:       Pain from unknown source for 9-11 days every 5-6 weeks \u201cepisodes\u201d resulting in near loss of sleep, severe agitation, self-injurious behavior and complete non-compliance. Jack also suffered from panic attacks, which could blow up into major tantrum/agitation.    Current:            Pain has been partially attributed to migraines. Episodes continue to come every 5-6 weeks; duration has been decreased to 5-6 days.    Severity seems to have diminished slightly. Reduction in symptoms can be attributed to better use of psychotropic drugs (Zoloft, Valium), better communication between home and school (to identify early symptoms) and use of Maxalt, an anti-migraine drug.    Panic attacks have decreased dramatically.                              Jake still has severe agitation during episodes.    ADHD    In the past:       Inability to sit still in school, unable to calm down for dinner at home. Complete inability to eat in public, difficulty being calm enough to safely be a part of the community. Escaping, physical non-compliance led to (mild but constant) injury of both parents. Use of Adderall was ineffective after 6 months, adding late afternoon short-acting Ritalin had mild success.    Current:           Jake now takes 18 milligrams of Concerta which lasts through most of the day without the side effect of aggression or tears as the medicine wears off. Evening (6-8pm) is still difficult because the medicine is out of his system, but his behavior is more manageable and not as dangerous to himself or others. Camping, hiking or other outdoor activities (including a grocery store parking lot!) which are not safely guarded continue to be a problem; Jack\u2019s hand must be held AT ALL TIMES or he will run away.     Social/Family    Jake will greet people by grazing them with his hand, or by looking at them with a sideways glance. He has recently shown much more intimacy with his grandparents, nudging them to hold hands, and leaning in for hugs. If you ask him for a kiss or hug he will lean in if he wants to have it happen, or lean back if he does not. He recognizes familiar people and places, and develops strong attachments to his caretakers. He is a physical child, but won\u2019t hold still for long. He loves to wrestle and be tickled.    He is gentle with his younger sister, and cautious in general around small children.    He smirks when his sister cries to try to get what she wants, or for an unnecessary reason, but is quiet and attentive if someone is hurt.     He enjoys visits to Tahoe to visit his cousins, and likes to watch other kids his age engage in typical behavior. He is not violent towards others, except to flail in an attempt to disengage from the activity if he is in distress.     He will wait until another child abandons a toy before seeking it, but will circle around it while the other child is playing with the toy. He has hidden toys before to make sure no one else gets them (or at least it appears that way.)    When people treat Jake with respect, he normally proves himself to be a sweet boy who enjoys interaction with adults and children.

I brought \"naked\" cupcakes and cans of that pre-fab  icing  with some  knives from Ikea  so each kid could frost their own cupcake. It was very messy, but fun.  What an amazing 9 years it has been. I have learned so much about myself and my abilities and frailties. Jake has grown and learned so many things we were never sure he would learn, and he is hitting another stage of growth... little things, like how he came upstairs for breakfast this morning and sat in his chair to eat, rather than his usual drive-by Cheerio swipe. He stands still to put on his bus harness, and cooperates when getting on his shoes. He is present so much more often these days.. in the moment, and paying attention, wanting to participate, not throwing himself to he ground every 5 minutes because he is so frustrated. He has more patience with us, and smiles more. He put his arm around me when I laid next to him in his bed, and asked for \"moh tic\" when I asked him if he wanted \"more tickles\". He is able to share space with Lucy, allowing her to get close to him, kiss him, hug him and tickle him (and \"help\" open his birthday presents). and he's healthy, and safe and alive, and ours, and we are happy. Today, we are happy.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SsWhF7DdLWI/AAAAAAAACJE/tk9VFqGbCTU/s1600-h/PA014031.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IMS8M?ie=UTF8&tag=jenniferbydem-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0002IMS8M", "http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30096906"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/10/happy-birthday.html", "title": "\nHappy Birthday!\n"},

{"date": "05 October, 2009", "body": "\nStephanie taught me to brush my teeth in the shower for the ultimate in multitasking and to avoid getting breakouts from leftover toothpaste dribble on your chin; that was seventh grade. Kristin tried her best to teach me how to tell time in the first. I learned to love the Dallas Cowboys (or at least the silver pencil from that cool set of NFL pencils) from Craig. And there was that amazing family of singers, Liz, Ann and Mary (and their brothers, Andy, Pete and Jim) who taught me so much about music, harmony and devotion. I learned about Jesus and mayonnaise from Tricia, and went to Hebrew school with Liz. Julie paid me a quarter for each cigarette butt I could find after her infamous high school parties, and I learned how to French kiss from David at the roller skating rink. I figured out you could talk about race without being a racist with Jeff, and that the color of my homecoming date didn't matter to my parents at all when I went with Tom. Jill (or Jiy'l as she called herself then...) taught me how to rat my hair, and I got scared by a movie the first time when I saw Cujo at Claudia's house. Rachel taught me humility and the value of charity, and I learned how to clean up my own high school parties with Kristi. I learned how to hoist sails with Susan, and had my first crush on Jason. Tracy and I wrote so may poems back and forth to each other I'm surprised we don't both work at Hallmark ( Hugh Prather  had *nothin'* on us!), and I bought a bottle of Drakkar Noir for Brian in junior high because I a) loved the smell and b) thought he was wonderful. I loved the way Margot dressed, and swore that I too would wear a scarf someday.  I only began working at the Gap because Emily worked there. She quit right before my first day and I stayed for 11 years. and of course I could go on and on and on, because I rarely meet someone who doesn't teach me something, and most of the time, when I encounter a situation that is similar later in life, I think of that person most every time. Not most times... really, it's every time. So this means that *every time* I hit a note that fills in the chord, whether I am singing with others or the radio, I think of Liz, Ann and Mary (and their brothers, Andy, Pete and Jim), and Tina too, and Jenny and Briana. Every time. That's a lot of people, and it doesn't even count all of the people from college, like Andria, Katie and Susannah and Stacy, and Susan, and Erin, and, and.... then,  not only do I recall their names (or their faces if their names are gone, or the relationship was brief..) but then I wonder where they are, how they're doing, do they have families? Are they happy? so I have decided that Facebook is actually saving me time. At the very least, it is decreasing the amount of mental clutter I sift through daily. It works like this: I reconnected with one of my college boyfriends, even emailed back and forth a bit, looked through each other's photos. Then,  I stopped wondering, every single time I saw a yellow light, whether he was okay, and had figured some things out. He has. He's okay, so I *stopped* worrying every time I saw that yellow light (that trigger is a long story about a car accident he was in with his \"next girlfriend\"...) and that family Liz, Ann and Mary (and their brothers, Andy, Pete and Jim)? They are all great too. And so is Tina. and I know Liz is on a plane to Geneva right now, and that Kristin is having trouble with random texts from Gautamala, and Tom is expecting a baby soon. It's all right here on my laptop. Facebook, holding on to all of that information, all of that history, so I don't need to any more. Thank you Facebook. Thank you.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.gaia.com/quotes/Hugh_Prather"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/10/gift-of-time-from-our-friend-facebook.html", "title": "\nThe Gift of Time, from our Friend Facebook\n"},
{"date": "12 October, 2009", "body": "\nI know I am a bit accident prone. There are a number of reasons...impatience, more things to do than time to do them, over-confidence in ability,  taller/bigger than the average person  (I'm 5'11 so I don't fit as well, into cars for example), and of course the genes I came with that wire me more for a nimble  Scrabble  game than world class goal tending. Still, after all these years I am surprised  when I see blood dripping off my left hand (it is always my right hand attacking the left...perhaps my right hand knows I'm destined to go to hell and is  trying to hack off the offending parts? ) I get  irritated when I run into things, or worse when I find a giant bruise and can't remember where I got it  because I  have run into so many things that day. So there I was again, sewing shears in right hand and blood on my left, dripping onto the fabric below. * fanTAStic *. I took a strip of clean t-shirt that was destined for the rag bag (I had just actually cut it into pieces not 5 minutes before) and tied it around my finger, checked on my son who was playing ever so nicely out  on the  deck. Then I sat down on the bed and cursed a blue streak. ( hmm  I've never actually used that phrase before). I called Descartes and asked if he could work from home so I could avoid taking Jake to the doctor with me... this  story  starts to bore me here, but let me just say that I made an appointment with a doctor in an office for a time that worked that day with childcare, Lucy pick up and our dinner guests. I got a call from the advice nurse, who wanted to know the size, shape, number of blood droplets currently falling etc. Then she  told  me I needed to go to Urgent Care. I assured her that I was  all  taken care of, having smartly made an appointment with  a Medical Doctor. She deflated my triumph with this lovely moment, \"We can't do sutures in the doctor's office.\" I'm sorry.  WTF ? I bet I could drop a few stitches in on the side of a trail, with a regular needle and dental floss (but Wow! would that minty wax hurt!) How is it that doctors don't do stitches anymore? I called back Descartes. He stopped at Ace hardware. I poured rubbing  alcohol over it, pinched it together and he glued it together with  Krazy  Glue . It's not pretty, and it's not completely healed after nearly a week, but it's okay. I'll live (clearly), and I have about $500 more dollars in my pocket for skipping the stitches.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IWDB?ie=UTF8&tag=jennyalice-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00000IWDB", "http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:43-50&version=ESV", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/StNFktWjJsI/AAAAAAAACJc/Aonna173NQ8/s1600-h/twitter10.8.09.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/StPtUc-a-bI/AAAAAAAACJk/35dvz_5tXqs/s1600-h/twitter10.08.09.1.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CNZJA0?ie=UTF8&tag=jennyalice-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001CNZJA0"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/10/just-glue-it.html", "title": "\nJust Glue It\n"},

I told the restaurant that it was our anniversary and we had a great table and were each promptly served a glass of champagne. I love champagne, and I really appreciate it when businesses do that one small thing that can make a customer feel special. It probably did not cost them very much for that champagne, but I will happily recommend the restaurant to anyone. We took CalTrain home, it had been our plan all along, but it felt rather decadent, almost as good as a car and driver. Unfortunately I had us waiting for a week-day scheduled train and it was a Saturday.  The ten minutes we left the tracks so I could use the bathroom was the time when the train actually came... so we waited another 45 minutes or so, chatting on a bench.

{"date": "29 September, 2009", "body": "\n \"He walked around the school and played soccer (kicking the ball towards the goal). He had a good day. He ate yogurt with the spoon, a little messy, but he ate independently.\" So I am calling that a good note home. Jake has been so happy, and calm when he comes home. Tired I'm sure, but a happier child in general. We've been able to walk him down to the van in the morning (we do this as a family with Lucy still in her pajamas most days...we look pretty darn hilarious.) and walk him back up at the end of the day. He has walked nicely to Lucy's class to pick her up after school, playing on the kiddie carpet while we pack up her things each day.  Lucy is thriving at school. Wednesdays we've added soccer, which she love *loves*. She is just growing up so quickly.. how cliche is that? We just finished watching The Wizard of Oz with her. She really enjoyed it, and when I told her I didn't like the flying monkeys when I was younger she reminded me that a) she is very brave, and b) it is just television. It was a great experience to sit on the couch with Descartes and Lucy and eat popcorn and watch a movie like that. Perhaps this next year will provide an opportunity for Jake to do something similar. He is much better in theaters than Lucy, but it would be so lovely to snuggle as a family. Jake turns 9 on Thursday. Nine Years Old. Wow.  Finding a gift for him has always been difficult, or at least it's been hard since he officially left the baby years. This year I think we've decided that we want to get him this  bike trailer  by Wike. We have the smaller version which he can cram himself into, but it really can't be comfortable for him. He loves to go on bike rides, but I don't see him having that physical capability for awhile, if ever. That is just a lot of coordination. One set of grandparents offered to send him to Winter respite camp, but I am so ticked off at that camp that I really don't want to  participate in their shenanigans  until they get it together (or at least until I break down and try to get Jake into Summer camp.) I am sick SICK about it.  Actually, it's sort of my \"perfect storm\" time of year. With school starting and crazy weather and that unfinished summer to-do list. It's  always hard for me . I definitely have more optimism and a stronger sense that we are on the right track with Jake, but birthdays are milestones none the less, and I cannot help but note where we are, where we're going and what the road looks like these days. And while I had great intentions, time crept up again, and  Jake currently has no birthday party planned, and on his actual birthday I won't be with him.  My parents are coming into town on Thursday so we will get together with Descartes' parents to celebrate Jake this weekend. This means sometime between now and Saturday at noon I need to make cupcakes for Jake's class (for Thursday) and a chocolate cake for the family celebration. Lucy has suggested a Thomas the Train cake. Right now we are looking at Duncan Hines.  Despite sounding cranky and awful, I really am feeling happy and hopeful. I'm guessing this time next week I won't remember any of this current anxiety.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SsLjxD-eItI/AAAAAAAACI8/Q_iM5RuNI18/s1600-h/0929091535.jpg", "http://www.wicycle.com/special_needs_large_bicycle_trailer.php", "http://www.squidalicious.com/2009/09/camp-irony.html", "http://jennyalice.blogspot.com/2007/09/jakes-birthday.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/09/note-from-jakes-teacher.html", "title": "\nA note from Jake's Teacher\n"},

{"date": "06 November, 2009", "body": "\n I heard a story of transformation last night that brought me to tears. I have said many times about how different the road ends up looking when you have a child with special needs. Sometimes, many times, nothing looks  the way you had envisioned your future, not the number of children you decided to have, or the kind of home you thought you'd live in, or the travel you thought you'd take, or the career choices you would have made, or the activities you thought would occupy your time. Most of the changes in our life are for the better, or have made me a better person, and the woman who spoke last night shared her journey of youth to adulthood, to parenting, to special needs parenting, and ultimately to a place that is taking some of those dreams and hopes she had as a young woman and moving the pieces around so that some of it will work again in this so-different life she now has. It was inspiring, and courageous and a joy to witness. I hope each of my friends has a similar reawakening. In our own corner of the sky, Descartes has been researching \"adventure vehicles\" or at least that's what I am calling them. They look a bit like  this  or like  this . Could be the perfect way to go camping with Jake and Lucy. We aren't gonna be the family that takes a year off and travels around the world with the kids. As adventurous as Jake is with trying food, I don't think he would be happy with that much constant change. Maybe Lucy and Mommy can take a few  adventure trips out of country  when she is older, but we need to figure out what our family looks like if it doesn't look like all of the things Descartes and I planned. Off-the-beaten-path camping might be a happy thing. Descartes and I have sort of decided that we are going to try to take our kids to as many  National Parks  as they will tolerate before they start leaving home. Descartes' family was sort of a road tripping family, and while I think my mother would rather eat dirt than sleep on it, we did our share of National Parks when I was a kid too. As a family, we've already been to  Point Reyes ,  Muir Woods ,  Golden Gate , and   Yosemite , and Jake has also been to  Fort Point ,  Alcatraz ,  Pinnacles ,  Lassen ,  Yellowstone , and  Grand  Teton . In fact, Jake took some of his last baby steps right on the boardwalk next to  Old Faithful . The day we got home from Montana he walked by himself across the living room (he was two) For some unknown reason a subscription of Golf Magazine recently started coming to my house. I canceled it this morning.

They called him \"The Old Guy\" because he was 31 years old.  We called him Grandpa Vic, but his given name was Joseph Victor Aloysius Bell, and he lived through that  first wave of soldiers  who hit the northern coast of France on D-day. He was a radio guy, a Tech5 which is a corporal I think, and he apparently connected calls to  General George S. Patton  many times. My mom says he didn't tell many of the bad stories about war, only the interesting ones (watching three beautiful girls walk arm in arm on the streets of Paris, each with a different shade of hair: two of which were blue and red). He shared with my mom only one story that was not all rosy: Their unit had been bombed heavily, and one (very) young man was shell-shocked, crying, screaming- hysterical. Apparently my Grandfather slapped the young man across the face then rocked the lad in his arms like a baby until he finally calmed down much later. Most of my memories of Grandpa Vic need prompting; he died when I was in third grade. I do however remember the smell of his pipe, and the neat little cabinet he had to put his pipe and tobacco in. I remember his sparkly eyes and handsome smile. My brother has inherited his beautiful wavy hair that looks combed all the time, and a body that always looks strong. I may not remember that much, but I do remember he loved my mom. He loved her so much that I can recall the way he looked at her and spoke to her. I know that feeling now that I have my own children:  he loved her like  he was amazed she existed,  every time he looked at her . I honor him today, and my great grandfather Jack who served in WWI, although I suppose I should remember them officially on Memorial day since they have long passed from this life. My \" Unka   Dunka \" who served in Desert Storm and whose body has never quite recovered from his injuries there, still soldiers on, soldiering from such a young age.

I could not delete some of those emails fast enough, and not just because I did not want to get caught, but because I did not need to have \"that kind of stuff\" in my head.

(Now that we have children we have fallen off the early adopters program and get teased *before we even leave the store* about how  smal  our flat screen television is.. thank you  Sage's husband, Pops! ) I'm always slightly terrified when I exit out      of Word and it asks me if I want to save any changes to my ten page research      paper that I swear I did not make any changes to. \"Do not machine      wash or tumble dry\" means I will never wash this --  ever .   I hate when I just      miss a call by the last ring: Hello? Hello?, but when I      immediately call back, it rings nine times and goes to voicemail.  What'd  you      do after I didn't answer? Drop the phone and run away?  (this is actually my brother's biggest pet peeve) I hate      leaving my house confident and looking good and then not seeing anyone of      importance the entire day. What a waste. I keep some people's      phone numbers in my phone just so I know not to answer when they      call.  (I am not this evil..ever, well, almost never...) My 4-year old son asked me in the car the other day \"Dad      what would happen if you ran over a ninja?\"  How the hell do I      respond to that?  (with Lucy we get questions like: Who will I live with when I get older? How will I know when it's time to live with someone besides my mom and dad?) I think the freezer deserves a light as      well.  (actually, my freezer does have a light, and a seat heater and a moon roof. This list writer must have the next version down from mine. That always happens to my dad. If he did buy the version with the light in the freezer, it would malfunction and melt everything in the freezer, or his moon roof would leak and ruin the upholstery.) I disagree with Kay Jewelers. I would bet on any given      Friday or Saturday night more kisses begin with Miller Lites than a      \"K\".  (I just recently understood this commercial, having heard it for years and thinking they meant, literally, \"every kiss begins with Kay\". I thought that was a sad statement that it took jewelery for anyone in the world to kiss... what they  meant  was the play on words that \"every kiss begins with :K:\"  the letter  duh. the word kiss begins with the letter :k:  AND  the jewelry store Kay Jewelers begins with the letter :k:  Uhm  yeah.. I am still a bit stunned how not smart that whole thing makes me feel.) ********************* In other news, the book  My Baby Rides the Short Bus: The Unabashedly Human Experience of Raising Kids with Disabilities  has just arrived at my house. My dear  Squid  and I each have a piece in this amazing book. I am so honored to have been included amongst these very real stories. My mom just called and told me it is a \"box of Kleenex\" kind of book, which makes sense to me since she is Grandma and can't \"fix\" anything for anyone in this entire book, including her own daughter's life. I have developed a small part of me that has grace (it's still really very small, but I am trying). This part of me feels very badly for my mom, and others in her position. They grieve once for their children, and how hard their lives have become, and they grieve again for the disabilities of their grandchild, and all of the dreams they had to do those grandparent-type things like take a child to her first opera and take a jaunt on an overnight train and go to Paris (okay I was lucky.. those are things I did with  my  grandmother).  I haven't read very much of the book yet as I have been trying to organize my time all over again having added a new regular work gig to my already pressing desire to be a good parent and better-than-mediocre wife while attempting to not epic fail as El  Presidente  of the Special Ed PTA. It will all come together or it won't, and the book will get read in the car at stoplights and on trips to Tahoe I suppose, but I am very excited about it. I ripped open the package and read Squid's entire story.  She is really a great writer  and I am more than flattered that part of her story is about the time we first met. It is a rather precious story, and when I am reminded of it it makes me smile and be so thankful for this wonderful community. ********** We're good.

{"date": "14 December, 2009", "body": "\nLucy just spotted a shattered glass in the china cabinet. It's really surprising it's taken this long to have something break in there considering the fragile contents, and the fact that the china cabinet is still standing at all is rather amazing since it is seems to be in the direct path of most children who visit the house, and is on Jake's twirly evening path when he starts doing laps around the upstairs. The china cabinet has been in my family for years and years. I think I am at least the fourth generation to have it in my house. It's filled with tea cups from my great, great aunts, and old keys Descartes and I found in a flea market in Nice, and a dashboard hula girl I use to determine whether we've had an earthquake (is she shimmying?), and a  raku  duck from Canada and the champagne glasses we used to toast our future on our wedding day. It was one of those  beautiful Flutes  that must have fallen over last night when Jake used the china cabinet as a  football training sled . It fell on to a rocks glass of unknown origin, and cracked the smaller glass into multiple pieces of jagged expensive lead crystal. I found the key to the old lock in a bowl on top of the cabinet and opened up the doors. Lucy was so excited to see inside. I showed her the artifacts of my life while she held the little key to the cabinet. She ran her little fingers over hand blown glass, and we talked about the words \"mementos\" and \"keepsakes\". We talked about champagne and  raku  ducks, and caring for things so we can pass them on to the next generation. Then Lucy dropped the key into a little toy bucket that happened to be on the floor near the cabinet. \"We can put the key in there mom, and Jake will never find it  because he's not smart .\" My heart shattered. I got tears in my eyes and a lump in my stomach. She knew by my face she had done something wrong. She immediately asked to \"stop playing glasses and eat some pancakes.\" I asked her to come sit with me for a minute to talk about what she had said and she didn't want to. She was visibly uncomfortable. I wasn't angry, I just wanted to talk with her. I know children are mean to  each other  all the time. My brother called me stupid and ugly, and many other nasty things when we were  tweens   and though it is extremely rare now, I'm sure he's called me a bitch more than once in the last ten years, and I know he loves me. I know we say mean things about each other all the time, but Lucy has never made a comment about Jake's disabilities except to tell Grandma once, \" Uhm , hims doesn't talk so much.\" So I convinced her to sit in my lap, and I asked her to not ever call her brother stupid again. She got very defensive and said, \"I did not say he was stupid, I said he wasn't smart!\" Which shows you exactly how I heard the words. Which of course sent me down a rabbit hole worrying that I had actually added negative vocabulary..blah blah blah. and so I gave her a quick couple sentences... \"We don't always know how much Jake knows because he has a hard time communicating with us, so it's possible, indeed likely, that he understands a lot more than we think.\" and \"There are going to be people out in the world who are not going to be kind to our family or to Jake because they will think he's different, but you are supposed to be on his team, so please don't ever say words like that again.\" and innocently she said, \"I'm sorry mommy, I just wanted to hide the key so Jake wouldn't get into the cabinet and hurt himself on the glass.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raku_ware", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006V65HU?ie=UTF8&tag=jenniferbydem-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0006V65HU", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PPEH7Q?ie=UTF8&tag=jenniferbydem-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001PPEH7Q"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/12/shattered.html", "title": "\nShattered\n"},
{"date": "08 January, 2010", "body": "\n So there was this whole \"Holiday Season\" thing, which made me realize a few things: I am incredibly blessed, and to find myself going from  Honolulu's 82 degree sandy beaches  to the shores of Lake Tahoe all in a two week period? That is truly amazing. To the left is a photo of  Mokolii  in Kaneohe Bay. We went on a little driving tour to get Lucy to take a nap. I love my family. I was able to see 4 out of 5 siblings, and their spouses and children. Plus all sorts of parents. We are really all over the place on many topics, but one thread that runs through each  of us, no matter which side, is humor. We are a funny bunch. There isn't a stone face among us. I have laughed and smiled so much lately, and for that I am grateful. Life really is more relaxing when there is a mai-tai in mommy's hand.. or daddy's or both. Descartes and I really like each other. We enjoyed each other's company when we were alone and when we were with my family, and I cannot think of a single disagreement we had then entire holiday break. Now this afternoon was a whole 'nother story. just kiddin'. I don't ever need to swim wi th dolphins ever again. They were cool and all, but after Lucy got bonked in the head (I cannot upload the video clip right now, but I will someday.) I decided that it is sort of like horse back riding for me. I could probably be convinced to do it again, but I will never seek the adventure out on my own (unless I am taking a pack mule into the Grand Canyon, and then, that's a pack mule). That's Lucy being cross-eyed pointing to where the dolphin bonked her, but really the dolphin bonked her on the left side of her head just below her temple. By the way that is a really  *really* awful sound to hear.. you know the sound of a 500+ pound animal bashing its head into the skull of your youngest child. Lucy loves all things dolly and girlie, but she will take. you. down. in a wrestling match. She is truly turning out to be the kind of little girl I hoped we'd help grow. As much as she makes me crazy, she is full of spunk and vigor and beauty and compassion. In Hawaii she kept up in the pool and on the beach with her cousins, all older. She glammed it up with sunglasses and sundresses, but had no trouble covering her entire body with sand, rolling about in its warmth. She was a joy to watch. She had a very hard time when all the slumber parties were over. Jake still really loves off-roading. We went off-roading at  Kualoa Ranch  and were lucky enough to have an entire  Pinzgauer  to ourselves. Jake  was so happy. Lucy loved it too. The best money we have ever spent in Hawaii. I love hearing Jake laugh. He's been laughing and smiling so much lately. He won \"best grandkid\" in Hawaii, due to his complete  lack of crying or tantrums , unlike the other munchkins who each had to be reminded at least once that there is \"no crying in Hawaii.\" He received a lot of praise from my parents and I could tell it made him happy. He was a great kid on the plane both there and back, and of course he loves our drive to Tahoe. We need to buy a small camera. We borrowed one from Descartes' daddy, but it busted itself up half way through the Hawaii trip. I may never get the photos off that card. I realize the more fun we have the less photos we take... or I take at least. I had my camera in my hand the entire time on the off-roading trip so it wouldn't fly away, that's why we have so many from that day, but I really had a great time for two weeks, and the thought of taking out and caring for a camera seemed too much a barrier. I was actually  being  with my family in the present. We came back from Hawaii, unpacked our shorts and threw in sweaters and long johns and went to Tahoe the next day? the day after? For New Year's Eve we somehow convinced Nonie and Bob Bob to watch all four of our children and Jaster, Demanda, Descartes and I went to downtown South Lake at State Line. I cannot remember the last time I laughed that much in a single night. We played Taboo! for a long time and I'm not sure why but it turned my husband into the most hysterically funny super competitive crazy person. I'm sure the cocktails helped. Next year we are going to send the grandparents to the hotel with the kids and stay at home with the hot tub, the kitchen and the Wii. It was a great way to begin a new year, laughing. And while I had a lovely NYE last year with Squid and Seymour, I must say it was great to wake up to  room service and working plumbing . (I spent New Year's day 2009 cleaning out the pipes in front of my house... so not awesome.) We drove down to  Cabella's in Reno  one day with all of the family in our Adventure van... so cool to have the whole family in one car like that. I sat in \"the mommy seat\" which means I handed out crackers and juice to all 50 kids. Nonie sat in the last row. She gets carsick. We laughed a lot. Our child ren took over a 125000 square foot store with no problem. At one point I am fairly certain they gave my sister 100 tokens for the shooting arcade if she would get the three, three year olds out of the ice fishing tent displays. The weather in Tahoe was beautiful. I love it when we are trying to get  kid to take a nap and we can take a little jaunt up to  Emera ld Bay . That's Fanette Island in the photo. The only island in Lake Tahoe.. and I get to see it when we are just cruising around. jeesh. I am so lucky. My many many thanks so Grandpa PJ and Grandma Corky for the lovely trip to Hawaii and to Jaster and Demanda for hosting us in Tahoe.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S0wRmKcimpI/AAAAAAAACQU/eLXvBxkEU10/s1600-h/PC225140.JPG", "http://www.starwoodhotels.com/luxury/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=376&iATANumber=", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokolii", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S0wQaGNVO0I/AAAAAAAACQE/77FRBAVF6rc/s1600-h/2009-12-21+14.32.33.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S0wT0K2jDsI/AAAAAAAACQc/AWjA3qVAWkk/s1600-h/2009-12-26+16.56.01.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S0wVMLpZJUI/AAAAAAAACQk/OfKekov7ksE/s1600-h/PC225198.jpg", "http://www.kualoa.com/", "http://www.kualoa.com/tours_narrated.htm#jungle", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S0wQ0AIH3LI/AAAAAAAACQM/IM8EPO1rBn8/s1600-h/PC225234.JPG", "http://www.montbleuresort.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S13pUsm0RZI/AAAAAAAACSY/VnyOkA7Zt2Q/s1600-h/IMG_9702.JPG", "http://www.cabelas.com/reno-nevada-store.shtml?cm_mmc=Netcon-_-LocalGoogleMaps-_-RenoNV-_-RenoNV", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S0weB8f7GBI/AAAAAAAACQ0/kbj40N8kMRM/s1600-h/2010-01-01+14.46.30.jpg", "http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=506", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S0wZ1jZtzJI/AAAAAAAACQs/t1Bcv5qodTs/s1600-h/2010-01-02+14.50.46.jpg", "http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=506"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/01/first-there-was-hawaii-no-it-was-santa.html", "title": "\nFirst there was Hawaii...

{"date": "17 November, 2009", "body": "\n I should sleep. My babies are sleeping, my husband is sleeping, the dog passed out hours ago.. and here I am awake and so.. I will post a few photos: Here is Lucy loving  Leelo 's 9 th  Birthday party. Mostly because she got to wrestle all over her Daddy with one of her best friends Mali. Descartes is a very nice Daddy. Jake had a great time at the  party too. He even went into a jumpy house all on his own without any pushing or cajoling, although he preferred lying on his side and having the birthday boy's daddy talk to him through the netting. I think Jake likes all of the vestibular stimulation of a jump house (autism) but dislikes the feeling of instability (cerebral palsy)... kinda sucks when your  comorbids  are in conflict with each other. He usually spends his time at jumpy house parties trying to get behind the giant slides to see the blowers. Over all we had a great time at the party. Lucy was over tired, but generally, it is always just so nice to be with \"our peeps\". We can really be all of ourselves with this group of people, and I think we all co-parent very nicely, providing hugs and hair tousles and chasing random kids back into the room if they have escaped down the hall, praising one special needs kid for helping out another \"more special\" kid. My children feel safe and happy with these people, so Descartes and I do too.  It's also nice that there is a mix of kids; boys and girls and age ranges and  neuro -typical and non-typical development (way to go Rosenberg's for having a great group of friends!) .. and p.s. the staff that was working this particular day was very helpful and actually acted like they liked us, and our kids... and we were not a distraction from their lives. They worked hard and smiled and showed patience for our children. It is just so great to see Jake laugh and smile again. It's like we have our boy back after 2 years. He can go to dinner (twice this weekend), experience new routines, open doors, laugh at his sister. He is growing and learning. I think school is going so well, that even though he may be starting \"an episode\" I think he is handling all of it so much better with the support and structure of school and the happy parents at home, that one dose of  Maxalt  may sweep whatever brain aches are starting to appear. I asked him tonight if his head hurt and he made this weird face, not a yes, but not no either. He's been doing I Dream of Jeanie squints for yes.... but he was trying to answer me. We are going to get there, a little bit at a time. It just feels like we are on track right now, except for the laundry and the dishes, but those things are every day (all day!)... right  now we are even keel, able to take on a smidgen more work or study...or perhaps a touch of relaxation?

It's so ugly that I haven't taken a photo, and probably won't post it because it will require a disclaimer. Here is my artistic attempt using a stock photo from Adam: It didn't actually happen on my watch, and for that I am grateful. Doesn't that sound awful?

{"date": "14 January, 2010", "body": "\n Squid  interviewed me for  this article  about how children like ours handle truly  cold  weather. 1) How do your child's sensory needs color their response to  cold  weather? Jake does not seem to notice hot or  cold , generally speaking. If the covers fall off he curls into a ball. If he's hot in the summer he falls asleep next to his window on the floor. He loves the outdoors more than he dislikes the elements, and would happily play in our backyard well past the time a \"typical\" child would seek warmth. (This is a picture of Jake in our backyard in a little fish pond  we no longer have  because he would get into it whenever he had the chance no matter how cold it was outside.) Because we have to be aware  for  him we try our best to clothe him in the most appropriate outfit for the  cold . I try to wear a similar number of layers and fleece/wool combination so I can help gauge when he might be too hot or too  cold . We spend hundreds of dollars each year to get him the new size of snow overalls (bibs), snow boots and gloves. Of all the children in the (extended) family, it is most important to get Jake's outfit right, since it seems to make or break any snow event for the rest of us. If Jake is not comfortable he will whine or drop to the ground repeatedly until we remove him from the situation or correctly diagnosis his need. Once we figure out the problem, he will generally have a little more patience for us to fix the problem, but if we don't he lets us know he's done. 2) Can you relate a particularly memorable, related incident?' My family loves to ice  fish, and even hosts an ice fishing even each year (you should come... it's great fun!). To get to our favorite lake there is a very short hike, perhaps 30 yards up a berm and over the edge, then there is just a large bowl of flat easy walking. It seemed simple enough, and we really try to do things as a family so we all ventured out. We had a complete outfit for Jake top to bottom, he was even amenable to hats then, and really the only thing that wasn't quite working were his boots. They were just a little bit too big. This would be manageable for most kids, but Jake also has low tone so every step he took his little foot popped out of a boot. Then Descartes tried to carry him, and every other step, a hat, or a glove or a boot would come off. It was mostly funny, but so exhausting. Luckily my husband is strong enough to carry Jake, and we are smart enough to carry extra socks. Jake recovered eventually, but he was so frustrated the day was cut short. (I am pretty certain this is a photo from that day.) 3) Have you had to modify your family's routine or lifestyle (or location) because of your child's response to  cold  weather? We have realized over the years that Jake is happiest with 20 acres at his disposal, his parents watching from a distant perch on the porch of a log cabin. Since we no longer go to Montana every summer (why can't everyone else just stay married dammit? We did!) it is a bit harder to find a free range outdoor spot where we can see him  and  keep him away from traffic. Luckily my sister lives in South Lake Tahoe, with a large back yard and acres of woods behind her house. Descartes and I made a plan several years ago to  move  to Tahoe. We love it there: supportive family, beautiful scenery, reasonable cost of living (compared to the Bay Area). We researched available businesses for sale, did due diligence on a sporting/outfitters store and began looking into financing. We started talking about selling the house.. the whole deal. We went to Tahoe on a Friday night, giddy with our plans, sipping wine and laughing with my sister and brother in law about the great life we would have. In the morning, after a fresh snowfall we went to play in the backyard. We bundled our tiny new baby in a bunting and set her on the snow. All wrapped up she giggled and watched as her brother ran around the yard. Watched as he  flailed  and tore off his hat, and his gloves and hopped out of his boots. We got his boots back on, eventually. We ended up duct taping his gloves onto his jacket with his hands sort of stuck in them. I'm not sure he has ever worn a hat since that day 3 years ago. When the gloves came off again we were done with the whole thing. Exhausted, we stripped Jake down inside the house and realized that we could never live in a climate any less temperate than the Bay Area. Overnight lows in the 30's perhaps, but winter days in the teens?  Though the benefits of family support were so tempting, the idea of epic struggles every single day just to stay safe was just too daunting. If not winter and gloves there would be summer and sunglasses. Tahoe kids wear gloves half the year, and things like hats and sunglasses year round. We were very sad. It is hard for us to admit defeat; we make plans and we execute them. We don't know what our family would be like without autism so we just keep plowing on making choices and dancing through this life, and most of the time we are happy and strong, but sometimes we are stopped. Of course we could make it work, living in a place with \"real\" seasons, but would that be fair to Jake, being tortured daily for months on end? Would it be fair to his younger sister to have to wait 20 more minutes each day while we get her brother dressed, the little girl who already has to \"wait\", \"hold on!\" and \"be patient\" constantly? We still play in the snow, but this New Year's day we  played in the front yard, as close to home as we could be, and instead of wearing gloves Jake just went inside every 15 minutes or so and got warmed up. Sure we missed the big sledding hill, but we made a cool snowman and an ice fort, and all of the kids were happy, which of course, kept all of the parents happy too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S090zP_ifwI/AAAAAAAACSE/Ln8GF_cYTYI/s1600-h/CIMG0727.JPG", "http://www.squidalicious.com/", "http://www.blogher.com/winterproofing-kids-who-dont-get-cold", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S09yXedqOyI/AAAAAAAACR8/3ZmuZ3QvSxU/s1600-h/CIMG1044_2.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S09EwDpflyI/AAAAAAAACRc/YSfdIIa-G6E/s1600-h/jackinthewoods_2.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S13px-wN8_I/AAAAAAAACSg/3UU78AunRc8/s1600-h/IMG_9798.JPG"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/01/hand-hand-frozen-fingers-frozen-thumb.html", "title": "\nHand, Hand, Frozen Fingers, Frozen Thumb\n"},

{"date": "28 January, 2010", "body": "\n (this is cross posted at  (Never) Too Many Cooks  where I had a sneaky little guest post.) My son eats a lot  of food. No really, a lot of food, and since he has a physical disability, he needs quite a bit of help at meal time. Breakfast is always a blur at our house, and in an effort to be most efficient, get out of the house on time, and offer Jake more opportunity for independence, we have tried every cereal on the market. They all end up in little pieces at the bottom of the box, or scattered all over the floor. So we want him to be able to feed himself, and it has to be fast,  and  his sister has to like it. Frustrated by the $4.00 price tag on 5 ounces of granola nuggets, I decided to try to make cereal cookies. This is my first try.  It is basically a takeoff on any oatmeal cookie recipe, with cereal instead of the oatmeal. I use a professional grade KitchenAid stand mixer and aluminum jelly roll (cookie) pans in a non-convection electric oven. Ingredients 3 eggs (I used large, not extra large) 2 sticks of softened butter (I do not ever bake with margarine) 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup white sugar 2T vanilla extract 1 cup white flour 2/3 cup wheat flour 3/4 tsp baking soda 3/4 tsp baking powder 1 15 oz box muesli cereal (I used Safeway brand) 1/4-1/2 cup oatmeal (as much as needed to make the batter more on the stiff side.) Directions Pre-heat oven to 350F Cream butter and sugars Add vanilla Add eggs one at a time, beat until smooth If you are a good person you will sift your flours, baking soda and baking powder. But since you are not a superhuman, just try not to have any hard nuggets of baking soda or baking powder..then with the mixer on a low to medium speed, slowly add the flours, baking soda, and baking powder. Mix in the box of muesli. You could hand mix at this point, but I have a heavy duty stand mixer, so I make it do the work. Add in the oatmeal a little at a time until the cookie dough is more on the stiff side. I use cookie sheets with parchment paper to cook most all of my baked goods. It allows me to place all of the batter onto the sheets, then I can slip baked goods onto the counter and a new sheet with raw dough onto the sheet and pop it back into the oven faster. No lag time between baking and I don't need to get my hands dirty very 13 minutes. I tested three different sizes for the cookies. A 1 tablespoon dough ball makes a normal-size cookie, and was more on the soft side. A 1/2 tablespoon dough ball, made a small cookie, and would probably work just fine for most people, but I really wanted them to be \"one bite\" cookies so there would be less of a chance of my kid taking a bite then dropping the rest. I settled on a fat 1 1/2 tsp. So I just scooped up batter 1 tablespoon at a time and divided it into four little dabs. This made cookies slightly larger than a quarter, which was perfect for my family. Bake cookies for 13 minutes at 350F, slightly less time if you want them softer; we wanted crisp. This recipe makes uhm, a lot of little cookies; it filled a 10 cup container. I do not know how long these keep, they were finished within 3 days. Even my husband ate them (note to self: do not tell husband that muesli has dates or he will never eat them again). I have several other types of  cereal in the cupboard, so I'm going to keep making different kinds until I can find the tastiest, highest protein, lowest cost, batch of breakfast cookies that my family will still eat. Once I figure out a few that work, my goal is to get a ton of cereal on super sale, then spend a day and make batch after batch of breakfast cookies, and freeze them in 1 gallon zip-top bags. I'm sure they will freeze well, since oatmeal cookies do. Of course the way my family mowed through them, it's possible I won't need to freeze any at all.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S2Joa_zPsiI/AAAAAAAACTk/wnT1Da5Uqqw/s1600-h/P1245520.JPG", "http://nevertoomanycooks.blogspot.com/2010/01/breakfast-cookies.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S2JoaR6fwnI/AAAAAAAACTc/z20KDBA2LyA/s1600-h/P1245515.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S2JnWA2rKLI/AAAAAAAACTM/6zWAPX90Cg0/s1600-h/P1245505.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S2JnWlegFHI/AAAAAAAACTU/cQNDRF7a4sM/s1600-h/P1245508.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S2JnVnWen-I/AAAAAAAACTE/vosNeeDJV38/s1600-h/P1245523.JPG"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/01/breakfast-cookies.html", "title": "\nBreakfast Cookies\n"},

I just sort of feel stopped. or stunted. or hesitant. or unsure, or like I am playing it all a little too safe? (the picture to the left is Lucy when she was, uhm, 6 months old? *way* too young to be holding up a helmet that big, but Descartes title this photo \"Safety First\" and it cracks me up every time I see it.)

{"date": "08 February, 2010", "body": "\n lice hives peanut butter hands missing remote controls overflowing trash bins sticky floors There are many other things that disappoint or disturb me, but today, this is the list. Lice After just  having a conversation  about lice my head began to itch. In fact, it itched again just now when I wrote that. The power of the mind eh? I cannot fathom how I would cure Jake of lice should he ever contract it. Even in his sleep he moves pretty fast for a kid with cerebral palsy... dewd you should see him dodge scissors. Hives I did have hives this morning, and now that the Benedryl is wearing off I am beginning to feel the welt rise up again. Becuase, uhm, you now what I was thinking? If it gets too easy, add hives. HIVES! Really God? Really? Has someone set a plague upon my house? Why? Is it all those times I throw my Diet Coke cans away in the trash can when I'm at the gas station, instead of saving them for when I get home to recycle them? I feel really badly about that. Peanut butter hands My sister can't stand banana   hands, I don't deal well with peanut butter hands. I don't know many people who actually enjoy this thing, but peanut butter hands lead to peanut butter walls and peanut butter cars and couches, and one of my dads is anaphylactically, deathly allergic to peanut butter, and while he is not in my home often, he is in my car periodically, and that whole CSI thing reminds me that there is transfer, from one place to another, and that's ALL I NEED TO DO is go and CIL my dad. So poor Jake has to be hand fed his sandwich so as to avoid too much PBT (that's peanut butter transfer), which makes him a bit upset because he thinks he's all cool and independent now that he's 9. Missing remote controls This only happens in my house when Lucy is crying about \"needing\" to watch  Little Bear . The only other time the remote control goes missing is when we want to change the channel. Overflowing trash bins I like to pretend that I don't hang a 33 gallon trash bag off the side of my counter every other day, but it seems there is always a giant black trash bag tucked into a drawer next to the stove. I'm not sure when I started this habit, but I hate emptying the 10 gallon trash can under the sink every five minutes, and going to the large bin outside on the deck seems too dauting for every scrap. Oh and I have a brown paper sack kicking around the kitchen floor too.. for the paper recycling. Sticky floors It's not secret that Jake is a messy eater, and he loves to do drive-by snacking, where he picks food off the counter and marches off throughout the upstairs, and backyard if he can. If he is really hungry, and I am not paying attention for  3 minutes  he has been known to grab a piece of fruit out of the fruit bowl to eat. This is generally fine. Messy-ish, but fine. Unless he gets a home-grown and surprisingly not-sweet tangelo. He took one the other day,  and when I saw his puckery face from across the room I knew exactly what he had tasted. When I went into the hall, I saw the first bite, small, to get through the rind, on the ground. Next there was the actual bite he took which made him pucker. It was spat out on the ground and stepped on with his precious little shoe. Finally there was the rest of the tangelo, lightly clipped by his gigantor foot, the innards of the citrus splayed out across the hardwood like an image from  Wheels of Tragedy . I cannot get the sticky off the floor. Or maybe it's just now on every shoe in the house. Hives Did I already say hives? Okay, must go itch now.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Bear_%28TV_series%29", "http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6728780942571899981#"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/02/things-that-make-me-very-upset.html", "title": "\nThings that Make Me Very Upset\n"},
{"date": "07 February, 2010", "body": "\nI sat there last night frantically trying to finish my work before I threw up on my computer. I thought I was feeling better, but last night was the worst all week. This half-flu half cold thing does not suit me well. I feel just better enough to do things, then I crash and burn. I think I am the kind of person who really needs to, I don't know, break. my. leg. before I slow down. Don't give me half illnesses, because I will still feel full-guilty for not accomplishing things. Then when I half-finish, half the things I should do, it will make me want to crawl under the covers when I eventually am well. I have spent a lot of time with Jake lately since he's been home sick too, and I am just so proud of him, and happy for our family. He's so engaged with the world around him in ways I haven't seen before, or ways I've seen, but now others can see it too. He's tracking conversation and having reactions in the moment, which has happened in the past, but now I feel like he's really \"here\" all the time, and others can see his reactions as well because they aren't as subtle. He laughs at jokes, and smirks and chuckles when Lucy is being a brat about something. He's been following some directions in such a timely manner that it appears he is actually following the direction. We always give him the direction we want verbally, then usually give him a physical prompt to tell him what to do next, but twice this week (at least), I have said to Jake, while he was at the bottom of the stairs \" C'mon  up buddy, it's time for dinner.\" ...and he has come up the stairs and gone to the counter! He has gone into the bathroom with only a verbal prompt, sat down in his chair several times. This bodes well for Jake demonstrating safety awareness. He's also doing a lot better at making choices using icons and the actual item, and of course I am most pleased when he makes choices between my two hands after I tell him what each hand means. \"home\" or \"park\", \"ice cream\" or \"cookie\". The other night Jake came in to my room while I was folding laundry (see mom I do fold laundry sometimes). This was after Jake had gone to his room for the night, but before Lucy and Descartes had come downstairs to \"watch a show\". I asked Jake if he wanted Daddy to come down and watch a show with him and he made his happy \" aYeah !\". Descartes came down and the boys watched  Top Gear  which, along with  Mythbusters  are two, that's right TWO television shows that Jake seems to enjoy. Most people don't actively encourage their kids to watch television, but for Jake to show preference means he is paying attention to what's happening in his environment, and for him to enjoy programming that happen to be two of his dad's favorite shows, provides one more point of contact for engagement. It also means there is one more thing we can add to the (short) list of things grandparents can buy him for Christmas. I discovered Jake likes  Mythbusters  a couple of months ago when he was sitting on the edge of one couch, and Descartes was on the other. I went in to speak with Descartes, sat down on the ottoman, and Jake said, \"Ma-aw\" in a gentle, but irritated voice. I realized that I was in his line of vision. Descartes spouted that I was a better door than a window, Jake laughed as I moved, and then settled down and proceeded to watch the rest of the show! Progress, little steps, a happy child, not-so-stressed-out parents...all very good things. ***** Descartes has just awoken from his  pre -Superbowl nap, so now that he can keep on eye/ear out for Jake who is playing solo in the extra-locked down back yard, I am comfortable crashing in bed for a few more hours. I asked Descartes to record the game so I can watch the commercials later.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.topgear.com/uk/", "http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/mythbusters.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/02/and-shes-out.html", "title": "\nAnd She's Out...\n"},
{"date": "12 February, 2010", "body": "\nLucy is not eating anything anymore. Okay that's not really true, but I just sat down with her and named just about every food on the entire planet in French and English (okay that's not entirely true either).

I am trying really hard not to continue this short order cook thing. I think it's so disrespectful when children won't at least try a bite, but since we aren't sitting down as a family, it's sort of hard to rein in some of this. Jake eats dinner early because he goes to bed early. I've always made Lucy her dinner at the same time, but now I'm realizing that she enjoys eating when Descartes come home, and is often more adventurous with her food if she is eating off of Daddy's plate. and, of course, because I am so trendy, after reading 500+ blogs a day, I started thinking about meal-planning. It seems it's all the rage in \"this economy\". I always sort of have an idea about what's for dinner, but I think it might be healthier for our family and our bank account, if I think about what we are going to eat in a more orderly fashion. The real problem I have right now is that Descartes has created a $40,000 problem at our house. Okay maybe that's also not entirely true, but he's opened up a can of worms for sure. he busted my oven. Not enough so that it doesn't work, just enough so that it's difficult to use. He spilled 8 quarts of boiling corned turkey water on the stovetop above the oven, right after I said \"Be careful not to spill water on the stovetop because if it GETS DOWN INTO THE OVEN TIMER BELOW IT WILL PROBABLY RUIN THE LED.\" And of course that is exactly what happened. Well, first the timer bell went off for an hour, then it stopped, and now I can't read the temperature control. So it's not that the oven itself doesn't work, I just can't tell what the temperature actually is on the outside.  \"Get an oven thermometer\" you say? Yes, I have one, so that tells me when it is near the number I want, then I try to adjust the oven temperature, but sometimes when you press the button it goes back down to 250F, and sometimes it starts where you were, maybe at 350F. S0,  I never know where I am, and it takes about 45 minutes to get the oven to the correct temperature. I use the oven at least once a day if not more. I bake. I cook for my family. I make homemade cookies like Martha Stewart for goodness sake! (Actually I did just make about 100 heart shaped cookies, and it took me over an hour to get the temperature adjusted correctly before I could even start.) So the part is $200+ and the labor would be another $200-300. Maybe more? A new oven is $800-$2000, depending on the one we would want. Of course, I don't want another electric oven, I want a gas oven,  and  I don't want a single oven underneath my cook top, I want a double wall oven. I know wah wah. So you see, I now need to remodel my entire kitchen.. which of course, we cannot afford this decade. I'm thinking about buying a toaster oven, to at least make quick heat up meals for the kids. Maybe I can store it inside the oven.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/02/shopping-list-for-lucy.html", "title": "\nShopping List for Lucy\n"},

It has my  name  on it because it's my business  license , and you can get my information for your check.\" \n \nright. \n \nI read his first name \"Hendry\"  and sort of half-yelled down the stairs at him, \"Is this correct? Hendry?\" \n \n\"Yes ma'am Hendry H E N D R Y. My name is spelled correctly on my business  license .\" \n \nbet that hasn't made life any easier,  huh, Hendry? \n \nI closed the door to head upstairs to get my checkbook. I couldn't hold it in any more and I started to cry, sob really. \n \nI went up the stairs and Lucy rushed over, \"Momma, why are you crying? \n \nuhm. deep breath. I never know quite how I am going to respond to her questions that have *really big* answers, answers that might shape her whole opinion about her brother or his classmates, or the entire world. I must somewhere be practicing speeches, in my restless sleep perhaps... \n \n\"You know how Jake is a special kind of kid? Well, the man at the door came to paint the numbers on our curb so the police and firemen can find our house in an emergency. The man at the door is a grown up who was probably a little bit like Jake when he was little. He was a special kid, and when mom sees a grown up who was probably a special kid like Jake, all grown up with a job, it makes Momma so happy that I cry.\" (She understands the happy crying thing.) \n \n\"You know how it's tough for Jake to do chores at our house, to do jobs at our house? Well, when Jake grows up he will want to have a job, and so it makes Momma really happy to see that kids like Jake can grow up and have jobs.\" \n \nI write the check. Lucy stands next to me. \n \n\"Mom, Jake has jobs at school, right now. He has jobs Momma.\" \n \n\"That's right baby, I guess he does.\" \n \nI finished the check for Hendry and walked it down the three flights of stairs to him. He was sitting in the street, painstakingly painting numbers on my curb. \n \n\"Here's your check. Thank you very much. Do you have a business card, I could recommend you or do you go door to door?\" \n \n\"No ma'am I go  door   to  door. I have my  business  license.\" \n \n\"Yeah, that's a great idea to have that. It makes it very official.\" \n \n\"It  IS  very official. I got it from the city.\" \n \n\"Thanks again.\" \n \nand I made it back into the house before I started to cry again. This time I went to  my room, where Descartes and I had been resting (since we were both sick). I crawled up on to the bed and sobbed. Descartes put his arm around me and pet my hair a little. \n \n\"Do you know why, [ heave ], I'm [ deep breath ] crying?\" \n \n\"Yes dear.\" \n \n\"I'm sorry, I can't seem to stop.\" \n \n\"I know. This is why I don't Twitter.\" \n \n\"Why, because you would have to say something like \"Grown man with autism comes to door, steroid-induced hysterics by wife ensue?\" \n \n\"Something like that.\" \n \n\"I hope he doesn't get run over while he's painting the numbers. That's all I need is to explain to Lucy all about the grown up guy who was like Jake as a kid, who had a job, but is now dead in the street. That would  really   make me cry.\" \n \n\"Yeah, probably.\" \n \n\"Hey, you know? I would be crying even if I weren't on steroids.\" \n \n\"I know. I know. Take a deep breath. It's all good.

{"date": "24 March, 2010", "body": "\ntwo and a half weeks ago... I went to the gym for the first time in over a month. I had the blessing of time combined with a brief moment thinking that I was strong enough to exercise. It was pretty darned funny. I ran a 15 minute mile (actually 1.05 in 14:30) but basically a FIFTEEN MINUTE MILE, and not miles.. I mean ONE MILE because I was tired out. It was very strange. I know I will be back physically in a few weeks to at least my previous sorry state, but it is still amazing how weak I got after not really moving for a month. If nothing else that month of sick has taught me that I never want to be that person who sits around like that... ever. I want to be able to run under a 10 minute mile for most of the rest of my life, and hopefully it will look more like 8? Don't think I am signing up for marathons any time soon, way to trendy for me. Then when it came to weights I had to take ten pounds off of every set. I probably could have pushed through it, but I found myself needing to rest between sets, and I encountered some strange random coughing fits too. All very distressing, but another time in my life where I am thankful for the experience because now that I know what sloth can bring, I do not want to be a part of it. I need to be strong for my children, my husband, and my future home repairs. So while I was on my Super cross-fit tangle your legs and watch CNN while you measure your heart rate and BMI and how far your little man has gone on a mountain or a track or around an island... machine, I heard the differently-modulated voice of a young man come in the weight room. He is probably 17, and I've seen him once before with one of the YMCA staff at his side. The first time I saw him it was his first visit there, and I watched before how he had entered the room, scoped out a machine and been visibly distressed by the fan, which was on behind me. I turned it down for him, and later as I was leaving I complimented the young YMCA employee for working so well with him.  This time was no  different. He has been coming here for months now, and I can tell he has his \"regular machine\" because he waited for someone else to finish their workout, and used the one on the end (away from the fan) when there were other open machines.  He is more comfortable now, and doesn't scan the room as often with unsure eyes. He presses all of the buttons on the machine and they light up consistently, but the employee sticks with him while he works out. This time they are having a conversation, and I am not eavesdropping but I do overhear several snippets. Okay fine... I was listening. \"I would really like it if you could call this woman before my I.P.P.\" (which is really why I started listening, because this young man is perhaps his own advocate, and has an  Individual Program Plan , as my son does, and anytime someone uses jargon that applies to my kid, my ears tune in.) \"Well, I can do that. You can just give me her number.\" \"What time of day would you call her, because the number I give you would be different, if you were calling her in the morning, than if you are going to call in the afternoon. What time of day will you call her tomorrow?\" \"Well, I'm not sure.\" \"Maybe you can think about that.\" \"You could give me both numbers?\" \"Yes. I could give you both.\" And he starts to tell her the numbers. She has to stop him and remind him that she won't be able to remember the numbers, that she'll need something to write them down. He laughs a little, and says something about how both numbers are in his head, \"all the numbers are in my head, really.\" He cross-trains on his machine a bit more, his legs are jerking in a rhythm that is so different than mine even though we are on similar machines. I realize he is walking on his toes, but on an elliptical trainer it makes the legs swing in an odd arc. I can't replicate his movement even though I try. I can't spin plates like Jake either. The trainer says she is going to Chicago next week, so he will need to work with someone else. \"Where in Chicago?\" \"I don't really know. Somewhere in the south side? Something like that.\" \"Well, if it's the south side, there's Wrigleyville, which isn't really a city, but a place, like South Beach in San Francisco.\" \"Have you ever been to Chicago?\" she asks him. \"No\" When I told this story later to my friend Seymour, he noticed easily that the young man has probably mapped the location of every baseball field and their surrounding areas.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ggrc.org/fi_ipp.htm"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/03/i-spy-with-my-little-eye.html", "title": "\nI Spy with My Little Eye\n"},
{"date": "28 March, 2010", "body": "\nHave you ever thought about how language changes? How much faster it changes now that we have all of this technology and life moves so quickly. We add new words to our vocabularies every day, and sometimes words come about because of the actions of a person,  eponyms , which I find fascinating. \n \nThe word lynch? Comes from  Charles Lynch (1736-1796) , a planter and justice  of the peace from Virginia who \"headed an irregular court to punish Loyalist supporters of the  British during the American Revolutionary War.\"  \n \n Etienne de Silhouette  was a French finance minister whose name became associated with these simple pieces of art, and \"anything done or made cheaply\" when he had to make some very tough decisions during a particularly bleak economy in 1700s France. \n \n An abducted child became the \"Amber alert\", a legislator from 7th century B.C. gives us Draconian law, and \n \n I'm afraid the name  Smockity Frocks  may have just become synonymous with someone who judges our special needs children unabashedly, and someome who, even when told of their grave error in mistaking autism for bad manners, has no room in their heart for apologies, only defensiveness.\u00a0 \n \n There has been quite a hullabaloo in the last few days over  Smockity's post,  \"In Which Smockity Considers Jabbing a Ball Point Pen  Into Her Eye\" (which she has since taken down, but is available through a Google cache also: I am not the Jennifer that commented on her post) , and with good reason I think. Her post basically describes an encounter at the local library with what I can only see, by Smockity's own description, is a girl with autism, and her caretaker. It's obvious by the way that Smockity openly mocks the girl and her grandmother's behavior, (while praising her own virtue),\u00a0 that she must not have any idea she is making fun of a disabled person, because who would do that, in public? on their popular website? \n \nAnd I probably would have read the post, possibly commented, then shook my head, knowing that the battles ahead will be many, and that just as we are no where near being color blind in this country, we sure as hell aren't close to tolerating people with disabilities.\u00a0 I would have let it be, and signed it off to ignorance, but the comments! Agh the comments, many, many readers extolling her virtues, her patience, her parenting skills. And perhaps, is it possible that none of those people have ever seen someone with autism either? Or perhaps they think they all look like Rain Man? I doubt it, but perhaps. But when Smockity is gently, very gently, presented with the idea that the child may have been autistic I thought I would see a turn-around, an apology, a paragraph at the top of the post with something like, \"I have left this post up, as a perfect example of how we judge each other without knowing and without love, and perhaps a quote from Matthew 7: \n \u00a0 1 \"Do not judge, or you too will be judged.  2 For in the same way you judge  others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be  measured to you. \u00a0 3 \"Why  do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no  attention to the plank in your own eye?  4 How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take  the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your  own eye?  5 You hypocrite,  first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly  to remove the speck from your brother's eye.  Perhaps a quote from one of her readers \"There are so many lessons in this one experience.\" Or maybe something about how she learned a little bit about herself, and about autism, and about how blessed she is all over again with her beautiful family, who has apparently been untouched by anything outside of the norm neurologically. \n \nI know I would have come up with a few, more than a few, humble words to apologize for hurting so. many. people. And it's not just that she judged this one day in the library, but you know what myfriendConnie? We already don't take Jake to the library because of Smockities like you. And now it makes me wonder where else you are? and it's not just that you hurt us once, but now it is just one more story I sadly add to the mental file labeled \"Painful moments I wish had never happened, or at least I wish I'd never heard about, because now I will always wonder if that's going to happen to me.\" \n \nWhen we took our last big family trip to Hawaii over the holidays, there was a big old Smockity on the plane. He and his wife were sitting four rows from the bathroom, and on the way back to our seats, in the last 45 minutes of our flight after waiting, waiting for the bathroom and being cramped in there with me, Jake just could not take it anymore. As we tried to navigate back to our seats, I was holding back his arms, so he wouldn't touch anyone. I was telling him what a great job he was doing not touching anyone, when he clearly was touching everything he could when he got the chance. Jake broke out of my grip and in his effort to run (CP and all) down the aisle of the plane back to his seat, he put his left hand on that Smockity's shoulder, grazed his arm, touched his newspaper and made a really loud whoop-de whooo. Descartes heard Jake's distress call, got up and guided him the last few rows to his seat. \n \nAs I was running past the man who Jake had touched, not injured, just touched, the smockity man bellowed \"What's wrong with that boy? Why can't you control your son?\" His wife grabbed his arm and said something quickly, but he pulled his arm away from her and continued to glare at me, because of course I was so stunned that I was still standing there. He had decided there was something wrong with my child, and that I was a bad parent all in one fell swoop.\u00a0 I apologized, of course,  because I always apologize for my child's genetic and unalterable neurological condition, because even though we are not supposed to blame ourselves, of course this is my fault, everything about it, because he's my genetic code and I gave birth to him, and I left the house with him.  So, I told the man that Jake is autistic, and asked the man if he was okay. Instead of *any* sign of grace, the smockity man harrumphed at me and went back to his paper. I went back to my seat and sobbed.  \n \nHe saw us again outside, when we were waiting for Jake's wheelchair (which they inconveniently take to the curb in Honolulu). Jake slipped out of my clutches right as the man stepped through the sliding doors. I caught the sleeve of Jake's shirt and yanked him back to me, terrified that two more steps and he would have been under a car rental shuttle bus, or under the smockity man's foot. That man looked right through us. His wife, right behind him, smiled a half smile, which was the probably the best attempt she could make to apologize for her boorish husband. \n \nWant to hear more stories? I have more. We all have them, any of us who have children that are outside of the norm, and these are just the stories of the people who said out loud their disgust or displeasure of having us in their presence. I don't know how many other people we've nearly made poke out their eye with a pen. Smockity's post makes me think there are hundreds, if not thousands more people who have been thinking ill of us and on the verge of self-inflicted blindness. \n \nBut lest you think that the whole world is filled with Smockities, on the return flight home from Hawaii, when Jake was *not* patiently waiting, and just wanted to go into the bathrooms that became available, a woman next to us, and next in line, said, \"Would it be better for him to go next? Would that be better for him?\" and of course I got all teary eyed, because it was the nicest, thing, said in the nicest way. It was also easy for her to give, and probably in her best safety interest since he was beginning to flail, but she didn't need to offer, and she never really even made eye contact with us. She wasn't trying to be friends, or even be the knowing mom, she was just trying to be a decent human being who could offer me this one thing during what was an obviously difficult moment for my kid. \n \nIt doesn't take much to help families like mine feel like we are welcome in the world. Let's start with being more kind. Let's take a deep breath. Let's think about how someone else's life might be very, very, different from our own. \n 1Corinthians 13:12-13  \"For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.  Now I know in part, but then I shall fully know even as I also am fully  known. And now faith, hope, charity, these three remain; but the  greatest of these is charity [love].\" What about this? A little less smockity, and lot more charity. \n \n \n ***********************  \npost script to my post.  On March 30th Smockity Frocks posted this apology on her blog . I sent her a note thanking her for what I believe is a sincere apology. \n        An Apology by  Smockity  Frocks  on  March 30,  2010 From the very beginning, I have always wanted\u00a0this blog to be a  blessing, something to help others, and never to hurt. I wanted to make  people laugh, even in the midst of parenting trials. \nIt has become evident that I have not achieved that goal. I have  unintentionally caused hurt and pain and for that I am truly sorry. \nWhen I described a situation I observed recently, I was seeing in my  mind\u00a0and describing on my blog\u00a0behavior that I have witnessed dozens of  times in my own seven children and hundreds of students during my eight  years as a school teacher.\u00a0 The behavior I described was nothing more to  me than childishness and impatience, but I can see now that the words I  used were viewed as symptoms of autism and many people were offended. \nThe most grievous part, for me, is that this has brought dishonor to  the name of Christ, and that is wholly the opposite of my life\u2019s  mission. \nIt is my\u00a0sincere hope that this apology will bring healing and peace. \nGiven the nature of many of the emails I have received, please  understand why I feel it is necessary to close the comments on this  post. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_eponyms", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lynch_%28jurist%29", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_de_Silhouette", "http://www.smockityfrocks.com/", "http://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B5C2Ta2YGCfTYmRhOTliZTUtNjQ5ZC00MmNjLWJmYzItNWU5MjNlYzU4ZTc3&hl=en", "http://www.smockityfrocks.com/2010/03/an-apology.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/03/how-persons-name-becomes-adjective.html", "title": "\nHow a Person's Name Becomes an Adjective.\n"},
{"date": "30 March, 2010", "body": "\nI have always  been a people watcher, on the lookout for future story characters, or  friends, or mates (less of that now Honey, I swear). Lately I feel like  I've seen more young adults on the spectrum out and about. It may be  that I am searching for them now, slightly more aware than by pure subconscious perception, but not quite actively. I look for taller versions of my son as I watch Jake sprout up, knowing he  will be 6'5\" before I know it. I've been able to spot the little kids  for awhile, sometimes before their own parents recognize the signs, but I realize now I've slowly been looking for those tweens on the spectrum, those kids who are just a bit older than Jake (that picture of Jake over there? I think he's not yet 2?) \n *****  \n I  like to be prepared. My sister, Demanda, laughs at me sometimes when we are about to embark on an adventure of some sort. She can see what others may not notice: I am assessing a situation to figure out what disaster could/will  befall us. Then she laughs a little more because she knows what disaster I'm  going to say because she quite often thinks the same way (perhaps a  product of growing up under my \"Lives like Y2K is around the corner\"  father's roof). Being prepared makes me feel safe, and calmed somewhere  in my racing mind. I do however understand the joy of spontaneity, which is why we  have snacks, sunblock, extra clothing, diapers, wipes, medication and  water in our car. I want to think I can just switch plans at a moment's  notice, but still take care of the basics. This, by the way, is actually not spontaneity, but it's as close as I get. \n \n \nMy  point here was, uhm, oh yes, my point is, I want to prepare for Jake getting older, but he is one thing I  have a hard time preparing for. We never thought he'd walk, and he did.  We never thought he'd hold his own cup, and he does. We never thought  he would engage and he does, more and more each day. I don't know what  kind of older person to look for as a guide for us for Jake because, thankfully, he is growing and  changing and learning every day. \n \nWhat's really hard is that I  don't want to be pessimistic, and research options for living and care  that are too restrictive or overly supported. I also don't want to be  unsure of my ability to care for  a 180 pound 16 year old, or a 220  pound grown man. \n \nMany of the resources, the good ones, with peers and  outings and support and a safe environment are small, hard to find, and  harder to get into. I am going to need to pay attention now or soon if I  want Jake to have \"independence\" living apart from his parents when  he's 19 or 26 or 33. Of course, I also can't bear the thought of someone else not caring for him properly.  \n \nI'm realizing right this moment, as I write  this, that I am not really ready to think about any of that yet. I want  to. I want to have all the facts; have all the files ready to go. I want  to prepare for his future, but it triggers so many other things, like  money and health care, and we need to make a trust, and a will, and ugh, I forgot to put the clothes from the washer into the dryer, so hopefully they haven't soured since this morning. \n \n And more than all that, if Jake is grown up than that makes Lucy grown up, and there I go into the  rabbit hole: we aren't having any more kids, and here I am crying  again, because there is something I just cannot let go there. More kids...no, that would be irresponsible.. but wait, no, but wait... \n \nEverything is JUST. SO. BIG. so many things to think about, emotions to sort through, financial decisions to make. I feel like I need to start so many things, but in so many different directions. \n \nSo for today I will go as far as seeing older kids on the  playground or at the gym, or at the store, and  I'll stop there for now so I  can prepare to prepare. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S6w3qTdvrSI/AAAAAAAACXY/78AmHtDQfaI/s1600/GetThumb%3Bjsessionid%3D7CFE20FCD399A58D29057EAE47C6D443_2.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S6k7ZiUwoUI/AAAAAAAACXI/tc3Juanj55g/s1600-h/2010-03-21+11.04.55.jpg", "javascript:void(0)", "javascript:void(0)"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/03/what-my-little-eye-spies.html", "title": "\nWhat my Little Eye Spies\n"},

{"date": "14 April, 2010", "body": "\n We just had a great Easter weekend in Tahoe with my sister and her family. So many things went right. Yes, I said so many things went right. \n \n I think that's how travel is for most people. They just pack their bags and get into the car, or get on the plane, then they check in or knock on the door and then they put down their bags and they enjoy their vacation. \n \nI'm not about to complain about going to Tahoe, don't worry. I already now how lucky we are to have a home there filled with supportive and loving family.. who let us stay there for free (or maybe for a case of Two Buck Chuck). It's just that travel is so difficult sometimes that it makes us want to go back home, lock the doors and have groceries delivered. \n \nLucy and I went up on Thursday night, so we would be there in time for me to sing with my sister at the Good Friday Tenebrae service. I think it's the first time I've made it in time to practice and be able to sing with her at church. I love singing with her, so it was very special for me. \n \nLucy and I had such a nice drive. We stopped and ate inside In N Out burger, something she always wants to do and never gets to, since it is often easier for our family to keep driving while I feed kids in the back. She had great table manners and we really enjoyed each other's company. We talked for most of the car ride up. \n \nDescartes brought Jake up after school on Friday, and despite a very big storm, made it in time to put sleepy Jake with the babysitter and still get a chance to go for a drink at a new-ish wine bar. \n \n Saturday we took the kids sledding. Jake didn't last in the sled even to get across the expanse of flat between the car and the hill. The powder was deep, and when he dove off of the sled we were pulling we let him stay there, playing in the snow. I stayed with him for a bit, then Descartes while the other one of us helped Jaster and Demanda with the sledding. Then I heard Descartes holler for me. \n \nJake lost a shoe. Lost a shoe? Lost a shoe. And of course this was the one time we had left the house without an extra pair of shoes for him. His snow boots had already been left at home, home 4 hours away, so we were pushing it with his tennis shoes. And it's not like Jake is going to  tell  us where he lost the shoe. Descartes carried him back to the car so Jake could heat up his frozy toes. \n \n It was fine. Jake and I played in the car while the little kids finished sledding, and because they are little and every hill is a mountain, it wasn't too long before the whole gang was back to the car. \n \nI'm not sure I've mentioned it yet, but we are headed on a cross-country trip this summer. We will be flying to the East coast, where we will meet Oma and Papa and their RV (which they will have driven across the country). I am going to the BlogHer '10 conference in New York that first weekend, then Descartes, and the kids, and the grandparents will pick me up at a train station in a state I've never been to (Pennsylvania?) with the RV with a car in tow. I will be detailing the trip later, but basically we spend a few days with my in-laws then drive the rest of the trip across the country with our little precious children, blisfully taking in National Parks and quiet streams and fabulous diners etc. \n \nExcept I just started to worry a little bit. The shoe thing got me thinking. I know if we forget anything we are probably going to be able to afford to buy it along the way, and there is an entire RV for Jack to hang out in if we lose a shoe, but what else will happen? I'm starting to get little butterflies about the whole thing. Detailed checklists will begin shortly. \n \n \n ***** \nWe will probably be blogging (Descartes is going to go all \"bloggity blog!\") the entire trip, and we will complete some of the same route that Descartes took with his family more than 20 years ago. It should be neat to take photos and take notes of the same places so many years later.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S8YyQjagINI/AAAAAAAACYw/l9zfOcKhzTw/s1600/IMG_0644.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S8YqnV4w2oI/AAAAAAAACYQ/1_S2ApC-ZMc/s1600/IMG_0602.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S8YyHPxAysI/AAAAAAAACYo/bh3PTqVjpFw/s1600/IMG_0598.JPG"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/04/frozy-toes.html", "title": "\nFrozy Toes\n"},

He seems really hungry.\" \n Initial panic, easily put to rest by laughter, because my son goes through phases where he eats everything in sight from 9am-3pm then nothing in the evening, or nothing all day, then has an 18 course dinner. He must be in his day phase. He's fine. He must be going through a growth spurt...again, which means I need to buy 5 more pairs of pants in the next size. \n \n\"No, I mean he's really, really hungry.\" \n Mild panic again: do they think I don't feed him? Does he have a tapeworm? Of course he has a tapeworm, because that is exactly what we need in our family right now is to deal with a tapeworm. \n \n\"He ate half a bag of pretzels.\" \n Phew. Nothing wrong there. Unless they mean one of those Costco-sized bags, but I think they'd be more specific right?

Sh*t. \n \"Mom, who made you frustrated?\" Oh, I am so tempted to call out her father, her precious 'I love my daddy more than I love my mommy' father, because he seriously left me with a car that is not 'a bit low' on gas. The damn car, after moving 15 feet from the driveway, has a little orange light on that is saying: 'Ha Ha!

{"date": "09 May, 2010", "body": "\nI'm still learning how to be a good mother. I'm not sure what I thought being a mom would be like, but I know this life is a lot different than I imagined. and I'll admit that while I'm not much for reading parenting books I do try to learn from the people around me.  \n \n \n **** \nMy mom has shown me that it is extremely important to watch what you do, what you say, and who you are in front of your daughter, because that little girl is always watching, and in spite of all her intentions and the facade of free will, your daughter will grow up to encompass many of your traits, your mannerisms and your values. \n \nMyMomster reminded me gently long ago, when I was dating, to make sure there is a piece of 'me' left for me at the end of it all, advice that put me back on track at just the right time, and something that I try to remember from time to time. \n \nMy mother I borrow from my husband, has shown me what it means to be fiercely loyal, and completely in love with a child; there is nothing she would not do for her children. \n \nI have other mothers around me, amazing women really. \n \nBQ taught me that  the journey  is an important part too, and that in my desire to get  there , I sometimes miss the  here , which is the only place I really need to be. Her endurance and perseverance in mothering continue to amaze me, even all these years later.  \n \nPollyanna reminds me to be spontaneous, and continues to ask me to join in her joy even when I say \"no\" eight times in a row. She might seem like she is always on the fly, but she has a plan for the kind of mom she wants to be, and the opportunities she wants to create for her children. She shapes their world with a gentle hand and without ever raising her voice. \n \nand there's Squid, who is the most consistent mother I know. Her  children are brilliant, and they sparkle with curiosity because she  shows them great things, and talks about great things, and expects great  things from those little people. And when she is done parenting at home  she sets out her door to make the world a better place for all  children. \n \nSage is a baby (and dog) whisperer. Every child adores her because she loves with her whole heart, with a patience I can only admire at this point. I'm still working on actually practicing that one. She comforts and cares with such great depth that she's one of those people I can really cry in front of without feeling weak.  \n \nWhen parenting is not easy, not what I expected or what I want, or I'm feeling like I am just not a capable mom, I always have my sister to lean on or look up to. We have traded children when the ones that call us mom are making us crazy, when we think we cannot possibly feed, bathe and put to bed those shining faces even one more time. She is the one who reminds me of my skills, admonishes me when I am too indulgent, and loves my children like they are her own. She reminds me that loving myself is the first part of being the best mother I can be. \n \nand there are other mothers too, like my neighbor a few doors down, who mothers me, respectfully of course,\u00a0 because her children aren't near her, serving as yet another example that it does not matter whether you are related by blood, or by choice, or by marriage. What matters is how we love, and how we learn from each other. \n \nThank you to all the women who have mothered me, who help me mother my children, and those women who parent their own children so that they can become productive members of our society. I'm not much for Hallmark holidays, but today I raise my glass to each of you.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/05/with-thanks.html", "title": "\nWith Thanks\n"},
{"date": "26 October, 2009", "body": "\nThere was a knock on the door last night, just as I was about to bring Jake in from the back yard and serve him up some dinner. When I opened the door I saw two people who looked vaguely familiar, like I had met them before, even spoken with them, but never been this physically close to them. It was our neighbors-our new neighbors, who I have only really seen over the short fence on our side yard. It's possible I have only ever seen the husband perched on a ladder. They were standing there, smiling at me from the front porch, which is only used by Mormons and the UPS man, staring into my downstairs hallway, which doubles as a dirty laundry chute from the stairway that leads to our kitchen, and the rest of the public spaces upstairs. Upstairs: public space. Downstairs: our den. I don't mean a t.v. and plaid couch sort of den, but a lair sort of den. Some friends of ours have probably never even been downstairs. It's where we sleep and do laundry. We nap and have pillow fights, and watch the fish in the tank, but that's about it for the downstairs. Over a thousand square feet of den, private sanctuary. It is also a disaster with boxes and bags of clothing our children have outgrown and shoes that don't work for anyone in the family, unmade beds and  pillows  askew from those weekend pillow fights. So I quickly I invited them  up stairs, with their sweet plate of cookies (didn't  they  just move in? wasn't that  my  job?) and surprised the heck out of Descartes and thrilled Lucy with our guests. I announced that this was actually all much better that they had stopped by unplanned, because if I had ever waited to feel like my house was clean enough for neighbors...especially new neighbors.. then they would never see the inside of the place. We sat in the living room and chatted while Lucy  annoyed  enchanted everyone with her antics, and Jake played in the back yard. They are a lovely couple, perfectly friendly and nice, and distantly work-associated with a dear friend of ours, so practically vetted as well. They bought the house from a misfit son and his estranged brother, who unequally inherited the house from their recently deceased mother. The house was sold in haste and not well-maintained for at least 20 years, so consequently these new owners have been doing a lot of work fixing their first home. They are outside all the time; in the back, the front, the driveway. They walk their dog. We are not used to young (our age) neighbors. They might want to be friends. They might come over again. I'm not sure why that is such a strange idea for me. I grew up in a neighborhood, with neighbors. Everyone had open doors and kitchens with different types of food being served depending on who the mommy was:  ruglach ,  home made tortillas, or Hostess cupcakes, or seaweed and rice rolls, and everyone had  KoolAid  or Country Time lemonade. My mother walked every day with one or more of her girlfriends, her  neighbors . I think I was in every kitchen or living room on our 28+ house lane save for one. Even crazy Margaret with the 14 poodles invited us in once for candy. The POW and his wife invited us into their garage, which was essentially their living room, for  Popsicles , and it turns out Daniel's dad was not a Russian spy, they were just a family from Russia, so once that got squared away we went their too. Every mom knew who every kid was, and everyone had each other's phone numbers. So what's my deal? Maybe I've gotten used to our privacy? Descartes made us live on a hill, so the houses are all  bit off set, and as I said earlier, our front door is not often used since it is two full flights of stairs from the sidewalk. Maybe this is the last step in being a grown up, as if the mortgage and the life insurance and the two kids and the Desert Sand Mica Not-So-Mini Van were not enough, maybe having neighbors, our age, next door, being all mature and responsible with their yard work and their car washing and their furnishings that match (although I actually don't know this to be true) maybe it just makes me look a bit at our own life, and it makes me a wee bit uncomfortable. I  so  do not have it  together . Not. Even. Close. I think I was just starting to be okay with that.. you know, take small steps towards  together  but not sweat it so much.. and then poof, here they are, those neighbors, with their precious plate of cookies and their kind smiles. Can you believe I'm moaning about nice neighbors? Especially considering we have the not-quite-committing-any-crimes, still-falls-into-the-mischief-category family across the street, using  band saws  at 2am and  helmetlessly  riding mini-bikes up and down the sidewalks. What a whiner I am. The cookies these kind new neighbors brought last night are almost gone, my children saw to that, so I need to go figure out what I am baking to send back to them on their plate. I think that's what a good neighbor would do.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/10/being-neighborly.html", "title": "\nBeing Neighborly\n"},

{"date": "19 May, 2010", "body": "\n We are dealing with some \"stuff\" with Jake right now. It is overwhelming my life emotionally and stealing all of my time and energy. \n I want to talk about it here because I think it could help other families to see the struggles we are going through. Over the years when I have talked about major hurdles, like sleep deprivation or medication or lack of childcare, I have always received emails from people who felt like maybe they were going to be okay after hearing about us figuring something out, or from readers who felt less alone because they were experiencing the same type of grief, or frustration. \n but I also don't want to talk, at all, about any of it, because I have such great shame. \n When you have a special needs kid you begin the race of parenting with one hand tied behind your back, no map of the course, and a delayed start. There are no books which have been able to help me parent my particular child. They have all been too cheesy, or too sad, or too assuming, except perhaps My Baby Rides the Short Bus. \n And our families sure didn't have any training on how to \"deal with this kid who is quirky and walks funny\". The struggles my parents faced with me were more like, \"How do we tame that sass mouth?\" and \"When is she leaving for college?\". And Descartes, it appears, was perfect growing up, never causing trouble or making messes that weren't precious, and  he  certainly didn't sneak out of the house on his 16th birthday and take his new car out for a spin. So as supportive as our family is, they don't really know what to do either. \n Which means we basically make it up, or look ahead on the trail for other families who have done some of this before. We know though, really, that parenting our kids is  our  job, with the support of school and community, but really this stuff is under our purview.\u00a0 And while Descartes is a lovely, involved Daddy, I am mostly the at-home person who is front line, so I feel pretty responsible for the health, welfare and development of both of my kids, and I feel horrible when I can't get it right, and right now I can't get it right. I am not even close.  \n I was raised with three main precepts: \n We will always love you; although we may not always like what you've done, we will always love you. \n \n Jennyalice , you have been taught right from wrong, now judge yourself accordingly. \n \n Well,  Jennyalice , as long as you did your best, whatever the outcome is fine.  You did your absolute best,  didn't you? \n \n And that last one is what gets me every time because I can always, always try harder, do better. ALWAYS. There has not been a moment in my life when I could not have done something better. I could have planned it better. I could have executed better, or faster, or more precisely. I could have been calmer, or more emphatic. I could have been more eloquent, taken on a little bit more, recycled, bought the less expensive one, ridden my bike, called ahead, mapped it out, ironed it, sewed it in a straighter line with stronger thread. I could have cleaned it up right then, or never let it get that way in the first place. I could have thanked someone at the time. I could have apologized, or even better, not antagonized someone into an argument. I could have been patient... I should have been patient, or closed my mouth or thought for just a moment before I ever uttered a word. I should have proofread it all one more time before I turned it in. \n I cannot think of anything that I have done that was my  absolute  best. And most of the time I just live with that gnawing feeling that I am not quite living up to my potential, and I am fine, but when it comes to raising Jake, it is like the wind gets knocked out of me because  I know I have not tried hard enough .  I know. I  know. I know.\u00a0 \n   and I know because I can name things I haven't tried. I have boxes and books and files and charts and half written blog posts of things that have not been tried, or they were tried and abandoned, and this \"stuff\" we are going through with Jake right now, I  know  I could be trying harder. I know there are things I should have done already.\u00a0 I haven't read any of the books I bought on the subject, or taken much of the good advice offered by very close friends. \n I am just so ashamed that I let it all get this far, and sad and I feel like I have failed my son, and you know what else? I'm tired. \n And while I know that we will get through this seemingly increasingly-steep part of the course, I am just so frayed and ragged dealing with the mess, that I'm not sure when I am supposed to get it together to plan out the solution, and even if I do, will I be able to put it all into action, and convince everyone else? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/05/shame.html", "title": "\nShame\n"},
{"date": "10 June, 2010", "body": "\nJake usually has a hard time readjusting to life after anesthesia. I remember getting my tonsils out and crying and fighting with my parents for days afterward, my emotions a raging mess. There's a term for it: post-surgical depression, although the term seems to be used interchangeably whether you are discussing the depression after surgery, or the recovery from anesthesia. I suppose most people under general anesthesia are probably  getting  surgery, so perhaps people don't stop to figure out where the depression really comes from, is it the emotional release after a stressful event, or the medication itself, but back to my point.... Jake has a really hard time. \n \nOnce a year he goes under general so he can have routine dental care. It is not cheap, but it sure is effective, and the dentist and the anesthesiologist are both so wonderful, I can't imagine not going back to them each year. \n \nThe first time we went it was after I saw something red on Jake's tooth. Sadly it was a cracked tooth, half of it missing, and the one on the other side was cracked as well. And of course we have no idea when it happened or how, but we think it may have occurred from coming down hard on his chin and his top teeth banging down on the bottom during some fall he had at the end of that summer. After we found those cracked teeth they were extracted, or at least what was left of them was extracted; He also grinds his teeth terribly. Then we put spacers in, cleaned his teeth and sealed them. \n \nAnother year it meant replacing a spacer which had disappeared (did he swallow it?) and filling a cavity. This year it was simple, remove the spacer (one was gone already...again) and clean his teeth. No cavities, no spacers. His teeth are in great shape. I attribute this genetics mostly, but also to the minor but consistent work we do getting Jake more used to a toothbrush in his mouth (a tooth brush that is actually moving and not just being chewed on) both at school and at home. We also make sure he has water every night before bed, he eats a lot of crunchy, plaque clearing food, like apples, and he doesn't have sugary juices all day long. According to our dentist, it's not the amount of sugar you take in, but the duration that really gets the teeth. Eating a pound of gummy bears in one sitting is less damaging to your teeth than drinking from a sippy cup of juice all afternoon. Thank goodness, because I let him eat a pound of gummy bears just the other day.. kidding. \n \nSo the joy of no tooth problems has been slightly overshadowed now by the aftermath of the anesthesia. He spent all of Thursday, after the dental work in the early morning,\u00a0 being groggy and unstable. You think that kid has ataxia on a regular day, add a touch of Versed to that cerebral palsy and see what happens. I could not be farther than 20 inches from him for most of the day. He was starving on Thursday too, after needing to skip breakfast, and we just never caught up on the calories. It seems like he ate or fell down all day long. More problematic was the \"bad butt\" Jake had Friday and Saturday. It's like his gut just rots, or perhaps we let him eat too much cereal when he begins to wake up, and that's what actually affects his system. Either way it is not pretty for a few days. \n \nThen there is the crying. The crying with tears just kills me. Both of my children can whine and cry and scream and yell, but if they show actual, real, wet, watery tears, 99% of the time it actually means something. It usually means one of them is in severe pain. The most upsetting emotional outbursts are when Jake cries with tears but without an obvious injury. It breaks my heart; he just sobs and sobs, and the tears slip down his face. It sadder than the Native American in that Coca Cola commercial. (How old are you that you know what I am talking about? Ha!)  And  the crying seems to come out of the blue.  And  he can't tell me whether his emotions are just welling up and spilling over because of the anesthesia or if there is a new, sad, unknown-to-mom problem.  \n \n And then  there's the not sleeping. But I'm not really complaining, because this type of not-sleeping does not include yelling (at least not all night) or self-injurious or me-injurious behavior. Last night, Jake's sleeplessness actually came complete with chuckles, snorts and guffaws. \n \nHe was laughing and laughing.. and it was, by this time, about 1:30am. He just would not stop laughing. I had already been downstairs several times, perhaps every 15 minutes or so I had visited his room, and changed his pajamas each time. \n \nWhy? Okay, here's the truth. \n \nJake wasn't just awake and laughing, he was also taking off his pajamas (and diaper) and PEEING everywhere. Well, not everywhere, but in little puddles, next to his bed, in the hall, onto his pajamas. He thought it was hilarious. Each time when I walked him to the bathroom he would laugh even harder and try to go back to bed.  \n \nThis is a big deal and not because I needed to clean up a mess or six, but a big deal in a much more exciting way.  And I'll admit this is where I like to take credit for noticing small victories in the face of adversity , but this little game he's playing means Jake  is  getting closer to toilet training. This peeing on the floor thing is very typical behavioral development for NT kids (at least some (most?) of the ones I've met.) We have a long way to go, but he is learning and using his body in new ways with different awareness. And yes this is part of what I was talking about in that  post about shame , but we are going to get there with good structure and consistency..but hey... Jake can now take down his own pants when he wants to pee! That is a huge accomplishment for a boy who does not have pincer grasp, and has a variable grip. Hooray for new physical abilities! \n \n **** \nHe's down there again this evening wandering between the hall and his room and Lucy's room-- four and a half hours past his bedtime and I know he's awake. He occasionally drops toys over the gate, or more likely a sippy cup because he knows I will bring it back to him, and I can hear his feet slipping across the hardwood. And one of my favorite sounds,\u00a0 his muffled happy squeal as he buries his head in the pillows and blankets.\u00a0  \n \nSo then, back to it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jennyalice.blogspot.com/2010/05/shame.html"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/06/truth-of-matter.html", "title": "\nThe Truth of the Matter\n"},

I think I have more time, but there are more children around, but Lucy has been at camp in the mornings, and at a play date nearly every afternoon, so really there are less, but Jake requires constant monitoring, so I am sort of trapped in the kitchen dining area of my house, or the back yard, so I can't get anything done. Oh, and I feel guilty for not playing with him or taking him any exciting places. \n \nEverything seems to be breaking around here, so I've been running around buying parts, or taking things apart and looking at online schematics, and trying to figure out whether it is better to buy new or fix the old. I was able to fix the washing machine, which made me feel pretty awesome and also pretty annoyed that I spent more than $200 paying someone to fix the exact same problem when it broke last September. The dishwasher is no longer making that terrible noise after I took the entire thing apart and cleaned every tiny part of every tiny part. When someone says \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\" I will now nod my head in absolute agreement. \n \nI have a lot of goals for myself this summer, but I just can't seem to finish anything. Which leads me to one of my first goals of course... I need to let some things go, including giving myself a hard time about everything. \n \nHere are some other things I am going to let go of this summer: \n other emotional baggage \n old cookbooks \n ratty t-shirts, even if I think I should \"keep them for painting\" \n  baby toys, unless Jake really, really likes them \n towels we have taken, almost always by accident, from Super8, the gym, and various hospitals. They are thin and nasty and never ever get soft. \n paperwork that does not matter. Seriously, do I need all of those old phone bills?

If it is this hard for me to accomplish great things here, I can't imagine how much harder it must be for Jake who has difficulty processing.

Lucy will benefit too, she is trying to figure out how to prioritize things in her world, and learning habits which will follow her for a long time.\u00a0 If I can teach her now how to have a place for things, how to make order out of chaos, she will go farther and do more in life than I have. \n \nJake goes to summer school right after the 4th of July holiday, and Lucy has at least two more weeks of camp, so I will have some quiet sorting time when they are off being crazy kids, but it isn't too much longer until we need to prep for our cross-country trip.

I thought, that since I had clearly married the most romantic and kind man in the world that the sparks that flew in the beginning would be only the base for the fire of our life and that the sweet man I chose would never have a mean thing to say. I thought I would always, and in every way find him charming. \n \nI knew we were better together than separate, and that once together we would be unstoppable in our careers, our travels and our desire to have adventure and novelty. Upon meeting us, I was certain I would continue to hear from new friends what an amazing couple we were. \n \nAnd having found such an amazing guy from such a solid family,\u00a0 it never occurred to me that parenting would be anything but joy and pride, with the brilliant little offspring we would create. Our children would be perfect, and well-mannered, and their successes would only bring Descartes and I closer and closer together. Our family would be a vision of success, and happiness. Our parents would be so proud. \n \n \n \n yes, I DO have red hair in these photos \n I thought I would always be a loving and caring wife, who thrilled at pleasing my spouse.\u00a0 I thought I was perfectly suited to being married to this man, and when we smiled at each other throughout  the entire ceremony  I truly thought I would always be that happy. The optimism that surrounded us like a rosy bubble of delight could never be burst, and the people we added to our life would only be more successful and wonderful than we are. \n \n \u00a0******* \n Our life is so very different than I imagined, and yet we are so much better than those people I thought we would be. Our marriage is so much more real, and raw, and I love my husband so much more deeply than I ever thought I would. \n And we  are  much better together than apart; Descartes and I know each other now. After 12 years we really do know each other, but thankfully we are still learning too; what it looks like to truly support someone in their life and career, how to care for each other when we are both in despair. What we have learned is that we travel well, and we're not scared of really anything when we are together.\u00a0 Between the two of us, with his strength and my map reading skills, we can get out of almost anything, or into anything, like this cross-country adventure we are almost done planning. \n We like each other too. Even when we don't get along, we are good roommates, except for the dishes, which apparently no one wants to do, and we continue to negotiate after 14 years of living together.\u00a0 I genuinely like my husband, a lot. I think he's funny and smart, and handsome. And the way he builds things, and knows things is amazing to me. Just this morning, he 'hacked' a camera, breaking in somehow and changing lines of code so it would do what we want it to do-- the only obstacle he faced was our four year old daughter sitting on his head. \n \n \n 1998 \n \n I'm not as 'nice' as I used to be. I don't think I was ever nice actually. I think I've always had a dark sense of humor and a bit of a snarky streak, but I used to have more optimism. I used to track fewer things, so it was easier for me to remember what is actually important. And I'm sure I am not easy to live with because I demand that you read my mind and prioritize life in the exact same way I do.\u00a0 I think I am more demanding, but perhaps that happens to many people as they age and know better what they want from life. Descartes is a patient man, tolerant of my drama, but he's figured out how to bust me out of my perseverations, and move our family on to better things. \n \n \n 2010 \n Parenting has done more to strengthen this marriage than just about anything else. Holding hands during a sonogram while we wait to see if Lucy was growing with all of her parts in the right places, holding each other in a parking lot when we got Jake's first batch of diagnosis from the first official place, helping each other through 52 days of Jake not sleeping, taking turns swinging him or driving, trying to not to yell at each other or our child. Many couples have a few months, maybe a year of disturbed sleep patterns, then they can look back and laugh. We have a life where hard things happen often, but we have learned not to wait to laugh; or at least we try. I think many big, sad things are behind us, and as much as I am rather pragmatic these days, I think I may be coming out of my pessimistic days. Descartes has just been waiting for me, patiently, ever the realist with the ability to take stock, reassess and move on.  \n I know that my life would be different had I chosen someone else to marry, if someone else had chosen me, but I am so glad Descartes and I chose each other, and that we have this life. I know it's not all perfect. But I think our parents are still proud of us, and I'm pretty sure Jake and Lucy will grow up to be decent human beings under our watch, so at least we know we've maintained one small piece of continuity in this world. \n **** I love you my precious husband.\u00a0 Thank you so much for another year of life, this wonderful life with you.\u00a0 xoxo,\u00a0 me \n p.s. please consider this your anniversary card.

{"date": "18 September, 2010", "body": "\n *written Thursday night*  \n \nThere is a mouse in my house. \n \na mouse. \n \nin my house. \n \nand you know what? I am SO GLAD THERE'S a MOUSE IN MY HOUSE, \n \nbecause at least it's not a rat. \n \nokay first of all, before you think I am a loon, there's really only one little mouse and it is very tiny of the field variety. \n \nHere's the thing. I've heard that bugger trying to get into my kitchen for the last week.\u00a0 We have an older house and an empty field, and apparently when they built this house they didn't really make it mouse-proof on the east side. Actually, we  had a problem once before  several years ago, and I sealed up all the holes, took fine mesh and stapled it across all mousie highways, but this one skinny little thing managed to get into the space under the kitchen cabinets and could not find its way out. \n \nSo I knew that that sound, whatever was behind that little wall, that creature couldn't get in to my house because it is sealed to make it into the kitchen. Over the course of the last week, each night, that sound got louder, and in my mind, the mouse grew bigger. It grew to be rat sized, it became a giant rat, then a terrifying oversized rat, and finally tonight, I was quite certain some miniature  chupacabra  was behind the cupboard, stalking my family, walking on the edge of the foundation, scratching the wall. The sound has haunted my sleep, made it hard to work, and occupied my mind nearly all day with me trying to figure out just what to do next to get rid of the giant beast behind the cupboard. \n \nWell, that giant beast eeked its way somehow through the tiniest of openings, and just made a run for it down our hall and into the closet. There's a mouse in my house. a tiny little mouse. \n \nHa HA! It's just a little tiny mouse! Nothing to fear at all. Manageable! Quickly taken care of! \nI set out two glue traps (go ahead, call PETA), and I have a broom next to me as I work, and tomorrow the mouse will be gone, and I will patch up any little holes in our defense system, and it will be taken care of. \n \nand so. \n \nand so that's it. There's no rat in the cupboards. There's no infestation or disaster, and it wasn't chupacabra, or a giant rat, it's a field mouse. \n \nThat's what I do to myself all the time...about everything. I build up a small, easily accomplished task, until it  becomes so big that it occupies most of my active brain power, and I become immobilized\u00a0 by the weight of what I need to do.  \n \nThen things pile up, physically, emotionally. The stack of mail, the unfinished writing, the clothes that the kids have outgrown, looming. And of course, there are all those things \"on my list\" I should do for my children, and for my husband, and maybe even for myself. They are little things mostly, which are reasonable, feasible, and within my range of abilities, like paying the car registration, and emptying Lucy's suitcase from her last little overnight, and taking the pile of shirts in my trunk to the dry cleaner. \n \nIf I could just tackle one, or three, things at a time I can take care of all those mice. And if there are too many, I should be able to ask for someone to help me without feeling like a complete loser. More importantly, I need to remember that a mouse can never turn into a rat (though there may indeed be a few rats that just start out that way.)

{"date": "02 September, 2010", "body": "\nJake is downstairs whooping and hollering, happily. Lucy is asleep in the guest room, having convinced herself that she sleeps better there. Descartes and I have taken up our places on our respective couches, laptops in laps, remote controls within reach. The beer is cold, the night is warm and we are safely snuggled back into our fall routines. \n \nEven though the temperature hit nearly 100F in my backyard this afternoon it could not dissuade me from making home made sugar cookies and some royal icing so Lucy and her girlfriends could cut out shapes and decorate them as part of their afternoon play date. I put a ham in the oven. I contemplated the split pea soup I would make. \n \nJake's birthday is a month away, which means his IEP is in a couple of weeks. Which means sign ups for the amazing respite weekend camp he goes to must be soon. Then there will be Oktoberfest and Halloween, and Thanksgiving and Christmas, and while I will miss the music in the parks, a summer staple in our town, I am looking forward to back-to-school nights, and a new year of the Special Ed PTA, and the calm that will come after the weather cools and the rain comes. \n \nI think I like fall the best. Perhaps it's because I still anticipate a new school year as if it were my own accomplishments that will transpire, and I have always been great at starting school years. It's a sort of rebirth, tabula rasa, the blank notebooks, the sharp pencils, and all those new school clothes. [here's where I would insert a picture of me wearing an Esprit color-block sweater made of scratchy wool with green corduroy pants...a photo from 7th grade when I used nearly all of my back-to-school clothing budget on one outfit because I loved it so very much. My father, a psychologist, let me experience this fully...coming home with only one beautiful esprit bag and a few basics, like socks, underwear and white tennis shoes. Later he felt badly for me and bought me a 3/4 length butter-yellow down coat to add to my wardrobe. It should be noted here that I grew up in Orange County, where the average temperature in the winter months is never lower than about 65. I was able to wear the sweater/cords outfit one time in sunny Orange County, but did wear the set in Germany in October. It never stopped itching me.] \n \nThe kids are happy in their classes. Jake's class is mostly the same, with a few minor staff changes. He fell in love with a new aide to the class, and when I met her the other day I could guess why, with her pleasant demeanor and beautiful smile. Every time I step on the campus at WunderSkool I get a little teary-eyed. The people there are so friendly and they genuinely seem to like their jobs, and their jobs are our kids. Every day I feel like Jake is cared for and learning.We are doing some new things with \"talkers\", and we tried out an iPad last week. He was very interested. Tonight he broke into his sister's room to sneak the iPod Touch from her, or at least see what she was playing. He seems to be more interactive in so many ways lately. He is less frustrated, maybe because he knows we're listening and we believe in him. \n \nLucy was so excited about going in to Room Two that she could barely contain herself on Monday. They call it pre-k, and while there's no algebra yet she does have homework sheets. We're learning together how and when we sit down for school work. When I started to get frustrated with her \"I know Mom. I KNOW.\" attitude I took a deep breath, and remembered to be grateful for  all  of her words even if she was sassy. We'll get there, but she is hard on herself, and I had to talk to her about the difference between finishing first and being (or doing)\u00a0 the best. First is always better in her book, and I can tell she rushes through everything. In the three days she's been there, she has already stopped scribbling everything in, and is paying attention to whether she's supposed to write a lower-case or an upper-case letter. \n \nI am getting back into my groove too. I walked the  Stanfurd dish walk  the other day, which is probably no big whoop for most of y'all, but spending 1:50 minutes in a row without my children, focused on me  and  my health? That hasn't happened in a very long time. We also had a very productive meeting for  The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism . I'm so excited that this project is going so well. We have really collected a great bunch of information from parents and professionals and adults with autism. \n \n ********** post script: it is now 1:18 am.

{"date": "01 October, 2010", "body": "\n \n When my brother Gerard was little, and learning to count, he and my dad would slowly count together. One to five would be drawn out and slow, six and seven even-paced, but right about eight, and certainly after nine, they would make a sudden race for ten, and together they would nearly shout \"Ten! Ten! Ten!\" \n \nand that is just how I am feeling as this day rolls around, and my first child, the boy who made me a mother is ten. Ten. Ten! \n \nIt's cliche to say it all goes by too fast, and in our case I don't think it's always true. Some days, even a year can fly by, but other moments are so weighted with importance, or joy, they seem to be almost outside of space and time. \n \n He went on his first road trip when he was three weeks old, to go to my cousin's wedding. He slept on a wing chair, wrapped up like a little burrito. \n \nHe is getting tall these days, taller than his dad was at that age I think, and though he has puppy feet, nearly too big for his body, his movements are smoother as he gains more control, and more awareness of his limbs.\u00a0   \n \n He ate an entire papaya and chicken  quesadilla  at the Mai Tai bar in Oahu when he was only ten months old. Later that year, the chef came out to see the baby who was eating the wasabi mashed potatoes at the Four Seasons in San Francisco . \n \n \nHe has a great sense of humor ,  and a laugh that is infectious. My favorite is when he giggles so hard that he has to take a big breath. He stands still to let his little sister tickle him, and will come over to the couch for a family tickle match. \n \n The first time he held his own cup and took a drink, we were at an Indian food restaurant and he was more than two years old.\u00a0 \n   \nHe moves so quickly it's hard to believe doctors thought he'd never walk, and he loves to test adults by pretending to meander before he breaks into a full run towards any exit that has been left open.  \n \n He took his first steps across our living room while he was yelling  something at us. We couldn't understand him and he was so frustrated he  got distracted and walked seven steps.\u00a0  \n \n \nHe likes to be outdoors. I think he would be happiest on 40 acres; a place with a grove of shimmering trees, and a small brook with pebbles lining its banks. His love of nature inspired our AdventureVan purchase, and his love of the AdventureVan inspired our cross country journey this summer. He is a road-trip, roadside diner, let's-just-pull-over-here-for-the-night type of kid; his flexibility amazes me. \n \n He went to sleep-away camp for the first time the summer he was five. As we drove away and watched as he ran off smiling and laughing down a leaf strewn hill forcing his counselor to chase him.\u00a0 \n   \nHe's showing an interest in technology, gently touching the screens at  home on devices, and using the mouse at school to get through stories he  likes on the computer. I love the sibling dynamic as he tries to grab  the iPad or iPod from his sister and laughs as she shrieks to keep her  hold. \n \n He got into the car by himself last week, no physical prompts at all, and when we went home he went in through the gate without holding hands, and without running away.  \n \nHe is affectionate, and more and more often he leans in  to show his desire to be near you. His wordless gestures teach me that  my body language, my movements, the spirit I carry through my home is  often more influential than my words. \n \n He got out of bed when I passed by his room tonight. He gently touched my arm before he turned and ran back to his bed. He buried himself in the pillows laughing.  \n \n ******  Happy Birthday sweet boy.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TKV-0dEOiDI/AAAAAAAACrg/OpoXEjhwRHY/s1600/jackonthecouch.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/10/ten-ten-ten.html", "title": "\nTen, Ten, Ten\n"},

{"date": "23 November, 2010", "body": "\nThey were never small, either one of them. My kids have always been on the long/tall side, and while skinny compared to the rest of the family, they are both strong and healthy. They have grown a lot this year, both emotionally and physically. The big trip gave us a nice grounding moment before the school year shook us by its tail, and this week of Thanksgiving will be another touchstone to remind us of how wonderful it is to be a part of our family. \n \nI've been purging the house. It's eight years overdue. We had a lot of things to begin with, then we had Jake and I think I just never got rid of anything that was still useful ever again. I have too many sheets, towels and pillow cases, hundreds and hundreds of books, more shoes than  Imelda . I went through 13 boxes/plastic bins filled with my children's clothing, and more than two bins of their shoes shoes. I sorted them all by size first, then called friends so they could place their orders. One family wanted 2T warm clothes only, and possibly some size 8 shoes. I pulled out the next sizes for my sister's boys, the items that Princess Lucy won't wear because it looks \"too much like boys.\" (She does love camo though!). Then I went through again quickly and picked out things from each bin that had I had little memory of a kid wearing it, or at least I knew I wasn't emotionally attached. This sounds ridiculous even as I write it. Who gets attached to a cheap Hawaiian shirt or a blue dress with apples all over it? \n \nI can remember something about almost every single item in those 16 crates. I can remember that Jake wore the beige sweater with the little red zipper on the Golden Gate bridge. I took a picture of him, and I was so scared his little ataxic body was going to lunge and leap over the four foot barrier and land in front of a car or worse, go over the side of the bridge. The stripey sweater he wore in Montana, the last time we went vacationing with those close family friends before our marriages went in different directions. Jake got caught on the barbed-wire fence at the edge of the property. I made a new land speed record that day rushing over sage and dirt to get to him. By the time I screeched to a halt, he had slipped out of the sweater, calmly pulling his body down and out, leaving a striped scarecrow on the fence.  \n \nLucy came home from the hospital in the pink onsie with snaps up the front, and monkeys printed on it. And the little blue and white dress with the duck embroidered on the front? Cheezy I know, but she\u00a0 wore it on her first visit to feed some ducks at a nearby park. The multi-color sweater with the hood? I bought that the day the ultrasound revealed that Lucy was a girl (and then with the worst kind of buyer's remorse, I worried that I had somehow overstepped a boundary and had invited misfortune into our lives, jinxing everything.)  \n \nI remember buttoning and zipping and folding and maybe even ironing so many of those tiny clothes...but only as I look at them again. I think this is how my brain works: an event occurs, a good thing, a bad thing, any thing, and I remember the event for a very short amount of time. But apparently I really do remember it because it gets stored in a long-term memory section of my brain, only to be released again when I see the sweater, the street sign, the wedding invitation, the pen, the shoes. I use objects as external hard drives. If I don't see the object, I'm afraid all those memories will be gone.\u00a0 Now I know I sound like a crazy person. \n \nThere's another thing happening as I clean out all of these things. I get closer to the corner of the closet with the baby crib. \n \nBaby. Crib. \n \nIt is beautiful. Jake stayed in it until he was too tall and I was afraid he would tip over the rails, and Lucy jumped out the day before her first birthday, prompting a hasty trip to IKEA. We packed up the crib and put it in Jake's closet. \n \nEvery time I open Jake's closet door I have a flood of memories looking at those beautiful wood slats; Jake finally pulling to a stand in his sunny bedroom with yellow walls, when we thought he never would, and Lucy jumping up and down yelling MAMAMAMAMAMAMA to get out of bed. I remember Descartes and I putting that crib together, and arranging the room before Jake was born. \n \nNow getting rid of that crib would hardly remove all of the beautiful memories I have of my children as tiny babies but there is something keeping me from passing it on to the next family. At least I thought there was; I  thought  that our family was not complete without another child.  \n \nThis whole time, I've had this crib in the closet, thinking that we would change our minds and have another baby. Getting pregnant with Lucy was a big decision after Jake, and though we thought we would have three or four children, I've realized (after some long discussions) that I am not really missing having another person in our family, and I cannot actually imagine where or how another child would fit, into my heart, or our home, or our schedule. I just don't have a hollow any more, and I know I used to feel that ache, as if we were not complete--but my heart is full now. And we are whole, and happy and as hard as it feels some days, we are on track.\u00a0  \n \n*** \n \nWhat I am wanting, what I confused with wanting another child, is that idea of fresh and new, and  possibility . It's that whole hope thing again...and while we're at it, I want that fearless part of me back. The woman who was carrying a perfect child and made sure we bought a house near the best elementary school. The woman who read Thoreau, and C.S. Lewis to put that beautiful boy to sleep at night. The woman I was before I broke my leg on the front stairs and had to ask for help,  really, really  ask for help for the first time in my life. I am trying to get some more pieces of that woman back, and somehow I mixed that up with having another baby, because while I do like myself now, I really did like the woman I was then too--she was awesome,  and she knew it. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Imelda_Marcos"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/11/my-tiny-babies.html", "title": "\nMy Tiny Babies\n"},

{"date": "04 February, 2011", "body": "\nI went to Jake's school yesterday for the parent group meeting. I love going on his campus.. it is so filled with great people and interesting kids (and adults).. and friendly office staff. Each time I step on that campus I am reminded how lucky I am to have my son at such a great school, and grateful that he is thriving there. \n \nJake's been having a lot of trouble sleeping lately. I'm not sure if it's growing pains or nightmares or pre-teen angst, but he's been up and out of bed as many as ten times a night. Sometimes I hear his feet patter across the hardwood, other times he whoops and hollers (which his little sister just loooooves.) It doesn't really matter because unless I am really, really sick,\u00a0 I can hear my children through closed doors with the television blaring... I can hear when a blanket has slipped off the bed leaving a little tushie uncovered. Is this a mom thing? or a skill I have picked up because Jake requires such constant monitoring? \n \nLately if I hear him all the way out of bed and coming down the hall I will greet him and lead him back to bed. He usually dives back in, but more recently he's been leaping in to bed, then sitting back up and looking right at me, as if he is asking for me to sit with him, or lay down and sing to him, or pet his hair. \n \nHe has added a new level of relationship to his repertoire, and with these new developments we are experiencing more snuggling, more hand holding, more gentle swishing the hand across a person's back, and, at school, I saw him lean in for a hug from a peer. Not a class aide, because he is generally pretty friendly with his aides.. but another child in his class! Apparently the boys have mutually decided that they are best buds, and the other little boy hugs Jake and speaks to him in sign language, and Jake laughs and reaches out to hold on to him...and there's smiling, so much smiling! \n \nAnd Squid and I had a good laugh because she had heard that her son had become best buds with Jake in another classroom. She was surprised to learn that it was our Jake! Our boys are seeking each other out, standing near each other...hugging? \n \nOur nonverbal, English-as-a-native-language in a predominantly Spanish-speaking school (previously), Jake has still had friends, he even had a girlfriend in first grade (the daughter of a class aide fell madly in love with him!), and everyone seems to know he has a good sense of humor. I'm not surprised really, because as not-nice as I think I am, I have managed to collect a lot of wonderful friends, and I don't think there's a person yet who hasn't liked my smart, kind, always-does-the-right-thing, husband. \n \nI didn't know I had a check-box on my \"Life List for Jake\" that had anything about ensuring he could establish friendships on his own, but of course I did, I think that must be normal, because I know I have it on Lucy's list.

{"date": "12 April, 2011", "body": "\nIn our family, we make medical decisions using science, facts, and data, and we believe in keeping our children healthy, so we vaccinate. I have never thought that vaccines caused my son to be autistic. \n \n \n \n \n \nExcept for that one time. \n \nLucy was a perfect baby, not that she never cried, or blew out a diaper, but she held her perfect little round head up, and rolled over on time, and she just looked. so. perfect. \n \nWhen she was four months old I took her for her routine vaccinations. She was in the 90th percentile for height, the 75th for weight..right on track, and the nurse gave her 3 shots: HIB, Pneumococcal Prevnar 7, and inactivated\u00a0 poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ) She got little round bandages stuck to her little chubby leg. She scrunched up her face to cry and I nursed her a bit, and tucked her back into her little outfit, and put her in her little car seat where she slept for two hours. \n \nWhen she woke up at home I reached in to get her and she began to wail. \"Poor thing, must be starving\"... so I pulled her close and set about to nurse her... and she twisted her head this way and that, thrashed about and screamed. And screamed. And screamed. Every time I tried to comfort her, cradling her in my arm like she was a bouquet of flowers, she just screamed at me. She wouldn't eat. I panicked. \n Oh my God. My child had her shots two hours ago, and now she is a different child. This is how it is, one minute the child is there, then they're gone; that's what I've heard. My daughter has autism. Oh my God. In an instant, every single piece of science went out the window, and anecdote took hold.  My science was my child, \u00a0 my screaming child.  \n \nI called the front desk of the large-ish medical foundation, and put an urgent message in to the doctor I had just seen. I made sure the nurse wrote down \"adverse response to vaccines.\" \n \nThe doctor called me back within 10 minutes, heard the sound of my voice, and Lucy screaming in my arms and told me to rush right back in. The short ride to the doctor's office is only longer when I am carrying my children in utero, and my contractions are three minutes apart. \n \nLucy was calm in her car seat \"bucket\" on the way to the office, but that was no consolation to me. We have spent years driving our son's autism around trying to calm him down enough to sleep. A kid that is quiet in the car doesn't mean anything. When he was younger, we replaced the tires almost as often as we changed the oil and that kid with autism still screamed when the car stopped. \n \nWe were ushered into an exam room, and I left Lucy in her car seat until the doctor came in just a few minutes later. The doctor looked calm, collected and very worried all at the same time. She quietly said, \"Show me  exactly  what's happening.\" \n \nLucy squirmed and whimpered when I pulled her out of her precious floral-patterned bucket. I laid her on my lap then picked her up and brought her close to nurse. She started screaming and thrashing. Her face turned all red. She was not the same baby that the doctor had seen a few hours before. The doctor helped Lucy try to latch on, to no avail. I got tears in my eyes.  \n Oh my God. Oh my God. It's all true: Vaccines cause autism. Jenny McCarthy, Age of Autism, Green the Vaccines, Generation Rescue.. they are all right, somehow, with no scientific evidence, and I just gave my precious baby all of those shots. I broke the baby. I sat there, sniffling and holding my crying child,\u00a0 pulling her closer and closer to me, afraid now that I would drop her and make things even worse. \n \nThe doctor took a step back, sat on the rolling swivel stool that all kids love to play on, and moved herself across the floor towards me again. She very gently took my left hand and moved it slightly. I was still cradling Lucy's head in the crook of my left arm. \n \nLucy turned her head towards my breast and started to nurse. Her body was still a little squirmy, then she calmed down and sucked away, trying to fill her tiny stomach up.  \n \n\"You were pinching her thigh- where she got the shots. You were just holding her leg, and pressing right where she got the shot.\" I started to cry, not a lot,\u00a0 just enough to release all of that terror that had built up.\" I think you are okay now --that she's okay. Call me later if...just call and leave a message and let me know how things go the rest of the day. And come back in if you think it was any thing else.\" \n \n\"You know I'm not a paranoid mom? You know I wouldn't have called, but Jake's autism, and, and, we had the vaccines and, and, I just feel so stupid.\" \n \n\"Don't feel stupid. I knew exactly what you were thinking, and I know you're not a paranoid mom. You're not crazy. It's okay. All of that flashed in my head too; but now we know. So, let's not pinch the baby's leg any more and everything should be fine. Sit awhile and feed her. Take a deep breath.\" And with that, she left the room. \n \nMy baby girl does not have autism. One day, after her vaccines, she screamed a lot when I squished her little leg.  \n \nI can't imagine how I would feel if Jake had been a \"typically developing child\" as some parents of children with autism believe their child was; losing language and the ability to communicate their needs. Jake was different from the beginning, the very, very, first-day beginning; at least I thought he was. So I have never felt like some thing was taken away, or that he was somehow damaged. He has always been a whole, healthy, child whose brain worked differently. But that feeling of thinking you've had something taken away must be such a painful experience for those parents; the parents whose recollections are that their child  did  change overnight, and stayed changed and not because of a little boo-boo on a chubby baby leg. But I know that's just not how it happened with my son and his autism. I'm guessing, in our case, as in many or even most other families, this is a genetic issue which will be brought to light in some number of years down the road. Could there be an environmental insult? Maybe, probably. I'm sure it's complicated. That's why I'm waiting for the data before I go blaming anything. \n \nWhat worries me is that I am a person who  does  believe in science, who has weighed the whole of evidence against the righteous hand of anecdote, and I have settled firmly on the side of scientific proof, not only for the health and welfare of my own children, but for society at large. If I could be swayed in a moment of dismay because of all of the  \"Tabloid Medicine\"  that abounds, what happens with someone who gives the pseudo, or non-science, equal weight? Those people who think that anecdote is somehow equal to a properly done scientific study? If all of that can go running through  my  head pell-mell given my daily practice of relying on data in my decision making, then what happens in those other families? I was so quick to turn to the anecdote and to rumor in that moment, and I'm someone who has access to  good  information. But good information can be harder to find. It's difficult to compete with celebrity endorsers and personal experience. It is a hard sell when all you have are numbers, and black and white pages of scientific jargon. \n \n ***** It's time for us to all turn towards science. I'm not saying we should abandon completely the spiritual, or the intuitive parts of our nature, because I am aware that some things cannot be fully explained by science, and most moms know their kid better than anyone else ever will. Don't throw out everything you have learned through life experience, but, in general, as a rule, why don't we all trust the science just a little bit more, and guess a little bit less. And those of you who do vaccinate, or use medications, or believe in the  scientific method,  let's start talking about it. Let's not keep our mouths shut when people start bragging about how ossicilium cured their cold in \"just 7-10 days\", or that the echinacea they took last year, prevented them from getting the flu last month. \n \nAnd perhaps we should start insisting that the science in the news be reported by someone with even a modicum of understanding of science. If that's all too much, then at the very least, let's all decide, right now, that celebrities will have no part in the decision-making process when it comes to making choices for our health, and our childrens' health.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-u8edhRUw6Iw/TXCAh5bgiVI/AAAAAAAACu8/AtyDBhU2uXw/s1600/katieshead.jpg", "http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1967796-3,00.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/03/interview-with-dr-robert-goldberg-phd.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/04/signs-of-autism.html", "title": "\nSigns of Autism\n"},
{"date": "25 March, 2011", "body": "\nAt the time my son was almost three we realized that without a label, without an official diagnosis, it would be nearly impossible for him to get services from the county or state. It is required so they can check the correct boxes, which allows everyone to take money out of the right vat with the right dipper. It's a pain in the ass, by the way, more difficult than finding childcare or signing your kid up for summer camp. Getting someone, anyone, to write down, definitively, what is  wrong  with your child is a serious lesson in patience, persistence and the power of language.  \n \nNo one wants to be the first person to label your child. We begged to get \"cerebral palsy, ataxia\" to describe Jake's odd way of hipping and hopping and stumbling around. No one worried about anything behavioral at that point, mostly because the check box for MR (which is the nice way of saying mentally retarded) had already been checked. But just a plain old MR won't get you much. It's better to add a little HI (hearing impairment), or better yet there's number 5 which is vision impairment. We don't have checks in those boxes, but we do have most of the other ones; developmental delay, speech/language impairment, multiple disabilities. Truthfully the best one I've found so far is OI, orthopedic impairment. If you get  that  box checked, the money comes out of some other pocket called the \" low incidence fund \", and people stop caring how much your child's little switches and talking buttons cost because the school district doesn't pay for them directly, it comes out at a different level in the budget. When we started this game with his first IEP in 2003, the box for Autism wasn't even on the paper. \n \nWhen Jake did\u00a0 receive the autism label, a year later, written down on the letterhead from the pediatric psychiatry department from a prestigious university, I called the office back to make sure that they knew they had put my son in the \"autism\" category of the study. The poor PI stuttered a bit and asked if anyone had ever talked to me about the fact that my son was autistic. I jumped in and said, \"Oh, don't worry, we're thrilled!\" She let me know that I was the first person she had ever spoken to that had used the word \"thrilled\" after an autism diagnosis. \n \nBut I really was, because there is a power in naming things. We can box it up emotionally. We can explain it. Do you know how much easier it is for my son's grandparents to say that their grandson has \"autism\"? The first three years were spent mumbling a lot of, well he's \"behind a little\" and he has \"low tone\", well, actually he's \"behind a lot\", and he \"isn't talking\", but he has a \"great appetite\", and he's such a \"beautiful boy\" blah blah. Thank God we got that one little word. \n \nI get why labels could be a bad thing, how they might hold you back, or allow other people to peg emotions or expectations on you based on what you've been called; bright, disappointment, overachiever, does-not-apply-herself, genius, chattycathy, princess, precious, trouble, smart ass, smart mouth, back-talking, ungrateful, messy, funny, beautiful, too-big-for-her-britches, too big to wear that, too smart to do that, responsible, mature for her age, growing up too fast, capable, little girl who can do anything she wants if she just tries hard enough. \n \nI've been labeled since I was born. I am the first born. That was probably my first designation, then, the \"oldest\", but like most labels, it doesn't quite fit anymore. I have older step-sisters now, and older sisters-in-law, and in my group of friends I am variably the youngest, or the middlest, but very rarely the oldest. \n \nTowards the end of high school, and through my first years away at university, my parents, the side that has not one, but two psychologists, had a chart on the pantry door. It was a barometer of sorts with each of the four children's names able to move up and down depending on where we were currently \"being appreciated\" in the family. At the top were words like \"genius\" and \"precious\" and perhaps \"our pride and joy.\" Then there were probably words like \"good job\", and \"still gets a key to the house.\" Towards the bottom were phrases like, \"willing to sell to highest bidder\", and \"a curse upon our house\" and other terrible things you should never say about your children, or the family pets, who also, somehow had their names on the door as well. It was very distressing when the rabbit who pooped in the living room was higher up on that chart than my name. \n \nI'm not sure how we got moved around. There were points involved, sort of, but once when I asked how many points there were in total (so as to determine whether losing 1000 points was worth it to do what I wanted to do), there was no definitive answer, so I know that wasn't all of it. The kids, we moved each other's names around a lot. My sister, Demanda, was almost always \"precious\" given her proclivity to near-death experiences, and grave illness. Though to be honest, she still gets \"precious\" most of the time. Looking back at some of my actions during college, I'm surprised I got to stay on the chart at all. My younger brother was generally a good kid, except for the Christmas when he asked for all of the receipts, so he could exchange the gifts we got him for something he \"actually wanted.\" I don't think \"wienie\" was on the chart, but it would have fit. \"Genius\" was a good label to have, at least in my book, and my youngest brother and I have fought over that one for years. (My parents think it's funny to tell each of us that they know our IQs but won't share them with us. I think they tell each of us, privately, that ours is the highest, so we can feel superior to our siblings, and they can have something to giggle about.) \n \nWhen I talk about \"the chart\" now, as an adult, most people look a little bit horrified. And I suppose that labeling us, constantly, was perhaps a little bit mean?, but also so honest and encouraging. I am capable. I can do anything I set my mind to do. After all these years, I think that's my label. So I suppose I'm a bit of a superhero. I can do  anything . Is that such a bad thing? \n \nI always knew exactly where I stood in my family. I know I was loved, by all of my parents; no matter what they called me, I have always felt loved. And there is that whole \"power in naming things\", or at least calling us out for our deeds, good or bad. If everyone, at the same time, knew that my parents were disappointed in me, maybe that helped one of my younger siblings avoid whatever quagmire I had slogged through. And being praised by your parents, in view of your siblings? Well, that felt great, but it never lasted long, because it would only be a few minutes before your name would slide down and the damn rabbit would hop to the top. I think we each tried hard to be towards the top of that chart, not  because it would earn us more love, but because that's one of the ways  our parents pushed us, in school and in life, and in relationships. Those labels were worth aiming for. \n \nI understand when a label can stop you from growing, or allow someone to have a lower expectation of you. When someone called my son \"mentally retarded\" instead of \"developmentally delayed\",\u00a0 I had a visceral response, because, to me, one label is finite, and the other holds optimism. But I know it is ridiculous for me to let those few words hold so much power over my emotions.  \n \nLabels help us identify each other, and if we are smart, we recognize that labels are really only for the person who is using them, so they can know how to interact with us. I can't really change what label someone puts on me, or my son, I can only change my behavior. It really shouldn't matter at all what words  someone else needs  to describe me or my kid. What will always be most important is that he gets what he needs, and whatever box we need to check, we will.  \n \nBut you know he'll always get what he needs, right? Because I'm his mom, and  I can do anything, as long as I set my mind to it-- at least that's what my parents told me. \n \n \n ***** A version of this post was featured in the  Life section of Salon.com \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/fo/profile.asp?id=861", "http://www.salon.com/news/autism/index.html?story=/mwt/feature/2011/03/31/labeling_my_autistic_son_open2011"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/03/label-me-capable.html", "title": "\nLabel Me Capable\n"},
{"date": "08 May, 2011", "body": "\nI actually never thought mothering would be easy. I thought I would have a hard time getting pregnant (I didn't), and when I was pregnant, I worried a lot about having a child with special needs (I did). \n \nI knew, from having been a precocious child (that's precocious, not precious!) that children could have smart-mouths and not sleep well. And from my teenage years, I recognized that children turn into young adults sooner than you think and might even sneak out of their parents' home, spend their 17th birthday across the border, and they might even water-down the creme de menthe in the liquor cabinet without their parents even knowing. \n \nBut I did think, for example, that my children would listen to me, and actually do something very, very close to what I asked, within a time frame that looked like they were following my directions. As much as I talked back and asked why, I am fairly certain that I did follow instructions, or at least I went to my room to be grounded. I thought there would be a lot more museums and going to the opera, and learning needlepoint, more library visits, trips to the beach and fishing, and I find myself pausing, in the face of things I don't like, or are hard, or not fun, and I ponder if I am being a good enough mom.  \n \"If you are wondering if you are a good mom, you are, because bad moms never wonder.\"\u00a0  That's my line to other moms. To my sister, to my friends, to strangers. I can say that to lots of other women, and comfort them when they feel like they are faltering, I know what good parenting looks like, and even when we make mistakes, it's mostly the trying hard that counts in parenting.  \n \nBut it's harder than I thought it would be; much harder, and I can't always be settled with my own advice. I feel like I have  not met their needs on most days, that I have been selfish. I lie awake thinking I  didn't try hard enough, or that I used an unkind voice when I could have  taken a breath.\u00a0 And I worry that my chances to \"make up\" are slipping away; Lucy will be five in a month and Jake is ten and half.  \n \nWhat I did not expect, what you can't see from the outside, is the gnawing inside that I would  never, ever feel like I had done enough for my children. Is that what being a mother is? To have those thoughts of each child's temperature and stomach content and to constantly be discerning the cleanliness level of both their teeth and clothing. I am concerned about the radio, television, books and words that are on display in my home and in my car. I worry about how they are treating their friends, and which children are they befriending? And how are they communicating with others when I am not around to intuit their every need? Every choice I make considers their very existence. \n \nIt seems so much easier for other moms. They naturally make plans for spring break that include the science museum and a trip to the beach. They stop by the library on their way home from dance class. They enroll their children in violin lessons, piano lessons, and drum circles, and plan sleepover parties for six.\u00a0 Maybe I make it harder on myself because I have such amazing friends, and every thing each of them do, seems so fantastic that I want to do all of those things, even if those activities are coming from three or four or five moms, and not just one. It may be unrealistic, but not undesirable. \n \nI would love to have a day when I knew that I had done my best, and that was the best that could be done.  \n \n *****  \nThere are some other things that are so much easier than I imagined, so much better, warmer, brighter, meaningful and important. I hesitate to call them out because I don't want to mock them, or make light of their gravity, but they are mostly the things I never knew about at all before I became their mother. \n \nMissing my first-born when an emergency surgery kept me from him when he was only 30 days old. The ache I felt in that hospital room without him was the most unbearable pain I could ever imagine, no wound or slice, or broken bone can compare to that hollow that could only be filled by that tiny boy. And the wholeness and lightness I felt when I held him again was like no other joy I had ever had. \n \nMy daughter asks me to sing her to sleep so she can 'hear me in her dreams' and holds my hand in the car while I am driving so we can be close before she leaves me for the day. My son has friends at school, and has developed meaningful relationships all on his own using his great sense of humor and his joi de vivre. \n \nI never could have guessed how wonderful it would be to sleep next to my babies, or how watching them sleep could make me weep \n \n...and I didn't know how easy it would be to fall in love, so deeply, so permanently, and so completely. \n \nThank you to my husband and my children for helping to shape so much of who I am. And to all of the women who support me, pave the way, comfort me and praise me, I am forever grateful. \n \n ****  This post was an editor's pick today at  OpenSalon.com \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://open.salon.com/blog/jennyalice/2011/05/08/mothering_its_never_as_easy_as_it_looks"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/05/mothering-its-never-as-easy-as-it-looks.html", "title": "\nMothering: It's Never as Easy as It Looks\n"},
{"date": "01 November, 2010", "body": "\nI don't really like Halloween. I'm not sure when I started not to like it. Maybe it was the pressure of coming up with a great costume; jeesh, I had the kind of friends who dressed up as green m&ms and other cool things.  \n \nMaybe it's that I was raised to think that I was\u00a0 destined to be hit by a car while trick-or-treating, or that by the time I got to college, it was expected that all females would dress as some sort of sexy version of normal things: sexy vampire, sexy nurse, sexy meter maid, sexy butcher, sexy Cal-trans worker...although I did the Castro thing in the late 90s, and I had fun (and yes I went as a sexy cowgirl).  \n \nand now I'm a mom, and so I do Halloween. I am anxious about it every year, that my kids won't have the right costume, that they will look back and think I didn't do enough.. it will somehow be obvious that I can't wait for October to fly by.  \n \n \n \n scary girls, scary babies \n \n But enough of all that... we DID do Halloween this year, and not only that, but it went well from costumes to school parties to trick-or-treating. \n \nWe went to the Halloween store a few weeks ago in the search of a costume for Jake.\u00a0 We've done several years of those muscle costumes where the fabric is stuffed with filler to make the kid look big and manly. So far, he's been the Hulk, and Superman and Mr. Incredible, and Spiderman and I can't remember what else. They are great, easy costumes (which end up in the dress-up box later!), but we couldn't find one we liked. \n \nWe found a lot of scary things that someone, not us, might set up around a house, but the costume selection was not all that great for tween boys unless you want to wear a mask. We didn't find anything reasonable that night, although my daughter very sweetly let me know that I my legs would look great in this costume: \n \n \n I love that my daughter thinks I look like this \n \n We carved pumpkins with Descartes' parents last Sunday, which was fun, and made me remember that I carved pumpkins with them the first year I knew them in 1995. This year the carved pumpkins didn't last until Halloween. We enjoyed, okay, I enjoyed, watching Hello Kitty slowly melt and be consumed by mold. It was less fun to clean it up, but I have a wonderful husband who took care of that. \n \nWe finally found costumes for both kids. Lucy went as Belle, and Jake went as a cowboy. Picking out Jake's costume was really very fun. Descartes, Lucy and I each picked one or two costumes we thought would work for Jake, then presented them all to him. He laughed and laughed, especially when we each tried to convince him to choose the costume we were holding. We got it down to three, then two, and he finally picked the cowboy outfit. \n \n \nBoth children had school parties/parades... Lucy first... my galliwompus little Belle, who could barely hold still long enough for me to brush her hair. She actually said that her head was going to pop off because she was so excited about Halloween. For trick-or-treating on Sunday night she had to put on a long sleeve tshirt under her dress. I love how Northern California kids just suck it up and wear jackets or layer to keep warm. There's no complaining like we did when I grew up...oh, all that moaning I did about how the shirt or jacket was going to ruin my costume.  \n \nThe best story of Halloween may be as simple as a hat. Jake wore a hat. JAKE WORE A HAT! \n \n He apparently wore his hat almost all day at school on Friday. Certainly he wore it the entire time Lucy and I were with him when he went from classroom to classroom collecting candy. He also wore it on Sunday trick-or-treating. This is so huge. He's also been wearing his helmet when he rides his bike at school, and all this after he wore a helmet horseback riding this summer. \n \nI know he's getting older, that he's learning every day, gaining new skills, but I think I have just let go of some things. When we realized that Jake hated hats (and gloves) we knew that  we were not going to move to any place less temperate,  and I sort of stopped worrying about it, and stopped thinking about it last winter. It is exciting to be able to check that box off. We still have a long way to go before he's wearing a baseball hat to keep off the sun, or a knit cap to keep warm, but I'll take several hours of an ill-fitting cowboy hat. It's a start, and we like starts because that means at least we are on the same road. \n \n \n \n yes, Gus has a costume on. \n \n \n awake and happy the entire time! \n Sunday night we went through the neighborhood with a couple of other families. Jake went in his wheelchair, for safety, our peace of mind, and the fact that he normally goes to bed around the time most kids start trick-or-treating, so we expected him to get tired. Lucy was very precious, as she asked for another piece of candy for her brother, if we couldn't easily wheel the chair to the door. Later, she just took half of whatever she had been given and put it into his bag rather than ask for more. She gets extra points for that because that girl loves candy like no one I have ever seen.  \n \nEveryone made it through the trick-or-treating..no tears, no  complaining, no melt-downs...we have bags and bags of candy, and no sick  stomachs. Both kids are sleeping now, (although Lucy is next to me on  the couch) and I am a grateful woman who just might like Halloween a little bit more this year.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://twitpic.com/show/thumb/2xxgts.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TM5Ij79yCjI/AAAAAAAACr4/SuXoyWjTqVo/s1600/robin.jpg", "http://twitpic.com/30lk79", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TM5pCQnCdEI/AAAAAAAACr8/5akbWyiwaEw/s1600/IMG_20101029_084926.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TM5pM8C9CiI/AAAAAAAACsE/S81gzul0i7M/s1600/IMG_20101029_134643.jpg", "http://www.blogher.com/winterproofing-kids-who-dont-get-cold", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TM5pV8haGRI/AAAAAAAACsM/oizQbxfPtj8/s1600/IMG_20101031_173606_2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TM5pRC9vaLI/AAAAAAAACsI/36pmzzvNVdc/s1600/IMG_20101031_173606.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/11/hat-makes-man.html", "title": "\nThe Hat Makes the Man\n"},
{"date": "23 June, 2011", "body": "\n I haven't swept the floor all week. Not once. It is unimaginable that my kitchen floor could go six hours without needing to be swept, and it has been nearly five days. I am giddy that my feet are free of crumbs, pebbles and warm black dirt from our backyard.\u00a0 \n Sweeping is one of those things that I do not put into the category of \"things that make our family different from other families.\" \"Carries wheelchair in vehicle at all times\" and \"must have a straw or sippy cup available for my 10 year old\" are in that category, but sweeping? How many times each day does a family with a ten year old boy sweep the kitchen floor? At our house the number is nearly uncountable. \n Jake has been at camp this week. He's likely living it up right now at a dance or talent show, followed by some happy snuggling into his bunk. He's spent days surrounded by singing and crafts and pool noodles and fun. When he comes home, he'll grubby and covered in sunscreen and his laundry will need to go through both pre-wash and second rinse. And by this time tomorrow, these bare tiles will only be a memory. \n Because Jake spills cereal, fruit and crackers. He drops his sippy-cup onto the floor creating little speckles of milk that spray across the hardwood, inviting dirt he has tracked in, to cling and accumulate. He takes at least a pinch of soil out of the kitchen garden planter on the porch, and brings it inside with him every time he enters the back door, and he dribbles pebbles and tan bark from his hands, his shoes and his pockets. He has fine layers of grit on him because he sifts rocks from dirt with the patience and endurance of an archaeologist on the verge of a great find. He gets dirty every day. \n So as much as I love the feel of treading across cool ceramic tile, it also reminds me that Jake isn't home. And as much as I know he loves camp, I will be thrilled to kiss the top of his little puppy-in-the-rain smelling head.\u00a0 \n And while the reprieve from sweeping has been lovely, it will be wonderful to have myBoy and his sand-filled shoes home.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/06/i-havent-swept-floor-all-week.html", "title": "\nLove and a Dustpan\n"},
{"date": "01 July, 2011", "body": "\nI think Jake might need to go back on a medication to help him concentrate at school, and be able to sit down for dinner, which he can no longer do unless he is in his wheelchair. He stopped taking the previous meds in the fall, after several weeks of behavior that did not dictate further use of the medication, but before the next round of school I think he should be evaluated... so I put in a request with his psychiatrist at the medical foundation we visit; a place about which I usually have lots of good things to say. \n \nIn response to my request for a morning appointment any time between now and the end of ages, I got an email back, saying that since it had been over a year we needed to contact the Intake Coordinator via the website or by phone. The visit to their website didn't take me any further in the process.  \n \nSo I called them, and was told that we need to do a \"patient intake.\" \n \nFantastic! She asked for all of our insurance information, and verified our billing address, and my husband's ID numbers. And I got to hear about how the doctor we've seen for five years is going to be an out-of-pocket expense, and of course I know that because it is very expensive to go to an out-of-network doctor; but he is worth it. This guy knows his stuff, and more importantly he knows my kid. \n \nBut wait!\u00a0 As it turns out, Jake's 'regular' doctor is no longer accepting 'new patients' because  we are now considered a new patient.  I can call back in three weeks and see if he has opened his practice to 'new patients', and continue the intake process. Even though we have seen this doctor six or seven times in the last five years (more than he's seen his dentist or his neurologist), we get to start over. \n \nOh, and because we are a new patient we get to pay over $500 for a 1-1 1/2 hour parent/child visit, then several hundred more for a 45 minute patient only visit... good luck with that one. And as a reminder, I may not leave a child under the age of 13 unsupervised in the waiting room. Acknowledged. \n \nAnd, this was just the first phone call before I can even schedule that appointment. Next comes the call from the other half of intake coordination... asking all of the medical history part, except it might be a short call since he's been seen here already. Well that's nice.  \n \nSo are we a new patient? A kind of medium-old patient? We're like a 'restored' patient maybe? We saw the doctor 20 months ago. If I had made an appointment 8 months ago.. just to \"check in\", even though we didn't really need to,\u00a0 it would have cost us $150, and we could just make another appointment with him now for another $150.  \n \nThis is not about the money for me really though. I am just sad and  frustrated, because dammit this life is hard enough already.... why else  would I be calling them? At what point in this process are they taking care of the mental health of my child (or me for that matter?) How many phone calls before I can schedule an appointment? How many hoops? \n \nBut let this be a public service announcement: If you want to keep seeing your very-important-to-your-health doctor  when you need to , ask what their policy is on how often you must be seen to remain an active client. If the doctor has a wait list, chances are they have some awesome policy like this one. Let me tell you how much I wish I had just sent them $150 bucks last year. \n \nOkay then. I cannot take care of this any more today or my head will pop  off. I already said the f-word in a conversation with my parents, so  that tells ya where I am with it all. \n \nand now I will return to my regularly scheduled packing for a wonderful weekend in Tahoe. We will be adding brandy to the sangria tonight. Have a lovely weekend friends. \n \n \n *********  an update: the office staff called me Friday afternoon late and we decided she would contact the doctor to get an exception. The phone call I received this morning 7/5 confirmed that the the practice is still closed and I can try in three weeks to see if there is an opening, or start over with the other doctor (who is also out of network... no thanks.) \n I am not going to fight this one because I can't have a doctor/patient relationship with a provider who shows this kind of disregard; my son's appointments take approximately 35 minutes once a year. We pay $150 for this privilege. It's time to start looking for a new doctor.  \n I will not slander the medical abilities of this doctor because he has been extremely helpful in the past, however I will not be recommending him in the future.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/07/venting-frustration-mental-health.html", "title": "\nVenting Frustration: Mental Health\n"},
{"date": "14 July, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n arbitrary \n \nI took both of my children to the park the other day. It shouldn't be some sort of big announcement that a mom takes her kids to the park, but  I was by myself with my two children , who have  very  different, needs, wants, and abilities, and I am a chicken. There. I said it. I am a scaredy-cat when it comes to taking my kids out into open, uncontrolled situations by myself, unless Jake is buckled into his wheelchair. He has escaped my grasp so many times, wrenching my shoulder as he goes; and he is fast. And as mature and amazing Lucy is at 5, she really is still a small child who deserves to be looked after on a busy street, or a park... but it is summer, and my children are convincing, so I took them. \n \n \n \n Lucy providing high direction, high support \n \nLucy was very excited about playing in the cool water fountains that are shaped like Crayons. She got to learn the word \"arbitrary\" when I remembered that the park and rec department turns off the sprinkler fountains between 12pm and 1pm, and again from 3pm to 4pm. Because, apparently we cannot decide for ourselves when our children should have lunch, and a snack. It worked out fine because she got to play in the water puddle that had already been created, and managed to put together an engineering plan to create a dam that rivals the Hoover. She had no problem hiring the one of the unnamed boys near her to hold 'on' the foot sprayer nozzles to collect water, and the other to bring the bucket to her building site. She seemed like a decent  overlord  boss. \n \n \n \n Meandering with Purpose \n \nThen there was Jake. Precious boy who I forgot to put in bright orange before we left the house; I am rather particular about this. When he goes on a field trip, to  camp , into the woods, into a crowd, okay, when he goes almost anywhere I put him in yellow, but more often, orange, actually, bright orange. He has his own hunter-safety-orange cozy jacket for camping trips. The afternoon we \"lost\" him in dappled sunlight when he was only 6 feet away from us was the last time I let him get near any vegetation without an easy way to spot him. \n \n \n Can you see him? Yeah, Neither can I. \n \n \nSo of course the first thing he does is head for the only corner of the top portion of this park where I would not be able to see him. I didn't worry a bit because the chain link fence runs the entire way around the park. But wait, I couldn't actually see that corner post, and what if the fence were made by  two brothers who got in a fight half way  through the project and so there are really two corner posts, and a gap between them which leads STRAIGHT OUT TO THE STREET. I was only about 40 feet from him, but if that corner was open, which I knew it wasn't,  but if it was , he was only 20 feet from cars pretending to drive 30 miles per hour. \n \n \n \n myBoy in urban camo \n \nI ran. I ran as fast as I could, and I lost a shoe on the way because I am an idiot and had thought, \"Oh I can just wear my sandals because I am going to sit and watch my children play, and I will put my toes in the warm sand.\" I ran across the tan bark that my son loves so much with one open-toed sandal and one bare foot, and there he was, in the corner, where the fence was perfectly closed and built to code etc. I tried to give him some space, but it was very hard for me to not be able to see him, even if I knew there was no way out except past me.. because maybe today was going to be the day when he gains that fence climbing skill? We just never know. And if you are wondering if he laughed a little bit when he saw me plucking tan bark out of my sandal, the answer is, \"yes.\" I let him play in the corner until he was done, and it may be my imagination, but as soon as I stopped being riled up about it he stopped going back there. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ooooh so close to escape. \n \nOur visit to this little neighborhood playground, it wasn't all bad, or scary. On the busy street I had to parallel park between two cars that were over their little hash lines into my space, but we did get the safest spot, right next to the path that leads to the park. And every single family that went through the gate on that path, closed it behind them. The weather was beautiful, and Lucy was a good listener the entire time, which was pretty remarkable all by itself. When it was time to go, she left the park without complaint or stomping of the feet. \n \nAnd while we were there, Jake got to work on those motor skills that are so important. He practiced \"jumping off\", which is different than \"walking off\", of something. I got to practice letting my son be outside of my grasp, which feels a lot like being \"thrown off\" of something. I did put my toes in the sand for a moment, and the kids had a great time playing.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere will be a day when my children don't want to go to the park, not like this at least. An afternoon will come that my daughter doesn't ask me, even one time, to play with her. It's possible that Jake will live somewhere without me when he's older. I want my kids to remember playing and running around. I want the smell of sunblock to remind them of all those days of being in the sunshine in our beautiful park-filled city. I'm trying to remember that these are the days when we should paint, or make lemonade.. or do as Lucy has asked and have a lemonade stand with a painted sign. \n \nAnd I am trying to get over my fears that by myself, out there, in a park, or on a walk downtown, that I won't be able to keep both of my children safe. I know I am perfectly capable, but there are so many ways things can go wrong, and I've thought of them all. My brain hurts quite often with all the \" choose your own adventure \" stories in my head. However, I'm aware that emotion does not make fact, nor does a lively imagination, so the truth of it is, that most of the time, everything goes just fine. Everything will be okay, or it won't, but fear has very rarely led to anything good in this world, and it certainly has kept me from some beautiful days in the park. \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0 ***** \n \n a version of this post was an editor's pick today at  OpenSalon.com   \n \n \nvar gtbTranslateOnElementLoaded;(function(){var lib = null;var checkReadyCount = 0;function sendMessage(message, attrs) {  var data = document.getElementById(\"gtbTranslateElementCode\");  for (var p in attrs) {    data.removeAttribute(p);  }  for (var p in attrs) {    if (\"undefined\" != typeof attrs[p]) {      data.setAttribute(p, attrs[p]);    }  }  var evt = document.createEvent(\"Events\");  evt.initEvent(message, true, false);  document.dispatchEvent(evt);}function checkLibReady (){  var ready = lib.isAvailable();  if (ready) {    sendMessage(\"gtbTranslateLibReady\", {\"gtbTranslateError\" : false});    return;  }  if (checkReadyCount++ > 5) {    sendMessage(\"gtbTranslateLibReady\", {\"gtbTranslateError\" : true});    return;  }  setTimeout(checkLibReady, 100);}gtbTranslateOnElementLoaded = function () {  lib = google.translate.TranslateService({});  sendMessage(\"{EVT_LOADED}\", {}, []);  var data = document.getElementById(\"gtbTranslateElementCode\");  data.addEventListener(\"gtbTranslate\", onTranslateRequest, true);  data.addEventListener(\"gtbTranslateCheckReady\", onCheckReady, true);  data.addEventListener(\"gtbTranslateRevert\", onRevert, true);  checkLibReady();};function onCheckReady() {  var ready = lib.isAvailable();  sendMessage(\"gtbTranslateLibReady\", {\"gtbTranslateError\" : !ready});}function onTranslateRequest() {  var data = document.getElementById(\"gtbTranslateElementCode\");  var orig = data.getAttribute(\"gtbOriginalLang\");  var target = data.getAttribute(\"gtbTargetLang\");  lib.translatePage(orig, target, onProgress);}function onProgress(progress, opt_finished, opt_error) {  sendMessage(\"gtbTranslateOnProgress\", {\"gtbTranslateProgress\" : progress,       \"gtbTranslateFinished\" : opt_finished, \"gtbTranslateError\" : opt_error});}function onRevert() {  lib.restore();}})(); (function(){var d=window,e=document;function f(b){var a=e.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0];a||(a=e.body.parentNode.appendChild(e.createElement(\"head\")));a.appendChild(b)}function _loadJs(b){var a=e.createElement(\"script\");a.type=\"text/javascript\";a.charset=\"UTF-8\";a.src=b;f(a)}function _loadCss(b){var a=e.createElement(\"link\");a.type=\"text/css\";a.rel=\"stylesheet\";a.charset=\"UTF-8\";a.href=b;f(a)}function _isNS(b){for(var b=b.split(\".\"),a=d,c=0;c<b.length;++c)if(!(a=a[b[c]]))return!1;return!0}\nfunction _setupNS(b){for(var b=b.split(\".\"),a=d,c=0;c<b.length;++c)a=a[b[c]]||(a[b[c]]={});return a}d.addEventListener&&typeof e.readyState==\"undefined\"&&d.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\",function(){e.readyState=\"complete\"},!1);\nif (_isNS('google.translate.Element')){return}var c=_setupNS('google.translate._const');c._cl='en';c._cuc='gtbTranslateOnElementLoaded';c._cac='';c._cam='lib';var h='translate.googleapis.com';var b=(window.location.protocol=='https:'?'https://':'http://')+h;c._pah=h;c._pbi=b+'/translate_static/img/te_bk.gif';c._pci=b+'/translate_static/img/te_ctrl3.gif';c._phf=h+'/translate_static/js/element/hrs.swf';c._pli=b+'/translate_static/img/loading.gif';c._plla=h+'/translate_a/l';c._pmi=b+'/translate_static/img/mini_google.png';c._ps=b+'/translate_static/css/translateelement.css';c._puh='translate.google.com';_loadCss(c._ps);_loadJs(b+'/translate_static/js/element/main.js');})();\n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CgKs7cctgYQ/ThzRodE6xII/AAAAAAAAC4o/GN-GHFAWrpQ/s1600/2011-07-12_15-57-37_248.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_ZsxG6xobNM/ThzPnH_MZDI/AAAAAAAAC4Q/ta4DtlV3jqI/s1600/2011-07-12_15-45-51_325.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7QMJSPmpBw8/ThzPOsKnhKI/AAAAAAAAC4I/62zxALlZZk4/s1600/2011-07-12_15-46-54_903.jpg", "http://www.viaservices.org/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NZHGGgItDqY/ThzPLxY-c8I/AAAAAAAAC4E/-tGxURwqBwY/s1600/2011-07-12_15-47-18_679.jpg", "http://archive.dailycal.org/article/18831/news_in_brief", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wmqLF4wOEy4/ThzOFmDzKSI/AAAAAAAAC30/npuSpeUWi-M/s1600/2011-07-12_15-42-18_520.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UiVuND1KGhU/ThzOjw_MFPI/AAAAAAAAC34/4ONR-ISsxRM/s1600/2011-07-12_15-43-50_684.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YvCL_oFle_0/ThzQS-KVzGI/AAAAAAAAC4g/sBKKUDRpTag/s1600/2011-07-12_15-51-26_359.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_your_own_adventure", "http://open.salon.com/blog/jennyalice/2011/07/14/parenting_in_the_park"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/07/parenting-in-park.html", "title": "\nParenting in the Park\n"},
{"date": "18 October, 2011", "body": "\nI'm responsible, capable and able to make good decisions in a crisis, but I am not a very 'calm' person by nature, so yoga, with it's years of practice to become a master, and it's zen-like relaxation... the silence and the named poses, none of it seems like it would be a good fit for me. But I've tried. \n \nThe first time I went to yoga was with my dear friend BQ. It was \"relaxation yoga\" at the beautiful YMCA near her house. We took our precious baby girls who were barely toddling, and probably both still nursing,\u00a0placed\u00a0them in the uber-awesome childcare with seasoned staff and happy decorations and ironically ran to make the class. There were mats to get and blocks to place and blankets to fold; we filled our water bottles. Class began by lying down on the mat. Of course, \"lying down\" is not an exercise to me, so I was\u00a0immediately\u00a0frustrated because if I was going to take any time for myself then DAMMIT it was going to count and I was going to be in shape and healthy for my children, and as I laid there, cursing myself for thinking that anything with the word \"relaxation\" in the title was going to be my speed, the pager went off from the nursery, and I was called back to pick up my crybaby. As nice as the staff is, they did not appreciate my daughter screaming her head off. \n \nThen I went to Bikram yoga with Pollyanna.. where they crank up the heat and steam until you want to throw up as you pull your right foot up and over, opening up the pelvis.... I lasted the entire class and was congratulated for doing so. Then I felt dumb because I\u00a0realize\u00a0I could have left. It had not\u00a0occurred\u00a0to me that \"quitting\" was an option. Because dammit if I am going to take time for myself then it is going to matter and I am going to DO THIS. I went back one more time before I randomly hit my head on the tailgate of my not-so-mini-van and gave myself a bonk that rendered me unable to find the right words to say, and an ache in my head that took a week to get rid of. \n \nNext I tried some yoga/pilates torture with Squid. We went on Tuesdays for a month, for a 90 minute class. It was very hard, and the instructor of the first class made breathing sounds that sounded way too intimate for me to do anything but keep from giggling. The other two sessions I attended went well, but when I went to sign up for more I just could not justify spending $20 a class, when twenty bucks can buy so many other things. \n \nBut this morning I woke up and I wanted to go to yoga. I wanted to sit in a room with other bendy humans on a large flip-flop and contort my body, pull at my toes, and try to reach the center of my back... on purpose. I did not grow up in a family that encouraged regular exercise or sports... no discouragement... just no real nudge for athletic\u00a0achievement, which is funny, because I have great hand eye coordination and pretty good spatial awareness. I do however find that tasks which do not accomplish more than one thing at a time sort of gnaw at me. Treadmill, blech, but a hike? yes. a walk about? yes. strolling downtown to hear music in the square? Count me in. \n \n When Descartes and I are by ourselves without the kids, we lead a much less\u00a0sedentary\u00a0life; we walk places, go on hikes, park farther away, take public transportation. \u00a0I think we eat better too. \n \nI'm not sure what it is about both of our kids together, or is it Jake's muscle weakness.. and our need to use the wheelchair? \u00a0It all makes exercise seem impossible. And when they are at school I feel like I am catching up on work and paperwork and shopping. When would I take a full hour and have it be all about me? Well, apparently at 8:30 am after bus and school drop-off, at least for today, it worked. And maybe it will work on another day this week, or the next. Today I went to yoga, for me. Not to keep someone else company, or because there was a coupon. I went because my body wanted to move that way today. \n \nI'm hoping there are some busier days for our bodies in the future. Jake is inside that trailer in the picture there. He's grown out of his last bike trailer, and as Lucy is old enough now to learn to ride a bike, she's been asking more and more often to go on bike rides as a family. It's a from a company called  WIKE , and is both a bike trailer and a jog stroller. Jake doesn't have the skills to ride a bicycle yet, and he gets tired after about 1/2 mile of trail walking. This trailer will get us through three or four years of Jake growing, and hopefully provide our family with some great outdoor time. At the very least Jack had a great time in it being hauled across the soccer field last Saturday. \n \nI think parents with special needs kids forget to take care of themselves, I know I have. Moms generally have a habit of putting themselves at the bottom of the list. But Jake needs a lot of help physically, and if I don't \"increase my core strength\" and build up a little bit of muscle, it's going to become increasingly difficult to care for him without significant help. \n \nToday, I went to yoga. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p0IGYimohqU/TpnjFF3qwBI/AAAAAAAAD04/cyKqwffakW4/s1600/2011-10-15_12-45-36_468.jpg", "http://www.wicycle.com/special_needs_large_bicycle_trailer.php"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/10/stretch.html", "title": "\nStretch\n"},
{"date": "25 July, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nMy wedding anniversary sneaks up on me each year. It marks the passing of time for me much more clearly than my birthday ever will, because I can remember every year I've been married, whereas there are entire years and seasons I cannot remember from childhood (in spite of my freaky ability to recall events from the past). \n \nWe don't celebrate our anniversary like many couples do. We are hardly Hallmark, but we do exchange cards some years. I can't remember the last time we exchanged anniversary presents, and as much as I love fresh cut flowers, I haven't seen (nor would I hope to see) any long-stemmed red roses. \n \nOne thing Descartes has purchased for me over the years, and is much more representative of who we are... are fruit trees. On our property we have a cherry, an apple, a tangelo, a kumquat, an avocado, a Behr lime, a pomegranate, and the jewel of them all, the Meyer lemon tree. \n \nWhen I awoke this morning I remembered that Descartes gave me that Meyer lemon tree right after we got married. He gave me the lemon and the lime. They were in large heavy pots that were too big for them, and we put them out on the cracked little patio of the teeny, tiny post-war housing-boom-era house that was the first \"real house\" we lived in. That house was so small that if Descartes put his shoes down on the bedroom floor there was nowhere to walk. And it was oddly chopped up, because somehow in an 850 square foot house, we had two bathrooms and three bedrooms and a laundry room, and room for a piano and a dining room table. We were so happy not to be living under someone, or with someone, and buying those trees made it feel like it was really our little house. \n \nWe moved the next summer and took the trees with us to our new home on the Peninsula, a house near Descartes' shiny new office, and much closer to mine. It was hot there, unlike the misty cool of Berkeley. It was especially hot that summer, and the owner of our rental house chose to landscape with lava rock, which just sucked in the heat and kept it there. We left for a seven week tour of Europe to celebrate our one year anniversary and had to leave those poor little trees. I worried about them so much that I bought special water gel capsule things that were very expensive at the time, and I prayed they would last that long without water; we didn't have any friends yet nearby that we could even ask to water the plants. \n \nThe trees were barely alive when we came home, but they struggled through. We had one lemon that year. I remember because I used it as a garnish on a salmon I made my parents, and Descartes' parents when they came to see our little lava rock house. \n \n And then we got pregnant, and we decided to move again. We looked at houses, took a deep breath, and spent every dime we had putting a down payment on a house. \n \nThe trees are in the front yard of that house now, along with all the other fruit trees we've acquired. The lime is still properly a dwarf lime, it's branches spread about three feet across and it is just as tall. But the lemon tree forgot it's grafted roots and spreads 10 feet across and more than 6 feet high. It is prolific. There are lemons year-round, and they are sweet and amazing, and the perfection of what we think a lemon should taste like. \n \nI hardly ever water the lemon and it's still out there, right now, \u00a0flowering, and heavy with fruit. We will make home made lemonade this summer; Lucy still wants to make a stand on the corner. And I've chopped a bunch of them up to put in sangria which I served over 4th of July weekend. And I'll make candied lemon peel at Christmas, and serve twists and slices in whatever drink Squid decides is her favorite. And make lemon curd, and what else I'll do...the list is as long as the ways Bubba's mom makes shrimp. \n \nThe tree in the yard makes me happy every time I see it, even I hadn't really thought, until today, how far that tree had come with us. We've been through a lot of things in the last 13 years of marriage, and that tree has been around for all of it. \n \nWe've taken down wallpaper, made beautiful babies, put up pickles, and played on beaches. We have conquered MRSA, snaked all the drains, and robbed Peter to pay Paul. We've made homemade wild plum jam and our own beer, that was worth drinking. We have happily navigated the\u00a0loneliest\u00a0road in America, strapped babies in a LandCruiser to put them to sleep, and driven each other crazy. \n \nShowing our children a national park or pulling weeds in the front yard, we have the same goals in life, and we are good together. \u00a0And when it's hard, we are still good together. We make the best of things, and we treasure the moments that life is sweet. I am so grateful for every year we've had together. \n \n \n**** \n \n \n \n I love you and our life filled with lemons, lots of sweet, beautiful lemons. I would choose you again.

{"date": "05 October, 2011", "body": "\nI yell. Not all the time, and not at every body, but I yell, I raise my voice. I know I do. In fact I probably want to yell a lot more often, but somehow I have figured out that generally it's\u00a0not appropriate. People don't think very highly of you if you yell a lot. I know I don't think highly of people who yell a lot. \n \nI don't yell at my husband, or at least it's very rare these days. When we were first married he let me know that it was possible to have an argument without yelling. In fact, he thought it was possible to have a discussion and not an argument, something that I'm still working on, I suppose. \u00a0I grew up with a family that tends to come in fast and hot, solve it and move on. Descartes said, \"We're going to be together a long time, and I just won't talk with you if you yell.\" So I don't yell at him. I might holler across the kitchen, or from the back yard, \"Do you want cheese on your burger?\" No. \"Do you want another beer?\" Yes. I want to raise my voice sometimes when I am very passionate about something, but I try to be respectful of him, and our marriage, and I want our children to see that two people can disagree, come to a conclusion, and stay married, all while being kind to each other. \n \nAnd I don't yell at Jake, because, well that's not cool to yell at a special needs kid right? No one thinks that's okay. And I'm not sure he always processes everything I say when I'm just talking, so what would be the point of yelling at him? Asking him to hurry, or get off of something, or into something, or around something is often futile at best, so it just never occurs to me that I should yell. I've been frustrated, many, many, many times, and I know I've raised my voice in fear; yelling \"NOOOOO!\" as he darts away from me in a parking lot, or scrambles towards an open door...heading to a swimming pool. I've been tense before, used a stern voice, and cried and sobbed with him, but I don't think I've really yelled at him. \n \nI do yell in the car sometimes when I'm alone. I might yell when there are dangerous drivers, or radio news that reports of laws being passed that are discriminatory, or politicians who-- well, almost any politician can raise my ire a bit. I've yelled at my computer screen at other bloggers, but mostly these incidents are far between, I stew rather than scream. \n \nBut, I've yelled at my daughter.  \n \nI get frustrated and I yell. \u00a0I get exasperated when she does not do what she is supposed to do, like get her shoes on, or go to the bathroom before we leave the house, when I ask her to. Then the time rolls around to depart, and she, with several reminders, hasn't done whatever simple, but time consuming task it is. The consequence is that the whole family is then rushed, and possibly late. If we miss Jake's bus, that's a 40 minute drive to his school, one-way. This new school year has presented the scenario where there's about 12 minutes between the time Jake leaves for school and the time Lucy needs to be in class. Luckily the school is 4 minutes away, but we need to park and walk and the later we are the farther away we need to park... \n \nIt feels like we do not have a lot of room for anything else to be any more difficult than it naturally is. I need everyone,  we  need everyone, to do what they are supposed to do, when they are supposed to do it, and do it to the best of their ability, every single time. Which means that Jake needs help with every single thing, every single morning, but Descartes and Lucy and I should be able to get ourselves together. I make sure she has all of the components of her outfit. I 'do' her hair. I make her breakfast, and pack her lunch, and get her backpack ready to go because, I'm not an idiot, I know she's only five. \n \nBut when she doesn't do those other simple things? I yell. Sometimes loudly. \"NOW! GET YOUR SHOES ON RIGHT NOW!\" and of course it doesn't help anything. At all. It probably even makes things take longer. Then we get in the car and my heart is racing and Jake who hates being rushed, just wants to get the hell to school and away from us, and the day has begun with anger instead of calm, and we can't ever go back and make it different. Another whole day of our life has started with Jake agitated, me feeling like a crappy mom, and Lucy feeling like...like what? What emotion is she taking to school and sitting with for the day? And what have we gained? \n \nWhat I am wondering, is this: am I taking every single thing out on her when I am yelling about her tiny little white tennis shoes, because I can't yell at anyone else? Is it just my nature? Does she perhaps push me farther than every other thing on the planet? Am I destined to yell at my daughter, because that's a style of \"discussion\" I'm used to? \u00a0Is it that we are so alike that she knows all of my buttons and presses them systematically like she is testing a shuttle before launch?\u00a0And what am I teaching her by yelling? What will we have accomplished at the end of a verbal spar? \n \nI'm more aware of it lately. It feels like it's been happening more often, though it probably hasn't. It may be she's exerting\u00a0independence\u00a0in more places, which is age appropriate, but I don't want to have these interactions every day. I'm not calling her names, or demeaning her, I'm only ever repeating the task that was supposed to already have been done, but it makes me feel awful, even when I know it's not  that  dramatic or bad. And I'm sure it makes her feel awful too...\u00a0recently I've found myself apologizing to her hours later, and it almost always turns into a good, productive conversation with talk about how to do things better next time. But right now, it renders me unable to fall asleep at night, and makes me want to wake her up after she's been in bed, just to have some more positive moments in the day. \n \nDo you yell at your children? At just one of your kids? Is it a phase? \n \n \n\u00a0**** \n \n note: I wrote this post several weeks ago, just as school \nwas starting. Things have settled down into a better routine in the morning for \nall of us, and Jake is out of the 'episode' he was in. We have had a couple weeks of nearly yell-free mornings, but I think I need to continue to think about how I interact with Lucy because it feels like she could be an easy target for my frustrations.  \n \n \n a version of this post was an editor's pick today at\u00a0 OpenSalon.com \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://open.salon.com/blog/jennyalice/2011/10/05/i_yell_i_yell"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/10/i-yell-i-yell.html", "title": "\nI Yell.

While it usually feels a little frantic and unstructured during spring break, this year feels like some mostly calm time I've been able to spend with each of my kids, and around visits to the movies, day trips and the museum,\u00a0 I've been keeping myself busy. \n \n \n \nIt's Autism Awareness month. Since we are well aware of autism in this circle we have moved on to  Autism Acceptance  month instead. Thinking Person's Guide to Autism has a great  \"Slice of Life\" series  where we have given the same set of questions to autistics all over the spectrum. These are people in your neighborhood, in your classrooms. They work in the cube next to you, and skateboard at your local park. They are individuals, not statistics. Those 1 in 88s and 1 in 54s and all of that data that's been flying about? 'Those people' have always been with us, but we are getting better at spotting autism earlier, which will hopefully get everyone the support needed to be a happy, healthy, valued, and productive part of society. I know that \"awareness\" is still important because there are people that are ignorant, misinformed, or disinterested...even my spell check does not recognize 'autistics' as a word, and we have a long way to go, but we are focusing on acceptance around here.  \n \n \n \n \n \n I have another post up at Dandelion. I'm a  regular contributor there ,\u00a0 or at least I am when I can get my act together.  Dandelion is a great resource  for Bay Area parents, and is not just autism focused.\u00a0 I write there about three times a month. They have a very active events calendar, and happily take new events, so if you have a special needs benefit, auction, speaker series, or sibling group,  head to their calendar and ask to have it added . \n \n Last month Care.com asked me to  write an article  about  Learn the Signs, Act Early  campaign that the CDC has put together. It can be very emotional when you think your child is developing differently than other kids, but the important thing to do is keep your head on and check-in with a professional who can complete an evaluation of your child's development. With good information you can get your child every support he or she needs. I have more to say on this, and some good tips that I figured out when we were still figuring out our boy when he was very young.  \n \n \n \nThe wonderful Ellen Seidman, who writes Love That Max turned over her Parents.com column this month to celebrate Autism Awareness/Acceptance. Shannon wrote a lovely post about  Parenting Autism in the iPad and Internet Era.  \nEllen asked me so great questions, including what are three things I want other people to know about my kid. My number one answer was: \u201cJust because he can\u2019t talk doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t hear you. Kind words, \nmean words, he hears all of it. With my son, and with any person with \ndisabilities  we should start with, \u201cHello.\u201d \u201d You can read the entire post  here.\u00a0 \nI'd like to thank Ellen for hosting us in her column. I feel lucky to have her on \"my team.\" \n \n And I am  nominated at Babble.com  as a Top Autism Blog for Parents. Thinking Person's Guide to Autism has been nominated in the \"write-in\" section too, so  stop by and give us a thumbs up  if you think jennyalice.com or thinkingautismguide.com serves parents well. Maybe one of these days I will either a) make it on a list that does not require someone to vote or b) stop feeling like I need to chase votes once I am on a random list. Next year I am going to create a list of  Top Autism Blogs in My Family . I am pretty sure I will make the cut :) I was happy to see so many of my fine friends and their amazing words honored already, and knowing that we are all serving this community is a great feeling. \n \nThere are lots of other exciting things in the works.  TPGA \u00a0 has been all over the radio across the country, so if you thought you heard Shannon Des Roches Rosa, you probably did. And we are working on more venues for book readings. I was thrilled to find out last week that an education class for teachers is using the book as classroom text. If you know anyone who is interested in using the book as a text in an educational setting please contact me: jennifer dot myers at gmail dot com. I am happy to help get the book out to you. \n \nMy voice is hoarse and my house is a mess, but my heart is full and my kids are happy. \nBe well friends. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0692010556/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwmyersr-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0692010556", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/search/label/slice%20of%20life", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wiZxNIDPc38/T4WoNGjhZVI/AAAAAAAAFu8/SlFbuMkJ9q0/s1600/dandelion.jpg", "http://www.godandelion.com/component/k2/item/70-spring-break", "http://www.godandelion.com/component/content/article/18-2011-fall/67-mom-next-door-meet-jennifer-byde-myers", "http://www.godandelion.com/events", "http://www.care.com/special-needs-i-think-my-child-might-have-a-special-need-p1017-q12898102.html", "http://www.care.com/special-needs-i-think-my-child-might-have-a-special-need-p1017-q12898102.html", "http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/index.html", "http://www.parents.com/blogs/to-the-max/2012/04/09/uncategorized/parenting-autism-yes-our-kids-do-show-affection/", "http://www.parents.com/blogs/to-the-max/2012/04/02/uncategorized/parenting-autism-in-the-ipad-and-internet-era/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2012/03/every-kid-is-person.html", "http://www.parents.com/blogs/to-the-max/2012/04/09/uncategorized/parenting-autism-yes-our-kids-do-show-affection/", "http://www.babble.com/baby/baby-development/top-autism-blog-nominate/#", "http://www.babble.com/baby/baby-development/top-autism-blog-nominate/#", "http://www.babble.com/baby/baby-development/top-autism-blog-nominate/#", "http://www.facebook.com/thinkingpersonsguidetoautism"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/04/autism-around-and-about-and-aware.html", "title": "\nAutism: Around and About and Aware\n"},
{"date": "14 February, 2012", "body": "\nValentine's day is filled with chocolates and roses and lots of those horrid balloons and white stuffed bears that only come out in February. We do none of these things. My daughter saw a balloon with a cat on it recently and said, \"Let me guess Mom, you double-hate that one.\"  \n \nDescartes brought home some yummy stinky cheese and delicious bread. I usually\n make him a heart-shaped meatloaf (since I think he fell in love with my\n meatloaf before he fell in love with me), but this year I opted for  Banh Mi  one of my new favorite foods because what's not to love about these flavor-filled, flexible sandwiches? A new tradition is born. \n \nWe finished Lucy's valentine's cards just before bed last night...I felt guilty that I did not make cake pops, stick lollies to hand-made cards or shape hearts from doilies. She had no sense of this, being perfectly satisfied to give Phineas and Ferb, and Disney Princess cards to her kindergarten friends. Her teacher gave her a Disney princess card, as did half the class. Phew. And she didn't mind that her extra-special card to once certain boy in her class did not get her an extra-special card in return.  \n \nI went to Jake's Valentine's day party at Wunderskool. I had great intentions to make a special blah blah blah for each of the children in his class, and something even lovelier for each of the professionals who guarantee my child's health, happiness and safety while encouraging him to learn every day. I decided to show up instead. He saw me as I was walking in the parking lot and headed for the gate to greet me. \n \nI love the look my kids get when they see me across the room, slightly unsure of how long I've been standing there. They grow so fast these days it can take me awhile to find them in their circles of friends and teachers, and they both have darker hair than I imagine they have when they are apart from me. When they see me, there is a smile that spreads across their face, and it fills me up, makes me whole again. Lucy generally calls my name as if she has just greeted a dear friend from college she hasn't seen in years, and Jake will touch my arm with one finger, tracing the space between the radius and ulna. \n \nJake took my hand and held it later in class while we were waiting for some treats. He took my hand and lifted it to his mouth and kept it there against his lips. Of course I was chatting away with the aides in the class, teasing Jake and his friends, so it took me a moment to register that he was kissing me, kissing my hand. I thanked him for the very nice kiss and he put his arm around me and pulled me in laughing. It's nice to have those moments with him, especially because he is eleven, and there aren't that many more years when he is going to want to hold his mom's hand at all. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://battleofthebanhmi.com/"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/02/my-funny-valentines.html", "title": "\nMy Funny Valentines\n"},
{"date": "12 March, 2012", "body": "\n \nMy heart is racing, and it makes me unable to breathe. Tears swell up when I try to talk about it. It is a tragic story that has our entire community reeling.  \n \nA student from my son's school was  killed by his mother . Then she took her own life. \n \nThe articles keep indicating that she was overtired, had too much responsibility, and a lack of services keeps coming up. As one writer put it, she was  \"her child's nurse, his advocate, his playmate, his cook, his personal hygiene assistant, and his communicator. [She] was the mother of an autistic adult child. And she was her son's entire world, meeting his every need from the moment he was born. And she was desperately fearful for his future and exhausted beyond belief.\" \n \n but she murdered her child, and that's the story.\u00a0 \n \n If we let this story focus on the hardships of this woman, we are lost.\u00a0 The young man was  killed , and it undermines that significance when we read in another article that one could understand what \" would drive a parent of an autistic child to commit such a senseless act. \"  Anyone who says they \"understand\" is reinforcing the idea that my son, and   other people like him, are less valuable. It may be unintentional, but that sympathy starts to sound a lot like taking his life is somehow \"understandable,\" because things were hard and the young man required a lot of help.  It reduces a person into a list of burdens. \n \n Yes, we need better services, but we have always needed better services. Yes, we need support for parents who are life-long caretakers, and better adult programs for that magic age when children become adults overnight. We need infrastructure and life-skills support for adults with autism.  There was a program available for this family, but there really are not a lot of options when kids \"age-out\" of the education system. But these are all separate issues. These are the things we are working for. That's what we advocate for. And as for worry, there is not a single parent I know in this community that is not concerned about their child's future. Exhaustion, frustration, fear... \n \n It is not a list of reasons why  taking your child's life is justified. \n \nA pile of pity on this mother is not going to bring about more services. Are you outraged? Then vote people into office that believe the special needs community has a fundamental right to supports. That might get more services. Talk to your neighbors about shared responsibility and humanity and dispel the myth that we are leeches trying to live off the system. Those things might help get services for people like my son and the young man who was killed. \n \nAnd I do not believe absolution will encourage people to support me, or my son, or adults with autism. In fact it further ostracizes us; it makes us \"other.\" As a mother of a child with autism I walk under a cloud of suspicion now. Will I snap?\u00a0 I'll have more people looking and feeling sorry for me as if I have an anchor around my neck--and how will that make my son feel? Most people would never stop to think that showing so much sympathy, not for the victim, but for the person who killed him, might make adults with autism, who may rely on a network of caregivers, feel threatened, and more vulnerable, like there is no one they can trust. \n \nWhen it is even intimated that this killing was done out of mercy, it changes the value of my son's life. It says that his life is less worth living, but let me be clear there is no sliding scale on my son. \n \nMaybe it's empathy that's needed. Empathy takes more time than sympathy, but if you are able to  imagine life as my son  then it would be impossible to disregard him. Looking at life through his eyes would give you a sense of what his needs are, and of course what services must be provided, but more importantly you would be able to see the relationships he has. You would see the  snarky jokes  he's in on and how much he loves his family. You would see that he has intent and tries constantly to communicate what he is thinking. You would see him as a person, instead of \"person who needs to be taken care of.\" Maybe it would change things, but most of the time people just use the narrow scope of their own expectations and desires to determine the value of someone elses's life; most people are unable to separate their opinion from the other person's reality. \n \nAnd yes, Jack's life is challenging a lot of the time. But no one gets to say that he is less valuable because his life is hard, or because his life is not what someone else expected. He needs help with almost \nevery aspect of his life, and will continue to need a lot of help, but he doesn't need pity, or mercy and if you think he does, why don't you ask him? I'm sure he'd rather have you talk with him than about him. \n \nThere are no excuses. \n \nand we have so much more work to do. \n \n for more perspectives, please see these posts: \n \n Shannon Des Roches Rosa  at Squidalicious:   We MUST Do Better: Autism Tragedy and Transition to Adulthood squidalicious.com/2012/03/we-must-do-better-autism-tragedy-and.html \n Amanda Baggs  on Tumblr: Another Murder, Please No  http://youneedacat.tumblr.com/post/19105518455/another-murder-please-no \n Charlotte Moore  at Thinking Person's Guide to Autism: Sam, at Nineteen: On Transitions and Autistic School-Leavers thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2012/03/sam-at-nineteen-on-transitions-and.html \n Laura Shumaker  at SF Gate: Community Building 101 for Adults with Disabilities: FRED Conference provides actionable information  blog.sfgate.com/lshumaker/2012/03/07/community-building-101-for-adults-with-disabilities-fred-conference-provides-actionable-information   \n Kristina Chew  at Care2.com: Why Autism Education Should Go Up to Age 25 care2.com/causes/two-tragic-deaths-and-why-autism-education-should-go-up-to-age-25.html? \n Tiny Coconut  at I Have Things: No Justifications ihavethings.blogspot.com/2012/03/no-justifications.html \n \n \n \n \n a version of this post was the editor's pick today at\u00a0 OpenSalon.com   \n \n The opinions on this blog are my own, and in no way represent the many groups, foundations and communities with whom my name may be associated.\u00a0 \n \n This may be reposted with proper attribution and links back to this original post.

{"date": "25 December, 2011", "body": "\nI have been joking lately that the past decade was a 'little rough', but that the last nine months have nearly made up for it.\u00a0 It's not like we didn't have a whole lot of amazing, awesome things happen in the last ten years, because we did...children and new friendships and a cross-country trip, but lately it feels like things- all of those pieces are finally coming together. For as little sleep as I've had in the past few months, I feel more forward momentum again. My kids are so in-sync at school, and they are each developing into such beautiful people. My husband is happy, which always make my life happier. He loves the people he works with, and he's got plans to build tree houses. And I got an ice machine for Christmas. \n \nThat ice machine is so completely unnecessary that when I opened the box from my husband,\u00a0 I cried. It is just something I want, and he gave it to me just so I could be happy. We don't need it. It doesn't fix anything that's broken. It's not for the kids (though they like it too). It's for me. I like ice. I hate ice trays and I have always wanted an ice machine. The little automatic refrigerator one won't work without a $40,000 reconfiguration for the kitchen, so Descartes found one that fits into the window box behind the sink and voila: refreshing beverages.  \n \nI'm not that pleased that it was a material good that tipped me into the \"feeling blessed\" category, but I know that it did, and once you tumble over that line, it becomes so clear all the good that you have. I've always tried to be a thankful person, but perhaps it was just a little bit easier for me to see how my cup runneth over... once I put ice in it. And I am so thankful for all that I have, and all I have been able to do.  \n \n \n*** \n \n \nI have met so many amazing people this year, and learned so much.

{"date": "26 November, 2011", "body": "\nThe other day I was driving along, taking care only to watch my speed, and otherwise on autopilot. I was preoccupied making a list of all that I needed to do before we left for the holiday when I saw several bike riders turn onto the other side of the street. The last cyclists in line were a man and woman on a tandem bike, with a baby seat behind them. \n \nI burst into tears. \n \nIt\u2019s something I had forgotten; something that I used to want so badly. I wanted to ride on a tandem bike with my husband and our kid. I wanted to sail along the coast or through the grape vines of the wine country. We were going to be so fit and happy with our giggly baby cooing behind us. I had forgotten how many bikes I looked at online and those I looked at in stores while I walked around with my big pregnant belly. \n \nThen we had Jake. Then I broke my leg. Then Jake wasn\u2019t \u201cmeeting his milestones.\u201d Then there was the first neurologist. Then the dog died. Then there was a job change (and another job change). Then there was OT and PT. And Jake still didn\u2019t walk or talk, and he couldn\u2019t sit up well on his own, (and how would he ever had ridden in that bicycle seat?) Then there was early intervention preschool and we bought a new couch. Another dog died, and there was more this therapy and that therapy, and speech therapy. We bought a mini-van. Then we had Lucy, and a few more dogs, and Jake got settled and happy in his new school, and Lucy started kindergarten. \n \nAnd somewhere along the way, in the last eleven years, I forgot about the tandem bike. I forgot how important it had been and how badly I had wanted us to have \u201cthat life.\u201d  I forgot about the people I thought we would be, and the places those people would go. But watching that long bike whiz by tore something a little open in me and I had to pull over for a minute so I could get my bearings, and I could remember to be  thankful . \n \n \n*** \n \n \n \nI don\u2019t have a tandem bike. I probably won\u2019t ever have a tandem bike because it doesn\u2019t match up with my life anymore, and really, it probably never did. I didn\u2019t get to have \u201cthat life\u201d \u2013 but what some people forget, as we wallow around in \u201cwhat ifs\u201d, is that  no one had that life.  No one did because it never existed, except in the mind of some lady in a bike shop staring at  $3000 price tag. \n \nThe thing about being thankful, is that it requires you to  be thankful .  It\u2019s not about begrudgingly acknowledging that \u201cit\u2019s not what I wanted, but it\u2019s not so bad.\u201d Being thankful is recognizing all of the goodness that is, (and maybe seeing the pitfalls that you dodged).  Being thankful can be hard in the face of grief, or chronic pain, or financial struggle. It\u2019s hard when your kid has a meltdown in the middle of the holiday dinner, or your spouse just can\u2019t handle another minute with people and must retreat (leaving you to explain the absence). Being thankful might take a moment when you're just so tired, and every single thing seems so hard. \n \n \n \nBut there is good in every one of my days. I am so thankful for the life I have; for my smart, handsome husband \nwho has turned out to be a really great dad, and for my beautiful \nchildren who surprise me every day. I love my family, and where I live, \nand the friends I\u2019ve made. We have jobs, and interesting colleagues, and a house and cars that run \nand food in the fridge and the freezer.

{"date": "21 March, 2012", "body": "\nI wasn't asked to have a conference with Lucy's teacher, Ms. June, but Lucy asked me to make an appointment just the same. I sort of wanted to check-in anyway given that my daughter is already a different kind of person than I was at her age with her own way of learning things and her own worries and passions. \n \nShe is enough like me that I see myself --my mannerisms, for example, and I can hear my inflections in her voice, and yet she is enough different that I do not always understand what makes her tick when I tock. So I like to get other people's perspective on her whenever I can. We have lots of people who report about Jake to us, since he can't tell us his stories himself. There is even a journal that travels back and forth to school each day for Jake, but my daughter with her 31 other classmates... it would be impossible for any teacher to write a note about each child, each day. \n \n Sometimes I get anxious before I meet with teachers; education is different than the business world where I am generally confident. I have a reverence for teachers, and admiration for their service. And they do something I'm not sure I could do each day. Teachers, especially those that have been around for awhile,\u00a0 really know kids, so any comment about my child from a teacher is founded on having known hundreds and hundreds of children, and those opinions carry more weight to me. \n \nOf course the meeting went just fine. Lucy is on track and she is a good kid and she has friends, and she keeps writing the number 4 backwards. I saw a sampling of her work where I can see how much she has improved in just the last month with her letters and her coloring. Her pictures have great details and she seems to get the essence of the stories she hears. She's doing well. I was relieved, but I can't help but think there is more we should be doing. \n \nLucy's teacher and I chatted a bit more,\u00a0 debating piano lessons versus violin, tennis instead of soccer. Then about how being tall generally gets you more responsibility at an earlier age, at least that's what I experienced. And when Ms. June mentioned that Lucy shows a nice maturity she quickly told me about something that happened just today. \n \nThere is a ' little person ' at Lucy's school, and apparently some children had teased this boy at recess. When Ms. June took them back to the class (after having the story related to her by the yard duty aide) she sat the children down to have a discussion about differences. They talked about how it would feel to be made fun of for something that is just a part of you. They talked about all kinds of differences there can be, and Ms. June said that as soon as the conversation started Lucy raised her hand. I am paraphrasing but I have now heard the story from both Ms. June and Lucy, and they each related about the same thing.  \n \nWith conviction, Lucy told her classmates: \n \nMy brother has autism, and he has a wheelchair. He's different. But he still likes to decide things and make choices. We offer him two choices because he doesn't communicate like we do, but he still wants to decide things. Every kid is a person, so you should just say, \"Hello.\" and ask, \"How are you today?\" because even if they don't talk like you do, you should still say hello. \nThere I was, worried about how far along she is in reading, and stressed about the number four... and as it turns out, some of the hardest things to teach, respect, accepting differences, presuming competence..she's understands those things. She knows her non-verbal brother has opinions and that he deserves to be heard. She knows that \"every kid is a person.\" \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd perhaps I am most pleased that she has it written on her heart to stand and be heard. I'm grateful that she could face her peers and unabashedly advocate for that young man, and she did it on her own without prompting or practice. I am so proud of her.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rS0EQAB2TO4/T2laYnF3vFI/AAAAAAAAFaU/Z5dYU7evOS4/s1600/image", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarfism"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/03/every-kid-is-person.html", "title": "\nEvery Kid Is A Person\n"},
{"date": "12 June, 2012", "body": "\nMy daughter, my baby, turned six yesterday. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShe is beautiful and kind and quick and loves to curl up sweetly in my arms to start the morning. Each day I am equal parts terrified and delighted to be her mother. I know I will mess up a lot. I have already expected so much from such a small person, but she rises to the occasion, and I suppose, ultimately, so have I. She makes me rethink my inner core and calibrates my moral compass like no one else I know... except perhaps her brother. \n \n And she loves  her brother  so much. She cares for him, she cares about him, and she cares about his future and the futures of his friends and classmates. Though she is always aware, and works hard to support his needs, she gives him only enough room to provide for disability, and after that she bickers with him as any other sibling pair might do. They fight over blankets in the car on road trips, and she saves half of almost anything good she has so he can have some when she gets home. The natural and easy way she accepts differences by not bothering to mention them unless she doesn't understand something, makes me have hope for her generation that there will be more tolerance in every way.  She doesn't stare, she says \"Hello.\" \n \nShe loves to drive in her Daddy's car, begging him to take off the roof of the Jeep, and sings along with the cranked up music, asking him to take the long way. She picks up jingles from television, and sings them too, with a rock star voice.. .who knew that the insurance commercials could sound so powerful? And when she's watching tv, she understands marketing, thinks that little girls should look like little girls, and not minitature grown ups, and knows to say \"Can you add this cool toy to my list?\" instead of flat-out asking for it. \n \n She's not boring. She can carry a conversation, and knows who the president is, and about reproductive rights, the importance of voting, and with her proclamation: \"You should be able to love who you want to.\" it's clear she supports equal rights for all when it comes to marriage, raising children, and living life. She has a crush on the boy who has long wavy brown hair, but has some thoughts about living with us for a long time. She's not yet sure she wants children when she grows up, and has thought about going to University locally (ahem, that would be Stanfurd). Her only thoughts on \"leaving us\" are to get a cool house with her brother to help him out.  \n \nShe can be counted on. When there are times I urgently need her assistance with something because I don't always have enough arms to keep everyone safe, she makes it clear that every talk we've ever had is stored in her head, and she remains calm and helps exactly as she has been taught to. She always locks the gate behind her.  \n \nShe is too much, over affectionate, loud, bouncy, \"on fire\"...she is a cross between Tigger, and me, I suppose, with a dash of initial reserve that is just enough to remind me that she is my husband's child too. She mostly puts all of her energy to good use, and though I wonder who she is when I'm not around, when we got a note sent home from her after-school care it included an award: \n \nFor being wise beyond your years, listening to others, and seeking not only to be understood but to also understand others. \nI am trying to remember that she will only be this small now, and she is already taller every day. When she lies down in the tub, her hair streaming out like a mermaid, I can't help but notice that her feet touch the other end, and in another month or two she will need to bend her legs to to try to get that calm of peaceful floating. We'll need to find another place where she can feel light like that, because I want her to carry that feeling with her as she grows up and has more responsibilities.  \n \n \n******* \n \n My precious girl, I love you more than all the leaves on all trees that\u00a0 \n \n have ever been and ever will be, and then I love you more.\u00a0 \n \n You are my best-favorite. \n \n Happy Birthday.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M8GK_0d9PBQ/T9dv8fX18DI/AAAAAAAAHig/jJ1KRD7CG2w/s1600/CIMG2620.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gmGeD5QZBI0/T9dw25G_gNI/AAAAAAAAHiw/h6by_oaj9dQ/s1600/092206_15581.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fu3BkMuz9N8/T9dvt_3TRhI/AAAAAAAAHiY/kANg_PN_AAI/s1600/katie+crazy+hair+day.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FZbNR6DDh08/T9dwfbcOJSI/AAAAAAAAHio/0NMN97N8FvQ/s1600/2012-04-01_10-55-43_768.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/06/where-are-you-going-my-little-one.html", "title": "\nWhere Are you Going My Little One?\n"},
{"date": "19 April, 2012", "body": "\n I heard a crunchy sound from a mouth that should have been empty. It \nis a horrible feeling when I think one of my children has eaten \nsomething dangerous. We've been pretty lucky around here, the most \ninedible items actually swallowed aren't really inedible, the \ncut-off tops to strawberries, nibbles of wine corks, a little raw onion,\n a small piece of crayon; nothing really harmful at all. \n \nSo when I\n heard the crunchy, chomping-on-china-plates sound, I begged \nJack to spit out what was in his mouth. He laughed as I followed him \naround the kitchen, and tried desperately to put my finger in the side of \nhis mouth. Just as I was wondering how much worse it was going to be \nwhen he bit off and swallowed my finger along with the glassy sounding \nbit, he pushed a small white object out between his lips at me, and it \nbounced between my fingers and clinked like porcelain onto the floor. He smiled and ran \nacross to the living room. \n \n It was a tooth. His tooth, of course. \nHe's still a kid who is going to lose teeth. All at once he is both too \nyoung and too old for that, but he's 11 1/2, so he is actually right on \ntime to lose those molars. And whether I am ready or not, many milestones occur without regard for \nability or disability. He grows physically, and changes mentally by the \nminute these days. \n \nHe's just at that point between being a little boy and a young man. In some ways, he'll always be my baby, just like I am my Daddy's \"Jennyalice, \" and \nMomma's \"BabyGirl,\" but I need to remember that he is growing up. It's challenging sometimes to gauge things because his known abilities are so uneven and his \nexpressive communication requires a patience on my part that I strive \nfor rather than come by naturally. But even if Jack is not at grade level \nin math, it doesn't mean that he might not have crushes on girls, or \nstart to have other new interests. We've already recognized that he is \nattentive to Myth Busters, and done with Dora. \n \nI'm trying to stop \nusing the word \"potty,\" and use instead, \"bathroom\" or \"toilet.\" I hold \nmyself back a little bit when he is in front of his classmates before I \nsmother him with kisses. When the topic of moving from one classroom \nsetting to another came up at his school, I asked  him  what he thought, \nand what classroom he thought he should be in. \n \nAs a society we \noften infantalize people with disabilities, especially those people who \ndo not speak typically. People who use AAC devices aren't always given \ncredit for all of the nuance of thinking they may have because their \ndevice 'speaks' in straightforward, quipped language. And those who do not \nuse devices at all are often thought to have no thought at all. In the absence of a clear, articulated sentence, it is still important, or rather, imperative,\u00a0 to consider Jack's opinion first in any situation that \ninvolves him, and to be respectful to ensure that, as much as possible,\n barring safety concerns, Jack be in charge of his body and his actions.\n  \n \nIt would be easier to push and pull him where I want, maybe. It \nwould be faster if I made the choices: vanilla or chocolate, green or \nred, apple or pear. It would be convenient to use only my desires to \ndictate where we go and what we do next. I'm guessing this is just part of the parenting process in some ways, when our children are young we control most of their environment, and some of that control naturally falls away with a typical child who asserts \nthemselves with voice or physical action. With a kid like mine sometimes you have to look carefully for the cues that tell you to step aside. The longer I have this job,\n the more I realize that it is my goal as a parent to teach my children \nto make good choices on their own, and to support them so they are confident in\n the decisions they have made. \n \nAnd as they grow older, I will encourage  both \n of my children to give thought to what they want out of this life.\u00a0 As individuals they need to consider what is the best thing for themselves, for their family, and \nfor their community with any choice they make. It may always be harder for me to tease out what Jack thinks is important, and to discover his desires, and I recognize that he may need help executing many of his choices.. but he deserves to be heard. \n \nWhen all of those little baby teeth are gone there will be a precious, possibly-pimply, fuzzy, young man standing in my kitchen, and we should all want to know what he thinks. \n \n \n \n a version of this post was the  editor's pick at OpenSalon  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o6DpgLmA-SQ/T4-5G3H9lyI/AAAAAAAAGDw/ZIo1ljK8DxE/s1600/2012-04-11_16-09-07_796.jpg", "http://open.salon.com/blog/jennyalice/2012/04/19/autism_acceptance_growing_up"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/04/autism-acceptance-growing-up.html", "title": "\nAutism Acceptance: Growing Up\n"},
{"date": "02 May, 2012", "body": "\nI just retold a story to a friend about a life-changing incident that happened to me when I was five years old. It is so vivid: my little blonde curly-headed self standing there in the driveway next to my blue bike with the pink flowered banana seat. We didn't have helmets then, and I had already shed my training wheels. It was a sunny afternoon, like almost any other afternoon in Southern California, but that one conversation shaped part of who I am permanently. It is something I think about almost every single day, sometimes multiple times in a day. \n \nOne conversation when I was that young and those words, and what I did,  those words inform my character and actions every day .\n I am 40 now, with a lifetime of education, and conversation and \nyet ten minutes, 35 years ago changed me, and for the better. I could \nhave learned the lesson another way, farther down the road, but it made \nlife easier for me having that knowledge early-on. And I am so grateful. \n \nI won't tell the whole story because I know who reads this blog, or might read this blog, and telling the story out loud, here, would change it, and it would read the wrong way, and sound self-aggrandizing, but there is something that struck me as I shared the story privately.  \n \n What will my children remember? \n \nI realized that I can remember so many details about what happened, and what was said. I remember being flush with shame, and wanting to take back what I had done, even if no harm had come of it. And I got a good look at how a face crumples when someone is disappointed in me. Then I realized that my daughter is almost 6, and if I can remember being that age, she will too. And my son, well, he's eleven and a half, so it's pretty clear that when he writes his memoirs I am in trouble. \n \nThe words I say, my actions, my goals, and the way I celebrate or despair, my kids are watching all of it. What imprint am I making? Am I giving them the right lessons to lean upon when they're 40?\u00a0 And what am I leaving behind after talking with friends over coffee? What do they recall later, after we have waved \"goodbye\" in the parking lot? \n \nLuckily there is tomorrow, and probably many days after that to get this parenting thing, or some part of this thing right.\u00a0 I will mess up.\u00a0 I will be short-tempered, or hurry when we should have enjoyed the journey. I will never get it all mastered, but tomorrow I am going to do my best to make sure that whatever my children might recall of these years, some of it will be worth remembering. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GcOd1TeDCd4/T520V8KqEjI/AAAAAAAAG5w/-3EjUglNBfY/s1600/2012-04-29_14-19-34_145.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/05/remember-me.html", "title": "\nRemember Me\n"},
{"date": "11 July, 2012", "body": "\nWhat a great week at the Lake house. Happy, tired kids and happy tired parents. Someone told me I looked rested today, someone else said I looked like I'd been \"hiking or something.\" All I know is that I had a great time. \n \n \n \nWe had Sage and her family come up for a few days, and while I didn't manage\n to get a picture with all the kids together,\u00a0 they got to do lots of things that \nthey like. We went swimming at the beach, and went out on the boat and  identified a rare bird for our neighborood . Jake got to chill on our hike, dribbling pine needles and rocks through his hands on the trail that used to be the  train bed for the railroad  that was built to supply the workers at Hetch- Hetchy. \n \n \n\u00a0Kids and grownups scrambled all over boulders and only one foot of one adult, and one foot of one child got wet in the fun. Not bad. There were very few scuffles amongst the kids that were not resolved in under 5 seconds, and every single one was caused by Lucy being in someone's space. If ever there was a child who wanted a big sister it's Lucy. Thank goodness we have so many close family friends who will be able to step in to that role over the years. \n \n \n \n \n \nJake wore a hat. Woot! This is something we've been encouraging for the last two years, and it is really feeling like we can almost call it a success. With a history of melanoma in the family, it's especially important that we do what we can to protect the kids' skin. He lets me put sunblock on his face now too. Those ears get sun blocked every day, rain or shine! \n \n \n \nLucy got to drive around with the roof open on Daddy's Jeep. Even better when Descartes went back to the Bay area for a couple of days I got to drive around in the Jeep with the music and the sunshine and the bluetooth connection, and the awesome handling of the car, it is really hard not to smile the whole time you are driving that car... especially if you are driving it in to Yosemite because Oh My there is so much there right above your head. \n \n \n \nI took the kids in to Yosemite by myself on Monday when Descartes went back to the city to work for a couple days. It was exhausting and awesome. Being responsible for little people all by yourself a long way from home with no local safety net is apparently something that gives me a bit of anxiety. It also made me feel powerful, strong and very cool. I'm sure driving with the wind in my hair and sun on my shoulders helped me get through. Did you know I am younger, more beautiful, and always recycle when I am in that car? Did I mention that we love the car?  \n \nLucy asked me to take a picture of her where she is holding up the biggest rock ever. I think she got these crazy photo ideas from Mali and Iz. I will be studying how to get proper forced perspective shots so we can get them over with. By the time I take her to Pisa I want to be able to get that cool shot with her  kicking over the Leaning Tower . \n \n Lucy is loving being a little Junior Ranger. In fact, when asked to wear a hero costume to camp past Friday she chose her ranger outfit with hat and vest, because she thinks Park Rangers are like \"heroes for the planet.\" This is one endeavor I do not mind indulging so that means a pin purchase and stamps from the ranger stations in our little passport book. It's been a learning experience for all of us, because as it turns out I did not know that garbage that you might find in the National Park that is over 50 years old should be treated as a historical items. So congratulations all you hippies who left your soda cans in the campground, they are now artifacts! \n \n \n \n \n \nWe explored an area new to us in the Yosemite Valley, the Happy Isles Nature Center. Most of it was very wheelchair friendly, and we were able to park about two miles closer with the disabled placard making the actual hiking part possible. We've been very good about asking Jake if he wants to walk or ride. I forget sometimes that his low tone means that he really will be tired and might not even be able to walk well towards the end of the day. \n \n He and Lucy have both been pretty good sports given each of their limitations. She's only 6, and her little self gets tired out seemingly out of the blue. I think her blood sugar drops and she just plummets. She goes from greatest kid ever to, uhm, not the greatest kid ever. We can fix that most of the time with something from the bottomless snack bag that goes with us wherever we go.  \nThere is so much to see and do, and there are all of those animals and birds to check out, I'm not sure that we will ever get tired of this beautiful place. It doesn't hurt that there is pretty decent pizza and if we stay too late, there's that awesome, inexpensive all-you-can-eat buffet in the evenings in Curry Village. We even discovered that the Pizza Deck has good beer (and commemorative glasses!) I'm not much for Hefewisen, but on a hot day at altitude it sort of hit the spot. \n  There was an Independence day barbecue, which included an airshow, and music, and many multi-generational families. The world is small, so of course the table next to us had a family that had retired to the Lake from my hometown, and the father had worked with special needs children in his first years of teaching. His daughter went to my rival high school. And there were many people who just stopped by to say hello to Jake. What was nice is that they all said hello to him before they said hello to me. Jake thought the tiny pony was pretty funny but chose not to pet him.  \n \n We did a lot of boating on the lake. This kind of cruising makes Jake very happy. He happily wore his life jacket and made me feel at ease enough to sip wine. Some days we took the boat out once in the morning and again for a wine and cheese cruise. It is such a luxury, and I cannot thank my husband enough for his ease on the water, parking the boat, picking us up on other docks. He makes it all look so easy. For the big celebration we entered the boat parade and while they don't give out a second prize, apparently we would have won it. It was supposed to be an historic event, so my darling husband bought hula-hoops and we went for the gold with Olympics 2012. That's the London Eye and Big Ben. We also had a cauldron and the Olympic torch. Little Lucy yelled \"GO USA!\" for about an hour. We had no colored paint for anything, so if you'd like to know how to make latex house paint go from beige to slightly not beige we don't really know the proportions, but it took coffee grounds, coffee, soy sauce, and a dash of Worcestershire. Pathetic, but very fun. Big Ben is very textured, and smells just plain odd. \n \nJake went back to summer school and has had positive reports filled with happy sounds and \"cooing\" as his teacher told me today. Lucy is settled into a new camp where she swims every day, so that little fish is happy and completely over tired by 4:30pm. I am trying to get back to work after weeks of sketchy Internet service. And Descartes and I are both trying to get back to a world where beer with lunch is not normal, and there is no ordering two-for-one pina coladas for me. \n \nTomorrow is music in the park which we all enjoy, and it just makes me feel all the more thankful because it seems every city in which I rest my head, is a pretty awesome place. Cheers! \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OSCiN7k_-8I/T_E0wn5ORCI/AAAAAAAAIRA/SqQ-xzABYQk/s1600/2012-07-01_10-36-25_367.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooper_Swan", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hetch_Hetchy_Railroad", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9y2MRh5yLLI/T_E0wpjviQI/AAAAAAAAIRA/Uaa14Kl0_vk/s1600/2012-07-01_10-14-13_482.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SnvoonjgX9Y/T_xY_TFP1BI/AAAAAAAAItw/QwBwNFve0Xo/s1600/photo.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-S1KVWAfxBS8/T_xY_Zle9hI/AAAAAAAAItw/5N3vOXvvxPI/s1600/photo.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OuclrnaCbI0/T_xY_XSXVPI/AAAAAAAAItw/b__xViNDDqw/s1600/2012-07-02_14-02-54_585.jpg", "http://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/interesting-perspective-trick23.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p8ExASjNTGg/T_xY_SU-KtI/AAAAAAAAItw/ydyLc4z4oPU/s1600/2012-07-02_11-22-45_402.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CconAYjJeQg/T_xY_X__aII/AAAAAAAAItw/ShuggfLpak4/s1600/2012-07-02_11-21-59_950.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qc6_opVrjyQ/T_xY_VsXUKI/AAAAAAAAItw/0vr_6Ts3yEM/s1600/2012-07-05_15-05-54_310.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WDdNB1nvLM0/T_xY_fzghfI/AAAAAAAAItw/LSky0NeGO5E/s1600/2012-07-05_13-10-26_37.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SnMzXX4RT4w/T_xYOaJiL3I/AAAAAAAAItY/w53gpIGNsXI/s1600/2012-07-06_17-31-40_8.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QIDmR-pWVus/T_xXvuUEGVI/AAAAAAAAItQ/inFd6kylteU/s1600/IMG_6665.JPG"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/07/busy-days-of-summer.html", "title": "\nBusy Days of Summer\n"},
{"date": "20 December, 2012", "body": "\nWe need to make sense of things. That's what we do as parents, as people, we want things to make sense, because if we can identify \"why\" something happened, we can make it happen next time, or we can make something better, or we can prevent it from ever occurring again. We look for patterns. We\u00a0 find the anomaly. We constantly work to smooth the landscape of our mind because it is more comfortable. \n \nWe categorize people, both publicly, and privately, in our own minds, so we can determine how we will interact with that person. We tune our language to be understood. We form ideas about new people based on who we have already sorted and collected.\u00a0 And without much thought, we determine how much attention, or affection each person should receive. We determine those for whom we will advocate, and who we will help. \n \nWe use all of our previous personal experiences when we start again each morning. Every action: what to eat, what to wear, what time to leave our home, and which route to take to our destination is based on the life we have already led, and what we have learned from stories we have heard and stored. Hopefully we continue to gain small insights every moment to make our next days easier, and more efficient. We are most at ease when we know what to expect, and what will happen next. \n \nThis is one of the systems of being human. We look for patterns, we categorize and we use the information we've gained by sorting and sensing and making minor adjustments. It's a system that works almost every day. It works just fine until something occurs outside of our perceived normal, and then we try to use it anyway, even if we shouldn't. \"Normal\" days are parsed rather easily, but\u00a0 when the parameters cannot contain what we have seen, we aren't so sure what to do.\u00a0  \n \nLast Friday, December 14, 2012 was not norma- and there should never be anything normal about young children being shot in their classroom. There is nothing worth repeating in a situation where people die teaching. \n \nSo what did people do when what happened was so far out of what we expect should happen at an elementary school? What did some news media outlets do? They began to try to make sense of something that has no order, no reason, and no possible solid logic. They tried to categorize someone so we would be able to identify that person, and we would know, next time, what to expect so we could prevent another tragedy. \n \nThey concluded that Adam Lanza was not just a murderer, he was an autistic murderer.\u00a0 They began to categorize him, call him out as separate, as different, so we could know he wasn't like us; that there was a reason for his unbelievable crime.  \n \nIt would be too painful to pin it on being male, or white, or a twenty-something-- those categories are too broad, they encompass too many people, and those descriptors do not distance the evil from the majority of good, so they went with Asperger's. Asperger's with it's undefined edges, and it's different-than status. Asperger's, mysterious in origin on a spectrum with changing definitions. It was easier to use autism; it gave their story a \"hook.\" But that kind of reporting is lazy because Asperger's didn't make Adam Lanza a killer, nor did the color of his skin, or his gender for that matter. Adam Lanza had mental health issues, and access to firepower that is beyond the scope of 2nd Amendment rights.  \n \nIntimating that Asperger's is an underlying contributor for murderous behavior is sadly ironic too, since autistics, and people with disabilities in general, are more likely to be the victims of abuse. The World Health Organzization (WHO)  states  \"children with disabilities are 3.7 times more likely than \nnon-disabled children to be victims of any sort of violence, 3.6 times \nmore likely to be victims of physical violence, and 2.9 times more \nlikely to be victims of sexual violence.\" And adults are 1.5 times more likely to suffer from violent crimes than their \"typical\" counterparts.  \n \nIt would be easy to close my computer, turn off the television, and let all of this go away, because sadly, people will forget. They will get wrapped up in their Holiday travel, and their own children's birthday's before they remember the families that will have those celebrations forever changed by the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary school. We will forget, or never know,  the names of the victims .\u00a0 If history has shown us anything, we will only really remember the name of the person who committed the crime. Of course we do, because we label them, build an image of what that person appears to be so we can spot someone like him in a crowd. \n \nSo what will happen as we move on from this horrible incident, what has happened already, is that the man who killed 26 people in an unimaginable fusillade will most likely be remembered, as \n \n\"Adam-Lanza-He-was-autistic.\" \nAnd autistics everywhere, of every age and gender and ability will have another hurdle in front of them, preventing them from being accepted as full citizens in our society. Discrimination, and disenfranchisement are already pervasive without adding \"killer.\" If we do not say anything, if  you  do not say anything the next time someone identifies the shooter that way, if we do not speak up, we may as well have been saying it ourselves; just paving the way for more discrimination, more fear, more retaliation in ways subtle or bold.  \n \nSo interrupt the person who says it. Force that person back to being uncomfortable because  what happened is painful and doesn't make sense . Make them un-categorize, and untie the relationship between \"autism\" and \"potential mass murderer\" because it just isn't true. \n\u00a0  \n \n \nOther reading about this subject: \nShannon Rosa on Blogher  We need to Talk About Adam Lanza \n \nEmily Willingham on Slate\u00a0  Autism, Empathy, and Violence: Asperger\u2019s Does Not Explain Connecticut Shooting \n \nKassiane Sibley on TPGA  A Plea from the Scariest Kid on the Block   \n \nPaula Durbin-Westby  Mother with Asperger Syndrome Grieves Sandy Hook Elementary Victims \nJohn Elder Robison on Psychology Today  Asperger's Autism, and Mass Murder \n \nAutism Women's Network  AWN\u2019s Appeal to Media Sources Covering Newtown, CT \nJoin:\u00a0  Autistics, Not Monsters  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.who.int/disabilities/violence/en/index.html", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/15/sandy-hook-shooting-victims-names_n_2307354.html", "http://www.blogher.com/we-need-talk-about-adam-lanza", "http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/12/17/asperger_s_and_newtown_school_shooting_autistic_does_not_mean_violent.html", "http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2012/12/a-plea-from-scariest-kid-on-block.html", "http://Mother with Asperger Syndrome Grieves Sandy Hook Elementary Victims", "http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/my-life-aspergers/201212/asperger-s-autism-and-mass-murder", "http://autismwomensnetwork.org/article/awn%E2%80%99s-appeal-media-sources-covering-newtown-ct", "http://www.facebook.com/AutisticsNotMonsters"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/12/making-sense-of-sandy-hook.html", "title": "\nMaking Sense of Sandy Hook\n"},
{"date": "23 July, 2012", "body": "\n In case you're wondering, I'm pretty sure my son is not going to grow up to be a mass murderer. Thanks Joe Scarborough--it only takes one idiot to undo advocacy. \n \"You don't want to generalize,\" said MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, but that's exactly what he did when he said that James Holmes, the young man in custody as the Aurora, Colorado shooter,\u00a0 was \"on the autism scale.\"  \n \n \n \n \n Visit NBCNews.com for  breaking news ,  world news , and  news about the economy \n \n \u00a0\"As soon as I hear about this shooting, I knew who it was. I knew it was\n a young, white male, probably from an affluent neighborhood, \ndisconnected from society \u2014 it happens time and time again. Most of it \nhas to do with mental health; you have these people that are somewhere, I\n believe, on the autism scale,\" said Scarborough, whose son has \nAsperger's syndrome. \"I don't know if that's the case here, but it \nhappens more often than not. People that can walk around in society, \nthey can function on college campuses \u2014 they can even excel on college \ncampuses \u2014 but are socially disconnected.\" \n What compounds the irresponsibility of his statement is that Scarborough is the parent of an autistic child. So he managed in one sentence, one very publicly stated sentence, to make autistics out to be dangerous potential murderers, and make parents of children with autism look like asses.  \n \n Here is one autistic adult's perspective, her\u00a0  open letter to the media: \n \n I am an Autistic adult. In the wake of \nthe tragic shootings in Aurora, Colorado, my community was sitting not \nonly in the sadness that all such tragedies bring, but also in fear and \nanticipation that once again, we would be your scapegoat. Once again, \nyou would start declaring that we and the killer had the same neurology \nbefore the bodies were even cold, before the initial tears had dried. And again, you did not disappoint. \nAgain, you went to declare the killer mentally ill or Autistic before \nyou even possibly had a chance to talk to anyone qualified to make those\n calls. Again, you cast yet another layer of suspicion on my community. \nAgain, you made me someone to be feared. \n \n It would be lovely if Scarborough could apologize in as grand a way as he made his first declaration, but news cycles don't really encourage apologies. It would be even better if he took the time to educate his viewers about autism, perhaps he could, I don't know, have an autistic on his show, or talk to one, like his own son.  \n \n A journalist, Mike Elk, who  recently \"came out\" as autistic ,\u00a0 asked Scarborough to educate:\n \n \n Hopefully, Mr. Scarborough will retract his remarks, as well as host a broader discussion on Autism to spell away the many stereotypes of Autism often spoken by non-Autistic people such as himself. \n What message did Scarborough send his own son with his proclamation this morning? What kind of self-loathing is he trying to instill in his child? This kind of language and the stereotypes it perpetuates makes it harder for young autistic adults to move through daily life, it stirs up anxiety in every adult autistic that we have once again gone back two steps, or more, and it makes other parents guilty by association.\u00a0 \n \n It's easy to have a gaffe and I am all for allowing someone to apologize for something misspoken or said in haste. Talking heads are bound to make a mistake now and then, but then I was thinking, I'm a parent of an autistic child, and I know many autistics, and it did not occur to me  at all  to diagnose the shooter with autism. Troubled? Yes. Disturbed? Of course, but autistic? Really? Where did that even come from? Because someone said he was a loner? The fact that Scarborough \"knew who it was\" is so troubling and disturbing, because it leads me to believe that this is not a gaffe in any way, not a \"whoopsie\" but fundamentally the way he thinks.\u00a0 \n \n and that, to me, is dangerous.  \n \n Sign the petition that Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg created demanding a retraction. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Other people, other posts: \n Emily Willingham:\u00a0  Mental illness, autism, and mass murder, or why Joe Scarborough needs to shut up   \nLydia Brown at Autistic Hoya:  All I Want to Do is Weep  \nJess at Diary of a Mom:  Dear Joe  \nLydia Brown  The Dangers of Misrepresentation  \nDavid Cullen  The Unknown Why in the Aurora Killings \nASAN  Statement \nCaroline Miller at Child Mind Institute  James Holmes and the Downside of Amateur Diagnoses \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/", "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032507", "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032072", "http://timetolisten.blogspot.com/2012/07/open-letter-to-media-in-wake-of-aurora.html", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-elk/coming-out-of-the-closet_b_392284.html", "http://www.change.org/petitions/joe-scarborough-msnbc-retract-your-statements-about-autism-and-the-colorado-shooting", "http://www.emilywillinghamphd.com/2012/07/mental-illness-autism-and-mass-murder.html", "http://autistichoya.blogspot.com/2012/07/all-i-want-to-do-is-weep.html", "http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2012/06/dangers-of-misrepresentation.html", "http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2012/06/dangers-of-misrepresentation.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/opinion/sunday/the-unknown-why-in-the-aurora-killings.html?_r=2", "http://autisticadvocacy.org/2012/07/asan-expresses-deep-concern-over-scarborough-remarks-suggesting-aurora-shooter-on-the-autism-spectrum/", "http://www.childmind.org/en/press/brainstorm/james-holmes-downside-amateur-diagnosis"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/07/scarborough-on-autism.html", "title": "\nScarborough on Autism\n"},
{"date": "31 July, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nI saw the piled boxes at the store, each one containing a pair of galoshes and a matching umbrella. I hate umbrellas. They just break, or the wind blows them the opposite way turning you into a flower bending in the wind, rain soaked and wilting. And when you've used an umbrella and arrived at your destination then you need to carry the umbrella around, or put it in some bucket at the door where it will most likely be stolen. They never seem to dry out, leaving wet marks on the seat in the car, or on the floor. Their drips of water make the entry way dangerous. \n \nI remember liking umbrellas when I was little. Do you remember the clear ones that came all the way over your head and down to your shoulders, but you could still see? I always wanted one of those, and I'm not sure why I never got one. \n \nSo all of those things go through my head as I am standing there looking at cute fireman galoshes with red umbrellas, and black polka-dotted galoshes with a shiny matching polka-dotted umbrella. The pallet of items had just come in, but I know how these places work, and if you aren't there when the awesome thing comes through you are out of luck, so I stood there and decided what kind of mom I was going to be. \n \nMy daughter loves umbrellas, and galoshes. She loves matchy-matchy. She loves having the specific gear for an activity. She likes having things that are similar to the things her peers have. But all last year, I denied her having a stupid umbrella because I don't like them. I didn't see it as a necessary item for a 5 year old who never walks in the rain farther than the distance from the car to the classroom door, or our own back door. When I was in kindergarten I walked to school, but I still think I got a ride on rainy days. I did not see the point of starting some umbrella habit, when I could explain, and demonstrate the practicality of hats, which are both fashionable and functional, and can keep you warm and your head dry. I thought that her waterproof jacket and hat were plenty to get her through the misty mornings and occasional downpour.\u00a0 So that's what we did last rainy season, we went by my rules.  \n \nAnd every chance that kid got she would borrow a friend's umbrella, even if it was just to walk across the playground, or five feet from her friend's coat hook to her own. I almost think that she was the only little girl who didn't have an umbrella of her own last year. Part of me was a bit smug thinking that I was raising this more practical and flexible child who knows that rain is just water, and it will dry. I thought that I had gotten away with something, and that my daughter was more mature having moved right on past that stage of little sets of things for girls that coordinate and fit for only one season. \n \nStanding in the aisle of the giant store, air conditioning blasting, the rainy season more than four months away I thought differently; no longer feeling like I wanted to be practical. Instead I really, really, wanted to give her what she wanted, a matching umbrella and rain boots, because she is growing up so fast, and really, how many years are there left when she will want to look all that cute and buttoned-up, and so over protected from drizzle. I got a bit choked up thinking about how many things she just will never do again, which leads me right to the fact that we aren't having any more kids, so not only is it my daughter's last few years of this preciousness, but the last of mine too.  \n \nI vowed to have more patience. I promised to enjoy those things that she needs help with, like getting in and out of the Jeep, or putting on her bike helmet. I thought about doubling up on the singing at night, and reading one more book, every time she asks. I decided to buy her those little boots with the matching umbrella because she would love them, and I would get to have a sweet little girl for at least one more rainy season. \n \nScanning the boxes, I smiled, thinking how big her feet are already at a size 2. \n \nThen a part of me was crushed-in, maybe forever, as I painfully realized that the boots only go up to size 1.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-za6pyC0TVUQ/UBg_f2E7nmI/AAAAAAAAJPc/H9Af5FqBYuU/s1600/2011-10-17_08-08-21_321.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/07/a-little-rain-must-fall.html", "title": "\nA Little Rain Must Fall\n"},
{"date": "10 September, 2012", "body": "\n \n \nIn the middle of the night, I heard my daughter cough in her sleep and jumped out of bed. She had only coughed once, but that's all it took for my heart to race and a cold sweat to break out.\u00a0 I rushed to open the door and fly down the hallway to her bedside, tracking in my head where my car keys, tennis shoes, and charged cell phone were. Could I call Jake's aide to come over at nearly three in the morning? Would Descartes and I both go the hospital? Should I call my parents now and let them know, so they can make plans to fly up, or should I wait for the prognosis from the hospital staff? Will we go to Stanford, or the closer, smaller hospital? What is the name of the one drug that helps a little bit in this case? How will I live without her? I cannot imagine our lives without her. Is my daughter wearing any pajamas? \n \nI put my hand on her stomach and her forehead and I gasped, or choked on bile, or something that made me stop all of the decision trees in my head. She didn't have a fever. Cool soft skin on her little tummy and an unfurrowed brow, peaceful and healthy, and breathing quietly. Sleeping, without pajamas, through all of my worst nightmares. \n \n Chances are slim that we were really exposed when we  stayed one night at Curry Village  while Jake was at his own camp. I know that the virus is very rare, but we are still in the window where we need to keep an eye on ourselves. Once it gets to the lungs the prognosis is not good, but for the night we were all still symptom free. Nope. No hantavirus tonight.  \n \nJust try to go back to sleep after that. \n \nAnd as I lay there in bed trying to will myself to rest,\u00a0 I sadly realized that I am always preparing for the worst. How much of my brain, I wondered, is spent doing all of that thinking behind my everyday thoughts, like an operating system that is taking up too much memory doing background tasks that don't seem to help my speed or accuracy in other parts of my life. \n \nDoes it make me a pessimist that I expected to find her in need of emergency attention? Does it make me pragmatic? Cynical? \n \nI am filled with hope for my family, for my children, and our future, and I fully expect that we have so many bright, bright days ahead of us, but I am always equally preparing for every single bad thing to befall us. And perhaps that's what made me sad as I failed over and over to clear my mind; I think there are equal parts expecting joy and disaster... they are equal. \n \n What is life like for people who are not on guard all the time? And was I always this way, or is this one of the 'skills' that I have picked up because without it we would already have lost Jake to an open gate or a knife in the sink or a car door left without the child lock on? \n \nJake is gaining new abilities every day lately. He is happy and engaged and laughing more. And he can now twist open a door knob almost every time he tries. He can even twist the knob and pull the door towards him, step out of the way, and then slip himself through the open door. It is exciting, and knowing that he is that much closer to more independence makes me proud, relieved, and grateful that in an emergency he might be able to exit a building safely. \n \nAnd, it just added a need for increased vigilance for me. \n \nThat's the crux of it. Parenting is like that, with any child. We can't wait for those little babies to crawl, and the minute they do the floor needs to be clear of Legos, and marbles, and dog food, and maybe should be cleaned, but not with harsh chemicals. Their first steps and we install gates and put away glassware, and store the marble coffee table in the garage for a few years.\u00a0  \n \nIf we had experienced typical development at our house, perhaps I would have calmly proceeded from one level to the next, then relaxed as new dangers appear, and previous ones become less problematic. But that's not how it rolled out at our house. Jake has always grown in bursts of knowledge and ability. He didn't crawl until he was five or six, but his first steps at age four came not one at a time.. instead he walked across the entire living room as if he had done it every day for years. He went from needing to be lifted into the car to scampering up on his own, seemingly overnight.  \n \nI am ever hopeful that he will learn the next thing that changes his life. We work to help him gain any skill he wants to develop, but I never know if today will be the day he masters the task. There is no practicing, it always seems that a switch is clicked on, and if I am not prepared for every skill to show up, every day, the consequences are grave. So each day I am equally filled with hope, and a bit of excitement waiting to see what he will be able to do next, and I am fearful that I will not have adequately prepared his environment to keep him safe. \n \nI wish I could just revel a bit more, and worry a bit less. I want to believe my husband when he reminds me that we were not anywhere near the tent cabins those other people stayed in. I want my children's growth to be celebrated without a new list of concerns popping up in my head.  \n \nI'm going to try to tip the scale a little bit more to the 'expect joy' side, and clean out the part of my brain that is on guard all the time. I know I won't be able to let it all go, and I wouldn't want to, but perhaps I will take the advice I always give others: \n \nIt will all be okay, or it won't. And worrying about it won't change a thing.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FuGpqt96_iQ/UE4bMqT4NFI/AAAAAAAAKkI/EMfdweFZ07I/s1600/2833B171-9897-40A0-AB0B-396F7A934BF2.JPG", "http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Hundreds-of-Yosemite-Visitors-Warned-of-Hanta-Virus-167712295.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IPe1_q6BRGQ/UE4a2_3SojI/AAAAAAAAKkA/ilSzCGmsw64/s1600/C839EC03-0079-47F0-BAF0-36BFB1B88C4F.JPG"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/09/chances-are.html", "title": "\nChances Are \n"},

It' not so surprising that I might be traveling, because our little family has done all sorts of great travel, but I'm here by myself. Well, not by myself, but without my husband and my children. \n \n I miss them. It's hard not to because I have a funny husband, and cool kids who make me laugh a lot. We get along, for the most part, about most things, and we have a great time together. Just last weekend, for Father's day we took off up the coast and visited the Point Reyes National Seashore, adding another National Park to their list. We had the top off the Jeep and the music booming and there was singing and laughing and oysters and there was fog and sunshine, and a good time was had by all. \n \nI'm also having a very lovely, and I might even say, a relaxing time being responsible only for myself for a few days. Of course I'm looking out for my  girlfriends , because that's what you do when you travel with other people, but when it comes right down to it, I'm just me on this trip.  \n \nStories slip out of my mouth reminding people that I have other roles, wife, mother, daughter, sister, but those people aren't with me, so no one walking by has any idea that my daughter is over 4 feet tall, and my son often uses a wheelchair, that my husband can build anything with those gigantic meat-hook hands. I'm just a blonde lady, who apparently almost looks my own age, when I have had enough sleep. \n \n \n \nI've decided it's good for me to get away from my \"every day\" sometimes. I don't think I need to go to Land's End every time to get that same feeling, but I think it's hard to gain perspective when you are just so close all the time. Being a little more disconnected from teh interwebz hasn't hurt me either. Not reading what virtual strangers think about me has been a nice break, even if some of their ruminations show me in a kind light. \n \n \n \n \n \nSo I am off for a day of adventure with some wonderful, fun, compassionate women. Later I'll have some fruity drinks and watch the sunset, and before I know it I will be back to 'real life.' But for today, this is my real life, and I'm really happy. \n \n \n************ \n Thank you, precious husband,\u00a0 for holding down the fort, and coordinating all of the people of our awesome village who are helping us care for our kids while I am gone.

{"date": "24 October, 2012", "body": "\n \nMy dry cleaner retired. \n \nI walked in last week, and felt like someone was \" gaslighting \" me, because instead of the usual cheerful couple behind the counter, there was an entirely different cheerful couple that is about the same age. And yet there they were doing the same things that My Dry Cleaner and his wife used to do; she working elegantly at the sewing machine, and the gentleman leaping from behind the racks and hangers to greet me and take my dirty things.  \n \nI stood agape. Like I was in a bad sitcom, I actually shook my head in disbelief.\u00a0 Then I tried not to cry as the new proprietor told me again that the previous owners had retired. They were gone. And they had been gone for several weeks, which I believed, because I turned in enough shirts that I clearly had not been there since last month. \n \nI paid for my cleaning, and picked up my slip for the clothes I left behind. They have a new machine that just spits out a receipt after he types in how many items I have. No more asking for my phone number, no more handwritten notes on the flimsy little triplicate pages-which I always lost before I could use them to get my clothes out of hock.  \n \nBack in my car, I\u00a0 laid my head on the steering wheel and unraveled. I cried such big tears that I heaved and got that little shudder the way crying children do when they feel lost, and alone. And maybe that's because that's how I felt, lost and alone. \n \nI had no idea that my simple exchanges with my dry cleaner were so woven into my life. He and his wife had become a touchstone, a grounding point. He always asked how my children were doing, and called my Jenny, when no one else does. He asked about our travel plans for holidays, and remembered where we had been.  He bought me coffee once , on a day when the world seemed impossibly sad. He asked about my marriage, my family. He provided counsel and humor, and kindness.  \n \nHe is a good man, and I will miss having him on my team. \n \nWe never know who our allies will be, who will be the people we can count on to listen, or care, or pitch in. One would think that those people who were your friends in college, or maybe the exuberant couples who stood with you at your wedding, maybe they would be be your closest, and most relied upon friends. But some of those relationships fade, or are pulled apart by distance. Even family can't be there at every turn.  \n \nAnd so some friendships come when we don't expect them, people step in as sort of heroes in their own way. A motherly neighbor might be the one who comes to sit on your couch in the middle of the night to watch over of your special needs kid, while you head to the hospital to deliver your second child. It's possible that the wonderful waitress at the corner burger joint, will offer to hold that brand new baby as you struggle into the small bathroom with your other child, the one who has developed a severe sensory aversion to public restrooms and all of their echoiness. And you will accept her help with a dawning revelation that you will never again have enough hands to manage the task of parenting your children alone. \n \nIn your weariness you may encounter a small oasis. The woman at the Mediterranean cafe will recognize your tired voice when you call to place an order, and when she sees you pull in to the full parking lot she'll step out the door and bring your food to your window. She'll peer in sweetly at your precious children, and you will thank God that this woman understood how long it would take, and how hard it would be, to safely get your children in and out of the car on that busy street. She will put in an extra piece of baklava for you. \n \nYour dry cleaner will buy you coffee. \n \nIf I am lucky, I will continue to find these people as we venture on, and they will fill in, mending the holes in the fabric that make up our life. I will rely on them without knowing it at the time. \n \nI can only hope that I have been gracious enough, thankful enough in the moment, that they do not regret their kindnesses, because I will always be grateful.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/10/a-cup-of-kindness.html", "title": "\nA Cup of Kindness\n"},
{"date": "09 November, 2012", "body": "\nI have come to believe that I perhaps I live a life of luxury, if for no other reason than the fact that I no longer iron my husband's shirts, or mine very often any more. We take them to the cleaners. That one thing makes our life so much simpler, removes the hazard of falling irons on little children, and adds hours and hours to my weeks. I am a lucky woman.  \n \nBut there is something to ironing a shirt. The precision, the care, the time it takes. makes me focus for just a little bit on nothing, and everything all at once. I pulled out the board this morning, heated up the iron, adding water to make steam puff about me as I lay the shirt across the smooth pad. I thought I would just hit the collar, maybe the front placket with a small amount of care, and I could be on my way. \n \nThen I saw that the yoke was a little funky, so I ironed the collar, back then front, and tugged the yoke around the tip of the board first one shoulder then the next. As I was flipping the shirt, attempting to go straight for that front button placket I saw that the sleeves really didn't look very smooth at all, especially where they met with the now ironed yoke, so then I did the sleeve, and the other, and by the time I finished those sleeves, I had decided to just finish the entire shirt. It is now pressed and hanging in my closet. After all that I wore something else today. \n Some people will never iron. They will pay someone else to do it, they will wear different kinds of shirts, their parents will iron their shirts for them, they will wear a uniform that comes ironed from their employer. Or they will live somewhere or have a trade that means that ironing will never occur to some people at all. \n \nAs much as ironing a shirt appears to have a begininning, a middle and an end, there's really always some little piece that can be touched up, or something that gets wrinkled as you unwrinkle another part of it. It is a battle where no one wins or loses, truly, but at some point you must just tell yourself to stop, and be done with it. There is a brief period of satisfaction after it has been ironed, but before it is worn, when the shirt hangs there, on the curtain rod or the back of the door, or off the ironing board itself, when it looks like everything is 'set.' It feel like preparations have been made, and the weapons for battle have been assembled. There is a confidence standing there in front of the shirt that you have completed something, at least this one time, completed the task, and you are now fully prepared for whatever comes next. \n \nOf course the whole point of ironing the shirt is to have it look good on the person who is wearing it. But no matter how crisp the shirt, how perfectly creased the lines from shoulder to cuff, you cannot change the person who wears it. No amount of starch can build a backbone, or infuse a trodden mind with fortitude, even as it might be able to hide your indifference, because an ironed shirt does somehow say that you tried, that you care, just a little. \n \nThe irony in ironing a shirt at all, is that no matter how perfect it looks, how well it drapes across the shoulders and smoothly lays down the front of our chest, the minute you go back to \"life\" with its demands to sit, or stand, or wear a jacket, or get in a car, or hold a baby, or comfort a friend with an arm about their shoulder, or give a kid a deep, deep pressure hug so they feel safe and grounded... life will make that shirt wrinkly as if it had never been ironed, never been slaved over for some number of minutes to make it look just right. All of your work will immediately be undone and though you did what you needed to do, you will not be able to make the shirt look as smooth and unhindered as it was just hours before. \n \nAt the end of the day, the ironed shirt, with all of the ways it was used as you went through the paces of your life, the shirt will just be tossed right there into the laundry basket, along with undershirts and underwear, and dirty socks, and pillowcases. There will be no distinction for the shirt just because it looked better than the other garments at some point of the day. No special place of honor just because it started out with special treatment. When it comes down to it, it will be dirty at the end just like all the rest. \n \nAnd then it will be waiting to be washed and worn another day. Any time you want to start all over again. \n \n \n \n*** \n \n \"I Stand Here Ironing\"  is a short story by  Tillie Olsen .

Cynical, pragmatic, we've been though those months, but it is with great anticipation that I watch our life unfold before us. Even as we have watched relationships around us sour, or dissolve, or break apart in rocky crumbles, there has always been something that we have... we like each other. \n \nI like you, and your humor, and your clickety-fast mind, and your strong hands. I love you as my husband, and treasure you as a father to our children, who have your same twinkly eyes.  \n \nThank you for another year together. I would choose you again, and again. \n \nI choose you now. I love you.

{"date": "19 March, 2013", "body": "\nEvery once in a while it feels like our life is filled with VERY BIG things, and nothing small at all. \n \nI\n expect small problems all the time. This world is not set up for people\n who are outside the norm, and we have disability, precociousness, and \nwe are all way above the average height, just to name a few ways we're \ndifferent. So I expect that we will have trouble finding a parking place\n that doesn't endanger anyone, and need to load a wheelchair in and out \nof a car, adding ten minutes to any \"quick trip.\" I expect that I will \nneed to explain a grown-up concept to my always-curious daughter who \nunderstands just enough of something so as to require more information. I\n assume I will need to scope out a restaurant before we commit to going \nin., and if we're at home I might need to spend 8 minutes adjusting the \nchair my son sits in to eat. It seems I regularly need to spend some \ntime in conversation with my daughter covering the topics of equity, \nfairness, ability, and picking up after yourself. Little things. \n \nBut right now, it's all so big. So here's one big thing: \n \nI\n need to buy a new car. Not \"I want to\", or we are \"thinking about it\", I\n must buy a new car because my always reliable  Toyota Sienna minivan  had\n \" sudden unintended acceleration \" (SUA) a few weeks ago. While I was able to keep the\n car under control, and did not injure anyone, I can't ever trust that \nthe car will be safe enough for me to carry my babies in it again. What \nif we had been on  Echo Pass ? or on the tiny switchback-turny road,  Old Priest's Grade ? I needed a full left turn lane, about five car lengths, \nto realize what was happening, get it into neutral** and apply the brakes.\n Maybe I stopped in four car lengths, but regardless, on a mountain pass \nyou just don't get four car lengths to get your car under control. And \nwhat if I hadn't been driving? Jake's aide already told me she wouldn't \nhave known to put it into neutral. If I had not gained control I would \nhave hit the center divide and a light post on the opposite side of the \nintersection, or God forbid another family in a car.  \n \nToyota\n cannot duplicate the problem with my car, and they have let me know \nseveral times that it was most likely \"floor mat entrapment\"(meaning \nthat my floormat got caught under the pedal and kept the accelerator \ndepressed). Lord knows I would be thrilled if that had been the problem,\n because then I would just take out the damn floor mats and continue driving \nthe car that we just spent $4000\u00a0 to repair (because we, very responsibly, had decided to drive the car for 4-5 \nmore years since we own it, and it still has a perfectly good engine).\u00a0 \nBut I know it was not the floor mats. I've had that happen to me in \nanother car, and the feeling in the Sienna, when it began to accelerate \nwithout me pushing down in the pedal...this was a completely different \nfeeling, a terrifying, out-of-control feeling.\u00a0 And now that I know what\n it feels like, I can recall, very specifically it happening two other \ntimes. (All three times I was on a flat road, moving from right to left,\n accelerating by 10-15 miles per hour, with my turn signal on, and the \ntemperature outside was in the mid-seventies. Does that help your \nengineers Toyota?) One of those other times I called my husband right \nafter it happened, and told him what I thought had occurred. When I was on \nthe freeway, accelerating a little bit more than I wanted to, it was \nless noticable than on a city street. It calmed down and went about driving normally. Those \nother times I let it go and called it a fluke. \n \nBut here's the \nthing, after I got the car to stop safely, this last time, I tried to \nrestart the car. In my hyper-alert state of mind, I decided to \nget the car out of traffic so I would not cause any accidents. Of course\n that is a crazy idea to drive the car right away, but that's what I was\n thinking I should do. So I restarted it. Twice. And both times, without\n my foot on the accelerator, the engine red-lined to about 7000 rpm. \nBoth. Times. That means that the car was still in an \"unintended \nacceleration\" state, just not in drive. That's when I got out of the \ncar, took the keys out, and stood outside of what once had been the car I\n used to shuttle my children, haul groceries, and road trip with\n every weekend. My car went from being a reliable part of the family to \nbeing a 2 ton pile of angry metal, bent on self-destruction, and happy \nto take me on a ride with it.  \n \nAnd so, I will not go \ninto all of the detail of how poorly Toyota has communicated with us, \nhow not-helpful they were, how I had to actually pay for the rental car I\n used while my car sat around their lot waiting for a Toyota exec to \ncome out and look at the \"customer-stated issue\" Since they couldn't \nduplicate the problem in all of the 11 miles they drove the car, they \nhave declared my car as having \"no issues.\" Which is fine for them, but \ncompletely not fine for me, or my family. \n \nSo I'm not \njust thinking about buying a car, I need to get a different car, right \nnow because we still have all of those things to do that we always need \nto do, like get to school, and to the store, and to the doctor's \noffice.. And now I need to figure out all of the things we need to \nconsider in a new car, and buy one on a compressed time schedule. We \nchose that Toyota on purpose, because it fit Jake's wheelchair \nacross the back, has all wheel drive, has a low threshold to get in, \nenough leg room for our leggy family, room for seven passengers, a roof \nrack, and sliding side doors that slid at the press of a button. \n \nGuess\n how many other cars have those features? None. No other car in the US \nmarket has those features. Toyota makes that car. It's the Sienna, and \nhad they handled the situation differently, I might feel like they cared\n about my family. If they said, \"Let us take that car right now for full\n blue-book, here is a new one with zero-percent financing, and we have \nno known issues at all with the new Siennas.\" You know,\u00a0 I probably \nwould have considered it as my first choice. I had enough confidence in that company that I would have considered a \nnewer Toyota right then if someone had just pretended that my family mattered. \n \nMy\n first ride, as an infant, was a Toyota Corona which was so new to America\n that I hear it had bad translations on some of the buttons in the car. I took \nmy driver's ed course using my Toyota Corolla LE, and that little blue car took my\n Momster to graduate school, and my sister through her first years of \ndriving. I've owned an FJ-60 and a newer LandCruiser. Basically I've been \ndriving Toyotas for twenty-five years, and because I am just that \nnostalgic, I am sad. But mostly I am so angry with Toyota Motor Corp for not\n recognizing what their neglect has done to ruin their brand in my mind.\n I really wanted someone to care, a little, about the person who has \nheld title on four of their cars over the course of more than half my \nlife.  \n \nWhat kind of company takes a week to check \non your possessed car, then makes you pay for the car rental? What kind \nof company says \"nothing is wrong\" with my car, then calls a \ncouple of weeks later and offers to buy our floormats so their \n\"engineers can work with them.\" (Even though I have explained clearly \nthat their was no floor mat entrapment.)  \n \nSo now buying a car is more than just a \"whoo hoo I have a great life and I get a new car!\" It's\nall wrapped up in me feeling safe again, and ensuring that my kid with \ndisabilities can be comfortable in the car, and figuring it all out quickly.\n Changing brands after this many years is harder than I thought it would\n be, but I think we have decided on....a Ford Flex. In fact, it may look a lot like the one below.  \n \n \n \n \nFord has been awesome on  Twitter \n answering questions, offering to set up test drives searching for \ncars. It's not an expense we planned\n on, but if everything works out it will be a great thing for \nour family. \n \nSo long Toyota.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 **In a n  SUA situation, in newer cars, pressing your engine on/off button may work but you will probably lose power steering and brake assist, making the car difficult to handle. I n  older cars,  t urning the ignition off at the key has the potential to lock the steering, and is not generally recommended. I stomped my foot on the brake  to the floor,  put it in neutral and continued to slow the car. The car made a very terrible sound engine against breaks, and worse in neutral and park with the engine   roaring at redline. Here is an  Edmunds. com video that discusses what to do in the case of a stuck open throttle. \n People who drive a stick would probably naturally put in the clutch and put the car in neutral.\u00a0 I am very thankful that I knew what to do, and I specifically want to thank my Dad, Jack T., and Jennifer and Greg for insisting that I learn how to drive a manual transmission car. I know I was a terrible student, but obviously you were very good teachers. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/vehicle_gallery/all/#/sienna/gallery/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_unintended_acceleration", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_Summit", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moccasin,_Tuolumne_County,_California#Priest_Grade_and_Old_Priest_Grade", "http://images.cobaltgroup.com/9/8/5/6094354589x400.jpg", "https://twitter.com/FordService", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFm047FUifQ"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2013/03/when-everything-is-just-so-big.html", "title": "\nWhen Everything is Just So Big\n"},
{"date": "21 October, 2011", "body": "\n It's been a rough back to school for Jake. Going from playing outside all day with very few demands back in to class is hard on most kids, but there were also\u00a0staff changes in his classroom in September, and lots of changes with aides at home. Not to mention a growth spurt and a migraine thrown in for a few days. Sadly, he has begun hitting himself on the leg repeatedly, enough to cause a little bruising. It kills me that we can't figure out some ways to soothe him out of the stim, but he's doing it when he is seemingly happy as well, so we've added it to the wonder and mystery that is our son.\u00a0 \n \n It's possible there has just been too much going on. Jake had his trienniel IEP, along with all of the psychological and\u00a0developmental\u00a0testing that goes along with measuring the minutia of a child with so many services. His teachers came to the house for a visit, which was lovely actually, something I wish every school-aged child could have at least once. After the home visit his teachers now have a frame of reference for all of the things we talk about, which I think is helpful since Jake is basically non-verbal. And the actual IEP went very well because those educators, staff directors, and the psychologist -- the OT, and the adaptive PE guy, and the speech pathologist, and all of the support staff, they all really care about my kid. I think they even like him.\u00a0 \n \n Then his Regional Center social worker came for her annual appointment, where we went over his IPP. That's his\u00a0 Person-centered\u00a0 individual program planning . Sort of a life-map plan for Jake, so that he can continue to get the services he needs from the state. This meeting also determines the number of respite hours we receive from the county. There are a lot of forms. This year there were some tears. The goals didn't change much from last year, and while I know Jake has grown and changed, the paperwork just won't ever tell that story very well.\u00a0 \n \nThere was also a meeting with his IHSS social worker.  In Home Support Services \u00a0are monies that \u00a0\"help pay for services provided to you so that you can remain safely in your own home.\" His disabilities are measured from top to bottom, and his entire day is accounted for. We speak of his needs in quarter hour increments, and calculate, how much time does toileting take? cutting up his food? And does he still need help getting dressed? Can he get into the car by himself? Can he brush his own teeth?\u00a0 \n \nAnd lastly a visit with the doctor at CCS, California Children's Services, which addresses the cerebral palsy part of my child, as if we can just divy up his mind like that. We talk about wheelchairs and shoe inserts and medications, and how much he's grown. We talk about puberty. Puberty! The meeting takes place in the same room we've been going to for nine years, or is it ten? So we are half way through the services there; CCS stops providing services at age 22. Half-way through his childhood? already? \n \n We are very blessed with kind social workers who really feel like advocates for our family, and a school district that truly honors IDEA, and a school that loves my child and wants to help him to become a productive adult. We have all, or at least most of the services in place that we need, and I can manage to paperwork and the running around that is required of each service because I can work from home. \n \n But every time we have these meetings in a row, and they are always in a row, right around Jake's birthday, I am exhausted. Of course each meeting requires preparation on my part, but it's not that part that is so tiring. It's talking, for hours on end, about all of my son's deficits. It drains me. completely. \n \n and when I'm that drained I'm sure Jake gets frustrated because I'm probably not \"hearing\" Jake as well as I normally do; much of his communication is subtle. At least twice during these meetings I had to speak about him, in front of him, which makes me feel awful, and it can't be that great for him. I normally speak without him nearby, or I remember to tell him who is coming and the things I will need to share with that person about his abilities, but I forget sometimes, and no matter how carefully I word things he might hear, it can't be that great to hear a list of all of the things you aren't good at. I'm certain that would make me more than a little agitated. \n \n But we are done for awhile, so I can only hope that as I catch my breath and pull everything back together, Jake will do the same.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dds.ca.gov/RC/RCipp.cfm", "http://www.dss.cahwnet.gov/cdssweb/PG139.htm"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/10/take-deep-breath.html", "title": "\nTake a Deep Breath\n"},
{"date": "14 February, 2011", "body": "\nSixteen years ago today, that guy, who is now my husband, gave me a little wooden box with four little pots. Each pot had a little primrose in it. \n \nHe was dating my roommate, and brought her a beautiful bouquet of flowers, and his handsome smile and his invitation to dinner, but somehow in the midst of being a great boyfriend, he remembered me, the lonely roommate who, I think had just stopped dating the guy who would eventually be the best man at our wedding. Life was so simple then. \n \nIt was a very sweet of him. So sweet that after they left, I randomly, plucked three flowers from the plants and pressed them into the largest book I had at the time, \"The Riverside Shakespeare,\" which is a ginormous book of works. \n \n I had never pressed a flower in my life, and for some reason, I plucked those flowers and pressed them in the middle of  Antony and Cleopatra  which is sort of a strange love story. It's too bad I didn't choose  Taming of the Shrew , or  Romeo and Juliet  because it might make the story better, but our story's not bad. I've never pressed a flower since that night.  \n \n I've wondered many times why I chose to save that memory. I thought he was a nice guy, and even at 25 it was obvious that he was a good guy-that he would be \"grow up\" to be a good man, and as it turns out, a great father as well. Did I know, even then, that we'd be here, nearly 13 years of marriage later?  \nWhat is it that makes us stick? What makes any marriage stay together? Perhaps it's facing adversity together and coming out on the other side-not that we're done facing challenges, Lucy is only 4! And I know we're still figuring out how to support each other, because what I need to \"feel okay\" is different than what my husband needs.\u00a0 I've recognized that it might be unreasonable to expect my spouse to be  my everything , which is why I cherish my relationships with my sister, my moms, my girlfriends, and my online community. My husband and I laugh a lot; we share a dark humor. We have a few secrets together, which may be surprising to some because I do tend to share quite a bit. Maybe this is something: I really like my husband. If we weren't married I would still want to know him, hang out with him, and probably still choose him as someone on my island (do you ever play that game?). He's very smart, and says nice things about me to other people, and we parent the same way without really trying. We have finally figured out that date night is a very smart thing to do on a very regular basis, and without much complaint, he eats everything I cook even if it's terrible.  and  he's handsome. I am a very lucky woman. \n \n Happy Valentine's Day sweet man. \n \n and thank you again to my roommate for finding such a great guy; I can never thank you enough.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Qrg7T_qspIU/TVmJ-kX3GXI/AAAAAAAACuQ/YBl09zQ_lKU/s1600/IMG_20110214_094303.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_and_Cleopatra", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_juliet"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/02/prim-rose-by-any-other-name-would-smell.html", "title": "\nA (prim) Rose by any Other Name Would Smell as Sweet\n"},
{"date": "12 August, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nI went to BlogHer11 last week. I road-tripped with one of my bestest friends AND her mom AND her girls, and managed to be packed and ready to go at 5am. We slid past the San Luis reservoir at daybreak, and in record time were able to gobble delicious Mexican food in Southern California. I even managed to sneak a quick visit in with  my Dad  over those delicious enchiladas. Another couple of hours, and\u00a0 I got to meet the cool group of people at  Oceanhouse media . If you don't have any of their apps go check them out. Road tripping with someone who has a plan is an awesome thing. We were efficient, on time, and uhm, she drove the whole way to our destination. My stay in San Diego/La Jolla was lovely of course. Our hostess has created a welcoming, easy-to-slip-into type of place--she even has homemade jam; it is a tough place to leave (and I thank you again for having us.) \n \n \n \nI had the  best bunk mate ever . We talked, and talked, and talked, and then she told me a story about the axle on her car? Maybe, and I fell asleep. Sorry I'm so rude. Sorry I \"snore lightly.\" But mostly I'm really sorry that we don't live closer, because She made me laugh so hard that other people couldn't even type. That tweet by  Liz Ditz  above should say \"laughed so hard she couldn't talk for 5 minutes\", but it's also likely that SJ could make me laugh hard enough to get knifed five times too. It's not often I get to have that many uninterrupted conversations with someone so smart and sassy who also has such a depth of character.\u00a0 She even convinced me to do a little cooking demonstration thing with Knorr with Marco Pierre White. It was fun, Chef White was very gracious, and I got some cool free samples of Knorr stock and a signed book, and an apron which I actually really needed. And Chef White did not shame me when I basically needed a half cup more of parmesean on my risotto. I really love risotto, especially with parm and asparagus, and cooking with friends is one of my favorite things.  \n \n  I danced at the evening parties. I even fell on the dance floor like I did at that wedding when\n my brother threw me across the wood in a reckless Tango move.. but this\n time I was the designated driver, so it had more to do with my tiny \nheels and my amazing dance partner  Jen Lee Reeves , of  BornJustRight . Who also made me laugh quite a bit, now that I think about it.  \n \n And of course there was that great  Special Needs mini-con  on Friday. I was honored to help the unstoppable   Julia Roberts  (not that one) from  SupportforSpecialNeeds.com . I didn't do much, but  she  did a fantastic job setting everything up, \nand the 80 or so people that came were some of the vibrant, deep-thought, hilarious bloggers I know online. The speakers on the panel were  Shannon Rosa ,  Auriela Cotta  and Robert Rummel-Hudson. I think I can call  Robert Rummel-Hudson  a friend now, and not just because I brought him little tiny ice cream bars at one of the breaks, but because we share the same passion for wanting to come together as a group, united as parents of special needs kids, in our desire for positive change, and take on those completely uncomplicated things like health care and insurance reform.  \n \nBlogHer is one of those magic places that helps blur the lines between IRL (in real life) and online\u00a0 friends, and that's a good thing, because as we get more wired in, with Google+ and Twitter and Facebook, it's hard to say I'm not \"close\" with someone just because I can't meet them at our Thursday morning coffee. As I sat next to  Laura Shumaker  at the mini-con, and later at dinner, I realized how lucky I am that I can probably hang out with her as much as our schedules allow (and we are totally going to do that as soon as my children get their buns back in school), but with BlogHer, and the whole interwebs thing, parents of special needs kids don't have to feel so isolated anymore, and anyone can hear all of the wise things Laura has to say just by visiting a  website . \n \nThings might get sort of tough sometimes, but we can find each other in the middle of the night online. On those late nights when we think that we are the only person with a ten  year old who is wandering the house checking for ways to get outside, it's nice to know I have friends on another coast who can offer advice or support.

{"date": "06 July, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n check. double-check \n \n We don't ever really relax. We think we do. We get babysitters and go out for drinks with friends. We take turns keeping an eye on Jake, but really there are only five days a year I do not worry about my son: the 'week' he goes to  camp . Other than that, my mind, and quite often my body,\u00a0 is on duty twenty-four hour a day. Part of that responsibility is just what it feels like to be a parent, but I've seen other parents with typical kids, and I see how they can let go of their child's hand in the store, leave the car door or window unlocked, leave the back gate without double-checking the double-lock. They can expect that their child is not going to shimmy through the dog door, and just about disappear in silence.  \n \nBut there are places that are easier than others. Places where I can let my guard down a little bit, because I either have the safety in numbers of responsible adults, or a well-enclosed space, or just one other person who completely gets my kid, and can recognize things that will be dangerous even if they look safe for another special needs kid.  \n \nOur house is one of those places, and thankfully we own our home and can make improvements and adjustments to the walls, and fences without asking any one's permission. Our home is safe, but not without some very serious rules, and a lot of attention to detail. If you come to a closed door or gate in my house...there's a reason, and it's probably not because I don't want you to see me naked. If you make a mistake and leave even one gate or door open, there could be consequences that range from, dirty shoes on the bed (so don't care), to a child covered in dog poop (completely annoying), to a boy who has wandered past the driveway (very worrisome, and I can guarantee that I will cry when we find him), and of course, there's death, because we really can't be sure of Jake's safety awareness, and it's not like he is just going to come back on his own, unless  he decides  to return through that open gate. Lucy just turned five, but after a pre-teen visitor to the house left the back gate open, I told her that no matter who comes in behind her, even if it is a grown up, it was her responsibility to make sure the gate is locked  after any time she passes through it . She gets it, and has done it without complaint, but the amount of responsibility we must place on her is nearly unbearable to me. \n \n \n \n Mt. Tallac at sunset.  \n Tahoe is a safe place for Jake. My sister and her husband, and their children all look out for him, know his abilities, and know when he is not okay by the tone of his vocalizations. The backyard is large and gated and filled with toys and tan bark and a trampoline where the little kids entertain him with their bouncing, twirling and bickering. I know that Jake cannot escape from the backyard, so when Demanda and Jaster clean up the entire place for Jake (thank you thank you thank you), all we need to do is periodic checking for dog poop, which you would do for any bunch of kids playing. With everything taken care of, we can sit on the upper deck, all four children within our view. With nice weather and a frosty beverage this almost looks like relaxing. \n \nAnd even luckier, I have a few friends who either have Jake-safe homes all the time, or who care about his safety enough to change things while we are there. One family has cleaned up a dirt area and put in palm-sized rocks for Jake to tumble, and ensures that the pool gate is locked at all times, and another has a big front yard that is fenced and filled with dogs and kids who will not let him go out the front gate. We have still more friends who try, in every way, to make their houses a place where we can bring our entire family, by checking gates and keeping the front door closed, even when it's an Open House.  \n \nBut as much as I really do not want my child to be injured, there is another part of him being safe in our home, in our extended-families' homes, and our friends' homes which may be even more important; it's acceptance. Acceptance cannot be nailed into a wall, or double-locked. Creating an environment of acceptance is not as easy as just sweeping up. \n \nAcceptance is knowing that my son might trample your new grass, or steal the top soil out of your planter, and inviting him to play nearby them anyway. It's not really keeping track of the number of little things he's swiped off your counter, and hidden or broken. And not being too bothered by the copious amount of food that always seem to be at my child's feet. It's inviting a child, my child, with 'toileting issues' to come swimming anyway. It's believing my son has something to say. And it's forgiving me when I can't clean up our debris and dishes because we \"have to go RIGHT NOW.\" \n \nIt's inviting us over at all. \n \nAnd it's inviting us back. \n \nI am thankful. \n \n \n \n ****  a version of this post was an editor's pick today at  OpenSalon.com \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-il4uJuTvtAI/ThPUmmJ7ONI/AAAAAAAACxw/-ifvlwoal4c/s1600/2011-07-05_19-15-53_340.jpg", "http://www.viaservices.org/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-91ieYGAitPw/ThPE4GlG3ZI/AAAAAAAACxg/fEo-jjvVOrU/s1600/2011-07-03_20-29-33_84.jpg", "http://open.salon.com/blog/jennyalice/2011/07/06/is_the_gate_locked#"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/07/is-gate-locked.html", "title": "\nIs the Gate Locked?\n"},

{"date": "01 July, 2010", "body": "\n \n \n a girl and her dog \n We are a lucky family. There's really no other way to see it, at least when it comes to dogs. \n \nWhen I first met my husband he had two dogs, Buddy and Shadow. Buddy, a golden retriever was sweet and was a snuggler, always wanting to put his snout under your hand to encourage you to pet him. Shadow was a border collie, and a princess. She was in charge, and one of the smartest gals I have ever met. \n \nI remember going to Descartes' boat, where he lived, and walking the dogs for him when he got stuck late at work. It was the most frightening thing to take those two beloved animals out to the field, and let them run without their leashes. It wasn't scary because they were in danger, it was a safe place where dogs were allowed off leash. No, it was scary because I knew that if anything had happened to those dogs, my relationship would be over. The dogs were in his life before I was, and I knew that if push came to shove, at least at the time, I was fairly certain they would win. \n \nBuddy and Shadow were our first kids. We cared for them together in our new marriage. I cried when I dropped them off at the kennel for our three and a half week honeymoon. Their presence in our life dictated where we lived (not San Francisco, because in 1999 rents were sky high and no one had to take a couple with dogs, no matter what their income or credit report scores.) I think we actually live on the peninsula because of those dogs...we just kept heading south until we found a decent city that would let us rent with animals, and when it came time to by a home we started with the familiar, which was this neighboring city. \n \nBuddy and Shadow were Jake's first dogs. They loved him, and never flinched as his hands clutched fur, his variable grasp not ever knowing how hard or softly to hold things. They made him laugh. When Buddy got liver cancer we were devastated. We went through several surgeries, each one getting us a few more weeks with him. He passed away at home on the cool of the tile in the hallway when Jake was one. \n \nShadow moved back on to the foot of the bed, and reigned supreme at our house. We fed her steak and rice with  melted  cheese. I pulled ticks off of that dog, and she loved my little boy.\u00a0 Shadow lived until March 20, 2003. I remember the day because or entire house had fallen apart slowly; first a horrible stomach virus swept through, then we had a broken microwave, a broken rice cooker, and a broken computer, then the tub backed up into the sink, the sink drained into the wall, flooding our downstairs, war broke out in Iraq, and then the dog died.\u00a0 She just closed her eyes, sighed and died in my arms at the vet's office.  \n \nDog free, our house was cleaner, with uncomplicated travel plans, and it was quiet, and clearly we were missing something. It was difficult, but we decided to wait awhile to get any animals. Looking back, we had also decided to wait to get pregnant again. By this time it was increasingly obvious that Jack had significant disabilities. That fall he started early intervention preschool and rode the short bus for the first time. Our plans to have a second child were back-burnered for the foreseeable future while we figured out what kind of life we we were going to have. Jake had intense sleep issues, and some self-injurious behavior, and could barely walk independently, even at three. Our life felt a little bit out of control. Someone used the word \"autism\". We did genetic testing. We saw neurologists. We went to a million different agencies and doctors, and I started this blog. \n \n \n \n Lucy adoring Bilbo (with family friend V.) \n Somewhere in there we found out about  NorCal Golden Retriever Rescue . We somehow, swiftly and happily became owners of Chandler and Bilbo. They came with the names okay? Chandler Bing and Bilbo Baggins. They had not been mistreated in their previous home, just neglected a bit in a \"we have a newborn and a small dog, so we don't want anything big around our little tiny things\" way. \n \nBilbo had a snaggle tooth, Chandler had a block head. They were both a beautiful red, and friendly to all they encountered, unless you were a raccoon or a deer or a black cat in the front yard. Bilbo was a love, patiently standing nearby lest you felt the need to scratch someone's head. Chandler was happy being a pillow, a wrestling bear or when unmonitored children were nearby, a step stool.  \n \nThey were a great pair, brothers from different litters. They happily curled around each other in the back of our van and rode to Tahoe, or any other place, mostly they played with our children. They were Lucy's first dogs, and they loved her. \n \nBilbo died last summer, after several procedures to drain the fluid from around his heart. He was 9 years old. After the last big procedure we thought we would have some more time with him, but he passed away only five days later, choosing the same cool spot in the hallway that Buddy chose to spend his last hours. \n \nSo then there was Chandler. We thought about getting him a companion, but he was fine being solo. He was so easy going and friendly. He would sprawl across the living  room floor, letting Lucy use him as a pillow as she watched TV. He was a joy to travel with, and loved playing in the snow when we went to the Sierra Nevadas. Big and fluffy, the ice would stick to the bottom of his coat when he shoved his nose into piles of fresh powder. He got along with other dogs, little children, puppies, old people, everyone except the black cat and the deer in the front yard, and as he aged he would simply put his head out the dog door to bark at them. He couldn't even be bothered to push his whole body outside to tell them to go away.  \n \nHe got old fast. In a matter of weeks, he went from a little bit of a slow, chubby, dog to an old man who couldn't see to walk down the stairs at night because his cataracts were so bad. He stopped coming upstairs last week, then he stopped coming down the hall, then he just laid down in our room, at the foot of the bed. \n \n \n Chandler 2000-2010\u00a0  \n \n \nHe was a good dog. They were all good dogs. Friendly, loving, good to our children, and guests. We've been lucky, so very blessed by all the good natured doggies in our life. I keep trying to think of these furballs as 'animals' and they keep finding a way into my heart. I can't imagine our life without them \n \nLucy noted, \"We can always get a new dog, but we will always miss  Chandler.\" And we will. Thank you Chandler for being such a lovely, treasured part of our family.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TCzDNlSaiLI/AAAAAAAACdI/0qk760TZhxM/s1600/myrs48edit.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TCwZQvgZ8RI/AAAAAAAACdE/850JmDvRBkQ/s1600/DSCN0184.JPG", "http://www.golden-rescue.org/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TCvEkK6q4YI/AAAAAAAACdA/8Sc1UgOAS6w/s1600/IMG_9743.JPG"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/07/every-dog-has-his-day.html", "title": "\nEvery Dog Has His Day\n"},

{"date": "17 August, 2009", "body": "\n Summer is almost at an end. We've been busy. Summer School for Jake was awful. I'm not sure how it could have been worse. Jake did not get along with his aide, the regular teacher was out on maternity leave, school was, at the last minute set up on a different campus, the bus driver was scared of Jake, and Jake seemed to be in a permanent state of \"episode\". The last day of school I broke down in tears because the aide told me I could not take home  Jake's icon book. It was resolved, but not before I made an ass of myself emailing the director of Special Ed trying to figure out what possible reason they had to deny a kid the chance to communicate by keeping a folder filled with laminated construction paper in a box inside a locked classroom. Of course the aide somehow got it wrong and we were allowed to take it home. Lucy's Birthday(s) Lucy had I think maybe 5 birthday parties. One with grandparents, one at daycare, one with her favorite babysitters and a buddy, one with her cousins and some close family friends, then finally the last one with her friends in the backyard for a barbecue. They were each special in their own way, but in the future I have decided  that you may not have more parties than whatever half your age is (so she should have had 1.5 parties max!) *and* if you want more than 3 you must plan the rest yourself. That should hold her off until she's 10 or so I think.  I made cupcakes, I bought cakes. I bought decorations, I made decorations. At her last party, which had the theme \"Princesses and Pirates\", I was  gung -ho that I went to Michael's and spent more on craft projects than we spent on food. I spray painted little boxes which the kids decorated with sequins, foam stickers and such. We called them treasure chests. Travel We didn't go as many places as I thought we would, but we did manage to hit the Tahoe basin for every major weekend,  and for a week long trip just a few weeks ago to celebrate Descartes' 40 th  birthday. He refused to let me throw him an actual party, but luckily all of our friends are turning 40, so he still gets to celebrate everywhere he goes. All of our plans changed at the last minute due to major high winds at the campground, so we ended up back in South Lake, so he did get to have a FAB-you- lus   dinner at the  Un -Buffet. It was not  ungood  and it was not  unbad . We had fun sampling fairly decent food and spent more on cabs than we did on dinner :) Jake had another round of his favorite thing ever.. Camp.  He had a fantastic 1:1 aide for the week, and we actually sent him to the 7 night 8 day camp this year. He came home dirty and snotty and happy (The picture does not indicate much happiness, but that kid was so tired he could barely stand up). His 1:1 actually said \"It was a pleasure. We had a great time. He ate a lot, and he loved going on the nature hikes.\" He  soooo  did not need to say those things. I didn't get even an ounce of that feeling when someone is trying so very hard to come up with a nice thing to say. Family We got to spend time with all three sets of grandparents, and our Tahoe family of course. I think that our extended family has a good picture of what our life looks like these days, and each  little branch of family, in their own way, has figured out a way to support us.  It's also been wonderful to realize that our friends are becoming more and more like family. I think we are coming back out of our shell.. that hard coating we put on a few years back when we felt a little alone in the world, and a little (or a lot) burned.  Back-to-School WunderSkool  for Jake begins next week. We have a transition meeting and a bunch of paperwork, and I still have no idea about transportation times, but it will be a fresh start and every time we talk about it Jake gets this little  squinty  eye and a half smile. I have manageable  expectations, but for the first time in a long time I have a bit of hope. I think Jake may actually be heard, and possibly better communicate his own needs. My mom said she hasn't heard me this happy in a long time. I don't know if I am \"happy\", I mean I want to be, and of course I am, with many many things, but \"happy\" sounds like \"easy\" and \"simple\" and those things I do not know much of lately. I am however feeling more buoyant, and I think that looks like happy. My shoulders don't hurt so much from carrying the weight of the world (cue violins).  And  life is changing even a bit more because we made sort of an abrupt decision to enroll Lucy in preschool. She did a little interview/trial run last week, and she loved the place, and they seemed to like her too. She will also start at the end of August and she will have French and art and coloring and running about and carpooling and backpacks and the whole deal. She is so, SO excited. I am happy for her because she is ready to go, but I am sad as well because this last year was not the same kind of year Jake had at that age. When Jake was 2-3 I went to the zoo and museums and the park and the library and out to lunch and every where. Lucy got to watch videos in the car as we drove back and forth to Jake's school averting disaster. I didn't get to jump in the car with her and take her to the City for a cable car ride for fear that we would be called back, and I certainly never ventured to the Aquarium.  I cannot even count the number of miles I drove to Jake's school last year. I know Lucy will be fine. She has done enough \"fun\" things to not hate me, but *I* will remember that the last year she was ever at home..the last year she ever had without school... she was trapped in the beige  no-so-mini Van. It will sting a little less when I see her happy face after her first day of school I'm sure. and so tomorrow Lucy and I head over to her new school to purchase a few uniforms. Tomorrow I place the order for Jake's back to school pants and shirts.  and we start a whole new chapter in our little life. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/Sou7Bjzh4wI/AAAAAAAACHg/XY1HrAKFgjE/s1600-h/IMG_2382.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/Sou404QXMMI/AAAAAAAACHY/Sbtf3QidD74/s1600-h/P6062727.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/Sou3XxjKzZI/AAAAAAAACHI/_rU-3NNQ9xE/s1600-h/P8033151.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/Sou24XT44YI/AAAAAAAACHA/jdB22vVWcW8/s1600-h/P8073301.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/Sou8t2DVndI/AAAAAAAACHo/Vno1c1fUqJ4/s1600-h/P6062716.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/SovAXg7mEbI/AAAAAAAACHw/T3XHfIkehDM/s1600-h/i+win.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/08/all-over-but-uniforms.html", "title": "\nAll Over but the Uniforms\n"},

{"date": "07 April, 2010", "body": "\nI made Lucy her favorite dinner the other night...Dutch Baby. Perhaps I will put our recipe here if you really want. Basically it is a thick pancake that fluffs up when it bakes in the oven, then sinks when it emerges (like a souffle). When it's ready we slice it like a pizza and throw a bit of powdered sugar on it. She loves it and I can recognize all of the ingredients in it, so I will make it for her just about whenever she asks. \n \n It is so quick to make, and since I popped it into the toaster oven, it cooks even faster. I still set a timer to make sure I don't forget about it. If it puffs too high it will hit the top coils and burn in quite a nasty way resulting in a sad kid and a messy oven. (Image from  Instructables . I could have said it was my photo, but my oven is WAAAAAY dirtier than that!) \n \nWhen I set the timer for 12 minutes I went about my way in the kitchen, cleaned up the counter where Jake had eaten dinner, opened up some root chips and introduced 5 flavors of odd root to Lucy, put away the last groceries, and tidied the silverware\u00a0 drawer. \n \nIt looked like the pancake should come out, so I took it out, sliced it up, powdered it, set up a little tray table for Lucy who very nicely asked to eat \"on the couch under a blanket to be cozy.\" So I hooked her up and went on to line up the disaster prone plastic container nightmare in the bottom drawer next to the sink. Next I checked Tweetdeck, then went to wash my hands because they felt sticky, and as I dried off my hands...the timer beeped. \n \nI had done all of those things in 12 minutes; and those are just the things I remember.  \n \nI always think everything takes so much time, actually, it's more like I have a sense of time that is not quite like most people. I am constantly calculating all day long, how much each action will take \n \nI think unloading the dishwasher takes 15 minutes or more; it takes 7 at the most. \n \nI think it takes 11 minutes to get Lucy from our kitchen to her preschool door. If you only counted actual drive time, I'd be close, but the race to the car with the inevitable falling down or forgetting something, plus the chit chat as we get out of our car at the other end makes this task at least 20 minutes, and it's really more like 25, and by the time I say hullo/goodbye to other parents it is nearly 50 minutes before I'm back at my door. \n \nI know that it takes 3 1/2 minutes, at the most, to get to Sage's house, and it can be done faster if my son has a three inch nail in his foot and she is taking Lucy for a bit whilst we take a jaunt to the Emergency room. It takes 5 minutes to get to the closest emergency room if you drive the speed limit. \nDepending on traffic it is 9 1/2-10 1/2 minutes to get to Squid's house. but I should drive slower than I do around those corners. It is 13 minutes to get to Pollyanna's and 29 minutes, at least, to get to BQ's house. It takes  forever  to get to Orange County from this side of the bay, and Tahoe is 3 hours 35 at 4:30 am and 5 hours 50 minutes if you leave at 4:30 pm.  \n \nSomehow, it takes nearly 4 minutes to get from the back of the house to the front of the house where we put Jake on the bus. \n \nIt takes 52 minutes to get to Safeway, buy a small bunch of groceries (if there's a list), pay for the groceries and drive home. \n \nIt takes 10 seconds for my husband to set my day off right by kissing me goodbye when he leaves for work. \n \nA post for this blog may only take 10 minutes to write, but could take up to 3 months for me to decide to hit publish.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S7zgg4K1KEI/AAAAAAAACYI/1VKvH539Nws/s1600/Easy-Bake-Dutch-Baby.jpg", "http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-Bake-Dutch-Baby/"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/04/so-much-time.html", "title": "\nSo Much Time\n"},
{"date": "07 January, 2009", "body": "\nI have an extra ward this week, Lil' Miss is staying with us until her brother is feeling better, so Lucy has a playmate again. We have had a revolving door with children 3 and under so I am hoping she figures out that life is not always a sleepover. given that she is my child she may be pretty sad when the friends/cousins aren't here all the time. The girls were both precious and rotten when I took them to the Cal  Academy  today. Lucy had trouble being sympathetic to\u00a0Lil' Miss when she was having some need to control her environment by declaring things \"scary\". \u00a0\"Why are you scared of the fish when they are so beautiful?\" I was inclined to agree with Lucy, but we left just the same. The girls sat nicely art lunch and ate some fish instead... .followed by cupcakes. \u00a0I am not into denying\u00a0Lil' Miss anything this week., and if this is the hardest thign in my life right now I am truly blessed.\u00a0 Although I am having trouble writing lately. Not just because my\u00a0 house  has been filled, but because my mind is tired of  planning  things out. You know those: Big Life Things. Things like college  accounts , and major repairs and medical bills and investments and the recycling. It sort of feels a bit overwhelming to plan out 5 paragraphs in a row. I think everythign is okay, but them I wake up in the middle of the night and remember somethign else that needs to come together. Liek all of Jake's new technology...his talkers need ot go on the wall, and Jake got an  awesome  new touch screen monitor for Christmas. I just got some kiddie software that he likes (apparently)  from speech  therapy at school, so I am hoping this can be an  activity we  can do together, because his new favorite thing is not my favorite...\u00a0 lately, in addition to needing to be in the backyard  allthetimealways  even when it goes below 50 degrees.. he is standing in the corner of the yard and peering through the fence into the neighbor's yard. There isn't anyone there, and the neighbor would not mind at all if Jake was found out, but it creeps me out a bit. It is especially a good view after the sun goes down because the neighbor has those lights that are solar powered and glow blue.. so it looks like little floating blue dots in the darkness. Honestly he does go to the corner mostly after the sun goes down.. in the brief time before dinner when it's dark \u00a0but he can still sort of see. Maybe if I tell them what the lights actually are he will not be so intrigued, but when I was his age I still wanted to believe in fairies and gnomes (even though Santa was so clearly my parents), maybe I will hold off and just let him peer into the lights a bit longer.\u00a0 I still want to believe in fairies and gnomes. A little magic could do us all some good. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/01/little-troubles.html", "title": "\nlittle troubles\n"},
{"date": "27 October, 2011", "body": "\n We're sitting here on the walkway on our hill. I'm a little more relaxed up here as long as I am between Jake and the stairs which lead to the street, where he has just gotten off the bus. It's not a yellow short bus anymore, it's a very well-used white van with a sweet driver who may or may not understand anything I say. It doesn't matter to me as long as he continues to treat my boy with the respect and care he's shown each day.\u00a0 \n \n Jake's ride home from school is almost an hour, which seems like a long time, but it wouldn't be much shorter if I drove him myself. He's always been a good passenger, and it's not a bad ride through the eight or ten cities they travel. I imagine he leans his head against the window and looks at the rolling hills. Maybe he naps sometimes, but he's always loved road trips, and Descartes and I both like to drive, so perhaps it's just another way for us to know he's really our kid. \n \n I keep asking him about Halloween. I know he practiced at school today, walking to the office in preparation of going door-to-door on Monday with a decorated bag, and someone holding his hand. \u00a0I know from the journal we pass between classroom and home that he carried a push-talk button that said \"Trick-or-treat.\" I ask him if he held the button, or did his aide carry it for him. He smiles and squints his eyes. \n He just keeps laughing when I ask him what he wants his costume to be.--the costume I need to come up with in just a few days.\u00a0He's probably laughing because I keep asking him open-ended questions, like he is just going to answer me. As if today he will decide, or have the ability to say clearly, \"I don't want to be Luke Skywalker, I want to be Vader.\" It's happened before, a whole sentence clear and direct. He saves his words I think; saves them for what  he thinks  is  really  important. For every gazillion words I spill out of my mouth, he has three or four words. I guess it's not so surprising\u00a0that most people look forward to his.\u00a0 \n \n I let him linger in the sunlight that shimmers \u00a0across his face, filtered by the leaves just enough to make me resist putting on sunblock, lest I ruin the moment. \u00a0He continues his survey of our path, gathering stones and leaves and dropping them in some order I don't understand.\u00a0Jake is quiet and moves a little closer to me where I have sat down and begun pulling sour grass out by the roots. I love when\u00a0 oxalis \u00a0fills the yard in fall, but since everyone else thinks it's a weed, part of me feels compelled to rip each flower out. Then I contemplate how often I balance what I want to do against what others think I should do, and wonder how it influences my parenting and my children. I overheard Lucy saying, \"You shouldn't judge a book by its cover.\" the other day, so I know she's hearing me a little.\u00a0 \n \n The sun slides down faster than I expect it too, or else we've been outside longer than I had intended. Being with Jake in his moments is so peaceful. Aside from the crouched-down position he takes to do it, I can see how comforting it might be to sift through the pebbles and let them fall over the garden border. I love to plant bulbs and flowers, and have fond memories of my childhood at this time of year preparing the flower beds to receive more bulbs; anticipating what spring would bring.\u00a0 \n \n Time is different in a garden. Sometimes it feels like I've been pulling weeds for hours, but it can be pleasantly\u00a0surprising\u00a0to see how much I have accomplished when no one was watching over me, when I wasn't keeping score, when I couldn't see the hands on the clock from where I stood.\u00a0I can't hurry the bulbs. I can't will more perfect\u00a0breezy\u00a0afternoons to sit with my son on the sidewalk. I can water all I want, but sometimes I forget what I've planted where on this hard-to-manage slope in our front yard. Some years the garden is awhirl with color, and filled with fruits and vegetables. And sometimes our yard is dry, barren, waiting for the day when Descartes and I are both available at the same time to fix the sprinkler system; because some jobs just cannot be done alone.\u00a0 \n \n I can see the peach fuzz on Jake's cheek when he turns towards the sun, his eyes closed as he soaks in those afternoon rays. I wonder\u00a0what kind of man he will be when he's older, and\u00a0what will be his career? his calling? Will he be an\u00a0archaeologist? A forest ranger? A\u00a0geophysicist, surveying cores of the earth?\u00a0 \n He dribbles dirt and pebbles in a little pile next to my hand, then hops up and runs the rest of the way to our front door; it's as if he knew I was jumping too far ahead. I take a quick breath and run after him.. let's figure out Monday. The rest of the days will still be there when it's time.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n a version of this post was the editor's pick today at\u00a0 OpenSalon.com \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://open.salon.com/blog/jennyalice/2011/10/27/like_pebbles_through_the_hourglass"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/10/like-pebbles-through-hourglass.html", "title": "\nLike Pebbles Through the Hourglass\n"},

I think it's because he couldn't walk until he was two... just 5 weeks or so after this picture was taken. Before that he was always in our arms, cuddling, wrestling, being held. He's been crawling into our bed in the mornings lately. Not every day, and not in a quiet way at all. It is that same laughing boy, hugging us and wrestling and trying to hug his baby sister. It is my favorite thing... my FAVORITE thing in the world..morning and the sheets still smell like fabric softener and we have way too many pillows, of all sizes and squishiness, and everyone has messy hair and we are all there; all four of us laughing and tickling and kissing and hugging. It never lasts for long. There are jobs to get to and school bells will ring and the private swimming lessons we will pay for whether we make it to class or not.

{"date": "03 March, 2009", "body": "\nIt's always interesting for me to see my life through other people's eyes, or at least how I perceive others perceiving my world. Sometimes it's a great feeling; like when I found out that I was a nice person in first grade, or that someone always thought I had a good heart in high school. Or it is just sort of an uncomfortable feeling, like when my really neat, organized friend comes to my house the day before the housekeeper comes and sees how messy our house really can be. Other times it's more difficult for me, mostly when I see the things in my life over which I have no control and the things\u00a0I feel are out of control in my life. My parents came to visit this weekend, and honored my son by visiting the classroom where he has been for two and a half years. I think it's a hard thing for grandparents to face a grandchild's disability, mostly because it hits them twice, the first pain they have is for their grandchild, and the other is for their own child.. but they went just the same, and they gave a donation to Jake's classroom which will make a big dent in the glue stick, wipes and tissue debt that Jake's teacher has each year. We visited the library with Jake's class, then came back to the classroom while they ate pie to celebrate the bundle of joy Jake's aide is about to deliver. We sat at a table towards the back of the room at the library and later after the children were seated we declined pie, mostly so we could talk and watch Jake in his environment. Lucy was her usual self and infiltrated the classroom setting up shop next to the librarian for story time and at the head of the table during the afternoon sweet fest.\u00a0 Jake began being silly the minute he saw us all there. I\u00a0could tell that he was happy to see us, and he greeted both of my parents in his own way. Sometimes this just means a pause instead of walking on by you. He couldn't sit still in the library, he grabbed the hair of one (or three?) of his friends, and continued on in his grope-y happy silly way. My poor parents. I know that Jake has better behavior in class than this. Okay, I know at least some of the time he does. I know today he went to speech therapy with his  SLP  and she is 5 foot nothing and weighs ten pounds less than Jake...and she took him all by her lonesome to speech with no trouble.. so I know that he is more calm, less grabby, able to sit still at least some of the time. He did use a 'talker' while he was there ( to answer YES! for pie). Heck, I've taken him to the movies, so I know he can sit still at least for a little while... but then I saw him through their eyes. They see a little boy who will be taller than most of his caretakers \u00a0within the next two years, and a boy who is probably stronger than some of them already. They see a boy who still can't talk (because he did not use any words English or Spanish while they were with him). A boy in pull ups, a boy who needs to be fed most of his food. A boy who, even in a class with severe disabilities  looks  like a kid who has profound  disabilities . And of course they see his elfish ears and lean, healthy body and his beautiful hazel eyes (if you can catch a glimpse). Of course they see his smile, but they see the whole package. I don't see all of those things anymore, not  the  tough stuff. At least I do not see them all at once because it is overwhelming to think of how many of his goals are the same goals he's had since he was three. I do not want to feel as hopeless as someone could be living with \u00a0this beautiful boy\u00a0who develops so slowly I need to re-read this blog to find the changes he's made.\u00a0 We talked later in the weekend about our plans for Jake in the future, and of course I have one. I have a plan. I always have a plan. I know where everyone should be at all times..  indefinitely . And of course I have absolutely no idea what we will do, what I will do. Not. One. F* cking. \u00a0Clue. I am not sure right now how to even tackle tomorrow or Friday, or summer, or swimming lessons, or haircuts, or the sprinkler system, or finding shoes that fit my son. There is a list so long, I'm not even sure I have enough ink, (or gigabytes?) Some of the things we need to do can be fixed with more time, more money or more effort, but some things just aren't going to be fixed. Some things might not even get 'better'. So there they are, those things over which I have no control...\u00a0 except I do. because I am not doing anything for Jake right now. \u00a0That's how I feel. I think I have been using Lucy as an excuse.  Believing  that she takes up time so I can protect myself from the fact that I am at a bit of a loss as to how to help my kid.\u00a0 and there I go again, seeing my life as others may see it, and I am having that feeling again like I cannot nail down any of the corners and the canvas is getting smaller and the frame is getting bigger and bigger.\u00a0 and now for my internal pep talk : I have a list. Okay I am going to start a new list. On a clean sheet of paper. and I will check them all off one by one. and I am not depressed, and I will sell that stuff on eBay, and I will stop listening to the newscasters, and I will play more music and sing louder, and I will write daily because it makes me feel better every time. I will kiss my son in the morning, thankful for another day with him, another opportunity to make good choices for\u00a0 him  and for our family.\u00a0 and tomorrow night I will go to bed before midnight. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/03/things-to-do.html", "title": "\nThings to Do\n"},

It's about my life, which lately is just not that funny. I mean I can make most things sort of sound funny... like this one, ready? Beware of Safeway meatloaf, it nearly killed me. It was so tough I almost took off my left index finger a few weeks ago and had to go to the local emergency room to get four stitches to staunch the bleeding. The wait wasn't very long. I asked them to triage me last so I could actually get a nap. As I see it that visit will end up being 40 bucks a stitch and $200 an hour for a bed to nap in.  What really happened?  Jake was so upset, as he has been for weeks and weeks and weeks now that I was hurrying and watching him thrash at the counter with his aide and I stopped looking at what I was cutting and sliced my finger. It bled through a kitchen towel and I still finished making his dinner so I could feel comfortable that I was leaving the aide with as little else to manage as possible.  At the hospital I fell asleep on the gurney so hard that they were a little worried about me, as it seems they would leave the room for 20 seconds and I would fall sound asleep before they returned.  and then here's another good funny story: My younger brother Gerard came up for the weekend. He arrived just in time on Thursday to go out for drinks with all of my mama friends from SEPTAR, scaring them with his amazing white teeth and strong beach body builder physique. On Friday night we decided to eat dinner at home because Jake was having such a hard time. He yelled for me after he went to check on Jake who had gone to bed early. I ran down the stairs only to find my brother with blood all over his hands and when Jake slid a bit to the side, trying to wriggle away from Gerard, blood all over the floor. Dude.. welcome to my home. okay I can't even make that story funny. After we put Jake to bed he continued to thrash about. I gave him the max on the  benzodiazepine  that was recently prescribed by the Psychiatrist. Apparently, this stronger and \"smoother\" drug takes more time to kick in and more time to wear off, than the other one we had used sporadically to control extremely out-of-control, dangerous, thrashing. We kept checking on him, but Gerard was the one who found him covered in blood, coming from an unidentified head wound. Head wounds bleed a lot, and after carrying Jake upstairs and putting him in his 5 point car seat in the car, which the only place we can truly hold him down without hurting ourselves, we cleaned up the wound and decided not to go to the ER. Staples that would probably get pulled out by Jake would inevitably be harder to deal with than waiting until the swelling in the little know went down and the 1cm would closed up. It wasn't long before the bleeding stopped, but it was several more hours until we felt comfortable that Jake wasn't going to bash his head into another wall downstairs, so he sat in the living room with us, belted into his thank-God-we-have-this wheelchair.  It was awesome. Jake's car seat still has Descartes' shirt over it covered in dried blood.(which Descartes stripped on and held against Jake's head as soon as he saw the blood.. God I love that man who knows how to react...) okay so you can see...not that funny.  I also have an injured shoulder from Jake ripping my arm out of the socket (practically) which, while it is healing, and I am going to PT, makes me incapable of doing many household tasks well or at all... and my house was not looking good to begin with. And then I had an IEP for Jake, which led to the need to have another one (those went very well, just took a long time). And I had a really emotional day after  getting Jake into Camp . You would think that it would just make me happy, but it is a really bad process to sign kids up for 1:1 aides. I know I must be first my son's advocate, but it makes me cry (while driving friends on the highway in my Not-so-mini van at 75mph.. not good) and did I tell you about the 2 inch nail Jake stepped on last week? I don't think I did. Went into and back out of his foot. His high pain tolerance meant that he did it while I was 12 feet away from him, and did not know expect for a strange drawing-in of breath that he took loudly. It was an odd enough sound that I watched him for a minute noticed a slight limo and asked Descartes to check out his foot as he passed by. He just scooped Jake up and said we are going to the hospital. I called  Sage  and she came for Lucy without waiting for me to tell her why I needed last-minute babysitting.  The ER was great.  They \"got\" Jake, and didn't insist on numbing his foot all up with a bunch of needles before we took out the nail. It came out as it had gone in quickly. Jake only cried when they washed his foot, and I am guessing it is only because we held him too still. We were able to spend the entire next day focused on Jake because Squid took Lucy home with her to play with Mali. I haven't been laughing a lot lately.  I am okay. Good things have been happening too. I know they have. We decided on the list of contributors for the next  Can I Sit With You?  book due out in November. Jake continues to say more words at school-- \"No! Applesauce!\" when offered yogurt. Lucy is starting to sleep a little better. My closet is clean. I have amazing friends who jump at the chance to help us. We went to the new  California Academy of Sciences  which the kids loved.  Those things aren't funny either, but it is my life. This is all just one part of my life, which will pass. Hopefully I am in a learning phase right now so that the next part is really really easy, and less physically painful, and funny. Maybe it will be funny.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://cbslocalblogs.prospero.com/n/blogs/blog.aspx?webtag=kpix_eyeonblogs", "http://www.squidalicious.com", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine", "http://www.squidalicious.com/2008/10/leelo-is-going-to-camp.html", "http://the-mama.blogpspot.com", "http://www.sequoiahospital.org/Medical_Services/Emergency_Medicine/index.htm", "http://www.canisitwithyou.org/?p=188", "http://www.calacademy.org/"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/10/just-not-that-funny.html", "title": "\nJust not That Funny\n"},
{"date": "03 May, 2010", "body": "\n My whole life I have been told that I \"burn the candle at both ends\", or I \"run myself ragged\" or, perhaps in my least graceful moments, I \"run around like a chicken with its head cut off.\" \n I do, absolutely, too many things in too little time, and yet most of the time I feel like I get nothing done at all. \n When I was younger, as a manager for Gap, I would work both the 6:30am to 3:30pm shipment shift and the 12:30 to 9:30pm closing shift so I could cut payroll at my store. Working both shifts was not really possible (which did not mean it was discouraged). It meant that I did not take a lunch break,\u00a0 a dinner break, and if I could swing it, a bathroom break from 10am to 7pm when the store was open. It was ugly. Looking back I can understand why I was thin and had headaches all the time. I lived on Diet Coke (only because  Rockst *r wasn't sold yet), and  Brachs  starlight mints. \n The best part of working that crazy day? I could schedule enough managers the  next  day so I could take a day off. That left me free, after I locked those doors at 9:30pm, to head straight to Larry Blake's, or Bottom of the Hill, or Hotel Utah, so I could dance from the band's introduction to the last notes of  Picture Book Pretty . I will never be so in control of my life again; the only thing stopping me from doing whatever I wanted to do, was me. The only thing that held me back was an apparent need for a modicum of sleep. Damn that need for sleep. \n Recalling all of this in a conversation with my friend Sage, I began to tell her of some the places I have inappropriately fallen very, very, deeply asleep. Here are a few of my favorites \n \n \n \u00a9  BrokenSphere  /   Wikimedia  Commons \n The North Reading Room, Doe Memorial Library, Berkeley, CA Contrary to popular belief I did study, several times, when I went to Cal. My favorite place to study was the North Reading Room in the main library. I think you get smarter when you walk in the door. It feels like you are in a movie about a great university whenever you plop down in one of those wooden chairs at the long heavy tables.\u00a0 I fell asleep here once while highlighting a \"reader\". Remember those? $250 for a bunch of photocopies bound together with a plastic binding? I fell asleep with the lid off my bright orange highlighter, tip on the page and soaked through many, many, many, pages. It also leaked on to my arm. I also drooled. It was dark when I woke up. \n \n \n \n \n \n AC transit bus   /   Wikimedia  Commons \n \n \u00a0An AC Transit bus Route 51 After an extremely grueling debutante tea I attended in San Francisco I decided that I could not walk back up the hill from BART, and took a bus for a mile and a half. I must have sat down and fallen straight asleep. When I awoke a short 8 blocks later, I was leaning on the entire right side of a 20-something rocker type with dreads coming off his head in a star Mohawk-type pattern, sporting a jacket made of safety pins and body odor. I had to give away the suit I wore that day because I could not get the smell of that man off the sleeve of my nautical-inspired,  kelly  green jacket and navy skirt even after two trips to the dry cleaner. I am not sure that guy ever even noticed I was there, but I will never forget him. A Nail Salon Chair This actually happens quite often, but there was one time, during a period in our life when Jake was not sleeping  at all  that I decided to treat myself to a pedicure; if I couldn't have sleep I would at least have soft feet. I went to a small place that was stacked high with junk magazines. I sat down with a big stack of People and Cosmo and Us, and must have fallen asleep in mere moments. I woke up over an hour later, leaning to the left,\u00a0 the stack of magazines scattered to the floor between the chair and the wall, my head lolling about over the side of the chair. My toes were pretty, and the young women were eating their lunch quietly so as not to wake me. \n I was thinking about these, and all of the other places I fought my heavy eyelids,\u00a0 because lately I've been that tired again. Jake has had migraines, or sleep disruption or something this week, and my worries are different now that he's older and gained more skill. It's been years since I really slept all night long unless I take  Benedryl  or something. I get out of bed a minimum of five times to check on the kids most nights. Jake's covers slide off of him, and if they get to the floor he can't coordinate all of that to get them off the floor and get cozy again, and without covers he is understandably cold, so he doesn't sleep well and our mornings are more rough. He's been out of bed and wandering this last week, and while we have gates and locks and all sorts of things to keep his little self safe, I cannot help but worry that one night he will gain just that much more skill and be able to unlock the front door; he would be gone forever. So any movement or sound that does not sound like my children sleeping has me out of bed and down the hall. \n I am trying to figure  out how we fence in our front yard with a six foot barrier without seeming  to be unfriendly, and outside of the building codes which dictate that  front fences be no higher than three or four feet (like a little white picket).  It would be a great comfort to know that even if he did get out the  front door there would another safeguard before the cars and a steep hill  and perhaps I would be able to sleep with both eyes closed.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S9xeHTJDstI/AAAAAAAACaI/axY8353-ZCg/s1600/450px-Doe_Memorial_Library_North_Reading_Room_lamp.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S9xh9tsm9oI/AAAAAAAACaQ/wOBW9FtQm_8/s1600/800px-ACTrans_51.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S956CkhrvnI/AAAAAAAACaU/Xe2-O4cD9Kk/s1600/chair_1.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/05/when-you-burn-candle-at-both-ends.html", "title": "\nWhen You Burn the Candle at Both Ends\n"},
{"date": "09 August, 2008", "body": "\nMost of the time I forget about the life I kind of expected. My dear friend, KFJ just sent me a great email...the highlights of their trip to family camp, something they've been doing for years. Our alma mater has a family camp like this one, and I had nearly forgotten that I had sort of pledged to myself as a dreamy eyed senior that I would make sure my family went to The Lair every year to be exposed to nature and to other families that loved their college and education. Silly maybe, but I loved the idea. I was always a Go Bears! sort of ambassador at Cal, and at the time could never imagine that the reason I wouldn't be going to family camp wasn't because we were working in France or Japan.. that the very reason for going to a camp like this would be the thing that stopped me...my kid. So I forgot. KFJ's oldest daughter Papaya is Jake's age; almost exactly. We have a great(?!) photo of the two of them, Papaya sitting up so nicely, Jake being temporarily propped up by a Bobby so he doesn't take a header. I knew then that my kid was different. I knew, but it was watching my friend from college with her daughter that was just one more shocker that this life was going to be a lot different than I imagined. but I forgot that too. Maybe that's a blessing of having a kid with weird sleep issues and the ability to nearly conk me out by accident just by getting out of the tub, perhaps the brutality of our daily living helps me forget, just as most women can't remember giving birth. If we remembered how would we do it again.. if I constantly remembered the loss how would I face tomorrow. And so I forget all of those little 22 year old fantasies. That's what they were any way.  We dream so we can set goals and start running.  But tonight I read the email (which I love.. so don't stop sending them Kung Fu...) and I just wept as I looked at the slide show. Her beautiful talented, smart children looking at the camera, or smiling at their counselor. Performing at the talent show, swimming without diapers, riding bicycles, hell.. wearing a bicycle helmet. Jake won't even tolerate a friggin' helmet! So I will wallow for a few minutes. It feels a little (okay a lot) indulgent. My child is alive and healthy. My son managed to get through IKEA twice this week, which is more than most kids can do. And when he hugs me I know he means it because it is so hard for him to pause and connect it is not out of guilt or direction; he is doing it to connect. And he smirks when his baby sister is a brat. And he tried to play cars with Sage's daughter the other day. So we are good. And school starts on Monday. And. And. And.  and I am sad. and I can't help it dammit. And envy is the ugliest sin I can ever imagine, and right now I want a little bit of what someone else has, and I hate HATE being the person who wants what others have because I already have so much. I just wanted to go camping. I just want my children to take a picture together.  I just want to forget again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/08/i-forget.html", "title": "\nI Forget\n"},

Jake has had migraines every day and he's out of school, and therefore not following his usual routine, so he's basically been out of sorts, and throwing himself around and crying a lot and whining and whining. And Lucy is struggling with sleep issues having a difficult time letting her body rest when her mind is still active (OMG she is so my daughter!) And of course Jake's aide has been amazingly late or absent.. even though I have begun anticipating her tardiness, the not showing up on Monday followed by the 1.75 hours late on Tuesday was just more than I could have possibly accounted for. And we are leaving for a camping trip with the in-laws and I am doing most of the meal planning, purchasing and cooking. I still need to make two quiche and a birthday cake today. I had friends who needed help this week with their kids and I couldn't do it. I know I am not responsible for everyone else all the time, but most of the time I try so very hard to help other people out because I really, really know that feeling of needing help. And this week I couldn't offer it to anyone else, because I am barely okay myself. On Tuesday and Wednesday nights, after my children were tucked into bed I proceeded to escape my house and my life. Tuesday drinking and hot tubbing and singing along with music so loudly that the cops paid us a visit, and last night out in San Francisco with friends from Business School most of whom don't have kids, sipping expensive wine in a swanky place co-owned by a guy from Barcelona. I drank too much both nights. I stayed out too late both nights.  This is a perfect example of me taking care of myself the wrong way. I was so mentally exhausted when I started this week that I had no where else to go but down I think. I didn't help my friends, I didn't accomplish anything around the house or do anything very fun with the kids because I couldn't count on the babysitter. I just haven't felt right all week long.  and then I remember that this is how I used to feel all the time. Jake, his episodes before the migraine meds and the Zoloft.. 52 days without really sleeping. This is how I felt for years. I looked gray. My joints ached. I felt old. So while I am still tired and need to take care of myself by eating a little better and getting some good sleep and drinking even just a glass of water during the day, I know that this will all pass. I will be able to help someone else after I get my own mask on.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/07/wheres-that-damn-mask.html", "title": "\nWhere's that Damn Mask?\n"},

It seems silly perhaps, but today, again, it feels like I have witnessed something amazing. Jake walked everyone out to the gate, and initiated goodbye to his Papa. He is getting very good at ducking into people's arms for a small cuddle. Friends and family have noticed him initiating this more and more. He build relationship in his own way with each person.

Ways we celebrated: LAST WEEK: Descartes, Jake, Lucy and I drove to Carmel on Friday to meet my parents. Gloria and PJ were so very generous and got us a place at the Carmel Highlands Resort for Friday night. Poor Descartes, he had to work all day, so he worked via laptop with a beautiful view and takeout lunch while Grandma and Grandpa and I took the two kiddos to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I drove my parents in my Not-so-mini-Van, and was, once again reminded that it is not as clean a car as some might like. Thank goodness for baby wipes which we keep by the bushel full in the car.. saved my mom from riding in a PILE of petrified chicken and fries which had tried to liberate themselves by crawling under my son's car seat. The aquarium was great. The weather was beautiful. My passes are still valid. My kids looked clean (enough). It was really very nice. Apparently my daughter and her grandmother share an affection for sea otters. Jake was in awe of the  anchovies swimming round and round in the ceiling at the entrance to the Outer Bay display. There were lots of \"Jake's friends\" at the aquarium. My parents are better at spotting \"them\" now, just as I can rather easily identify the 8 year old that still needs to hold hands, or the soft smile on even a tiny infant with Down Syndrome, and the stroller that is really a mobility device. It's a skill that, while I appreciate my parents learning, I wish they had never started looking. I wish  I  had never started looking. I think it makes them feel like there is no safe place, and no family goes untouched. Sort of how I am amazed when ANY kid comes out of a womb without a major  difference.  My mom spotted the little boy wearing noise canceling headphones following his dad while holding a very short string as we were leaving. She asked, \"Is he...?\" and then I am the expert in a subject that has no course outline. Thinking to myself all of the reasons a kid would possibly be wearing headphones, which are not connected to anything, I conclude that, along with the hand flapping and lip chewing, the child might be \"a friend of Jake's\". I explain that one of the reasons we \"all\" come here is because it is a safe, enclosed place which feels open, near water without being dangerously near water, educational, and FILLEd with places that allow our children to 'stim' and have it be \"normal\". I have never seen a kid who did not look up at that anchovy exhibit without awe and a desire to stare for several minutes longer than mom and dad like.

So I said \"That's okay, never mind, it sounds like you are in sort of a bad mood, and I have a seven year old with a migraine so I don't care how much it is I will take it now. Thank you so much.\" And she hemmed and hawed and said I would need to come back. and I started to cry and said \"I am having such an extremely bad day, a bad week really, and I have a child with a migraine and we need that medicine now. So I will just go ahead and pay the money and take the prescription now. It's not a problem.\" Through the bullet-proof drive-through window glass, she held the medicine up in her hand close to her body and said I would need to come back. And I said, \"I will pay you the money for the prescription now. You will give me the medicine and I will leave right now with my son's medication. I am paying you now and you will give me the medicine and then I would like to leave right now.\" She paused, sort of unsure, it seemed, of what to do with that many directives from someone who is not her boss. Then she finally, reluctantly, slowly went to the register with the money I had shoved in the metal box (after reaching in and grabbing the handle so I could pull it out myself and shove cash in.) She started to be argumentative again as I took the medicine. I said \"I need to go now.\" and so I left. what a piece of work she was...'cause that was EXACTLY what my day needed. The good news is that apparently she is a \"floater\", and not a new employee at my pharmacy...so I hopefully will never see her again. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/08/wow-now-thats-customer-service.html", "title": "\nWow.

{"date": "23 May, 2008", "body": "\nI did it. I took Jake out with his buddy from school yesterday. That little boy was so wonderful. Polite and the kind of kid we only hope ours act like when apart from us. He was a joy. Jake was so happy. It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I mean it was later..but that's another story. __________________________ Okay the other story I can tell now that I am not trying to type from my phone...it was hard because LATER.. I got to thinking about how Jake's friend and I talked about all sorts of things he likes to do, and who he plays with, and when I dropped him off he was able to tell me where he lived, and who his neighbors are. He could read the menu. He ordered his own lunch. He asked if he could use the bathroom. He made a joke about something. Basically he was a \"typical\" kid (although he is actually more than typical, he is truly exceptional with his compassion and awareness of others and their feelings and needs.) I got to thinking about the fact that Jake isn't like that. Now we have plenty of friends who have kids the same age who have sailed on by Jake with their abilities, but we have known those people forever, so it is sometimes painful when comparison is  impossible to squelch, but generally that just stopped happening years ago. But here was a kid who is in the class next door to my kid. I am not often derailed with this emotion anymore. I know it will happen again and again as \"typical\" milestones come and go, but most of the time I prepare myself for them.  Last night I just had to swallow that little sadness and be so, so thankful that Jake's friend's parents have raised such a good kid. Thankful that Jake sends some sort of vibe out into the world that draws at least a few kids near him, (even a little girlfriend for awhile!)  I praised Jake in the car after his friend left, letting him know that it speaks to his character that other kids like him even though he doesn't talk very much. I told him that some of his friends probably appreciate that he is a very good listener. I swallowed that little pain (with a little cocktail I'll admit) knowing that I never would have met this delightful boy if Jake wasn't the child he is, and I probably never would have appreciated the wonder of watching a child read his own menu, buckling his own seat belt and thanking me for lunch. I am a better person with Jake in my life. I know I am. So I am choosing to be just ever so thankful to Jake's friend for being nice to my kid, for coming with us to lunch, and for wanting to do it again sometime...also for asking if Jake would like to play basketball at his house sometime.. .because Jake's friend? He volunteered to help Jake play.

We had the \"art opening\" at the Main Library here in Deadwood City. This is the art that was made possible by the grant applied for by DoubleTrouble and executed by Mamalicia, then turned into beautiful cards by Captain Blog.  To order your set of cards  visit our website  and send an email to septarinfo@gmail.com the buddy Jake did his art project with came to the opening with his momma. He is the same boy who went on a date with us on Thursday. I must say again that he is one of the kindest little boys I have ever met. While he was at the library he made Jake a card that said \"I had a great time at Johnny Rockets. I am having a great time at the library today too. I really like being your buddy.\" He drew pictures of a fish and several other creatures. He thanked me for inviting him to the art show. It was more than heart warming. ...surprised by death, even when we know it is coming, for all of us eventually: my girlfriend Pinks lost her momma this week after a very long battle with cancer. It was hard for me not to go be with her, even though it was not expected, and cost prohibitive, and would have been extremely hard on Descartes to juggle both children and work. I have an acquaintance, someone I met through close friends who has just entered the hospital for hospice. She is dying. She's only 38. I won't pretend that we are close friends, but I have laughed more than a few times with her, and care very much about Lovey who is her best friend. It will be so hard on Lovey and there is just not much we can do to make it easier for either of them. She is dying, and we knew it was going to come. We have known for awhile, but it is just so hard to imagine that the girl who danced on the bar with me, at Tao,  in  Vegas... is the same girl who is trying to get pain relief in her final days. I do not, at all, fear my own death. Not in any way, except to be pained that I will not be able to care for Jake, and who else will possibly care for him if I am not here. I am reminded that I need to get our ducks in a row to make sure that Jake and Lucy will be cared for in case I am surprised by my own demise. ...perplexed that I cannot make simple foods, but have mastered the most complex of recipes: I cannot make pancakes from a mix. I suck SUCK at making pancakes. I need to look up how to hard boil an egg, and I have failed at Jello every single time I have ever made it. Who fails at Jello? I can make an angel food cake from scratch, a souffl\u00e9 which defies gravity and a chocolate cheesecake that was good enough to garner $200 at an auction.  ...delighted when watching my husband plan an adventure: we are planning our ten-year anniversary mini-vacation, and have just, in our typical fashion decided that we should go while Jake is at camp at the end of June! we have decided to stay on the west coast of this continent and that is as far as we have gotten. Exceptions may be made for Jamaica, Banff, and Montana. we have recently excluded Panama due to the high incidence of armed robberies and kidnapping. We do not currently have time to be kidnapped. high on the list:  Ten-ee-ah Lodge, The Royal in Cancun (technically not on the Pacific Coast,  I know.) ...disappointed that I cannot complete simple household projects: our downstairs bathroom has been \"undone\" for a year. It is only half drywalled and has the new toilet installed. We have also managed to place the shower stall floor pan. We have purchased the tile and the grout, and the glass for the shower but just can't seem to get it together to finish the damn thing. we have new lights, purchased in December, for the hallways up and down and Jake's bedroom which currently has the old overhead light with no glass in it. It broke last December which is why I bought the lights in the first place. I am hoping that eventually he will not have to stare at bare bulbs. ...thankful that this is my life, exactly as it is: i have the most precious children, the smartest husband and the coziest home. I am a lucky woman. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://septar.org/DrawnTogether.html", "http://www.realresorts.com/The_Royal_Cancun/Suites/Royal_Swim_Up_Master_Suite/", "http://www.realresorts.com/The_Royal_Cancun/Suites/Royal_Swim_Up_Master_Suite/"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2008/05/i-am-always.html", "title": "\nI am always\n"},

Jaster didn't like the idea of his boys being so far away from him, sad and sick, so he hopped in his car this morning to come get his family.  A bit irrational perhaps, since Demanda and I were going to come up on Thursday night, but a parent's love is kooky like that. I've never been apart from my kids when they were sick, so I can imagine I would be doing the same thing. Of course this week is sort of a big one in his job, since he's a pastor and all, so I'm thinking he weighed one kind of stress against the other and decided that an extra round trip to the Bay Area was worth it to not worry about his kids. We had a hard week last week. Descartes had a board meeting at the office which always seems to make his office a bit crazy, and consequently makes him a little less available physically and mentally, Jake had early day every single day for parent teacher conferences,  SEPTAR  had a  summer resources  meeting which I arranged via a gajillion emails with strangers, then I went to the meeting of course, Jake's aide canceled for no reason and then a good reason for three of five days, I had a doctor's appointment where I had to decide whether I was going to take a medication to take care of myself and finally get Lucy all the way weaned (yes she is still nursing, and at this rate will probably do so until she is thirteen!), and on another morning I had to be up at 3:30am to wait in line to sign up Jake for summer camp. Then Lucy got sick. and  then  I made brunch on Sunday for Descartes' parents and Papa's sister visiting from Canada, and Cookie's sister visiting from New York. So for Demanda, I am guessing it was not a fun place to visit.

That puts me (voluntarily) in charge of rat clean up. He is really a wonderful husband and father, so in this one area, it is my pleasure(?!) to take care of cleaning little bloody paw prints from our very own Remy off of the floor, and picking up his lifeless body after it has been ferociously snapped by my baited trap. Rats in your kitchen suck. If you have never had a rat in your kitchen consider yourself the luckiest person in the world. Our neighbors removed a ton of brush from their front yard (big bushes and 500 + square feet of juniper). It is better for the neighborhood to remove the habitat, but in a pinch, it turns out that the space behind the kitchen baseboards in my house makes a decent enough home for two rats for a week. I am normally a generous hostess. We spent nearly all day on Sunday removing the baseboards, then taking wire mesh and stapling it up under the kitchen cabinets so that the 1 1/2\" opening was sealed. I then crawled under the back kitchen window box and discovered where they were coming in and sealed it up with steel wool and more fine metal mesh. Let us pray that there were a)only two of them b)if there were more than two, that they are all trapped  outside  the house and not  inside  and c)in the current torrential downpour the little buggers do not attempt to get in our home through any other narrow secret rat passage. Perhaps I will recover soon and share more exciting things like: Jake pooped on the potty at school AGAIN! Lucy, at 20 months has begun speaking in 8-word sentences: \"Mommy, I want to wash my hands please.\" Descartes and I had a lovely first play date with a couple and their two children... where Jake's (dis)abilites were neither feared nor obsessed over. We just had a plain old relaxing time. The mommy works with Descartes and the daddy is a kid watcher like me.. but he is a master home brewer.. play`dates are always better with beer! The backyard patio is done and Descartes has re-worked the pergola thingy and we have enough amps in the outside subp-panel to put a hot tub out there!

{"date": "23 March, 2008", "body": "\nHow am I supposed to get anything done if my son is home for two weeks straight and we have no spring break family vacations planned. Do people really take spring breaks? I mean after college? Spring break was timed near  Easter  this year (which is the first time Easter has been this early since the 1800s, and won't be this early again for something like 230 more years) but nowhere near  Pesach   which isn't until April. I am exhausted just thinking about this week. I am still having a little trouble getting Jake's aide to be timely. I don't know that she realizes that while I can't \"write her up\", I can look for a new aide. She is good with Jake, but waiting for help to arrive is really not helpful. She has spring break right now too, and I cannot quite understand why someone who needs to earn extra money wouldn't be jumping at the chance to work full-time for a week either. I mean it is not always an easy thing to care for Jake, but when I was younger I jumped at any chance I had to pay off my student loans, buy a round of beer or a new skirt from Gap. Just a different mind-set I suppose. If she can be on time for the next two weeks we will be okay, but I am now trying to figure out if she is the right person to be  Jake's aide this summer. I hate looking for the right aide for Jake, for our family... One summer we had Miss Emily help with Jake. She has a brother with special needs, so she just wasn't afraid of Jake, at all. I bought season passes to Great America, and after going with the two of them a few times I realized that she was perfectly capable of taking him by herself. They even went to the water park (she was a certified lifeguard too). I would love it if Miss Emily could come back, but alas, she is a little smarty pants and has taken her little Valedictorian self off to college, and spends the summer doing things like going to Morocco as an exchange student. Jake was littler then. And he is only going to get bigger, and bigger. I am going to try to go to the Y after Descartes gets home from work this week. My back is wrenched again. Something down near my sacrum... in fact after a little research just now it looks like it is more like an inflammation of my  sacroilic  joint  .  Fanfkngtastic ! Shite I am falling apart. I keep asking my mom, Gloria..\"At what age, precisely, did you begin to fall apart?\" and she always tells me that we are different people blah blah.. but now I am guessing it was 36 years, 2 months. Descartes says my warranty must have just run out and that's why everything keeps breaking, 'cause isn't that how it always works in our life? In other news we were in Tahoe for Easter, where  Demanda  and  Jaster  made yummy quiche and my  sistow  made home made cinnamon rolls that she let rise three times. She also made Easter baskets and made sure her little boys had matching outfits and precious white lace up shoes... so pretty much she is amazing. The church was packed this morning too,  and there were a lot of new faces, which is always a good thing. Lots of babies and young families. OH...  and at the last minute, our younger brother Albert showed up with his new girlfriend.  Three out of the four of us kids ended up together for a weekend... doesn't happen very often. They were both very sweet with all seventeen thousand kids (are there  really  only four of them?), and they showed us their very cool shoes... Fluevogs ... which is apparently what I might have thought about purchasing if I was young and had disposable income.   Albert's shoes are very cool , but I can't imagine Descartes ever wearing them.. and I also can't imagine them ever being made in a size 16! Al's girlfriend bought  these  . I would buy  these for me  and  these for Descartes   just in case the Easter Bunny is still making deliveries this evening.

They have been the best friends we have ever had.  And now their kid barely remembers me when I call to wish his daddy happy birthday. We used to go to Montana every year with them.. and before there was a \"them\" and an \"us\" I went with Dognobble and groups of friends and we helped build the cabin, plant trees and watch the stars. We used to go to their house and stay up all night long drinking Lime Rickey-Mickey's, good Scotch and bubbly water, and wine, and one time tequila when we had run out of everything else. All while our child slept in a pack and play in the guest room. We used to take walks along all of the beautiful paths in their town, and spent several Halloweens touring their safe flat city. We actually talk when we are with Dognobble and DB. They are much more liberal than we are.. or at least they think they are, since we hold our hand pretty close, but they are damn smart and so open to discussion that by the end of each evening at least one of us seriously considers taking on a new opinion on any given subject. After one night I went and bought a book on world religion and another documenting the ongoing saga of \"Peace\" in the Middle East. Not exactly easy conversations. At some point it got too hard. They have always been so warm and welcoming with Jake. Loving and asking all the right questions and saying all the right things every time, but it was too hard for me and Descartes. Too hard to take Jake and have him flip out at their house because he had such crazy sleep problems, maybe too hard to have Jake not be able to play with their precious and oh-so-smart and physically capable son Teton.  Their house is on the way to my sister's house, and whereas it used to be that Dognobble's home was our final destination, we continue on to Tahoe now. They had a second child, also perfect and wonderful, and still we managed to see them, managed to get to Montana, and now all of a sudden, or not suddenly at all, Teton can barely remember who we are, and doesn't remember meeting Lucy at all. Dognobble is very important to me; they both are, but Dognobble occupies a special place in my heart. Yes, I did date him in college, but it was a very brief relationship that turned into a much better and deeper friendship...mostly, he is important because he knew me when I was all hope. When I could still be anything in the world I wanted to be, and I was going to be. He knew me when I went dancing at least two, if not three nights out of seven, and still managed to work 80 hours a week,  and still  have more energy to make cakes for friend's birthdays and drop in on a recording session  or two, just to hear people lay down amazing music. I am pouring myself a glass of wine and toasting Dognobble. Toasting all of his successes, and his beautiful wife, and his amazing children...and his ability to help me remember some of who I was when it is hard for me to see that bright-eyed girl in the mirror.

He was gone for nearly two hours, maybe more... and when he returned there was a fridge standing up in a pick-up bed, parked behind my house, looking like  the Westin Bonaventure Hotel on Los Angeles.  It was massive, and the longer it sat there, the heavier it got ( I swear!) and truly, the hotter it got until I contemplated wearing oven mitts as we maneuvered it off the back of the trailer, down a makeshift ramp and onto solid ground. We figured it out, and it is safely plugged in and filled with our savories and sweets, but not before we: nearly took out a rain gutter, an overhead light fixture and the screen door, and not before removing both doors of the appliance. It was really, really not easy, but like most things in our little life, when Descartes and I work together, we are nearly unstoppable.  www.canisitwithyou.blogspot.com \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/property/photos/index.html?propertyID=1004#photo_section_0Link"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2007/09/shiny-bright-and-new.html", "title": "\nShiny, Bright and New\n"},

Today I had a lovely breakfast with Bridquet and her daughter at one of my favorite cafes.. Lucy's trial run at daycare was cancelled (making me feel so relieved it nearly makes me want to never work again).   I got to Trader Joe's buying the much needed 2 Buck Chuck requested by my sister Demanda... I fed Lucy lunch. I picked up Jake from the bus with plenty of time to spare.. I accomplished a lot.. or what I lacked in volume I made up for with success. Small victories are good. We were invited to go swimming at Squid's house.. lucky us, and I had all sorts of grand plans to take Jake and Lucy and Jake's aide Valerie and head to Squid's house, but in keeping with my  above stated efforts, I took a \"Yes\" \"No\" card we have taped to the fridge and actually asked Jake: \"Do you want to go swimming?\" He hits the \"No\" side of the card, but it looks like he may be hitting something (a drum?) next to it, so I remove the object and ask again. He looks at \"No\". I ask him again with the card in front of my face. It is see-through so I can see where his eye gaze heads...\"No\". So I ask the same if he still wants to go to Ms. Squid's house and play on the trampoline or something else \"No\". and a little bit of a verbal \"nah\". Then, to double check, I ask \"Do you want to stay home?\" I get the eye gaze and a tap on the card in the \"yes\" corner. So I talk to him about how that is totally fine, I understand because he is tired etc. and I pack up Lucy and we say goodbye and we go for a fun swimming session with Squid and her three guppies and another friend and her guppy joins  (can every one's kid swim but mine? working on it....) When we get home I discover that the moment we shut the door behind us, Jake ran to the door, threw himself on the ground and whined/yelled. Valerie explained to him that he had said he didn't want to go and that we would be back.. Apparently he sulked for quite awhile. Did he think I wasn't going to go if he didn't want to? When I asked him that question, as I hugged him on the couch when we got home... he looked me right in the eye, then buried his head into the couch. What goes on in his head?

This important book co-edited by special needs parents Shannon Des Roches Rosa and Jennifer Byde Myers is a collection of stories about schoolyard social experiences, both good and bad. All proceeds from the the event and from the sale of Can I Sit With You? go directly to SEPTAR, the fledgling Special Education PTA of Redwood City (www.septar.org). Queer Open Mic is a twice monthly gathering of poets, performers, writers and artists of all types to come together and share art. Proto-feminist and genderqueer in scope, QOM aims to combine raunchy enthusiasm, warmth and community, unapologetic queer, radical politics and sweet rhythms to create a space for spoken word, poetry and performance that is multi cultural, multi gendered, completely inclusive and dynamic. QOM is hosted by Cindy Emch and Mollena Williams. Please show up around 7:30pm to sign up on the open mic list. You're encouraged to read one piece of work that is five minutes or less. And by encouraged we mean threatened with spankings, shoe throwings and general hilarious tantrums if you don't follow the rules. About the Performers: Liz Henry lives in many intersecting communities, as a feminist, poet, translator, blogger, science fiction fan, queer & genderqueer writer, and computer geek. She's had work published in Parthenon West, Xantippe, Lodestar Quarterly, Poetry Flash, Two Lines, Cipactli, caesura, other, Literary Mama, Strange Horizons, and has been publishing zines and little books since 1986. SJ Alexander lives in Seattle, avidly follows the doings of Britney Jean Spears, and is a Kennedy Administration buff. SJ writes almost daily at \"I, Asshole\" online. Sarah M. Glover is a recovering C.P.A. who lives and writes in San Francisco. She is currently using her young children as guinea pigs while manically scribbling away about ghosts and fairies. Hopefully, the scribbling will make it into a book before they leave for college. Michael Procopio lives in San Francisco, but has yet to figure out the precise name of his neighborhood. He is a food blogger who dislikes the word \"blogger\" almost as much as he does the words \"moist,\" \"classy,\" and \"slacks.\" His likes include the drawings of Edward Gorey, Cotswold cheese, and the musical stylings of Jacques Brel.

{"date": "31 August, 2007", "body": "\nDid you know that the  spa  at  Grand Wailea  is one of the finest spas in the world? It really, really is beautiful. Descartes and I had a couple's massage on Thursday morning when we were in Wailea and it was absolutely wonderful. Beautiful temperature, the  Term\u00e9 HydroTherapy  before hand makes you feel clean and pure and the pre-massage \"peaceful pampering continues as a personal spa attendant gives you a complimentary body scrub of Hawaiian exfoliants\" Wow, if someone could just come loofah my whole body once a week and gently rinse me off with warm water... I just might make it through this crazy life. Because this is what happened just before we went to the spa: My brother\u2019s room was attached to our room, so we opened the door between the two rooms so the little girls could play together, and little Bubsy is in love with Jake, so she is very precious and constantly wants to go look at him, hug him and say \"Hi\". Since little Bubsy has never really been watched by anyone but family we made sure she had her own nanny\u2026 so my kids had one and his kid had one.. so two adults three kids two 6oo+ square foot rooms. Gerard and Pinky had an earlier spa treatment than we did, so they left first and came back first. Basically we were all in my brother\u2019s room watching the two little girls be extra cute, and we were all ignoring Jake. It is hard because he can entertain himself so easily that it is sometimes possible to forget that we should engage him since he can\u2019t engage us as readily\u2026 well he was in the other room (our room) then there was some yelling, and it sounded like he was very frustrated. Then Pinky says \u201cEwww someone has the poops, bad\u201d. So Descartes went to check Jake and I checked Lucy. Then I hear \u201cjenny ALICE ! I\u2019m gonna need some  help , and Lucy should stay in there\u201d. Well Jake had pooped, and his diaper had fallen off which explains why he had come to the door between the rooms a bunch of times (lousy mommy... if I only had hindsight all the time.. I would catch all of the cues). Descartes took Jake to  the shower , I took towels to the floor and began scrubbing out what his right foot had stepped in and squished onto the floor. Descartes didn\u2019t know it was on his foot when he made Jake  WALK  across the entire hotel room. It was a mess. Then Gerard and Pinky had to leave so Lucy stayed in with Bubsy for a bit longer until we had it together\u2026 our nanny (who we did not rehire after this incident.. we found another awesome one instead) had arrived some time during this fiasco and was with both little girls and Lisa, the other Nanny. I scrubbed and blotted and dried and wiped and took a big pile of trash out of the room, and a wash load of towels to the linen service room which was right next door to our room (and told them it was bio-hazard and they asked me to put it in a separate place\u2026 nice protocol). So then we left and the room was just a little bit stinky but really not that bad considering. Descartes put out coffee grounds in glasses from our bar service figuring if it can help drug dealers hide the smell of dope, surely it could help one small family with a stinky room... as it turns out you should just spray sunscreen spray.. Hell, that smell covers everything and permeates your clothing through a few washes even once you are home... ahh but I digress. So Descartes and I cleaned everything up, cleaned up the kid, and popped open the door between the rooms again. We left  to the spa  in desperate need of some pampering. It was amazing . Really. Very, very spendy, but worth it. Then sitting on the lanai at the spa I just thought... this is so, so nice. I love my husband, my children are being well-cared for and we are out and about during the day by ourselves.. a true rarity for many adults with kids.. somehow it is okay to go out at night, but God forbid we spend time without them, as a couple, during daylight. Then we got back to our room. The first words out of my brother's mouth... \"Thanks for leaving the door open Jennyalice, now our room smells like shit too. Dude, you guys need to buy some candles.\" I apologized. I pulled both of my kids out of my brother's room (where they had been playing, Jake against the sliding glass door, tapping and Lucy playing with Bubsy and both nannies.) I closed the door between the rooms.  I paid the nanny and said good bye to that little 20-something year old.  I called housekeeping and begged for someone to come clean the floor. I started to cry.  My brother's room didn't smell like shit because of the accident earlier. It was because Jake was sitting in a shitty diaper. A ripe, been-there-since-my parents-left, stuck on and rotting his skin with poo-acid type of dirty diaper. Probably explains why the little Nanny-girl said \"He was sort of agitated the whole time, but he was okay.\" It is amazing how quickly 2.5 hours of relaxation and massage can be nearly wiped away.

I made a home made chicken pot pie while the power was still on this morning..as it turns out we never lost power and the chicken pie fell into the category of \"Uhm, you don't need to make that again honey.\" Jake went out the dog door during a very, very bad bout of rain (while I was changing my shirt..he's that fast). I had to chase him on the deck and bring his wet self back in. Oddly enough, even though we bathe him every single night he still smelled more like wet dog than our dogs do. I changed my shirt again. Lucy emptied the dog food all over the kitchen floor. Luckily it is dry food that had been placed in freshly washed bowls.. but I still think that CPS would not approve of \"Chicken Soup for the Soul Adult Dog Food\" as a healthy snack for children (again Jake is very quick). Lucy climbed over the side of her crib and came back upstairs refusing to take a nap. I got a migraine and threw up. While I was throwing up Lucy got a ball point pen off of the counter and drew all over part of her face (by accident I think.. she was trying to put the lid on and had the lid in her mouth.. hmm do you think  she is copying mommy much?) While I was throwing up our larger Golden Retriever Chandler (he came with the name from Retriever Rescue.. and yes it is short for Chandler Bing) decided that he finally would deal with the rain and go outside to pee..only I had closed the gate so no one would escape anywhere while I was yakking...so instead.... oh yes, he did.. he PEED ALL OVER THE KITCHEN FLOOR! Do you have any idea how much liquid a golden retriever bladder can hold? Well it is enough to cover a 10x12 (or so) kitchen and the stairs that lead to the back door. I began to mop? wipe? hose down? saturate with spic and span? the kitchen floor. I paused and called Descartes to give him an update on where our family was for the day. Descartes came home in remarkable time considering that half of the streets in our town are flooded. He also picked up all of our recycling bins that had floated/been wind-gusted down the street. Descartes convinced Lucy to take a nap while Jake played quietly in his room so daddy could work and mommy could take a nap. I slept for 1 hour and 45 minutes..migraine gone. We fed the kids and did bath time..except Jake was in a pissy mood and decided to kick his sister so he went into the shower while Lucy took a bath. Jake refused to get out of the shower, and while I was dealing with him Lucy pooped in the tub. Fanfuckingtastic! Children eventually went to bed, tub got bleached and beers have been cracked. Lucy has only hopped out of bed once since she went down an hour ago. Big girl bed will be purchased tomorrow.

She is one of those women with whom I feel so close, I sometimes forget that I am not just talking to myself (she is very tolerant of my ramblings). She knows all sorts of things about me. For example: I do not like cats. I think it is great if other people want to love cats, I don't want to strip anyone of their rights to love whomever or whatever they so choose, but just don't  make  me love your cat.. and please do NOT start collecting them if you find yourself suddenly without a spouse. In my opinion there should never be more cats than people in a household, more fish possibly, but more cats...no. I don't think this makes me such a bad person.  AND\u00a0 not to make excuses, but I do possibly have a minor allergy to cats....I do not have  Ailurophobia . Oh wow, here's a gem I just found: \"Historical records suggest that a number of infamous people have suffered from  Ailurophobia , including: \u00a0 Alexander the Great   Genghis Khan   Hitler   Julius Caesar   Mussolini Napoleon is also often cited as a cat- phobe , but there appears to be no historical evidence to back this up. Cat lovers often point to the list of supposed  Ailuro phobic  dictators to back up claims that those who are not fond of cats have many other unappealing qualities.\"\u00a0 Great, now I am Mussolini (that's what Descartes and I say on really, significantly bad days at our house...one of us must have been Hitler and the other Mussolini.. though neither of us really believe in reincarnation). So my relationship with cats is fairly well known... which is why this is the best mug on the planet. It could only have been made better if had come with a balloon tied to the handle or if it were filled with a) a heavily scented musky candle or b)Hershey kisses. A small teddy bear holding the mug would also have been appreciated, but any of those additions would really have been a waste of money, whereas I will actually use this mug. Really. \u00a0 Now my sister has said before, \" Uhm ,  Jennyalice , don't you think that's it a little bit f* cked  up that your friends nearly try to out do  each other  with the purchase of trinkets and such that they just KNOW you are going to hate?\" but I see it exactly opposite of that.

I always ask, \"Where do they go the bathroom?\" when watching things like balloon races, around the world plane tours, small boat regattas, and Times Square on New Year's Eve. If I say \"I love you.\" I mean it, even if I say it often and seemingly to many people. I cried while watching the John Adams mini-series on HBO...several times.

{"date": "04 March, 2009", "body": "\nWho knows if Jake *really* has pink eye, but his little lid is tender and his eyes are both a bit bloodshot. Allergies are here again so I would normally attribute eye puffiness to that but given the two cases of pink eye in Jake's class, I am guessing it really is  conjunctivitis . Lovely. and so Jake is giving me stink eye for about ten minutes following the administration of eye drops. Since I am giving them every two and a half hours, that's a lot of stink eye for one mom. Oh and it's off and on sheeting rain in the back yard, so outdoor play will be very limited. Yeah he is thrilled with me today. Currently he is staring out the guest bedroom window no doubt trying to figure out a way to unlock the window and zip line it to the trellis so as to scamper down the wisteria and hightail it to the back yard so he can sort the rocks out of the flowerbeds.  Lucy is a bit more enamored with me, having just made a batch of bread for the bread machine AND pizza dough (which will not be ready in time for kiddos lunch, and I am certain this will cause a crisis in less than a quarter of an hour.) Then, against the urge of nearly every fiber in my body to do other wise, I gave her a bowl, a cup of flour, a tablespoon of sugar, another of salt, a half of a lemon and a half cup of water, oh, and an empty spice container. She also has her little pink rolling pin and a mat for rolling out dough. I played \"recipe\" with her for awhile until she told me she was going to do the rest by herself. She has been happily making her recipe for nearly ten minutes now without a peep (except for her song which goes something like this \"I'm making my recipe toDAYYYYYY. I'm making a yummy recipe toDAYYYYYYY\").  Jake has had a great week at school, which of course makes me a little distressed. Hmm? Well his aide has not been there this week, and so perhaps it's true that her more punitive versus reward based interaction with Jake is tiring him out and making him less productive in class. I spoke to her a little last week about setting up smaller more attainable goals for Jake. He does not to well with, \"I told you back in the classroom thirty minutes ago that you cannot have a cookie if you don't stand in line when we get to the lunchroom..no cookie for you\". Smaller goals and rewards that are within maybe a ten minute time period provide an opportunity for him to feel success and reward in the present moment, which is where we want him to be. I want to encourage him to interact and achieve.. not that I am not concerned with overarching behavioral issues, or nurturing the idea of long term reward and pay off, but those concepts are bigger and more vague for a kid like Jake. I don't want him rewarded with a cookie every time he hits a switch. AS strange as it may sound given that I have an entire pantry filled with sweets and treats for bribes, I hate food based reward, having had an eating disorder earlier in my life, and believe food should be most often eaten for nutrition and less often tied to emotion. What I want is for Jake to be praised when he lines up in the classroom for lunch, then reminded to stay in line, and praised again when he makes it to the cafeteria. I know, it's dog training. Most child rearing is really the same as animal training, but you can't kennel your kid.  Anywhoo, Jake has been happier because he is only experiencing action and reward. Janet and I both recently realized that there needs to be a bigger conversation with BB, and his happy, productive little self this week has just reinforced that.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2009/03/pink-eye-stink-eye.html", "title": "\nPink Eye Stink Eye\n"},
{"date": "15 April, 2010", "body": "\nShannon  posted today at BlogHer  talking about the dissolution of the dynamic \"Green the Vaccine\" duo  Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy. I am totally with Shannon, that while I am not on board with most anything Jenny McCarthy and her movement spout, I have no desire for any ill-will to befall either of them, (or really any person who is anti-vaccine, or really anyone for that matter).\u00a0 \n \n Shan's focus was more on the myth surrounding the divorce rate in families with special needs children; some say it is as high as 80%.  Mull that one over eh? \n \n \n She interviewed me for the post, and used an excerpt of my response to her query: \n \n \n1) Are your child's special needs a factor in the state of your  marriage? \n \n2) for better or for worse? \n \n \nand my answer is... \n \n ****  \nYes, and while I feel that children change the direction of any  marriage, having a special needs child changes the direction of  everything in your life, and often. \n \n I feel lucky because I got to figure out really  early on that I married the right man, and that I want this marriage to  last my lifetime. We have learned how to be a team, how to give each  other space, how to argue while still taking care of some pretty big or  stinky jobs.  \n \nI do think marriage is harder when you have a special needs kid.  Just finding a babysitter to go to therapy can feel insurmountable, and  where is the money for date night supposed to come from when all of your  dollars seem to be going towards therapy or special shoes, or another  stroller that's even bigger because your kid still can't walk?  Everything is just a little bit harder, fixing dinner, bath time,  childcare, hours you keep at the office versus home; having a special  needs kid impacts the choices you make in every category of your life,  it's not like \"marriage\" could really stand outside of that. \n \nAnd all of these marriages with typical kids that end in divorce?  Sometimes I get angry... sort of like \"wait a minute you have everything  going for you there: health, and typical kids, and no short bus, no 2+  hour IEPs and no wondering whether you are going to drive off the road  because you're so tired because your kid has epic migraines and hasn't  slept in days.\" I think, \"Why is it that  we  are making this work, and  you can't with your simple, easy, carefree life?\" And I know that's not  completely fair, because  every  relationship has its moments, it  just seems we have a lot of things working against us, and we are still  here, together.  \n \nSo it occurs to me that maybe that's  why  we're still here,  or at least part of the reason, aside from really having liked each  other to begin with. Maybe having a special needs kid has cemented our  relationship, in ways that only despair, coupled with a deep abiding love  for our child, could possibly do. \n \nWe have learned how to move through  adversity, together, and we share the same dark, dark, humor, and we  have remembered to laugh. We have figured out, on our worst days, how to  still be good roommates, because we have children to raise, and an  example to set for them. \n \nI don't necessarily recommend  adding  a special needs child to  a marriage to strengthen it, I'm not thinking it works that way, but  for me, for us, we're going to be just fine;  place your bets. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogher.com/did-autism-cleave-jim-carrey-jenny-mccarthy", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S8eSQztjfpI/AAAAAAAACY8/m-0aiAThk7s/s1600/_PAS3685.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/04/you-gotta-know-when-to-hold-em.html", "title": "\nYou Gotta Know When to Hold 'em\n"},
{"date": "23 August, 2010", "body": "\nThis morning I was talking with my friend Pollyanna. We've known each other since our first kids were babies. Jake was less than 6 months old and her daughter was nearly 2 months old. I had specifically chosen a playgroup of first time moms with babies who were younger than Jake. I knew already that something was different about my son, and the longer we could \"look normal\" while I figured out what was wrong, the better. Of course the playgroup was all girls, and they all passed him by in a matter of months, but by that time I had somehow managed to rope in a few women to be my friends, in spite of my different, but beautiful boy. While I don't see all of those women now, I know that in addition to Pollyanna, I could probably call at least two of them right now and they would help me if they could. It was, for the most part, a great group of people.  \n \nSo, of course our first children are all the same age, and should be going into the same grades, etc. When I was talking with Pollyanna, I had to ask what grade her daughter was going into. Perhaps if I were a better friend, I would know these things, but mostly, I realized, I should know because my son should be going into the same grade, or it should be close, maybe he should be in the grade above hers. I should be at least as accurate as to be within 2 years...and I had no idea; just couldn't come up with it without asking, or starting to do some math, or counting all of Jake's teachers, which would just put me in a dark place because I am  still not over kindergarten . \n \nAnd while my conversation was such a nice welcome home after  so many days away from my community , my tribe, after I hung up I was melancholy. A piece of my heart, in spite of being so full of joy it could burst, was sad. This has nothing to do with Pollyanna, or either of her beautiful, talented children... in fact I should celebrate the problem I have... I will never need to worry about what grade Jake is going into ever again; as long as he stays at WunderSkool, it will never matter. He may change classrooms, and certainly, at eighteen or so he will switch to the adult program, but as long as he is a part of that program, it just won't matter. All that matters there is his development, his needs, his growth, his happiness; the things that are important. \n \nSo why the frowny face jennyalice? \n \nMarkers, milestones, certification, progress checks... they are those bits of childhood that made our parents proud, or got us grounded. The little slips of paper in the mail from the state, \"Your child is gifted.\" or \"Your child meets the state standards for reading.\" There was the \"N\" for \"needs improvement\" I received erroneously in second grade, right before spring break, which made me lose my sh*t so badly that I cried all the way home on the bus (having looked at my report card even though you weren't supposed to look at it before your parents did...). That little \"N\" made me so upset that my dad, who was somehow home, and not at work, drove me back to school so he could speak with my teacher who thankfully was still there. Those report cards, checking the list on the wall the week before school started to see who your teacher would be, the anticipation of a new desk...shopping for school supplies and back-to-school fashionable clothing purchases... I don't really need to worry about any of that for Jake. None of it.  \n \nI buy clothes in the fall because he normally has grown so much over the summer it's a necessity. I clean out his backpack and lunch box, because they are filthy, but he's been using the same   backpack  and  lunch box  since I put him on that little yellow short bus 7 years ago. He will go to the same classroom, at the same school, for a very long time, and he can't even tell me if he has apprehension about the one new thing he'll have tomorrow... the bus driver. \n \nI'm not grieving really. I'm not feeling all that left out. I just noticed. I noticed that we are different at our house, again. Even in the simplest ways, our house will continue to run differently than other houses with kids the same age. And while we will go through many of these little things with Jake's little sister, we aren't racing to Target today to get Jake a pencil case, and some wide-ruled paper.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jennyalice.blogspot.com/2005/06/oh-cry-me-riverits-just-kindergarten.html", "http://www.haveautismwilltravel.blogspot.com/", "http://www.landsend.com/pp/StylePage-383755_A5.html?CM_MERCH=REC-_-FPPP-_-GGT-_-1-_-383755-_-383758", "http://www.landsend.com/pp/ClassMateStudyHaulLunchBox-79759_198916_-1.html?cm_mmc=Froogle-_-null-_-FP-_-data_feed"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/08/whos-your-teacher.html", "title": "\nWho's Your Teacher?\n"},

{"date": "29 April, 2010", "body": "\n \n \n Jake as a little guy at Disneyland late at night \n \n We used to spend a LOT of money developing pictures. Capturing Jake on film required expert photography skills combined with the fastest shutter speed and endless rolls of film. It took money,\u00a0 patience and diligence and perseverance, and faith, and will, and cooperation and effort.  \n \n \n \n so little \n At some point I lost all of those things. and I began to let go of the idea of ever having a \"real\" family photo. I stopped trying to take a picture of Jake doing normal every day activities. I saved my strength for holiday photos. \n \nThen we got a digital camera, a nice one.  \n \nand we started all over again. And we figured out that it wasn't just about the latest technology, or spending the most money, or getting leg cramps, or making sure Jake's shirt was clean. \n \n \n \n preschool graduation day \n We have a child with autism. We have a child with autism  and  cerebral palsy,  and  some panic issues  and  some migraine issues  and  some sleep issues  and  God only knows what else. And one of his \"issues\", or skills, or (dis)abilities, is avoiding a camera lens, or at the very least he won't tolerate a camera with a person behind it. The reason we had a hard time getting a good picture of Jake wasn't really about us not trying hard enough, or not caring enough, it was just a part of having this special needs kid. \n \n \n \n Lucy was still being talked about in weeks in this photo \n and I cannot help it, it makes me sad. I want to not want that \"beautiful family in white cotton sitting in a field\" photo.\u00a0 I want to not really care that there seems nothing suitable to frame and give a grandparent as a gift at the holidays... or the looming Mother's Day. I want to not notice other families' adorned tabletops and hallways, lined with school photos, each one a masterpiece, a moment in time framed and hung for all to see the missing tooth, the self-styled bangs, the galliwampus shirt collar. \n \nWe don't really have those moments. My sister is a photographer by trade, my husband has captured amazing pictures, and many of the rest of the family are prolific in our clicking so as to produce at least some good shots if only by the grace of statistics...and still we cannot capture him. When we do get a shot, it is never with a straight on look. I just do not ever get to really look at my own son. Not since he was an infant, when, as irony often deposits itself into my life, my son demanded  constant  eye contact or he would fuss and fuss; he was so intense, and I would just stare at him for hours. \n \n \n \n Jake at Dream Machines \n What I would give for just one hour with those eyes again. I tried this weekend when we went to the Dream Machines event on the coast, to capture him, and his joy. I sat beneath him, next to his wheelchair (which we used for most of the day since there was so much walking and possibility of getting run over by, oh, I don't know, A Monster Truck). \nI told him I wanted to take his picture and he started to laugh, and put his hands out in front of him, so I put myself to the side and just put the camera near him, which was funnier to him, but harder for him to avoid. \n \n \n \n Jake thinks I am hilarious \n I realized another thing as I was clicking furiously, knowing that I would need to delete 80 or 100 photos for every one I found that was worth viewing. I realized that Descartes' younger sister hates to be photographed, and Descartes doesn't really like it all that much either. This is foreign to me, since I grew up in a family of narcissists (and I say that in the nicest way, my dear siblings). I don't remember ever being shy for a camera unless I was in a bathing suit, or wearing the fat suit of adulthood. We hammed it up, and leapt in front of each other and put on tin foil hats or dramatic big, poofy, curled hair just to be seen. \n \nSo perhaps there's another dynamic I hadn't thought of before, one that isn't so tragic and dramatic. Perhaps Jake just doesn't want his picture taken and is being a pain in the but like any kid who doesn't want to make a nice smile or stand still or wipe their face for a photo. Maybe he is just different than Lucy in a very normal way. She is a dancer, an orator; she poses, and waits for the shot. Maybe it's okay that he watches, and laughs, but keeps his distance from center stage.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S9pPfssrigI/AAAAAAAACZw/K3dUU0OYC58/s1600/CIMG0419.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S9pPJKrCbXI/AAAAAAAACZo/ITVtWj2PDho/s1600/012_9A.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S9pVVMPQnYI/AAAAAAAACaA/xvl6djDFT_w/s1600/DSC_0045.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S9pP1iGeS3I/AAAAAAAACZ4/dxIiwqWCzAs/s1600/jackandkate.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S9pO7i9y_hI/AAAAAAAACZg/bnQXP2bq8bw/s1600/P4255879.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/S9pOn--4Q9I/AAAAAAAACZY/WnTuWPkuXYw/s1600/P4255874.JPG"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/04/kodachrome.html", "title": "\nKodachrome\n"},

{"date": "12 October, 2010", "body": "\n earlier this morning... \n \n Most of you would not be surprised to know that I have a lot to say. A LOT to say, but lately I think I have so much to say that I can\u2019t get anything out, which is extremely frustrating because my mind is getting very full. \n Well, apparently it just takes a little jump-start, because I am so upset right now I am shaking. And when I am this upset, I feel the need to write. \n I was just in a store, and a little boy, not even three, walked right outside and onto the street. He opened the front door and walked out onto one of the busiest corners in our downtown. I caught what was happening just as I got to the register, and watched as the very sweet cashier, who is probably not older than 20, raced outside. I knew exactly what she was doing without even seeing what she was rushing after.\u00a0 I guessed it was the little boy because I had already brought him back to his mother three times in the ten minutes I had been in the store. \n Twice I turned him around and said \"Go back to Momma.\u201d while nudging him in the right direction, since I could see her from where I was. And the third time I actually took him by the hand and walked him back to her. She never looked up from what she was doing when I brought him back. Kids might wander a bit down the aisle you're on, but he was so sad and looking for her, \"Momma, Maaaaaaamaaaaaa?\", and so short he couldn't find her in the maze of boxes and displays. \n When the cashier brought the little boy through the door I thanked her profusely. She smiled and I took the little boy by the hand and marched to the back of the store to his mother. She picked him up this time, but didn't say anything to me.  \n Life is hard. For a lot of people, life is very hard, so I am not going to judge the woman too harshly because Lord only knows what has happened thus far in her life, but based on her smooth appearance and lack of tear-stained cheeks, and her desire to look at Christmas ornaments, I am guessing not much tragedy had befallen her this morning. Her other child was at one of the display tables with a bag of candy from the store ripped open in front of her. \n I told the mom that her son had gotten outside and that the young cashier had chased after him down the street. She just looked at him and said \u201cWhy did you go outside?\u201d and that was it...I was so surprised by her lack of concern, that I started to think maybe I was making a bigger deal out of it than I should, so I just said, \u201cI thought you\u2019d want to know because he is strong enough now, to open up a heavy store door and get outside by himself. Maybe that\u2019s a new skill?\u201d She said nothing to me, so I turned around and walked back to the cashier. \n I paid for my items and realized I was very upset. I was trying to figure out all of the emotion I was having. I thanked the cashier about 60 million more times... for paying attention, for doing more than her job, for making sure that woman didn\u2019t have anything horrible happen to her today, for saving that boy\u2019s life, because surely with the parking garage and the giant trucks, and the busy, busy light with a turn-right-on-the-green-arrow light, and the boy's lack of safety awareness, he would have been hurt in a matter of minutes. The young lady was so gracious, just saying that she didn\u2019t think he should be out there on his own. She told me to have a good day, and gave me my bag. My hand was shaking. \n I realized I was very angry. Sweaty palms, gonna lose it, shaking, sick to my stomach, angry. \n Watching my son is a full-time job at home and in public.

It's something we are trying very, very hard to master because it's very important that he stay with me, and we have the same expectation of our typical kid, because it's important that kids stay with their parents. Right? and this lady just let her kid, her typical, able-to-talk, able-to-hear, knows-his-own name, walks-without-aide, child walk out of the store. He just walked out of the store, and it took someone bringing him back for her to notice he was missing. \n I'm not one for saying \"that's not fair.\" because no one promises us that life will be fair, or even, or equitable, or easy, but I found myself saying it anyway.\u00a0 \n It's not fair. It's not fair...I try so hard every single day not to be a burden to others, to make sure my children are not causing problems for any one else but me. Jake tries so hard to keep it together in stores. We leave restaurants when either kid is having a hard time, we leave stores and abandon carts when there is a meltdown. We do not lose our children in stores. Our family works hard every time we go out, the whole time, to do the right thing, and she, she just lets her kid all the way through an entire huge store and out the door....and doesn't even say thank you when he's found alive?\u00a0 \n **********  I am re-reading this 7 hours later, and I still have all those feelings, but another one has crept in...that feeling I get when I realize I am not being grateful. I wish sometimes my personality would allow for just appreciating that the child was safely returned to his mother, and not feel like I have a moral imperative to change the world and the way people think, or get them to think when they are obviously not thinking. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/10/jump-start.html", "title": "\nJump Start\n"},

{"date": "21 December, 2010", "body": "\nWe're happy around here. Vacation for the kids has begun. Descartes is taking some time off. We'll see family, and snow, and the beach, and most of our Great State as we traipse up and down in our all-wheel-drive van. If you ever buy a Toyota Sienna... pay extra for the AWD. It is so awesome to drive right up and through those chain control check points. \n \nWe had Thanksgiving at our house this year. My Tahoe family came down and Descartes' parents came across the bridge, and we had a lovely, lovely day. My sister made most of the food, or maybe she didn't, but since she brought food from Tahoe, beautiful home-made food, and then she helped me here, I think she did most of the work. Descartes' parents were precious with the kids, of course, and they had fun decorating the Turkey Lurkey cake.\u00a0 This was not a tradition I had growing up, but it is a great way to entertain the kids, especially right before dinner is served when every one is antsy. In our family you frost a chocolate sheet cake (okay Descartes' mother does all of this...) and you let the children coat the entire thing in candy, with the goal that the cake look something like the Turkey it was cut out to be. It's really gross, and awesome, and sickeningly sweet. The tradition we have added with this generation is that I let the kids eat a piece of that cake for breakfast the next day. I love being that kind of bad mom. \n \nThere's lots of  new  lately. Mostly things look the same, and certainly to the untrained eye, to an outsider who doesn't notice the nuances of our life, nothing looks different, but there are some great things happening. \n \nLate afternoon on Thanksgiving day, when it came time for us to say goodbye to Cookie and Papa, Jake was very upset as we shut the kitchen door, and watched them walk away. The little kids wanted to walk the grandparents to the gate, and as I said yes, it occurred to me that Jake probably wanted to go too. So I asked him, and he said, \"Uh ye....ah!\" So Jake went to the gate. The little guys peeled off to play before they even made it down the back steps, but Jake went to the gate and stood there until he saw his grandparent's car drive away. And as the car passed by the gate he raised his hand, a sort of mix between a salute and a wave. And when they had driven off he turned around and walked down the breezeway and back into the house. \n \nRelationship. Social awareness. Understanding family dynamics.  \n \nWe're also seeing something else that seems like no big deal to most families... Jake is beginning to lead people to where\u00a0 he wants to go. He took Descartes' hand and pulled him, gently, towards the door in Tahoe because he so desperately wanted to go outside. He took Squid's daughter Iz's hand and walked her around the entire bounce house party. He took Uncle Jaster's hand and led him to the door (once again.. that boy really likes playing outside!) He took my hand just today and led me to the breakfast counter for a snack. \n \nCommunication. Intent. Calm insistence. Proprioceptive awareness. \n \nAnd he's been snuggling. Really snuggling, on the couch, in the bed, and nuzzling in when we give him a hug. This month we've spent at least two rainy days snuggled on the couches in the living room, watching his favorite show MythBusters, or a movie. It might make us a lazy family, but we are trying to let Jake lead. I watched almost all of The Princess and the Frog with Jake at one end of he couch, and me at the other, or feet snuggling and twisting under the blanket. And just this weekend he took a rest with his head on a pillow between Descartes' and mine, for almost 40 minutes. He had one arm around his dad's arm and his other around my shoulders. We were closer to him, for a longer than we had been in years- years. \n \nAffection. Preference. Increased attention span. \n \nWe have seen so many little things that amount to such big long term changes. He has been happy and healthy and present, and it has been wonderful. In this season of thanksgiving, I could not be more grateful.  \n \nWe head out tomorrow to Southern California. The rain should be plentiful, and the food delicious, and seeing family will be wonderful in spite of the obstacles of changing our routine and leaving all of our comfort zones. If nothing else, our family loves a good road trip. Although there is one other thing Jake has been doing lately...bugging his little sister. Very normal brother-sister teasing: sneaking a single cookie out of her bowl when she walks away, taking her doll in the car, and laughing when she throws a fit, or tapping her arm until she gives in and shares her snack on a road trip!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/12/lead-me-to-gate.html", "title": "\nLead me to the Gate\n"},
{"date": "13 October, 2010", "body": "\nIt is my sister's birthday next week, so while she was visiting this weekend, in between the reveling and the  beer-making , and the  beer-drinking  and the  concert-going , I made her a cake. \n \nA few of her favorite foods in life are mayonnaise, chocolate and apparently  Bordeaux chocolates from See's Candies ..that last one I actually didn't know about when I chose which cake to make her, but this cake sort of managed to hit all those sweet spots.  \n \nI remembered that I had read about a World War II era cake that used mayo instead of eggs and shortening because as two of you may recall, and a few more of you may have read.. there was rationing during the war...back when people actually had to sacrifice some of their personal luxury for the benefit of a greater good...but I digress. \n \n Wikipedia  tells us \"Tires  were the first item to be rationed in January 1942 after supplies of  natural rubber were interrupted. Soon afterward, passenger automobiles, typewriters, sugar, gasoline, bicycles, footwear, fuel oil, coffee, stoves, meat, lard, shortening and oils, cheese, butter, margarine, processed foods (canned, bottled, and frozen), dried fruits, canned milk, firewood and coal, jams, jellies, and fruit butter were rationed by November 1943.\" \n \nAnd since necessity breeds ingenuity, the bakers, really, the women of that generation, found new ways to make their cakes..voila... the delicate deliciousness of this cake was born. \n \nThis recipe comes from  America's Best Lost Recipes: 121 Heirloom Recipes Too Good to Forget  in which I have found several great recipes, for obscure and once well-loved foods like Runsas, which are also called  Bierock  which my family loved. \n \n    World War II Chocolate Mayonnaise Cake  (all italics are my own notes) \n Ingredients \n Cake  \n2 cups all-purpose flour \n1/4 cup Dutch-processed cocoa powder \n1 teaspoon baking powder \n1 teaspoon baking soda \n1 cup mayonnaise \n1 cup granulated sugar \n1 teaspoon vanilla extract \n1 cup water \n \n \n \n Frosting\u00a0 \n (I doubled the amount of butter, brown sugar and milk, and used 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar to make my frosting, because we always like more frosting. I think if I had used the entire amount of powdered sugar it would have been too stiff.) \n4 tablespoons unsalted butter \n1/2 cup packed light brown sugar \n2 tablespoons milk \n1 cup confectioner's sugar \n \n Directions Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350   degrees   F. Grease and flour a 9-inch square baking pan.  (Because you make this in a 9x9 pan you can actually use your counter top (toaster) oven to make this cake, thus avoiding heating up the entire kitchen!) \n \n  Whisk the flour, cocoa, baking powder and baking soda in a medium bowl.  \n \n   Stir the mayonnaise, granulated sugar, and vanilla together in a large  bowl until smooth. Add the water and stir until combined. Whisk in the  flour mixture until incorporated.  \n \n  Scrape the batter into the  prepared pan  (you can actually let kids lick the spatula here without worry since the eggs in the mayonnaise have already been cooked! A great cake to make with little kids! ) and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out  clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool completely in the pan, at least 45  minutes.  (Many people leave this cake in the pan and frost it there. I flipped mine upside-down onto a serving platter before frosting it so it would look more birthday-ish and less Grandma VanZanten Poor-Man's Cake-ish..but let me tell you Grandma VanZanten's cake was AWESOME!) \n \n  ***** \n For the frosting, melt the butter in a small saucepan  over medium-high heat. Stir in the brown sugar and bring to a boil. Boil  until the mixture begins to thicken, about 2 minutes, then, off the  heat, carefully stir in the milk.  \n \n  Return to a boil, then remove from the heat to cool until just warm, about 30 minutes. \n \n   Stir in the confectioner's sugar and spread the icing evenly over the  cake. The cake can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.  (if it lasts that long!) \n \n Enjoy!  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://morebeer.com/search/103660/beerwinecoffee/coffeewinebeer/Los_Altos_Showroom", "http://www.gourmethausstaudt.com/", "http://www.ktvu.com/entertainment/25310810/detail.html", "http://www.sees.com/prod.cfm/Dark_Chocolates/Dark_Chocolate_Bordeaux", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing#United_States", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933615184?ie=UTF8&tag=jennyalice-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1933615184", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bierock", "http://draft.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=6355474"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/10/posted-by-popular-demand-cake.html", "title": "\nPosted By Popular Demand: Cake\n"},
{"date": "14 August, 2010", "body": "\nI'm having such a  great time on our trip . It's really amazing to me how diverse the land...and the people are in this great country. I may be liberal, but the conservatives can't steal my love of country or my ability to display the flag at my house, though you probably won't finding me with a flag lapel pin any time soon. I love this country, and my heart swells with pride when I think about how lucky I am to have been born here, and had the ability to have an education, and marry the person I wanted to marry. Knowing I can raise my children with clean water, and an abundance of food,\u00a0 instilling our family's take on religion without persecution. And we can travel freely from place to place, without fear. It is truly a privilege to live here. \n \n Visiting Washington, D.C., looking at all of the monuments to some of the greatest community builders the world has ever seen, makes me weepy. Our first President, George Washington, leading a group of disparate people in unity to help build our country. Abraham Lincoln, who held the country together, when slavery, and economics nearly shredded the fabric of the new nation beyond repair. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, seeing clearly that each person had value, and as a society we have a moral obligation to take care of each other, a concept that presses upon me as a parent of a special needs child who will always be on the receiving end of society's beneficence. \n \nThe amount of leadership and personal integrity those people must have displayed is astounding. I've already mentioned how moved I was by the  John Adams series , and the personality traits it brought to light for us all these years later. I think anytime I see great leadership, or community building I am moved. BlogHer'10 gave me some great moments, especially watching Lisa Stone, an amazing community builder herself,\u00a0 interview the the International Activist Blogger Scholarship recipients. \n \nThe speakers: \n Dushiyanthini Kanagasabapathipillai , Sri Lanka, publisher of  Humanity Ashore \nEsra'a Al Shafei, Bahrain , publisher at  www.mideastyouth.com \n Freshta Basij-Rasikh , Afghanistan, writer for the  Afghan Women's Writing Project \n  Marie Trigona , Argentina, publisher of  Latin American Activism I was especially excited to hear  Esr'a Al Shafei speak with such passion. I think my favorite quote was.  \"If you're going to piss a lot of people off you better do it very well.\"  Which is exactly what the founding framers of this great nation did when they cleaved our future nation from the Crown. \n \n \n \n \n myBoy at the FDR memorial in Washington, D.C. \n It  was an honor to hear those women speak, and a great feeling to be a  part of BlogHer. I've met many wonderful women, who are now part of my  community, my little world of Special Needs, and the advocacy and  activism that come with it.\u00a0 \n \n And while I'm not saying that the International speakers are in the same exact same category as Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt, in many ways they are. They are trying to make unheard voices heard, finding a way for their needs to be given credence. They are sewing up differences between religions and cultures, and encouraging a fresh perspective on old topics. And with their work, so important, and probably unappreciated for many years, they are reminding us to value the least of us, and to honor the best in us.\u00a0 \n \n ******\u00a0 \n I do hope you're following us along on our cross country adventure.  http://www.haveautismwilltravel.blogspot.com \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.haveautismwilltravel.blogspot.com/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TGbOo6uxO1I/AAAAAAAACno/jITz7IRaxvg/s1600/fdr.jpg", "http://www.hbo.com/john-adams/index.html", "http://www.humanityashore.org/", "http://www.mideastyouth.com/", "http://www.awwproject.org/", "http://www.mujereslibres.blogspot.com/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4xLYnj1CyLc/TGgBUyFFCII/AAAAAAAACnw/noJziEO0tsA/s1600/P8056275.JPG", "http://www.haveautismwilltravel.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2010/08/this-is-my-country.html", "title": "\nThis is My Country\n"},

The worst sound may be my son's silent moan with tears, but I haven't heard that in a while...a long blessed while.  \n \n But we have had some tears this week.\u00a0 \n \n Yesterday Lucy sort of just lost it on the way to school. She had eaten a balanced breakfast, had enough sleep, and because she was actually being a good listener (and mommy had enough sleep the night before too), we had not had any of the usual morning squabbling over shoes-on, hair brushing etc. So we get out the door, into the car and began our race to the freeway (with the cruise control at the speed limit). She started to cry.\u00a0 \n \n Looking into the rear view mirror I was so afraid it was going to be a faker, whiny, brat, cry baby that I steeled myself for the barrage of mean things I would need to force back down my throat, because, after all she is only four, and still learning how to ask for what she needs.\u00a0 \n \n What I saw, instead of a bratty little monster, was the saddest little girl I've ever seen.

She can already happily stay at a sleep over for 24 hours without more than a 5 minute check in on the phone.\u00a0 \n \n As much as I love how independent and strong she is growing, I know that part of the reason she is okay when I'm not around, is because she knows I really am here. I tend to think that if we don't give our kids that feeling like they know how very deeply they are loved...every day, well, I think some of those kids stick around too long waiting to hear it.

You are harder for me to help when you can't walk all the way on your own, and I can't carry you anymore; not with all of those long legs and arms.

I'm always kissing you, and I know you didn't need to kiss me, but I asked, and you gave.  \n \n You have a new willingess to do some of those things outside your comfort zone. Share space, be held. You hold my hand now, you reach for it, and though I know I am gripping you for safety, I also know that we are holding hands by choice too. Curling up on the couch, sharing a blanket, you are learning to rest. Those things are hard to do when you are so used to moving constantly.

{"date": "25 July, 2013", "body": "\n \nIt's our 15th wedding anniversary today, and sitting here in this beautiful hotel room in Chicago, I can't help but think that I am the luckiest girl in the world to have my particular spouse... who is back in California minding after our home, our children, and his work. \n \nI knew when I said yes to come to BlogHer this year, that my desire to be a part of the conference would put us apart on our anniversary, and though I asked Descartes if it was okay that I spend our family dollars for me to attend, I wasn't at all troubled by the fact that we would miss being together on the actual day of our anniversary. \n \nAnd maybe that's why we are still a whole and functioning marriage after all these years? Maybe being able to roll with it,\u00a0 maybe that's how we will make it another 35 years after this, and perhaps meet the milestone that his parents just passed. And maybe we will make it several more years after that if there is enough good fortune for us to have each other then too. \n \nI am respectful of milestones; they march us through time, and help us take note of how much has been accomplished, how much there is yet to be done, but I have learned over these years, of marriage and parenting, that it is more important that I mark each morning with thankfulness for a full house of health, for a roof over our heads, for milk in the fridge, and to be at peace each night with the comfort of knowing the head that lies next to mine spins its wheels with how to care for me, and our family, as much as it seeks rest from having put those plans into action. \n \nOur marriage isn't balanced on one day a year with red roses and champagne, though I will probably drink some today anyway. If we held it all up for one day a year to be thankful, to show our love, to announce to the world how great our life is together, I doubt we'd have made it this far. Relying on one day to sustain you for 364 more is asking too much of one dinner date. And flowers cut from their vine don't last more than a week, so what then of the other 51? I told him from the beginning, I would rather you love me every day, than try to make up for it once a year.  \n \nI didn't worry about being gone for our anniversary because I know how much he loves me on any given Tuesday, or Thursday, or last week. He shows it in the way he calls on his way home from work, a gentle reminder that it may be nearing the dinner hour if I haven't yet thought about what to feed the masses. I can hear it in his messages to me, in the notes about jobs he thinks I might like, or places we should visit together, and in the swift reply, \"Yes!\" when we ask him to meet us at the park.  \n \nHe puts away the ladder, the paint brush, the hammer, the duct tape, the everything-I-left-out, without berating me for walking away from an unfinished project, always giving me the benefit of the doubt, that something more urgent must have come up. \n \nHe let's me, be me, as loud and brassy as I often am, even as I am trying to be a little less dramatic.\u00a0 He draws out my humor and sets the stage for me, because he knows how I love to make people laugh.  \n \nWe have inside jokes too complicated to explain, and share a dark humor, having waded through the piles of life we could not have anticipated. He accepts my need to plan for the worst, and for however often he has expected me to 'suck it up,' he has always held me when I needed it. He expects me to be strong, but knows when to put his hand at my back, and whisper, \"Let's get you out of here.\" He chooses me to be a part of his adventures, and he fills our life with plenty of them.  \n \nHe does the right thing, every time. Every. Time. And he is a good man--he is trustworthy, kind, and I've never met a child who didn't like him...and babies know about these things. He even eats leftovers. \n \nHe is a cornerstone.  \n \nI cannot predict our future; the possibilities ahead seem just as implausible as where we have been, but I know that I am thrilled to see his face when he walks through the door each evening, and melt when he wrestles our children amid a pile of pillows. I look forward to date night like it's the first\u00a0 time he's ever asked me out, and savor the feeling of being seated beside him in the car, undecided about where to go or what to do--As long as I am with him, everything else is going to work out just fine. It's true. Just watch.  \n \nIt's more than I thought I'd have. For every young vision I had of my future, this part, my marriage, this man, it's more than I thought I'd have. More depth, more laughter, more big ideas, more feelings... it's more fun than I imagined. \n \n \nCheers to you my precious husband. Cheers to us, and what we've built and sustained. May we have so many more years together that we forget each other's names. \n \nYou can just call me \"dear,\" and hold my hand. \n \n \n \n \n You're my back bone. \nYou're my cornerstone. \nYou're my crutch when my legs stop moving. \nYou're my head start. \nYou're my rugged heart. \n \n ...  \n \n And long after you're gone, gone, gone. \nI'll love you long after you're gone, gone, gone.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Phillip Phillips  - Gone Gone Gone -\u00a0 Live NY PS 22\n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogger.com/null"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2013/07/its-thursday-and-im-in-love.html", "title": "\nIt's Thursday and I'm in Love\n"},

{"date": "29 January, 2010", "body": "\nIt doesn't happen often that I am asleep for enough hours in a row to dream, but last night I got there. Unfortunately my only dreams were those of unvaccinated children, and sickness and rallies and something about a huge \"pile of advocacy\" that I was responsible for sorting and re-building properly so we could all climb to the top. Yeah, very restful. After  the news yesterday  that the General Medical Council found Andrew Wakefield \"had acted 'dishonestly and irresponsibly' in doing his research.\" My stomach just sort of kept churning. You see, this just means more children will go unvaccinated and be exposed to horrible diseases, and it means I have more work to do. Anyone who does not believe that vaccines caused their child's autism has even more work to do now, because Wakefield just got more air time. Andrew Wakefield's unethically performed project now has another platform to do damage, because his supporters are loud and they have a passion that is untethered to reality. In the face of science and studies and information, they cling to anecdotal evidence, and if they are threatened with truth they do not calmly listen or examine where their logic may be false. Instead they insult people (like my brilliant friend Kristina), or they leave nasty notes here on my blog, and on other advocates pages. With Wakefield in the news, the media will go round and round  again  about \"the controversy\" of vaccines ( like that news guy I used to like Matt Lauer ).   The Age of Autism herd, Jenny McCarthy and her McAutism clan  have more things to set on fire now. All of Wakefield's supporters will just add this to the list of \"big pharma\" and \"government\" keeping us all in the dark, harming children on purpose. They must come to his defense  because  the truth  would be too painful and would undo their entire existence. So now I need to push more for real help for families affected by Autism. I am not going to say I am on the \"other side\" because I fight for those people's children too and for all those children who are \"healed\" but still need a full-time aide. I don't want there to be sides, I want all of our children to get the help they need now. I want families to have the support they need, and I want my child to have a place to live when he's grown and I am gone. So it's back to work. Here you can  sign the petition  to encourage First Lady Michelle Obama to meet with Autism Families because when Wakefield's bogus findings show up on the news, monies are swayed away toward vaccine/autism \"research\" instead of helping actual families. and don't get me wrong, I am very glad Wakefield was officially, and for public record, found to be unethical. After reading through most of the  143 page document , it is clear that he went rogue and did not act in the best interest of those children. But because of this statement: The Panel wish to make it clear that this case is not concerned with whether there is or might be any link between the  MMR  vaccination and autism. I will be most happy when his name can slip off the front pages and we can all get back to the business of caring for our children.

{"date": "01 June, 2011", "body": "\n I struggled to make the story more compelling to the parent of one of my daughter\u2019s friends. He\u2019s a kind man with two typical children, who asked me about Jake without any pity in his voice. (I hear that voice quite often, and it\u2019s something I have come to understand, but still find hard to get over.) His was more of a genuine query about a child who isn\u2019t often the \u201cplus-one sibling\u201d at the 5 year old birthday jumpy house affairs.  \n \u201cI handed him a piece of tomato, and asked him not to drop it on the ground. I told him that if he did not want the tomato he could just hand it back to me.\u201d I continued, feeling again that warm sensation of pride in my son, \u201cHe stopped, pivoted slightly and handed me the tomato, crossing mid-line, uh, going across his body, to give it back to me.\" The man smiled, and nodded his head, and looked like he really wanted to understand the significance of what I was saying.  \n And of course he couldn\u2019t really understand why I stood there in the kitchen with a tomato in my hand, and tears in my eyes. Such a simple task, I\u2019m surprised he had the patience for me to finish telling the story at all. But I know the importance, because for what I think is the first time in my son\u2019s 10.5 year-old life, he followed a direction, in the moment, and made a physical connection with me, purposefully, and he had nothing to gain from his actions. We\u2019ve come close, with a sippy-cup dropped into my hand, or rolled down the counter near me when he wanted more to drink, but this time he really put something into my palm, and he had to make a choice to do it\u2026 I wasn\u2019t on the way, and there was no reward, no benefit at all. That unwanted tomato could just as easily have been dropped to the ground. He was even headed towards the back door to play outside, a preferred activity for just about any child, but he stopped and gave me back the piece of tomato, calmly and politely. \n It is amazing how much joy we have watching him continue to learn and make progress in these seemingly benign ways; these subtle acts that he keeps adding to his repertoire. It leads us to believe that he is processing information in new ways, able to parse the language and make all the \u201choles line up.\u201d And if he can hear and process and act on what he sees or hears, that means there is more possibility for him to be able to communicate his needs to us. And better communication means a more connected boy, and a life with less challenges. Like most parents, watching our children succeed is a fantastic double whammy; we get to see our children be happy, and we get to know that the hard work of raising children is paying off. \n What I didn\u2019t tell the daddy in the park were the next things that went through my mind. Because even as I stood there in the kitchen, the glow of pure joy, excitement and pride washing over me, pressing me to call every grandparent, those next thoughts went something like, \u201cOh my God, we are totally screwed.\u201d After I exhaled the joy, I was filled with a paralyzing fear that we are never going to catch up, and there is so much more work to do. He handed me a stupid tomato, it\u2019s not like he got the top score in his math class, or figured out a better way to extract rare earth elements. Jake\u2019s home-aide squeezed me and let me know how cool it was to witness the new skill, and all I could wonder is if he would ever have enough self-help skills to be anything close to independent. Is he destined to rely on other people for every part of his life? I mourned that we have missed the window of opportunity. The plasticity disappearing in his brain, those neural pathways becoming fixed, fearing that moments like these will be farther and farther apart, and there are so many things he still cannot do. As a ten-year old boy I should not be cheering on the simple act of handing me a tomato. He should be skateboarding, and climbing trees in his friend\u2019s back yard. He should be testing the boundaries, and reading Harry Potter or breaking his right arm as he barrel-asses down the slopes on his new snowboard. He should be playing too much Wii, and reading after I\u2019ve told him to go to sleep. He should be asking for a raise in his allowance, and trying to convince his grandparents that the iPad2 is a perfect gift to give a graduating fifth grader.He should be doing so many more things at this age, and there I am pathetically sniffling over a piece of juicy red tomato.  \n Which leads naturally to the third emotions that rang clearly through my brain. First, pride and joy, then fear and sadness, and finally, guilt and shame. I immediately chided myself for comparing my son to some sort of norm; he is incomparable in most respects, to most other children in both deficit and strength. He shouldn\u2019t be doing anything more or less than what he\u2019s doing, and the fact that I let all of those things run through my head meant that I was not present for the child that was standing in my kitchen. My son is not any other child than the one before me, and how he learns and grows and interacts with the world is going to be different than every other child on the planet, autism or not. It\u2019s shameful to dwell on what I thought parenting would be like, what my home would look like, how my children would act, and what they would do to pass the time, and I thought we had long since stopped comparing him to other children his age; it doesn\u2019t do anyone any good to compare. I do not to indulge in the rat hole of \"why me?\" and try not to get side-tracked by the accompanying envy of lives that look easier, simpler, or more carefree. When we keep longing for a life that didn\u2019t happen, or that won\u2019t happen, we lose all those moments of the life we actually have. And I have a great life. \n I tried my best to move my mind back to joy as Jake ran out the back door and I put the tomato in a shallow bowl for him. \n While I sometimes can\u2019t help noting the typical-kid milestones we miss, I am, for the most part, less troubled than I used to be. These days I am more focused on how I can help Jake become the happiest, healthiest child he can be, in the most supportive environment. How can we engage him in the activities we have determined make up the core of our family's value system? How can we make him feel safe and heard when he doesn't have a \"voice\" as others have. And I\u2019m trying to strike the balance between having expectations for my son, and being unrealistic. \n So maybe it\u2019s not an amazing story for anyone else, but I know this is part of the joy in my life; I get to witness these small victories. I get to help Jake learn and watch him gain the kind of skills that most people never even notice. I get to be thankful for things like pincer grasp. And I know I will never take for granted his health, his ability to walk, his sneaky smile, or the one time he handed me a tomato. \n \n \n ****  This post was an editor's pick today at  OpenSalon.com \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://open.salon.com/blog/jennyalice/2011/06/01/he_handed_me_a_tomato"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/06/he-handed-me-tomato.html", "title": "\nHe Handed Me a Tomato.\n"},

Seven. and I can't imagine that she is already seven and that she is only seven because she is both my little baby, in a pink onsie covered in a Sock Monkey print, and she is this spunky, punky, vivacious, perfectly wonderful being, who is wholly a person apart from me. \n \nHer sense of humor is sharp, but not mean-spirited, and so often perfectly timed that I wonder if I might hear the roar of a live, studio-audience behind me. Sometimes I can't even laugh because I am so surprised by her wit, and so proud that she is carrying on the family desire to make others smile. And, honestly, I love that I can tease her, because that is my natural state, and it makes parenting her easier. \n \nShe has learned to find humor when she could be very sad, or irritated, or exasperated. When her older brother walks fully-clothed, and shoed through her freshly filled blow-up pool, tracking mud and dribbling rocks, she admonishes her brother for getting his good shoes wet, not for ruining her swim party. When it was discovered that 19 of 20 fish in her tank had died overnight (another post entirely), she looked like she was going to cry, then pointed to the last fish, and said in a low voice, \"Mur-dur-er. Murderer!\" She stomps her feet when she doesn't get what she wants, and begins to whine with a tone that tears at my eardrums, then stops, centers herself, and drawing her hand from face to chest calls, \"Aaaand SCENE!\" and thanks her audience. \n \nShe loves dolls, well, as of right now she loves dolls, and while I do not understand it, because it is so unlike how I played as a child, I am trying to appreciate it because I know it will go away, just as her round baby face has already begun to turn oval. Her taste in entertainment has her singing songs beyond her years with lyrics that her precious head automatically makes into child-like phrases, and she devours new trends, encouraging our car filled with little girls on the way to wherever, crying out, \"Tonight is the night, we\u2019ll fight 'til it\u2019s over...\" and lifting up her arms they all sing, \"So we put our hands up like the ceiling can\u2019t hold us. Like the ceiling can\u2019t hold us!\"  \n \nShe is grateful most of the time, polite when she is away from us. She cares enough to be dressed appropriately for the event, but can let it go and run out the door without wondering what people will think. She has a sense of fashion that exudes confidence, she wears camo and pink like she invented them both, and was undaunted by a cast she wore for six weeks this year. \n \nShe's sensitive, and is deeply moved by precious babies, perceived oppression, and the idea of loss; her pain in having her best friend move to the other side of the planet was palpable to anyone who witnessed her talking about it. \n \nShe meows sometimes, a little bit like how a friend of mine says \"woof,\" which worries me some, but only because I am not fond of cats. She loves to cuddle up each morning, and still finds it amusing to hide in our bed, and surprise her dad waiting under the covers if she can sneak in while he leaves the room. She loves the drama of \"the big reveal\" of almost anything, and applauds others' efforts even when she wanted something else to happen. \n \nShe understands that where we put our time and our money shapes who we are, knows the names of the states in alphabetical order, and, as much as I can't stand it, still requests to watch America's Funniest Home Videos. Her thirst for media is rarely quenched, and her brain has trouble shutting off at night. Somehow she can still be soothed by my voice, singing softly in the dark; it humbles me. \n \nShe likes to know what information is fact, and which is opinion before deciding anything, which sometimes wears her out. and she carries too much sometimes, chasing issues that are not problems for her to solve. But she is made of the best parts of us, and in her unbroken, seamless state, she remains filled with a persevering light. \n \n \n\u00a0*** \n \n \n \n Happy birthday babyGirl.

Memorial day in Tahoe, Lucy's birthday party, Lucy turning three, Jake being precious with  my parents, me enjoying time with my family. lately: Lucy turned three. She had about 7 million birthday parties: Saturday with 2/3 sets grandparents, Thursday with friends at daycare, Thursday evening with mom & dad, Cousins, Aunt Demanda, favorite baby sitter, Jake's aide and her son, Friday Pizza lunch party with family friends, Saturday surprise sing at an end of the year function which she then thought was another party for her, then Sunday with other 1/3 grandparents, Aunt, cousins, family friends, IRL friends, and anyone else who managed to not be at the other functions. Mommy. All. Done. Birthday. Giving birth to her was a few hours from water breaking to the two pushes it took to get her out... which, as it turns out is WAY easier than celebrating her third birthday. Half of my parents came into town on the third and left on the seventh. On Thursday the 11th which really was Lucy's birthday Jake had sedation to undergo his annual dental work.  My sister came with the boys an hour or so after I got home with Jake. okay I can't even finish this list... it's been crazy, but mostly because Jake  has not slept since Thursday night  when he slept about half the night. It looks a lot like when he was younger and did that crazy bout when he was three or four? I think When he didn't sleep for 52 days in a row... not longer than 20-30 minutes in a row and not more than 1-2 hours in a 24 hour period. Back then he would scream and thrash the entire time between the small resting bits.  Last night, so he would rest (not sleep) , I layed down with him, which is never something he really wants.. and last night he took my arm and pulled it around him so that he drew me close and I was spooning him. I heard his breathing change and he slept a bit. He woke up when Lucy started crying in the other room (she is beginning to have some wild dreams lately.) He sat up, but layed back down when I came back to bed, where he pulled my arm around him again. [silver lining moment] He has had to leave school every day.. kicked the fire extinguisher off the wall, knocked over chairs.. mayhem but today he got to go home because he SAID \"Want home NOW.\"  Clearly so that everyone in the room had heard him.

He had a smile on his face nearly the entire ride, and was very happy. It means there will be many beautiful summer days ahead cruising around the lake with family and friends. And we are thrilled any time we can add another fun activity that is multi-generational and/or multi-family. I was very relieved, and it got me thinking about how much Jake has grown and matured in the last six months. When I went to look through the posts here to read his last birthday post I realized I never actually posted it. So here is a snapshot of Jake from October 2011.\u00a0  \n \n******  \n \nJake turned eleven a few weeks ago, and before another moment goes by I want to remember a few moments of him at this age. \n \nHe has trouble sleeping. Often he will fall asleep early in the evening, then wake up from 9-12 and wander around his room, laughing, playing with toys. If you go to his room he will run to his bed and pull the covers up over himself, but tap the bed to encourage you to sit awhile. He still loves it when I sing to him, and he'll let me pet his hair again after many years of not being able to be still. He lets me share a pillow as he tries to fall asleep. \n \n \n \nHe's always loved the beach, then he loved the shoreline, and now we've added water.\u00a0First he jumped into the deep end of a friend's pool (like all the other pre-teens there), then he went in the lake, then in another pool, and another. He's not as stable as he'd like to be, but he will hold hands without clenching me too tightly, and he loves it when all four of us were together splashing in the water. \n \nHe eats the rest of my lunch that is sitting on the counter, the minute he walks in the house after school. Then he waits at the counter tapping his fingers until I serve him another snack. He's rail-thin, and constantly moving. His hollow legs fill up with an hours-worth of snacks until I can bear no more and force him into the backyard to play. When I turn my back he walks around the kitchen until he finds the one food that was not \"put away\" -a pear. He takes a big bite, laughs and throws the pear onto the counter before slipping outside to play in the afternoon sun. \n \nHe can get in and out of most cars now by himself. Motor planning has never been easy, but he's got it now. And he can \"scootch over\" in a booth--if he wants to. The more his body cooperates, the more brainpower he can use on other things. \n \nGiven the chance, he will sneak down the stairs and crawl out the dog door. It's a game now for him to see how fast he can get out there..will we leave a gate open? will we leave the dog door unlocked? will the door to the hallway blow open in the breeze allowing for his escape? Once he gets out he yells and laughs very loudly so I will know he's there, but I know he's there. No matter how much I try, I am always 45 seconds behind him, which is just enough time to get outside and make mischief. \n \nHe greets guests now, and says goodbye too, in his own way. \u00a0A brief pass by and a gentle brush of his hand across your arm says hello, and more regularly he will walk you to the gate as you leave. It's possible he's just waiting for you to leave it open behind you, but he quite often will stand at the gate until your car drives away. He cares that you've been here. \n \nOn a day that's too hot or too cold, I ask him to settle in on the couch and watch a show-- and he does. He loves Mythbusters. I used to think it was fluke, but he will come in and sit on the couch if he hears the voices of Jamie and Adam. If the tele switches over to record a news program he leaps off the couch to find something else to do, or\u00a0slides the remote control across the floor towards my feet. \n \nHe can take handful of cereal out of a box on the counter without spilling the entire box onto the floor; not every time, but most of the time. Regardless of his success rate, he's trying, and I think he sees the benefit; the more careful he is, the more independence he gains. And independence is what any eleven-year-old boy craves. \n \nHe's gained so much maturity in the last year. I really feel like he is taking the time to connect to us, which is probably because we are trying to do a better job of listening to him, however he is communicating. More than ever, we are offering him choices whenever we can, rather than assume what he wants, even if I know what the answer is probably going to be, because he deserves to have his opinion heard. \n \nHe is closer to being a young man than being my baby now, I know that, but I am thankful he still has some of that little boy sweetness left--just enough clings to his hair that I can remember his tiny baby face when I kiss him good night in the dark.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fIUIccSgBCE/T6dckg3pE6I/AAAAAAAAHGA/oObK4mU5Xpo/s1600/2012-05-05_12-43-48_512.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YCdXpV1cc6M/TqEPKk2J7WI/AAAAAAAAD4w/uPCvWhyQZT0/s1600/Jack2.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/05/snapshot-of-myboy.html", "title": "\nSnapshot of myBoy\n"},
{"date": "08 February, 2012", "body": "\nMy daughter had to count to one hundred tonight for her homework as part of the celebration of the 100th day of school. She also had to put one hundred things in a bag to share with her classmates. Candy would generally be her first choice, but we settled on little slips of paper of places we could think of that she has visited. \n \nThe list was pretty easy to come up with, which is a little surprising considering she's only five years old. And it's a good list, with lots of states and beautiful national parks, inspiring monuments and small and large towns spread across the country. It made me proud that we are showing her the world. \n \nOf course every place on her list is a place on my list too, if I were to indulge myself the time to make such a list... and I was tempted to think of every little town my husband and I visited in Europe that one summer. What was so interesting to me is that so many of those places on my daughter's list were places we saw together for the first time. \n \nand that made me smile, because I am only forty, and there's a lot more to do. \n \n \n I am not ashamed of getting older. I don't really care much about crow's feet. I've been 'long in the tooth' for a long time, and this bust line needs industrial strength reinforcements no matter what age I am. \n \n \n \nI have accomplished so much less than I thought I would have by this age, and I know because I still have the lists I made when I was twenty and life was spread out before me. All I needed was a pen and some college-ruled notebook paper and I was in charge of my destiny. With a scribble I planned three children and graduate school, trips around the world, and a vegetable garden; I would learn to can my own food. \n \nOnce life got rolling it was hard to stop, and no little list is going to dictate when you actually fall in love any way.\u00a0 There were subsequently no plans for things like a broken leg, or home repairs. My list did not have a six year gap between having my children, and no one had a wheelchair repair scheduled annually.  \n \nBut I am finished with those lists, because  I have done so much more than I thought I could  that it is really hard to be disappointed. I have experiences in my life that my little 20-year-old self couldn't imagine if she tried, and they haven't all been great, but I am better for them. I am a much stronger, funnier, capable woman than I had imagined I'd be. I am less restless, and more adventurous. I love more deeply than I ever thought possible. \n \n  and I'm not afraid like I was when I was younger, worried I would never get a chance to check off each thing on those lists.\u00a0 Now all those places I've gone, the things I have learned in just \nthese five years of my daughter's life, the eleven years of my son's life, the fourteen years of my marriage... they lead me to believe that there will be hundreds and hundred \nmore places  I will visit in the next forty years, and I can't even imagine all the things I will get a chance to do. \n \n \n(p.s. I did do a few  things  on that list) \n \n \n \n a version of this post was the editor's pick today at\u00a0 OpenSalon.com \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9IZzEkBjuTo/TzI8vWr_YGI/AAAAAAAAFNM/2NFvxFvDZVY/s1600/21Jen.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bMoQf8TUpQ0/TzI9KtspnYI/AAAAAAAAFNc/p_tfBpWlNBo/s1600/40+Jen.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0692010556/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwmyersr-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0692010556", "http://open.salon.com/blog/jennyalice/2012/02/08/and_then_i_was_forty"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2012/02/and-then-i-was-forty.html", "title": "\nAnd Then I Was Forty\n"},
{"date": "15 June, 2011", "body": "\nMy back hurts. A lot. And my makeup is smeared and my ankle hurts, and my wrist is a little twisted. I am sort of a wreck, but I would chop off a toe with a dull blade if that was also necessary to keep my son safe; a little injury is worth it.. it's always worth it. I will feel better in a few hours, after the adrenaline surge dies down and the kink in my back is ironed out with an anti-inflammatory.  \n \nJake ran away from me in a busy parking lot 20 minutes ago and despite that diagnosis of cerebral palsy ataxia, he moved so quickly that the only way to get him back was to leap and tackle him.. on the asphalt, in the middle of a moving car line at the pick-up where his sister had camp today. \n \nI got a hold of him, straightened myself up and walked on the\u00a0 campus, my hand firmly around his forearm, no longer bothering with his hand at all. A very kind counselor who could not possibly have been more that 18 noticed me, and must have known that something was up by my demeanor. When she asked if I had a question, I broke into tears and said \"My son just escaped my grasp in the parking lot and got away from me. He's fine, but I need to get it together before my daughter sees me.\" She graciously said, \"Why don't I go get her for you and you can take a minute.\" \n \nJake and I sat there on the edge of the little playground, me firmly holding a twisted knot of the back of his shirt, his hands sifting through the tan bark. I wiped my tears, assessed my physical damage, pledged not to be angry with my son, and took a deep breath. \n \nLucy bounded out with the sweet counselor who brushed away any of my apologies as completely unnecessary, and as we left, Lucy said, \"Mom, I want to play on the play structure.\" and headed two feet away from me. I reminded her that she was headed to a birthday party and she happily came next to me and we all got into the car.  \n \n Then I had this flash, not of how frustrated I am, or irritated, or disappointed that such a simple errand could not be completed without major incident.. but a flash of how my son must be having all of those feelings and more. When he \"ran away,\" he probably just wanted to play in the tanbark at the edge of the parking lot. Sitting right near our car was a little slice of what my son must think is paradise. That big fresh pile of tanbark just waiting to be spread abut the flower beds at this beautiful elementary school campus, siren calling him, and he probably just wanted to put his little man-hands through every piece of it.  \n \nHe wasn't necessarily running away, he could have just been running. And how could I possibly know\u00a0 the difference? \n \nCan you imagine having all of the desire to do something as simple as putting your hands in tan bark, and being unable to do it because you just couldn't tell anyone that's what you wanted to do? Lucy asked to play on the play structure, turned away from me, and I certainly didn't lunge after her. \n \nBut, of course, she came back to me. And I know that she would do the same thing in a parking lot, or an airport, or Disneyland. She comes back to me, and before she leaves, she looks both ways to make sure she will be safe. I can count on that. I taught her, and now she knows it, and that's the end of that, and anything other than that is her being naughty, but even at her naughtiest she is always safe. \n \nI remember having a discussion with one of Jake's teachers when he was at his previous school where they had proudly put \"I want to go to the bathroom.\" push-talkers near the door frames of both exits of the classroom, so the children could press the button on their way out the door. I thought it was a great idea, except for the part where Jake is not allowed to get up out of his seat during work time. How could he ever communicate a desire to go to the bathroom if the icon is across the room? How humiliating, how degrading. \n \nDoes he live his life with the hope that I will be there to intuit his needs? That his next caretaker during the day will be able to understand his subtle facial expressions and vocalizations. Here I was, so worried about Jake being injured this afternoon, but I'm not sure that it isn't perhaps more painful for him living every day, just hoping the people around him will take a moment longer try to understand what he wants, where he wants to be. \n \nI am crushed to think of how many times I have been impatient with him, wishing he would just do one single thing I asked him to do, when he is probably wondering if today will be the one day that he gets to choose to play on the play structure, linger. But I can't let go of his arm; I just don't know that what we have tried to teach has stuck in there.  \n \nAnd how will my son ever prove to me that he will come back if I can never trust him enough to let him leave? \n \n ****  This post was an editor's pick today at  OpenSalon.com \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XkYEJwamsqc/TflFDOag99I/AAAAAAAACxY/cWnSglZJ54o/s1600/P3277423.jpg", "http://open.salon.com/blog/jennyalice/2011/06/15/not_running_away_just_running"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/06/not-running-away-just-running.html", "title": "\nNot Running Away, Just Running\n"},
{"date": "27 February, 2013", "body": "\nJake is considered non-verbal. I used to say pre-verbal, but then I realized that was just as insulting, and probably less accurate, since I do not expect him to speak in a clear manner that will be medically or academically recognized, and quite frankly, communication has always been the goal, not speech. But he does say words occasionally; they pop out of nowhere, and they are clear and relevant, and almost always said with a wit that indicates he has a lot going on inside that big brain. He responds to people speaking in Spanish, at about the same level of interest as when he is spoken to in English, so that makes him non-verbal bi-lingual, which is great, because it would be nice to have someone in our house be fluent in Spanish. Whatever way you call it, Jake does not share his thoughts in spoken sentences. \n \nSo I do my best to hear my son. I listen to the way he is tapping his hand on the counter to know whether he is bored or wants more of something. I hear him shuffle through the night around his room, having had his blankets fall off the bed, or become too entangled for him to wrap them around his body. And when I cover him up again, hoping that the fleece blanket will stick to his fleece pajamas, I can hear his \"thank you\", said with his own little chirp, that tells me he is happy and that is all that he needed. I know what joy sounds like. It can't even be typed, but there is a sound that Jake makes as he is set free from the house and let loose upon the sunshine of the day. That sound makes everyone smile. We know what \"happy sounds\" are. We look forward to the \"doot doot dooot doot\" part of the evening lately when he wants to wrestle on the couch, and laughs a lot. \n \nIt's harder for me to hear him in distress. It hurts me, several times maybe, once because I am his mother, and I am supposed to feel an ache which calls me to make my child okay when he cries, or he shows signs of pain in his voice. Then it hurts again, not exactly because I am irritated by the shrill sound he is making, but because of the tremendous disappointment I have in myself for having such a low tolerance for this part of his voice; I want it to stop because I can't do anything well while it happens, including finding a solution to soothe his urgency. And I am hurt again, because I have not figured out a way for Jake to communicate his needs more efficiently, and thus feel I have failed him. And then again I am pained when I realize that I have made his distress all about me, when no matter what I am feeling, it must be immeasurably worse for him not to have a way to communicate what he needs to me, or be physically able to fix his issues on his own. Distress is hard, but we are working on it, working on asking the right questions up front: \"Does something hurt?\" \"Is it your body that hurts, or your feelings?\" \"Do you want medicine for your head?\" And generally, perhaps because there is better incentive, Jake answers by touching my hand quickly so he can get what he needs. \n \nWhat's interesting is trying to figure out how to hear him in a regular moment... not one of great joy or sadness; it's difficult to understand his side of the conversation when he is just being. When he is quiet in the car with me, I am often quiet too instead of asking him questions about his day which I know he cannot answer. I don't narrate the world around him as I did when he was a tiny boy, and everything was new. So we ride in silence, or sit in the quiet house when it is just the two of us. Most people don't think of me as the quiet type, but I admit that being alone with Jake can be so very calming because I am not talk -talk -talking the whole time. \n \nIt is always a relief when we figure out, in retrospect, what Jake has very clearly been telling us. We went to a restaurant the other day with Descartes' parents, and as we were getting settled, Jake half stood up, and made several rather large noises. He was reminded to use his \"quieter voice\" inside, but he insisted once more on calling out. That's when we saw Papa turn and walk towards us and his seat. He was joining our table, and had walked past us. Jake had seen him as he passed, and began calling out as he headed for the door. We had missed him, but Jake hadn't. Once we understood, it was so obvious that he had been calling out, \"Here! We're here!\" Jack sat happily, for the rest of the lunch once we were our little group again.  \n \nWe all had a good laugh, and apologized to Jake. I find myself apologizing to him a lot, for not listening, for \nmisunderstanding, for not understanding at all. I'm hoping that he will \ncontinue to know that we are all trying. \n \nI know we approach his sounds and behaviors with a different level of respect than we used to. I expect that he is trying to communicate something when he comes to me, because it is obvious to me now, that separating himself from whatever he was doing, so he could be right next to me is intent, and if you can't really call out , \"Hey Mom. I need you over here.\" you would need to walk on over. So when he takes my hand, I go where he leads me... I am excited to know what he wants to have happen next. \n \nAt a busy toy store last week we wandered the aisles looking for the perfect gift to give to a little boy. Rows of books, and stuffed animals, toy trains, play structures, and tricycles, this place has it all. After about half an hour, Jake extracted his hand from mine, but did not shoot away in escape mode. Instead, he took my hand, and I told him I would go with him where ever he wanted. He very calmly led me to the back of the store, to an aisle we had not walked down, but to a section you could see from where we had been looking at games earlier. It was a row of car seats. He walked over to the largest one, and started to sit down, or pretended to, or something. I asked, \"Are you trying to say you want to leave now?\" He said, \"Yea-aHHHH.\" and I congratulated him on such a smart way of telling me without running towards the door, or throwing himself down in a way that would get us to leave quickly. \n \nI looked over and a young clerk had been watching us, gawking really, but I caught her eye, and said, \"He doesn't really talk much, but I think that was a very effective way to say he wants to leave, don't you think?\" She let her jaw drop a little, and said, \"Whoa. Cool.\" \n \nYeah, that's what I thought too: \n \nWhoa. Wow. Yeah. Cool. I can totally hear you.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2013/02/tell-me-little-something.html", "title": "\nTell Me A Little Something\n"},
{"date": "22 August, 2011", "body": "\n It's been a great summer. We didn't cross the country, but we did \nsome fun things, and our kids are happy. It's also been a hard summer \nfor me. I worked more, and had less childcare, and no or less school for\n the kids. I had several trips that I went on solo, which were each \namazing, but also required monumental amounts of childcare coordination \nand scheduling. \n \nHere's what I learned on my summer vacation: \n \n All camps should have drive-through drop-off and pick-up. Letting \nthe baby sleep, keeping the special needs kid buckled-in safely, or the \ndog comfortably stay in the car is so wonderful. I am ever-thankful to \nthe camps that made things easier for parents this summer. It specifically made my life less complicated. \n We need to figure out a way for there to be childcare for special \nneeds children. Really. What happens to all of those aids when school lets out? \nWhat happens to those aids after 1pm every afternoon. Finding childcare \nfor a special needs kid is always hard, somehow during the summer it is a\n lot harder. Maybe we could private pay our schools to have after school\n care like every other typical kid has? Where is the after-school care \nfor special needs children? \n Camp for my son is one of the most awesome experiences we have as a \nfamily. He gets time in the woods with people who focus on him. We know \nhe's safe so we can relax and leave the doors unlocked for a few days. \nIf you have a camp in your area that offers care for special needs \nkids.. make a donation to them today. They are life savers for the \nparents, and the learning the children and adults do at those camps is \nlife-changing.\u00a0 \n Air conditioning is not a luxury for our family. If things get \"more\n than regular\" difficult and I am hot, I cannot function. The first \nthings I do is turn on the air conditioning when I am going to need to \ndeal with something hard in our house or car. \n My children love the outdoors. I've always known this, but it is \namazing how happy they are when we are in a National or State park. It's\n like they might actually be 'getting' the lessons we are teaching them \nabout the beauty of this country, and the amazing natural resources we \nhave right here in our own state that no one else in the world has.\u00a0 \n From our house, it's possible to drive to Yosemite for dinner, and \nwe will be doing that at least once every summer. It is ridiculous not \nto. If you live that close to a National Park, please go, or send a \ndonation in to keep it well-staffed and full of rangers who answer every\n single question my daughter can squeeze in. \n \n It's also possible to get to Muir Woods before lunch; even with a \ngaggle of children. We will be doing this more often as well. A lot of \nit is wheelchair accessible.  \n \n I get teary-eyed every time I'm in a National Park. I am just that sappy. \n In-n-Out Burger can provide the right nutrition and fun for my \nfamily, and as long as we don't do it all the time, it is not only okay,\n it is a happy, inexpensive treat that makes everyone relaxed. And if \nyou go to In-n-Out\u00a0 and then stop by my house, assume one of my children\n will steal your milkshake. They don't care if you have a cold. \n \n I need to put in automatic sprinklers in the front yard. I cannot \nactually water that many square feet every single day by hand. It looks \nlike my front yard is a chapter out of  The Grapes of Wrath , and the crops from our garden this summer are about as good as a 1937 Texas panhandle farm.\u00a0 \n My\n son has a lot to say if we are willing to wait patiently for him to \nanswer the questions we ask him. Once again, he is teaching me that I \nhave a lot to learn about listening and not assuming.  \n Home-brewed beer is awesome, not that hard to make, and something my husband and I can do together that does not involve leaving the house or watching television. \n \n I miss my family when I don't see them, and even though I make them crazy, I think they might miss me too. As much as I love living in the Bay Area, it has been a summer with no visits to my family in the O.C.\u00a0 \n Buying school supplies for my \n  kindergartner was unexpectedly one of the most exciting and heartbreaking things I've done lately; there are no more babies in my house.\u00a0 \n Always buy more sunblock than you think you will need. Now that we have taught children that they  must wear sunblock , it is very hard to get them out of the house/car without it.  \n I live in such a great, warm, activity-filled city, and we love going to all of the music in the park concerts. We have also discovered another version of a perfect summer Saturday in our town: farmer's market with friends, beer garten with those friends, and more friends, splashing and running around the downtown square fountains, then home for a family nap.  \n and, of course, I figured out that my children will get older no matter how hard I hug them. I knew we were all going to grow up someday, I just didn't see it coming for a few more years. \n \nI hope you had a wonderful summer. We had our first day of kindergarten this morning:\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Wny0NwXhYXA/TlJ-TZzJM8I/AAAAAAAADYk/biOU7kfvMi0/s1600/first+day%2521.jpg"], "link": "http://www.jennyalice.com/2011/08/things-i-learned-this-summer.html", "title": "\nThings I Learned This Summer\n"}
